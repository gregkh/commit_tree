staging: comedi: ni_labpc_isadma: move dma programming out of labpc_drain_dma()

The external caller of labpc_drain_dma() does not enable the DMA transfer. Only
the call from handle_isa_dma() results in the programmed DMA operation getting
enabled.

For aesthetics, move the dma programming to handle_isa_dma(). Make sure the
DMA operation would actually do something (dma->size != 0) before programming
it to avoid enabling the DMA at the end of a stop_src == TRIG_COUNT command.
