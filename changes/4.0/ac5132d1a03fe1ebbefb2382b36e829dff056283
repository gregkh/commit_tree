vxlan: Only bind to sockets with compatible flags enabled

A VXLAN net_device looking for an appropriate socket may only consider
a socket which has a matching set of flags/extensions enabled. If
incompatible flags are enabled, return a conflict to have the caller
create a distinct socket with distinct port.

The OVS VXLAN port is kept unaware of extensions at this point.
