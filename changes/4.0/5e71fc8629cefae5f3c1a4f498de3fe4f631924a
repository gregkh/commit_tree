USB: keyspan_pda: add new device id

Add USB VID/PID for Xircom PGMFHUB USB/serial component.  (The hub and SCSI
bridge on that hardware are recognized out of the box by existing drivers.)
Tested VID/PID using new_id and loopback connection and was met with
success, but that's all the testing done.
