xfs: set buf types when converting extent formats

Conversion from local to extent format does not set the buffer type
correctly on the new extent buffer when a symlink data is moved out
of line.

Fix the symlink code and leave a comment in the generic bmap code
reminding us that the format-specific data copy needs to set the
destination buffer type appropriately.
