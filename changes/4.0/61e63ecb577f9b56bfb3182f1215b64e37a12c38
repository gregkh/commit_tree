xfs: consolidate superblock logging functions

We now have several superblock loggin functions that are identical
except for the transaction reservation and whether it shoul dbe a
synchronous transaction or not. Consolidate these all into a single
function, a single reserveration and a sync flag and call it
xfs_sync_sb().

Also, xfs_mod_sb() is not really a modification function - it's the
operation of logging the superblock buffer. hence change the name of
it to reflect this.

Note that we have to change the mp->m_update_flags that are passed
around at mount time to a boolean simply to indicate a superblock
update is needed.
