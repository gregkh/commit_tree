x86: Store a per-cpu shadow copy of CR4

Context switches and TLB flushes can change individual bits of CR4.
CR4 reads take several cycles, so store a shadow copy of CR4 in a
per-cpu variable.

To avoid wasting a cache line, I added the CR4 shadow to
cpu_tlbstate, which is already touched in switch_mm.  The heaviest
users of the cr4 shadow will be switch_mm and __switch_to_xtra, and
__switch_to_xtra is called shortly after switch_mm during context
switch, so the cacheline is likely to be hot.
