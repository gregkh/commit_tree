Merge branch 'pci/host-generic' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci into acpi-resources

modified:   drivers/of/of_pci.c

This fixes a build failure after merging the 'acpi-resources' branch
with the PCI tree caused by bad interactions between that branch and
the only commit in 'pci/host-generic'.  Also that commit contains a
bug which can be fixed by removing one line of code, so do that too.
