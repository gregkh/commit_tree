MIPS: ip22-gio: Remove legacy suspend/resume support

There are currently no gio device drivers that implement suspend/resume
and this patch removes the bus specific legacy suspend and resume callbacks.
This will allow us to eventually remove struct bus_type legacy suspend and
resume support altogether.

gio device drivers wanting to implement suspend and resume can use dev PM
ops which will work out of the box without further modifications necessary.
