nios2: fix cache coherency issue when debug with gdb

Remove the end address checking for flushda function. We need to flush
each address line for flushda instruction, from start to end address.
This is because flushda instruction only flush the cache if tag and line
fields are matched.

Change to use ldwio instruction (bypass cache) to load the instruction
that causing trap. Our interest is the actual instruction that executed
by the processor, this should be uncached.
Note, EA address might be an userspace cached address.
