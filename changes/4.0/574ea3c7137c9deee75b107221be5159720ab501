Bluetooth: Fix dependency for BR/EDR Secure Connections mode on SSP

The BR/EDR Secure Connections feature should only be enabled when the
Secure Simple Pairing mode has been enabled first. However since secure
connections is feature that is valid for BR/EDR and LE, this needs
special handling.

When enabling secure connections on a LE only configured controller,
thent the BR/EDR side should not be enabled in the controller. This
patches makes the BR/EDR Secure Connections feature depending on
enabling Secure Simple Pairing mode first.
