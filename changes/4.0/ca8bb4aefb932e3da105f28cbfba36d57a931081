serial: 8250: Revert "tty: serial: 8250_core: read only RX if there is something in the FIFO"

This reverts commit 0aa525d11859c1a4d5b78fdc704148e2ae03ae13.

The conditional RX-FIFO read seems to cause spurious interrupts and we
see just:
|serial8250: too much work for irq29

The previous behaviour was "default" for decades and Marvell's 88f6282 SoC
might not be the only that relies on it. Therefore the Omap fix is
reverted for now.

something in the FIFO")
