arm64: kvm: decode ESR_ELx.EC when reporting exceptions

To aid the developer when something triggers an unexpected exception,
decode the ESR_ELx.EC field when logging an ESR_ELx value using the
newly introduced esr_get_class_string. This doesn't tell the developer
the specifics of the exception encoded in the remaining IL and ISS bits,
but it can be helpful to distinguish between exception classes (e.g.
SError and a data abort) without having to manually decode the field,
which can be tiresome.
