cpuset: Fix cpuset sched_relax_domain_level

The cpuset.sched_relax_domain_level can control how far we do
immediate load balancing on a system. However, it was found on recent
kernels that echo'ing a value into cpuset.sched_relax_domain_level
did not reduce any immediate load balancing.

The reason this occurred was because the update_domain_attr_tree() traversal
did not update for the "top_cpuset". This resulted in nothing being changed
when modifying the sched_relax_domain_level parameter.

This patch is able to address that problem by having update_domain_attr_tree()
allow updates for the root in the cpuset traversal.
