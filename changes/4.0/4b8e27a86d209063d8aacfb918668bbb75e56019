cxgb4: Allocate dynamic mem. for egress and ingress queue maps

QIDs (egress/ingress) from firmware in FW_*_CMD.alloc command
can be anywhere in the range from EQ(IQFLINT)_START to EQ(IQFLINT)_END.
For eg, in the first load eqid can be from 100 to 300.
In the next load it can be from 301 to 500 (assume eq_start is 100 and eq_end is
1000).

The driver was assuming them to always start from EQ(IQFLINT)_START till
MAX_EGRQ(INGQ). This was causing stack overflow and subsequent crash.

Fixed it by dynamically allocating memory (of qsize (x_END - x_START + 1)) for
these structures.
