hpsa: fix race between abort handler and main i/o path

This means changing the allocator to reference count commands.
The reference count is now the authoritative indicator of whether a
command is allocated or not.  The h->cmd_pool_bits bitmap is now
only a heuristic hint to speed up the allocation process, it is no
longer the authoritative record of allocated commands.

Since we changed the command allocator to use reference counting
as the authoritative indicator of whether a command is allocated,
fail_all_outstanding_cmds needs to use the reference count not
h->cmd_pool_bits for this purpose.

Fix hpsa_drain_accel_commands to use the reference count as the
authoritative indicator of whether a command is allocated instead of
the h->cmd_pool_bits bitmap.
