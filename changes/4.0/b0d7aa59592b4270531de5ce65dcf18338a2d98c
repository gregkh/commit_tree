cfg80211: allow wiphy specific regdomain management

Add a new regulatory flag that allows a driver to manage regdomain
changes/updates for its own wiphy.
A self-managed wiphys only employs regulatory information obtained from
the FW and driver and does not use other cfg80211 sources like
beacon-hints, country-code IEs and hints from other devices on the same
system. Conversely, a self-managed wiphy does not share its regulatory
hints with other devices in the system. If a system contains several
devices, one or more of which are self-managed, there might be
contradictory regulatory settings between them. Usage of flag is
generally discouraged. Only use it if the FW/driver is incompatible
with non-locally originated hints.

A new API lets the driver send a complete regdomain, to be applied on
its wiphy only.

After a wiphy-specific regdomain change takes place, usermode will get
a new type of change notification. The regulatory core also takes care
enforce regulatory restrictions, in case some interfaces are on
forbidden channels.
