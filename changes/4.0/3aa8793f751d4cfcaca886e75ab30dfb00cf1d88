mmc: core: Initial support for MMC power sequences

System on chip designs may specify a specific MMC power sequence. To
successfully detect an (e)MMC/SD/SDIO card, that power sequence must
be followed while initializing the card.

To be able to handle these SOC specific power sequences, let's add a
MMC power sequence interface. It provides the following functions to
help the mmc core to deal with these power sequences.

mmc_pwrseq_alloc() - Invoked from mmc_of_parse(), to initialize data.
mmc_pwrseq_pre_power_on()- Invoked in the beginning of mmc_power_up().
mmc_pwrseq_post_power_on()- Invoked at the end in mmc_power_up().
mmc_pwrseq_power_off()- Invoked from mmc_power_off().
mmc_pwrseq_free() - Invoked from mmc_free_host(), to free data.

Each MMC power sequence provider will be responsible to implement a set
of callbacks. These callbacks mirrors the functions above.

This patch adds the skeleton, following patches will extend the core of
the MMC power sequence and add support for a specific simple MMC power
sequence.

Do note, since the mmc_pwrseq_alloc() is invoked from mmc_of_parse(),
host drivers needs to make use of this API to enable the support for
MMC power sequences. Moreover the MMC power sequence support depends on
CONFIG_OF.
