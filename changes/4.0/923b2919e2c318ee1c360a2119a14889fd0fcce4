xen/gntdev: mark userspace PTEs as special on x86 PV guests

In an x86 PV guest, get_user_pages_fast() on a userspace address range
containing foreign mappings does not work correctly because the M2P
lookup of the MFN from a userspace PTE may return the wrong page.

Force get_user_pages_fast() to fail on such addresses by marking the PTEs
as special.

If Xen has XENFEAT_gnttab_map_avail_bits (available since at least
4.0), we can do so efficiently in the grant map hypercall.  Otherwise,
it needs to be done afterwards.  This is both inefficient and racy
(the mapping is visible to the task before we fixup the PTEs), but
will be fine for well-behaved applications that do not use the mapping
until after the mmap() system call returns.

Guests with XENFEAT_auto_translated_physmap (ARM and x86 HVM or PVH)
do not need this since get_user_pages() has always worked correctly
for them.
