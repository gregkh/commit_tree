Revert "smc91x: retrieve IRQ and trigger flags in a modern way"

The commit breaks the legacy platforms, ie. these not using device-tree,
and setting up the interrupt resources with a flag to activate edge
detection. The issue was found on the zylonite platform.

The reason is that zylonite uses platform resources to pass the interrupt number
and the irq flags (here IORESOURCE_IRQ_HIGHEDGE). It expects the driver to
request the irq with these flags, which in turn setups the irq as high edge
triggered.

After the patch, this was supposed to be taken care of with :
  irq_resflags = irqd_get_trigger_type(irq_get_irq_data(ndev->irq));

But irq_resflags is 0 for legacy platforms, while for example in
arch/arm/mach-pxa/zylonite.c, in struct resource smc91x_resources[] the
irq flag is specified. This breaks zylonite because the interrupt is not
setup as triggered, and hardware doesn't provide interrupts.
