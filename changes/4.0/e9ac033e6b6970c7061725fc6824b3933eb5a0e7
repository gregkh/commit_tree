KVM: nVMX: Improve nested msr switch checking

This patch improve checks required by Intel Software Developer Manual.
 - SMM MSRs are not allowed.
 - microcode MSRs are not allowed.
 - check x2apic MSRs only when LAPIC is in x2apic mode.
 - MSR switch areas must be aligned to 16 bytes.
 - address of first and last byte in MSR switch areas should not set any bits
   beyond the processor's physical-address width.

Also it adds warning messages on failures during MSR switch. These messages
are useful for people who debug their VMMs in nVMX.
