console: Fix console name size mismatch

commit 6ae9200f2cab7 ("enlarge console.name") increased the storage
for the console name to 16 bytes, but not the corresponding
struct console_cmdline::name storage. Console names longer than
8 bytes cause read beyond end-of-string and failure to match
console; I'm not sure if there are other unexpected consequences.
