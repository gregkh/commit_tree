ixgbevf: combine all of the tasks into a single service task

This change combines the reset and watchdog tasklets into a single task.

The advantage of this is that we can avoid multiple schedules of the reset
task when we have a reset event needed due to either the mailbox going down
or transmit packets being present on a link down.
