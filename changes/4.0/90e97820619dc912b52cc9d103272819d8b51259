resources: Move struct resource_list_entry from ACPI into resource core

Currently ACPI, PCI and pnp all implement the same resource list
management with different data structure. We need to transfer from
one data structure into another when passing resources from one
subsystem into another subsystem. So move struct resource_list_entry
from ACPI into resource core and rename it as resource_entry,
then it could be reused by different subystems and avoid the data
structure conversion.

Introduce dedicated header file resource_ext.h instead of embedding
it into ioport.h to avoid header file inclusion order issues.
