dmaengine: k3: Fix duplicated function name and allmodconfig build

While splitting device control in db08425ebd51 ("dmaengine: k3:
Split device_control") new function with the same 'k3_dma_resume' name
was added, leading to build error:

drivers/dma/k3dma.c:823:12: error: conflicting types for ‘k3_dma_resume’
drivers/dma/k3dma.c:625:12: note: previous definition of ‘k3_dma_resume’ was here
