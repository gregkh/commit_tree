Staging: wlan-ng: hfa384x_usb: fixed an 'else' statement coding style issue

Removed useless 'else' statement that followed an 'if' statement that
had a return 1 and moved all the content from the 'else' to outside of
the switch case, this way if any case is sufficient it returns '1',
otherwise it will return 0.
