drm/i915/bdw: Enable execlists by default where supported

Execlist support in the i915 driver is now considered good enough for the
feature to be enabled by default on Gen8 and later and routinely tested.
Adjusted i915 parameters structure initialization to reflect this and updated
the comment in intel_sanitize_enable_execlists().

There's still work to do before we can let the wider massive onto it,
but there's still time left before the 3.20 cutoff.

v2: Update the MODULE_PARM_DESC too.
