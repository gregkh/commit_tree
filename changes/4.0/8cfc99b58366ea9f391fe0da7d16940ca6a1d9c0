s390: add pci_iomap_range

Virtio drivers should map the part of the range they need, not
necessarily all of it.
To this end, support mapping ranges within BAR on s390.
Since multiple ranges can now be mapped within a BAR, we keep track of
the number of mappings created, and only clear out the mapping for a BAR
when this number reaches 0.
