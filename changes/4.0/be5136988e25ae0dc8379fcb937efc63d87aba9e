MIPS: asm: compiler: Add new macros to set ISA and arch asm annotations

There are certain places where the code uses .set mips32 or .set mips64
or .set arch=r4000. In preparation of MIPS R6 support, and in order to
use as less #ifdefs as possible, we define new macros to set similar
annotations for MIPS R6.
