mac80211: avoid races related to suspend flow

When we go to suspend, there is complex set of states that
avoids races. The quiescing variable is set whlie
__ieee80211_suspend is running. Then suspended is set.
The code makes sure there is no window without any of these
flags.

The problem is that workers can still be enqueued while we
are quiescing. This leads to situations where the driver is
already suspending and other flows like disassociation are
handled by a worker.

To fix this, we need to check quiescing and suspended flags
in the worker itself and not only before enqueueing it.
I also add here extensive documentation to ease the
understanding of these complex issues.
