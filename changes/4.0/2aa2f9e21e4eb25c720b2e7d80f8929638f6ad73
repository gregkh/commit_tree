lib/vsprintf.c: improve sanity check in vsnprintf()

On 64 bit, size may very well be huge even if bit 31 happens to be 0.
Somehow it doesn't feel right that one can pass a 5 GiB buffer but not a
3 GiB one.  So cap at INT_MAX as was probably the intention all along.
This is also the made-up value passed by sprintf and vsprintf.
