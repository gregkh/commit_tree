cpufreq: stats: don't update stats from show_trans_table()

cpufreq_stats_update() updates time_in_state and nothing else. It should ideally
be updated only in two cases:
- User requested for the current value of time_in_state.
- We have switched states and so need to update time for the last state.

Currently, we are also doing this while user asks for the transition table of
frequencies. It wouldn't do any harm, but no good as well. Its useless here.

Remove it.
