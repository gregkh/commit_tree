blk-mq: add tag allocation policy

This is the blk-mq part to support tag allocation policy. The default
allocation policy isn't changed (though it's not a strict FIFO). The new
policy is round-robin for libata. But it's a try-best implementation. If
multiple tasks are competing, the tags returned will be mixed (which is
unavoidable even with !mq, as requests from different tasks can be
mixed in queue)
