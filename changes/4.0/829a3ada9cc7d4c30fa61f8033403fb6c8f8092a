geneve: Simplify locking.

The existing Geneve locking scheme was pulled over directly from
VXLAN. However, VXLAN has a number of built in mechanisms which make
the locking more complex and are unlikely to be necessary with Geneve.
This simplifies the locking to use a basic scheme of a mutex
when doing updates plus RCU on receive.

In addition to making the code easier to read, this also avoids the
possibility of a race when creating or destroying sockets since
UDP sockets and the list of Geneve sockets are protected by different
locks. After this change, the entire operation is atomic.
