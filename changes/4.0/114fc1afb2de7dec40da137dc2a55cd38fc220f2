hexdump: make it return number of bytes placed in buffer

This patch makes hexdump return the number of bytes placed in the buffer
excluding trailing NUL.  In the case of overflow it returns the desired
amount of bytes to produce the entire dump.  Thus, it mimics snprintf().

This will be useful for users that would like to repeat with a bigger
buffer.
