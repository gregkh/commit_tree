ARM: 8286/1: mm: Fix dma_contiguous_reserve comment

DMA contiguous allocations have been able to use highmem since commit
"95b0e65 ARM: mm: don't limit default CMA region only to low memory"
but a comment still notes the earlier "low memory" limitation.  Update
the comment to remove the low memory limitation and fix the
s/contigouos/contiguous/ typo while we're at it.
