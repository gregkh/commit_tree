kdb: Avoid printing KERN_ levels to consoles

Currently when kdb traps printk messages then the raw log level prefix
(consisting of '\001' followed by a numeral) does not get stripped off
before the message is issued to the various I/O handlers supported by
kdb. This causes annoying visual noise as well as causing problems
grepping for ^. It is also a change of behaviour compared to normal usage
of printk() usage. For example <SysRq>-h ends up with different output to
that of kdb's "sr h".

This patch addresses the problem by stripping log levels from messages
before they are issued to the I/O handlers. printk() which can also
act as an i/o handler in some cases is special cased; if the caller
provided a log level then the prefix will be preserved when sent to
printk().

The addition of non-printable characters to the output of kdb commands is a
regression, albeit and extremely elderly one, introduced by commit
04d2c8c83d0e ("printk: convert the format for KERN_<LEVEL> to a 2 byte
pattern"). Note also that this patch does *not* restore the original
behaviour from v3.5. Instead it makes printk() from within a kdb command
display the message without any prefix (i.e. like printk() normally does).
