xen-netback: always fully coalesce guest Rx packets

Always fully coalesce guest Rx packets into the minimum number of ring
slots.  Reducing the number of slots per packet has significant
performance benefits when receiving off-host traffic.

Results from XenServer's performance benchmarks:

                         Baseline    Full coalesce
Interhost VM receive      7.2 Gb/s   11 Gb/s
Interhost aggregate      24 Gb/s     24 Gb/s
Intrahost single stream  14 Gb/s     14 Gb/s
Intrahost aggregate      34 Gb/s     34 Gb/s

However, this can increase the number of grant ops per packet which
decreases performance of backend (dom0) to VM traffic (by ~10%)
/unless/ grant copy has been optimized for adjacent ops with the same
source or destination (see "grant-table: defer releasing pages
acquired in a grant copy"[1] expected in Xen 4.6).
