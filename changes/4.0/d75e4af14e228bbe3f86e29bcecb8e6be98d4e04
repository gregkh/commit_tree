cpuidle: remove state_count field from struct cpuidle_device

Thomas Schlichter reports the following issue on his Samsung NC20:

"The C-states C1 and C2 to the OS when connected to AC, and additionally
 provides the C3 C-state when disconnected from AC.  However, the number
 of C-states shown in sysfs is fixed to the number of C-states present
 at boot.
   If I boot with AC connected, I always only see the C-states up to C2
   even if I disconnect AC.

   The reason is commit 130a5f692425 (ACPI / cpuidle: remove dev->state_count
   setting).  It removes the update of dev->state_count, but sysfs uses
   exactly this variable to show the C-states.

   The fix is to use drv->state_count in sysfs.  As this is currently the
   last user of dev->state_count, this variable can be completely removed."

Remove dev->state_count as per the above.
