ARM: 8260/1: l2c: Add interface to ask hypervisor to configure L2C

Because certain secure hypervisor do not allow writes to individual L2C
registers, but rather expect set of parameters to be passed as argument
to secure monitor calls, there is a need to provide an interface for the
L2C driver to ask the firmware to configure the hardware according to
specified parameters. This patch adds such.
