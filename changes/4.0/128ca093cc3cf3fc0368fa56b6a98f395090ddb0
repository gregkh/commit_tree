kvm: iommu: Add cond_resched to legacy device assignment code

When assigning devices to large memory guests (>=128GB guest
memory in the failure case) the functions to create the
IOMMU page-tables for the whole guest might run for a very
long time. On non-preemptible kernels this might cause
Soft-Lockup warnings. Fix these by adding a cond_resched()
to the mapping and unmapping loops.
