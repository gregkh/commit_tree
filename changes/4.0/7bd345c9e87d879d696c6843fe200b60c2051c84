ASoC: Intel: set initial runtime PM status to active for ACPI-enumerated ADSP

The ADSP on Braswell/Baytrail is an ACPI device. This patch sets its initial
runtime PM status to active. Otherwise, its initial status is suspended and
runtime_suspend ops will not be called after probe and thus cannot further
trigger ACPI _PS3 (D3) method to put the device into low power D3cold state.
