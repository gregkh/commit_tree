rhashtable: remove indirection for grow/shrink decision functions

Currently, all real users of rhashtable default their grow and shrink
decision functions to rht_grow_above_75() and rht_shrink_below_30(),
so that there's currently no need to have this explicitly selectable.

It can/should be generic and private inside rhashtable until a real
use case pops up. Since we can make this private, we'll save us this
additional indirection layer and can improve insertion/deletion time
as well.
