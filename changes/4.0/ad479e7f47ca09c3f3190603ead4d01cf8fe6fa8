ACPI / EC: Introduce STARTED/STOPPED flags to replace BLOCKED flag

By using the 2 flags, we can indicate an inter-mediate state where the
current transactions should be completed while the new transactions should
be dropped.

The comparison of the old flag and the new flags:
  Old			New
  about to set BLOCKED	STOPPED set / STARTED set
  BLOCKED set		STOPPED clear / STARTED clear
  BLOCKED clear		STOPPED clear / STARTED set
A new period can be indicated by the 2 flags. The new period is between the
point where we are about to set BLOCKED and the point when the BLOCKED is
set. The new flags facilitate us with acpi_ec_started() check to allow the
EC transaction to be submitted during the new period. This period thus can
be used as a grace period for the EC transaction flushing.

The only functional change after applying this patch is:
1. The GPE enabling/disabling is protected by the EC specific lock. We can
   do this because of recent ACPICA GPE API enhancement. This is reasonable
   as the GPE disabling/enabling state should only be determined by the EC
   driver's state machine which is protected by the EC spinlock.
