ipmi: Cleanup DEBUG_TIMING ifdef usage

The driver uses #ifdef DEBUG_TIMING in order to conditionally print out
timestamped debug messages. Unfortunately it adds the ifdefs all over the
usage sites.

This patch cleans it up by adding a debug_timestamp() function which
is compiled out if DEBUG_TIMING isn't present. This cleans up all
the ugly ifdefs in the function logic.
