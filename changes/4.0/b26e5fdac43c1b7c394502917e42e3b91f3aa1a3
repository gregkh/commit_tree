arm/arm64: KVM: introduce per-VM ops

Currently we only have one virtual GIC model supported, so all guests
use the same emulation code. With the addition of another model we
end up with different guests using potentially different vGIC models,
so we have to split up some functions to be per VM.
Introduce a vgic_vm_ops struct to hold function pointers for those
functions that are different and provide the necessary code to
initialize them.
Also split up the vgic_init() function to separate out VGIC model
specific functionality into a separate function, which will later be
different for a GICv3 model.
