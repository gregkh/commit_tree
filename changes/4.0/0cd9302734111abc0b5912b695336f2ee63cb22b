net/mlx4_core: Reset flow activation upon SRIOV fatal command cases

When SRIOV commands are executed over the comm-channel and get
a fatal error (e.g. timeout, closing command failure) the VF enters
into error state and reset flow is activated.

To be able to recognize whether the failure was on a closing command, the
operational code for the given VHCR command is used. Once the device entered
into an error state we prevent redundant error messages from being printed.
