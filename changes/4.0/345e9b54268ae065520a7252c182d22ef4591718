fib_trie: Push rcu_read_lock/unlock to callers

This change is to start cleaning up some of the rcu_read_lock/unlock
handling.  I realized while reviewing the code there are several spots that
I don't believe are being handled correctly or are masking warnings by
locally calling rcu_read_lock/unlock instead of calling them at the correct
level.

A common example is a call to fib_get_table followed by fib_table_lookup.
The rcu_read_lock/unlock ought to wrap both but there are several spots where
they were not wrapped.
