iio: buffer: Make length attribute read only for buffers without set_length

If a buffer implementation does not implement the set_length() callback the
length will be static and can not be changed by userspace. Mark the length
attribute as a read only property in this case so userspace is aware of this
rather than just silently accepting any length value.
