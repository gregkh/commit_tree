mm: fix anon_vma->degree underflow in anon_vma endless growing prevention

I have constantly stumbled upon "kernel BUG at mm/rmap.c:399!" after
upgrading to 3.19 and had no luck with 4.0-rc1 neither.

So, after looking into new logic introduced by commit 7a3ef208e662 ("mm:
prevent endless growth of anon_vma hierarchy"), I found chances are that
unlink_anon_vmas() is called without incrementing dst->anon_vma->degree
in anon_vma_clone() due to allocation failure.  If dst->anon_vma is not
NULL in error path, its degree will be incorrectly decremented in
unlink_anon_vmas() and eventually underflow when exiting as a result of
another call to unlink_anon_vmas().  That's how "kernel BUG at
mm/rmap.c:399!" is triggered for me.

This patch fixes the underflow by dropping dst->anon_vma when allocation
fails.  It's safe to do so regardless of original value of dst->anon_vma
because dst->anon_vma doesn't have valid meaning if anon_vma_clone()
fails.  Besides, callers don't care dst->anon_vma in such case neither.

Also suggested by Michal Hocko, we can clean up vma_adjust() a bit as
anon_vma_clone() now does the work.
