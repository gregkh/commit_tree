cxl: Add tracepoints

This patch adds tracepoints throughout the cxl driver, which can provide
insight into:

- Context lifetimes
- Commands sent to the PSL and AFU and their completion status
- Segment and page table misses and their resolution
- PSL and AFU interrupts
- slbia calls from the powerpc copro_fault code

These tracepoints are mostly intended to aid in debugging (particularly
for new AFU designs), and may be useful standalone or in conjunction
with hardware traces collected by the PSL (read out via the trace
interface in debugfs) and AFUs.
