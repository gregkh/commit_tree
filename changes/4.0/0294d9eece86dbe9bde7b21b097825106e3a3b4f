iwlwifi: mvm: let the firmware configure the scheduler

A new host command can be used to configure the scheduler
instead of accessing the scheduler's registers from the
driver. This is easier and less error prone since accessing
the hardware at certain moments can lead to races with the
firmware.
Prefer to use the host command whenever it is available.
