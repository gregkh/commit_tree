rhashtable: rhashtable_remove() must unlink in both tbl and future_tbl

As removals can occur during resizes, entries may be referred to from
both tbl and future_tbl when the removal is requested. Therefore
rhashtable_remove() must unlink the entry in both tables if this is
the case. The existing code did search both tables but stopped when it
hit the first match.

Failing to unlink in both tables resulted in use after free.
