usb: chipidea: otg: add a_alt_hnp_support response for B device

This patch adds response to a_alt_hnp_support set feature request from legacy
A device, that is, B-device can provide a message to the user indicating that
the user needs to connect the B-device to an alternate port on the A-device.
A device sets this feature indicates to the B-device that it is connected
to an A-device port that is not capable of HNP, but that the A-device does have
an alternate port that is capable of HNP.
