arm64: introduce common ESR_ELx_* definitions

Currently we have separate ESR_EL{1,2}_* macros, despite the fact that
the encodings are common. While encodings are architected to refer to
the current EL or a lower EL, the macros refer to particular ELs (e.g.
ESR_ELx_EC_DABT_EL0). Having these duplicate definitions is redundant,
and their naming is misleading.

This patch introduces common ESR_ELx_* macros that can be used in all
cases, in preparation for later patches which will migrate existing
users over. Some additional cleanups are made in the process:

* Suffixes for particular exception levelts (e.g. _EL0, _EL1) are
  replaced with more general _LOW and _CUR suffixes, matching the
  architectural intent.

* ESR_ELx_EC_WFx, rather than ESR_ELx_EC_WFI is introduced, as this
  EC encoding covers traps from both WFE and WFI. Similarly,
  ESR_ELx_WFx_ISS_WFE rather than ESR_ELx_EC_WFI_ISS_WFE is introduced.

* Multi-bit fields are given consistently named _SHIFT and _MASK macros.

* UL() is used for compatiblity with assembly files.

* Comments are added for currently unallocated ESR_ELx.EC encodings.

For fields other than ESR_ELx.EC, macros are only implemented for fields
for which there is already an ESR_EL{1,2}_* macro.
