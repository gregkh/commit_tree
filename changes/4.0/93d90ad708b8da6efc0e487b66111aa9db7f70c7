drm/nouveau/sec: separate from cipher (formerly crypt)

Switch to NVIDIA's name for the device.

The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).

Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
naming to ease collaboration with them.
