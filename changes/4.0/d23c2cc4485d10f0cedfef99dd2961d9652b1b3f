ALSA: fireworks/bebob/dice/oxfw: allow stream destructor after releasing runtime

Currently stream destructor in each driver has a problem to be called in
a context in which sound card object is released, because the destructors
call amdtp_stream_pcm_abort() and touch PCM runtime data.

The PCM runtime data is destroyed in application's context with
snd_pcm_close(), on the other hand PCM substream data is destroyed after
sound card object is released, in most case after all of ALSA character
devices are released. When PCM runtime is destroyed and PCM substream is
remained, amdtp_stream_pcm_abort() touches PCM runtime data and causes
Null-pointer-dereference.

This commit changes stream destructors and allows each driver to call
it after releasing runtime.
