drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1685.c: fix conditional in ds1685_rtc_sysfs_time_regs_{show,store}

Fix a conditional statement checking for NULL in both
ds1685_rtc_sysfs_time_regs_show and ds1685_rtc_sysfs_time_regs_store
that was using a logical AND when it should be using a logical OR so
that we fail out of the function properly if the condition ever
evaluates to true.
