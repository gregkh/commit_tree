usb: dwc2: gadget: manage ep0 state in software

Manage ep0 state in software to add handling of status OUT stage.
Just toggling hsotg->setup in s3c_hsotg_handle_outdone leaves it in
wrong state in 2-stage control transfers.
Moreover, ensure that for setup-packet s3c_hsotg_handle_outdone is
called either from SetupDone or OutDone but not both. Dwc2 ip v3.00a
generates both SetupDone and OutDone on setup packets.
