ath10k: add 10.2.4 firmware support

10.2.4 firmware uses bitmask in wmi_resource_config to configure
10.2 firmware features like airtime fairness and rx batch mode instead
of maintaining separete bool entry. This allows new features that can be
configure during init time without breaking backward compatibility.

kvalo: use WMI op version, bump up FW API to 4 to not break older versions of
ath10k
