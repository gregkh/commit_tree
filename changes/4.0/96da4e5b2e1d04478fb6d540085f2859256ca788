ASoC: Remove codec field from snd_soc_dapm_widget

There are no more users of this field left so it can finally be removed.
New users should use snd_soc_dapm_to_codec(w->dapm);

The reason why it is removed is because it doesn't fit to well anymore in
the componentized ASoC hierarchy, where DAPM works on the snd_soc_component
level. And the alternative of snd_soc_dapm_to_codec(w->dapm) typically
generates the same amount of code, so there is really no reason to keep it.

For automatic conversion the following coccinelle semantic patch can be used:
// <smpl>
@@
struct snd_soc_dapm_widget *w;
@@
-w->codec
+snd_soc_dapm_to_codec(w->dapm)
// </smpl>
