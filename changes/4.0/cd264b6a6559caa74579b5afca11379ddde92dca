pwm: sti: Maintain a bitmap of configured devices

This patch introduces a bitmap which is used to keep track of the
pwm channels which have been configured in a pwm chip.

The method used earlier to find the number of configured channels,
was to count the pwmdevices with PWMF_REQUESTED field set
and period value configured. This was not correct and failed
when of_pwm_get()/pwm_get() and then pwm_config() was used.
