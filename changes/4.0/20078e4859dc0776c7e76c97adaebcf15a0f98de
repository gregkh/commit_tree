staging: unisys: Fix "else not useful after return" warning in virthba.c

This patch fixes a warning generated during the checkpatch script that stated
"else not useful after return".  I modified the code to return a designated
status at the end of the function, and replaced the return statement in the
"else if" to set the status accordingly.
