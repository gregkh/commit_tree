ARM: 8284/1: sa1100: clear RCSR_SMR on resume

StrongARM core uses RCSR SMR bit to tell to bootloader that it was reset
by entering the sleep mode. After we have resumed, there is little point
in having that bit enabled. Moreover, if this bit is set before reboot,
the bootloader can become confused. Thus clear the SMR bit on resume
just before clearing the scratchpad (resume address) register.
