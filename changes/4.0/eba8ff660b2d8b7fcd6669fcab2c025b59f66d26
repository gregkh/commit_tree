xprtrdma: Move credit update to RPC reply handler

Reduce work in the receive CQ handler, which can be run at hardware
interrupt level, by moving the RPC/RDMA credit update logic to the
RPC reply handler.

This has some additional benefits: More header sanity checking is
done before trusting the incoming credit value, and the receive CQ
handler no longer touches the RPC/RDMA header (the CPU stalls while
waiting for the header contents to be brought into the cache).

This further extends work begun by commit e7ce710a8802 ("xprtrdma:
Avoid deadlock when credit window is reset").
