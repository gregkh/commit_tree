drm/i915: Ensure OLS & PLR are always in sync

The aim is to replace seqno values with request structures. A step along the way
is to switch to using the PLR in preference to the OLS. That requires the PLR to
only be valid when and only when the OLS is also valid. I.e., the two must be
kept in lock step. Then, code which was using the OLS can be safely switched
over to using the PLR instead.
