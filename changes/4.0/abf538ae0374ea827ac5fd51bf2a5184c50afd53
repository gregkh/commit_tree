dmaengine: ioatdma: PQ err descriptors should callback with err results

The err completion callback is missing from the error handler. Two
reasons we never hit this. On Xeon because the hw err workaround, the
completion happens on a NULL descriptor so we don't do callback on the
PQ descriptor. On Atom we have DWBES support and thus the callback already
happened or we don't halt on error, so that was take cared of. But this code
needs to be corrected for future error handlers.
