xfs: inode unlink does not set AGI buffer type

This leads to log recovery throwing errors like:

XFS (md0): Mounting V5 Filesystem
XFS (md0): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)
XFS (md0): Unknown buffer type 0!
XFS (md0): _xfs_buf_ioapply: no ops on block 0xaea8802/0x1
ffff8800ffc53800: 58 41 47 49 .....

Which is the AGI buffer magic number.

Ensure that we set the type appropriately in both unlink list
addition and removal.
