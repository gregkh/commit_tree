ASoC: ttc-dkb: Remove unnecessary snd_soc_dapm_disable_pin() calls

The "Headset Mic 2" and the "Headset Stereophone" widget are managed by the
jack detection logic. Their will be set depending on whether something is
connected to the jack or not. There is no need to manually change the state
beforehand as it will be overwritten anyway.
