arm64: ftrace: fix ftrace_modify_graph_caller for branch replace

ftrace_enable_ftrace_graph_caller and ftrace_disable_ftrace_graph_caller
should replace B(jmp) instruction and not BL(call) instruction.

Commit 9f1ae7596aad("arm64: Correct ftrace calls to
aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm()") had a typo and used
AARCH64_INSN_BRANCH_LINK instead of AARCH64_INSN_BRANCH_NOLINK.

Either instruction will work, as the link register is saved/restored
across the branch but this better matches the intention of the code.
