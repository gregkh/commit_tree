ASoC: omap-pcm: Correct dma mask

DMA_BIT_MASK of 64 is not valid dma address mask for OMAPs, it should be
set to 32.
The 64 was introduced by commit (in 2009):
a152ff24b978 ASoC: OMAP: Make DMA 64 aligned

But the dma_mask and coherent_dma_mask can not be used to specify alignment.

Fixes: a152ff24b978 (ASoC: OMAP: Make DMA 64 aligned)
