thermal: rockchip: make temperature reporting much more accurate

In general, the kernel should report temperature readings exactly as
reported by the hardware. The cpu / gpu thermal driver works in 5 degree
increments,but we ought to do more accurate. The temperature will do
linear interpolation between the entries in the table.

Test= $md5sum /dev/zero &
$while true; do grep "" /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone[1-2]/temp;
sleep .5; done

e.g. We can get the result as follows:
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/temp:39994
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/temp:39086
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/temp:39994
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/temp:39540
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/temp:39540
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/temp:39540
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/temp:39540
    /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/temp:39994
