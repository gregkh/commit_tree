ASoC: samsung: Replace depends on REGMAP_I2C with depends on I2C

regmap is a library function that gets selected by drivers that need it. No
driver modules should depend on it, since this can create dependency loops.

E.g. if machine driver depends on REGMAP_I2C and selects the CODEC driver
and the CODEC driver selects REGMAP_I2C, then the machine driver selects by
extension one of its dependencies.

The proper way to handle this is for machine drivers to depend on the same
dependencies as the CODEC driver they select. In this case it is I2C.
