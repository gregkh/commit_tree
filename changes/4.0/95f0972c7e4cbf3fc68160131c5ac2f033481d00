pinctrl: baytrail: Clear interrupt triggering from pins that are in GPIO mode

If the pin is already configured as GPIO and it has any of the triggering
flags set, we may get spurious interrupts depending on the state of the
pin.

Prevent this by clearing the triggering flags on such pins. However, if the
pin is also configured as "direct IRQ" we leave the flags as is. Otherwise
it will prevent interrupts that are routed directly to IO-APIC.
