MIPS: asm: asmmacro: Replace "add" instructions with "addu"

The "add" instruction is actually a macro in binutils and depending on
the size of the immediate it can expand to an "addi" instruction.
However, the "addi" instruction traps on overflows which is not
something we want on address calculation.
