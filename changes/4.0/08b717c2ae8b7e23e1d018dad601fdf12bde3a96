[media] adv7180: Add fast switch support

In fast switch mode the adv7180 (and similar) can lock onto a new signal
faster when switching between different inputs. As a downside though it is
no longer able to auto-detect the incoming format.

The fast switch mode is exposed as a boolean v4l control that allows
userspace applications to either enable or disable fast switch mode.
