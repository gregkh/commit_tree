mempolicy: apply page table walker on queue_pages_range()

queue_pages_range() does page table walking in its own way now, but there
is some code duplicate.  This patch applies page table walker to reduce
lines of code.

queue_pages_range() has to do some precheck to determine whether we really
walk over the vma or just skip it.  Now we have test_walk() callback in
mm_walk for this purpose, so we can do this replacement cleanly.
queue_pages_test_walk() depends on not only the current vma but also the
previous one, so queue_pages->prev is introduced to remember it.
