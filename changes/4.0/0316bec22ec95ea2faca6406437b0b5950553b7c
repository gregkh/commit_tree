mm: slub: add kernel address sanitizer support for slub allocator

With this patch kasan will be able to catch bugs in memory allocated by
slub.  Initially all objects in newly allocated slab page, marked as
redzone.  Later, when allocation of slub object happens, requested by
caller number of bytes marked as accessible, and the rest of the object
(including slub's metadata) marked as redzone (inaccessible).

We also mark object as accessible if ksize was called for this object.
There is some places in kernel where ksize function is called to inquire
size of really allocated area.  Such callers could validly access whole
allocated memory, so it should be marked as accessible.

Code in slub.c and slab_common.c files could validly access to object's
metadata, so instrumentation for this files are disabled.
