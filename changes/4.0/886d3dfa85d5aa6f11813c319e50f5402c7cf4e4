lib/radix-tree.c: change to simpler include

The comment helpfully explains why hardirq.h is included, but since
commit 2d4b84739f0a ("hardirq: Split preempt count mask definitions")
in_interrupt() has been provided by preempt_mask.h.  Use that instead,
saving around 40 lines in the generated dependency file.
