ASoC: Samsung: add missing I2C/SPI dependencies

A few sound drivers for the samsung platforms are missing dependencies
on I2C or SPI, which can lead to build errors like

codecs/rt5631.c:1737:1: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
31_i2c_driver);

codecs/rt5631.c:1737:1: error: type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'module_i2c_driver' [-Werror=implicit-int]
codecs/rt5631.c:1737:1: warning: parameter names (without types) in function declaration
codecs/rt5631.c:1726:26: warning: 'rt5631_i2c_driver' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

I have gone through all the ones that did not already have
an I2C dependency and added the ones that I found missing,
namely arndale, odroid-x2, littlemill, bells and speyside
and this patch adds all the dependencies.
