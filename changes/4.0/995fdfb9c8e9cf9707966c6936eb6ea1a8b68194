drm/exynos: Check for NULL dereference of crtc

The commit "drm/exynos: remove exynos_plane_dpms" (d9ea6256) removed the
use of the enabled flag, which means that the code may attempt to call
win_enable on a NULL crtc. This results in the following oops on
Arndale:

This patch adds in a check to ensure exynos_crtc is not NULL before it
is dereferenced.
