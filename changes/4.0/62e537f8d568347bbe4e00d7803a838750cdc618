drm/i915: Fix frontbuffer false positve.

This return 0 without setting atomic bits on fb == crtc->cursor->fb
where causing frontbuffer false positives.

According to Daniel:

The original regression seems to have been introduced in the original
check/commit split:

    drm/i915: move check of intel_crtc_cursor_set_obj() out

Which already cause other trouble, resulting in the check getting moved in

    drm/i915: Fix not checking cursor and object sizes

The frontbuffer tracking itself only was broken when we shifted it into
the check/commit logic with:

    drm/i915: Refactor work that can sleep out of commit (v7)

v2: When putting more debug prints I notice the solution was simpler
than I thought. AMS design is solid, just this return was wrong.
Sorry for the noise.

v3: Remove the entire chunck that would probably
    be removed by gcc anyway. (by Daniel)
