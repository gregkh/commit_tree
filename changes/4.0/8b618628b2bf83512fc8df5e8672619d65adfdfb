ktime: Optimize ktime_divns for constant divisors

At least on ARM, do_div() is optimized to turn constant divisors into
an inline multiplication by the reciprocal value at compile time.
However this optimization is missed entirely whenever ktime_divns() is
used and the slow out-of-line division code is used all the time.

Let ktime_divns() use do_div() inline whenever the divisor is constant
and small enough.  This will make things like ktime_to_us() and
ktime_to_ms() much faster.
