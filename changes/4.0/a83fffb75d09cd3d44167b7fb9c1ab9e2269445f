btrfs: sink blocksize parameter to btrfs_find_create_tree_block

Finally it's clear that the requested blocksize is always equal to
nodesize, with one exception, the superblock.

Superblock has fixed size regardless of the metadata block size, but
uses the same helpers to initialize sys array/chunk tree and to work
with the chunk items. So it pretends to be an extent_buffer for a
moment, btrfs_read_sys_array is full of special cases, we're adding one
more.
