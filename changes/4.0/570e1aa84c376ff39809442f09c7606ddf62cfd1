x86/mm/ASLR: Avoid PAGE_SIZE redefinition for UML subarch

Commit f47233c2d34 ("x86/mm/ASLR: Propagate base load address
calculation") causes PAGE_SIZE redefinition warnings for UML
subarch  builds. This is caused by added includes that were
leftovers from previous  patch versions are are not actually
needed (especially page_types.h  inlcude in module.c). Drop
those stray includes.
