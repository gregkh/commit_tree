hpsa: move SG descriptor set-up out of hpsa_scatter_gather()

Move the code which sets up the SG descriptor out of hpsa_scatter_gather()
and into a subroutine where it can be reused (in the next patch).  The Ext
field is now assigned unconditionally: this makes the refactor much simpler,
but more importantly it removes a conditional operation from inside the
loop.  The case for which the conditional formerly tested is now executed
(unconditionally) after the loop is exited.
