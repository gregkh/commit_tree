net: ethernet: pcnet32: Setup the SRAM and NOUFLO on Am79C97{3, 5}

On a MIPS Malta board, tons of fifo underflow errors have been observed
when using u-boot as bootloader instead of YAMON. The reason for that
is that YAMON used to set the pcnet device to SRAM mode but u-boot does
not. As a result, the default Tx threshold (64 bytes) is now too small to
keep the fifo relatively used and it can result to Tx fifo underflow errors.
As a result of which, it's best to setup the SRAM on supported controllers
so we can always use the NOUFLO bit.
