parport: parport_atari: Remove obsolete IRQ_TYPE_SLOW

IRQ_TYPE_SLOW is no longer used by the Atari platform interrupt code
since commit 734085651c9b80aa ("[PATCH] m68k: convert atari irq code")
in v2.6.18-rc1, so drop it.

Note that its value has been reused for a different purpose
(IRQ_TYPE_NONE) since commit 6a6de9ef5850d063 ("[PATCH] genirq: core")
in v2.6.18-rc1.
