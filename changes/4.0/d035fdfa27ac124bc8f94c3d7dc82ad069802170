arm64: Add Tegra132 support

Add basic Kbuild support for the Tegra SoC family, and specifically,
the Tegra132 SoC.  Tegra132 pairs the NVIDIA Denver CPU complex with
the SoC integration of Tegra124 - hence the use of ARCH_TEGRA and the
Tegra124 pinctrl option.

This patch was based on a patch originally written by Allen Martin
