ACPICA: Events: Cleanup GPE dispatcher type obtaining code

ACPICA commit 7926d5ca9452c87f866938dcea8f12e1efb58f89

There is an issue in acpi_install_gpe_handler() and acpi_remove_gpe_handler().
The code to obtain the GPE dispatcher type from the Handler->original_flags
is wrong:
    if (((Handler->original_flags & ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_METHOD) ||
         (Handler->original_flags & ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_NOTIFY)) &&
ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_NOTIFY is 0x03 and ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_METHOD is 0x02, thus
this statement is TRUE for the following dispatcher types:
    0x01 (ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_HANDLER): not expected
    0x02 (ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_METHOD): expected
    0x03 (ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_NOTIFY): expected

There is no functional issue due to this because Handler->original_flags is
only set in acpi_install_gpe_handler(), and an earlier checker has excluded
the ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_HANDLER:
    if ((gpe_event_info->Flags & ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_MASK) ==
            ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_HANDLER)
    {
        Status = AE_ALREADY_EXISTS;
        goto free_and_exit;
    }
    ...
    Handler->original_flags = (u8) (gpe_event_info->Flags &
        (ACPI_GPE_XRUPT_TYPE_MASK | ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_MASK));

We need to clean this up before modifying the GPE dispatcher type values.

In order to prevent such issue from happening in the future, this patch
introduces ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_TYPE() macro to be used to obtain the GPE
dispatcher types. Lv Zheng.
