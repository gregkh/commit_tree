Bluetooth: Support static address when BR/EDR has been disabled

Every BR/EDR/LE dual-mode controller requires to have a public address
and so far that has become the identity address and own address. The
only way to change that behavior was with a force_static_address
debugfs option.

However the host can actually disable the BR/EDR part of a dual-mode
controller and turn into a single mode LE controller. In that case
it makes perfect sense for a host to use a chosen static address
instead of the public address.

So if the host disables BR/EDR and configures a static address, then
that static address is used as identity address and own address. If
the host does not configure a static address, then the public address
is used as before.
