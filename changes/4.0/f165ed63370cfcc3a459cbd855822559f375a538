spi: img-spfi: Verify max spfi transfer length

Maximum transfer length supported by SPFI is 65535, this is limited
by the number of bits available in SPFI TSize register to represent
the transfer size.
For transfer requests larger than the maximum supported the driver
will return an invalid argument error.
