tracing: Separate out initializing top level dir from instances

The top level trace array is treated a little different than the
instances, as it has to deal with more of the general tracing.
The tr->dir is the tracing directory, which is an immutable
dentry, where as the tr->dir of instances are the dentry that
was created, and can be destroyed later. These should have different
functions accessing them.

As only tracing_init_dentry() deals with the top level array, fold
the code for it into that function, and remove the trace_init_dentry_tr()
that was also used by the instances to get their directory dentry.

Add a tracing_get_dentry() to just get the tracing dir entry for
instances as well as the top level array.
