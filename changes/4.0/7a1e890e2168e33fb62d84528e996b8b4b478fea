usbnet: Fix tx_bytes statistic running backward in cdc_ncm

cdc_ncm disagrees with usbnet about how much framing overhead should
be counted in the tx_bytes statistics, and tries 'fix' this by
decrementing tx_bytes on the transmit path.  But statistics must never
be decremented except due to roll-over; this will thoroughly confuse
user-space.  Also, tx_bytes is only incremented by usbnet in the
completion path.

Fix this by requiring drivers that set FLAG_MULTI_FRAME to set a
tx_bytes delta along with the tx_packets count.
