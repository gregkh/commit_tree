fs: introduce f_op->mmap_capabilities for nommu mmap support

Since "BDI: Provide backing device capability information [try #3]" the
backing_dev_info structure also provides flags for the kind of mmap
operation available in a nommu environment, which is entirely unrelated
to it's original purpose.

Introduce a new nommu-only file operation to provide this information to
the nommu mmap code instead.  Splitting this from the backing_dev_info
structure allows to remove lots of backing_dev_info instance that aren't
otherwise needed, and entirely gets rid of the concept of providing a
backing_dev_info for a character device.  It also removes the need for
the mtd_inodefs filesystem.
