drivers: char: mem: Simplify DEVPORT configuration

Simplify the use of CONFIG_DEVPORT by making the port_fops
so that it includes __maybe_unused.

This enabled the multiple #ifdef's used for this structure
to be removed and brings it in line with the use of CONFIG_DEVMEM

This change should introduce no functional changes.
