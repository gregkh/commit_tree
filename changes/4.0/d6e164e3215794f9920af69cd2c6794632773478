tipc: fix socket list regression in new nl api

Commit 07f6c4bc (tipc: convert tipc reference table to use generic
rhashtable) introduced a problem with port listing in the new netlink
API. It broke the resume functionality resulting in a never ending
loop. This was caused by starting with the first hash table every time
subsequently never returning an empty skb (terminating).

This patch fixes the resume mechanism by keeping a logical reference
to the last hash table along with a logical reference to the socket
(port) that didn't fit in the previous message.
