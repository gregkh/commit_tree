rhashtable: don't test for shrink on insert, expansion on delete

Restore pre 54c5b7d311c8 behaviour and only probe for expansions on inserts
and shrinks on deletes. Currently, it will happen that on initial inserts
into a sparse hash table, we may i.e. shrink it first simply because it's
not fully populated yet, only to later realize that we need to grow again.

This however is counter intuitive, e.g. an initial default size of 64
elements is already small enough, and in case an elements size hint is given
to the hash table by a user, we should avoid unnecessary expansion steps,
so a shrink is clearly unintended here.
