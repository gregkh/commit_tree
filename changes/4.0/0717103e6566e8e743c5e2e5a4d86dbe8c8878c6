ARM: DRA7: hwmod_data: Fix hwmod data for pcie

Fixed hwmod data for pcie by having the correct module mode offset.
Previously this module mode offset was part of pcie PHY which was wrong.
Now this module mode offset was moved to pcie hwmod and removed the hwmod data
for pcie phy. While at that renamed pcie_hwmod to pciess_hwmod in order
to match with the name given in TRM.

This helps to get rid of the following warning
"omap_hwmod: pcie1: _wait_target_disable failed"

[Grygorii.Strashko@linaro.org: Found the issue that actually caused
 "omap_hwmod: pcie1: _wait_target_disable failed"]
