openvswitch: Fix serialization of non-masked set actions.

Set actions consist of a regular OVS_KEY_ATTR_* attribute nested inside
of a OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SET action attribute. When converting masked actions
back to regular set actions, the inner attribute length was not changed,
ie, double the length being serialized. This patch fixes the bug.
