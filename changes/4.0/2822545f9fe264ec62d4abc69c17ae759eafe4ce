KVM: s390: new parameter for SIGP STOP irqs

In order to get rid of the action_flags and to properly migrate pending SIGP
STOP irqs triggered e.g. by SIGP STOP AND STORE STATUS, we need to remember
whether to store the status when stopping.

For this reason, a new parameter (flags) for the SIGP STOP irq is introduced.
These flags further define details of the requested STOP and can be easily
migrated.
