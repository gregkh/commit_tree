xen-netback: use foreign page information from the pages themselves

Use the foreign page flag in netback to get the domid and grant ref
needed for the grant copy.  This signficiantly simplifies the netback
code and makes netback work with foreign pages from other backends
(e.g., blkback).

This allows blkback to use iSCSI disks provided by domUs running on
the same host.
