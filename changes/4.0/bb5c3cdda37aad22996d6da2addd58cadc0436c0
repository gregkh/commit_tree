block: Remove annoying "unknown partition table" message

As Christoph put it:
  Can we just get rid of the warnings?  It's fairly annoying as devices
  without partitions are perfectly fine and very useful.

Me too I see this message every VM boot for ages on all my
devices. Would love to just remove it. For me a partition-table
is only needed for a booting BIOS, grub, and stuff.
