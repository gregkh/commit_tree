drm/i915: Convert __wait_seqno() to __wait_request()

Now that all code above is using request structures instead of seqno values, it
is possible to convert  __wait_seqno() itself. Internally, it is still calling
i915_seqno_passed(), this will be updated later in the series. This step is just
changing the parameter list and function name.
