KVM: s390: move vcpu specific initalization to a later point

As we will allow in a later patch to recreate gmaps with new limits,
we need to make sure that vcpus get their reference for that gmap
after they increased the online_vcpu counter, so there is no possible race.

While we are doing this, we also can simplify the vcpu_init function, by
moving ucontrol specifics to an own function.
That way we also start now setting the kvm_valid_regs for the ucontrol path.
