power/reset: at91-poweroff: Fix error handling and other compiler warnings

at91_poweroff_get_wakeup_mode can return a negative error code and should
therefore not return an enum type. Similar, its result should not be
assigned to an enum type. Otherwise, the returned value is never negative,
resulting in a compiler warning and a missed error condition, which in turn
results in writing bad values into a chip register.

Also fix other compiler warnings which can be easily avoided.
