crypto: arm/aes update NEON AES module to latest OpenSSL version

This updates the bit sliced AES module to the latest version in the
upstream OpenSSL repository (e620e5ae37bc). This is needed to fix a
bug in the XTS decryption path, where data chunked in a certain way
could trigger the ciphertext stealing code, which is not supposed to
be active in the kernel build (The kernel implementation of XTS only
supports round multiples of the AES block size of 16 bytes, whereas
the conformant OpenSSL implementation of XTS supports inputs of
arbitrary size by applying ciphertext stealing). This is fixed in
the upstream version by adding the missing #ifndef XTS_CHAIN_TWEAK
around the offending instructions.

The upstream code also contains the change applied by Russell to
build the code unconditionally, i.e., even if __LINUX_ARM_ARCH__ < 7,
but implemented slightly differently.
