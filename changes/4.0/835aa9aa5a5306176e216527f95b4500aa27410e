staging: comedi: pcl730: rewrite "Devices:" line

Rewrite the "Devices:" line in the comedi "driver" comment to conform to
the usual comedi format for this line.  The line should be a
comma-separated list where the first item is in the following format:

  [Manufacturer] BOARD-NAME (comedi-board-name)

The "[Manufacturer]" and/or "(comedi-board-name)" parts may be omitted
from following items, in which case the parts from the preceding item
are used.  The "Devices:" line may be continued continued over several
lines by using one or more spaces at the start of each continuation line
(not counting the space after the "*" in the block comment).

Group boards from the same manufacturer together on the "Devices:" line
to avoid repeating the "[Manufacturer]" tag unnecessarily.

Also fix a couple of typos in the board names on the "Devices:" line:
"p16r16dio" was used twice, but one of them should be "p8r8dio";
"prearl-mm-p" should be "pearl-mm-p".
