HID: tivo: enable all buttons on the TiVo Slide Pro remote

The linux kernel has supported the TiVo Slide remote control for some time, but
does not recognize the USB ID of the newer Slide Pro. This patch adds the
missing data structures so the newer remote will be recognized by the driver,
thereby allowing the TiVo, LiveTV, and Thumbs Up/Down buttons to be
mapped with a hwdb file.
