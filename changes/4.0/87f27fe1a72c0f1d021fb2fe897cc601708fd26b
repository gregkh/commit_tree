sh-pfc: r8a7791: fix typo in MLB_CLK

The R8A7791 manual sometimes calls the signal MLB_CLK and sometimes MLB_CK; the
latter can only be encountered in the PFC section and  is probably  just a typo
(this  signal is always called MLB_CLK in the R8A7790  manual). Fix occurences
of MLB_CK throughout the R8A7791 PFC driver.
