rhashtable: Supports for nulls marker

In order to allow for wider usage of rhashtable, use a special nulls
marker to terminate each chain. The reason for not using the existing
nulls_list is that the prev pointer usage would not be valid as entries
can be linked in two different buckets at the same time.

The 4 nulls base bits can be set through the rhashtable_params structure
like this:

struct rhashtable_params params = {
        [...]
        .nulls_base = (1U << RHT_BASE_SHIFT),
};

This reduces the hash length from 32 bits to 27 bits.
