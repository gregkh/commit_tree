tty: Remove external interface for tty_set_termios()

tty_set_termios() is an internal helper intended for file scope use.

UART drivers which are capable of driving the RTS pin must
properly handle the tiocmset() method, regardless of termios settings.
A failure to do so is a UART driver bug and should be fixed there.
Do not use this interface to workaround UART driver bugs.
