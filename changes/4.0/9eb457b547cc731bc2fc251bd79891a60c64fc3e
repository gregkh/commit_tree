pinctrl: cherryview: Save and restore pin configs over system sleep

Before resuming from system sleep BIOS restores its view of pin
configuration. If we have configured some pins differently from that, for
instance some driver requested a pin as a GPIO but it was not in GPIO mode
originally, our view of the pin configuration will not match the hardware
state anymore.

This patch saves the pin configuration and interrupt mask registers on
suspend and restores them on exit. This should make sure that the
previously configured state is still in effect.
