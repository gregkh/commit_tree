fib_trie: Remove checks for index >= tnode_child_length from tnode_get_child

For some reason the compiler doesn't seem to understand that when we are in
a loop that runs from tnode_child_length - 1 to 0 we don't expect the value
of tn->bits to change.  As such every call to tnode_get_child was rerunning
tnode_chile_length which ended up consuming quite a bit of space in the
resultant assembly code.

I have gone though and verified that in all cases where tnode_get_child
is used we are either winding though a fixed loop from tnode_child_length -
1 to 0, or are in a fastpath case where we are verifying the value by
either checking for any remaining bits after shifting index by bits and
testing for leaf, or by using tnode_child_length.
