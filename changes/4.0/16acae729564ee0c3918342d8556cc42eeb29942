irqchip: gicv3-its: Fix ITS CPU init

We skip initialisation of ITS in case the device-tree has no
corresponding description, but we are still accessing to ITS bits while
setting CPU interface what leads to the kernel panic:

ITS: No ITS available, not enabling LPIs
CPU0: found redistributor 0 region 0:0x000000002f100000
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
pgd = ffffffc0007fb000

It happens in gic_rdists_supports_plpis() because gic_rdists is NULL.
The gic_rdists is set to non-NULL only when ITS node is presented in
the device-tree.

Fix this by moving the call to gic_rdists_supports_plpis() inside the
!list_empty(&its_nodes) block, because it is that list that guards the
validity of the rest of the information in this driver.
