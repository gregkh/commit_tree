NFS: Fix stateid used for NFS v4 closes

After 566fcec60 the client uses the "current stateid" from the
nfs4_state structure to close a file.  This could potentially contain a
delegation stateid, which is disallowed by the protocol and causes
servers to return NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID.  This patch restores the
(correct) behavior of sending the open stateid to close a file.
