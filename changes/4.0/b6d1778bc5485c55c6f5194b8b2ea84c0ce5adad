dmaengine: shdma: Move DMA stop to (runtime) suspend callbacks

During system reboot, the sh-dma-engine device may be runtime-suspended,
causing a crash:

    Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0002c02c
    Internal error: : 1406 [#1] SMP ARM
    ...
    PC is at sh_dmae_ctl_stop+0x28/0x64
    LR is at sh_dmae_ctl_stop+0x24/0x64

If the sh-dma-engine is runtime-suspended, its module clock is turned
off, and its registers cannot be accessed.

To fix this, move the call to sh_dmae_ctl_stop(), which touches the
DMAOR register, to the sh_dmae_suspend() and sh_dmae_runtime_suspend()
callbacks.  This makes PM operations more symmetric, as both
sh_dmae_resume() and sh_dmae_runtime_resume() already call sh_dmae_rst()
to re-initialize the DMAOR register.

Remove sh_dmae_shutdown(), as it became empty.
