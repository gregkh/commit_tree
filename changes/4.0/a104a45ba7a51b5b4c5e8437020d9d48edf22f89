dmaengine: dw: append MODULE_ALIAS for platform driver

The commit 9cade1a46c77 (dma: dw: split driver to library part and platform
code) introduced a separate platform driver but missed to add a
MODULE_ALIAS("platform:dw_dmac"); to that module.

The patch adds this to get driver loaded automatically if platform device is
registered.
