cpufreq: exynos: Use simple approach to asses if cpu cooling can be used

Commit: e725d26c4857e5e41975b5e74e64ce6ab09a7121 provided possibility to
use device tree to asses if cpu can be used as cooling device. Since the
code was somewhat awkward, simpler approach has been proposed.

Test HW: Exynos 4412 - Odroid U3.
