ARM: 8285/1: remove ARMv3 user access code again

This code was restored with commit 080fc66fb5 ("ARM: Bring back ARMv3 IO
and user access code") because the RiscPC memory bus does not understand
half-word load/stores.  However only the IO code needed restoring since
the alternative user access code contains no half-word accesses, is
already used when CONFIG_PREEMPT is set and runs faster on a StrongARM.
