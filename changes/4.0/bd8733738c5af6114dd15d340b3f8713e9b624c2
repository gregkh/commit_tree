pinctrl: at91: move lock/unlock_as_irq calls into request/release

The gpiochip_lock_as_irq call can fail and return an error,
while the irq_startup is not expected to fail (returns an
unsigned int which is not checked by irq core code).

irq_request/release_resources functions have been created
to address this problem.

Move gpiochip_lock/unlock_as_irq calls into
irq_request/release_resources functions to prevent using a
gpio as an irq if the gpiochip_lock_as_irq call failed.
