uprobes/x86: Add comment with insn opcodes, mnemonics and why we dont support them

After adding these, it's clear we have some awkward choices
there. Some valid instructions are prohibited from uprobing
while several invalid ones are allowed.

Hopefully future edits to the good-opcode tables will fix wrong
bits or explain why those bits are not wrong.

No actual code changes.
