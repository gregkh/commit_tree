NFC: nci: Add NFCEE discover support

NFCEEs (NFC Execution Environment) have to be explicitly
discovered by sending the NCI_OP_NFCEE_DISCOVER_CMD
command. The NFCC will respond to this command by telling
us how many NFCEEs are connected to it. Then the NFCC sends
a notification command for each and every NFCEE connected.
Here we implement support for sending
NCI_OP_NFCEE_DISCOVER_CMD command, receiving the response
and the potential notifications.
