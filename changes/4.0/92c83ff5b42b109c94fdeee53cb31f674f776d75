cpuidle: powernv: Read target_residency value of idle states from DT if available

The device tree now exposes the residency values for different idle states. Read
these values instead of calculating residency from the latency values. The values
exposed in the DT are validated for optimal power efficiency. However to maintain
compatibility with the older firmware code which does not expose residency
values, use default values as a fallback mechanism. While at it, use better
APIs to parse the powermgmt device tree node.
