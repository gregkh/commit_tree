net: smc91x: use run-time configuration on all ARM machines

The smc91x driver traditionally gets configured at compile-time
for whichever hardware it runs on. This no longer works on
ARM as we continue to move to building all-in-one kernels.

Most ARM configurations with this driver already use run-time
configuration through DT or through platform_data, but a
few have not been converted yet.

I've checked all ARM boards that use this driver in their
legacy board files, and converted the ones that were using
compile-time configuration in smc91x.h to behave like the
other ones and provide the interrupt polarity along with
the MMIO configuration (width, stride) at platform device
creation time.

In particular, these combinations were previously selectable
in Kconfig but in fact broken:

- sa1100 assabet plus pleb
- msm combined with any other armv6/v7 platform
- pxa-idp combined with any non-DMA pxa variant
- LogicPD PXA270 combined with any other pxa
- nomadik combined with any other armv4/v5 platform,
  e.g. versatile.

None of these seem critical enough to warrant a backport
to stable, but it would be nice to clean this up for good.

I would like the patch to get merged through netdev, after
Robert and/or Linus have verified it on at least some hardware.

There are a few other non-ARM platforms using this driver,
I could do the same patch for those if we want to take
it further.
