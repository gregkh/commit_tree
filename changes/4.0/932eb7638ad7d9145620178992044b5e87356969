tcp: use SACK RTTs for CC

Current behavior only passes RTTs from sequentially acked data to CC.

If sender gets a combined ACK for segment 1 and SACK for segment 3, then the
computed RTT for CC is the time between sending segment 1 and receiving SACK
for segment 3.

Pass the minimum computed RTT from any acked data to CC, i.e. time between
sending segment 3 and receiving SACK for segment 3.
