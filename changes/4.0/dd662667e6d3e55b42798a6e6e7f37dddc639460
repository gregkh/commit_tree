ovl: add mutli-layer infrastructure

Add multiple lower layers to 'struct ovl_fs' and 'struct ovl_entry'.

ovl_entry will have an array of paths, instead of just the dentry.  This
allows a compact array containing just the layers which exist at current
point in the tree (which is expected to be a small number for the majority
of dentries).

The number of layers is not limited by this infrastructure.
