mmc: dw_mmc: fix the max_blk_count in IDMAC

Even though 1MB is reserved for descriptor table in IDMAC,
the dw_mmc host driver is allowed to receive only maximum
128KB block length in one request. This is caused by setting
improper max_blk_count. It needs to be e adjusted so that
descriptor table is used fully. It is found that the performance
is improved with the increased the max_blk_count.
