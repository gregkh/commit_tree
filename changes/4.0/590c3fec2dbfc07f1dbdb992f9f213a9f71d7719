IB/qib: Replace rcu_assign_pointer() with RCU_INIT_POINTER() in qib_keys.c

The uses of "rcu_assign_pointer()" are NULLing out the pointers.
According to RCU_INIT_POINTER()'s block comment:
"1.   This use of RCU_INIT_POINTER() is NULLing out the pointer"
it is better to use it instead of rcu_assign_pointer() because it has a
smaller overhead.

The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used:

- rcu_assign_pointer
+ RCU_INIT_POINTER
  (..., NULL)
