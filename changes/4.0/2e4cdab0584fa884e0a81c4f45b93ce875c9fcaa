mm: allow page fault handlers to perform the COW

Currently COW of an XIP file is done by first bringing in a read-only
mapping, then retrying the fault and copying the page.  It is much more
efficient to tell the fault handler that a COW is being attempted (by
passing in the pre-allocated page in the vm_fault structure), and allow
the handler to perform the COW operation itself.

The handler cannot insert the page itself if there is already a read-only
mapping at that address, so allow the handler to return VM_FAULT_LOCKED
and set the fault_page to be NULL.  This indicates to the MM code that the
i_mmap_lock is held instead of the page lock.
