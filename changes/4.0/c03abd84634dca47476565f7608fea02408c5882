net: ethernet: cpsw: don't requests IRQs we don't use

CPSW never uses RX_THRESHOLD or MISC interrupts. In
fact, they are always kept masked in their appropriate
IRQ Enable register.

Instead of allocating an IRQ that never fires, it's best
to remove that code altogether and let future patches
implement it if anybody needs those.
