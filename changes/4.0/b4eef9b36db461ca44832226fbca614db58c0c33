kvm: x86: vmx: NULL out hwapic_isr_update() in case of !enable_apicv

In most cases calling hwapic_isr_update(), we always check if
kvm_apic_vid_enabled() == 1, but actually,
kvm_apic_vid_enabled()
    -> kvm_x86_ops->vm_has_apicv()
        -> vmx_vm_has_apicv() or '0' in svm case
            -> return enable_apicv && irqchip_in_kernel(kvm)

So its a little cost to recall vmx_vm_has_apicv() inside
hwapic_isr_update(), here just NULL out hwapic_isr_update() in
case of !enable_apicv inside hardware_setup() then make all
related stuffs follow this. Note we don't check this under that
condition of irqchip_in_kernel() since we should make sure
definitely any caller don't work  without in-kernel irqchip.
