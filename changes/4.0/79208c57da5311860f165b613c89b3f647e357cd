Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: Make adjustments in computing the floor

Make adjustments in computing the balloon floor. The current computation
of the balloon floor was not appropriate for virtual machines with more than
10 GB of assigned memory - we would get into situations where the host would
agressively balloon down the guest and leave the guest in an unusable state.
This patch fixes the issue by raising the floor.
