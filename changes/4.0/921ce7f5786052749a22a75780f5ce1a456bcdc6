ses: add reliable slot attribute

The name provided by firmware is in a vendor specific format, publish
the slot number to have a reliable mechanism for identifying slots
across firmware implementations.  If the enclosure does not provide a
slot number fallback to the component number which is guaranteed unique,
and usually mirrors the slot number.

Cleaned up the unused ses_component.desc in the process.
