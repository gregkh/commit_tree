USB: fix use-after-free bug in usb_hcd_unlink_urb()

The usb_hcd_unlink_urb() routine in hcd.c contains two possible
use-after-free errors.  The dev_dbg() statement at the end of the
routine dereferences urb and urb->dev even though both structures may
have been deallocated.

This patch fixes the problem by storing urb->dev in a local variable
(avoiding the dereference of urb) and moving the dev_dbg() up before
the usb_put_dev() call.
