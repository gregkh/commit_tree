Input: cyapa - fix endianness issues in gen5 firmware update support

gen5_bl_metadata_row_params structure has its fields specified with
explicit endianness, so we should not be trying to convert to native CPU
endianness when filling the structure.

Also fix firmware validation checks and misspelled field in
gen5_bl_metadata_row_params.
