livepatch: support for repatching a function

Add support for patching a function multiple times.  If multiple patches
affect a function, the function in the most recently enabled patch
"wins".  This enables a cumulative patch upgrade path, where each patch
is a superset of previous patches.

This requires restructuring the data a little bit.  With the current
design, where each klp_func struct has its own ftrace_ops, we'd have to
unregister the old ops and then register the new ops, because
FTRACE_OPS_FL_IPMODIFY prevents us from having two ops registered for
the same function at the same time.  That would leave a regression
window where the function isn't patched at all (not good for a patch
upgrade path).

This patch replaces the per-klp_func ftrace_ops with a global klp_ops
list, with one ftrace_ops per original function.  A single ftrace_ops is
shared between all klp_funcs which have the same old_addr.  This allows
the switch between function versions to happen instantaneously by
updating the klp_ops struct's func_stack list.  The winner is the
klp_func at the top of the func_stack (front of the list).
