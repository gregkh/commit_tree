spi: dw: revisit FIFO size detection again

The commit d297933cc7fc (spi: dw: Fix detecting FIFO depth) tries to fix the
logic of the FIFO detection based on the description on the comments. However,
there is a slight difference between numbers in TX Level and TX FIFO size.

So, by specification the FIFO size would be in a range 2-256 bytes. From TX
Level prospective it means we can set threshold in the range 0-(FIFO size - 1)
bytes. Hence there are currently two issues:
  a) FIFO size 2 bytes is actually skipped since TX Level is 1 bit and could be
     either 0 or 1 byte;
  b) FIFO size is incorrectly decreased by 1 which already done by meaning of
     TX Level register.

This patch fixes it eventually right.
