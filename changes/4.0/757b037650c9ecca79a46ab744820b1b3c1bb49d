ALSA: pcm: Replace custom ld2 function with __fls

__fls has the same semantics as ld2, so there is no need to re-implement it.
Furthermore a lot of architectures have custom implementations of __fls that
are able to use special hardware instructions to compute the result. This
makes the code slightly shorter and faster.
