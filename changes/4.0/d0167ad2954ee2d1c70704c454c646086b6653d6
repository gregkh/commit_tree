Revert "xhci: Clear the host side toggle manually when endpoint is 'soft reset'"

This reverts commit 27082e2654dc ("xhci: Clear the host side toggle manually")

Turns out this fix to enable soft resetting endpoints wasn't mature enough.
It caused regression with some usb DVB-T devices and needs some more tuning
to get the endpiont ring pointers set correctly.

The original commit was tagged for stable 3.18, and should be reverted
from there as well.
