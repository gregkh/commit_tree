KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: add init entry to VGIC KVM device

Since the advent of VGIC dynamic initialization, this latter is
initialized quite late on the first vcpu run or "on-demand", when
injecting an IRQ or when the guest sets its registers.

This initialization could be initiated explicitly much earlier
by the users-space, as soon as it has provided the requested
dimensioning parameters.

This patch adds a new entry to the VGIC KVM device that allows
the user to manually request the VGIC init:
- a new KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_CTRL group is introduced.
- Its first attribute is KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT

The rationale behind introducing a group is to be able to add other
controls later on, if needed.
