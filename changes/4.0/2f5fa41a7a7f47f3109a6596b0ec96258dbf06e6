arm/arm64: KVM: make the value of ICC_SRE_EL1 a per-VM variable

ICC_SRE_EL1 is a system register allowing msr/mrs accesses to the
GIC CPU interface for EL1 (guests). Currently we force it to 0, but
for proper GICv3 support we have to allow guests to use it (depending
on their selected virtual GIC model).
So add ICC_SRE_EL1 to the list of saved/restored registers on a
world switch, but actually disallow a guest to change it by only
restoring a fixed, once-initialized value.
This value depends on the GIC model userland has chosen for a guest.
