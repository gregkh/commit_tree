net: fib6: fib6_commit_metrics: fix potential NULL pointer dereference

When IPv6 host routes with metrics attached are being added, we fetch
the metrics store from the dst via COW through dst_metrics_write_ptr(),
added through commit e5fd387ad5b3.

One remaining problem here is that we actually call into inet_getpeer()
and may end up allocating/creating a new peer from the kmemcache, which
may fail.

Example trace from perf probe (inet_getpeer:41) where create is 1:

ip 6877 [002] 4221.391591: probe:inet_getpeer: (ffffffff8165e293)
  85e294 inet_getpeer.part.7 (<- kmem_cache_alloc())
  85e578 inet_getpeer
  8eb333 ipv6_cow_metrics
  8f10ff fib6_commit_metrics

Therefore, a check for NULL on the return of dst_metrics_write_ptr()
is necessary here.

Joint work with Florian Westphal.
