crypto: fix af_alg_make_sg() conversion to iov_iter

Commit 1d10eb2f156f ("crypto: switch af_alg_make_sg() to iov_iter")
broke af_alg_make_sg() and skcipher_recvmsg() in the process of moving
them to the iov_iter interfaces.  The 'npages' calculation in the formar
calculated the number of *bytes* in the pages, and in the latter case
the conversion didn't re-read the value of 'ctx->used' after waiting for
it to become non-zero.

This reverts to the original code for both these cases.
