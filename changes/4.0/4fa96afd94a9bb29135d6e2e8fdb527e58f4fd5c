arm/arm64: KVM: force alignment of VGIC dist/CPU/redist addresses

Although the GIC architecture requires us to map the MMIO regions
only at page aligned addresses, we currently do not enforce this from
the kernel side.
Restrict any vGICv2 regions to be 4K aligned and any GICv3 regions
to be 64K aligned. Document this requirement.
