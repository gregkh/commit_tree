mac80211: remove local->radar_detect_enabled

local->radar_detect_enabled should tell whether
radar_detect is enabled on any interface belonging
to local.

However, it's not getting updated correctly
in many cases (actually, when testing with hwsim
it's never been set, even when the dfs master
is beaconing).

Instead of handling all the corner cases
(e.g. channel switch), simply check whether
radar detection is enabled only when needed,
instead of caching the result.
