s390/topology: convert cpu_topology array to per cpu variable

Convert the per cpu topology cpu masks to a per cpu variable.
At least for machines which do have less possible cpus than NR_CPUS this can
save a bit of memory (z/VM: max 64 vs 512 for performance_defconfig).

This reduces the kernel image size by 100k.
