mm: memcontrol: simplify soft limit tree init code

- No need to test the node for N_MEMORY.  node_online() is enough for
  node fallback to work in slab, use NUMA_NO_NODE for everything else.

- Remove the BUG_ON() for allocation failure.  A NULL pointer crash is
  just as descriptive, and the absent return value check is obvious.

- Move local variables to the inner-most blocks.

- Point to the tree structure after its initialized, not before, it's
  just more logical that way.
