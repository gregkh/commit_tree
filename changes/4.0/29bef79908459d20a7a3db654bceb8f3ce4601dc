serial: samsung: add DMA support for TX

Add TX DMA transfers support for samsung serial driver. It's enabled
when "dmas" property is defined in serial device-tree node, otherwise
TX transfers are prerformed using PIO.

TX DMA is used for data segments larger than fifosize to reduce number
of interrupts during data transmission. For buffers shorter than fifosize
PIO mode is selected.

Data blocks for DMA transfers are aligned to cache line size to avoid
problems with coherency (some areas of TX circ buffer can be used by
CPU during DMA transaction, so we have to ensure that our data is always
consistent).

Based on previous work of Sylwester Nawrocki and Lukasz Czerwinski.
