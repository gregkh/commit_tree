dts: versatile: Add sysregs node

The Versatile boards have the same sysregs as other ARM Ltd boards. Add
the nodes in order to enable support for 24MHz counter as sched_clock.

This is a minimal node definition as the existing sub node definition
used on VExpress has some issues raised by Linus W.
