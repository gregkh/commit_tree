ath: ath9k: use debugfs_create_devm_seqfile() helper for seq_file entries

Use the helper to get rid of the file operations per debugfs file. The
device driver data contains struct ieee80211_hw pointer and the
struct ath9k_softc pointer is assigned to ieee80211_hw::priv so it can
be accessed in the seq_file read operation.
