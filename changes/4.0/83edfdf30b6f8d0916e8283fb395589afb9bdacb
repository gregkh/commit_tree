Input: ti_am335x_tsc - replace delta filtering with median filtering

Previously, delta filtering was applied TSC co-ordinate readouts before
reporting a single value to user space. This patch replaces delta filtering
with median filtering. Median filtering sorts co-ordinate readouts, drops
min and max values, and reports the average of remaining values. This
method is more sensible than delta filtering. Median filtering is applied
only if number of readouts is greater than 3 else just average of
co-ordinate readouts is reported.
