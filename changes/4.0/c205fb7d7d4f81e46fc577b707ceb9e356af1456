KVM: x86: #PF error-code on R/W operations is wrong

When emulating an instruction that reads the destination memory operand (i.e.,
instructions without the Mov flag in the emulator), the operand is first read.
If a page-fault is detected in this phase, the error-code which would be
delivered to the VM does not indicate that the access that caused the exception
is a write one. This does not conform with real hardware, and may cause the VM
to enter the page-fault handler twice for no reason (once for read, once for
write).
