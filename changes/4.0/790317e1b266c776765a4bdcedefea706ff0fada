cpuset: initialize effective masks when clone_children is enabled

If clone_children is enabled, effective masks won't be initialized
due to the bug:

  # mount -t cgroup -o cpuset xxx /mnt
  # echo 1 > cgroup.clone_children
  # mkdir /mnt/tmp
  # cat /mnt/tmp/
  # cat cpuset.effective_cpus

  # cat cpuset.cpus
  0-15

And then this cpuset won't constrain the tasks in it.

Either the bug or the fix has no effect on unified hierarchy, as
there's no clone_chidren flag there any more.
