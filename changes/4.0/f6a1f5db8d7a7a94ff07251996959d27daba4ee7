lib/bitmap.c: simplify bitmap_ord_to_pos

Make the return value and the ord and nbits parameters of
bitmap_ord_to_pos unsigned.

Also, simplify the implementation and as a side effect make the result
fully defined, returning nbits for ord >= weight, in analogy with what
find_{first,next}_bit does.  This is a better sentinel than the former
("unofficial") 0.  No current users are affected by this change.
