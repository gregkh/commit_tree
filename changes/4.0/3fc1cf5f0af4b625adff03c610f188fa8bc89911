mtd: physmap_of: Add read-only fallback

Previously, when probing a CFI chip which was write-protected at the
hardware level, the probe would fail due to the fact it could not put
the chip into QUERY mode. This would result in no MTD devices being
created.

Add a fallback to probe using the map_rom driver if the user-selected
probe fails.
