dmaengine: tegra: add slave capabilities reporting

After commit ecc19d17868be9c9f8f00ed928791533c420f3e0 ("dmaengine: Add
a warning for drivers not using the generic slave caps retrieval"),
the Tegra APB DMA driver causes this warning during boot:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at drivers/dma/dmaengine.c:830 dma_async_device_register+0x294/0x538()
this driver doesn't support generic slave capabilities reporting

Fix by setting the appropriate reporting structure fields that are
passed to dma_async_device_register().
