ipv6: directly include libc-compat.h in ipv6.h

Patch 3b50d9029809 ("ipv6: fix redefinition of in6_pktinfo ...")
fixed a libc compatibility issue in ipv6 structure definitions
as described in include/uapi/linux/libc-compat.h.

It relies on including linux/in6.h to include libc-compat.h itself.
Include that file directly to clearly communicate the dependency
(libc-compat.h: "This include must be as early as possible").
