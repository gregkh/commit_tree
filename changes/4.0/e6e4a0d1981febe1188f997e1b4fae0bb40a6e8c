ARM: dts: AM335x: Make charge delay a DT parameter for TSC

The charge delay value is by default 0x400. But it can be set to lower
values on some boards, as long as false pen-ups are avoided. Lowering the
value increases the sampling rate (though current sampling rate is
sufficient for TSC operation). In some boards, the value has to be
increased to avoid false pen-up events. Hence, charge delay has been
made a DT parameter.
