ARM: qcom: scm: Fix incorrect cache invalidation

The cache invalidation in scm_call() correctly rounds down the start
address to invalidate the beginning of the cacheline but doesn't properly
round up the 'end' address to make it aligned.  The last chunk of the
buffer won't be invalidated when 'end' is not cacheline size aligned so
make sure to invalidate the last few bytes in such situations. It also
doesn't do anything about outer caches so make sure to invalidate and flush
those as well.
