s390/topology: delay initialization of topology cpu masks

There is no reason to initialize the topology cpu masks already while
setup_arch() is being called. It is sufficient to initialize the masks
before the scheduler becomes SMP aware.
Therefore a pre-SMP initcall aka early_initcall is suffucient.

This also allows to convert the cpu_topology array into a per cpu
variable with a later patch. Without this patch this wouldn't be
possible since the per cpu memory areas are not allocated while setup_arch
is executed.
