dt-bindings: usb-ehci: Add an optional property "needs-reset-on-resume"

Add device-tree bindings for EHCI so we can use "needs-reset-on-resume"
property to force EHCI reset after resume if necessary. This is necessary
on platforms like rk3288 that need a reset after resume to detect if a
device has been disconnected during suspend time.
