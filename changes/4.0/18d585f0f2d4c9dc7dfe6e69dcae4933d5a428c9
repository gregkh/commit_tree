ocfs2: make append_dio an incompat feature

It turns out that making this feature ro_compat isn't quite enough to
prevent accidental corruption on mount from older kernels.  Ocfs2 (like
other file systems) will process orphaned inodes even when the user mounts
in 'ro' mode.  So for the case of a filesystem not knowing the append_dio
feature, mounting the filesystem could result in orphaned-for-dio files
being deleted, which we clearly don't want.

So instead, turn this into an incompat flag.

Btw, this is kind of my fault - initially I asked that we add a flag to
cover the feature and even suggested that we use an ro flag.  It wasn't
until I was looking through our commits for v4.0-rc1 that I realized we
actually want this to be incompat.
