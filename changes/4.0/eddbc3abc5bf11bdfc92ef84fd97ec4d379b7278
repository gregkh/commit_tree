mmc: slot-gpio: Remove option to explicitly free requested CD/WP GPIOs

The slot-gpio uses the devm*_ managed functions. Still it provide APIs
to explicitly free requested CD/WP GPIOs, but these API isn't being
used.

Therefore let's simplify slot-gpio by removing these unused APIs. If it
later turns out we need some of them, we can always consider to restore
the code.
