s390/vdso: fix clock_gettime for CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, -2 and -3

Git commit 8d8f2e18a6dbd3d09dd918788422e6ac8c878e96
"s390/vdso: ectg gettime support for CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID"
broke clock_gettime for CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID.

Git commit c742b31c03f37c5c499178f09f57381aa6c70131
"fast vdso implementation for CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID"
introduced the ECTG for clock id -2. Correct would have been
clock id -3.

Fix the whole mess, CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID is based on
CPUCLOCK_SCHED and can not be speed up by the vdso. A speedup
is only available for clock id -3 which is CPUCLOCK_VIRT for
the task currently running on the CPU.
