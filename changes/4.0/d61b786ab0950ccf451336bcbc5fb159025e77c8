staging: comedi: adv_pci1710: do comedi_handle_events() in common code patch

The pci1710_handle_every_sample() and pci1710_handle_fifo() helpers, called by
the interrupt handler, both have multiple comedi_handle_events() calls. Remove
these and just do a single comedi_handle_events() at the end of the interrupt
handler.
