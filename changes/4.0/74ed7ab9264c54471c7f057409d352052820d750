openvswitch: Add support for unique flow IDs.

Previously, flows were manipulated by userspace specifying a full,
unmasked flow key. This adds significant burden onto flow
serialization/deserialization, particularly when dumping flows.

This patch adds an alternative way to refer to flows using a
variable-length "unique flow identifier" (UFID). At flow setup time,
userspace may specify a UFID for a flow, which is stored with the flow
and inserted into a separate table for lookup, in addition to the
standard flow table. Flows created using a UFID must be fetched or
deleted using the UFID.

All flow dump operations may now be made more terse with OVS_UFID_F_*
flags. For example, the OVS_UFID_F_OMIT_KEY flag allows responses to
omit the flow key from a datapath operation if the flow has a
corresponding UFID. This significantly reduces the time spent assembling
and transacting netlink messages. With all OVS_UFID_F_OMIT_* flags
enabled, the datapath only returns the UFID and statistics for each flow
during flow dump, increasing ovs-vswitchd revalidator performance by 40%
or more.
