lib: bitmap: remove redundant code from __bitmap_shift_left

The first of these conditionals is completely redundant: If k == lim-1, we
must have off==0, so the second conditional will also trigger and then it
wouldn't matter if upper had some high bits set.  But the second
conditional is in fact also redundant, since it only serves to clear out
some high-order "don't care" bits of dst, about which no guarantee is
made.
