cxl: Add ability to reset the card

Adds reset to sysfs which will PERST the card. If load_image_on_perst is set
to "user" or "factory", the PERST will cause that image to be loaded.

load_image_on_perst is set to "user" for production.

"none" could be used for debugging. The PSL trace arrays are preserved which
then can be read through debugfs.

PERST also triggers CAPP recovery. An HMI comes in, which is handled by EEH.
EEH unbinds the driver, calls into Sapphire to reinitialize the PHB, then
rebinds the driver.
