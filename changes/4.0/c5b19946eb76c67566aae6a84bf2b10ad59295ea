kernel: Fix sparse warning for ACCESS_ONCE

Commit 927609d622a3 ("kernel: tighten rules for ACCESS ONCE") results in
sparse warnings like "Using plain integer as NULL pointer" - Let's add a
type cast to the dummy assignment.
To avoid warnings lik "sparse: warning: cast to restricted __hc32" we also
use __force on that cast.
