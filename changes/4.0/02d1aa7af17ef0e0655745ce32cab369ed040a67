IB/core: Add support for extended query device caps

Add extensible query device capabilities verb to allow adding new features.
ib_uverbs_ex_query_device is added and copy_query_dev_fields is used to copy
capability fields to be used by both ib_uverbs_query_device and
ib_uverbs_ex_query_device.

Following the discussion about this patch [1], the code now validates
the command's comp_mask is zero, returning -EINVAL for unknown values,
in order to allow extending the verb in the future.

The verb also checks the user-space provided response buffer size and
only fills in capabilities that will fit in the buffer. In attempt to
follow the spirit of presentation [2] by Tzahi Oved that was presented
during OpenFabrics Alliance International Developer Workshop 2013, the
comp_mask bits will only describe which fields are valid.  Furthermore,
fields that can simply be cleared when they are not supported, do not
require a comp_mask bit at all.  The verb returns a response_length
field containing the actual number of bytes written by the kernel, so
that a newer version running on an older kernel can tell which fields
were actually returned.
