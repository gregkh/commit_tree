tracing: Update the TRACE_EVENT fields available in the sample code

The sample code in samples/trace_events/ is extremely out of date and does
not show all the new fields that have been added since the sample code
was written. As most people are unaware of these new fields, adding sample
code and explanations of those fields should help out.
