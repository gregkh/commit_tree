drm/i915: Consolidate ring freespace calculations

There are numerous places in the code where the driver's idea of
how much space is left in a ring is updated using the driver's
latest notions of the positions of 'head' and 'tail' for the ring.
Among them are some that update one or both of these values before
(re)doing the calculation. In particular, there are four different
places in the code where 'last_retired_head' is copied to 'head'
and then set to -1; and two of these do not have a guard to check
that it has actually been updated since last time it was consumed,
leaving the possibility that the dummy -1 can be transferred from
'last_retired_head' to 'head', causing the space calculation to
produce 'impossible' results (previously seen on Android/VLV).

This code therefore consolidates all the calculation and updating of
these values, such that there is only one place where the ring space
is updated, and it ALWAYS uses (and consumes) 'last_retired_head' if
(and ONLY if) it has been updated since the last call.
