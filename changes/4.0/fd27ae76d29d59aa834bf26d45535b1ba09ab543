staging: comedi: pcl812: fix logic error in pcl812_ai_setup_dma()

commit 92afc2b229038d7b962ae69de5b07bc6c1cf51bf inroduced a logic error
in the DMA size calculation.

If the 'nsamples' is greater than the 'unread_samples' then DMA needs to
be restarted. The current code checks it agains the 'max_samples'.
