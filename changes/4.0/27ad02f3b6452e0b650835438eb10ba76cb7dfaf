ASoC: wm8804: Constify struct regmap_config and snd_soc_codec_driver

The regmap_config struct may be const because it is not modified by the
driver and regmap_init() accepts pointer to const. Make struct
snd_soc_codec_driver (snd_soc_register_codec() accepts pointer to const)
and array of default register values const as well.
