at86rf230: remove version check for AT86RF212

This version check allows the driver to only work with v=1 hardware
however there is no driver-facing difference with newer versions
(confirmed by Atmel FAEs) so this check needlessly prevents the driver
from being used with radios now in production.

Tested on AT86RF212B radio (which came up as v=3).
