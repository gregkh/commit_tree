ocfs2: update web page + git tree in documentation

We (the Ocfs2 project) recently moved the location of our ocfs2-tools
git tree and project web page.  The pertinent discussion can be seen
here:

  https://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/ocfs2-devel/2015-February/010579.html

The following patch updates the Ocfs2 documentation in MAINTAINERS,
ocfs2.txt, and dlmfs.txt.  I added our new official web page, changed
the location of our tools git tree and removed the link to Joel's
ancient kernel git tree - Andrew has handled our patches for a while
now.
