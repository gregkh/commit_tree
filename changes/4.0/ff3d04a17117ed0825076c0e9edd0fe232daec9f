drm/amdkfd: Add new VI-specific queue properties

This patch adds new fields to the queue_properties structure. The new fields
are relevant only for queues running on AMD GPU VI architecture.

The eop_ring_buffer_address and eop_ring_buffer_size describe an
end-of-pipe queue which is assigned to the MQD. In CI, the EOP queue was per
pipeline and in VI it is per queue.

The ctx_save_restore_area_address and ctx_save_restore_area_size describe a
memory area that is designated to allow the CP to do context save/restore in
mid-wave state.

This patch also modifies the set_queue_properties_from_user() (called from
kfd_ioctl_create_queue()) to check and copy those new parameters.
