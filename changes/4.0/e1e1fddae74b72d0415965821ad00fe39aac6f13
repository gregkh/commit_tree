arm64/mm: add explicit struct_mm argument to __create_mapping()

Currently, swapper_pg_dir and idmap_pg_dir share the init_mm mm_struct
instance. To allow the introduction of other pg_dir instances, for instance,
for UEFI's mapping of Runtime Services, make the struct_mm instance an
explicit argument that gets passed down to the pmd and pte instantiation
functions. Note that the consumers (pmd_populate/pgd_populate) of the
mm_struct argument don't actually inspect it, but let's fix it for
correctness' sake.
