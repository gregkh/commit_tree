staging: comedi: addi_apci_1500: use amcc_s5933.h defines

PCI Bar 0 accesses the AMCC S5933 PCI controller used on this board.
Use the defines from amcc_35933.h and remove the "magic" numbers.

Rename the CamelCase private data member 'i_IobaseAmcc' used to hold
the address for PCI Bar 0.

Remove the unnecessary 'ui_Status' local variable in apci1500_do_bits()
that is used to hold the result of some dummy reads. Rename the
CamelCase local variable 'ui_InterruptStatus' that is used to check the
interrupt from the amcc chip.
