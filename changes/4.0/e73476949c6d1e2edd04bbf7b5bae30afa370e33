cpufreq: stats: don't update stats on false notifiers

We need to call cpufreq_stats_update() to update 'time_in_state' for the last
frequency. This is achieved by calling it from cpufreq_stat_notifier_trans(),
which is called after frequency transition.

But if we detect that the cpu's frequency haven't really changed and its a false
POSTCHANGE notification, we don't really need to update time_in_state.

It wouldn't cause any harm in calling cpufreq_stats_update() but we can avoid
calling it here and call it when the frequency really changes. The result will
be the same but more efficient.
