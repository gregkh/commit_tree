bonding: Bonding Overriding Configuration logic restored.

Before commit 3900f29021f0bc7fe9815aa32f1a993b7dfdd402 ("bonding: slight
optimizztion for bond_slave_override()") the override logic was to send packets
with non-zero queue_id through the slave with corresponding queue_id, under two
conditions only - if the slave can transmit and it's up.

The above mentioned commit changed this logic by introducing an additional
condition - whether the bond is active (indirectly, using the slave_can_tx and
later - bond_is_active_slave), that prevents the user from implementing more
complex policies according to the Documentation/networking/bonding.txt.
