gpio: sch: Add support for Intel Quark X1000 SoC

Intel Quark X1000 provides a total of 16 GPIOs. The GPIOs are split between
the legacy I/O bridge and the GPIO controller.

GPIO-SCH is the GPIO pins on legacy bridge for Intel Quark SoC.
Intel Quark X1000 has 2 GPIOs powered by the core power well and 6 from
the suspend power well.

This piece of work is derived from Dan O'Donovan's initial work for Quark
X1000 enabling.
