powerpc/eeh: Introduce flag EEH_PE_REMOVED

The conditions that one specific PE's frozen count exceeds the maximal
allowed times (EEH_MAX_ALLOWED_FREEZES) and it's in isolated or recovery
state indicate the PE was removed permanently implicitly. The patch
introduces flag EEH_PE_REMOVED to indicate that explicitly so that we
don't depend on the fixed maximal allowed times, which can be varied as
we do in subsequent patch.

Flag EEH_PE_REMOVED is expected to be marked for the PE whose frozen
count exceeds the maximal allowed times, or just failed from recovery.
