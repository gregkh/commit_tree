ata: libahci: Clean-up the ahci_platform_en/disable_phys functions

The phy_ functions handle the NULL pointer case, so there is no need
to skip them if there is a NULL pointer. Moreover, after the error
label there is already no check on the pointer. This patch removes the
unnecessary tests and brings some consistency.
