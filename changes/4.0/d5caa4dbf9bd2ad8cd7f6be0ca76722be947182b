s390/jump label: use different nop instruction

Use a brcl 0,2 instruction for jump label nops during compile time,
so we don't mix up the different nops during mcount/hotpatch call
site detection.
The initial jump label code instruction replacement will exchange
these instructions with either a branch or a brcl 0,0 instruction.
