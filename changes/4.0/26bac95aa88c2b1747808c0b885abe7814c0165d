clk: divider: fix selection of divider when rounding to closest

It's an invalid approach to assume that among two divider values
the one nearer the exact divider is the better one.

Assume a parent rate of 1000 Hz, a divider with CLK_DIVIDER_POWER_OF_TWO
and a target rate of 89 Hz. The exact divider is ~ 11.236 so 8 and 16
are the candidates to choose from yielding rates 125 Hz and 62.5 Hz
respectivly. While 8 is nearer to 11.236 than 16 is, the latter is still
the better divider as 62.5 is nearer to 89 than 125 is.
