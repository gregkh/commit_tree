dm: fix add_disk() NULL pointer due to race with free_dev()

Commit c4db59d31e39 ("fs: don't reassign dirty inodes to
default_backing_dev_info") exposed DM to a latent race in free_dev() vs
add_disk() in relation to management of the device's minor number.

Fix this by refactoring free_dev() to match cleanup order of the
alloc_dev() error path.  Move cleanup of the gendisk, queue, and bdev
to _before_ the cleanup of the idr managed minor number.

Also, purely due to cleanup that fell out during the free_dev() audit:
- adjust dm_blk_close() to access the gendisk's private_data under
  the _minor_lock spinlock.
- move __dm_destroy()'s dm_get_live_table() call out from under the
  _minor_lock spinlock.
