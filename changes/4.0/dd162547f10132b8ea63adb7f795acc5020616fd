[media] v4l: omap4iss: Remove bogus frame number propagation

Frame number propagation tries to increase the robustness of the frame
number counter by using sources less likely to be missed than the end of
frame interrupts, such as hardware frame counters or start of frame
interrupts.

Increasing the frame number in the IPIPE ISIF and resizer end of frame
interrupt handlers is pointless as it doesn't bring any improvement.
Don't do it.
