Bluetooth: Fix valid Identity Address check

According to the Bluetooth core specification valid identity addresses
are either Public Device Addresses or Static Random Addresses. IRKs
received with any other type of address should be discarded since we
cannot assume to know the permanent identity of the peer device.

This patch fixes a missing check for the Identity Address when receiving
the Identity Address Information SMP PDU.
