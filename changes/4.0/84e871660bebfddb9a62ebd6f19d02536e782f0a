ARM: at91: pm: fix at91rm9200 standby

at91rm9200 standby and suspend to ram has been broken since
00482a4078f4. It is wrongly using AT91_BASE_SYS which is a physical address
and actually doesn't correspond to any register on at91rm9200.

Use the correct at91_ramc_base[0] instead.

Fixes: 00482a4078f4 (ARM: at91: implement the standby function for pm/cpuidle)
