Bluetooth: Add restarting to service discovery

When using LE_SCAN_FILTER_DUP_ENABLE, some controllers would send
advertising report from each LE device only once. That means that we
don't get any updates on RSSI value, and makes Service Discovery very
slow. This patch adds restarting scan when in Service Discovery, and
device with filtered uuid is found, but it's not in RSSI range to send
event yet. This way if device moves into range, we will quickly get RSSI
update.
