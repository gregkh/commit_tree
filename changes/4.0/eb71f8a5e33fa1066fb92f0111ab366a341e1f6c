Added Little Endian support to vtpm module

The tpm_ibmvtpm module is affected by an unaligned access problem.
ibmvtpm_crq_get_version failed with rc=-4 during boot when vTPM is
enabled in Power partition, which supports both little endian and
big endian modes.

We added little endian support to fix this problem:
1) added cpu_to_be64 calls to ensure BE data is sent from an LE OS.
2) added be16_to_cpu and be32_to_cpu calls to make sure data received
   is in LE format on a LE OS.
