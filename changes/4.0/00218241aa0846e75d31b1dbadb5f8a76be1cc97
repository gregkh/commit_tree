ARM: 8258/1: l2c: use l2c_write_sec() for restoring latency and filter regs

All four register for latency and filter settings cannot be written in
non-secure mode and they should go through l2c_write_sec(). More on this
can be found in CoreLink Level 2 Cache Controller L2C-310 Technical
Reference Manual, 3.2. Register summary, table 3.1. This have been checked
the TRM for r3p3, but it should be uniform for all revisions.
