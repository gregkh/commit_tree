vhost: cleanup iterator update logic

Recent iterator-related changes in vhost made it
harder to follow the logic fixing up the header.
In fact, the fixup always happens at the same
offset: sizeof(virtio_net_hdr): sometimes the
fixup iterator is updated by copy_to_iter,
sometimes-by iov_iter_advance.

Rearrange code to make this obvious.
