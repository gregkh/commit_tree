udp: pass udp_offload struct to UDP gro callbacks

This patch introduces udp_offload_callbacks which has the same
GRO functions (but not a GSO function) as offload_callbacks,
except there is an argument to a udp_offload struct passed to
gro_receive and gro_complete functions. This additional argument
can be used to retrieve the per port structure of the encapsulation
for use in gro processing (mostly by doing container_of on the
structure).
