sh_eth: Fix lost MAC address on kexec

Commit 740c7f31c094703c ("sh_eth: Ensure DMA engines are stopped before
freeing buffers") added a call to sh_eth_reset() to the
sh_eth_set_ringparam() and sh_eth_close() paths.

However, setting the software reset bit(s) in the EDMR register resets
the MAC Address Registers to zero. Hence after kexec, the new kernel
doesn't detect a valid MAC address and assigns a random MAC address,
breaking DHCP.

Set the MAC address again after the reset in sh_eth_dev_exit() to fix
this.

Tested on r8a7740/armadillo (GETHER) and r8a7791/koelsch (FAST_RCAR).
