drm/i915: Specify bsd rings through exec flag

On Skylake GT3 we have 2 Video Command Streamers (VCS), which is asymmetrical.
For example, HEVC GPU commands can be only dispatched to VCS1 ring.
But userspace has no control when using VCS1 or VCS2. This patch introduces
a mechanism to avoid the default ping-pong mode and use one specific ring
through execution flag. This mechanism is usable for all the platforms
with 2 VCS rings.

The open source usage is from these two commits in vaapi/intel:

	    Allow the batchbuffer to be submitted with override flag

	    Add the override flag to assure that HEVC video command
		always uses BSD ring0 for SKL GT3 machine
