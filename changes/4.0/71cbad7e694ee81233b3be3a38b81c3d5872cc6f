ovl: upper fs should not be R/O

After importing multi-lower layer support, users could mount a r/o
partition as the left most lowerdir instead of using it as upperdir.
And a r/o upperdir may cause an error like

	overlayfs: failed to create directory ./workdir/work

during mount.

This patch check the *s_flags* of upper fs and return an error if
it is a r/o partition. The checking of *upper_mnt->mnt_sb->s_flags*
can be removed now.

This patch also remove

	/* FIXME: workdir is not needed for a R/O mount */

from ovl_fill_super() because:

1) for upper fs r/o case
Setting a r/o partition as upper is prevented, no need to care about
workdir in this case.

2) for "mount overlay -o ro" with a r/w upper fs case
Users could remount overlayfs to r/w in this case, so workdir should
not be omitted.
