writeback: add missing INITIAL_JIFFIES init in global_update_bandwidth()

global_update_bandwidth() uses static variable update_time as the
timestamp for the last update but forgets to initialize it to
INITIALIZE_JIFFIES.

This means that global_dirty_limit will be 5 mins into the future on
32bit and some large amount jiffies into the past on 64bit.  This
isn't critical as the only effect is that global_dirty_limit won't be
updated for the first 5 mins after booting on 32bit machines,
especially given the auxiliary nature of global_dirty_limit's role -
protecting against global dirty threshold's sudden dips; however, it
does lead to unintended suboptimal behavior.  Fix it.
