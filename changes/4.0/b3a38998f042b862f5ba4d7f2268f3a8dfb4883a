drm/i915: Fix a use after free, and unbalanced refcounting

When converting from implicitly tracked execlist queue items to ref counted
requests, not all frees of requests were replaced with unrefs, and extraneous
refs/unrefs of contexts were added.
Correct the unbalanced refcount & replace the frees.
Remove a noisy warning when hitting the request creation path.

drm_i915_gem_request and intel_context are both kref reference counted
structures. Upon allocation, drm_i915_gem_request's ref count should be
bumped using kref_init. When a context is assigned to the request,
the context's reference count should be bumped using i915_gem_context_reference.
i915_gem_request_reference will reduce the context reference count when
the request is freed.

     drm/i915: Subsume intel_ctx_submit_request in to drm_i915_gem_request

v2: Added comments explaining how the ctx pointer and the request object should
be ref-counted. Removed noisy warning.
