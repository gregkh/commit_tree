hpsa: do not request device rescan on every ioaccel path error

The original reasoning behind doing this was faulty.  An error
of some sort would be encountered, accelerated i/o would be
disabled for that logical drive, the command would be kicked
back out to the SCSI midlayer for a retry, and since i/o accelerator
mode was disabled, it would get retried down the RAID path.
However, something needs to turn ioaccellerator mode back on,
and this rescan request was what did that.  However, it was racy,
and extremely bad for performance to rescan all devices, so,
don't do that.
