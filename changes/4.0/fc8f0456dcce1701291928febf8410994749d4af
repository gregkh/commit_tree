mwifiex: disable UAPSD mode when AP starts

When AP is started, firmware exits power save mode. This
means power save manager of AP takes priority over station.
Firmware stop sending periodic AWAKE events to host.

We may have UAPSD enabled on station which buffers data
packets until AWAKE event from firmware. Data path is
unnecessarily blocked in this case. This patch disables
UAPSD mode to reenable transmit data path.
