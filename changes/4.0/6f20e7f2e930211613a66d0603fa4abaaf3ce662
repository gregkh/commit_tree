powerpc/kernel: Avoid memory corruption at early stage

When calling to early_setup(), we pick "boot_paca" up for the master CPU
and initialize that with initialise_paca(). At that point, the SLB
shadow buffer isn't populated yet. Updating the SLB shadow buffer should
corrupt what we had in physical address 0 where the trap instruction is
usually stored.

This hasn't been observed to cause any trouble in practice, but is
obviously fishy.
