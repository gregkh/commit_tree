mm: numa: mark huge PTEs young when clearing NUMA hinting faults

Base PTEs are marked young when the NUMA hinting information is cleared
but the same does not happen for huge pages which this patch addresses.

Note that migrated pages are not marked young as the base page migration
code does not assume that migrated pages have been referenced.  This
could be addressed but beyond the scope of this series which is aimed at
Dave Chinners shrink workload that is unlikely to be affected by this
issue.
