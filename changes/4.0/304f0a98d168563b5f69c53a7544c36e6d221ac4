mmc: sdhci: Fix FSL ESDHC reset handling quirk

The commit 0718e59ae259 ("mmc: sdhci: move FSL ESDHC reset handling quirk into
esdhc code") states that Freescale esdhc is the only controller which needs
the interrupt registers restored after a reset. So it moves
SDHCI_QUIRK_RESTORE_IRQS_AFTER_RESET quirk handling code into the
esdhc-imx driver only. Unfortunately the same controller is used in
other boards which use the of-esdhc driver instead (like powerpc P2020).

Restore interrupts after reset in the sdhci-of-esdhc driver also.
