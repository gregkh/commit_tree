drm/i915: execlist request keeps ptr/ref to gem_request

Add a reference and pointer from the execlist queue item to the associated
gem request. For execlist requests that don't have a request, create one
as a placeholder.

Issue: VIZ-4274
v1: Rebase after upstream of "Replace seqno values with request structures" patchset.
