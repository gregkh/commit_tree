KVM: s390: Allow userspace to limit guest memory size

With commit c6c956b80bdf ("KVM: s390/mm: support gmap page tables with less
than 5 levels") we are able to define a limit for the guest memory size.

As we round up the guest size in respect to the levels of page tables
we get to guest limits of: 2048 MB, 4096 GB, 8192 TB and 16384 PB.
We currently limit the guest size to 16 TB, which means we end up
creating a page table structure supporting guest sizes up to 8192 TB.

This patch introduces an interface that allows userspace to tune
this limit. This may bring performance improvements for small guests.
