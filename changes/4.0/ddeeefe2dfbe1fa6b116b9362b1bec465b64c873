arm64/efi: efistub: Apply __init annotation

This ensures all stub component are freed when the kernel proper is
done booting, by prefixing the names of all ELF sections that have
the SHF_ALLOC attribute with ".init". This approach ensures that even
implicitly emitted allocated data (like initializer values and string
literals) are covered.

At the same time, remove some __init annotations in the stub that have
now become redundant, and add the __init annotation to handle_kernel_image
which will now trigger a section mismatch warning without it.
