fs: make shrinker memcg aware

Now, to make any list_lru-based shrinker memcg aware we should only
initialize its list_lru as memcg aware.  Let's do it for the general FS
shrinker (super_block::s_shrink).

There are other FS-specific shrinkers that use list_lru for storing
objects, such as XFS and GFS2 dquot cache shrinkers, but since they
reclaim objects that are shared among different cgroups, there is no point
making them memcg aware.  It's a big question whether we should account
them to memcg at all.
