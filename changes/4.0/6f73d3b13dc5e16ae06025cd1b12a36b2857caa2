rhashtable: add a note for grow and shrink decision functions

As commit c0c09bfdc415 ("rhashtable: avoid unnecessary wakeup for
worker queue") moves condition statements of verifying whether hash
table size exceeds its maximum threshold or reaches its minimum
threshold from resizing functions to resizing decision functions,
we should add a note in rhashtable.h to indicate the implementation
of what the grow and shrink decision function must enforce min/max
shift, otherwise, it's failed to take min/max shift's set watermarks
into effect.
