x86, traps: Fix ist_enter from userspace

context_tracking_user_exit() has no effect if in_interrupt() returns true,
so ist_enter() didn't work.  Fix it by calling exception_enter(), and thus
context_tracking_user_exit(), before incrementing the preempt count.

This also adds an assertion that will catch the problem reliably if
CONFIG_PROVE_RCU=y to help prevent the bug from being reintroduced.
