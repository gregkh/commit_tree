ALSA: pcm: Add snd_interval_ranges() and snd_pcm_hw_constraint_ranges()

Add helper functions to allow drivers to specify several disjoint
ranges for a variable. In particular, there is a codec (PCM512x) that
has a hole in its supported range of rates, due to PLL and divider
restrictions.

This is like snd_pcm_hw_constraint_list(), but for ranges instead of
points.
