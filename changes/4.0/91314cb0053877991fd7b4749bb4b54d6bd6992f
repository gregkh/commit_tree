arm/arm64: KVM: Add exit reaons to kvm_exit event tracing

This patch extends trace_kvm_exit() to include KVM exit reasons
(i.e. EC of HSR). The tracing function then dumps both exit reason
and PC of vCPU, shown as the following. Tracing tools can use this
new exit_reason field to better understand the behavior of guest VMs.
