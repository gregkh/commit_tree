mm: /proc/pid/clear_refs: avoid split_huge_page()

Currently pagewalker splits all THP pages on any clear_refs request.  It's
not necessary.  We can handle this on PMD level.

One side effect is that soft dirty will potentially see more dirty memory,
since we will mark whole THP page dirty at once.

Sanity checked with CRIU test suite. More testing is required.
