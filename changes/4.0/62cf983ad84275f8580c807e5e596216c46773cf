mmc: sdhci-pxav3: fix unbalanced clock issues during probe

Commit 0dcaa2499b7d ("sdhci-pxav3: Fix runtime PM initialization") tries
to fix one hang issue caused by calling sdhci_add_host() on a suspended
device. The fix enables the clock twice, once by clk_prepare_enable() and
another by pm_runtime_get_sync(), meaning that the clock will never be
gated at runtime PM suspend. I observed the power consumption regression on
Marvell BG2Q SoCs.

In fact, the fix is not correct. There still be a very small window
during which a runtime suspend might somehow occur after pm_runtime_enable()
but before pm_runtime_get_sync().

This patch fixes all of the two problems by just incrementing the usage
counter before pm_runtime_enable(). It also adjust the order of disabling
runtime pm and storing the usage count in the error path to handle clock
gating properly.
