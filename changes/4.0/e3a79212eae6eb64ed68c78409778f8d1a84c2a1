Input: alps - report V2 Dualpoint Stick events via the right evdev node

On V2 devices the DualPoint Stick reports bare packets, these should be
reported via the "AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick" dev2 evdev node, which also
has the INPUT_PROP_POINTING_STICK propbit set.

Note that since there is no way to distinguish these packets from an external
PS/2 mouse (insofar as these laptops have an external PS/2 port) this means
that we will be reporting PS/2 mouse events via this evdev node too, as we've
been doing in kernel 3.19 and older.

This has been tested on a Dell Latitude D620 and a Dell Latitude E6400,
which both have a V2 touchpad + a DualPoint Stick which reports bare packets.
