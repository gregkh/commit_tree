UBI: Add initial support for scatter gather

Adds a new set of functions to deal with scatter gather.
ubi_eba_read_leb_sg() will read from a LEB into a scatter gather list.
The new data structure struct ubi_sgl will be used within UBI to
hold the scatter gather list itself and metadata to have a cursor
within the list.
