Revert "sh_eth: Enable Rx descriptor word 0 shift for r8a7790"

This reverts commit fd9af07c3404ac9ecbd0d859563360f51ce1ffde.

The hardware manual states that the frame error and multicast bits are
copied to bits 9:0 of RD0, not bits 25:16.  I've tested that this is
true for RFS1 (CRC error), RFS3 (frame too short), RFS4 (frame too
long) and RFS8 (multicast).

Also adjust a comment to agree with this.
