drivers/scsi/csiostor/csio_hw.c:536:31: sparse: incorrect type in assignment
(different base types)
drivers/scsi/csiostor/csio_hw.c:536:31:    expected unsigned int [unsigned]
[usertype] <noident>
drivers/scsi/csiostor/csio_hw.c:536:31:    got restricted __be32 [usertype]
<noident>
>> drivers/scsi/csiostor/csio_hw.c:2012:5: sparse: symbol 'csio_hw_prep_fw' was
not declared. Should it be static?
