ARM: 8268/1: configs: Enable DEBUG_LL_UART_8250 where needed

All defconfigs touched by this patch already enable DEBUG_LL and by
default DEBUG_LL_UART_NONE will be selected. This causes no issues
today because due to some back compatibility magic we eventually need
to remove it is not actually honoured. Nevertheless DEBUG_LL_UART_8250
is the right value for these platforms and should be set in the config
files.
