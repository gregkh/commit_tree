mac80211: minstrel: reduce size of struct minstrel_rate_stats

On minstrel_ht, the size of the per-sta struct is almost 18k, making it
an order-3 allocation.
A few fields inside the per-rate statistics are bigger than they need to
be. This patch reduces the size enough to cut down the per-sta struct to
about 13k (order-2 allocation).
