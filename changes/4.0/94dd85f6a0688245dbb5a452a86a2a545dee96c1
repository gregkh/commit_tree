x86/xen: prefer TSC over xen clocksource for dom0

In Dom0's the use of the TSC clocksource (whenever it is stable enough to
be used) instead of the Xen clocksource should not cause any issues, as
Dom0 VMs never live-migrated.  The TSC clocksource is somewhat more
efficient than the Xen paravirtualised clocksource, thus it should have
higher rating.

This patch decreases the rating of the Xen clocksource in Dom0s to 275.
Which is half-way between the rating of the TSC clocksource (300) and the
hpet clocksource (250).
