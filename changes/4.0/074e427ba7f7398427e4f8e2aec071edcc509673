xfs: sanitise sb_bad_features2 handling

We currently have to ensure that every time we update sb_features2
that we update sb_bad_features2. Now that we log and format the
superblock in it's entirety we actually don't have to care because
we can simply update the sb_bad_features2 when we format it into the
buffer. This removes the need for anything but the mount and
superblock formatting code to care about sb_bad_features2, and
hence removes the possibility that we forget to update bad_features2
when necessary in the future.
