KVM: x86: Dirty the dest op page on cmpxchg emulation

Intel SDM says for CMPXCHG: "To simplify the interface to the processorâ€™s bus,
the destination operand receives a write cycle without regard to the result of
the comparison.". This means the destination page should be dirtied.

Fix it to by writing back the original value if cmpxchg failed.
