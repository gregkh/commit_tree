PM / Domains: Add DT bindings for the R-Mobile System Controller

The Renesas R-Mobile System Controller provides a.o. power management
support, following the generic PM domain bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.

For now this supports the R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740) only, but it should be
sufficiently generic to handle other members of the SH-Mobile/R-Mobile
family in the future.
