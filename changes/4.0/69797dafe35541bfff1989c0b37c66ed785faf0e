Revert "x86/mm/ASLR: Propagate base load address calculation"

This reverts commit:

  f47233c2d34f ("x86/mm/ASLR: Propagate base load address calculation")

The main reason for the revert is that the new boot flag does not work
at all currently, and in order to make this work, we need non-trivial
changes to the x86 boot code which we didn't manage to get done in
time for merging.

And even if we did, they would've been too risky so instead of
rushing things and break booting 4.1 on boxes left and right, we
will be very strict and conservative and will take our time with
this to fix and test it properly.
