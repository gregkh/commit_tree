mmc: sdhci-pxav3: Fix Armada 38x controller's caps according to erratum ERR-7878951

According to erratum 'ERR-7878951' Armada 38x SDHCI controller has
different capabilities than the ones shown in its registers:

- it doesn't support the voltage switching: it can work either with
  3.3V or 1.8V supply
- it doesn't support the SDR104 mode
- SDR50 mode doesn't need tuning

The SDHCI_QUIRK_MISSING_CAPS quirk is used for updating the
capabilities accordingly.
