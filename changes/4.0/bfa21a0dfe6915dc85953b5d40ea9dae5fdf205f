regulator: Allow parsing custom properties when using simplified DT parsing

When drivers use simplified DT parsing method (they provide
'regulator_desc.of_match') they still may want to parse custom
properties for some of the regulators. For example some of the
regulators support GPIO enable control.

Add a driver-supplied callback for such case. This way the regulator
core parses common bindings offloading a lot of code from drivers and
still custom properties may be used.

The callback, called for each parsed regulator, may modify the
'regulator_config' initially passed to regulator_register().
