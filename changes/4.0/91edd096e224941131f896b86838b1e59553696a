net: compat: Update get_compat_msghdr() to match copy_msghdr_from_user() behaviour

Commit db31c55a6fb2 (net: clamp ->msg_namelen instead of returning an
error) introduced the clamping of msg_namelen when the unsigned value
was larger than sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage). This caused a
msg_namelen of -1 to be valid. The native code was subsequently fixed by
commit dbb490b96584 (net: socket: error on a negative msg_namelen).

In addition, the native code sets msg_namelen to 0 when msg_name is
NULL. This was done in commit (6a2a2b3ae075 net:socket: set msg_namelen
to 0 if msg_name is passed as NULL in msghdr struct from userland) and
subsequently updated by 08adb7dabd48 (fold verify_iovec() into
copy_msghdr_from_user()).

This patch brings the get_compat_msghdr() in line with
copy_msghdr_from_user().
