watchdog: da9063: Add restart handler support

Register a restart handler for the da9063 watchdog.  System restart is
triggered by sending the shutdown command to the PMIC.
As more-suitable restart handlers may exist, the priority of the
watchdog restart handler is set to 128.

The actual restart method was inspired by a platform-specific patch from
the BSP by Hisashi Nakamura <hisashi.nakamura.ak@renesas.com>.
