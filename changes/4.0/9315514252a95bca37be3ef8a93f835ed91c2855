clk: divider: fix calculation of initial best divider when rounding to closest

Similar to the reasoning for the previous commit

	DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(parent_rate, rate)

might not be the best integer divisor to get a good approximation for
rate from parent_rate (given the metric for CLK_DIVIDER_ROUND_CLOSEST).

For example assume a parent rate of 1000 Hz and a target rate of 700.
Using DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST the suggested divisor gets calculated to 1
resulting in a target rate of 1000 with a delta of 300 to the desired
rate. With choosing 2 as divisor however the resulting rate is 500 which
is nearer to 700.
