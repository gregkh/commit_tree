x86/asm/entry: Check for syscall exit work with IRQs disabled

We currently have a race: if we're preempted during syscall
exit, we can fail to process syscall return work that is queued
up while we're preempted in ret_from_sys_call after checking
ti.flags.

Fix it by disabling interrupts before checking ti.flags.
