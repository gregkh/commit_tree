md/raid5: use ->lock to protect accessing raid5 sysfs attributes.

It is important that mddev->private isn't freed while
a sysfs attribute function is accessing it.

So use mddev->lock to protect the setting of ->private to NULL, and
take that lock when checking ->private for NULL and de-referencing it
in the sysfs access functions.

This only applies to the read ('show') side of access.  Write
access will be handled separately.
