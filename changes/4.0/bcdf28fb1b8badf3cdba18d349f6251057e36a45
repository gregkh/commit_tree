iio: core: Introduce IIO_CHAN_INFO_CALIBHEIGHT

Some devices need the height of the user to compute various
parameters. One of this devices is Freescale's MMA9553L
(http://www.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/ref_manual/MMA9553LSWRM.pdf)
that needs the height of the user to compute the stride length which
is used further to determine distance, speed and activity type.
