MIPS: mm: Remove dead macro definitions

In commit c441d4a54c6e ("MIPS: mm: Only build one microassembler that
is suitable"), the Makefile at arch/mips/mm was rewritten to only
build the "right" microassembler file, depending on whether
CONFIG_CPU_MICROMIPS is set or not.

In the files, however, there are still preprocessor definitions
depending on CONFIG_CPU_MICROMIPS. The #ifdef around them can now
never evaluate to true, so let's remove them altogether.

This inconsistency was found using the undertaker-checkpatch tool.
