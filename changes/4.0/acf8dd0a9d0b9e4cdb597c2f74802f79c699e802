udp: only allow UFO for packets from SOCK_DGRAM sockets

If an over-MTU UDP datagram is sent through a SOCK_RAW socket to a
UFO-capable device, ip_ufo_append_data() sets skb->ip_summed to
CHECKSUM_PARTIAL unconditionally as all GSO code assumes transport layer
checksum is to be computed on segmentation. However, in this case,
skb->csum_start and skb->csum_offset are never set as raw socket
transmit path bypasses udp_send_skb() where they are usually set. As a
result, driver may access invalid memory when trying to calculate the
checksum and store the result (as observed in virtio_net driver).

Moreover, the very idea of modifying the userspace provided UDP header
is IMHO against raw socket semantics (I wasn't able to find a document
clearly stating this or the opposite, though). And while allowing
CHECKSUM_NONE in the UFO case would be more efficient, it would be a bit
too intrusive change just to handle a corner case like this. Therefore
disallowing UFO for packets from SOCK_DGRAM seems to be the best option.
