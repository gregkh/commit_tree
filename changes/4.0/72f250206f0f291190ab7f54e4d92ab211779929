KVM: s390: Provide guest TOD Clock Get/Set Controls

Provide controls for setting/getting the guest TOD clock based on the VM
attribute interface.

Provide TOD and TOD_HIGH vm attributes on s390 for managing guest Time Of
Day clock value.

TOD_HIGH is presently always set to 0. In the future it will contain a high
order expansion of the tod clock value after it overflows the 64-bits of
the TOD.
