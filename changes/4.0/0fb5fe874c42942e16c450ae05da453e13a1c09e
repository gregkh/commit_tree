iommu: Make IOVA domain page size explicit

Systems may contain heterogeneous IOMMUs supporting differing minimum
page sizes, which may also not be common with the CPU page size.
Thus it is practical to have an explicit notion of IOVA granularity
to simplify handling of mapping and allocation constraints.

As an initial step, move the IOVA page granularity from an implicit
compile-time constant to a per-domain property so we can make use
of it in IOVA domain context at runtime. To keep the abstraction tidy,
extend the little API of inline iova_* helpers to parallel some of the
equivalent PAGE_* macros.
