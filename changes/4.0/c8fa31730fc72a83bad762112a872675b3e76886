brd: Request from fdisk 4k alignment

Because of the direct_access() API which returns a PFN. partitions
better start on 4K boundary, else offset ZERO of a partition will
not be aligned and blk_direct_access() will fail the call.

By setting blk_queue_physical_block_size(PAGE_SIZE) we can communicate
this to fdisk and friends.

The call to blk_queue_physical_block_size() is harmless and will
not affect the Kernel behavior in any way. It is only for
communication to user-mode.

before this patch running fdisk on a default size brd of 4M
the first sector offered is 34 (BAD), but after this patch it
will be 40, ie 8 sectors aligned. Also when entering some random
partition sizes the next partition-start sector is offered 8 sectors
aligned after this patch. (Please note that with fdisk the user
can still enter bad values, only the offered default values will
be correct)

Note that with bdev-size > 4M fdisk will try to align on a 1M
boundary (above first-sector will be 2048), in any case.
