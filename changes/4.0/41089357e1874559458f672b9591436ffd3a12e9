arm64: Fix section mismatch on alloc_init_p[mu]d()

Commit 523d6e9fae93 (arm64:mm: free the useless initial page table)
introduced a BUG_ON checking for the allocation type but it was
referring the early_alloc() function in the __init section. This patch
changes the check to slab_is_available() and also relaxes the BUG to a
WARN_ON_ONCE.
