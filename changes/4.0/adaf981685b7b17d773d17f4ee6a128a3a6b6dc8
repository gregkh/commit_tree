fib_trie: Merge leaf into tnode

This change makes it so that leaf and tnode are the same struct.  As a
result there is no need for rt_trie_node anymore since everyting can be
merged into tnode.

On 32b systems this results in the leaf being 4 bytes larger, however I
don't know if that is really an issue as this and an eariler patch that
added bits & pos have increased the size from 20 to 28.  If I am not
mistaken slub/slab allocate on power of 2 sizes so 20 was likely being
rounded up to 32 anyway.
