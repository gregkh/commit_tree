drm/i915: Remove bogus locking check in the hangcheck code

You can _never_ assert that a lock is not held, except in some very
restricted corner cases where it's guranteed that your code is running
single-threade (e.g. driver load before you've published any pointers
leading to that lock).

In addition the early return breaks a bunch of testcases since with
highly concurrent hangcheck stress tests the reset fails to work and
the test doesn't recover and time out.

This regression has been introduced in

    drm/i915: Remove nested work in gpu error handling

Aside: It is possible to check whether a given task doesn't hold a
lock, but only when lockdep is enabled, using the lockdep_assert_held
stuff.
