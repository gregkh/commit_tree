[media] rcar_vin: helper function for streaming stop

The code that tests that capture from a stream has stopped is
presently insufficient and the potential for a race condition
exists where frame capture may generate an interrupt between
requesting the capture process halt and freeing buffers.

This patch refactors code out of rcar_vin_videobuf_release() and
into rcar_vin_wait_stop_streaming(), and ensures there are calls
in places where we need to know that capturing has finished.
