rhashtable: use cond_resched()

If a hash table has 128 slots and 16384 elems, expand to 256 slots
takes more than one second. For larger sets, a soft lockup is detected.

Holding cpu for that long, even in a work queue is a show stopper
for non preemptable kernels.

cond_resched() at strategic points to allow process scheduler
to reschedule us.
