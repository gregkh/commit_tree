hpsa: turn off interrupts when kdump starts

Sometimes when the card is restarted it may cause -
"irq 16: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)"
that is likely caused so, that the card, after the hard reset
finishes, pulls on the irq. Disabling the ints before or after
the hpsa_kdump_hard_reset_controller fixes it.

At this point we can't know in which state the card is,
so using SA5_INTR_OFF + SA5_REPLY_INTR_MASK_OFFSET defines directly,
instead of the function the drivers provides, seems to be apropriate.
