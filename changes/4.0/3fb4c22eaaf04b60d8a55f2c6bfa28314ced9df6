csiostor:Remove T4 FCoE Support.

We found a subtle issue with FCoE on T4 very late in the game
and decided not to productize FCoE on T4 and therefore there
are no customers that will be impacted by this change. Hence
T4 FCoE support is removed. FCoE supported only on T5 cards.

changes in v2:
  - Make the commit message more clearer.
