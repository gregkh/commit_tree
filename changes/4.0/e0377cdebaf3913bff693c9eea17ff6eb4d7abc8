mtd: nand: Request strength instead of bytes for soft BCH

Previously, we requested that drivers pass ecc.size and ecc.bytes when
using NAND_ECC_SOFT_BCH. However, a driver is likely to only know the ECC
strength required for its NAND, so each driver would need to perform a
strength-to-bytes calculation.

Avoid duplicating this calculation in each driver by asking drivers to
pass ecc.size and ecc.strength so that the strength-to-bytes calculation
need only be implemented once.

This reverts/generalizes this commit:
    mtd: nand: Base BCH ECC bytes on required strength
