ASoC: Intel: Select RT5672 ASRC clock source on Cherrytrail and Braswell

On Cherrytrail and Braswell, the I2S BCLK is 100FS which cannot be supported
by RT5672 in slave mode and can cause noise. This patch selects codec ASRC
clock source to track I2S1 clock so that codec ASRC can be enabled to suppress
the noise.
