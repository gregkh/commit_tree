cpufreq: stats: drop unnecessary locking

There is no possibility of any race on updating last_index, trans_table or
total_trans as these are updated only by cpufreq_stat_notifier_trans() which
will be called sequentially.

The only place where locking is still relevant is: cpufreq_stats_update(), which
updates time_in_state and last_time. This can be called by two thread in
parallel, that may result in races.

The two threads being:
- sysfs read of time_in_state
- and frequency transition that calls cpufreq_stat_notifier_trans().

Remove locking from the first case mentioned above.
