bnx2x: Fix statistics locking scheme

Statistics' state-machine in bnx2x driver must be synced with various driver
flows, but its current locking scheme manages to be wasteful [using 2 locks +
additional local variable] and prone to race-conditions at the same time,
as the state-machine and 'action' are being accessed under different locks.

In addition, current 'safe exec' isn't in fact safe, since the only guarantee
it gives is that DMA transactions are over, but ramrods might still be running.

This patch cleans up said logic, leaving us with a single lock for the entire
flow and removing the possible races.

Changes from v2:
	- Switched into mutex locking from semaphore locking.
	- Release locks on error flows.

Changes from v1:
	Failure to acquire lock fails flow instead of printing a warning and
	allowing access to the critical section.
