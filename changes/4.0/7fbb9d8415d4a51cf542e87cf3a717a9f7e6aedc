xen-netback: release pending index before pushing Tx responses

If the pending indexes are released /after/ pushing the Tx response
then a stale pending index may be used if a new Tx request is
immediately pushed by the frontend.  The may cause various WARNINGs or
BUGs if the stale pending index is actually still in use.

Fix this by releasing the pending index before pushing the Tx
response.

The full barrier for the pending ring update is not required since the
the Tx response push already has a suitable write barrier.
