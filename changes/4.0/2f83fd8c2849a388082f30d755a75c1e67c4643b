ovl: Fix kernel panic while mounting overlayfs

The function ovl_fill_super() in recently multi-layer support
version will incorrectly return 0 at error handling path and
then cause kernel panic.

This failure can be reproduced by mounting a overlayfs with
upperdir and workdir in different mounts.

And also, If the memory allocation of *lower_mnt* fail, this
function may return an zero either.

This patch fix this problem by setting *err* to proper error
number before jumping to error handling path.
