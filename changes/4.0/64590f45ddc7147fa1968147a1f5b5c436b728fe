md: make merge_bvec_fn more robust in face of personality changes.

There is no locking around calls to merge_bvec_fn(), so
it is possible that calls which coincide with a level (or personality)
change could go wrong.

So create a central dispatch point for these functions and use
rcu_read_lock().
If the array is suspended, reject any merge that can be rejected.
If not, we know it is safe to call the function.
