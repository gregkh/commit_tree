net: Do not call ndo_dflt_fdb_dump if ndo_fdb_dump is defined

Add checking whether the call to ndo_dflt_fdb_dump is needed.
It is not expected to call ndo_dflt_fdb_dump unconditionally
by some drivers (i.e. qlcnic or macvlan) that defines
own ndo_fdb_dump. Other drivers define own ndo_fdb_dump
and don't want ndo_dflt_fdb_dump to be called at all.
At the same time it is desirable to call the default dump
function on a bridge device.
Fix attributes that are passed to dev->netdev_ops->ndo_fdb_dump.
Add extra checking in br_fdb_dump to avoid duplicate entries
as now filter_dev can be NULL.

Following tests for filtering have been performed before
the change and after the patch was applied to make sure
they are the same and it doesn't break the filtering algorithm.
