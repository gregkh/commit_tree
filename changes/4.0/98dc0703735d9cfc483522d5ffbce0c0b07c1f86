Input: synaptics - add quirk for Thinkpad E440

Its ClickPad shares PNP ID "LEN2006" with the one in model E540 which is
already handled by the driver (both are Haswell iterations of the Edge
line, launched in 2014) but the dimensions it reports are different:

  $ sudo ./touchpad-edge-detector /dev/input/event3
  Touchpad SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on /dev/input/event3
  Move one finger around the touchpad to detect the actual edges
  Kernel says: x [1472..5044], y [1408..3398]
  Touchpad sends: x [1024..5045], y [2457..4832] /^C

Fortunately we can use the board ID, which is also different, to
distinguish among them.

  $ dmesg | grep -i synaptics
