drm/i915: Make sure the primary plane is enabled before reading out the fb state

We don't want to end up in a state where we track that the pipe has its
primary plane enabled when primary plane registers are programmed with
values that look possible but the plane actually disabled.

Refuse to read out the fb state when the primary plane isn't enabled.
