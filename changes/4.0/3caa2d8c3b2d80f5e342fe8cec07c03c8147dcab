arm/arm64: KVM: make the maximum number of vCPUs a per-VM value

Currently the maximum number of vCPUs supported is a global value
limited by the used GIC model. GICv3 will lift this limit, but we
still need to observe it for guests using GICv2.
So the maximum number of vCPUs is per-VM value, depending on the
GIC model the guest uses.
Store and check the value in struct kvm_arch, but keep it down to
8 for now.
