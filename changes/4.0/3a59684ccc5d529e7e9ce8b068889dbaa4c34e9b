Input: ti_am335x_tsc - interchange touchscreen and ADC steps

This patch makes the initial changes required to workaround TSC-false
pen-up interrupts. It is required to implement these changes in order to
remove udelay in the TSC interrupt handler and false pen-up events.  The
charge step is to be executed immediately after sampling X+. Hence TSC is
made to use higher numbered steps (steps 5 to 16 for 5 co-ordinate
readouts, 4 wire TSC configuration) and ADC to use lower ones. Further X
co-ordinate readouts must be the last to be sampled, thus co-ordinates are
sampled in the order Y-Z-X.
