livepatch: kernel: add TAINT_LIVEPATCH

This adds a new taint flag to indicate when the kernel or a kernel
module has been live patched.  This will provide a clean indication in
bug reports that live patching was used.

Additionally, if the crash occurs in a live patched function, the live
patch module will appear beside the patched function in the backtrace.
