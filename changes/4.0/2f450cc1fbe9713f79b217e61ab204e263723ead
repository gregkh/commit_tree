loop/usb/vhost-scsi/xen-scsiback: Fix use of __transport_register_session

This patch changes loopback, usb-gadget, vhost-scsi and xen-scsiback
fabric code to invoke transport_register_session() instead of the
unprotected flavour, to ensure se_tpg->session_lock is taken when
adding new session list nodes to se_tpg->tpg_sess_list.

Note that since these four fabric drivers already hold their own
internal TPG mutexes when accessing se_tpg->tpg_sess_list, and
consist of a single se_session created through configfs attribute
access, no list corruption can currently occur.

So for correctness sake, go ahead and use the se_tpg->session_lock
protected version for these four fabric drivers.
