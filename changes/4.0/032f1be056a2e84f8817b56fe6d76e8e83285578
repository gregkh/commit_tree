s390/smp: remove check for CONFIG_ZFCPDUMP

Commit 725908110a1f ("s390: add SMT support") added a check for
CONFIG_ZFCPDUMP. But the Kconfig symbol ZFCPDUMP was removed in v3.16
through commit bf28a5970de3 ("s390/dump: Remove CONFIG_ZFCPDUMP"). So
this check will always evaluate to false. No one noticed probably
because the code also checks for CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP which "also enables
s390 zfcpdump".

Dump the unneeded check.
