dmaengine: at_xdmac: simplify channel configuration stuff

This patch simplifies the channel configuration register management.
Relying on a "software snapshot" of the configuration is not safe and
too complex.

Multiple dwidths will be introduced for slave transfers. In this case,
it becomes quite difficult to have an accurate snapshot of the channel
configuration register in the way it is done. Using the channel
configuration available in the lli descriptor simplifies this stuff.
