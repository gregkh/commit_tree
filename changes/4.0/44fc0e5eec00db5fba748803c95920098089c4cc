sched/wait: Introduce wait_on_bit_timeout()

Add a new wait_on_bit_timeout() helper, basically the same as
wait_on_bit() except that it also takes a 'timeout' parameter.

All the building blocks like bit_wait_timeout() and
out_of_line_wait_on_bit_timeout() are already in place so the
addition is rather simple.
