mm: add 'foreign' alias for the 'pinned' page flag

The foreign page flag will be used by Xen guests to mark pages that
have grant mappings of frames from other (foreign) guests.

The foreign flag is an alias for the existing (Xen-specific) pinned
flag.  This is safe because pinned is only used on pages used for page
tables and these cannot also be foreign.
