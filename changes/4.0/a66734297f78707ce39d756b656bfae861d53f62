perf/x86: Add /sys/devices/cpu/rdpmc=2 to allow rdpmc for all tasks

While perfmon2 is a sufficiently evil library (it pokes MSRs
directly) that breaking it is fair game, it's still useful, so we
might as well try to support it.  This allows users to write 2 to
/sys/devices/cpu/rdpmc to disable all rdpmc protection so that hack
like perfmon2 can continue to work.

At some point, if perf_event becomes fast enough to replace
perfmon2, then this can go.
