drm/i915: Make i915_pipe_crc_read() oops proof

Currently i915_pipe_crc_read() will drop pipe_crc->lock for the entire
duration of the copy_to_user() loop, which means it'll access
pipe_crc->entries without any protection. If another thread sneaks in
and frees pipe_crc->entries the code will oops.

Reorganize the code to hold the lock around everything except
copy_to_user(). After the copy the lock is reacquired and the the number
of available entries is rechecked.

Since this is a debug feature simplify the error handling a bit by
consuming the crc entry even if copy_to_user() would fail.
