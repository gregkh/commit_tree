iio: mxs-lradc: check ranges of ts properties

The devicetree binding for mxs-lradc defines ranges for the
touchscreen properties. In order to avoid unexpected behavior like
division by zero, we better check these ranges during probe and
abort in error case.

Additionally this patch adds an important note from the reference
manual about the range of sample delay.
