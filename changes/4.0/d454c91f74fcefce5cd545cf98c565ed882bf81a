lpfc: correct device removal deadlock after link bounce

This patch, applicable to 8G/4G/2G adapters, adds a call that
resumes transmit operations after a link bounce. Without it, targets
that tried to suspend exchanges after a link bounce (such as tape devices
using sequence level error recovery) would never resume io operation,
causing scan failures, and eventually deadlocks if a device removal
request is made.
