dev: add per net_device packet type chains

When many pf_packet listeners are created on a lot of interfaces the
current implementation using global packet type lists scales poorly.
This patch adds per net_device packet type lists to fix this problem.

The patch was originally written by Eric Biederman for linux-2.6.29.
Tested on linux-3.16.
