hpsa: change how SA controllers are reset

Change how SA controllers are reset by changing PCI power levels.
The hpsa driver was finding the PCI_PM_CTRL_STATE_MASK offset
then reading/writing a bitmask to change the power state. There
are kernel functions that do the same operations. Better to use
the kernel functions.
