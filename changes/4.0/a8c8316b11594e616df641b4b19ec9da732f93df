HID: do not bind to Microchip Pick16F1454

The Microchip Pick16F1454 is exported as a HID device and is used by for
example the Yepkit YKUSH three-port switchable USB hub. However, it is not an
actual HID-device. On the Yepkit, it is used to power up/down the ports on the
hub. The HID driver should ignore this device.
