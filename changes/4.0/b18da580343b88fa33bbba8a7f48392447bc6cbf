ACPICA: Events: Remove acpi_ev_valid_gpe_event() due to current restriction

ACPICA commit 8823b44ff53859ab24ecfcfd3fba8cc56b17d223

Currently we rely on the logic that GPE blocks will never be deleted,
otherwise we can be broken by the race between acpi_ev_create_gpe_block(),
acpi_ev_delete_gpe_block() and acpi_ev_gpe_detect().
On the other hand, if we want to protect GPE block creation/deletion, we
need to use a different synchronization facility to protect the period
between acpi_ev_gpe_dispatch() and acpi_ev_asynch_enable_gpe(). Which leaves us
no choice but abandoning the ACPI_MTX_EVENTS used during this period.

This patch removes ACPI_MTX_EVENTS used during this period and the
acpi_ev_valid_gpe_event() to reflect current restriction. Lv Zheng.
