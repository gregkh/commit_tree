spi: Only idle the message pump in the worker kthread

In order to avoid the situation where the kthread is waiting for another
context to make the hardware idle let the message pump know if it's being
called from the worker thread context and if it isn't then defer to the
worker thread instead of idling the hardware immediately. This will ensure
that if this situation happens we block rather than busy waiting.
