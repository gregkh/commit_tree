ALSA: dice: fix wrong offsets for Dice interface

For received packet stream, the offset of 'RX_SEQ_START' locates after
the offset of 'RX_NUMBER_MIDI', although current macro and proc output
includes wrong offsets.

Fortunately, this bug doesn't affect streaming functionality because
these macro is not used.

This commit fixes these wrong macro and outputs.
