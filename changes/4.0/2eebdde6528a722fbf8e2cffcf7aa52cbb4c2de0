timecounter: keep track of accumulated fractional nanoseconds

The current timecounter implementation will drop a variable amount
of resolution, depending on the magnitude of the time delta. In
other words, reading the clock too often or too close to a time
stamp conversion will introduce errors into the time values. This
patch fixes the issue by introducing a fractional nanosecond field
that accumulates the low order bits.
