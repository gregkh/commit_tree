drivers/rtc/rtc-isl12057.c: add alarm support to Intersil ISL12057 RTC driver

This patch adds alarm support to Intersil ISL12057 driver.  This allows to
configure the chip to generate an interrupt when the alarm matches current
time value.  Alarm can be programmed up to one month in the future and is
accurate to the second.

The patch was developed to support two different configurations: systems
w/ and w/o RTC chip IRQ line connected to the main CPU.

The latter is the one found on current 3 kernel users of the chip for
which support was initially developed (Netgear ReadyNAS 102, 104 and 2120
NAS).  On those devices, the IRQ#2 pin of the chip is not connected to the
SoC but to a PMIC.  This allows setting an alarm, powering off the device
and have it wake up when the alarm rings.  To support that configuration
the driver does the following:

 1. it has alarm_irq_enable() function returns -ENOTTY when no IRQ
    is passed to the driver.
 2. it marks the device as a wakeup source in all cases (whether an
    IRQ is passed to the driver or not) to have 'wakealarm' sysfs
    entry created.
 3. it marks the device has not supporting UIE mode when no IRQ is
    passed to the driver (see the commmit message of c9f5c7e7a84f)

This specific configuration was tested on a ReadyNAS 102 by setting an
alarm, powering off the device and see it reboot as expected when the
alarm rang.

The former configuration was tested on a Netgear ReadyNAS 102 after some
soldering of the IRQ#2 pin of the RTC chip to a MPP line of the SoC (the
one used usually handles the reset button).  The test was performed using
a modified .dts file reflecting this change (see below) and rtc-test.c
program available in Documentation/rtc.txt.  This test program ran as
expected, which validates alarm supports, including interrupt support.

As a side note, the ISL12057 remains in the list of trivial devices, i.e.
no specific DT binding being added by this patch: i2c core automatically
handles extraction of IRQ line info from .dts file.  For instance, if one
wants to reference the interrupt line for the alarm in its .dts file,
adding interrupt and interrupt-parent properties works as expected:

          isl12057: isl12057@68 {
                  compatible =3D "isil,isl12057";
                  interrupt-parent =3D <&gpio0>;
                  interrupts =3D <6 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
                  reg =3D <0x68>;
          };

FWIW, if someone is looking for a way to test alarm support on a system on
which the chip IRQ line has the ability to boot the system (e.g.  ReadyNAS
102, 104, etc):

    # echo 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
    # echo `date '+%s' -d '+ 1 minutes'` > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
    # shutdown -h now

With the commands above, after a minute, the system comes back to life.
