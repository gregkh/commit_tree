sg: fix EWOULDBLOCK errors with scsi-mq

With scsi-mq enabled, userspace programs can get unexpected EWOULDBLOCK
(a.k.a. EAGAIN) errors when submitting commands to the SCSI generic
driver.  Fix by calling blk_get_request() with GFP_KERNEL instead of
GFP_ATOMIC.

Note: to avoid introducing a potential deadlock, this patch should be
applied after the patch titled "sg: fix unkillable I/O wait deadlock
with scsi-mq".
