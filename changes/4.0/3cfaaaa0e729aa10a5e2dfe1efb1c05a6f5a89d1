ASoC: magician: Automatically disconnect non-connected pins

All DAPM input and output pins of the uda1380 are either used in the card's
DAPM routing table or are marked as not connected.

Set the fully_routed flag of the card instead of manually marking the unused
inputs and outputs as not connected. This makes the code a bit shorter and
cleaner.
