iwlwifi: mvm: change SMEM dump to general purpose memory dump

Instead of adding a dump type for each type of memory, change
the SMEM type to be a general purpose memory dump. Add the
type of the memory and its offset in the device in the dump
itself. This will allow an external parser to know where
this memory came from.

Note that since this type isn't really in use yet, this is
not a real problem.
