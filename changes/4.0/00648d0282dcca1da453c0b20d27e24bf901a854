tty: serial: 8250: omap: add ttySx console if the user didn't

This patch invokes add_preferred_console() with ttyS based on ttyO
arguments if the user didn't specify it on its own. This ensures that
the user will see the kernel booting on his serial console in case he
forgot to update the command line.
