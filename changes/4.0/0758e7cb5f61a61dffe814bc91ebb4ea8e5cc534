i40evf: kick a stalled admin queue

On some versions of the firmware, the VF admin send queue may become
stalled. In this case, the easiest solution is to just place another
descriptor on the queue; the firmware will then process both requests.

The early init code already accounts for this, but the runtime code does
not. In the watchdog task, check for the stall condition, and if it's
found, send our API version to the PF. When the PF replies, just ignore
the reply.
