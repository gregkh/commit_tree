vt6655: Fix late setting of byRFType.

byRFType is not set prior to registration of mac80211 causing
unpredictable operation after channel scans.

With byRFType unset all channels are enabled this causes tx power
to be set to values not present its eeprom.

Move setting of this variable to vt6655_probe.

byRFType must have a mask set. byRevId not used by driver and
is removed.
