KVM: nVMX: Make nested control MSRs per-cpu

To enable nested apicv support, we need per-cpu vmx
control MSRs:
  1. If in-kernel irqchip is enabled, we can enable nested
     posted interrupt, we should set posted intr bit in
     the nested_vmx_pinbased_ctls_high.
  2. If in-kernel irqchip is disabled, we can not enable
     nested posted interrupt, the posted intr bit
     in the nested_vmx_pinbased_ctls_high will be cleared.

Since there would be different settings about in-kernel
irqchip between VMs, different nested control MSRs
are needed.
