ALSA: fireworks/bebob/dice/oxfw: add reference-counting for FireWire unit

Fireworks and Dice drivers try to touch instances of FireWire unit after
sound card object is released, while references to the unit is decremented
in .remove(). When unplugging during streaming, sound card object is
released after .remove(), thus Fireworks and Dice drivers causes GPF or
Null-pointer-dereferencing to application processes because an instance of
FireWire unit was already released.

This commit adds reference-counting for FireWire unit in drivers to allow
them to touch an instance of FireWire unit after .remove(). In most case,
any operations after .remove() may be failed safely.
