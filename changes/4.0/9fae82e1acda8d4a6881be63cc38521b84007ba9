i2c: cadence: Handle > 252 byte transfers

The I2C controller sends a NACK to the slave when transfer size register
reaches zero, irrespective of the hold bit. So, in order to handle transfers
greater than 252 bytes, the transfer size register has to be maintained at a
value >= 1. This patch implements the same.
The interrupt status is cleared at the beginning of the isr instead of
the end, to avoid missing any interrupts.
