HID: wacom: peport In Range event according to the spec

Some Cintiq and Intuos tablets report In Range event. This event is sent before
valid data is reported when tool enters proximity; or before out of proximity
event is reported when tool exits.

While entering proximity, In Range means a pen is detected. This information
can be used for palm/touch rejection on both pen and touch enabled devices.
While exiting, it means the tool has reached its maximum detectable distance.
