ktest: Restore tty settings after closing console

When ktest runs the console program as a child process, the parent and
child share the same tty for stdin and stderr.  This is problematic when
using a libvirt target.  The "virsh console" program makes a lot of
changes to the tty settings, making ktest's output hard to read
(carriage returns don't work).  After ktest exits, the terminal is
unusable (CRs broken, stdin isn't echoed).

I think the best way to fix this issue would be to create a
pseudoterminal (pty pair) so the child process would have a dedicated
tty, and then use pipes to connect the two ttys.  I'm not sure if that's
overkill, but it's far beyond my current Perl abilities.

This patch is a much easier way to (partially) fix this issue.  It saves
the tty settings before opening the console and restores them after
closing it.  There are still a few places where ktest prints mangled
output while the console is open, but the output is much more legible
overall, and the terminal works just fine after ktest exits.
