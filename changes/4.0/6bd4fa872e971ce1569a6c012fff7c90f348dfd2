staging: comedi: ni_tiocmd: change comedi "driver" comment to "module"

This module contains support code for some other comedi drivers, but
isn't a comedi driver itself, so doesn't need a comedi "driver" comment.
To preserve the details in the original comment, change it into a comedi
"module" comment (which I've just invented) by changing the "Driver:"
line into a "Module:" line and removing the "Devices:" line.

Also reformat it to use the usual block comment style.
