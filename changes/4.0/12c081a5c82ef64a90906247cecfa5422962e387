fib_trie: inflate/halve nodes in a more RCU friendly way

This change pulls the node_set_parent functionality out of put_child_reorg
and instead leaves that to the function to take care of as well.  By doing
this we can fully construct the new cluster of tnodes and all of the
pointers out of it before we start routing pointers into it.

I am suspecting this will likely fix some concurency issues though I don't
have a good test to show as such.
