ARM: mvebu: use arm_coherent_dma_ops and re-enable hardware I/O coherency

Now that we have enabled automatic I/O synchronization barriers, we no
longer need any explicit barriers. We can therefore simplify
arch/arm/mach-mvebu/coherency.c by using the existing
arm_coherent_dma_ops instead of our custom mvebu_hwcc_dma_ops, and
re-enable hardware I/O coherency support.
