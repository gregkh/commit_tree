dts: Documentation: AT91 Watchdog, explain what atmel,idle-halt property really do

atmel,idle-halt property should be used with care, it actually makes the
watchdog not counting when the CPU is in idle state, therefore the
watchdog reset time depends on mean CPU usage and will not reset at all
of the CPU stop working while it is in idle state, which is probably not
what you want.
