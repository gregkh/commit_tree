[media] s5p-mfc-v6+: Use display_delay_enable CID

The MFC driver has two controls, DISPLAY_DELAY and DISPLAY_DELAY_ENABLE
that allow forcing the decoder to return a decoded frame sooner
regardless of the order. The added support for firmware version 6 and
higher was not taking into account the DISPLAY_DELAY_ENABLE boolean.
Instead it had a comment stating that DISPLAY_DELAY should be set to a
negative value to disable it. This is not possible since the control
range is from 0 to 65535. This feature was also supposed to be disabled
by default in order to produce frames in display order.
