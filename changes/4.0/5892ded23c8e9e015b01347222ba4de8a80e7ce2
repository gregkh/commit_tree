regmap: Fix i2c word access when using SMBus access functions

SMBus access functions assume that 16-bit values are formatted as
little endian numbers. The direct i2c access functions in regmap,
however, assume that 16-bit values are formatted as big endian numbers.
As a result, the current code returns different values if an i2c chip's
16-bit registers are accessed through i2c access functions vs. SMBus
access functions.

Use regmap_smbus_read_word_swapped and regmap_smbus_write_word_swapped
for 16-bit SMBus accesses if a chip is configured as REGMAP_ENDIAN_BIG.
If the chip is configured as REGMAP_ENDIAN_LITTLE, keep using
regmap_smbus_write_word_data and regmap_smbus_read_word_data. Otherwise
reject registration if the controller does not support direct i2c accesses.
