i2c: ocores: fix clock-frequency binding usage

clock-frequency property is meant to control the bus frequency for i2c bus
drivers, but it was incorrectly used to specify i2c controller input clock
frequency.
Introduce new attribute, opencores,ip-clock-frequency, that specifies i2c
controller clock frequency and make clock-frequency attribute compatible
with other i2c drivers. Maintain backwards compatibility in case
opencores,ip-clock-frequency attribute is missing.
