drm/i915: Ensure the HiZ RAW Stall Optimization is on for Cherryview.

This is an important optimization for avoiding read-after-write (RAW)
stalls in the HiZ buffer.  Certain workloads would run very slowly with
HiZ enabled, but run much faster with the "hiz=false" driconf option.
With this patch, they run at full speed even with HiZ.

Increases performance in OglVSInstancing by about 2.7x on Braswell.
