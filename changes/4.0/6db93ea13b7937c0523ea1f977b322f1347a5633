udp: Set SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL* in UDP GRO path

Properly set GSO types and skb->encapsulation in the UDP tunnel GRO
complete so that packets are properly represented for GSO. This sets
SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL or SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM depending on whether
non-zero checksums were received, and sets SKB_GSO_TUNNEL_REMCSUM if
the remote checksum option was processed.
