spi: dw-mid: clear BUSY flag fist and test other one

The logic of DMA completion is broken now since test_and_clear_bit() never
returns the other bit is set. It means condition are always false and we have
spi_finalize_current_transfer() called per each DMA completion which is wrong.

The patch fixes logic by clearing BUSY bit first and then check for the other
one.
