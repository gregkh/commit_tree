lib/halfmd4.c: simplify includes

We only need EXPORT_SYMBOL, so compiler.h and export.h suffice.  This
means linux/types.h is no longer implicitly included, so add an include of
uapi/linux/types.h to linux/cryptohash.h for __u32.  Other users of
cryptohash.h cannot be affected, since they must already have been
including uapi/linux/types.h in order for gcc not to complain about
unknown types.
