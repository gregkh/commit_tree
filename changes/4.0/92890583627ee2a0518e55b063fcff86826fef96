drm/plane-helper: Skip prepare_fb/cleanup_fb when newfb==oldfb

When commiting a plane update where the framebuffer doesn't change, we
can skip the prepare_fb/cleanup_fb steps.  This also allows us to avoid
an unnecessary vblank wait at the end of the operation when we're just
moving a plane and not changing its image (e.g., for a cursor).

At the moment, i915 is the only upstream driver using the transitional
plane helpers, and thus the only driver affected by this change.

Note that this replicates a corresponding change in the atomic helpers
implemented in
