arm64: kernel: remove ARM64_CPU_SUSPEND config option

ARM64_CPU_SUSPEND config option was introduced to make code providing
context save/restore selectable only on platforms requiring power
management capabilities.

Currently ARM64_CPU_SUSPEND depends on the PM_SLEEP config option which
in turn is set by the SUSPEND config option.

The introduction of CPU_IDLE for arm64 requires that code configured
by ARM64_CPU_SUSPEND (context save/restore) should be compiled in
in order to enable the CPU idle driver to rely on CPU operations
carrying out context save/restore.

The ARM64_CPUIDLE config option (ARM64 generic idle driver) is therefore
forced to select ARM64_CPU_SUSPEND, even if there may be (ie PM_SLEEP)
failed dependencies, which is not a clean way of handling the kernel
configuration option.

For these reasons, this patch removes the ARM64_CPU_SUSPEND config option
and makes the context save/restore dependent on CPU_PM, which is selected
whenever either SUSPEND or CPU_IDLE are configured, cleaning up dependencies
in the process.

This way, code previously configured through ARM64_CPU_SUSPEND is
compiled in whenever a power management subsystem requires it to be
present in the kernel (SUSPEND || CPU_IDLE), which is the behaviour
expected on ARM64 kernels.

The cpu_suspend and cpu_init_idle CPU operations are added only if
CPU_IDLE is selected, since they are CPU_IDLE specific methods and
should be grouped and defined accordingly.

PSCI CPU operations are updated to reflect the introduced changes.
