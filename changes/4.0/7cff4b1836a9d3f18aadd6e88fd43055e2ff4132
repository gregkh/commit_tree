kernfs: handle poll correctly on 'direct_read' files.

Kernfs supports two styles of read: direct_read and seqfile_read.

The latter supports 'poll' correctly thanks to the update of
'->event' in kernfs_seq_show.
The former does not as '->event' is never updated on a read.

So add an appropriate update in kernfs_file_direct_read().

This was noticed because some 'md' sysfs attributes were
recently changed to use direct reads.
