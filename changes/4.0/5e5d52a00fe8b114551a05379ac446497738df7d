[media] rtl2832: remove unneeded software reset from init()

There is no need to do software reset on init() as it is done a bit
later on end of set_frontend(). Software reset usually means
restarting (resetting to starting point) chip internal state machine
(FSM). Naturally it is done after all parameters are programmed.
