drm/amdkfd: Encapsulate KQ functions in ops structure

This patch does some re-org on the kernel_queue structure. It takes out
all the function pointers from the structure and puts them in a new structure,
called kernel_queue_ops. Then, it puts an instance of that structure
inside kernel_queue.

This re-org is done to prepare the KQ module to support more than one AMD APU
(Kaveri).
