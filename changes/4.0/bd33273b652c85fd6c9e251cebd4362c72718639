wil6210: relax spinlocks in rx reorder

In the Rx reorder mechanism, nothing is done in the interrupt
context, so there is no need to use 'irq' flavors of spinlock.
Rx done in NAPI context (tasklet), other manipulations - in the
thread context.

Having interrupts enabled makes it better for the OS in general.
Besides, if enslaved under bonding, bridge or team driver, Rx
won't work with interrupts disabled.
