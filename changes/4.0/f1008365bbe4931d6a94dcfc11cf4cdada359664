slab: use css id for naming per memcg caches

Currently, we use mem_cgroup->kmemcg_id to guarantee kmem_cache->name
uniqueness.  This is correct, because kmemcg_id is only released on css
free after destroying all per memcg caches.

However, I am going to change that and release kmemcg_id on css offline,
because it is not wise to keep it for so long, wasting valuable entries of
memcg_cache_params->memcg_caches arrays.  Therefore, to preserve cache
name uniqueness, let us switch to css->id.
