lib: crc32: constify crc32 lookup table

Commit 8f243af42ade ("sections: fix const sections for crc32 table")
removed the compile-time generated crc32 tables from the RO sections,
because it conflicts with the definition of __cacheline_aligned which
puts all such aligned data into .data..cacheline_aligned section
optimized for wasting less space, and can cause alignment issues when
used in combination with const with some gcc versions like 4.7.0 due to
a gcc bug [1].

Given that most gcc versions should have the fix by now, we can just use
____cacheline_aligned, which only aligns the data but doesn't move it
into specific sections as opposed to __cacheline_aligned.  In case of
gcc versions having the mentioned bug, the alignment attribute will have
no effect, but the data will still be made RO.

After patch tables are in RO:

  $ nm -v lib/crc32.o | grep -1 -E "crc32c?table"
  0000000000000000 t arch_local_irq_enable
  0000000000000000 r crc32ctable_le
  0000000000000000 t crc32_exit
  --
  0000000000000960 t test_buf
  0000000000002000 r crc32table_be
  0000000000004000 r crc32table_le
  000000001d1056e5 A __crc_crc32_be
