Revert "sparc/PCI: Clip bridge windows to fit in upstream windows"

This reverts commit d63e2e1f3df904bf6bd150bdafb42ddbb3257ea8.

David Ahern reported that d63e2e1f3df9 breaks booting on an 8-socket T5
sparc system.  He also verified that the system boots with d63e2e1f3df9
reverted.  Yinghai has some fixes, but they need a little more polishing
than we can do before v4.0.
