phy: Find the right match in devm_phy_destroy()

devm_phy_create() stores the pointer to the new PHY at the address
returned by devres_alloc(). The res parameter passed to devm_phy_match()
is therefore the location where the pointer to the PHY is stored, hence
it needs to be dereferenced before comparing to the match data in order
to find the correct match.
