net: add skb functions to process remote checksum offload

This patch adds skb_remcsum_process and skb_gro_remcsum_process to
perform the appropriate adjustments to the skb when receiving
remote checksum offload.

Updated vxlan and gue to use these functions.

Tested: Ran TCP_RR and TCP_STREAM netperf for VXLAN and GUE, did
not see any change in performance.
