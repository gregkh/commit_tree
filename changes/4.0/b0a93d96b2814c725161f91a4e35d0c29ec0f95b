storvsc: force SPC-3 compliance on win8 and win8 r2 hosts

On win8 and win8 r2 hosts force SPC-3 compliance for MSFT virtual disks.
Ubuntu has been carrying a similar patch outside the tree for a while now.
Starting with win10, the host will support SPC-3 compliance. Based on all
the testing that has been done on win8 and win8 r2 hosts, we are comfortable
claiming SPC-3 compliance on these hosts as well. This will enable TRIM
support on these hosts.
