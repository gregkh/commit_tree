efi: efistub: allow allocation alignment larger than EFI_PAGE_SIZE

On systems with 64 KB pages, it is preferable for UEFI memory map
entries to be 64 KB aligned multiples of 64 KB, because it relieves
us of having to deal with the residues.
So, if EFI_ALLOC_ALIGN is #define'd by the platform, use it to round
up all memory allocations made.
