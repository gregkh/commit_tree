rhashtable: involve rhashtable_lookup_compare_insert routine

Introduce a new function called rhashtable_lookup_compare_insert()
which is very similar to rhashtable_lookup_insert(). But the former
makes use of users' given compare function to look for an object,
and then inserts it into hash table if found. As the entire process
of search and insertion is under protection of per bucket lock, this
can help users to avoid the involvement of extra lock.
