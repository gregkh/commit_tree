arm64: vdso: minor ABI fix for clock_getres

The vdso implementation of clock_getres currently returns 0 (success)
whenever a null timespec is provided by the caller, regardless of the
clock id supplied.

This behavior is incorrect.  It should fall back to syscall when an
unrecognized clock id is passed, even when the timespec argument is
null.  This ensures that clock_getres always returns an error for
invalid clock ids.
