[media] timberdale: do not select TIMB_DMA

The timberdale media driver requires the use of the respective
dma engine driver, but that may not be enabled, causing a
Kconfig warning:

warning: (VIDEO_TIMBERDALE) selects TIMB_DMA which has unmet direct dependencies (DMADEVICES && MFD_TIMBERDALE)

This fixes the dependency by removing the inappropriate 'select'
statement and replacing it with a direct dependency on the
drivers that provide the services this needs.

Fixes: 7155043c2d027 ("[media] enable COMPILE_TEST for media drivers")
