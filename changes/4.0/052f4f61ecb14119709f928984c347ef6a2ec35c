staging: lustre: remove the CFS_HOP() macro

CFS_HOP() is a terrible macro.  It chops the struct member name in half
so that it's not possible to use tools like grep or to search for how
a function pointer is used.

I removed a couple calls to:

	LASSERT(CFS_HOP(hs, put_locked) != NULL);

because they isn't a need for them.  Anyway dereferencing a NULL pointer
generates a pretty good stack trace already without adding extra debug
code.
