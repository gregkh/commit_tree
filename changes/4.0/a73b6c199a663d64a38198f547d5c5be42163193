        perf evlist: Refcount mmaps

        We need to know how many fds are using a perf mmap via
        PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_OUTPUT, so that we can know when to ditch an mmap,
        refcount it.

This commit added 'int refcnt' to struct perf_mmap and the addition makes the
event_copy element no longer 8-byte aligned.

Fix by adding __attribute__((aligned(8))) to the event_copy struct
member.
