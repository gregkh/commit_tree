ALSA: Fix handling of multiple msbits constraints on the same runtime

If the sound card is made up of discrete components, each with their own
driver (e.g. like in the ASoC case), we might end up with multiple msbits
constraint rules installed. Currently this will result in msbits being set
to whatever the last rule set it to.

This patch updates the behavior of the rule to choose the minimum (other
than zero) of all the installed rules.
