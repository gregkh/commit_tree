drm/i915: Add headers to the various render state

intel-gpu-tools now generates the render state with license headers and
the version of i-g-t that generated the files.

A similar patch was previously sent but wasn't actually generated with
the make target so was lacking the i-g-t revision. So here another
version before we totally forget about this.
