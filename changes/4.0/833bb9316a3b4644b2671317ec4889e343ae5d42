ACPICA: Events: Remove duplicated sanity check in acpi_ev_enable_gpe()

ACPICA commit ca10324788bc9bdaf47fa9e51145129c1299144d

This patch deletes a sanity check from acpi_ev_enable_gpe().

This kind of check is already done in
acpi_enable_gpe()/acpi_remove_gpe_handler()/acpi_update_all_gpes() before invoking
acpi_ev_enable_gpe():
1. acpi_enable_gpe(): same check (skip if DISPATCH_NONE) is now implemented.
2. acpi_remove_gpe_handler(): a more strict check (skip if !DISPATCH_HANDLER)
                           is implemented.
3. acpi_update_all_gpes(): a more strict check (skip if DISPATCH_NONE ||
                        DISPATCH_HANDLER || CAN_WAKE)
4. acpi_set_gpe(): since it is invoked by the OSPM driver where the GPE
                 handler is known to be available, such check isn't needed.
So we can simply remove this duplicated check from acpi_ev_enable_gpe().
