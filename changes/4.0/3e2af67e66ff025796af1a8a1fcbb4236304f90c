quota: Add ->quota_{enable,disable} callbacks for VFS quotas

Add functions which translate ->quota_enable / ->quota_disable calls
into appropriate changes in VFS quota. This will enable filesystems
supporting VFS quota files in system inodes to be controlled via
Q_XQUOTA[ON|OFF] quotactls for better userspace compatibility.

Also provide a vector for quotactl using these functions which can be
used by filesystems with quota files stored in hidden system files.
