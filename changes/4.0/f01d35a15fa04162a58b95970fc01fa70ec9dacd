gadgetfs: use-after-free in ->aio_read()

AIO_PREAD requests call ->aio_read() with iovec on caller's stack, so if
we are going to access it asynchronously, we'd better get ourselves
a copy - the one on kernel stack of aio_run_iocb() won't be there
anymore.  function/f_fs.c take care of doing that, legacy/inode.c
doesn't...
