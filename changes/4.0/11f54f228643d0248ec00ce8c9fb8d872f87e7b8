NFC: nci: Add HCI over NCI protocol support

According to the NCI specification, one can use HCI over NCI
to talk with specific NFCEE. The HCI network is viewed as one
logical NFCEE.
This is needed to support secure element running HCI only
firmwares embedded on an NCI capable chipset, like e.g. the
st21nfcb.
There is some duplication between this piece of code and the
HCI core code, but the latter would need to be abstracted even
more to be able to use NCI as a logical transport for HCP packets.
