mmc: pwrseq: Document DT bindings for the simple MMC power sequence

To support SOCs which specifies specific MMC power sequences, document
some MMC DT bindings to be able to describe these hardwares.

Let's also document bindings for a simple MMC power sequence provider,
which purpose is to support a set of common properties between various
SOCs.

In this initial step, let's also document a top level description of
the MMC power sequence and describe the compatible string used for the
simple MMC power sequence provider.

The simple MMC power sequence provider will initially support a reset
GPIO. From several earlier posted patches, it's clear that such
hardware exists. Especially some WLAN chips which are attached to an
SDIO interface may use a GPIO reset.
