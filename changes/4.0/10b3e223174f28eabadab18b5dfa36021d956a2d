dmaengine: k3: fix duplicate function definition

Commit db08425ebd51f ("dmaengine: k3: Split device_control") introduced
two new helper functions, which unfortunately have the same names
as the existing suspend/resume functions, resulting in a build error
when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled:

drivers/dma/k3dma.c:823:12: error: conflicting types for 'k3_dma_resume'
 static int k3_dma_resume(struct device *dev)
            ^
drivers/dma/k3dma.c:625:12: note: previous definition of 'k3_dma_resume' was here
 static int k3_dma_resume(struct dma_chan *chan)
            ^
