xfs: report proper f_files in statfs if we overshoot imaxpct

Normally, a statfs syscall reports m_maxicount as f_files
(total file nodes in file system) because it is supposed
to be the upper limit for dynamically-allocated inodes.

It's possible, however, to overshoot imaxpct / m_maxicount.
If this happens, we should report the actual number of allocated
inodes, which is contained in sb_icount.  Add one more adjustment
to the statfs code to make this happen.
