team: fix possible null pointer dereference in team_handle_frame

Currently following race is possible in team:

CPU0                                        CPU1
                                            team_port_del
                                              team_upper_dev_unlink
                                                priv_flags &= ~IFF_TEAM_PORT
team_handle_frame
  team_port_get_rcu
    team_port_exists
      priv_flags & IFF_TEAM_PORT == 0
    return NULL (instead of port got
                 from rx_handler_data)
                                              netdev_rx_handler_unregister

The thing is that the flag is removed before rx_handler is unregistered.
If team_handle_frame is called in between, team_port_exists returns 0
and team_port_get_rcu will return NULL.
So do not check the flag here. It is guaranteed by netdev_rx_handler_unregister
that team_handle_frame will always see valid rx_handler_data pointer.
