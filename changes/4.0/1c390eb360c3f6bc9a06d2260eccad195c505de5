usb: musb: fix Kconfig regression

A recent bug fix I did that was marked for stable backports
introduced a slightly wrong dependency on CONFIG_OMAP_CONTROL_PHY.

I was missing the fact that the PHY driver already stubs out the
omap_control_usb_set_mode, and we only need to add a dependency
to prevent the musb-omap2430 driver from being built-in when
the phy driver is a loadable module, but we should not prevent it
from being built altogether when the phy driver is disabled.
