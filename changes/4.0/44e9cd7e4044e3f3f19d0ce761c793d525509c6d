iwlwifi: mvm: set max_out_time equal to frag_passive_dwell in fragmented scan

Fragmented scan should be applied for all channels, passive and active.
When scanning on passive channels the firmware uses frag_passive_dwell
to define the maximum continuous scan time before returning to the
operating channel. On active channels max_out_time is the parameter
used by the firmware to define the maximum time allowed out of the
operating channel. Since active channels' scan should also be fragmented
set max_out_time equal to frag_passive_dwell.
In addition:
- Set max_out_time and suspend_time if the firmware doesn't support
  fragmented scan to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Adjust max_out_time for second level of scan precedence.
