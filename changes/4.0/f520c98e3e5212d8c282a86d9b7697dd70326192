rculist: Fix sparse warning

This fixes the following sparse warnings:

make C=1 CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ net/ipv6/addrconf.o
net/ipv6/addrconf.c:3495:9: error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)
net/ipv6/addrconf.c:3495:9: error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)
net/ipv6/addrconf.c:3495:9: error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)
net/ipv6/addrconf.c:3495:9: error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)

To silence these spare complaints, an RCU annotation should be added to
"next" pointer of hlist_node structure through hlist_next_rcu() macro
when iterating over a hlist with hlist_for_each_entry_continue_rcu_bh().

By the way, this commit also resolves the same error appearing in
hlist_for_each_entry_continue_rcu().
