drm/i915: Don't do posting reads on getting forcewake

The checking for ack and also any subsequent mmio access
will serialize with setting the forcewake bit. Drop the
posting read as superfluous.

Note that in the put side we still want to keep the posting read
as it will ensure that the hw sees our forcewake release in a
timely manner and doesn't keep the hw powered up.

Note that we kept the once associated with #52424, but judging by my
comments in #51738 the posting read is just a band aid anyway as a full
mb() itself was not adequate.
