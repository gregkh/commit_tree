target: Fix virtual LUN=0 target_configure_device failure OOPs

This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference triggered by a late
target_configure_device() -> alloc_workqueue() failure that results
in target_free_device() being called with DF_CONFIGURED already set,
which subsequently OOPses in destroy_workqueue() code.

Currently this only happens at modprobe target_core_mod time when
core_dev_setup_virtual_lun0() -> target_configure_device() fails,
and the explicit target_free_device() gets called.

To address this bug originally introduced by commit 0fd97ccf45, go
ahead and move DF_CONFIGURED to end of target_configure_device()
code to handle this special failure case.
