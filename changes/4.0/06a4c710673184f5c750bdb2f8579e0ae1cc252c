serial: 8250: Refactor XR17V35X divisor calculation

Exar XR17V35X PCIe uarts support a 4-bit fractional divisor register.
Refactor the divisor calculation from the divisor programming.

Allow a fractional result from serial8250_get_divisor() and pass this
result to serial8250_dl_write().

Simplify the calculation for quot and quot_frac. This was verified
to be identical to the results of the original calculation with a test
jig.

NB: The results were also compared with the divisor value chart
on pg 33 of the Exar XR17V352 datasheet, rev 1.0.3, here:
http://www.exar.com/common/content/document.ashx?id=1585
which differs from the calculated values by 1 in the fractional result.
This is because the calculated values are still rounded in the
fractional result, whereas the table values are truncated. Note
that the data error rate % values in the datasheet are for
rounded fractional results, as the truncated fractional results
have more error.
