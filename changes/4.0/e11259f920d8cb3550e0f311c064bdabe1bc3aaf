NFSv4.1: Clear the old state by our client id before establishing a new lease

If the call to exchange-id returns with the EXCHGID4_FLAG_CONFIRMED_R flag
set, then that means our lease was established by a previous mount instance.
Ensure that we detect this situation, and that we clear the state held by
that mount.
