arm64/efi: handle potential failure to remap memory map

When remapping the UEFI memory map using ioremap_cache(), we
have to deal with potential failure. Note that, even if the
common case is for ioremap_cache() to return the existing linear
mapping of the memory map, we cannot rely on that to be always the
case, e.g., in the presence of a mem= kernel parameter.

At the same time, remove a stale comment and move the memmap code
together.
