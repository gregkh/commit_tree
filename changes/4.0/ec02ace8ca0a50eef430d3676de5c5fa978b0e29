clk: Only recalculate the rate if needed

We don't really need to recalculate the effective rate of a clock when a
per-user clock is removed, if the constraints of the later aren't
limiting the requested rate.

This was causing problems with clocks that never had a rate set before,
as rate_req would be zero. Though this could be considered a bug in the
implementation of those clocks, this should be checked somewhere else.
