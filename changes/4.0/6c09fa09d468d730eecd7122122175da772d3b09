tcp: align tcp_xmit_size_goal() on tcp_tso_autosize()

With some mss values, it is possible tcp_xmit_size_goal() puts
one segment more in TSO packet than tcp_tso_autosize().

We send then one TSO packet followed by one single MSS.

It is not a serious bug, but we can do slightly better, especially
for drivers using netif_set_gso_max_size() to lower gso_max_size.

Using same formula avoids these corner cases and makes
tcp_xmit_size_goal() a bit faster.
