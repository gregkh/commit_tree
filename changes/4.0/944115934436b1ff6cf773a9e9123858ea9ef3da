drm/i915: Make sample_c messages go faster on Haswell.

Haswell significantly improved the performance of sampler_c messages,
but the optimization appears to be off by default.  Later platforms
remove this bit, and apparently always enable the optimization.

Improves performance in "Counter Strike: Global Offensive" by 18%
at default settings on Iris Pro.

This may break sampling of paletted formats (P8/A8P8/P8A8).  It's
unclear whether it affects sampling of paletted formats in general,
or just the sample_c message (which is never used).

While libva does have support for using paletted formats (primarily
for OSDs), that support appears to have been broken for at least a
year, so I couldn't observe a regression from this:

I tried to get libva-intel to use paletted formats, and observe a
regression...but the only thing I found that used it was mplayer's OSD
(on screen display).  Even without my patch, the colors were totally
wrong with that, and it's according to a few distro wikis, that's been
the case for over a year.

If libva's code for paletted formats /is/ broken, they could always
add code to disable this bit using the command validator when fixing
it.

Further investigation from Haihao shows that libva mplayer OSD seems
to work at least on his setup (still unclear what's wron with Ken's),
and that it's not affected by this patch. Quoting the discussion
between Haihao and Ken:

You are right, libva driver doesn't use sample_c message.

Thanks for the explanation, it makes sense to me.
