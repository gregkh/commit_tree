ath10k: prevent fw reg dump spam

Originally the explicit fw register dump was added
to wait_for_target_init because interrupts are
masked early during power_up.

Due to some changes in power_up/reset sequences
sometimes when fw crashed ath10k would print the
dump more than once via hif_stop -> warm_reset ->
wait_for_target_init, possibly with different
values each.

Prevent this by doing the explicit fw register
dump only during power_up instead of
wait_for_target_init.
