pagewalk: improve vma handling

Current implementation of page table walker has a fundamental problem in
vma handling, which started when we tried to handle vma(VM_HUGETLB).
Because it's done in pgd loop, considering vma boundary makes code
complicated and bug-prone.

From the users viewpoint, some user checks some vma-related condition to
determine whether the user really does page walk over the vma.

In order to solve these, this patch moves vma check outside pgd loop and
introduce a new callback ->test_walk().
