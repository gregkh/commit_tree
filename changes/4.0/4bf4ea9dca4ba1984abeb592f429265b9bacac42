serial: omap_8250: Fix RTS handling

The OMAP3 UART ignores MCR[1] (ie., UART_MCR_RTS) when in autoRTS
mode (UPF_HARD_FLOW + CRTSCTS). This makes it impossible for either
the serial core or userspace to manually flow control the sender.

Disable autoRTS mode when RTS is lowered and restore the previous
mode when RTS is raised.

Note that the OMAP3 UART provides no mechanism for switching from
autoRTS mode without corrupting incoming data; to access the
necessary register, the line control settings must be set to 8-e-2
and thus any data received during that time will be interpreted with
those settings. This corruption has been observed in practice.
