[media] v4l: Add packed Bayer raw10 pixel formats

These formats are just like 10-bit raw bayer formats that exist already, but
the pixels are not padded to byte boundaries. Instead, the eight high order
bits of four consecutive pixels are stored in four bytes, followed by a byte
of two low order bits of each of the four pixels.
