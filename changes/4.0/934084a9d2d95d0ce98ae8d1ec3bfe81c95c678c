serial: imx: Fix imx_flush_buffer()

When running an userspace program that does a 'tcflush(fd, TCIOFLUSH)' call
we still see the last received character in the URXD register afterwards.

Clear UCR2_SRST bit so that the UART FIFO is flushed properly.

Since UCR2_SRST also resets some UART registers, we need to save and restore
some of them.
