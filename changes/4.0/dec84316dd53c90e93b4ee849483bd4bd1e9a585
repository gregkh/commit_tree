ALSA: fireworks/bebob/dice/oxfw: make it possible to shutdown safely

A part of these drivers, especially BeBoB driver, are programmed to wait
some events. Thus the drivers should not destroy any data in .remove()
context.

This commit moves some destructors from 'struct fw_driver.remove()' to
'struct snd_card.private_free()' to shutdown safely.
