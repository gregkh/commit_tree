drm: Fixup racy refcounting in plane_force_disable

Originally it was impossible to be dropping the last refcount in this
function since there was always one around still from the idr. But in

    drm: Don't grab an fb reference for the idr

we've switched to weak references, broke that assumption but forgot to
fix it up.

Since we still force-disable planes it's only possible to hit this
when racing multiple rmfb with fbdev restoring or similar evil things.
As long as userspace is nice it's impossible to hit the BUG_ON.

But the BUG_ON would most likely be hit from fbdev code, which usually
invovles the console_lock besides all modeset locks. So very likely
we'd never get the bug reports if this was hit in the wild, hence
better be safe than sorry and backport.
