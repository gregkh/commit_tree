ALSA: Add support for wildcard msbits constraints

Currently the msbits constraints requires to specify a specific sample
format width for which the constraint should be applied. But often the
number of most significant bits is not sample format specific, but rather a
absolute limit. E.g. the PCM interface might accept 32-bit and 24-bit
samples, but the DAC has a 16-bit resolution and throws away the LSBs. In
this case for both 32-bit and 24-bit format msbits should be set to 16. This
patch extends snd_pcm_hw_constraint_msbits() so that a wildcard constraint
can be setup that is applied for all formats with a sample width larger than
the specified msbits. Choosing the wildcard constraint is done by setting
the sample width parameter of the function to 0.
