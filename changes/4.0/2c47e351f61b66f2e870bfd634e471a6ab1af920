i40e: catch NVM write semaphore timeout and retry

In some circumstances, a multi-write transaction takes longer than the
default 3 minute timeout on the write semaphore.  If the write failed with
an EBUSY status, this is likely the problem, so here we try to reacquire
the semaphore then retry the write.  We only do one retry, then give up.
