[media] marvell-ccic: MMP_CAMERA no longer builds

The mmp ccic driver expects a platform_data structure that does not exist
in the mainline kernel and presumably was changed in a kernel fork, which
leads to build errors now:

media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c: In function 'mmpcam_calc_dphy':
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:252:15: error: 'struct mmp_camera_platform_data' has no member named 'dphy3_algo'
  switch (pdata->dphy3_algo) {
               ^
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:253:7: error: 'DPHY3_ALGO_PXA910' undeclared (first use in this function)
  case DPHY3_ALGO_PXA910:
       ^
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:253:7: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:257:8: error: 'struct mmp_camera_platform_data' has no member named 'dphy'

This marks the driver as 'BROKEN' but keeps the code around.
Alternatively it could be removed entirely.
