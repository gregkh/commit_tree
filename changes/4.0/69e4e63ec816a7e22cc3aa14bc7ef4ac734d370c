MIPS: Alchemy: Fix cpu clock calculation

The current code uses bits 0-6 of the sys_cpupll register to calculate
core clock speed.  However this is only valid on Au1300, on all earlier
models the hardware only uses bits 0-5 to generate core clock.

This fixes clock calculation on the MTX1 (Au1500), where bit 6 of cpupll
is set as well, which ultimately lead the code to calculate a bogus cpu
core clock and also uart base clock down the line.
