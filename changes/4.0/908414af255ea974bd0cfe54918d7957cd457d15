atmel: Remove open-coded and wrong strcasecmp

The kernel's string library does in fact have strcasecmp, at least
since ded220bd8f08 ("[STRING]: Move strcasecmp/strncasecmp to
lib/string.c"). Moreover, this open-coded version is in fact wrong: If
the strings only differ in their last character, a and b have already
been incremented to point to the terminating NUL bytes, so they would
wrongly be treated as equal.
