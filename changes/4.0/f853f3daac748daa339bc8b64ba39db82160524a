gpu: ipu-v3: Implement use counter for ipu_dc_enable(), ipu_dc_disable()

The functions ipu_dc_enable() and ipu_dc_disable() enable/disable the DC
globally in the IPU_CONF register, but the DC is used by multiple clients
on different DC channels. So make sure to only disable/enable the DC
globally based on a use counter.
