stmmac: pci: introduce Intel Quark X1000 runtime detection

This patch introduces run-time board detection through DMI and MAC-PHY
configuration function used by quark_default_data() during initialization. It
fills up the phy_addr for Galileo and Galileo Gen2 boards to indicate that the
Ethernet MAC controller is or is not connected to any PHY.

The implementation takes into consideration for future expansion in Quark
series boards that may have different PHY address that is linked to its MAC
controllers.

This piece of work is derived from Bryan O'Donoghue's initial work for Quark
X1000 enabling.
