lguest: send trap 13 through to userspace.

We copy 7 bytes at eip for userspace's instruction decode; we have to
carefully handle the case where eip is at the end of a page.  We can't
leave this to userspace since kernel has all the page table decode
logic.

The decode logic moves to userspace, basically unchanged.
