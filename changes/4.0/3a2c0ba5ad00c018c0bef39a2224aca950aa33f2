hwrng: use reference counts on each struct hwrng.

current_rng holds one reference, and we bump it every time we want
to do a read from it.

This means we only hold the rng_mutex to grab or drop a reference,
so accessing /sys/devices/virtual/misc/hw_random/rng_current doesn't
block on read of /dev/hwrng.

Using a kref is overkill (we're always under the rng_mutex), but
a standard pattern.

This also solves the problem that the hwrng_fillfn thread was
accessing current_rng without a lock, which could change (eg. to NULL)
underneath it.
