ASoC: Add helper function for changing the DAI link format

For some setups it is necessary to change the DAI link format at runtime.
This patch factors out the code that does the initial static DAI link format
configuration into a separate helper function which can be used board
drivers as well.

This allows board drivers that have to change the DAI link format at runtime
to reuse it instead of having to manually change the format on all DAIs.
