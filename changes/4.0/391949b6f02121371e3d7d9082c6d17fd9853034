spi: trigger trace event for message-done before mesg->complete

With spidev the mesg->complete callback points to spidev_complete.
Calling this unblocks spidev_sync and so spidev_sync_write finishes. As
the struct spi_message just read is a local variable in
spidev_sync_write and recording the trace event accesses this message
the recording is better done first. The same can happen for
spidev_sync_read.

This fixes an oops observed on a 3.14-rt system with spidev activity
after

	echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/spi/enable

.
