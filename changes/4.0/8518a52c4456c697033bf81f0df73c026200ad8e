staging: comedi: vmk80xx: GPCT_RESET is not an (*insn_config) instruction

The data[0] parameter to (*insn_config) functions is the "configuration instruction"
that should be handled. These are defined by the enum configuration_ids in comedi.h.

This driver is currently checking the data[0] value to be INSN_CONFIG_RESET or
GPCT_RESET in order to reset a counter channel. GPCT_RESET is defined as 0x0001
which would match the configuration instruction INSN_CONFIG_DIO_OUTPUT. That doesn't
make any sense for a counter.

Remove GPCT_RESET from the insn_cmd test.
