kdb: Fix a prompt management bug when using | grep

Currently when the "| grep" feature is used to filter the output of a
command then the prompt is not displayed for the subsequent command.
Likewise any characters typed by the user are also not echoed to the
display. This rather disconcerting problem eventually corrects itself
when the user presses Enter and the kdb_grepping_flag is cleared as
kdb_parse() tries to make sense of whatever they typed.

This patch resolves the problem by moving the clearing of this flag
from the middle of command processing to the beginning.
