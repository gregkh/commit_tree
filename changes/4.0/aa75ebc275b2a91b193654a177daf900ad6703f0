mac80211: disable u-APSD queues by default

Some APs experience problems when working with
U-APSD. Decreasing the probability of that
happening by using legacy mode for all ACs but VO
isn't enough.

Cisco 4410N originally forced us to enable VO by
default only because it treated non-VO ACs as
legacy.

However some APs (notably Netgear R7000) silently
reclassify packets to different ACs. Since u-APSD
ACs require trigger frames for frame retrieval
clients would never see some frames (e.g. ARP
responses) or would fetch them accidentally after
a long time.

It makes little sense to enable u-APSD queues by
default because it needs userspace applications to
be aware of it to actually take advantage of the
possible additional powersavings. Implicitly
depending on driver autotrigger frame support
doesn't make much sense.
