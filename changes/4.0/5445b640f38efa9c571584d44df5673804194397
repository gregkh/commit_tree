ARM: 8263/1: EXYNOS: Add .write_sec outer cache callback for L2C-310

Exynos4 SoCs equipped with an L2C-310 cache controller and running under
secure firmware require certain registers of aforementioned IP to be
accessed only from secure mode. This means that SMC calls are required
for certain register writes. To handle this, an implementation of
.write_sec and .configure callbacks is provided by this patch.

[added comment and reworked unconditional call to SMC_CMD_L2X0INVALL]
