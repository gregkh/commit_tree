irqchip: gicv3-its: Zero itt before handling to hardware

Some kind of brain-dead implementations chooses to insert ITEes in
rapid sequence of disabled ITEes, and an un-zeroed ITT will confuse
ITS on judging whether an ITE is really enabled or not. Considering
the implementations are still supported by the GICv3 architecture,
in which ITT is not required to be zeroed before being handled to
hardware, we do the favor in ITS driver.
