watchdog: at91sam9: request the irq with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND

The watchdog interrupt (only used when activating software watchdog)
shouldn't be suspended when entering suspend mode, because it is shared
with a timer device (which request the line with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND) and once
the watchdog "Mode Register" has been written, it cannot be changed (which
means we cannot disable the watchdog interrupt when entering suspend).
