KVM: nVMX: Enable nested virtual interrupt delivery

With virtual interrupt delivery, the hardware lets KVM use a more
efficient mechanism for interrupt injection. This is an important feature
for nested VMX, because it reduces vmexits substantially and they are
much more expensive with nested virtualization.  This is especially
important for throughput-bound scenarios.
