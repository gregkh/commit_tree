ARM: dts: n900: fix i2c bus numbering

With legacy boot i2c buses on Nokia N900 are numbered i2c1, i2c2 and i2c3.
Commit 20b80942ef4e ("ARM: dts: OMAP3+: Add i2c aliases") fixed the
numbering with DT boot, but introduced a regression on N900 - aliases
become i2c0, i2c1 and i2c2. Fix that by providing the correct aliases in
the board dts.
