rhashtable: Introduce rhashtable_walk_*

Some existing rhashtable users get too intimate with it by walking
the buckets directly.  This prevents us from easily changing the
internals of rhashtable.

This patch adds the helpers rhashtable_walk_init/exit/start/next/stop
which will replace these custom walkers.

They are meant to be usable for both procfs seq_file walks as well
as walking by a netlink dump.  The iterator structure should fit
inside a netlink dump cb structure, with at least one element to
spare.
