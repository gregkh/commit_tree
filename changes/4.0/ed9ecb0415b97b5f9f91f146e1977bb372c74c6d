virtio: Don't expose legacy net features when VIRTIO_NET_NO_LEGACY defined.

In particular, the virtio header always has the u16 num_buffers field.
We define a new 'struct virtio_net_hdr_v1' for this (rather than
simply calling it 'struct virtio_net_hdr', to avoid nasty type errors
if some parts of a project define VIRTIO_NET_NO_LEGACY and some don't.

Transitional devices (which can't define VIRTIO_NET_NO_LEGACY) will
have to keep using struct virtio_net_hdr_mrg_rxbuf, which has the same
byte layout as struct virtio_net_hdr_v1.
