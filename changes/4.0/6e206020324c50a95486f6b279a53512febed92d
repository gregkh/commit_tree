clocksource/drivers/sun5i: Fix cpufreq interaction with sched_clock()

The sun5i timer is used as the sched-clock on certain systems, and ever
since we started using cpufreq, the cpu clock (that is one of the
timer's clock indirect parent) now changes as well, along with the
actual sched_clock() rate.

This is not accurate and not desirable.

We can safely remove the sun5i sched-clock on those systems, since we
have other reliable sched_clock() sources in the system.
