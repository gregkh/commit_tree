crypto: algif - Mark sgl end at the end of data

algif_skcipher sends 127 sgl buffers for encryption regardless of how
many buffers acctually have data to process, where the few first with
valid len and the rest with zero len. This is not very eficient.
This patch marks the last one with data as the last one to process.
