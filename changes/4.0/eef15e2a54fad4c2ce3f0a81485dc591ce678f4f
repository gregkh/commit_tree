tty: Remove warning in tty_lock_slave()

Commit 2aff5e2bc62db43e05c814461a08aff0fc2b7fe5 ('tty: Change
tty lock order to master->slave') added a warning which is broken
and unnecessary now that the tty lock has fixed lock subclasses,
added in commit 2febdb632bb96235b94b8fccaf882a78f8f4b2bb
('tty: Preset lock subclass for nested tty locks').
