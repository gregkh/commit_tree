x86_64, entry: Remove the syscall exit audit and schedule optimizations

We used to optimize rescheduling and audit on syscall exit.  Now
that the full slow path is reasonably fast, remove these
optimizations.  Syscall exit auditing is now handled exclusively by
syscall_trace_leave.

This adds something like 10ns to the previously optimized paths on
my computer, presumably due mostly to SAVE_REST / RESTORE_REST.

I think that we should eventually replace both the syscall and
non-paranoid interrupt exit slow paths with a pair of C functions
along the lines of the syscall entry hooks.
