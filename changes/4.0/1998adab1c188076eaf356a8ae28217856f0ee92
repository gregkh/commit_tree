usb: isp1760: add peripheral/device controller chip id

As per the SAF1761 data sheet[0], the DcChipID register represents
the hardware version number (0001h) and the chip ID (1582h) for the
Peripheral Controller.

However as per the ISP1761 data sheet[1], the DcChipID register
represents the hardware version number (0015h) and the chip ID (8210h)
for the Peripheral Controller.

This patch adds support for both the chip ID values.
