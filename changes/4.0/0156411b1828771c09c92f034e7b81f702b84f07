arm64: Implement the compat_sys_call_table in C

Unlike the sys_call_table[], the compat one was implemented in sys32.S
making it impossible to notice discrepancies between the number of
compat syscalls and the __NR_compat_syscalls macro, the latter having to
be defined in asm/unistd.h as including asm/unistd32.h would cause
conflicts on __NR_* definitions. With this patch, incorrect
__NR_compat_syscalls values will result in a build-time error.
