microblaze: define __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED

Microblaze uses custom implementation of PMD folding, but doesn't define
__PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED, which generic code expects to see.  Let's fix it.

Defining __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED will drop out unused __pmd_alloc().  It
also fixes problems with recently-introduced pmd accounting.
