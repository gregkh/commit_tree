sparc: semtimedop() unreachable due to comparison error

A bug was reported that the semtimedop() system call was always
failing eith ENOSYS.

Since SEMCTL is defined as 3, and SEMTIMEDOP is defined as 4,
the comparison "call <= SEMCTL" will always prevent SEMTIMEDOP
from getting through to the semaphore ops switch statement.

This is corrected by changing the comparison to "call <= SEMTIMEDOP".
