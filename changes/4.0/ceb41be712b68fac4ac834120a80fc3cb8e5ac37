staging: comedi: pcl816: fix short DMA transactions

When the cmd->stop_src == TRIG_COUNT the last DMA transfer might be smaller
than the buffer size. This results in invalid data being added to the async
buffer.

Add a 'size' member to the DMA descriptor and initialize it with the
actual size of the DMA transfer. Use that in interrupt and ai subdevice
(*poll) function to return the proper number of samples. Use the
comedi_bytes_to_samples() helper to convert the byte size to comedi
samples in the interrupt handler.
