ARM: 8269/1: Remove DEBUG_LL_UART_NONE

Only a very small handful of platforms support DEBUG_LL_UART_NONE but it
lurks in the menus of every single platform config ready to break the
build. This is an especial problem for defconfig/oldconfig since it is
often selected by default.

This patch solves the problem by removing this option. Any platforms
still depending upon this option must be migrated.
