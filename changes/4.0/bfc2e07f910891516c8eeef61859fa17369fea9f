tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: terminate DMA on buffer flush

On uart buffer flush, serial core resets the circular buffer.
If a DMA transfer is in progress at that time, the callback
lpuart_dma_tx_complete will move buffer's tail unconditionally,
hence tail moves beyond head. Use the flush_buffer hook to
terminate the DMA imeaditely and avoid lpuart_dma_tx_complete
being called in this situation.

This bug often showed up while shutdown and lead to duplicate
serial console output.
