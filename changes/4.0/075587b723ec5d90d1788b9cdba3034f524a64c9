ALSA: line6: Handle impulse response via control API

Instead of sysfs and the conditional build with Kconfig, implement the
handling of the impulse response controls via control API, and always
enable the build.  Two new controls, "Impulse Response Volume" and
"Impulse Response Period" are added as a replacement for the former
sysfs files.
