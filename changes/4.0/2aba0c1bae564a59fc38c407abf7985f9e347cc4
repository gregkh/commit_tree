cpufreq: stats: pass 'stat' to cpufreq_stats_update()

It is better to pass a struct cpufreq_stats pointer to cpufreq_stats_update()
instead of a CPU number, because that's all it needs.

Even if we pass a cpu number to cpufreq_stats_update(), it reads the per-cpu
variable to get 'stats' out of it. So we are doing these operations
unnecessarily:
- First getting the cpu number to pass to cpufreq_stats_update(), stat->cpu.
- And then getting stats from the cpu, per_cpu(cpufreq_stats_table, cpu).
