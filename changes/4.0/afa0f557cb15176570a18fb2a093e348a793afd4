md: rename ->stop to ->free

Now that the ->stop function only frees the private data,
rename is accordingly.

Also pass in the private pointer as an arg rather than using
mddev->private.  This flexibility will be useful in level_store().

Finally, don't clear ->private.  It doesn't make sense to clear
it seeing that isn't what we free, and it is no longer necessary
to clear ->private (it was some time ago before  ->to_remove was
introduced).

Setting ->to_remove in ->free() is a bit of a wart, but not a
big problem at the moment.
