staging: rtl8192e: rejoin split quoted strings

Fix a checkpatch.pl warning regarding quoted string splits across lines.
While each join of these quoted strings results in a new checkpatch.pl
"lines over 80 characters" warning, the regained ability to grep for
these log strings in the codebase is, I would argue, well worth the
trade-off.
