drm/i915: Prevent use-after-free in invalidate_range_start callback

It's possible for invalidate_range_start mmu notifier callback to race
against userptr object release. If the gem object was released prior to
obtaining the spinlock in invalidate_range_start we're hitting null
pointer dereference.
