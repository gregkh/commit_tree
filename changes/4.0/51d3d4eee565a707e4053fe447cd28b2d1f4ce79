[media] bw/c-qcam, w9966, pms: remove deprecated staging drivers

These drivers haven't been tested in a long, long time. The hardware is
ancient and hopelessly obsolete. These drivers also need to be converted
to newer media frameworks but due to the lack of hardware that's going
to be impossible. In addition, cheaper and vastly better hardware is
available today.

These drivers are already deprecated, so now remove them altogether.
