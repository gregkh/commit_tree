f2fs: support norecovery mount option

This patch adds a mount option, norecovery, which is mostly same as
disable_roll_forward. The only difference is that norecovery should be activated
with read-only mount option.

This can be used when user wants to check whether f2fs is mountable or not
without any recovery process. (e.g., xfstests/200)
