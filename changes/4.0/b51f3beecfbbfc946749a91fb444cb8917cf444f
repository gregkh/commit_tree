cfg80211: change bandwidth reporting to explicit field

For some reason, we made the bandwidth separate flags, which
is rather confusing - a single rate cannot have different
bandwidths at the same time.

Change this to no longer be flags but use a separate field
for the bandwidth ('bw') instead.

While at it, add support for 5 and 10 MHz rates - these are
reported as regular legacy rates with their real bitrate,
but tagged as 5/10 now to make it easier to distinguish them.

In the nl80211 API, the flags are preserved, but the code
now can also clearly only set a single one of the flags.
