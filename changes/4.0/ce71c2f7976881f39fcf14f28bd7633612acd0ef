iwlwifi: mvm: enable watchdog on Tx queues for mvm

This watchdog allows to monitor the transmit queues. When a
queue doesn't progress for a too long time, a timer fires
and then, debug data can be collected.
This watchdog has never been enabled on dvm controlled
devices, so don't enable it there.
In order to have it running on mvm controlled devices, we
need to fix a small issue in the transport layer: mvm
controlled devices use the shadow registers optimization.
In this case, the watchdog wasn't running at all, even if
enabled by the module parameter. Fix that on the way.
