arm64: psci: move psci firmware calls out of line

An arm64 allmodconfig fails to build with GCC 5 due to __asmeq
assertions in the PSCI firmware calling code firing due to mcount
preambles breaking our assumptions about register allocation of function
arguments:

  /tmp/ccDqJsJ6.s: Assembler messages:
  /tmp/ccDqJsJ6.s:60: Error: .err encountered
  /tmp/ccDqJsJ6.s:61: Error: .err encountered
  /tmp/ccDqJsJ6.s:62: Error: .err encountered
  /tmp/ccDqJsJ6.s:99: Error: .err encountered
  /tmp/ccDqJsJ6.s:100: Error: .err encountered
  /tmp/ccDqJsJ6.s:101: Error: .err encountered

This patch fixes the issue by moving the PSCI calls out-of-line into
their own assembly files, which are safe from the compiler's meddling
fingers.
