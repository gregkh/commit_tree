staging: Remove the Android alarm-dev driver

The functionality provided by the Android alarm-dev driver
should now be present in the timerfd interface (thanks to
Greg Hackmann and Todd Poynor).

As of Lollipop, AOSP can make use of the timerfd if
alarm-dev is not present (though a fixup for setting the
rtc time if rtc0 isn't the backing for _ALARM clockids has
been applied post-Lollipop).

Thus, we should be able to remove alarm-dev from staging.
