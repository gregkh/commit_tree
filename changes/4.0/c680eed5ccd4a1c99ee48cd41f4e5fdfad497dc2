i2c: do not try to load modules for of-registered devices

Trying to register an I2C device asynchronously (via async_schedule() call)
results in an ugly warning from request_module() warning about potential
deadlock (because request_module tries to wait for async works to
complete). While we could try to switch to request_module_nowait(), other
buses, as well as I2C itself when not using device tree, do not try to load
modules, but rather rely on the standard infrastructure (udev) to execute
module loading, and we should be doing the same.
