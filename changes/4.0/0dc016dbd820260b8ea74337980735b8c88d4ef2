ARM: kprobes: enable OPTPROBES for ARM 32

This patch introduce kprobeopt for ARM 32.

Limitations:
 - Currently only kernel compiled with ARM ISA is supported.

 - Offset between probe point and optinsn slot must not larger than
   32MiB. Masami Hiramatsu suggests replacing 2 words, it will make
   things complex. Futher patch can make such optimization.

Kprobe opt on ARM is relatively simpler than kprobe opt on x86 because
ARM instruction is always 4 bytes aligned and 4 bytes long. This patch
replace probed instruction by a 'b', branch to trampoline code and then
calls optimized_callback(). optimized_callback() calls opt_pre_handler()
to execute kprobe handler. It also emulate/simulate replaced instruction.

When unregistering kprobe, the deferred manner of unoptimizer may leave
branch instruction before optimizer is called. Different from x86_64,
which only copy the probed insn after optprobe_template_end and
reexecute them, this patch call singlestep to emulate/simulate the insn
directly. Futher patch can optimize this behavior.
