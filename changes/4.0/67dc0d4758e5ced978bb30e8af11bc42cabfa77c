vt_buffer: drop console buffer copying optimisations

These two copy to/from VGA memory, however on the Silicon
Motion SMI750 VGA card on a 64-bit system cause console corruption.

This is due to the hw being buggy and not handling a 64-bit transaction
correctly.

We could try and create a 32-bit version of these routines,
but I'm not sure the optimisation is worth much today.
