powerpc/pseries: All events of EPOW_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN must initiate shutdown

The current handling of EPOW_SHUTDOWN_ON_UPS event does not shutdown the
system after logging the message. All the events of EPOW_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN
action code (EPOW_SHUTDOWN_ON_UPS is a part of it) must initiate system
shutdown as per the SPAPR spec. If the LPAR does not shutdown after
receiving this rtas based event, it will expose itself to a forced
abrupt shutdown initiated by the platform firmware. This patch fixes the
situation.
