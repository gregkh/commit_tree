drm/i915: Convert i915_wait_seqno to i915_wait_request

Updated i915_wait_seqno() to take a request structure instead of a seqno value
and renamed it accordingly. Internally, it just pulls the seqno out of the
request and calls on to __wait_seqno() as before. However, all the code further
up the stack is now simplified as it can just pass the request object straight
through without having to peek inside.
