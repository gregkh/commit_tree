rhashtable: Lower/upper bucket may map to same lock while shrinking

Each per bucket lock covers a configurable number of buckets. While
shrinking, two buckets in the old table contain entries for a single
bucket in the new table. We need to lock down both while linking.
Check if they are protected by different locks to avoid a recursive
lock.
