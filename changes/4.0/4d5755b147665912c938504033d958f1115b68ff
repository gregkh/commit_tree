epoll: optimize setting task running after blocking

After waking up a task waiting for an event, we explicitly mark it as
TASK_RUNNING (which is necessary as we do the checks for wakeups as
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE).  Once running and dealing with actually delivering
the events, we're obviously not planning on calling schedule, thus we can
relax the implied barrier and simply update the state with
__set_current_state().
