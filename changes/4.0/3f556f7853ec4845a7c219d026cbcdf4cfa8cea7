btrfs: unify extent buffer allocation api

Make the extent buffer allocation interface consistent.  Cloned eb will
set a valid fs_info.  For dummy eb, we can drop the length parameter and
set it from fs_info.

The built-in sanity checks may pass a NULL fs_info that's queried for
nodesize, but we know it's 4096.
