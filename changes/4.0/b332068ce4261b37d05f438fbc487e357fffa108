net/mlx4_core: Fix mpt_entry initialization in mlx4_mr_rereg_mem_write()

a) Previously, mlx4_mr_rereg_write filled the MPT's start
   and length with the old MPT's values.
   Fixing the initialization to take the new start and length.

b) In addition access flags in mpt_status were initialized instead of
   status due to bad boolean operation. Fixing the operation.

c) Initialization of pd_slave caused a protection error.
   Fix - removing this initialization.

d) In resource_tracker.c: Fixing vf encoding to be one-based.
