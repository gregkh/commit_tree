ACPI: Translate resource into master side address for bridge window resources

Add translation_offset into the result address for bridge window
resources to form the master side address.

Currently acpi_dev_resource_{ext_}address_space() are only used for
devices instead of bridges, so it won't break current users. Later
it will be used to support PCI host bridge drivers.
