ASoC: OMAP: mcbsp: Fix CLKX and CLKR pinmux when used as inputs

This patch fixes faulty behaviour in a setup where the input clock for the
SRG is fed through the CLKR/CLKX pin but the McBSP is configured to be
master (SND_SOC_DAIFMT_CBS_CFS). In that case of course CLKR/CLKX must
not be configured as output pin. Otherwise the input clock is messed up
horribly.

This patch makes it possible to use the CLKR/CLKX pin rather than CLKS to
inject a reference clock in setups where McBSP is master and not both
rx and tx are used. However for this to work it has to be ensured that
set_dai_sysclk() is called after set_dai_fmt().

This was tested on a beagleboard-xm using McBSP1 to drive a i2s DAC through
the tx lines (CLKX,FSX,DX). Using this patch the CLKR pin is used to inject
an external reference clock.
