irqchip: gicv3-its: Fix PROP/PEND and BASE/CBASE confusion

The ITS driver sometime mixes up the use of GICR_PROPBASE bitfields
for the GICR_PENDBASE register, and GITS_BASER for GICR_CBASE.

This does not lead to any observable bug because similar bits are
at the same location, but this just make the code even harder to
understand...

This patch provides the required #defines and fixes the mixup.
