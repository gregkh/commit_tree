net: dsa: fix filling routing table from OF description

According to description in 'include/net/dsa.h', in cascade switches
configurations where there are more than one interconnected devices,
'rtable' array in 'dsa_chip_data' structure is used to indicate which
port on this switch should be used to send packets to that are destined
for corresponding switch.

However, dsa_of_setup_routing_table() fills 'rtable' with port numbers
of the _target_ switch, but not current one.

This commit removes redundant devicetree parsing and adds needed port
number as a function argument. So dsa_of_setup_routing_table() now just
looks for target switch number by parsing parent of 'link' device node.

To remove possible misunderstandings with the way of determining target
switch number, a corresponding comment was added to the source code and
to the DSA device tree bindings documentation file.

This was tested on a custom board with two Marvell 88E6095 switches with
following corresponding routing tables: { -1, 10 } and { 8, -1 }.
