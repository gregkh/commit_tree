clk: sunxi: rewrite sun9i_a80_get_pll4_factors()

The old implementation of sun9i_a80_get_pll4_factors() has several issues,
it checks against 256 / 512 in various places where it should use 255 / 511,
it does the wrong thing for low frequencies which are an even multiple of
6 MHz, e.g. if you ask it for 72 MHz it will result in 144 Mhz, and it does
not take into account that n must be at least 12. Moreover it is quite hard
to read / follow it.

This commit rewrites it to be correct in all cases, and makes it much easier
to follow the code / to read.
