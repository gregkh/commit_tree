fib_trie: Push assignment of child to parent down into inflate/halve

This change makes it so that the assignment of the tnode to the parent is
handled directly within whatever function is currently handling the node be
it inflate, halve, or resize.  By doing this we can avoid some of the need
to set NULL pointers in the tree while we are resizing the subnodes.
