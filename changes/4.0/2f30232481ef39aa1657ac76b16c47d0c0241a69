MAINTAINERS: Update Intel Wired Ethernet Driver info

Update the git tree info with a recent change in tree names.  Also
add our new mailing list created solely for Linux kernel patches
and kernel development, as well as the new patchwork project for
tracking patches.  Lastly update the list of "reviewers" since a
couple of developers have moved on to different projects.

Made an update to the section header so that it is more manageable
going forward as we add new drivers.
