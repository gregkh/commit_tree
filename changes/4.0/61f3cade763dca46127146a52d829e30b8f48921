geneve: Remove workqueue.

The work queue is used only to free the UDP socket upon destruction.
This is not necessary with Geneve and generally makes the code more
difficult to reason about. It also introduces nondeterministic
behavior such as when a socket is rapidly deleted and recreated, which
could fail as the the deletion happens asynchronously.
