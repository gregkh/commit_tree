i40evf: reset on module unload

When the module is being unloaded, don't wait for the PF to politely
handle all of our admin queue requests, as that might take forever with
a lot of VFs enabled. Instead, just stop everything and request a VF
reset.

When the original shutdown code was written, VF resets were unreliable,
so we avoided them. But with production hardware and firmware, and the
1.x PF driver, this is no longer the case.

This fixes a potential multi-minute delay on driver unload, VF disable,
or system shutdown.
