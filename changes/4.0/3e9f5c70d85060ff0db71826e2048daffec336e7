rcu: Don't spawn rcub kthreads on root rcu_node structure

Now that offlining CPUs no longer moves leaf rcu_node structures'
->blkd_tasks lists to the root, there is no way for the root rcu_node
structure's ->blkd_task list to be nonempty, unless the root node is also
the sole leaf node.  This commit therefore refrains from creating an rcub
kthread for the root rcu_node structure unless it is also the sole leaf.
