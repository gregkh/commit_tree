drm/i915: Removed duplicate members from submit_request

Where there were duplicate variables for the tail, context and ring (engine)
in the gem request and the execlist queue item, use the one from the request
and remove the duplicate from the execlist queue item.

Issue: VIZ-4274

v1: Rebase
v2: Fixed build issues. Keep separate postfix & tail pointers as these are
used in different ways. Reinserted missing full tail pointer update.
