block_dev: only write bdev inode on close

Since 018a17bdc865 ("bdi: reimplement bdev_inode_switch_bdi()") the
block device code writes out all dirty data whenever switching the
backing_dev_info for a block device inode.  But a block device inode can
only be dirtied when it is in use, which means we only have to write it
out on the final blkdev_put, but not when doing a blkdev_get.

Factoring out the write out from the bdi list switch prepares from
removing the list switch later in the series.
