[media] adv7180: Add support for the adv7280/adv7281/adv7282

This patch adds support for the adv7280/adv7281/adv7282 devices to the
adv7180 driver. They are very similar to the adv7182, the main difference
from the drivers point of view are some different tuning constants for
improved video performance.
