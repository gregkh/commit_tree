serial: imx: use dma_is_txing to synchronize dma_tx_callback and imx_dma_tx

To synchronize between dma_tx_callback() and imx_dma_tx() use the same
variable, dma_is_txing. This prevents any race between these two functions
and ensures that a new DMA can start only after the first has been
finished.

Before the new DMA can be set up, update the circular buffer logic, first.
Therefore, change dma_is_txing after that update, instead of before.

While doing this, in dma_tx_callback() extend the locking to dma_unmap_sg()
and the update of dma_is_txing.
