f2fs: reuse inode_entry_slab in gc procedure for using slab more effectively

There are two slab cache inode_entry_slab and winode_slab using the same
structure as below:

struct dir_inode_entry {
	struct list_head list;	/* list head */
	struct inode *inode;	/* vfs inode pointer */
};

struct inode_entry {
	struct list_head list;
	struct inode *inode;
};

It's a little waste that the two cache can not share their memory space for each
other.
So in this patch we remove one redundant winode_slab slab cache, then use more
universal name struct inode_entry as remaining data structure name of slab,
finally we reuse the inode_entry_slab to store dirty dir item and gc item for
more effective.
