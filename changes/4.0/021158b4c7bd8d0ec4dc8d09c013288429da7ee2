checkpatch: add types for other OS typedefs

bsd and sysv use different typedefs for unsigned types.

These are in types.h but not in checkpatch, so add them to checkpatch's
ability to know types.

This can avoid false positives for code like:

void foo(void)
{
	int x;
	uint y;

	[...];
}

where checkpatch incorrectly emits a warning for "missing a blank line
after declarations".
