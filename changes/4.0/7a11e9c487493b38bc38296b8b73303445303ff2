ARM: sa1100: Convert PCI to use generic config accessors

Convert the sa1100 nanoengine PCI driver to use the generic config access
functions.

Change accesses from __raw_readX/__raw_writeX to readX/writeX variants.
This removes the spinlock because it is unnecessary.  The config read and
write functions are already protected with a spinlock.
