ipv6: Allow for partial checksums on non-ufo packets

Currntly, if we are not doing UFO on the packet, all UDP
packets will start with CHECKSUM_NONE and thus perform full
checksum computations in software even if device support
IPv6 checksum offloading.

Let's start start with CHECKSUM_PARTIAL if the device
supports it and we are sending only a single packet at
or below mtu size.
