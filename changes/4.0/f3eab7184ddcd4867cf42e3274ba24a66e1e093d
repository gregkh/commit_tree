arm64: percpu: Make this_cpu accessors pre-empt safe

this_cpu operations were implemented for arm64 in:
 5284e1b arm64: xchg: Implement cmpxchg_double
 f97fc81 arm64: percpu: Implement this_cpu operations

Unfortunately, it is possible for pre-emption to take place between
address generation and data access. This can lead to cases where data
is being manipulated by this_cpu for a different CPU than it was
called on. Which effectively breaks the spec.

This patch disables pre-emption for the this_cpu operations
guaranteeing that address generation and data manipulation take place
without a pre-emption in-between.

Fixes: 5284e1b4bc8a ("arm64: xchg: Implement cmpxchg_double")
Fixes: f97fc810798c ("arm64: percpu: Implement this_cpu operations")
