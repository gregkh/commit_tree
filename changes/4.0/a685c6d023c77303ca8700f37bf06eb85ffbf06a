cpufreq: stats: create sysfs group once we are ready

Userspace is free to read value of any file from cpufreq/stats directory once
they are created. __cpufreq_stats_create_table() is creating the sysfs files
first and then allocating resources for them. Though it would be quite difficult
to trigger the racy situation here, but for the sake of keeping sensible code
lets create sysfs entries only after we are ready to go.

This also does some makeup to the routine to make it look better.
