ALSA: bebob: fix to processing in big-endian machine for sending cue

Some M-Audio devices require to receive bootup command just after
powering on, while codes in BeBoB driver doesn't work properly in
big-endian machine because the command should be aligned by
little-endian.

This commit fixes this bug. This fix should go to stable kernel.
