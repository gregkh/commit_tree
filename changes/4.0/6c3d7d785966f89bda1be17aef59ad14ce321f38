ath10k: fix target wakeup timeout

During drv_start/drv_stop stress testing in ARM platform,
sometimes target is taking more that 5ms to wake up. Similar
behaviour also noted during driver load and unload iterations.
On such cases, the wakup duration lies between 5-6ms. Hence
increasing pci wakup timeout 10ms to be more safer. With this
changes, able to complete power down/up >100 iterations without
any issues.
