mtd: map_rom: Support UBI on ROM

UBI needs to know the physical erase block size, even on read-only
devices, since it defines the on-device layout. Use a device-tree
provided value to support previously written UBI on read-only NOR.

UBI also needs a non-zero writebufsize, so we set it to one.

Note: This was implemented because hardware write-protected CFI
      NOR cannot be probed for the physical erase block size.
