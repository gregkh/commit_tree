net/mlx4_core: Port aggregation upper layer interface

Supply interface functions to bond and unbond ports of a mlx4 internal
interfaces. Example for such an interface is the one registered by the
mlx4 IB driver under RoCE.

There are

1. Functions to go in/out to/from bonded mode
2. Function to remap virtual ports to physical ports

The bond_mutex prevents simultaneous access to data that keep status of
the device in bonded mode.

The upper mlx4 interface marks to the mlx4 core module that they
want to be subject for such bonding by setting the MLX4_INTFF_BONDING
flag. Interface which goes to/from bonded mode is re-created.

The mlx4 Ethernet driver does not set this flag when registering the
interface, the IB driver does.
