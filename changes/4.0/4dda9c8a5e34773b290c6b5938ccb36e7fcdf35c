SUNRPC: Set SO_REUSEPORT socket option for TCP connections

When using TCP, we need the ability to reuse port numbers after
a disconnection, so that the NFSv3 server knows that we're the same
client. Currently we use a hack to work around the TCP socket's
TIME_WAIT: we send an RST instead of closing, which doesn't
always work...
The SO_REUSEPORT option added in Linux 3.9 allows us to bind multiple
TCP connections to the same source address+port combination, and thus
to use ordinary TCP close() instead of the current hack.
