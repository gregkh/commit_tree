nfs41: .init_read and .init_write can be called with valid pg_lseg

With pgio refactoring in v3.15, .init_read and .init_write can be
called with valid pgio->pg_lseg. file layout was fixed at that time
by commit c6194271f (pnfs: filelayout: support non page aligned
layouts). But the generic helper still needs to be fixed.
