rds: avoid potential stack overflow

The rds_iw_update_cm_id function stores a large 'struct rds_sock' object
on the stack in order to pass a pair of addresses. This happens to just
fit withint the 1024 byte stack size warning limit on x86, but just
exceed that limit on ARM, which gives us this warning:

net/rds/iw_rdma.c:200:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

As the use of this large variable is basically bogus, we can rearrange
the code to not do that. Instead of passing an rds socket into
rds_iw_get_device, we now just pass the two addresses that we have
available in rds_iw_update_cm_id, and we change rds_iw_get_mr accordingly,
to create two address structures on the stack there.
