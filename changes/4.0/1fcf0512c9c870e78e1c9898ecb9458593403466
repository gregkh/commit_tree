virtio_pci: modern driver

Lightly tested against qemu.

One thing *not* implemented here is separate mappings
for descriptor/avail/used rings. That's nice to have,
will be done later after we have core support.

This also exposes the PCI layout to userspace, and
adds macros for PCI layout offsets:

QEMU wants it, so why not?  Trust, but verify.
