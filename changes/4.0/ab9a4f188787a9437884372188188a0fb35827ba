ARM: dts: sun4i: Add mk802 board

The mk802 is the "classic" Allwinner A10 based hdmi tv-stick, it features
512M or 1G RAM, 4G nand, a mini-hdmi female connector, USB-A receptacle,
mini-usb receptacle (OTG) and USB-wifi. Somewhat unique the mk802 does not
use the AXP209 pmic, it does not have a pmic at all.
