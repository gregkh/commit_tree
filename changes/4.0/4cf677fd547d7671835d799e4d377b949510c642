iwlwifi: allow to define the stuck queue timer per queue

Different queue can have different behavior. While it can be
unacceptable for a certain queue to be stuck for 2 seconds
(e.g. the command queue), it can happen that another queue
will stay stuck for even longer (a queue servicing a power
saving client in GO).
The op_mode can even make the timeout be a function of the
listen interval.
