    ipv6: Select fragment id during UFO segmentation if not set.

Introduced a bug on LE in how ipv6 fragment id is assigned.
This was cought by nightly sparce check:

Resolve the following sparce error:
 net/ipv6/output_core.c:57:38: sparse: incorrect type in assignment
 (different base types)
   net/ipv6/output_core.c:57:38:    expected restricted __be32
[usertype] ip6_frag_id
   net/ipv6/output_core.c:57:38:    got unsigned int [unsigned]
[assigned] [usertype] id

Fixes: 0508c07f5e0c9 (ipv6: Select fragment id during UFO segmentation if not set.)
