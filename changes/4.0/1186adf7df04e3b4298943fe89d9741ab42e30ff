tipc: simplify message forwarding and rejection in socket layer

Despite recent improvements, the handling of error codes and return
values at reception of messages in the socket layer is still confusing.

In this commit, we try to make it more comprehensible. First, we
separate between the return values coming from the functions called
by tipc_sk_rcv(), -those are TIPC specific error codes, and the
return values returned by tipc_sk_rcv() itself. Second, we don't
use the returned TIPC error code as indication for whether a buffer
should be forwarded/rejected or not; instead we use the buffer pointer
passed along with filter_msg(). This separation is necessary because
we sometimes want to forward messages even when there is no error
(i.e., protocol messages and successfully secondary looked up data
messages).
