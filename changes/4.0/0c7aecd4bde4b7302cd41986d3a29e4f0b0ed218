netns: add rtnl cmd to add and get peer netns ids

With this patch, a user can define an id for a peer netns by providing a FD or a
PID. These ids are local to the netns where it is added (ie valid only into this
netns).

The main function (ie the one exported to other module), peernet2id(), allows to
get the id of a peer netns. If no id has been assigned by the user, this
function allocates one.

These ids will be used in netlink messages to point to a peer netns, for example
in case of a x-netns interface.
