[media] cx231xx: fix usbdev leak on failure paths in cx231xx_usb_probe()

Commit b7085c086475 ("cx231xx: convert from pr_foo to dev_foo")
moves usb_get_dev(interface_to_usbdev(interface)) to the beginning
of cx231xx_usb_probe() to use udev->dev in dev_err(),
but it does not make sure usbdev is put on all failure paths.

Later dev_err(udev->dev) was replaced by dev_err(d).
So the patch moves usb_get_dev() below (before the first use)
and fixes another failure path.
