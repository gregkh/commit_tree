virtio_balloon: set DRIVER_OK before using device

virtio spec requires that all drivers set DRIVER_OK
before using devices. While balloon isn't yet
included in the virtio 1 spec, previous spec versions
also required this.

virtio balloon might violate this rule: probe calls
kthread_run before setting DRIVER_OK, which might run
immediately and cause balloon to inflate/deflate.

To fix, call virtio_device_ready before running the kthread.
