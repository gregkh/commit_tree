USB: ftdi_sio: add PIDs for Actisense USB devices

These product identifiers (PID) all deal with marine NMEA format data
used on motor boats and yachts. We supply the programmed devices to
Chetco, for use inside their equipment. The PIDs are a direct copy of
our Windows device drivers (FTDI drivers with altered PIDs).
