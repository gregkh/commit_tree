Bluetooth: Add helpers for src/dst bdaddr type conversion

The current bdaddr_type() usage in l2cap_core.c is a bit funny in that
it's always passed a hci_conn + a hci_conn member. Because of this only
the hci_conn is really needed. Since the second parameter is always
either hcon->src_type or hcon->dst type this patch adds two helper
functions for each purpose: bdaddr_src_type() and bdaddr_dst_type().
