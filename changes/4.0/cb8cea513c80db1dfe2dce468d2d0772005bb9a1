dmaengine: Create a generic dma_slave_caps callback

dma_slave_caps is very important to the generic layers that might interact with
dmaengine, such as ASoC. Unfortunately, it has been added as yet another
dma_device callback, and most of the existing drivers haven't implemented it,
reducing its reliability.

Introduce a generic behaviour to implement this, that rely on both the split of
device_control to derive which functions are supported and on new variables to
be set in the dma_device structure.

These variables holds what used to be the capabilities, that were set
per-channel. However, this proved to be a bit overkill, since every driver
filling these so far were hardcoding it, disregarding which channel was
actually given.
