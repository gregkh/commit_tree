PM / OPP: Assert RCU lock in exported functions

Add lockdep asserts for holding the RCU lock when calling
dev_pm_opp_get_freq() and dev_pm_opp_get_voltage() to aid in detecting
RCU misuses.

These are called often after dev_pm_opp_find_freq_ceil/exact() which
already asserts for RCU lock. However one could make an error by
releasing lock too early - just after dev_pm_opp_find_freq_ceil().
