drm/i915: Remove obsolete seqno parameter from 'i915_add_request'

There is no longer any need to retrieve a seqno value from an i915_add_request()
call. The calling code already knows which request structure is being processed
(it can only be ring->OLR). And as the request itself is now used in preference
to the basic seqno value, the latter is now redundant in this situation.
