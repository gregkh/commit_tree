ACPI / EC: Reduce ec_poll() by referencing the last register access timestamp.

Timeout in the ec_poll() doesn't refer to the last register access time. It
thus can win the competition against the acpi_ec_gpe_handler() if a
transaction takes longer than 1ms but individual register accesses are less
than 1ms.  In some cases, it can make the following silicon bug easier to
be triggered:
 GPE EN is not wired to the GPE trigger line, so when GPE STS is already
 set when 1 is written to GPE EN, no GPE can be triggered.

This patch adds register access timestamp reference support for ec_poll()
to reduce the number of ec_poll() invocations.
