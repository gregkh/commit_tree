KVM: x86: Access to LDT/GDT that wraparound is incorrect

When access to descriptor in LDT/GDT wraparound outside long-mode, the address
of the descriptor should be truncated to 32-bit.  Citing Intel SDM 2.1.1.1
"Global and Local Descriptor Tables in IA-32e Mode": "GDTR and LDTR registers
are expanded to 64-bits wide in both IA-32e sub-modes (64-bit mode and
compatibility mode)."

So in other cases, we need to truncate. Creating new function to return a
pointer to descriptor table to avoid too much code duplication.
