Bluetooth: Fix OOB data present value for BR/EDR Secure Connections

When BR/EDR Secure Connections has been enabled, the OOB data present
value can take 2 additional values. The host has to clearly provide
details about if P-192 OOB data, P-256 OOB data or a combination of
P-192 and P-256 OOB data is present.

In case BR/EDR Secure Connections is not enabled or not supported,
then check that P-192 OOB data is actually present and return the
correct value based on that.
