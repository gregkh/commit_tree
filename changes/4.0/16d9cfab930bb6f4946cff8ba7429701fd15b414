raid5: check faulty flag for array status during recovery.

When we have more than 1 drive failure, it's possible we start
rebuild one drive while leaving another faulty drive in array.
To determine whether array will be optimal after building, current
code only check whether a drive is missing, which could potentially
lead to data corruption. This patch is to add checking Faulty flag.
