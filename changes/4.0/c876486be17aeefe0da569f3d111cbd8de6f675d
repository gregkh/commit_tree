nfsd: fix clp->cl_revoked list deletion causing softlock in nfsd

commit 2d4a532d385f ("nfsd: ensure that clp->cl_revoked list is
protected by clp->cl_lock") removed the use of the reaplist to
clean out clp->cl_revoked. It failed to change list_entry() to
walk clp->cl_revoked.next instead of reaplist.next
