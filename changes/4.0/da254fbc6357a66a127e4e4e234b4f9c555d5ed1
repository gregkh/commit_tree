bnx2x: Fix kdump when iommu=on

When IOMM-vtd is active, once main kernel crashes unfinished DMAE transactions
will be blocked, putting the HW in an error state which will cause further
transactions to timeout.

Current employed logic uses wrong macros, causing the first function to be the
only function that cleanups that error state during its probe/load.

This patch allows all the functions to successfully re-load in kdump kernel.
