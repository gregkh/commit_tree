i40evf: Remove some scary log messages

These messages may be triggered during normal init of the driver if the
PF or FW take a long time to respond. There's nothing really wrong, so
don't freak people out logging messages.

If the communication channel really is dead, then we'll retry a few
times and give up. This will log a different more scary message that
should cause consternation. This allows the user to more easily detect a
genuine failure.
