f2fs: merge flags in struct f2fs_sb_info

Currently, there are several variables with Boolean type as below:

struct f2fs_sb_info {
...
	int s_dirty;
	bool need_fsck;
	bool s_closing;
...
	bool por_doing;
...
}

For this there are some issues:
1. there are some space of f2fs_sb_info is wasted due to aligning after Boolean
   type variables by compiler.
2. if we continuously add new flag into f2fs_sb_info, structure will be messed
   up.

So in this patch, we try to:
1. switch s_dirty to Boolean type variable since it has two status 0/1.
2. merge s_dirty/need_fsck/s_closing/por_doing variables into s_flag.
3. introduce an enum type which can indicate different states of sbi.
4. use new introduced universal interfaces is_sbi_flag_set/{set,clear}_sbi_flag
   to operate flags for sbi.

After that, above issues will be fixed.
