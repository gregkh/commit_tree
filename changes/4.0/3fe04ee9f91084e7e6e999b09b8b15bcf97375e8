svcrdma: Scrub BUG_ON() and WARN_ON() call sites

Current convention is to avoid using BUG_ON() in places where an
oops could cause complete system failure.

Replace BUG_ON() call sites in svcrdma with an assertion error
message and allow execution to continue safely.

Some BUG_ON() calls are removed because they have never fired in
production (that we are aware of).

Some WARN_ON() calls are also replaced where a back trace is not
helpful; e.g., in a workqueue task.
