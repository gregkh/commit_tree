[media] adv7180: Do not request the IRQ again during resume

Currently the IRQ is requested from within the init_device() function. This
function is not only called during device probe, but also during resume
causing the driver to try to request the IRQ again. Move requesting the IRQ
from init_device() to the probe function to make sure that it is only
requested once.
