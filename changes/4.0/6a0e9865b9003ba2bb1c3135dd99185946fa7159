MIPS: asm: stackframe: Do not preserve the HI/LO registers on MIPS R6

The HI/LO registers have been removed from MIPS R6. Instructions
such as MULT and DIV have been replaced with a new pair of
instructions for the HI/LO operations for example:

MULT -> MUL, MUH
DIV -> DIV, MOD

So we avoid preserving the pre-R6 HI/LO registers in MIPS R6
