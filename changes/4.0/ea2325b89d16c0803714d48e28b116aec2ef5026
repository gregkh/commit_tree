mwifiex: set netif carrier off in ndo_open

This patch adds fix to set carrier state off during ndo_open.
Carrier should be set to ON when device is ready to send data.
In case of station/adhoc interface device is able to transfer
data after successful association/join operation.
For AP this would be after bss_active event.
