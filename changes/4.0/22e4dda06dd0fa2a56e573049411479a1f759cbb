crypto: qat - fix device reset flow

When the device needs a reset, e.g. when an uncorrectable PCIe AER event
occurs, various services/data structures need to be cleaned up, the
hardware reset and the services/data structures initialized and started.
The code to perform the cleanup and initialization was not performed when
a device reset was done.

This patch moves some of the initialization code out of the .probe entry-
point into a separate function that is now called during probe as well as
after the hardware has been reset.  Similarly, a new function is added for
first cleaning up these services/data structures prior to resetting.  The
new functions are adf_dev_init() and adf_dev_shutdown(), respectively, for
which there are already prototypes but no actual functions just yet and are
now called when the device is reset and during probe/cleanup of the driver.
The down and up flows via ioctl calls has similarly been updated.

In addition, there are two other bugs in the reset flow - one in the logic
for determining whether to schedule a device reset upon receiving an
uncorrectable AER event which prevents the reset flow from being initiated,
and another with clearing the status bit indicating a device is configured
(when resetting the device the configuration remains across the reset so
the bit should not be cleared, otherwise, the necessary services will not
be re-started in adf_dev_start() after the reset - clear the bit only when
actually deleting the configuration).
