gianfar: Reduce logging noise seen due to phy polling if link is down

Commit 6ce29b0e2a04 ("gianfar: Avoid unnecessary reg accesses in adjust_link()")
eliminates unnecessary calls to adjust_link for phy devices which don't support
interrupts and need polling. As part of that work, the 'new_state' local flag,
which was used to reduce logging noise on the console, was eliminated.

Unfortunately, that means that a 'Link is Down' log message will now be
issued continuously if a link is configured as UP, the link state is down,
and the associated phy requires polling. This occurs because priv->oldduplex
is -1 in this case, which always differs from phydev->duplex. In addition,
phydev->speed may also differ from priv->oldspeed.  gfar_update_link_state()
is therefore called each time a phy is polled, even if the link state did not
change.
