spi: Check to see if the device is processing a message before we idle

cur_msg is updated under the queue lock and holds the message we are
currently processing. Since currently we only ever do removals in the
pump kthread it doesn't matter in what order we do things but we want
to be able to push things out from the submitting thread so pull the
check to see if we're currently handling a message before we check to
see if the queue is idle.
