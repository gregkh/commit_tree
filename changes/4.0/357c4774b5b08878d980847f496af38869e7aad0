tipc: correctly handle releasing a not fully initialized sock

Commit f2f9800d4955 "tipc: make tipc node table aware of net
namespace" has added a dereference of sock->sk before making sure it's
not NULL, which makes releasing a tipc socket NULL pointer dereference
for sockets that are not fully initialized.
