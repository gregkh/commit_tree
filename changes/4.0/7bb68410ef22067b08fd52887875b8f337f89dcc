efi: split off remapping code from efi_config_init()

Split of the remapping code from efi_config_init() so that the caller
can perform its own remapping. This is necessary to correctly handle
virtually remapped UEFI memory regions under kexec, as efi.systab will
have been updated to a virtual address.
