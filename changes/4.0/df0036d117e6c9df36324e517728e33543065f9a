kdb: Fix off by one error in kdb_cpu()

There was a follow on replacement patch against the prior
"kgdb: Timeout if secondary CPUs ignore the roundup".

See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/7/442

This patch is the delta vs the patch that was committed upstream:
  * Fix an off-by-one error in kdb_cpu().
  * Replace NR_CPUS with CONFIG_NR_CPUS to tell checkpatch that we
    really want a static limit.
  * Removed the "KGDB: " prefix from the pr_crit() in debug_core.c
    (kgdb-next contains a patch which introduced pr_fmt() to this file
    to the tag will now be applied automatically).
