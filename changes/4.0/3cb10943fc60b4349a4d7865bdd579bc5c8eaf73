ath10k: use IEEE80211_HW_SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL

The ath10k driver only supports HW crypto (except for management
frames or so - CMAC needs to be done in software). Make it use
the new IEEE80211_HW_SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL flag to ensure mac80211
doesn't erroneously attempt to use software crypto.

Taking through my tree after Kalle's ACK to avoid breaking the
ath10k driver with the next crypto patches.
