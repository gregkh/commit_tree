serial: core: Simplify console suspend logic in uart_suspend_port()

When the uart port being suspended is a console and consoles are
not suspending (kernel command line contains no_console_suspend),
then no action is performed for that port, and the function can
return early.

If the function has not returned early, then one of the conditions
is not true, so the expression
   (console_suspend_enabled || !uart_console(uport))
must be true and can be eliminated.

Similarly, the expression
   (console_suspend_enabled && uart_console(uport))
simplifies to just uart_console(uport).
