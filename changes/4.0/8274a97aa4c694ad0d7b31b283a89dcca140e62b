fib_trie: Update usage stats to be percpu instead of global variables

The trie usage stats were currently being shared by all threads that were
calling fib_table_lookup.  As a result when multiple threads were
performing lookups simultaneously the trie would begin to cache bounce
between those threads.

In order to prevent this I have updated the usage stats to use a set of
percpu variables.  By doing this we should be able to avoid the cache
bouncing and still make use of these stats.
