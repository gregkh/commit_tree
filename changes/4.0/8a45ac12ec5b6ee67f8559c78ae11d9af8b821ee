crypto: testmgr - don't use interruptible wait in tests

tcrypt/testmgr uses wait_for_completion_interruptible() everywhere when
it waits for a request to be completed.  If it's interrupted, then the
test is aborted and the request is freed.

However, if any of these calls actually do get interrupted, the result
will likely be a kernel crash, when the driver handles the now-freed
request.  Use wait_for_completion() instead.
