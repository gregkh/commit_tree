i8k: Rework error retries

Instead of returning a previous value if the SMM code returns
an error when trying to read a temperature, retry once.
If that fails again, return -ENODATA. Also return -ENODATA if an
attempt is made to read the GPU temperature but the GPU is
currently turned off.

Drop the I8K_TEMPERATURE_BUG definition and handle the related bug
unconditionally.
