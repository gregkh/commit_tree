kexec: Fix make headers_check

Remove the unneded declaration for a kexec_load() routine.

Fixes errors like these when running 'make headers_check':

include/uapi/linux/kexec.h: userspace cannot reference function or variable defined in the kernel

: The kexec_load declaration isn't very useful for userspace, see the patch
: I submitted in http://lkml.kernel.org/r/1389791824.17407.9.camel@x220 .
: And After my attempt the export of that declaration has also been

: In that last discussion no one has been able to point to an actual user of
: it.  So, as far as I can tell, no one actually uses it.  Which makes
: sense, because including this header by itself doesn't give one access to
: a useful definition of kexec_load.  So why bother with the declaration?
