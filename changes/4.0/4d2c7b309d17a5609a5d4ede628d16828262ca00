staging/lustre/ldlm: high load because of negative timeout

When the time of LRU resizing exceeds waiting period of
recalculation, the ldlm daemon will keep on resizing without any
interval of rest. That will cause high CPU load.

This patch fixes the problem by setting the recalculation timestamp
after LRU resizing finishes rather than before it. What is more, an
interval of one second is enforced between each recalculation.
