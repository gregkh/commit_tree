crypto: af_alg - add setsockopt for auth tag size

Use setsockopt on the tfm FD to provide the authentication tag size for
an AEAD cipher. This is achieved by adding a callback function which is
intended to be used by the AEAD AF_ALG implementation.

The optlen argument of the setsockopt specifies the authentication tag
size to be used with the AEAD tfm.
