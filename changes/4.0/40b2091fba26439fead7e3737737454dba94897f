ARM: omap2plus_defconfig: reduce zImage size on omap2plus_defconfig

By converting a few drivers to modules because they
won't be needed during boot anyways, we can shave off
about 700KiB of text.

Note that while at that, and after discussions with Tony
Lindgren, a few extra drivers were either removed because
they weren't needed, or added because they're useful for
debugging/testing.

Below is output of size for pre and post vmlinux binaries:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
