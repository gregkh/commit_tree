power: bq24190: Fix ignored supplicants

The driver mismatched 'num_supplicants' with 'num_supplies' of
power_supply structure.

It provided list of supplicants (power_supply.supplied_to) but did
not set the number of supplicants. Instead it set the num_supplies which
is used when iterating over number of supplies (power_supply.supplied_from).

As a result the list of supplicants was ignored by core because its size
was 0.
