Revert "wireless: Support of IFLA_INFO_KIND rtnl attribute"

This reverts commit ba1debdfed974f25aa598c283567878657b292ee.

Oliver reported that it breaks network-manager, for some reason with
this patch NM decides that the device isn't wireless but "generic"
(ethernet), sees no carrier (as expected with wifi) and fails to do
anything else with it.

Revert this to unbreak userspace.
