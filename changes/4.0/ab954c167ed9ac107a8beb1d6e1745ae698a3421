rcu: Remove redundant callback-list initialization

The RCU callback lists are initialized in both rcu_boot_init_percpu_data()
and rcu_init_percpu_data().  The former is intended for initializing
immutable data, so this commit removes the initialization from
rcu_boot_init_percpu_data() and leaves it in rcu_init_percpu_data().
This change prepares for permitting callbacks to be queued very early
in boot.
