syscalls: Declare sys_*stat64 prototypes if __ARCH_WANT_(COMPAT_)STAT64

Currently, the sys_stat64, sys_fstat64 and sys_lstat64 prototpyes are
only declared if BITS_PER_LONG == 32. Following commit 0753f70f07fb
(fs: Build sys_stat64() and friends if __ARCH_WANT_COMPAT_STAT64), the
implementation of these functions is allowed on 64-bit systems for
compat support. The patch changes the condition on the prototype
declaration from BITS_PER_LONG == 32 to defined(__ARCH_WANT_STAT64) ||
defined(__ARCH_WANT_COMPAT_STAT64).

In addition, it moves the sys_fstatat64 prototype under the same #if
block
