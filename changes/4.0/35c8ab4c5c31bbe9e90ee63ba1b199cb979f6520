arm64: Relax licensing of arm64 Xen DMA operations

With Xen configured into the arm64 kernel, any driver allocating
DMA'able memory for PCI operations, must be GPL compatible, regardless
of its interaction with Xen. This patch relaxes the GPL requirement of
xen_dma_ops and its dependencies to allow open source drivers to be
compiled for the arm64 architecture.
