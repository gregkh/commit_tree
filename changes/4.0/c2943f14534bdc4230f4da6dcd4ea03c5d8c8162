net: ipv6: Add sysctl entry to disable MTU updates from RA

The kernel forcefully applies MTU values received in router
advertisements provided the new MTU is less than the current. This
behavior is undesirable when the user space is managing the MTU. Instead
a sysctl flag 'accept_ra_mtu' is introduced such that the user space
can control whether or not RA provided MTU updates should be applied. The
default behavior is unchanged; user space must explicitly set this flag
to 0 for RA MTUs to be ignored.
