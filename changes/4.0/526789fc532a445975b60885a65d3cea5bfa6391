mtd: nand: ams-delta: fix overwritten mtd_info->owner in initialization

In initialization routine, mtd_info->owner is overwritten by memset()
just after being initialized.  This can be fixed by moving memset() calls
to just before setting mtd_info->owner.  But the memory region is allocated
by kmalloc, so we can fix it by using kzalloc instead of kmalloc.
