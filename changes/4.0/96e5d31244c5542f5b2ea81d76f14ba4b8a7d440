usb: dwc3: dwc3-omap: Fix disable IRQ

In the wrapper the IRQ disable should be done by writing 1's to the
IRQ*_CLR register. Existing code is broken because it instead writes
zeros to IRQ*_SET register.

Fix this by adding functions dwc3_omap_write_irqmisc_clr() and
dwc3_omap_write_irq0_clr() which do the right thing.
