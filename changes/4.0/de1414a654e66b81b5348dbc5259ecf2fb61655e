fs: export inode_to_bdi and use it in favor of mapping->backing_dev_info

Now that we got rid of the bdi abuse on character devices we can always use
sb->s_bdi to get at the backing_dev_info for a file, except for the block
device special case.  Export inode_to_bdi and replace uses of
mapping->backing_dev_info with it to prepare for the removal of
mapping->backing_dev_info.
