Revert "drm/i915/chv: Use timeout mode for RC6 on chv"

This reverts commit 5a0afd4b78ec23f27f5d486ac3d102c2e8d66bd7.

Although timeout mode allows higher residency it impact badly on performance.
I believe while we don't have a way to balance between performance and
power savings at runtime I believe we have to revert and prioritize
performance that was impacted a lot.
