usb: use %*pb[l] to print bitmaps including cpumasks and nodemasks

printk and friends can now format bitmaps using '%*pb[l]'.  cpumask
and nodemask also provide cpumask_pr_args() and nodemask_pr_args()
respectively which can be used to generate the two printf arguments
necessary to format the specified cpu/nodemask.

* drivers/uwb/drp.c::uwb_drp_handle_alien_drp() was formatting mas.bm
  into a buffer but never used it.  Removed.
