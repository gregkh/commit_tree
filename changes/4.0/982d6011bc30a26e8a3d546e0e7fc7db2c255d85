ceph: improve reference tracking for snaprealm

When snaprealm is created, its initial reference count is zero.
But in some rare cases, the newly created snaprealm is not referenced
by anyone. This causes snaprealm with zero reference count not freed.

The fix is set reference count of newly snaprealm to 1. The reference
is return the function who requests to create the snaprealm. When the
function finishes its job, it releases the reference.
