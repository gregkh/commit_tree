iio: adc: vf610: use ADC clock within specification

Depending on conversion mode used, the ADC clock (ADCK) needs
to be below a maximum frequency. According to Vybrid's data
sheet this is 20MHz for the low power conversion mode.

The ADC clock is depending on input clock, which is the bus
clock by default. Vybrid SoC are typically clocked at at 400MHz
or 500MHz, which leads to 66MHz or 83MHz bus clock respectively.
Hence, a divider of 8 is required to stay below the specified
maximum clock of 20MHz.

Due to the different bus clock speeds, the resulting sampling
frequency is not static. Hence use the ADC clock and calculate
the actual available sampling frequency dynamically.

This fixes bogous values observed on some 500MHz clocked Vybrid
SoC. The resulting value usually showed Bit 9 being stuck at 1,
or 0, which lead to a value of +/-512.
