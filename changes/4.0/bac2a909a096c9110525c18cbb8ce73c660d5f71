PCI / PM: Avoid resuming PCI devices during system suspend

Commit f25c0ae2b4c4 (ACPI / PM: Avoid resuming devices in ACPI PM
domain during system suspend) modified the ACPI PM domain's system
suspend callbacks to allow devices attached to it to be left in the
runtime-suspended state during system suspend so as to optimize
the suspend process.

This was based on the general mechanism introduced by commit
aae4518b3124 (PM / sleep: Mechanism to avoid resuming runtime-suspended
devices unnecessarily).

Extend that approach to PCI devices by modifying the PCI bus type's
->prepare callback to return 1 for devices that are runtime-suspended
when it is being executed and that are in a suitable power state and
need not be resumed going forward.
