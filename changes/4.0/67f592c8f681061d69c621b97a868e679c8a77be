ACPI / cpuidle: Drop unnecessary calls from ->enter callback routines

acpi_idle_enter_simple() and acpi_idle_enter_bm() don't need to
call sched_clock_idle_sleep/wakeup_event(), because that's taken
care of by the core already.  Namely, sched_clock_idle_sleep_event()
is called by tick_nohz_start_idle() called by __tick_nohz_idle_enter()
which in turn is called by tick_nohz_idle_enter() and that is called
by cpu_idle_loop().  Analogously for sched_clock_idle_wakeup_event().

For this reason, drop those calls from the ACPI cpuidle driver's
->enter callback routines.
