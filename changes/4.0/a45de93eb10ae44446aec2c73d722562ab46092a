ACPICA: Resources: Provide common part for struct acpi_resource_address structures.

struct acpi_resource_address and struct acpi_resource_extended_address64 share substracts
just at different offsets. To unify the parsing functions, OSPMs like Linux
need a new ACPI_ADDRESS64_ATTRIBUTE as their substructs, so they can
extract the shared data.

This patch also synchronizes the structure changes to the Linux kernel.
The usages are searched by matching the following keywords:
1. acpi_resource_address
2. acpi_resource_extended_address
3. ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_ADDRESS
4. ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_EXTENDED_ADDRESS
And we found and fixed the usages in the following files:
 arch/ia64/kernel/acpi-ext.c
 arch/ia64/pci/pci.c
 arch/x86/pci/acpi.c
 arch/x86/pci/mmconfig-shared.c
 drivers/xen/xen-acpi-memhotplug.c
 drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c
 drivers/acpi/pci_root.c
 drivers/acpi/resource.c
 drivers/char/hpet.c
 drivers/pnp/pnpacpi/rsparser.c
 drivers/hv/vmbus_drv.c

Build tests are passed with defconfig/allnoconfig/allyesconfig and
defconfig+CONFIG_ACPI=n.
