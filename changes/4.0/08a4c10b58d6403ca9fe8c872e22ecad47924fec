ALSA: ice1712: Remove always NULL parameters

The various PCM allocation functions in this driver take a pointer to a
pointer of a PCM where if this parameter is provided the newly allocated PCM
is stored. All callers pass NULL though, so remove the parameter. This makes
the code a bit cleaner and shorter.
