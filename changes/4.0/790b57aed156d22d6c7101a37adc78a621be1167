irqchip: gicv3-its: Use 64KB page as default granule

The field of page size in register GITS_BASERn might be read-only
if an implementation only supports a single, fixed page size. But
currently the ITS driver will throw out an error when PAGE_SIZE
is less than the minimum size supported by an ITS. So addressing
this problem by using 64KB pages as default granule for all the
ITS base tables.
