drm/nouveau/clk: rename from clock (no binary change)

Rename to match the Linux subsystem responsible for the same kind of
things.  Will be investigating how feasible it will be to expose the
GPU clock trees with it at some point.

The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).

Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
naming to ease collaboration with them.

A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.
