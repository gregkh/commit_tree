[media] solo6x10: just pass frame motion flag from hardware, drop additional handling as complicated and unstable

Dropping code (introduced in 316d9e84a72069e04e483de0d5934c1d75f6a44c)
which intends to make raising of motion events more "smooth"(?).

It made motion event never appear in my installation.
That code is complicated, so I couldn't figure out quickly how to fix
it, so dropping it seems better to me.

Another justification is that anyway application would implement
"motion signal stabilization" if required, it is not necessarily kernel
driver's job.
