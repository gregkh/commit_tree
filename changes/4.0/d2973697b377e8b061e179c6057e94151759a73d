mm: memcontrol: use "max" instead of "infinity" in control knobs

The memcg control knobs indicate the highest possible value using the
symbolic name "infinity", which is long and awkward to type.

Switch to the string "max", which is just as descriptive but shorter and
sweeter.

This changes a user interface, so do it before the release and before
the development flag is dropped from the default hierarchy.
