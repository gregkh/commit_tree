ALSA: seq: increase the maximum number of queues

Queues are used both for scheduling playback events and for assigning
timestamps to recorded events, so it is easy to need quite a lot of
them, especially on a multi-user system.  Additionally, the actual
queue objects are allocated dynamically, so it does not really make
sense to have a low limit.  Increase it to something still sane.
