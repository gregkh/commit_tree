[media] rc: sunxi-cir: Add support for the larger fifo found on sun5i and sun6i

Add support for the larger fifo found on sun5i and sun6i, having a separate
compatible for the ir found on sun5i & sun6i also is useful if we ever want
to add ir transmit support, because the sun5i & sun6i version do not have
transmit support.

Note this commits also adds checking for the end-of-packet interrupt flag
(which was already enabled), as the fifo-data-available interrupt flag only
gets set when the trigger-level is exceeded. So far we've been getting away
with not doing this because of the low trigger-level, but this is something
which we should have done since day one.
