HID: i2c-hid: The interrupt should be level sensitive

The Microsoft HID over I2C specification says two things regarding the
interrupt:

 1) The interrupt should be level sensitive
 2) The device keeps the interrupt asserted as long as it has more reports
    available.

We've seen that at least some Atmel and N-Trig panels keep the line low as
long as they have something to send. The current version of the driver only
detects the first edge but then fails to read rest of the reports (as the
line is still asserted).

Make the driver follow the specification and configure the HID interrupt to
be level sensitive.

The Windows HID over I2C driver also seems to do the same.
