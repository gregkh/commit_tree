rxrpc: bogus MSG_PEEK test in rxrpc_recvmsg()

[I would really like an ACK on that one from dhowells; it appears to be
quite straightforward, but...]

MSG_PEEK isn't passed to ->recvmsg() via msg->msg_flags; as the matter of
fact, neither the kernel users of rxrpc, nor the syscalls ever set that bit
in there.  It gets passed via flags; in fact, another such check in the same
function is done correctly - as flags & MSG_PEEK.

It had been that way (effectively disabled) for 8 years, though, so the patch
needs beating up - that case had never been tested.  If it is correct, it's
-stable fodder.
