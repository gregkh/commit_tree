dm raid: fix a couple integer overflows

My static checker complains that if "num_raid_params" is UINT_MAX then
the "if (num_raid_params + 1 > argc) {" check doesn't work as intended.

The other change is that I moved the "if (argc != (num_raid_devs * 2))"
condition forward a few lines so it was before the call to
context_alloc().  If we had an integer overflow inside that function
then it would lead to an immediate crash.
