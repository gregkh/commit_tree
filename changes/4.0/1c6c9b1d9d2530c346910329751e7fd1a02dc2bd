pcmcia: handle anonymous cards by generating a fake CIS

The core pcmcia code blows up all over the place if it allowed a card without
a valid CIS. We need to allow such cards as the CIS stuff is not on the older
flash, ROM and SRAM cards.

In order to minimise the risk of misidentifying junk and feeding it to the
wrong thing we only fix up apparently anonymous cards if the driver for them
has been enabled.
