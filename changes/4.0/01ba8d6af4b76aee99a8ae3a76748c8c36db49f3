tty: serial: men_z135_uart: Fix driver for changes in hardware

16z135 IP Core has changed so the driver needs to be updated to respect
these changes. The following changes have been made:

* Don't invert the 16z135 modem status register when reading.
* Add module parameter to configure the (baud rate dependent) RX timeout.
  Character timeout in seconds = (timeout_reg * baud_reg * 4)/freq_reg.
* Enable the handling of UART core's automatic flow control feature.
  When AFE is active disable generation of modem status IRQs.
* Rework the handling of IRQs to be conform with newer FPGA versions and
  take precautions not to miss an interrupt because of the destructive read
  of the IIR register.
* Correct men_z135_handle_modem_status(), MSR is stat_reg[15:8] not
  stat_reg[7:0]
* Correct calling of uart_handle_{dcd,cts}_change()
* Reset CLOCAL when CRTSCTS is set
