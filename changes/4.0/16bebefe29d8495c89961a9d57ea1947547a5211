KVM: x86: fnstcw and fnstsw may cause spurious exception

Since the operand size of fnstcw and fnstsw is updated during the execution,
the emulation may cause spurious exceptions as it reads the memory beforehand.

Marking these instructions as Mov (since the previous value is ignored) and
DstMem16 to simplify the setting of operand size.
