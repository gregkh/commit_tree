mmc: pwrseq_simple: Extend to support more pins

Many WLAN attached to a SDIO/MMC interface, needs more than one pin for
their reset sequence. For example, is very common for chips to have two
pins: one for reset and one for power enable.

This patch adds support for more reset pins to the pwrseq_simple driver
and instead hardcoding a fixed number, it uses the of_gpio_named_count()
since the MMC power sequence is only built when CONFIG_OF is enabled.
