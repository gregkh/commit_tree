perf/x86/intel: Fix Haswell CYCLE_ACTIVITY.* counter constraints

Some of the CYCLE_ACTIVITY.* events can only be scheduled on
counter 2.  Due to a typo Haswell matched those with
INTEL_EVENT_CONSTRAINT, which lead to the events never
matching as the comparison does not expect anything
in the umask too. Fix the typo.
