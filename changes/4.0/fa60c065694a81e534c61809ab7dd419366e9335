ALSA: wss: Remove (almost) always NULL parameters

Most callers of snd_wss_pcm(), snd_wss_timer() and snd_cs4236_pcm() pass
NULL as the last parameter, some callers pass a pointer but never use it
after the function has been called and only a few callers pass a pointer and
actually use it. The later is only the case for snd_wss_pcm() for
snd_cs4236_pcm() and it is possible to get the same PCM object by accessing
the pcm field of the snd_wss struct that was passed as the first parameter.

This function removes the last parameters from the functions mentioned above
and updates the callers which used it to use chip->pcm instead. This allows
us to slightly simplify the functions since they don't have to check and set
the last parameter anymore which makes the code slightly shorter and
cleaner.
