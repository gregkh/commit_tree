irda: stir4200: Replace timeval with ktime_t

The stir4200 driver uses 'timeval', which we try to remove in the kernel
because all 32-bit time types will break in the year 2038.

This patch also changes do_gettimeofday() to ktime_get() accordingly,
since ktime_get returns a ktime_t, but do_gettimeofday returns a
struct timeval, and the other reason is that ktime_get() uses
the monotonic clock.

This patch uses ktime_us_delta to get the elapsed time of microsecond.
