iio: core: Introduce STEPS channel, ENABLE mask and INSTANCE event

These changes are needed to support the functionality of a pedometer.
A pedometer has two basic functionalities: step counter and step detector.

The step counter needs to be enabled and then it will count the steps
in its hardware register. Whenever the application needs to check
the step count, it will read the step counter register. To support the
step counter a new channel type STEPS is added. Since the pedometer needs
to be enabled first so that the hardware can count and store the steps,
we need a specific ENABLE channel info mask.

The step detector will generate an interrupt each time a step is detected.
To support this functionality we add a new event type INSTANCE.

For more information on the Android requirements for step counter and step
detector see:

and http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/composite_sensors.html#detector.

A device that has the pedometer functionality this interface needs to
support is Freescale's MMA9553L:
