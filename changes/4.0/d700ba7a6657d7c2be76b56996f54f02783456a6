drm/tegra: dc: Describe register copies

Most of the display controller's registers are double-buffered, a few of
them are triple-buffered. The ASSEMBLY shadow copy is latched intto the
ACTIVE copy for double-buffered registers. For triple-buffered registers
the ASSEMBLY copy is first latched into the ARM copy.

Latching into the ACTIVE copy happens immediately if the controller is
inactive. Otherwise the latching happens on the next frame boundary. The
latching of the ASSEMBLY into the ARM copy happens immediately. Latching
is controlled by a set of *_ACT_REQ and *_UPDATE bits in the
DC_CMD_STATE_CONTROL register.
