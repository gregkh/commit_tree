fs: consolidate {nr,free}_cached_objects args in shrink_control

We are going to make FS shrinkers memcg-aware.  To achieve that, we will
have to pass the memcg to scan to the nr_cached_objects and
free_cached_objects VFS methods, which currently take only the NUMA node
to scan.  Since the shrink_control structure already holds the node, and
the memcg to scan will be added to it when we introduce memcg-aware
vmscan, let us consolidate the methods' arguments in this structure to
keep things clean.
