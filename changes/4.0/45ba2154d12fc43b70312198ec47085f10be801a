xhci: fix reporting of 0-sized URBs in control endpoint

When a control transfer has a short data stage, the xHCI controller generates
two transfer events: a COMP_SHORT_TX event that specifies the untransferred
amount, and a COMP_SUCCESS event. But when the data stage is not short, only the
COMP_SUCCESS event occurs. Therefore, xhci-hcd must set urb->actual_length to
urb->transfer_buffer_length while processing the COMP_SUCCESS event, unless
urb->actual_length was set already by a previous COMP_SHORT_TX event.

The driver checks this by seeing whether urb->actual_length == 0, but this alone
is the wrong test, as it is entirely possible for a short transfer to have an
urb->actual_length = 0.

This patch changes the xhci driver to rely on a new td->urb_length_set flag,
which is set to true when a COMP_SHORT_TX event is received and the URB length
updated at that stage.

This fixes a bug which affected the HSO plugin, which relies on URBs with
urb->actual_length == 0 to halt re-submitting the RX URB in the control
endpoint.
