drm: Include drm_crtc_helper.h in DocBook

There is already a section that describes the helpers implemented by
this module. Add the kerneldoc-generated structure descriptions to this
section.

While at it, add missing kerneldoc for the structures to avoid warnings
when generating the documentation.
