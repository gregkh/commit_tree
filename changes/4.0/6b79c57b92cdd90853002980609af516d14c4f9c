mm: numa: disable change protection for vma(VM_HUGETLB)

Currently when a process accesses a hugetlb range protected with
PROTNONE, unexpected COWs are triggered, which finally puts the hugetlb
subsystem into a broken/uncontrollable state, where for example
h->resv_huge_pages is subtracted too much and wraps around to a very
large number, and the free hugepage pool is no longer maintainable.

This patch simply stops changing protection for vma(VM_HUGETLB) to fix
the problem.  And this also allows us to avoid useless overhead of minor
faults.
