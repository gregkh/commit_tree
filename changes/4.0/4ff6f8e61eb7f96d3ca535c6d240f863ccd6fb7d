KVM: emulate: fix CMPXCHG8B on 32-bit hosts

This has been broken for a long time: it broke first in 2.6.35, then was
almost fixed in 2.6.36 but this one-liner slipped through the cracks.
The bug shows up as an infinite loop in Windows 7 (and newer) boot on
32-bit hosts without EPT.

Windows uses CMPXCHG8B to write to page tables, which causes a
page fault if running without EPT; the emulator is then called from
kvm_mmu_page_fault.  The loop then happens if the higher 4 bytes are
not 0; the common case for this is that the NX bit (bit 63) is 1.
