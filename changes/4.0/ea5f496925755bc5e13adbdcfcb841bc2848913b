KVM: s390: only one external call may be pending at a time

Only one external call may be pending at a vcpu at a time. For this
reason, we have to detect whether the SIGP externcal call interpretation
facility is available. If so, all external calls have to be injected
using this mechanism.

SIGP EXTERNAL CALL orders have to return whether another external
call is already pending. This check was missing until now.

SIGP SENSE hasn't returned yet in all conditions whether an external
call was pending.

If a SIGP EXTERNAL CALL irq is to be injected and one is already
pending, -EBUSY is returned.
