watchdog: gpio_wdt: Add "always_running" feature to GPIO watchdog

On some chips, like the TPS386000, the trigger cannot be disabled
and the CPU must keep toggling the line at all times. Add a switch
"always_running" to keep toggling the GPIO line regardless of the
state of the soft part of the watchdog. The "armed" member keeps
track of whether a timeout must also cause a reset.
