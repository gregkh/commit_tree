arm/arm64: KVM: add tracing support for arm64 exit handler

arm64 uses its own copy of exit handler (arm64/kvm/handle_exit.c).
Currently this file doesn't hook up with any trace points. As a result
users might not see certain events (e.g. HVC & WFI) while using ftrace
with arm64 KVM. This patch fixes this issue by adding a new trace file
and defining two trace events (one of which is shared by wfi and wfe)
for arm64. The new trace points are then linked with related functions
in handle_exit.c.
