dm snapshot: fix a possible invalid memory access on unload

When the snapshot target is unloaded, snapshot_dtr() waits until
pending_exceptions_count drops to zero.  Then, it destroys the snapshot.
Therefore, the function that decrements pending_exceptions_count
should not touch the snapshot structure after the decrement.

pending_complete() calls free_pending_exception(), which decrements
pending_exceptions_count, and then it performs up_write(&s->lock) and it
calls retry_origin_bios() which dereferences  s->origin.  These two
memory accesses to the fields of the snapshot may touch the dm_snapshot
struture after it is freed.

This patch moves the call to free_pending_exception() to the end of
pending_complete(), so that the snapshot will not be destroyed while
pending_complete() is in progress.
