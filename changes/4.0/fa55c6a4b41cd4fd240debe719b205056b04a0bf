staging/lustre/ptlrpc: avoid list scan in ptlrpcd_check

ptlrpcd_check() always scan all requests on ptlrpc_request_set
and try to finish completed requests, this is low efficiency.
Even worse, l_wait_event() always checks condition for twice
before sleeping and one more time after waking up, which means
it will call ptlrpcd_check() for three times in each loop.

This patch will move completed requests at the head of list
in ptlrpc_check_set(), with this change ptlrpcd_check doesn't
need to scan all requests anymore.
