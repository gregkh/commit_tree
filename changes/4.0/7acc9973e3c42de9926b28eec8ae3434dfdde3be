usb: phy: generic: add vbus support

Add support for vbus detection and power supply. This code is more or
less stolen from phy-gpio-vbus-usb.c, and aims at providing a detection
mechanism for VBus (ie. usb cable plug) based on a GPIO line, and a
power supply activation which draws current from the VBus.
