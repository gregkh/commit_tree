watchdog: hpwdt: Fix initialization message in hpwdt.c

allow_kdump was enabled as default since following commit.

commit a089361cf5f1d6a5295aa5385238bd044998e1e9,
watchdog: hpwdt: Unregister NMI events on exit.

But the initialization message was not modified.
So it still shows

  HP Watchdog Timer Driver: NMI decoding initialized,
  allow kernel dump: ON (default = 0/OFF)    <=

This "default = 0/OFF" message may confuse users.
Fix it as "default = 1/ON".
