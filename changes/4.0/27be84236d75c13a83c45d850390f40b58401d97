iio: core: Introduce CHANGE event type

A step detector will generate an interrupt each time N step are detected.
A device that has such pedometer functionality is Freescale's MMA9553L:

Introduce IIO_EV_TYPE_CHANGE event type for events that are generated
when the channel passes a threshold on the absolute change in value.
