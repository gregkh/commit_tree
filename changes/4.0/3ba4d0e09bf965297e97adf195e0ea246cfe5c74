rcu: Note quiescent state when CPU goes offline

The rcu_cleanup_dead_cpu() function (called after a CPU has gone
completely offline) has not reported a quiescent state because there
was probably at least one synchronize_rcu() between the time the CPU
went offline and the CPU_DEAD notifier, and this would have detected
the CPU's offline state via quiescent-state forcing.  However, the plan
is for CPUs to take themselves offline, at which point it makes sense
for them to report their own quiescent state.  This commit makes this
change in preparation for the new CPU-hotplug setup.
