clk: divider: fix calculation of maximal parent rate for a given divider

The rate provided at the output of a clk-divider is calculated as:

	DIV_ROUND_UP(parent_rate, div)

since commit b11d282dbea2 (clk: divider: fix rate calculation for
fractional rates). So to yield a rate not bigger than r parent_rate
must be <= r * div.

The effect of choosing a parent rate that is too big as was done before
this patch results in wrongly ruling out good dividers.

Note that this is not a complete fix as __clk_round_rate might return a
value >= its 2nd parameter. Also for dividers with
CLK_DIVIDER_ROUND_CLOSEST set the calculation is not accurate. But this
fixes the test case by Sascha Hauer that uses a chain of three dividers
under a fixed clock.
