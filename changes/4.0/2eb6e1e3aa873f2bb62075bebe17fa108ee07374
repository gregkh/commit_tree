dm: submit stacked requests in irq enabled context

Switch to having request-based DM enqueue all prep'ed requests into work
processed by another thread.  This allows request-based DM to invoke
block APIs that assume interrupt enabled context (e.g. blk_get_request)
and is a prerequisite for adding blk-mq support to request-based DM.

The new kernel thread is only initialized for request-based DM devices.

multipath_map() is now always in irq enabled context so change multipath
spinlock (m->lock) locking to always disable interrupts.
