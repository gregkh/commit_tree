mm: drop support of non-linear mapping from unmap/zap codepath

We have remap_file_pages(2) emulation in -mm tree for few release cycles
and we plan to have it mainline in v3.20. This patchset removes rest of
VM_NONLINEAR infrastructure.

Patches 1-8 take care about generic code. They are pretty
straight-forward and can be applied without other of patches.

Rest patches removes pte_file()-related stuff from architecture-specific
code. It usually frees up one bit in non-present pte. I've tried to reuse
that bit for swap offset, where I was able to figure out how to do that.

For obvious reason I cannot test all that arch-specific code and would
like to see acks from maintainers.

In total, remap_file_pages(2) required about 1.4K lines of not-so-trivial
kernel code. That's too much for functionality nobody uses.

This patch (of 38):

We don't create non-linear mappings anymore. Let's drop code which
handles them on unmap/zap.
