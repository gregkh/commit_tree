Thermal/int340x/processor_thermal: Add thermal zone support

Added thermal zones for processor thermal using APIs provided by
int340x thermal zone module.
Like other INT340x devices, processor thermal device can also contain
trip points and way to get temperature. On some platform there is
no ACPI _TMP method, in those platform using IA64 architecture MSRs to
get temperature.
