usb: ftdi_sio: Add jtag quirk support for Cyber Cortex AV boards

This patch integrates Cyber Cortex AV boards with the existing
ftdi_jtag_quirk in order to use serial port 0 with JTAG which is
required by the manufacturers' software.

Steps: 2

[ftdi_sio_ids.h]
1. Defined the device PID

[ftdi_sio.c]
2. Added a macro declaration to the ids array, in order to enable the
jtag quirk for the device.
