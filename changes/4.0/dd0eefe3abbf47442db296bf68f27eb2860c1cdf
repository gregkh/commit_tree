net/mlx4_core: Set device configuration data to be persistent across reset

When an HCA enters an internal error state, this is detected by the driver.
The driver then should reset the HCA and restart the software stack.

Keep ports information and some SRIOV configuration in a persistent area
to have it valid across reset.
