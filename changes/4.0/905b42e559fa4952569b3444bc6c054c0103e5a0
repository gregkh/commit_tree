crypto: drbg - panic on continuous self test error

This patch adds a panic if the FIPS 140-2 self test error failed.
Note, that entire code is only executed with fips_enabled (i.e. when the
kernel is booted with fips=1. It is therefore not executed for 99.9% of
all user base.

As mathematically such failure cannot occur, this panic should never be
triggered. But to comply with NISTs current requirements, an endless
loop must be replaced with the panic.

When the new version of FIPS 140 will be released, this entire
continuous self test function will be ripped out as it will not be
needed any more.

This patch is functionally equivalent as implemented in ansi_cprng.c and drivers/char/random.c.
