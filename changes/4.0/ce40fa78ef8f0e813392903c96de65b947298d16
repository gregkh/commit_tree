Cachefiles: Fix up scripted S_ISDIR/S_ISREG/S_ISLNK conversions

Fix up the following scripted S_ISDIR/S_ISREG/S_ISLNK conversions (or lack
thereof) in cachefiles:

 (1) Cachefiles mostly wants to use d_can_lookup() rather than d_is_dir() as
     it doesn't want to deal with automounts in its cache.

 (2) Coccinelle didn't find S_IS* expressions in ASSERT() statements in
     cachefiles.
