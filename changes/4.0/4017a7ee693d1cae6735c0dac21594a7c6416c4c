netfilter: restore rule tracing via nfnetlink_log

Since fab4085 ("netfilter: log: nf_log_packet() as real unified
interface"), the loginfo structure that is passed to nf_log_packet() is
used to explicitly indicate the logger type you want to use.

This is a problem for people tracing rules through nfnetlink_log since
packets are always routed to the NF_LOG_TYPE logger after the
aforementioned patch.

We can fix this by removing the trace loginfo structures, but that still
changes the log level from 4 to 5 for tracing messages and there may be
someone relying on this outthere. So let's just introduce a new
nf_log_trace() function that restores the former behaviour.
