clocksource: efm32: Fix a NULL pointer dereference

The initialisation of the efm32 clocksource first sets up the irq and only
after that initialises the data needed for irq handling. In case this
initialisation is delayed the irq handler would dereference a NULL pointer.

I'm not aware of anything that could delay the process in such a way, but it's
better to be safe than sorry, so setup the irq only when the clock event device
is ready.
