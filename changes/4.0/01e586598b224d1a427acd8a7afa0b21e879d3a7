cgroup: release css->id after css_free

Currently, we release css->id in css_release_work_fn, right before calling
css_free callback, so that when css_free is called, the id may have
already been reused for a new cgroup.

I am going to use css->id to create unique names for per memcg kmem
caches.  Since kmem caches are destroyed only on css_free, I need css->id
to be freed after css_free was called to avoid name clashes.  This patch
therefore moves css->id removal to css_free_work_fn.  To prevent
css_from_id from returning a pointer to a stale css, it makes
css_release_work_fn replace the css ptr at css_idr:css->id with NULL.
