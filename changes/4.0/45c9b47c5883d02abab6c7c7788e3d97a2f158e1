KVM: s390/CPACF: Choose crypto control block format

We need to specify a different format for the crypto control block
depending on whether the APXA facility is installed or not. Let's
test for it by executing the PQAP(QCI) function and use either a
format-1 or a format-2 crypto control block accordingly. This is a
host only change for z13 and does not affect the guest view.
