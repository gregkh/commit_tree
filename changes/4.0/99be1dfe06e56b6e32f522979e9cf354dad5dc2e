drm/i915: Move intel_init_pipe_control out of engine->init_hw

With this all the ->init_hw hooks really only set up hw state needed
to start the ring, all the software state setup and memory/buffer
allocations happen beforehand.

v2: We need to call intel_init_pipe_control after the ring init since
otherwise engine->dev is NULL and it falls over. Currently that's
now after the hw ring is enabled but a) we'll be fine as long as no
one submits a batch b) this will change soon.
