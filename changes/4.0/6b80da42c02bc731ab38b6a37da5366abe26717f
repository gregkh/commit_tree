rcutorture: Use unsigned for Reader Batch computations

The counter returned by the various ->completed functions is subject to
overflow, which means that subtracting two such counters might result
in overflow, which invokes undefined behavior in the C standard.  This
commit therefore changes these functions and variables to unsigned to
avoid this undefined behavior.
