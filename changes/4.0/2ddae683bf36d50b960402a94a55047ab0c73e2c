lib/sort.c: move include inside #if 0

The sort function and its helpers don't do memory allocation, so the
slab.h include is redundant.  Move it inside the #if 0 protecting the
self-test, similar to how it is done in lib/list_sort.c.  This removes
over 450 lines from the generated dependency file.
