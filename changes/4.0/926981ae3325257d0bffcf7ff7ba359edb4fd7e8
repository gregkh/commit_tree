ALSA: hda: pass intel_hda to all i915 interface functions

chip is already passed to most of the i915 interface functions. Unify
the interface by passing intel_hda instead of chip and passing it to all
functions. Passing intel_hda instead of chip makes more sense since this
is an intel specific interface. Also in an upcoming patch we will use
intel_hda in all of these functions so by passing intel_hda we can save
on some pointer casts from chip to intel_hda.

This will be needed by an upcoming patch adding component support.

No functional change.

v2-3: unchanged
v4:
- pass intel_hda instead of chip
