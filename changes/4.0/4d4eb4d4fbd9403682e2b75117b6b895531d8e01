seq_buf: Fix seq_buf_bprintf() truncation

In seq_buf_bprintf(), bstr_printf() is used to copy the format into the
buffer remaining in the seq_buf structure. The return of bstr_printf()
is the amount of characters written to the buffer excluding the '\0',
unless the line was truncated!

If the line copied does not fit, it is truncated, and a '\0' is added
to the end of the buffer. But in this case, '\0' is included in the length
of the line written. To know if the buffer had overflowed, the return
length will be the same or greater than the length of the buffer passed in.

The check in seq_buf_bprintf() only checked if the length returned from
bstr_printf() would fit in the buffer, as the seq_buf_bprintf() is only
to be an all or nothing command. It either writes all the string into
the seq_buf, or none of it. If the string is truncated, the pointers
inside the seq_buf must be reset to what they were when the function was
called. This is not the case. On overflow, it copies only part of the string.

The fix is to change the overflow check to see if the length returned from
bstr_printf() is less than the length remaining in the seq_buf buffer, and not
if it is less than or equal to as it currently does. Then seq_buf_bprintf()
will know if the write from bstr_printf() was truncated or not.
