pm: at91: pm_slowclock: fix suspend/resume hang up in timeouts

Removed timeout on XTAL, PLL lock and Master Clock Ready, hang if
something went wrong instead of continuing in unknown condition. There
is not much we can do if a PLL lock never ends, we are running in SRAM
and we will not be able to connect back the sdram or ddram in order to
be able to fire up a message or just panic.

As a bonus, not decounting the timeout register in slow clock mode
reduce cumulated suspend time and resume time from ~17ms to ~15ms.
