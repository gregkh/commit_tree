xhci: Workaround for PME stuck issues in Intel xhci

The xhci in Intel Sunrisepoint and Cherryview platforms need a driver
workaround for a Stuck PME that might either block PME events in suspend,
or create spurious PME events preventing runtime suspend.

Workaround is to clear a internal PME flag, BIT(28) in a vendor specific
PMCTRL register at offset 0x80a4, in both suspend resume callbacks

Without this, xhci connected usb devices might never be able to wake up the
system from suspend, or prevent device from going to suspend (xhci d3)
