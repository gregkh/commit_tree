soc: ti: knav_qmss_queue: export API calls for use by user driver

Currently only few of the API calls are exported. This creates problem
when the knav* modules are built as modules and another user module
such as netcp_core try to use these API calls and they are also built
as module. This patch export these APIs to address the issue.

This is needed to support allmodconfig for ARM
