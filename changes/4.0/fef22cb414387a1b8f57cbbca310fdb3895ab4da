mfd: wm8994: Set mfd id-base for regulator devs creation to avoid conflicts

After commit: 6e3f62f0793e ("mfd: core: Fix platform-device id generation")
We must set the id base when register a duplicate name of mfd_cell.
If not, duplicate filename error was reported.

- sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/.../wm8994-ldo'
