ip: convert tcp_sendmsg() to iov_iter primitives

patch is actually smaller than it seems to be - most of it is unindenting
the inner loop body in tcp_sendmsg() itself...

the bit in tcp_input.c is going to get reverted very soon - that's what
memcpy_from_msg() will become, but not in this commit; let's keep it
reasonably contained...

There's one potentially subtle change here: in case of short copy from
userland, mainline tcp_send_syn_data() discards the skb it has allocated
and falls back to normal path, where we'll send as much as possible after
rereading the same data again.  This patch trims SYN+data skb instead -
that way we don't need to copy from the same place twice.
