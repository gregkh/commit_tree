serial: omap_8250: Fix RTS handling, part B

Because the OMAP3 UART ignores MCR[1] (RTS) in autoRTS mode, autoRTS
mode must not be enabled unless RTS is set (or port->mctrl & TIOCM_RTS,
which is equivalent).

Fixes premature raising of RTS in omap_8250_set_termios() -- RTS was
raised even before UART mode was selected.
Fixes raise of RTS after port has been shutdown; omap_8250_pm() re-enabled
RTS after omap_8250_shutdown().
