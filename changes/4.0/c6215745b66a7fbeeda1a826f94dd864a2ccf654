IB/mlx4: Load balance ports in port aggregation mode

When the mlx4 IB (RoCE) device works in link aggregation mode, it
exposes a single port to upper layers. Therefore, applications always
set '1' in port_num attribute when modifying a QP or creating an address handle.

To make sure that a node uses all available ports the mlx4 driver will
override the port_num attribute with a round robin policy.
