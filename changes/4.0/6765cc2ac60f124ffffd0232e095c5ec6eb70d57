s390/dasd: cleanup profiling

The dasd driver has a lot of duplicated code to handle
dasd_global_profile. With this patch we use the same code for the
global and the per device profiling data. Note that dasd_stats_write
had to change slightly to maintain some odd differences between
A) per device and global profile and B) proc and sysfs interface
usage.
