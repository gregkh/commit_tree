brcmfmac: fix nvram processing

The nvram file can hold a key=value combination in which the value
may have spaces, ie. 'RAW1=80 02 fe ff'. The parsing functionality
did not deal with this so it gives an error message:

[621746.311635] brcmfmac: brcmf_nvram_handle_key
	warning: ln=90:col=11: '=' expected, skip invalid key entry

because RAW1=80 is being considerd as key=value pair and it expects
'=' sign after '02' for next key=value pair. This entry can be
completely ignored as firmware does not need it.
