[media] gspca: Add high-speed modes for PS3 Eye camera

Add support in the PS3 Eye driver for QVGA capture at higher
frame rates: 187, 150, and 137 FPS. This functionality is valuable
because the PS3 Eye is popular for computer vision projects and no
other camera in its price range supports such high frame rates.

Correct a QVGA mode that was listed as 40 FPS. It is really 37 FPS
(half of 75 FPS).

Tests confirm that the nominal frame rates are achieved.
