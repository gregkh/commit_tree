Input: add new sun4i-lradc-keys driver

Allwinnner sunxi SoCs have a low resolution adc (called lradc) which is
specifically designed to have various (tablet) keys (ie home, back, search,
etc). attached to it using a resistor network. This adds a driver for this.

There are 2 channels, currently this driver only supports chan0 since there
are no boards known to use chan1.

This has been tested on an olimex a10s-olinuxino-micro, a13-olinuxino, and
a20-olinuxino-micro.
