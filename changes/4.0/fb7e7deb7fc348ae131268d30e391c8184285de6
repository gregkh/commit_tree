irqchip: gic: Allow interrupt level to be set for PPIs

During a recent cleanup of the arm64 DTs it has become clear that
the handling of PPIs in xxxx_set_type() is incorrect. The ARM TRMs
for GICv2 and later allow for "implementation defined" support for
setting the edge or level type of the PPI interrupts and don't restrict
the activation level of the signal. Current ARM implementations
do restrict the PPI level type to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW, but licensees
of the IP can decide to shoot themselves in the foot at any time.
