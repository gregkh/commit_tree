ARM: 8278/1: sa1100: split irq handling for low GPIOs

Low GPIO pins use an interrupt in SC interrupts space. However it's
possible to handle them as if all the GPIO interrupts are instead tied
to single GPIO handler, which later decodes GEDR register and
chain-calls next IRQ handler. So split first 11 interrupts into system
part (IRQ_GPIO0_SC - IRQ_GPIO10_SC) which work exactly like the rest of
system controller interrupts and real GPIO interrupts
(IRQ_GPIO0..IRQ_GPIO10). A single handler sa1100_gpio_handler then
decodes and calls next handler.
