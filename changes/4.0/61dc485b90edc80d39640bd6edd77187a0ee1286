ARM: integrator: Convert PCI to use generic config accessors

Convert the integrator PCI driver to use the generic config access
functions.

This changes accesses from __raw_readX/__raw_writeX to readX/writeX
variants.  The spinlock is removed because it is unnecessary.  The config
read and write functions are already protected with a spinlock and no
access can occur during the .pre_init function.
