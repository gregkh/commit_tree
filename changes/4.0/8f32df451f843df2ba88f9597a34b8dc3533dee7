[media] vino/saa7191: remove deprecated drivers

These drivers haven't been tested in a long, long time. The hardware is
ancient and hopelessly obsolete. These drivers also need to be converted
to newer media frameworks but due to the lack of hardware that's going
to be impossible.

So these drivers are a prime candidate for removal. If someone is
interested in working on these drivers to prevent their removal, then
please contact the linux-media mailinglist.

These drivers are already deprecated, so now remove them altogether.
