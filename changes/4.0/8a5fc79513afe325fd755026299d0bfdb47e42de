hwmon: (ina2xx) make shunt resistance configurable at run-time

The shunt resistance can only be set via platform_data or device tree. This
isn't suitable for devices in which the shunt resistance can change/isn't
known at boot-time.

Add a sysfs attribute that allows to read and set the shunt resistance.
