ALSA: pcm: Use __ffs() instead of ffs() in snd_mask_min()

The difference between __ffs and ffs is that ffs will return a one based
index whereas __ffs will return a zero based index. Furthermore ffs will
check if the passed value is zero and return zero in that case, whereas
__ffs behavior is undefined if the passed parameter is 0.

Since we already check if the mask is 0 before calling ffs and also subtract
1 from the result __ffs is the better choice.
