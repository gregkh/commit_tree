drm/edid: set ELD for firmware and debugfs override EDIDs

If the user supplies EDID through firmware or debugfs override, the
driver callbacks are bypassed and the connector ELD does not get
updated, and audio fails. Set ELD for firmware and debugfs EDIDs too.

There should be no harm in gratuitously doing this for non HDMI/DP
connectors, as it's still up to the driver to use the ELD, if any.
