Don't leak a key reference if request_key() tries to use a revoked keyring

If a request_key() call to allocate and fill out a key attempts to insert the
key structure into a revoked keyring, the key will leak, using memory and part
of the user's key quota until the system reboots. This is from a failure of
construct_alloc_key() to decrement the key's reference count after the attempt
to insert into the requested keyring is rejected.

key_put() needs to be called in the link_prealloc_failed callpath to ensure
the unused key is released.
