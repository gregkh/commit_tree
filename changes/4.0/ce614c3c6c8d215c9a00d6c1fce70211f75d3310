powerpc/mm: fix undefined reference to `.__kernel_map_pages' on FSL PPC64

arch/powerpc has __kernel_map_pages implementations in mm/pgtable_32.c, and
mm/hash_utils_64.c, of which the former is built for PPC32, and the latter
for PPC64 machines with PPC_STD_MMU.  Fix arch/powerpc/Kconfig to not select
ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC when CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64 isn't defined,
i.e., for 64-bit book3e builds to use the generic __kernel_map_pages()
in mm/debug-pagealloc.c.
