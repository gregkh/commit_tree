cpufreq: stats: don't check for freq table while freeing stats

While we allocate stats, we do need to check if freq-table is present
or not as we need to use it then. But while freeing stats, all we need
to know is if stats holds a valid pointer value. There is no use of
testing if cpufreq table is present or not.

Don't check it.
