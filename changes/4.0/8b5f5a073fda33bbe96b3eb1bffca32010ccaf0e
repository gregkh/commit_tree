arm64: Don't use is_module_addr in setting page attributes

The set_memory_* functions currently only support module
addresses. The addresses are validated using is_module_addr.
That function is special though and relies on internal state
in the module subsystem to work properly. At the time of
module initialization and calling set_memory_*, it's too early
for is_module_addr to work properly so it always returns
false. Rather than be subject to the whims of the module state,
just bounds check against the module virtual address range.
