perf: Fix put_event() ctx lock

So what I suspect; but I'm in zombie mode today it seems; is that while
I initially thought that it was impossible for ctx to change when
refcount dropped to 0, I now suspect its possible.

Note that until perf_remove_from_context() the event is still active and
visible on the lists. So a concurrent sys_perf_event_open() from another
task into this task can race.
