hexdump: fix ascii column for the tail of a dump

In the current implementation we have a floating ascii column in the tail
of the dump.

For example, for row size equal to 16 the ascii column as in following
table

group size \ length	8	12	16
	1		50	50	50
	2		22	32	42
	4		20	29	38
	8		19	-	36

This patch makes it the same independently of amount of bytes dumped.

The change is safe since all current users, which use ASCII part of the
dump, rely on the group size equal to 1.  The patch doesn't change
behaviour for such group size (see the table above).
