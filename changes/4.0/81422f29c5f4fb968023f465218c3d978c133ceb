mm: more checks on free_pages_prepare() for tail pages

Although it was not called, destroy_compound_page() did some potentially
useful checks.  Let's re-introduce them in free_pages_prepare(), where
they can be actually triggered when CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y.

compound_order() assert is already in free_pages_prepare().  We have few
checks for tail pages left.
