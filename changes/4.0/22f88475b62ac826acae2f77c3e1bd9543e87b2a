Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: Fix a locking bug in the balloon driver

We support memory hot-add in the Hyper-V balloon driver by hot adding an appropriately
sized and aligned region and controlling the on-lining of pages within that region
based on the pages that the host wants us to online. We do this because the
granularity and alignment requirements in Linux are different from what Windows
expects. The state to manage the onlining of pages needs to be correctly
protected. Fix this bug.
