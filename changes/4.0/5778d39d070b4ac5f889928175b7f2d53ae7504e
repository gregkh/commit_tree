net_sched: fix struct tc_u_hnode layout in u32

We dynamically allocate divisor+1 entries for ->ht[] in tc_u_hnode:

  ht = kzalloc(sizeof(*ht) + divisor*sizeof(void *), GFP_KERNEL);

So ->ht is supposed to be the last field of this struct, however
this is broken, since an rcu head is appended after it.
