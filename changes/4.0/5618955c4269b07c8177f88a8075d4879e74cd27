ALSA: fm801: move to pcim_* and devm_* functions

The managed functions allow to get ->probe() and ->remove() simplier.
This patch converts code to use managed functions.

While here remove the dead code and fix the value printed in error
message.

[removed pci_release_regions() as it's managed in pcim_release(), too
