ALSA: Add a helper to add a new attribute group to card

For assigning sysfs entries for a card device from the driver,
introduce a new helper function, snd_card_add_dev_attr().  In this
way, we can avoid the possible race between the device registration
and the sysfs addition / removal.

The driver can pass a new attribute group to add freely.  This has to
be called before snd_card_register().

Currently, up to two extra groups can be added.  More than that, it'll
return an error.
