toshiba_acpi: Drop the toshiba_ prefix from sysfs function names

This patch removes the toshiba_ prefix from all the sysfs function
names and adapted the code according to coding style.

Also a few functions were renamed to match the sysfs entry, as this
patch is a preparation for the next patch to switch to
DEVICE_ATTR_{RO, RW, WO} macros.
