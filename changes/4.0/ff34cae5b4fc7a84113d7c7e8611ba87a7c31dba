ARM: BCM: put back ARCH_MULTI_V7 dependency for mobile

A recent cleanup rearranged the Kconfig file for mach-bcm and
accidentally dropped the dependency on ARCH_MULTI_V7, which
makes it possible to now build the two mobile SoC platforms
on an ARMv6-only kernel, resulting in a log of Kconfig
warnings like

warning: ARCH_BCM_MOBILE selects ARM_ERRATA_775420 which has unmet direct dependencies (CPU_V7)

and which of course cannot work on any machine.

This puts back the dependencies as before.
