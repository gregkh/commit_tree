dm crypt: sort writes

Write requests are sorted in a red-black tree structure and are
submitted in the sorted order.

In theory the sorting should be performed by the underlying disk
scheduler, however, in practice the disk scheduler only accepts and
sorts a finite number of requests.  To allow the sorting of all
requests, dm-crypt needs to implement its own sorting.

The overhead associated with rbtree-based sorting is considered
negligible so it is not used conditionally.  Even on SSD sorting can be
beneficial since in-order request dispatch promotes lower latency IO
completion to the upper layers.
