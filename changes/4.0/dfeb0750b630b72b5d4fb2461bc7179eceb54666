kernfs: remove KERNFS_STATIC_NAME

When a new kernfs node is created, KERNFS_STATIC_NAME is used to avoid
making a separate copy of its name.  It's currently only used for sysfs
attributes whose filenames are required to stay accessible and unchanged.
There are rare exceptions where these names are allocated and formatted
dynamically but for the vast majority of cases they're consts in the
rodata section.

Now that kernfs is converted to use kstrdup_const() and kfree_const(),
there's little point in keeping KERNFS_STATIC_NAME around.  Remove it.
