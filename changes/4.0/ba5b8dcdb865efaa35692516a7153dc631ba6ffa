fm10k: Clean-up page reuse code

This patch cleans up the page reuse code getting it into a state where all
the workarounds needed are in place as well as cleaning up a few minor
oversights such as using __free_pages instead of put_page to drop a locally
allocated page.

It also cleans up how we clear the descriptor status bits.  Previously they
were zeroed as a part of clearing the hdr_addr.  However the hdr_addr is a
64 bit field and 64 bit writes can be a bit more expensive on on 32 bit
systems.  Since we are no longer using the header split feature the upper
32 bits of the address no longer need to be cleared.  As a result we can
just clear the status bits and leave the length and VLAN fields as-is which
should provide more information in debugging.
