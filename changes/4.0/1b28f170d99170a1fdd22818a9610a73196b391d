powerpc/eeh: Allow to set maximal frozen times

When PE's frozen count hits maximal allowed frozen times, which is
5 currently, it will be forced to be offline permanently. Once the
PE is removed permanently, rebooting machine is required to bring
the PE back. It's not convienent when testing EEH functionality.

The patch exports the maximal allowed frozen times through debugfs
entry (/sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/eeh_max_freezes).
