Btrfs: Separate finding-right-mirror and writing-to-target's process in scrub_handle_errored_block()

In corrent code, code of finding-right-mirror and writing-to-target
are mixed in logic, if we find a right mirror but failed in writing
to target, it will treat as "hadn't found right block", and fill the
target with sblock_bad.

Actually, "failed in writing to target" does not mean "source
block is wrong", this patch separate above two condition in logic,
and do some cleanup to make code clean.
