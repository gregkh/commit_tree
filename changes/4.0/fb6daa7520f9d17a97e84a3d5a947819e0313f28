kdb: Provide forward search at more prompt

Currently kdb allows the output of comamnds to be filtered using the
| grep feature. This is useful but does not permit the output emitted
shortly after a string match to be examined without wading through the
entire unfiltered output of the command. Such a feature is particularly
useful to navigate function traces because these traces often have a
useful trigger string *before* the point of interest.

This patch reuses the existing filtering logic to introduce a simple
forward search to kdb that can be triggered from the more prompt.
