cpufreq: speedstep-smi: enable interrupts when waiting

On Dell Latitude C600 laptop with Pentium 3 850MHz processor, the
speedstep-smi driver sometimes loads and sometimes doesn't load with
"change to state X failed" message.

The hardware sometimes refuses to change frequency and in this case, we
need to retry later. I found out that we need to enable interrupts while
waiting. When we enable interrupts, the hardware blockage that prevents
frequency transition resolves and the transition is possible. With
disabled interrupts, the blockage doesn't resolve (no matter how long do
we wait). The exact reasons for this hardware behavior are unknown.

This patch enables interrupts in the function speedstep_set_state that can
be called with disabled interrupts. However, this function is called with
disabled interrupts only from speedstep_get_freqs, so it shouldn't cause
any problem.
