ARM: shmobile: R-Mobile: Special-case PM domains with memory-controllers

Add a special case for PM domains containing a memory-controller.
Such a PM domain must not be turned off if memory is in use.

On sh73a0 PM domains A4BC0 and A4BC1 each contain an SDRAM Bus State
Controller (SBSC). On r8a73a4 PM domain A3BC contains two DDR Bus
Controllers (DBSC).  In both cases, there are no other devices in these
PM domains, so they were eligible for power down, crashing the system.

On r8a7740 the DDR3 Bus State Controller (DBSC3) is located in A4S,
whose child domain A3SM contains the CPU core. Hence A4S is never turned
off, and no crash happened.
