cxl: Disable SPAP register when freeing SPA

When we deactivate the AFU directed mode we free the scheduled process
area, but did not clear the register in the hardware that has a pointer
to it.

This should be fine since we will have already cleared out every context
and we won't do anything that would cause the hardware to access it
until after we have allocated a new one, but just to be safe this patch
clears out the register when we free the page.
