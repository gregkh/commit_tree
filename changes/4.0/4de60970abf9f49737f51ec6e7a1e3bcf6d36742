gpiolib: translate pin number in GPIO ACPI callbacks

If GPIO driver use pin mapping, need to translate pin number
between ACPI table and GPIO driver.

This issue is found on one platform with Cherryview gpio
controller, kernel is hang when executed _PS0 method of
one ACPI device, since without this translation, it access
invalid gpiodesc array.

Verified it works again with this patch.
