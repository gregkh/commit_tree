drm/i915: Stop putting GGTT VMA at the head of the list

Multiple GGTT VMAs per object will be introduced in the near future which will
make it impossible to guarantee normal GGTT view is at the head of the list.

Purpose of this patch is to break this assumption straight away so any
potential hidden assumptions in the code base can be bisected to this
simple patch.
