misc: ioc4: simplify wave period measurement in clock_calibrate

The loop for measuring the square wave periods over some cycles is
refactored to be more easily readable. This includes avoiding a
"by-hand-implemented" for loop with a "real" one and adding some
comments.

Furthermore the following compiler warning is avoided by this patch:
drivers/misc/ioc4.c: In function ‘ioc4_probe’:
drivers/misc/ioc4.c:194:16: warning: ‘start’ may be used uninitialized
in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  period = (end - start) /
                ^
drivers/misc/ioc4.c:148:11: note: ‘start’ was declared here
  uint64_t start, end, period;
           ^
