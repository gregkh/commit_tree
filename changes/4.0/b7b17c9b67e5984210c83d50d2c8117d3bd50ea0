md: remove mddev_lock() from md_attr_show()

Most attributes can be read safely without any locking.
A race might lead to a slightly out-dated value, but nothing wrong.

We already have locking in some places where needed.
All that remains is can_clear_show(), behind_writes_used_show()
and action_show() which are easily fixed.
