ARM: dts: add 'dr_mode' property to hsotg devices for exynos boards

All currently supported boards use hsotg/dwc2 controller in device
('peripheral') mode, so add property which sets correct operation mode.
This patch fixes support in recent changes in dwc2 driver, which added
support for dual-role devices.
