hso: move tty_unregister outside hso_serial_common_free()

The function hso_serial_common_free() is called either by the cleanup
method of the tty or by the usb disconnect method.
In the former case, the usb_disconnect() has been already called
and the sysfs group associated to the device has been removed.
By calling tty_unregister directly from the usb_disconnect() method,
we avoid a warning due to the removal of the sysfs group of the usb
device.

Example of warning:
