ALSA: usb-audio: Don't attempt to get Lifecam HD-5000 sample rate

Adds a quirk to disable the check that the sample rate has been set correctly, as the Lifecam does not support getting the sample rate.

This means that we don't need to wait for the USB timeout when attempting to get the sample rate. Waiting for the timeout causes problems in some applications, which give up on the device acquisition process before it has had time to complete, resulting in no sound.
