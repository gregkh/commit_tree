Btrfs: abort the transaction if we fail to update the free space cache inode

Our gluster boxes were hitting a problem where they'd run out of space when
updating the block group cache and therefore wouldn't be able to update the free
space inode.  This is a problem because this is how we invalidate the cache and
protect ourselves from errors further down the stack, so if this fails we have
to abort the transaction so we make sure we don't end up with stale free space
cache.  Thanks,
