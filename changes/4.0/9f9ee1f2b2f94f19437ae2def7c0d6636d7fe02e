block: Quiesce zeroout wrapper

blkdev_issue_zeroout() printed a warning if a device failed a discard or
write same request despite advertising support for these. That's fine
for SCSI since we'll disable these commands if we get an error back from
the disk saying that they are not supported. And consequently the
warning only gets printed once.

There are other types of block devices that support discard, however,
and these may return -EOPNOTSUPP for each command but leave discard
enabled in the queue limits. This will cause a warning message for every
blkdev_issue_zeroout() invocation.

Remove the offending warning messages.
