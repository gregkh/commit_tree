ALSA: firewire-lib: fix an unexpected byte sequence for micro sign

The sign for microsecond (U+0085, MICRO SIGN) was encoded to '0x c2 b5'
by UTF-8 character encoding scheme. But the byte sequence was converted
to '0x c3 82 c2 b5' in a previous commit. As a result, the byte
sequence cannot represent microsecond sign in UTF-8 or ASCII. This
may confuse developers.

This commit replaces the sign to string expression with 'microseconds'
to purge superfluous troubles.
