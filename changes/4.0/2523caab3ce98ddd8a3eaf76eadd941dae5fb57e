Input: cyapa - remove superfluous type check in cyapa_gen5_read_idac_data()

drivers/input/mouse/cyapa_gen5.c: In function ‘cyapa_gen5_read_idac_data’:
drivers/input/mouse/cyapa_gen5.c:1876: warning: ‘max_element_cnt’ may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/input/mouse/cyapa_gen5.c:1873: warning: ‘offset’ may be used uninitialized in this function

If *data_size is non-zero, and idac_data_type contains an unknown type,
max_element_cnt and offset will be uninitialized, and the loop will
process non-existing data.

However, this cannot happen (for now), as there's a test for unknown
types at the top of cyapa_gen5_read_idac_data().

As no "if ... else if ..." is used in other places, remove the
superfluous "if" to silence the compiler warning.
