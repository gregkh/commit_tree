ARM: dts: tegra20: fix GR3D, DSI unit and reg base addresses

Commit 58ecb23f64ee ("ARM: tegra: add missing unit addresses to DT") added
unit address and changed reg base for GR3D and DSI host1x modules, but these
addresses belongs to GR2D and TVO modules respectively. Fix it by changing
modules unit and reg base addresses to proper ones.
