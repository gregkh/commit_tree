arm64: kvm: move to ESR_ELx macros

Now that we have common ESR_ELx macros, make use of them in the arm64
KVM code. The addition of <asm/esr.h> to the include path highlighted
badly ordered (i.e. not alphabetical) include lists; these are changed
to alphabetical order.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
