ALSA: line6: Clear prev_fbuf and prev_fsize properly

Clearing prev_fsize in line6_pcm_acquire() is pretty racy.
This can be called at any time while the stream is being played.
Rather better to clear prev_fbuf and prev_fsize at the proper place
like the stream stop for capture, and just after copying the monitor /
impulse data inside the spinlock.
