Input: tc3589x-keypad - set IRQF_ONESHOT flag to ensure IRQ request

Since commit 1c6c69525b40eb76de8adf039409722015927dc3 ("genirq: Reject
bogus threaded irq requests") threaded IRQs without a primary handler
need to be requested with IRQF_ONESHOT, otherwise the request will fail.

Currently, plat->irqtype is only set to IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING.  This
patch sets the ONESHOT flag directly in request_threaded_irq() to
enforce the flag without being affected by future changes to
plat->irqtype.
