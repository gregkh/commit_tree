tipc: convert legacy nl bearer dump to nl compat

Introduce a framework for dumping netlink data from the new netlink
API and formatting it to the old legacy API format. This is done by
looping the dump data and calling a format handler for each entity, in
this case a bearer.

We dump until either all data is dumped or we reach the limited buffer
size of the legacy API. Remember, the legacy API doesn't scale.

In this commit we convert TIPC_CMD_GET_BEARER_NAMES to use the compat
layer.
