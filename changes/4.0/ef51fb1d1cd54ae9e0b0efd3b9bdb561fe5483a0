cfg80211: avoid reg-hints in self-managed only systems

When a system contains only self-managed regulatory devices all hints
from the regulatory core are ignored. Stop hint processing early in this
case. These systems usually don't have CRDA deployed, which results in
endless (irrelevent) logs of the form:
cfg80211: Calling CRDA to update world regulatory domain

Make sure there's at least one self-managed device before discarding a
hint, in order to prevent initial hints from disappearing on CRDA
managed systems.
