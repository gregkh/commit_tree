drm/mst: fix recursive sleep warning on qlock

With drm-next, we can get a backtrace from sleeping
with mutex detection.

this is due to the callback checking the txmsg state taking
the mutex, which can cause a sleep inside a sleep,

Daniel went over it and was happy we could drop this mutex
in this case.
