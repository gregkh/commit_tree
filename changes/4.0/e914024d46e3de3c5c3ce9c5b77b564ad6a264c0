staging: rtl8188eu: odm: conditional setting with no effect

The if and the else branch code are identical - so the condition has no
effect on the effective code - this patch removes the condition and the
duplicated code. Due to this being a fall-through-if here - the first
if condition has no effect either - so it also can be removed.
struct mlme_priv is thus also no longer needed here.
