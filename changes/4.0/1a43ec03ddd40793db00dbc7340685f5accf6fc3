xfs: Keep sb_bad_features2 consistent with sb_features2

Currently when we modify sb_features2, we store the same value also in
sb_bad_features2. However in most places we forget to mark field
sb_bad_features2 for logging and thus it can happen that a change to it
is lost. This results in an inconsistent sb_features2 and
sb_bad_features2 fields e.g. after xfstests test xfs/187.

Fix the problem by changing XFS_SB_FEATURES2 to actually mean both
sb_features2 and sb_bad_features2 fields since this is always what we
want to log. This isn't ideal because the fact that XFS_SB_FEATURES2
means two fields could cause some problem in future however the code is
hopefully less error prone that it is now.
