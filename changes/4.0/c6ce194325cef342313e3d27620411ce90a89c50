cfq-iosched: fix incorrect filing of rt async cfqq

Hi,

If you can manage to submit an async write as the first async I/O from
the context of a process with realtime scheduling priority, then a
cfq_queue is allocated, but filed into the wrong async_cfqq bucket.  It
ends up in the best effort array, but actually has realtime I/O
scheduling priority set in cfqq->ioprio.

The reason is that cfq_get_queue assumes the default scheduling class and
priority when there is no information present (i.e. when the async cfqq
is created):

static struct cfq_queue *
cfq_get_queue(struct cfq_data *cfqd, bool is_sync, struct cfq_io_cq *cic,
	      struct bio *bio, gfp_t gfp_mask)
{
	const int ioprio_class = IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
	const int ioprio = IOPRIO_PRIO_DATA(cic->ioprio);

cic->ioprio starts out as 0, which is "invalid".  So, class of 0
(IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE) is passed to cfq_async_queue_prio like so:

		async_cfqq = cfq_async_queue_prio(cfqd, ioprio_class, ioprio);

static struct cfq_queue **
cfq_async_queue_prio(struct cfq_data *cfqd, int ioprio_class, int ioprio)
{
        switch (ioprio_class) {
        case IOPRIO_CLASS_RT:
                return &cfqd->async_cfqq[0][ioprio];
        case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
                ioprio = IOPRIO_NORM;
                /* fall through */
        case IOPRIO_CLASS_BE:
                return &cfqd->async_cfqq[1][ioprio];
        case IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE:
                return &cfqd->async_idle_cfqq;
        default:
                BUG();
        }
}

Here, instead of returning a class mapped from the process' scheduling
priority, we get back the bucket associated with IOPRIO_CLASS_BE.

Now, there is no queue allocated there yet, so we create it:

		cfqq = cfq_find_alloc_queue(cfqd, is_sync, cic, bio, gfp_mask);

That function ends up doing this:

			cfq_init_cfqq(cfqd, cfqq, current->pid, is_sync);
			cfq_init_prio_data(cfqq, cic);

cfq_init_cfqq marks the priority as having changed.  Then, cfq_init_prio
data does this:

	ioprio_class = IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
	switch (ioprio_class) {
	default:
		printk(KERN_ERR "cfq: bad prio %x\n", ioprio_class);
	case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
		/*
		 * no prio set, inherit CPU scheduling settings
		 */
		cfqq->ioprio = task_nice_ioprio(tsk);
		cfqq->ioprio_class = task_nice_ioclass(tsk);
		break;

So we basically have two code paths that treat IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE
differently, which results in an RT async cfqq filed into a best effort
bucket.

Attached is a patch which fixes the problem.  I'm not sure how to make
it cleaner.  Suggestions would be welcome.
