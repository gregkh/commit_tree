drm/i915: Change VLV WIZ hashing mode to 16x4

We set the WIZ hashing mode to 16x4 for all the other gen6+
platfotrms, so let's follow suit on VLV.

My VLV is AWOL currently so I didn't test this, but since the results
for all the other platforms agree that 16x4 is the fastest we might
assume the same holds for VLV.
