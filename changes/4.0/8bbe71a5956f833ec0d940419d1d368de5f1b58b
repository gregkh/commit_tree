bonding: fix bond_open() don't always set slave active flag

Mode 802.3ad, fix incorrect bond slave active state when slave is not in
active aggregator. During bond_open(), the bonding driver always sets
the slave active flag to true if the bond is not in active-backup, alb,
or tlb modes. Bonding should let the aggregator selection logic set the
active flag when in 802.3ad mode.
