PCI: Fix infinite loop with ROM image of size 0

If the image size would ever read as 0, pci_get_rom_size() could keep
processing the same image over and over again.  Exit the loop if we ever
read a length of zero.

This fixes a soft lockup on boot when the radeon driver calls
pci_get_rom_size() on an AMD Radeon R7 250X PCIe discrete graphics card.
