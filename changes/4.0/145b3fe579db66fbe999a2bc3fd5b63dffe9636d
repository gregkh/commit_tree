PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias var in uevent

Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.

The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
r3.0, Appendix D.  Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
alpha characters, so they won't be affected.  For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
20h, etc. are unaffected.

Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.

Commit 89ec3dcf17fd ("PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface
class") fixed only half of the problem.  Some udev implementations rely on
the uevent file and not the modalias file.
