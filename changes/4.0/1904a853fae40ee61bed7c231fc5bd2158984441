Bluetooth: Add opcode parameter to hci_req_complete_t callback

When hci_req_run() calls its provided complete function and one of the
HCI commands in the sequence fails, then provide the opcode of failing
command. In case of success HCI_OP_NOP is provided since all commands
completed.

This patch fixes the prototype of hci_req_complete_t and all its users.
