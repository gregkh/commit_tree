i40e: limit sriov to partition 1 of NPAR configurations

Make sure we only allow SR/IOV on the master PF of a port in multifunction
mode.  This should be the case anyway based on the num_vfs configured in
the NVM, but this will help make sure there's no question.  If we're not
in multifunction mode the partition_id will always be 1.
