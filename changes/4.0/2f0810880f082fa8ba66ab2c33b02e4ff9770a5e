btrfs: delete chunk allocation attemp when setting block group ro

Below test will fail currently:
      mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sda
      btrfs-convert /dev/sda
      mount /dev/sda /mnt
      btrfs device add -f /dev/sdb /mnt
      btrfs balance start -v -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 /mnt

The reason is there are some block groups with usage 0, but the whole
disk hasn't free space to allocate new chunk, so we even can't set such
block group readonly. This patch deletes the chunk allocation when
setting block group ro. For META, we already have reserve. But for
SYSTEM, we don't have, so the check_system_chunk is still required.
