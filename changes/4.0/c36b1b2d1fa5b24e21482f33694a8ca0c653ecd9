tpm/tpm_i2c_stm_st33: Add devicetree structure

Add tpm_stm_st33_i2c dts structure keeping backward compatibility
with static platform_data support as well.
In the mean time to easy this update and to make it much simpler, we:
- Moved all gpio_request to devm_gpio_request_one primitive
- Moved request_irq to devm_request_irq
