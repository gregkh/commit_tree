staging: comedi: pcl812: use common function to setup dma

The pcl812_ai_setup_dma() and pcl812_ai_setup_next_dma() functions are similar
other than the buffer switch and the inclusion of the "unread_samples" in
pcl818_ai_setup_next_dma() when calculating the dma size.

Merge these two functions by initializing the 'dma->cur_dma' in the callers
and passing '0' for the "unread_samples" when first starting the DMA.
