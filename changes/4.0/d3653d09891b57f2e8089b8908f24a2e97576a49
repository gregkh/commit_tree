iio: accel: kxcjk-1013: always power on device in resume

When the system resumes, it will first call system resume and
then runtime suspend (if CONFIG_RUNTIME_PM is enabled).
There is no need to conditionally power on the device in
system resume, so always power it on and leave runtime
suspend to power it off if needed.
