iio: mxs-lradc: only update the buffer when its conversions have finished

Using the touchscreen while running buffered capture results in the
buffer reporting lots of wrong values, often just zeros. This is because
we push readings to the buffer every time a touchscreen interrupt
arrives, including when the buffer's own conversions have not yet
finished. So let's only push to the buffer when its conversions are
ready.
