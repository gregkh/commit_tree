Btrfs: fix a out-of-bound access of raid_map

We add the number of stripes on target devices into bbio->num_stripes
if we are under device replacement, and we just sort the raid_map of
those stripes that not on the target devices, so if when we need
real raid_map, we need skip the stripes on the target devices.
