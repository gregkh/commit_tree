audit: replace getname()/putname() hacks with reference counters

In order to ensure that filenames are not released before the audit
subsystem is done with the strings there are a number of hacks built
into the fs and audit subsystems around getname() and putname().  To
say these hacks are "ugly" would be kind.

This patch removes the filename hackery in favor of a more
conventional reference count based approach.  The diffstat below tells
most of the story; lots of audit/fs specific code is replaced with a
traditional reference count based approach that is easily understood,
even by those not familiar with the audit and/or fs subsystems.
