ARM: dts: pcduino: Enable user LED and button support for pcDuino

The pcDuino board has LEDs connected to PH15/PH16, and back/home/menu
buttons to PH17/18/19 respectively. Enable these via gpio-leds and
gpio-keys. This is shared across the v1 and v2 versions of the board.

Tested on a v2 and verified against the schematics of a v1.
