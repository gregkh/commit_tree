lguest: use the PCI console device's emerg_wr for early boot messages.

This involves manually checking the console device (which is always in
slot 1 of bus 0) and using the window in VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG to
program it (as we can't map the BAR yet).

We could in fact do this much earlier, but we wait for the first
write from the virtio_cons_early_init() facility.
