ARM: dts: sun8i: Add dts file for Ippo Q8H v1.2 tablets

The Ippo Q8H v1.2 is almost identical to the v5, still it needs a separate
dtb file since some gpio-s surrounding the wlan/bluetooth are different,
it uses different camera sensors, and different DRAM timings.

Note that atm neither the wlan/bluetooth nor the camera are supported, so
atm their is no difference between the dts files, but because of the different
DRAM timings there are already separate u-boot configs for the 2 different
versions, and the 1.2 config refers to sun8i-a23-ippo-q8h-v1.2.dtb to be
future proof, so we need to provide a sun8i-a23-ippo-q8h-v1.2.dtb file.
