KVM: nVMX: Prepare for using hardware MSR bitmap

Currently, if L1 enables MSR_BITMAP, we will emulate this feature, all
of L2's msr access is intercepted by L0.  Features like "virtualize
x2apic mode" require that the MSR bitmap is enabled, or the hardware
will exit and for example not virtualize the x2apic MSRs.  In order to
let L1 use these features, we need to build a merged bitmap that only
not cause a VMEXIT if 1) L1 requires that 2) the bit is not required by
the processor for APIC virtualization.

For now the guests are still run with MSR bitmap disabled, but this
patch already introduces nested_vmx_merge_msr_bitmap for future use.
