PM / Domains: Re-order initialization of generic_pm_domain_data

Move the initialization of the struct generic_pm_domain_data into
genpd_alloc_dev_data(), including the assignment of the device's
->pm_domain() callback. Make corresponding changes to
genpd_free_dev_data().

These changes will make the related code more readable. It will also
decrease the critical regions for where genpd's mutex is being held and
for where the device's power related spinlock is being held.
