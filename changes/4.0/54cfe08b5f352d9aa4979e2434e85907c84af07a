mn10300: drop dead code

pci-iomap.c was (apparently, mistakenly) reintroduced as part of
commit 83c2dc15ce824450e7044b9f90cd529c25747ae0
    MN10300: Handle cacheable PCI regions in pci_iomap()
probably as side-effect of forward-porting the patch
from an old kernel.

It's not really needed: the generic pci_iomap does the right thing here.

The new file isn't compiled so it's safe to drop.
