nfs41: serialize first layoutget of a file

Per RFC 5661 Errata 3208:
| A client MAY always forget its layout state and associated
| layout stateid at any time (See also section 12.5.5.1).
| In such case, the client MUST use a non-layout stateid for the next
| LAYOUTGET operation. This will signal the server that the client has
| no more layouts on the file and its respective layout state can be
| released before issuing a new layout in response to LAYOUTGET.

In order to make such a signal unique to server, client needs to serialize
all layoutgets using non-layout stateid. We implement this by serializing
layoutgets when client has no layout segments at hand.
