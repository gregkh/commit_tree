mac80211: ignore CSA to same channel

If the AP is confused and starts doing a CSA to the same channel,
just ignore that request instead of trying to act it out since it
was likely sent in error anyway.

In the case of the bug I was investigating the GO was misbehaving
and sending out a beacon with CSA IEs still included after having
actually done the channel switch.
