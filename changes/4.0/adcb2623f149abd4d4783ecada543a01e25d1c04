ACPI / cpuidle: Clean up fallback to C1 checks

acpi_idle_enter_simple() and acpi_idle_enter_bm() both check
if C2/C3 type entry is supported on MP in the same way, so move
those checks to a separate function and call it from both
places (and it doesn't need to check if the state type is not
C1, because the functions in question won't be called otherwise).

While at it, use IS_ENABLED() for the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU check.
