lib/list_sort.c: rearrange includes

Memory allocation only happens in the self test, just as random numbers
are only used there.  So move the inclusion of slab.h inside the
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT.

We don't need module.h and all of the stuff it carries with it, so replace
with export.h and compiler.h.  Unfortunately, the ARRAY_SIZE macro from
kernel.h requires the user to ensure bug.h is also included (for
BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO, used by __must_be_array).  We used to get that through
some maze of nested includes, but just include it explicitly.

linux/string.h is then only included implicitly through
kernel.h->printk.h->dynamic_debug.h, but only if !CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG, so
just include it explicitly (for memset).

objdump -d says the generated code is the same, and wc -l says that
lib/.list_sort.o.cmd went from 579 to 165 lines.
