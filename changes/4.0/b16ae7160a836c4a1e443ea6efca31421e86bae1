NFC: nci: Support all destinations type when creating a connection

The current implementation limits nci_core_conn_create_req()
to only manage NCI_DESTINATION_NFCEE.
Add new parameters to nci_core_conn_create() to support all
destination types described in the NCI specification.
Because there are some parameters with variable size dynamic
buffer allocation is needed.
