KVM: x86: Add new dirty logging kvm_x86_ops for PML

This patch adds new kvm_x86_ops dirty logging hooks to enable/disable dirty
logging for particular memory slot, and to flush potentially logged dirty GPAs
before reporting slot->dirty_bitmap to userspace.

kvm x86 common code calls these hooks when they are available so PML logic can
be hidden to VMX specific. SVM won't be impacted as these hooks remain NULL
there.
