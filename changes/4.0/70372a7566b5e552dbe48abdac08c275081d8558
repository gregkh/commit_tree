ALSA: pcm: Don't leave PREPARED state after draining

When a PCM draining is performed to an empty stream that has been
already in PREPARED state, the current code just ignores and leaves as
it is, although the drain is supposed to set all such streams to SETUP
state.  This patch covers that overlooked case.
