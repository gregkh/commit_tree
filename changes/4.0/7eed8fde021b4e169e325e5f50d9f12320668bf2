lib/string_helpers.c:string_get_size(): remove redundant prefixes

While commit 3c9f3681d0b4 ("[SCSI] lib: add generic helper to print
sizes rounded to the correct SI range") says that Z and Y are included
in preparation for 128 bit computers, they just waste .text currently.
If and when we get u128, string_get_size needs updating anyway (and ISO
needs to come up with four more prefixes).

Also there's no need to include and test for the NULL sentinel; once we
reach "E" size is at most 18.  [The test is also wrong; it should be
units_str[units][i+1]; if we've reached NULL we're already doomed.]
