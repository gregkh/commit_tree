iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Fix self-test WARNs on i386

Various build/boot bots have reported WARNs being triggered by the ARM
iopgtable LPAE self-tests on i386 machines.

This boils down to two instances of right-shifting a 32-bit unsigned
long (i.e. an iova) by more than the size of the type. On 32-bit ARM,
this happens to give us zero, hence my testing didn't catch this
earlier.

This patch fixes the issue by using DIV_ROUND_UP and explicit case to
to avoid the erroneous shifts.
