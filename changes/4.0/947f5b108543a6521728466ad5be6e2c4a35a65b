clk: at91: implement suspend/resume for the PMC irqchip

The irq line used by the PMC block is shared with several peripherals
including the init timer which is registering its handler with
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND.

Implement the appropriate suspend/resume callback for the PMC irqchip,
and inform irq core that PMC irq handler can be safely called while
the system is suspended by setting IRQF_COND_SUSPEND.
