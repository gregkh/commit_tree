rcu: Don't bother affinitying rcub kthreads away from offline CPUs

When rcu_boost_kthread_setaffinity() sees that all CPUs for a given
rcu_node structure are now offline, it affinities the corresponding
RCU-boost ("rcub") kthread away from those CPUs.  This is pointless
because the kthread cannot run on those offline CPUs in any case.
This commit therefore removes this unneeded code.
