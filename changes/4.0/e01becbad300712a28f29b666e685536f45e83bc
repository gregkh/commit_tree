IIO: si7020: Allocate correct amount of memory in devm_iio_device_alloc

Since only a pointer to struct i2c_client is stored in a private area
of IIO device created by the driver there's no need to allocate
sizeof(struct i2c_client) worth of storage.

Pushed to stable as this is linked to the revert patch previously.
Without this followup the original patch looks sensible.
