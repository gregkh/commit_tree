[media] coda: adjust sequence offset after unexpected decoded frame

If userspace doesn't properly separate the bitstream input into
individual frames (which may happen for example on slightly
corrupted streams) the CODA hardware may decode more frames
than we expect. We already log an error in this case, but it's
also necessary to adjust the sequence offset. Otherwise we
spam the log with a sequence number mismatch on every frame
frame after the unexpected one.
