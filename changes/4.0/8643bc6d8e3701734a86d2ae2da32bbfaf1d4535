drm/tegra: dc: Fix bad irqsave/restore in tegra_dc_finish_page_flip()

We can't save two values to the IRQ flags at the same time so the IRQs
are not enabled at the end.  This kind of bug is easy to miss in testing
if the function is normally called with IRQs disabled so we wouldn't
enable IRQs anyway.
