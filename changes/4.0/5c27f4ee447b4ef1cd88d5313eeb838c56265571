f2fs: merge two uchar variable in struct node_info to reduce memory cost

This patch moves one member of struct nat_entry: _flag_ to struct node_info,
so _version_ in struct node_info and _flag_ which are unsigned char type will
merge to one 32-bit space in register/memory. So the size of nat_entry will be
reduced from 28 bytes to 24 bytes (for 64-bit machine, reduce its size from 40
bytes to 32 bytes) and then slab memory using by f2fs will be reduced.

changes from v2:
 o update description of memory usage gain for 64-bit machine suggested by
   Changman Lee.
changes from v1:
 o introduce inline copy_node_info() to copy valid data from node info suggested
   by Jaegeuk Kim, it can avoid bug.
