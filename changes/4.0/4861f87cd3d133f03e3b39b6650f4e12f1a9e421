perf tools: Make sparc64 arch point to sparc

The recent build changes cause perf to not compile for sparc64 since the
arch/sparc64/Build file does not exist:

/home/dahern/kernels/linux.git/tools/build/Makefile.build:40: arch/sparc64/Build: No such file or directory

Fix by converting the sparc64 RAW_ARCH to sparc ARCH -- similar to what
is done for x86_64.
