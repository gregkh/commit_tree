clk: remove clk-private.h

Private clock framework data structures should be private, surprisingly.

Now that all platforms and drivers have been updated to remove static
initializations of struct clk and struct clk_core objects and all
references to clk-private.h have been removed we can move the
definitions of these structures into drivers/clk/clk.c and delete the
header.

Additionally the ugly DEFINE_CLK macros have been removed. Those were
used for static definitions of struct clk objects. That practice is no
longer allowed.

Finally __clk_init is staticized as it is no longer declared in any
header.
