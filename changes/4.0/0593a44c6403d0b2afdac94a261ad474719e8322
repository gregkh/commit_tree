MIPS: kernel: unaligned: Add support for the MIPS R6

The load/store unaligned instructions have been removed in MIPS R6
so we need to re-implement the related macros using the regular
load/store instructions. Moreover, the load/store from coprocessor 2
instructions have been reallocated in Release 6 so we will handle them
in the emulator instead.
