MIPS: Emulate the new MIPS R6 B{L,G}T{Z,}{AL,}C instructions

MIPS R6 added the following four instructions which share the
BGTZ and BGTZL opcode:

BLTZALC: Compact branch-and-link if GPR rt is < to zero
BGTZALC: Compact branch-and-link if GPR rt is > to zero
BLTZL  : Compact branch if GPR rt is < to zero
BGTZL  : Compact branch if GPR rt is > to zero
BLTC   : Compact branch if GPR rs is less than GPR rt
BLTUC  : Similar to BLTC but unsigned
