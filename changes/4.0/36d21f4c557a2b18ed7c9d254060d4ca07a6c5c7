drm/i915/dsi: remove unnecessary dsi device callbacks

Remove all the trivial and/or dummy callbacks from intel dsi device
ops. Merge send_otp_cmds into panel_reset as they're called back to
back.

This will be helpful for switching to use drm_panel for the
callbacks. If we ever need the additional callbacks, we should add them
to drm_panel funcs.
