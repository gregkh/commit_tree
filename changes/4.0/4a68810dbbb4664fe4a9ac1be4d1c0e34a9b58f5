vfio: Tie IOMMU group reference to vfio group

Move the iommu_group reference from the device to the vfio_group.
This ensures that the iommu_group persists as long as the vfio_group
remains.  This can be important if all of the device from an
iommu_group are removed, but we still have an outstanding vfio_group
reference; we can still walk the empty list of devices.
