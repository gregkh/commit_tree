xen/events: avoid NULL pointer dereference in dom0 on large machines

Using the pvops kernel a NULL pointer dereference was detected on a
large machine (144 processors) when booting as dom0 in
evtchn_fifo_unmask() during assignment of a pirq.

The event channel in question was the first to need a new entry in
event_array[] in events_fifo.c. Unfortunately xen_irq_info_pirq_setup()
is called with evtchn being 0 for a new pirq and the real event channel
number is assigned to the pirq only during __startup_pirq().

It is mandatory to call xen_evtchn_port_setup() after assigning the
event channel number to the pirq to make sure all memory needed for the
event channel is allocated.
