usb: gadget: f_fs: refactor and document __ffs_ep0_read_events better

Instead of using variable length array, use a static length equal to
the size of the ffs->ev.types array.  This gets rid of a sparse warning:

	drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_fs.c:401:44: warning:
	Variable length array is used.

and makes it more explicit that the array has a very tight upper size
limit.  Also add some more documentation about the ev.types array and
how its size is limited and affects the rest of the code.
