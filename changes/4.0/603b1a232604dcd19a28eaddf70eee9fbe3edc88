rtc: at91sam9: rework wakeup and interrupt handling

The IRQ line used by the RTC device is usually shared with the system timer
(PIT) on at91 platforms.

Since timers are registering their handlers with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, we should
expect being called in suspended state, and properly wake the system up
when this is the case.

Set IRQF_COND_SUSPEND flag when registering the IRQ handler to inform
irq core that it can safely be called while the system is suspended.
