netfilter: conntrack: Flush connections with a given mark

This patch adds support for selective flushing of conntrack mappings.
By adding CTA_MARK and CTA_MARK_MASK to a delete-message, the mark (and
mask) is checked before a connection is deleted while flushing.

Configuring the flush is moved out of ctnetlink_del_conntrack(), and
instead of calling nf_conntrack_flush_report(), we always call
nf_ct_iterate_cleanup().  This enables us to only make one call from the
new ctnetlink_flush_conntrack() and makes it easy to add more filter
parameters.

Filtering is done in the ctnetlink_filter_match()-function, which is
also called from ctnetlink_dump_table(). ctnetlink_dump_filter has been
renamed ctnetlink_filter, to indicated that it is no longer only used
when dumping conntrack entries.

Moreover, reject mark filters with -EOPNOTSUPP if no ct mark support is
available.
