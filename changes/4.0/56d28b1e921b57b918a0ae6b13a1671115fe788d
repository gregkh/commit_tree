netlink: Use rhashtable walk iterator

This patch gets rid of the manual rhashtable walk in netlink
which touches rhashtable internals that should not be exposed.
It does so by using the rhashtable iterator primitives.

In fact the existing code was very buggy.  Some sockets weren't
shown at all while others were shown more than once.
