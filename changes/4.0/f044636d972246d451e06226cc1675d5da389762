NFS: Add attribute update barriers to nfs_setattr_update_inode()

Ensure that other operations which raced with our setattr RPC call
cannot revert the file attribute changes that were made on the server.
To do so, we artificially bump the attribute generation counter on
the inode so that all calls to nfs_fattr_init() that precede ours
will be dropped.

The motivation for the patch came from Chuck Lever's reports of readaheads
racing with truncate operations and causing the file size to be reverted.
