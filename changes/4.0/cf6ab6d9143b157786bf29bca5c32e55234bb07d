tracing: Add ref count to tracer for when they are being read by pipe

When one of the trace pipe files are being read (by either the trace_pipe
or trace_pipe_raw), do not allow the current_trace to change. By adding
a ref count that is incremented when the pipe files are opened, will
prevent the current_trace from being changed.

This will allow for the removal of the global trace_types_lock from
reading the pipe buffers (which is currently a bottle neck).
