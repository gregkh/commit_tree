HID: rmi: Support non rmi devices by passing events to hid-input

Allowing hid-rmi to bind to non rmi devices allows us to support composite USB
devices which contain several HID devices one of which is a HID touchpad.
Since all of the devices have the same VID and PID we can add the device
to the hid_have_special_driver list and have hid-rmi handle all of the devices.
Then hid-rmi's probe can look for the rmi specific HID report IDs and decide if
it should handle the device as a rmi device or simply report that the events
needs additional processing.
