iio: core: Introduce ENERGY channel type

Human activity sensors report the energy burnt by the user.
One of this devices is Freescale's MMA9553L
(http://www.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/ref_manual/MMA9553LSWRM.pdf)
that computes the number of calories based on weight and step rate.

Introduce a new channel type ENERGY to export these values.
