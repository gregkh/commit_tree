powerpc/perf/{hv-gpci, hv-common}: generate requests with counters annotated

This adds (in req-gen/) a framework for defining gpci counter requests.
It uses macro magic similar to ftrace.

Also convert the existing hv-gpci request structures and enum values to
use the new framework (and adjust old users of the structs and enum
values to cope with changes in naming).

In exchange for this macro disaster, we get autogenerated event listing
for GPCI in sysfs, build time field offset checking, and zero
duplication of information about GPCI requests.
