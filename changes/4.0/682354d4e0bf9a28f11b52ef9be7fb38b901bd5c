rtc: ds1685: fix ds1685_rtc_alarm_irq_enable build error

The newly added ds1685 driver causes a build error when enabled without
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_DEV:

  drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1685.c:919:22: error: 'ds1685_rtc_alarm_irq_enable' undeclared here (not in a function)
    .alarm_irq_enable = ds1685_rtc_alarm_irq_enable,

Apparently the driver was incorrectly changed to reflect the interface
change from 16380c153a69c ("RTC: Convert rtc drivers to use the
alarm_irq_enable method"), which removed the respective #ifdef from all
other rtc drivers.

This does the same change that was merged for the other drivers before and
removes the #ifdef, allowing the interrupts to be enabled through the
in-kernel rtc interface independent of the existence of /dev/rtc.
