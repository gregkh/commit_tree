arm/arm64: KVM: rework MPIDR assignment and add accessors

The virtual MPIDR registers (containing topology information) for the
guest are currently mapped linearily to the vcpu_id. Improve this
mapping for arm64 by using three levels to not artificially limit the
number of vCPUs.
To help this, change and rename the kvm_vcpu_get_mpidr() function to
mask off the non-affinity bits in the MPIDR register.
Also add an accessor to later allow easier access to a vCPU with a
given MPIDR. Use this new accessor in the PSCI emulation.
