ARM: 8271/1: omap1: Migrate debug_ll macros to use 8250.S

The omap1's debug-macro.S is similar to the generic 8250 code. Compared to
the 8520 code the omap1 macro automatically determines what UART to use
based on breadcrumbs left by the bootloader and automatically copes with
the eccentric register layout on OMAP7XX.

This patch drops both these features and relies instead on the generic
8250 macros:

1. Dropping support for the bootloader breadcrumbs is identical to the
   way the migration was handled for OMAP2 (see 808b7e07464d...).

2. Support for OMAP7XX still exists but it must be configured by hand
   (DEBUG_OMAP7XXUART1/2/3) rather than handled at runtime.
