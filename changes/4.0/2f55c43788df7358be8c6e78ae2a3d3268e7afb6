tipc: remove unnecessary wrapper functions of kernel timer APIs

Not only some wrapper function like k_term_timer() is empty, but also
some others including k_start_timer() and k_cancel_timer() don't return
back any value to its caller, what's more, there is no any component
in the kernel world to do such thing. Therefore, these timer interfaces
defined in tipc module should be purged.
