md: protect ->pers changes with mddev->lock

->pers is already protected by ->reconfig_mutex, and
cannot possibly change when there are threads running or
outstanding IO.

However there are some places where we access ->pers
not in a thread or IO context, and where ->reconfig_mutex
is unnecessarily heavy-weight:  level_show and md_seq_show().

So protect all changes, and those accesses, with ->lock.
This is a step toward taking those accesses out from under
reconfig_mutex.

[Fixed missing "mddev->pers" -> "pers" conversion, thanks to
