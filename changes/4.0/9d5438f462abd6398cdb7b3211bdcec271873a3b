pstore: Add pmsg - user-space accessible pstore object

A secured user-space accessible pstore object. Writes
to /dev/pmsg0 are appended to the buffer, on reboot
the persistent contents are available in
/sys/fs/pstore/pmsg-ramoops-[ID].

One possible use is syslogd, or other daemon, can
write messages, then on reboot provides a means to
triage user-space activities leading up to a panic
as a companion to the pstore dmesg or console logs.
