f2fs: split UMOUNT and FASTBOOT flags

This patch adds FASTBOOT flag into checkpoint as follows.

 - CP_UMOUNT_FLAG is set when system is umounted.
 - CP_FASTBOOT_FLAG is set when intermediate checkpoint having node summaries
   was done.

So, if you get CP_UMOUNT_FLAG from checkpoint, the system was umounted cleanly.
Instead, if there was sudden-power-off, you can get CP_FASTBOOT_FLAG or nothing.
