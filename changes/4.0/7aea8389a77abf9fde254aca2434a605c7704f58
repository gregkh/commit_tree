leds: Add LED Flash class extension to the LED subsystem

Some LED devices support two operation modes - torch and flash.
This patch provides support for flash LED devices in the LED subsystem
by introducing new sysfs attributes and kernel internal interface.
The attributes being introduced are: flash_brightness, flash_strobe,
flash_timeout, max_flash_timeout, max_flash_brightness, flash_fault,
flash_sync_strobe and available_sync_leds. All the flash related
features are placed in a separate module.

The modifications aim to be compatible with V4L2 framework requirements
related to the flash devices management. The design assumes that V4L2
sub-device can take of the LED class device control and communicate
with it through the kernel internal interface. When V4L2 Flash sub-device
file is opened, the LED class device sysfs interface is made
unavailable.
