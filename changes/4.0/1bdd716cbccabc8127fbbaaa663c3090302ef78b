cfg80211: return private regdom for self-managed devices

If a device has self-managed regulatory, insist on returning the wiphy
specific regdomain if a wiphy-idx is specified. The global regdomain is
meaningless for such devices.

Also add an attribute for self-managed devices, so usermode can
distinguish them as such.
