powerpc/powernv: Fixes for hypervisor doorbell handling

Since we can now use hypervisor doorbells for host IPIs, this makes
sure we clear the host IPI flag when taking a doorbell interrupt, and
clears any pending doorbell IPI in pnv_smp_cpu_kill_self() (as we
already do for IPIs sent via the XICS interrupt controller).  Otherwise
if there did happen to be a leftover pending doorbell interrupt for
an offline CPU thread for any reason, it would prevent that thread from
going into a power-saving mode; it would instead keep waking up because
of the interrupt.
