usb: core: hub: modify hub reset logic in hub driver

Currently if port power is turned off by user on hub port
using USBDEVFS then port power is turned back ON
by hub driver.
This commit modifies hub reset logic in hub_port_connect() to prevent
hub driver from turning back the port power ON if port is not owned
by kernel.
