ipv6: Don't reduce hop limit for an interface

A local route may have a lower hop_limit set than global routes do.

RFC 3756, Section 4.2.7, "Parameter Spoofing"

>   1.  The attacker includes a Current Hop Limit of one or another small
>       number which the attacker knows will cause legitimate packets to
>       be dropped before they reach their destination.

>   As an example, one possible approach to mitigate this threat is to
>   ignore very small hop limits.  The nodes could implement a
>   configurable minimum hop limit, and ignore attempts to set it below
>   said limit.
