fib_trie: Add functions should_inflate and should_halve

This change pulls the logic for if we should inflate/halve the nodes out
into separate functions.  It also addresses what I believe is a bug where 1
full node is all that is needed to keep a node from ever being halved.

Simple script to reproduce the issue:
	modprobe dummy;	ifconfig dummy0 up
	for i in `seq 0 255`; do ifconfig dummy0:$i 10.0.${i}.1/24 up; done
	ifconfig dummy0:256 10.0.255.33/16 up
	for i in `seq 0 254`; do ifconfig dummy0:$i down; done
