hwmon: (ina2xx) implement update_interval attribute for ina226

This attribute allows to configure the update interval of ina226. Although
the bus and shunt voltage conversion times remain hardcoded to 1.1 ms, we can
now modify said interval by changing the averaging rate.

While we're at it - add an additional variable to ina2xx_data, which holds
the current configuration settings - this way we'll be able to restore the
configuration in case of an unexpected chip reset.
