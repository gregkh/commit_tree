dm space map disk: fix sm_disk_count_is_more_than_one()

dm_tm_shadow_block() is the only caller of
dm_sm_count_is_more_than_one() which only ever operates on a metadata
space-map.  So in practice, sm_disk_count_is_more_than_one() isn't
actually used (which explains why this bug never amounted to anything).

But fix sm_disk_count_is_more_than_one() to properly set *result and
return 0.
