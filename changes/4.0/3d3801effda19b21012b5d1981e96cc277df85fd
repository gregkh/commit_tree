clk: introduce clk_is_match

Some drivers compare struct clk pointers as a means of knowing
if the two pointers reference the same clock hardware. This behavior is
dubious (drivers must not dereference struct clk), but did not cause any
regressions until the per-user struct clk patch was merged. Now the test
for matching clk's will always fail with per-user struct clk's.

clk_is_match is introduced to fix the regression and prevent drivers
from comparing the pointers manually.
