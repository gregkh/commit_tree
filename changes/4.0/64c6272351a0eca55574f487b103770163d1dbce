fib_trie: Various clean-ups for handling slen

While doing further work on the fib_trie I noted a few items.

First I was using calls that were far more complicated than they needed to
be for determining when to push/pull the suffix length.  I have updated the
code to reflect the simplier logic.

The second issue is that I realised we weren't necessarily handling the
case of a leaf_info struct surviving a flush.  I have updated the logic so
that now we will call pull_suffix in the event of having a leaf info value
left in the leaf after flushing it.
