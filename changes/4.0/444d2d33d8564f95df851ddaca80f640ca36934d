ARM: make of_device_ids const

of_device_ids (i.e. compatible strings and the respective data) are not
supposed to change at runtime. All functions working with of_device_ids
provided by <linux/of.h> work with const of_device_ids. So mark the
non-const structs in arch/arm as const, too.

While at it also add some __initconst annotations.
