powerpc: Rename _TIF_SYSCALL_T_OR_A to _TIF_SYSCALL_DOTRACE

Once upon a time, at least 9 years ago (< 2.6.12), _TIF_SYSCALL_T_OR_A
meant "TRACE or AUDIT". But these days it means TRACE or AUDIT or
SECCOMP or TRACEPOINT or NOHZ.

All of those are implemented via syscall_dotrace() so rename the flag to
that to try and clarify things.
