serial: fsl_lpuart: move DMA channel request to probe

Move the DMA channel request to probe to avoid requesting the DMA
channel on each opening of the ttyLPx device. This also fixes a
potential issue that TX channel is not freed when only RX channel
allocation fails. The DMA channels are now handled independently,
so one could use UART with DMA only in TX direction for instance.
