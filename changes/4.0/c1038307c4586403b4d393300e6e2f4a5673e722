vme: fix misspelling of current function in string

Replace a misspelled function name by %s and then __func__.

This is the get function, not the set function, as was indicated by the
string.

This was done using Coccinelle, including the use of Levenshtein distance,
as proposed by Rasmus Villemoes.
