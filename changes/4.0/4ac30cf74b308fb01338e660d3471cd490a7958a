perf tools: Do not use __perf_session__process_events() directly

It's only used for perf record to process build-id because its file size
it's not fixed at this time due to remaining header features.

However data offset and size is available so that we can use the
perf_session__process_events() once we set the file size as the current
offset like for now.
