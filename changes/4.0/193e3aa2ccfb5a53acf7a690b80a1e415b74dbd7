nfs41: introduce NFS_LAYOUT_RETURN_BEFORE_CLOSE

When it is set, generic pnfs would try to send layoutreturn right
before last close/delegation_return regard less NFS_LAYOUT_ROC is
set or not. LD can then make sure layoutreturn is always sent
rather than being omitted.

The difference against NFS_LAYOUT_RETURN is that
NFS_LAYOUT_RETURN_BEFORE_CLOSE does not block usage of the layout so
LD can set it and expect generic layer to try pnfs path at the
same time.
