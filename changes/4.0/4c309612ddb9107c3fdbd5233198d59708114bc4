staging/lustre/llite: Solve a race to access lli_has_smd in read case

In vvp_io_read_lock(), it used to decide if to add read lock by
checking lli_has_smd. Accessing lli_has_smd is racy when an empty
file is turned into raid0, therefore, it may result in read requests
are issued without corresponding lock.
