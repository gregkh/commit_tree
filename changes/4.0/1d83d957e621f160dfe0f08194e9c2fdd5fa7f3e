drm/i915: Don't pretend SDVO hotplug works on 915

915 doens't support hotplug at all, so we shouldn't try to pretend
otherwise in the SDVO code.

Note: i915 does have hotplug support in hw, we simply never enabled it
in i915.ko: There's only one hpd bit for all outputs, so not worth the
bother to add this special case for this rather old platform.
