IB/iser: Fix memory regions possible leak

When teardown process starts during live IO, we need to keep the
memory regions pool (frmr/fmr) until all in-flight tasks are properly
released, since each task may return a memory region to the pool. In
order to do this, we pass a destroy flag to iser_free_ib_conn_res to
indicate we can destroy the device and the memory regions
pool. iser_conn_release will pass it as true and also DEVICE_REMOVAL
event (we need to let the device to properly remove).

Also, Since we conditionally call iser_free_rx_descriptors,
remove the extra check on iser_conn->rx_descs.
