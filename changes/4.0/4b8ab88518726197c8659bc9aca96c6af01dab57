ALSA: es1688: Remove almost always NULL parameter

snd_es1688_pcm() takes a pointer to a pointer of a PCM where if this
parameter is provided the newly allocated PCM is stored. This PCM is also
available from the pcm field of the snd_es1688 struct that got passed to the
same function. This patch updates all callers which passed a pointer to use
that field instead and then removes the parameter from the function. This
makes the code a bit shorter and cleaner.
