tracing: Remove unneeded includes of debugfs.h and fs.h

The creation of tracing files and directories is for the most part
encapsulated in helper functions in trace.c. Other files do not need to
include debugfs.h or fs.h, as they may have needed to in the past.

Remove them from the files that do not need them.
