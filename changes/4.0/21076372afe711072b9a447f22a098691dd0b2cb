drm/i915: Remove FIXME_lrc_ctx backpointer

The first pass implementation of execlists required a backpointer to the context to be held
in the intel_ringbuffer. However the context pointer is available higher in the call stack.
Remove the backpointer from the ring buffer structure and instead pass it down through the
call stack.

v2: Integrate this changeset with the removal of duplicate request/execlist queue item members.
v3: Rebase
v4: Rebase. Remove passing of context when the request is passed.
