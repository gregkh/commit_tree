tty/serial: of_serial: add support for PXA/MMP uarts

Add mrvl,pxa-uart and mrvl,mmp-uart compatible strings for the of_serial
driver. These are 8250 variants which have a port type of PORT_XSCALE.

There is also the serial driver pxa.c with these compatible strings
already. However, it can be replaced with the common 8250 driver. It has
some issues like it cannot coexist with the 8250 driver due to tty name
collision. That also means adding these compatible strings here should
not case a problem.
