powerpc/kvm: Create proper names for the kvm_host_state PMU fields

We have two arrays in kvm_host_state that contain register values for
the PMU. Currently we only create an asm-offsets symbol for the base of
the arrays, and do the array offset in the assembly code.

Creating an asm-offsets symbol for each field individually makes the
code much nicer to read, particularly for the MMCRx/SIxR/SDAR fields, and
might have helped us notice the recent double restore bug we had in this
code.
