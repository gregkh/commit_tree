cxgb4: Fix PCI-E Memory window interface for big-endian systems

When doing reads and writes to adapter memory via the PCI-E Memory Window
interface, data gets swizzled on 4-byte boundaries on Big-Endian systems
because we need to account for the register read/write interface which
incorporates a swizzle onto the Little-Endian PCI-E Bus.
