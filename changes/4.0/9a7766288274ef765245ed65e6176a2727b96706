netfilter: Use rhashtable walk iterator

This patch gets rid of the manual rhashtable walk in nft_hash
which touches rhashtable internals that should not be exposed.
It does so by using the rhashtable iterator primitives.

Note that I'm leaving nft_hash_destroy alone since it's only
invoked on shutdown and it shouldn't be affected by changes
to rhashtable internals (or at least not what I'm planning to
change).
