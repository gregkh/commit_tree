microblaze: intc: Reformat output

A message was using pr_info level output for a message including "ERROR"
which is not really a fatal error.
Remove the 'ERROR' from that message, use pr_warn loglevel and add the
function name to the output to give users a chance to find the culprit
in case the warning triggers.
