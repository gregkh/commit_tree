kernel: make READ_ONCE() valid on const arguments

The use of READ_ONCE() causes lots of warnings witht he pending paravirt
spinlock fixes, because those ends up having passing a member to a
'const' structure to READ_ONCE().

There should certainly be nothing wrong with using READ_ONCE() with a
const source, but the helper function __read_once_size() would cause
warnings because it would drop the 'const' qualifier, but also because
the destination would be marked 'const' too due to the use of 'typeof'.

Use a union of types in READ_ONCE() to avoid this issue.

Also make sure to use parenthesis around the macro arguments to avoid
possible operator precedence issues.
