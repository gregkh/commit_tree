HID: wacom: process invalid Cintiq and Intuos data in wacom_intuos_inout()

Users may use unsupported tools on Cintiq or Intuos. When invalid tools or data
are detected, they should be ignored. That is, no event from those tools should
be reported.

Consolidating that code in wacom_intuos_inout simplifies the logic and make it
easier for future code change.
