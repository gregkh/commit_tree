KVM: s390: a VCPU may only stop when no interrupts are left pending

As a SIGP STOP is an interrupt with the least priority, it may only result
in stop of the vcpu when no other interrupts are left pending.

To detect whether a non-stop irq is pending, we need a way to mask out
stop irqs from the general kvm_cpu_has_interrupt() function. For this
reason, the existing function (with an outdated name) is replaced by
kvm_s390_vcpu_has_irq() which allows to mask out pending stop irqs.
