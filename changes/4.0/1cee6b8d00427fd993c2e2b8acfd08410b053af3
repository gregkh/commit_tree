USB: host: ohci-at91: Fix wake-up support

This device needs to be continuously clocked to provide wake up support,
previously, if STANDBY target were chosen the device were
enable_irq_wake()-prepared and clock still active and if MEM target were
chosen the device were also enable_irq_wake()-prepared but not clocked
anymore, which is wrong.

Now, if STANDBY target is chosen the device is still clocked with wake
up support enabled, which were the previous default and if MEM target is
chosen the device is declocked with wake up support disabled.
