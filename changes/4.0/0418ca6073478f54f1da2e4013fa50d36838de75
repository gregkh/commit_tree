[media] em28xx: ensure "closing" messages terminate with a newline

The lockdep splat addressed in a previous commit revealed that at
least one message in em28xx-input.c was missing a new line:

em28178 #0: Closing input extensionINFO: trying to register non-static key.

Further inspection shows several other messages also miss a new line.
These will be fixed in a subsequent patch.
