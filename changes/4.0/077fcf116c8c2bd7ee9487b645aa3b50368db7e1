mm/thp: allocate transparent hugepages on local node

This make sure that we try to allocate hugepages from local node if
allowed by mempolicy.  If we can't, we fallback to small page allocation
based on mempolicy.  This is based on the observation that allocating
pages on local node is more beneficial than allocating hugepages on remote
node.

With this patch applied we may find transparent huge page allocation
failures if the current node doesn't have enough freee hugepages.  Before
this patch such failures result in us retrying the allocation on other
nodes in the numa node mask.
