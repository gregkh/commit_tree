clk: Add rate constraints to clocks

Adds a way for clock consumers to set maximum and minimum rates. This
can be used for thermal drivers to set minimum rates, or by misc.
drivers to set maximum rates to assure a minimum performance level.

Changes the signature of the determine_rate callback by adding the
parameters min_rate and max_rate.
