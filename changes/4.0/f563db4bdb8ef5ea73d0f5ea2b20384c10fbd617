KVM: SVM: fix interrupt injection (apic->isr_count always 0)

In commit b4eef9b36db4, we started to use hwapic_isr_update() != NULL
instead of kvm_apic_vid_enabled(vcpu->kvm).  This didn't work because
SVM had it defined and "apicv" path in apic_{set,clear}_isr() does not
change apic->isr_count, because it should always be 1.  The initial
value of apic->isr_count was based on kvm_apic_vid_enabled(vcpu->kvm),
which is always 0 for SVM, so KVM could have injected interrupts when it
shouldn't.

Fix it by implicitly setting SVM's hwapic_isr_update to NULL and make the
initial isr_count depend on hwapic_isr_update() for good measure.

Fixes: b4eef9b36db4 ("kvm: x86: vmx: NULL out hwapic_isr_update() in case of !enable_apicv")
