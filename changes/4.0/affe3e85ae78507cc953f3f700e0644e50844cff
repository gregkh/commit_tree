timekeeping: Pass readout base to update_fast_timekeeper()

Modify update_fast_timekeeper() to take a struct tk_read_base
pointer as its argument (instead of a struct timekeeper pointer)
and update its kerneldoc comment to reflect that.

That will allow a struct tk_read_base that is not part of a
struct timekeeper to be passed to it in the next patch.
