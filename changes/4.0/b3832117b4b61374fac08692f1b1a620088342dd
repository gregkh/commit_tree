fib_trie: Use index & (~0ul << n->bits) instead of index >> n->bits

In doing performance testing and analysis of the changes I recently found
that by shifting the index I had created an unnecessary dependency.

I have updated the code so that we instead shift a mask by bits and then
just test against that as that should save us about 2 CPU cycles since we
can generate the mask while the key and pos are being processed.
