ARM: dts: Configure regulators for suspend on exynos Peach boards

The regulator core now has support to choose if a regulator
has to be enabled or disabled during system suspend and also
supports changing the regulator operating mode during runtime
and when the system enters into sleep mode.

To lower power during suspend, configure the regulators state
using the same configuration found in the ChromeOS 3.8 kernel
