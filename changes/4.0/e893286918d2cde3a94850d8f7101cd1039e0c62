x86/vdso: Fix the build on GCC5

On gcc5 the kernel does not link:

  ld: .eh_frame_hdr table[4] FDE at 0000000000000648 overlaps table[5] FDE at 0000000000000670.

Because prior GCC versions always emitted NOPs on ALIGN directives, but
gcc5 started omitting them.

.LSTARTFDEDLSI1 says:

        /* HACK: The dwarf2 unwind routines will subtract 1 from the
           return address to get an address in the middle of the
           presumed call instruction.  Since we didn't get here via
           a call, we need to include the nop before the real start
           to make up for it.  */
        .long .LSTART_sigreturn-1-.     /* PC-relative start address */

But commit 69d0627a7f6e ("x86 vDSO: reorder vdso32 code") from 2.6.25
replaced .org __kernel_vsyscall+32,0x90 by ALIGN right before
__kernel_sigreturn.

Of course, ALIGN need not generate any NOP in there. Esp. gcc5 collapses
vclock_gettime.o and int80.o together with no generated NOPs as "ALIGN".

So fix this by adding to that point at least a single NOP and make the
function ALIGN possibly with more NOPs then.

Kudos for reporting and diagnosing should go to Richard.
