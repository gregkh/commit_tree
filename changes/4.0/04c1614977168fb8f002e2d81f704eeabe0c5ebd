parisc: hpux - Drop support for HP-UX binaries

This patch series drops the support for 32bit HP-UX binaries.

The HP-UX compat layer has always been incomplete and it's unlikely that
someone will ever implement it.

Furthermore those two commits which enhance the compatibility of Linux on parisc
to other architectures:
 f5a408d: parisc: Make EWOULDBLOCK be equal to EAGAIN on parisc
 1f25df2: parisc: Reduce SIGRTMIN from 37 to 32 to behave like other Linux architectures
basically make it impossible to implement the HP-UX support correctly.
