KVM: Remove unused config symbol

The dirty patch logging series introduced both
HAVE_KVM_ARCH_DIRTY_LOG_PROTECT and KVM_GENERIC_DIRTYLOG_READ_PROTECT
config symbols, but only KVM_GENERIC_DIRTYLOG_READ_PROTECT is used.
Just remove the unused one.

(The config symbol was renamed during the development of the patch
series and the old name just creeped in by accident.()
