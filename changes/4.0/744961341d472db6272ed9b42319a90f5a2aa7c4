kvm: avoid page allocation failure in kvm_set_memory_region()

KVM guest can fail to startup with following trace on host:

qemu-system-x86: page allocation failure: order:4, mode:0x40d0
Call Trace:

Failure happens when attempting to allocate pages for
'struct kvm_memslots', however it doesn't have to be
present in physically contiguous (kmalloc-ed) address
space, change allocation to kvm_kvzalloc() so that
it will be vmalloc-ed when its size is more then a page.
