mmc: pwrseq_simple: Add optional reference clock support

Some WLAN chips attached to a SDIO interface, need a reference clock.

Since this is very common, extend the prseq_simple driver to support
an optional clock that is enabled prior the card power up procedure.

Note: the external clock is optional. Thus an error is not returned
if the clock is not found.
