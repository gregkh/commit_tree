lib/string_helpers.c:string_get_size(): use 32 bit arithmetic when possible

The remainder from do_div is always a u32, and after size has been reduced
to be below 1000 (or 1024), it certainly fits in u32.  So both remainder
and sf_cap can be made u32s, the format specifiers can be simplified (%lld
wasn't the right thing to use for _unsigned_ long long anyway), and we can
replace a do_div with an ordinary 32/32 bit division.
