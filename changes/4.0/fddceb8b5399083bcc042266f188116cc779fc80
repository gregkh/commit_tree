tty: 8250: Add 64byte UART support for FSL platforms

Some of FSL SoCs like T1040 has new version of UART controller which
can support 64byte FiFo.
To enable 64 byte support, following needs to be done:
-FCR[EN64] needs to be programmed to 1 to enable it.
-Also, when FCR[EN64]==1, RTL bits to be used as below
to define various Receive Trigger Levels:
        -FCR[RTL] = 00  1 byte
        -FCR[RTL] = 01  16 bytes
        -FCR[RTL] = 10  32 bytes
        -FCR[RTL] = 11  56 bytes
-tx_loadsz is set to 63-bytes instead of 64-bytes to implement
 workaround of errata A-008006 which states that tx_loadsz should
 be configured less than Maximum supported fifo bytes
