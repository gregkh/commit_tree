iommu/msm: Mark driver BROKEN

The MSM IOMMU driver unconditionally calls bus_set_iommu(), which is a
very stupid thing to do on multi-platform kernels. While marking the
driver BROKEN may seem a little extreme, there is no other way to make
the driver skip initialization. One of the problems is that it doesn't
have devicetree binding documentation and the driver doesn't contain a
struct of_device_id table either, so no way to check that it is indeed
valid to set up the IOMMU operations for this driver.

This fixes a problem on Tegra20 where the DRM driver will try to use the
obviously non-existent MSM IOMMU.

Marking the driver BROKEN shouldn't do any harm, since there aren't any
users currently. There is no struct of_device_id table, so the device
can't be instantiated from device tree, and I couldn't find any code
that would instantiate a matching platform_device either, so the driver
is effectively unused.
