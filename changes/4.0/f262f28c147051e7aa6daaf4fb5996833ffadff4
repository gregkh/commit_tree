PM / devfreq: event: Add devfreq_event class

This patch adds a new class in devfreq, devfreq_event, which provides
raw data (e.g., memory bus utilization, GPU utilization) for devfreq
governors.

- devfreq_event device : Provides raw data for a governor of a devfreq device
- devfreq device       : Monitors device state and changes frequency/voltage
			of the device using the raw data from its
			devfreq_event device.

A devfreq device dertermines performance states (normally the frequency
and the voltage vlues) based on the results its designtated devfreq governor:
e.g., ondemand, performance, powersave.

In order to give such results required by a devfreq device, the devfreq
governor requires data that indicates the performance requirement given
to the devfreq device. The conventional (previous) implementatino of
devfreq subsystem requires a devfreq device driver to implement its own
mechanism to acquire performance requirement for its governor. However,
there had been issues with such requirements:

1. Although performance requirement of such devices is usually acquired
 from common devices (PMU/PPMU), we do not have any abstract structure to
 represent them properly.
2. Such performance requirement devices (PMU/PPMU) are actual hardware
 pieces that may be represented by Device Tree directly while devfreq device
 itself is a virtual entity that are not considered to be represented by
 Device Tree according to Device Tree folks.

In order to address such issues, a devferq_event device (represented by
this patch) provides a template for device drivers representing
performance monitoring unit, which gives the basic or raw data for
preformance requirement, which in turn, is required by devfreq governors.

The following description explains the feature of two kind of devfreq class:
- devfreq class (existing)
 : devfreq consumer device use raw data from devfreq_event device for
   determining proper current system state and change voltage/frequency
   dynamically using various governors.

- devfreq_event class (new)
 : Provide measured raw data to devfreq device for governor
