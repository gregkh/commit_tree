ALSA: usb-audio: don't try to get Benchmark DAC1 sample rate

Adding this quirk allows us to avoid the noisy
"cannot get freq at ep 0x1" message in dmesg output every time
playback starts.

This ought to affect other Benchmark DAC1 variations using the same
"Microchip Technology, Inc." chip as well, but I have only tested
with the "Pre" variant.
