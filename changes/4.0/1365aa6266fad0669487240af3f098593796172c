drm/amdkfd: Initialize only amdkfd's assigned pipelines

This patch fixes a bug in the initialization of the pipelines. The
init_pipelines() function was called with a constant value of 0 in the
first_pipe argument. This is an error because amdkfd doesn't handle pipe 0.

The correct way is to pass the value that get_first_pipe() returns as the
argument for first_pipe.

This bug appeared in 3.19 (first version with amdkfd) and it causes around 15%
drop in CPU performance of Kaveri (A10-7850).

v2: Don't set get_first_pipe() as inline because it calls BUG_ON()
