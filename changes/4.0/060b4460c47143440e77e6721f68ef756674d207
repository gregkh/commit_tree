iwlwifi: mvm: disconnect if CSA time event fails scheduling

If this situation ever happens, the mac80211 state machine gets
confused because it never clears csa_active. There was a separate
bug that lead to this happening with a working connection, but it
isn't very robust to try to keep the connection up in this case.

When removing the time event the CSA essentially procedure stops,
so the safest thing to do is to disconnect in this case.
