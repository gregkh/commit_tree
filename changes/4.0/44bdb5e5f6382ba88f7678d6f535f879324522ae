VFS: Split DCACHE_FILE_TYPE into regular and special types

Split DCACHE_FILE_TYPE into DCACHE_REGULAR_TYPE (dentries representing regular
files) and DCACHE_SPECIAL_TYPE (representing blockdev, chardev, FIFO and
socket files).

d_is_reg() and d_is_special() are added to detect these subtypes and
d_is_file() is left as the union of the two.

This allows a number of places that use S_ISREG(dentry->d_inode->i_mode) to
use d_is_reg(dentry) instead.
