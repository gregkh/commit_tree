rtlwifi: rtl8192c-common: Convert driver to use common DM table initialization

These changes convert both rtl8192ce and rtl8192cu to use the new routine.
Some additional definitions are needed in the core, thus several of the
headers for other drivers are affected, but no other executable code is
changed.
