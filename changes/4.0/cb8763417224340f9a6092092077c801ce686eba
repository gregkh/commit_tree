sh-sci: extend PM methods

In order to make it possible to restore from hibernation not only in Linux but
also in e.g. U-Boot, we have to use sci_{suspend|remove}() for the PM {freeze|
thaw|restore}() methods.  It's handy to achieve this by using SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS()
macro, however we have to annotate sci_{suspend|remove}() with '__maybe_unused'
in order to avoid compilation warnings when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is undefined.
