hso: fix rfkill name conflicts

By using only the usb interface number for the rfkill name, we might
have a name conflicts in case two similar hso devices are connected.

In this patch, the name of the hso rfkill interface embed the value
of a counter that is incremented each time a new rfkill interface is
added.
