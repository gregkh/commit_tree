md: level_store: group all important changes into one place.

Gather all the changes that can happen atomically and might
be relevant to other code into one place.  This will
make it easier to refine the locking.

Note that this puts quite a few things between mddev_detach()
and ->free().  Enabling this was the point of some recent patches.
