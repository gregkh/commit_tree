x86/x2apic: Add proper state tracking

Having 3 different variables to track the state is just silly and
error prone. Add a proper state tracking variable which covers the
three possible states: ON/OFF/DISABLED.

We cannot use x2apic_mode for this as this would require to change all
users of x2apic_mode with explicit comparisons for a state value
instead of treating it as boolean.
