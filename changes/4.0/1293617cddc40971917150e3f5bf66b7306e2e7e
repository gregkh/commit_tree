ALSA: ak411x: Add PM helper functions

Define snd_ak4114_suspend() and snd_ak4114_resume() functions to
handle PM properly, stopping and restarting the work at PM.
Currently only ice1712/juli.c deals with the PM and ak4114, so fix the
calls there appropriately.

The same PM functions are defined in ak4113.c, too, although they
aren't currently called yet (ice1712/quartet.c may be enhanced to
support PM later).
