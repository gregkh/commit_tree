perf Documentation: Add event parameters

Event parameters are a basic way for partial events to be specified in
sysfs with per-event names given to the fields that need to be filled in
when using a particular event.

It is intended for supporting cases where the single 'cpu' parameter is
insufficient. For example, POWER 8 has events for physical
sockets/cores/cpus that are accessible from with virtual machines. To
keep using the single 'cpu' parameter we'd need to perform a mapping
between Linux's cpus and the physical machine's cpus (in this case Linux
is running under a hypervisor). This isn't possible because bindings
between our cpus and physical cpus may not be fixed, and we probably
won't have a "cpu" on each physical cpu.
