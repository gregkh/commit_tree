kdb: fix incorrect counts in KDB summary command output

The output of KDB 'summary' command should report MemTotal, MemFree
and Buffers output in kB. Current codes report in unit of pages.

A define of K(x) as
is defined in the code, but not used.

This patch would apply the define to convert the values to kB.
