net/mlx4_core: Fix GEN_EQE accessing uninitialixed mutex

We occasionally see in procedure mlx4_GEN_EQE that the driver tries
to grab an uninitialized mutex.

This can occur in only one of two ways:
1. We are trying to generate an async event on an uninitialized slave.
2. We are trying to generate an async event on an illegal slave number
   ( < 0 or > persist->num_vfs) or an inactive slave.

To deal with #1: move the mutex initialization from specific slave init
sequence in procedure mlx_master_do_cmd to mlx4_multi_func_init() (so that
the mutex is always initialized for all slaves).

To deal with #2: check in procedure mlx4_GEN_EQE that the slave number
provided is in the proper range and that the slave is active.
