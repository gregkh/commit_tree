powerpc/eeh: Fix missed PE#0 on P7IOC

PE#0 should be regarded as valid for P7IOC, while it's invalid for
PHB3. The patch adds flag EEH_VALID_PE_ZERO to differentiate those
two cases. Without the patch, we possibly see frozen PE#0 state is
cleared without EEH recovery taken on P7IOC as following kernel logs
indicate:
