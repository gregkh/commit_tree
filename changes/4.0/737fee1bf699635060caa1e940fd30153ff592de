staging: emxx_udc: Remove nbu2ss_drv_set_dp_info()

This function is an awkward helper for nbu2ss_drv_ep_init().  Most of
its logic is devoted to determining if the current endpoint is ep0,
something the caller can easily do in a single line.  And there is not
a lot going on beyond that.

Move this logic up into nbu2ss_drv_ep_init().  The result is much easier
to understand and the resulting function is still viewable within a
single screen.
