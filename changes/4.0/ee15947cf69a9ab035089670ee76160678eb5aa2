serial: 8250_pnp: Enable PNP_CONSOLE for console ports

When the kernel command line parameter, no_console_suspend, is used,
the console should continue to output console messages during and
after system suspend. For a serial console, the serial core ensures
that the device is not shutdown when no_console_suspend is specified.
However, the default operation of the pnp bus will disable and suspend
the device and no further output occurs.

When registering the 8250 port, if the serial device is a console
set the PNP_CONSOLE capability, which prevents device power-off
if consoles are not suspending.
