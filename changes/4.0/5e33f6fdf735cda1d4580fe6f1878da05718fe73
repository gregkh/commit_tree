usb: gadget: ffs: add eventfd notification about ffs events

Add eventfd which notifies userspace about ep0 events and AIO completion
events. It simplifies using of FunctionFS with event loop, because now
we need to poll on single file (instead of polling on ep0 and eventfd's
supplied to AIO layer).

FunctionFS eventfd is not triggered if another eventfd is supplied to
AIO layer (in AIO request). It can be useful, for example, when we want
to handle AIO transations for chosen endpoint in separate thread.
