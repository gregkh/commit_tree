drm/amdkfd: Add asic property to kfd_device_info

This patch adds a new property to kfd_device_info structure. That structure
holds information that is H/W specific.

The new property is called asic_family and its purpose is to distinguish
between different asic families in amdkfd operations, mainly in QCM (queue
control & management)

This patch also adds a new enum, to select different ASICs. We set the current
kfd_device_info instance as Kaveri and create a new instance which describes
the new AMD APU, codenamed 'Carrizo'.
