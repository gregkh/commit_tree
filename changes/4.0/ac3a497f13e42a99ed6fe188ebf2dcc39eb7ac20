hwrng: core - Do not register device opportunistically

Currently we only register the device when a valid RNG is added.
However the way it's done is buggy because we test whether there
is a current RNG to determine whether we need to register.  As
the current RNG may be missing due to a reinitialisation error
this can lead to a reregistration of the device.

As the device already has to handle a NULL current RNG anyway,
let's just register the device always and remove the complexity.
