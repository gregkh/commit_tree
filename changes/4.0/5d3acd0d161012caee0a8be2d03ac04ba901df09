be2net: refactor code that checks flash file compatibility

This patch re-factors the code that checks for flash file compatibility with
the chip type, for better readability, as follows:
	- be_get_ufi_type() returns the UFI type from the flash file
	- be_check_ufi_compatibility() checks if the UFI type is compatible
	  with the adapter/chip that is being flashed
