cpuidle: mvebu: Fix the CPU PM notifier usage

As stated in kernel/cpu_pm.c, "Platform is responsible for ensuring
that cpu_pm_enter is not called twice on the same CPU before
cpu_pm_exit is called.". In the current code in case of failure when
calling mvebu_v7_cpu_suspend, the function cpu_pm_exit() is never
called whereas cpu_pm_enter() was called just before.

This patch moves the cpu_pm_exit() in order to balance the
cpu_pm_enter() calls.
