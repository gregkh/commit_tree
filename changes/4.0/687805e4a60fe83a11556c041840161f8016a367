perf/x86/intel: Filter branches for PEBS event

For supporting Intel LBR branches filtering, Intel LBR sharing logic
mechanism is introduced from commit b36817e88630 ("perf/x86: Add Intel
LBR sharing logic"). It modifies __intel_shared_reg_get_constraints() to
config lbr_sel, which is finally used to set LBR_SELECT.

However, the intel_shared_regs_constraints() function is called after
intel_pebs_constraints(). The PEBS event will return immediately after
intel_pebs_constraints(). So it's impossible to filter branches for PEBS
events.

This patch moves intel_shared_regs_constraints() ahead of
intel_pebs_constraints().

We can safely do that because the intel_shared_regs_constraints() function
only returns empty constraint if its rejecting the event, otherwise it
returns NULL such that we continue calling intel_pebs_constraints() and
x86_get_event_constraint().
