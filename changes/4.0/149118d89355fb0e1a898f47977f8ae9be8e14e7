netlink: Warn on unordered or illegal nla_nest_cancel() or nlmsg_cancel()

Calling nla_nest_cancel() in a different order as the nesting was
built up can lead to negative offsets being calculated which
results in skb_trim() being called with an underflowed unsigned
int. Warn if mark < skb->data as it's definitely a bug.
