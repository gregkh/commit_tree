spi/xilinx: Support cores with no interrupt

The core can run in polling mode. In fact, the performance of the core
is similar (or even better), due to the fact most of the spi
transactions are just a couple of bytes and there is one irq per
transactions.

When an mtd device is connected via spi, reading 8MB of data produces
more than 80K interrupts (with irq disabling, context swith....)
