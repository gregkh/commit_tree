storvsc: force discovery of LUNs that may have been removed.

The host asks the guest to scan when a LUN is removed or added.
The only way a guest can identify the removed LUN is when an I/O is
attempted on a removed LUN - the SRB status code indicates that the LUN
is invalid. We currently handle this SRB status and remove the device.

Rather than waiting for an I/O to remove the device, force the discovery of
LUNs that may have been removed prior to discovering LUNs that may have
been added.
