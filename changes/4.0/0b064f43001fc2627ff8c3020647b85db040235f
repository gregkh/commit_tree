perf symbols: Support to read compressed module from build-id cache

The commit c00c48fc6e6e ("perf symbols: Preparation for compressed
kernel module support") added support for compressed kernel modules but
it only supports system path DSOs.  When a dso is read from build-id
cache, its filename doesn't end with ".gz" but has build-id.  In this
case, we should fallback to the original dso->name.
