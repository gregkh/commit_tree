serial: 8250: Use canary to restart console after suspend

When using no_console_suspend, the serial console may be powered off
anyway during system sleep. Upon resume, the port may be in its default
power-on state, but is expected to continue console i/o before the device
has received its pm callback. The resultant garbage i/o can cause all
kinds of havoc on the remote end.

Use the scratch register as a canary to discover if the console
has been powered-off. Write a non-zero value to the scratch register
at port suspend and reprogram the port before any console i/o if the
scratch register != canary before port resume.

This workaround is disabled for omap_8250 (which uses different divisor
programming).

the scratch register canary to discover port power-down.
