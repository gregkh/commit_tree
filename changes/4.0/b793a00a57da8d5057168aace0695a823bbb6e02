drm/i915: Add helper functions to aid seqno -> request transition

Added helper functions for retrieving the ring and seqno entries from a request
structure. This allows the internal workings of the request structure to be
hidden from code that is using these. It also allows for useful
workarounds/debug code to be added as or when necessary.

Note that it is intended that the majority (if not all) uses of the seqno
accessor will disappear eventually as code is updated to use the request
structure itself rather than working with seqno values.
