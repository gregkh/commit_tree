sched/rt: Avoid obvious configuration fail

Setting the root group's cpu.rt_runtime_us to 0 is a bad thing; it
would disallow the kernel creating RT tasks.

One can of course still set it to 1, which will (likely) still wreck
your kernel, but at least make it clear that setting it to 0 is not
good.

Collect both sanity checks into the one place while we're there.
