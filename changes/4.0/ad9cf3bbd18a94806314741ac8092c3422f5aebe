block: mark blk-mq devices as stackable

Commit 4ee5eaf4 ("block: add a queue flag for request stacking support")
introduced the concept of "STACKABLE" and blk-mq devices fit the
definition in that they establish q->request_fn.  So establish
QUEUE_FLAG_STACKABLE in QUEUE_FLAG_MQ_DEFAULT.

While not strictly needed (DM _could_ just check for q->mq_ops to assume
the device is request-based), request-based DM support for blk-mq devices
benefits from the ability to consistently check for QUEUE_FLAG_STACKABLE
before allowing a device to be stacked into a request-based DM table.
