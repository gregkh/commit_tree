loop: add blk-mq.h include

Looks like we pull it in through other ways on x86, but we fail
on sparc:

In file included from drivers/block/cryptoloop.c:30:0:
drivers/block/loop.h:63:24: error: field 'tag_set' has incomplete type
struct blk_mq_tag_set tag_set;

Add the include to loop.h, kill it from loop.c.
