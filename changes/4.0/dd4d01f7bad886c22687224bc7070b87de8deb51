pinctrl: pinconf-generic: Allow driver to specify DT params

Additionally to the generic DT parameters, allow drivers to provide
driver-specific DT parameters to be used with the generic parser
infrastructure.

To achieve this 'struct pinctrl_desc' is extended to pass custom pinconf
option to the core. In order to pass this kind of information, the
related data structures - 'struct pinconf_generic_dt_params',
'pin_config_item' - are moved from pinconf internals to the
pinconf-generic header.

Additionally pinconfg-generic is refactored to not only iterate over the
generic pinconf parameters but also take the parameters into account
that are provided through the driver's 'struct pinctrl_desc'.
In particular 'pinconf_generic_parse_dt_config()' and
'pinconf_generic_dump' helpers are split into two parts each. In order
to have a more generic helper that can be used to process the generic
parameters as well as the driver-specific ones.

v2:
 - fix typo
 - add missing documentation for @conf_items member in struct
 - rebase to pinctrl/devel: conflict in abx500
 - rename _pinconf_generic_dump() to pinconf_generic_dump_one()
 - removed '_' from _parse_dt_cfg()
 - removed BUG_ONs, error condition is handled in if statements
 - removed pinconf_generic_dump_group() & pinconf_generic_dump_pin
   helpers
   - fixed up corresponding call sites
   - renamed pinconf_generic_dump() to pinconf_generic_dump_pins()
   - added kernel-doc to pinconf_generic_dump_pins()
 - add kernel-doc
 - more verbose commit message
