arm64: kvm: remove ESR_EL2_* macros

Now that all users have been moved over to the common ESR_ELx_* macros,
remove the redundant ESR_EL2 macros. To maintain compatibility with the
fault handling code shared with 32-bit, the FSC_{FAULT,PERM} macros are
retained as aliases for the common ESR_ELx_FSC_{FAULT,PERM} definitions.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
