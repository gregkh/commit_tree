drm/i915: Ensure requests stick around during waits

Added reference counting of the request structure around __wait_seqno() calls.
This is a precursor to updating the wait code itself to take the request rather
than a seqno. At that point, it would be a Bad Idea for a request object to be
retired and freed while the wait code is still using it.

v3:

Note that even though the mutex lock is held during a call to i915_wait_seqno(),
it is still necessary to explicitly bump the reference count. It appears that
the shrinker can asynchronously retire items even though the mutex is locked.
