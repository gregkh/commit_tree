can: kvaser_usb: Add support for the USBcan-II family

CAN to USB interfaces sold by the Swedish manufacturer Kvaser are
divided into two major families: 'Leaf', and 'USBcanII'.  From an
Operating System perspective, the firmware of both families behave
in a not too drastically different fashion.

This patch adds support for the USBcanII family of devices to the
current Kvaser Leaf-only driver.

CAN frames sending, receiving, and error handling paths has been
tested using the dual-channel "Kvaser USBcan II HS/LS" dongle. It
should also work nicely with other products in the same category.

List of new devices supported by this driver update:

         - Kvaser USBcan II HS/HS
         - Kvaser USBcan II HS/LS
         - Kvaser USBcan Rugged ("USBcan Rev B")
         - Kvaser Memorator HS/HS
         - Kvaser Memorator HS/LS
         - Scania VCI2 (if you have the Kvaser logo on top)
