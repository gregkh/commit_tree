tcp: don't include Fast Open option in SYN-ACK on pure SYN-data

If a server has enabled Fast Open and it receives a pure SYN-data
packet (without a Fast Open option), it won't accept the data but it
incorrectly returns a SYN-ACK with a Fast Open cookie and also
increments the SNMP stat LINUX_MIB_TCPFASTOPENPASSIVEFAIL.

This patch makes the server include a Fast Open cookie in SYN-ACK
only if the SYN has some Fast Open option (i.e., when client
requests or presents a cookie).
