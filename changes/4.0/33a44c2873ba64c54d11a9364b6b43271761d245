fm10k: Validate VLAN ID in fm10k_update_xc_addr_pf

Currently, fm10k_update_xc_addr_pf has an issue where it does not
properly drop the upper-most four bits of the VLAN ID due to type
promotion. Resolve the issue not by masking off the bits, but by
throwing an error if the VLAN ID is out-of-bounds.
