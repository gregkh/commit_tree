drm/i915: Add ioctl to set per-context parameters

Sometimes we wish to tweak how an individual context behaves. Since we
always create a context for every filp, this means that individual
processes can fine tune their behaviour even if they do not explicitly
create a context.

The first example parameter here is to enable multi-process GPU testing,
but the interface should be able to cope with passing arbitrarily complex
parameters.
