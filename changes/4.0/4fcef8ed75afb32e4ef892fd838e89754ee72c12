Bluetooth: Fix issue with Roper Class 1 Bluetooth Dongle

The Roper Class 1 Bluetooth Dongle is another device that claims to
support Bluetooth 1.2 specification, but does not support the HCI
command for reading the local supported commands.

  < HCI Command: Read Local Version Information (0x04|0x0001) plen 0
  > HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 12
      Read Local Version Information (0x04|0x0001) ncmd 1
      status 0x00
      HCI Version: 1.2 (0x2) HCI Revision: 0x0
      LMP Version: 1.2 (0x2) LMP Subversion: 0x757
      Manufacturer: Silicon Wave (11)

It clearly claims Bluetooth 1.2 support and in that regard has the
same issue as the AVM BlueFritz! USB devices (Silicon Wave based),
but the HCI Read Local Supported Commands command fails.

  < HCI Command: Read Local Supported Commands (0x04|0x0002) plen 0
  > HCI Event: Command Status (0x0f) plen 4
      Read Local Supported Commands (0x04|0x0002) status 0x01 ncmd 1
      Error: Unknown HCI Command

Use the HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_LOCAL_COMMANDS quirk for these devices and
the failing command will be skipped.
