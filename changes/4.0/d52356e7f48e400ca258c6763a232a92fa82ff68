powerpc: fix memory corruption by pnv_alloc_idle_core_states

Space allocated for paca is based off nr_cpu_ids,
but pnv_alloc_idle_core_states() iterates paca with
cpu_nr_cores()*threads_per_core, which is using NR_CPUS.

This causes pnv_alloc_idle_core_states() to write over memory,
which is outside of paca array and may later lead to various panics.
