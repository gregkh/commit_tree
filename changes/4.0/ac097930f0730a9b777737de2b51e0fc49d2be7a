Input: synaptics - query min dimensions for fw v8.1

Query the min dimensions even if the check
SYN_EXT_CAP_REQUESTS(priv->capabilities) >= 7 fails, but we know that the
firmware version 8.1 is safe.

With that we don't need quirks for post-2013 models anymore as they expose
correct min and max dimensions.
