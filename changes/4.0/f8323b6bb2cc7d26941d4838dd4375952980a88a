pinctrl: baytrail: Relax GPIO request rules

Zotac ZBOX PI320, a Baytrail based mini-PC, has power button connected to a
GPIO pin and it is exposed to the operating system as Windows 8 button
array. This is implemented in Linux as a driver using gpio_keys.

However, BIOS on this particula machine forgot to mux the pin to be a GPIO
instead of native function, which results following message to be seen on
the console:

 byt_gpio INT33FC:02: pin 16 cannot be used as GPIO.

This causes power button to not work as the driver was not able to request
the GPIO it needs.

So instead of completely preventing this we allow turning the pin as GPIO
but issue warning that something might be wrong.
