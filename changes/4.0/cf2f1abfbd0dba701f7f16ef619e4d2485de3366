dm crypt: don't allocate pages for a partial request

Change crypt_alloc_buffer so that it only ever allocates pages for a
full request.  This is a prerequisite for the commit "dm crypt: offload
writes to thread".

This change simplifies the dm-crypt code at the expense of reduced
throughput in low memory conditions (where allocation for a partial
request is most useful).

Note: the next commit ("dm crypt: avoid deadlock in mempools") is needed
to fix a theoretical deadlock.
