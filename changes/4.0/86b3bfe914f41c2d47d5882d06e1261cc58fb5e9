pkt_sched: fq: remove useless TIME_WAIT check

TIME_WAIT sockets are not owning any skb.

ip_send_unicast_reply() and tcp_v6_send_response() both use
regular sockets.

We can safely remove a test in sch_fq and save one cache line miss,
as sk_state is far away from sk_pacing_rate.

Tested at Google for about one year.
