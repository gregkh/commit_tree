clk: sunxi: unify sun6i AHB1 clock with proper PLL6 pre-divider

This patch unifies the sun6i AHB1 clock, originally supported
with separate mux and divider clks. It also adds support for
the pre-divider on the PLL6 input, thus allowing the clock to
be muxed to PLL6 with proper clock rate calculation.
