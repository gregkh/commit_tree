tpm: TPM 2.0 FIFO Interface

Detect TPM 2.0 by sending idempotent TPM 2.x command. Ordinals for
TPM 2.0 are higher than TPM 1.x commands so this should be fail-safe.
Using STS3 is unreliable because some chips just report 0xff and not
what the spec says.

Before TPM family is detected, timeouts are set to the maximum values
for both TPM 1.x and TPM 2.x. In addition to this, suspend/resume
functionality is implemented for TPM 2.x.
