iommu/arm-smmu: fix ARM_SMMU_FEAT_TRANS_OPS condition

This patch is a fix to "iommu/arm-smmu: add support for iova_to_phys
through ATS1PR".
According to ARM documentation, translation registers are optional even
in SMMUv1, so ID0_S1TS needs to be checked to verify their presence.
Also, we check that the domain is a stage-1 domain.
