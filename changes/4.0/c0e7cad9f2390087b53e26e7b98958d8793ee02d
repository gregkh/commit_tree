mm: numa: add paranoid check around pte_protnone_numa

pte_protnone_numa is only safe to use after VMA checks for PROT_NONE are
complete.  Treating a real PROT_NONE PTE as a NUMA hinting fault is going
to result in strangeness so add a check for it.  BUG_ON looks like
overkill but if this is hit then it's a serious bug that could result in
corruption so do not even try recovering.  It would have been more
comprehensive to check VMA flags in pte_protnone_numa but it would have
made the API ugly just for a debugging check.
