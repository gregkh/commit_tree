rcu: Abstract rcu_cleanup_dead_rnp() from rcu_cleanup_dead_cpu()

This commit abstracts rcu_cleanup_dead_rnp() from rcu_cleanup_dead_cpu()
in preparation for the rework of RCU priority boosting.  This new function
will be invoked from rcu_read_unlock_special() in the reworked scheme,
which is why rcu_cleanup_dead_rnp() assumes that the leaf rcu_node
structure's ->qsmaskinit field has already been updated.
