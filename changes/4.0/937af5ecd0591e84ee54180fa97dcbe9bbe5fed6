brd: Fix all partitions BUGs

This patch fixes up brd's partitions scheme, now enjoying all worlds.

The MAIN fix here is that currently, if one fdisks some partitions,
a BAD bug will make all partitions point to the same start-end sector
ie: 0 - brd_size And an mkfs of any partition would trash the partition
table and the other partition.

Another fix is that "mount -U uuid" will not work if show_part was not
specified, because of the GENHD_FL_SUPPRESS_PARTITION_INFO flag.
We now always load without it and remove the show_part parameter.

[We remove Dmitry's new module-param part_show it is now always
 show]

So NOW the logic goes like this:
* max_part - Just says how many minors to reserve between ramX
  devices. In any way, there can be as many partition as requested.
  If minors between devices ends, then dynamic 259-major ids will
  be allocated on the fly.
  The default is now max_part=1, which means all partitions devt(s)
  will be from the dynamic (259) major-range.
  (If persistent partition minors is needed use max_part=X)
  For example with /dev/sdX max_part is hard coded 16.

* Creation of new devices on the fly still/always work:
  mknod /path/devnod b 1 X
  fdisk -l /path/devnod
  Will create a new device if [X / max_part] was not already
  created before. (Just as before)

  partitions on the dynamically created device will work as well
  Same logic applies with minors as with the pre-created ones.

TODO: dynamic grow of device size. So each device can have it's
      own size.
