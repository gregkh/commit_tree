ipv6: fix backtracking for throw routes

for throw routes to trigger evaluation of other policy rules
EAGAIN needs to be propagated up to fib_rules_lookup
similar to how its done for IPv4

A simple testcase for verification is:

ip -6 rule add lookup 33333 priority 33333
ip -6 route add throw 2001:db8::1
ip -6 route add 2001:db8::1 via fe80::1 dev wlan0 table 33333
ip route get 2001:db8::1
