x86, mrst: remove Moorestown specific serial drivers

Intel Moorestown platform support was removed few years ago. This is a follow
up which removes Moorestown specific code for the serial devices. It includes
mrst_max3110 and earlyprintk bits.

This was used on SFI (Medfield, Clovertrail) based platforms as well, though
new ones use normal serial interface for the console service.
