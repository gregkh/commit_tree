hwmon: (tmp102) add hibernation callbacks

Setting a dev_pm_ops suspend/resume pair but not a set of
hibernation functions means those pm functions will not be
called upon hibernation.
Fix this by using SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS, which appropriately
assigns the suspend and hibernation handlers and move
mp102_suspend/tmp102_resume under CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to avoid
build warnings.
