drm/i915: Zero fill the request structure

There is a general theory that kzmalloc is better/safer than kmalloc, especially
for interesting data structures. This change updates the request structure
allocation to be zero filled.

This also fixes crashes in the reset code. Quoting Mika's patch:

"Clean the request structure on alloc. Otherwise we might end up
referencing uninitialized fields.  This is apparent when we try to
cleanup the preallocated request on ring reset, before any request has
been submitted to the ring.  The request->ctx is foobar and we end up
freeing the foobarness."

Note that this fixes a regression introduced in
