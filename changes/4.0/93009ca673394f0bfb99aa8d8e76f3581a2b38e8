[media] cx23885: fix I2C scan printout

1) I2C slave addresses were printed so called 8-bit format. Use
standard 7-bit notation.

2) I2C slave address was printed with hex formatted without leading
zeros, which makes output one digit shorter in a case of address
fit to one hex digit. Use 4 char wide hex number with leading zeros
as usually used for I2C slave addresses.
