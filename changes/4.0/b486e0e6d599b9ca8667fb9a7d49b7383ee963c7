drm/atomic-helper: add connector->dpms() implementation

This builds on top of the crtc->active infrastructure to implement
legacy DPMS. My choice of semantics is somewhat arbitrary, but the
entire pipe is enabled as along as one output is still enabled.

Of course it also clamps everything that's not ON to OFF.

v2: Fix spelling in one comment.

v3: Don't do an async commit (Thierry)

v4: Dan Carpenter noticed missing error case handling.
