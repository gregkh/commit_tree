ipv6: call ipv6_proxy_select_ident instead of ipv6_select_ident in udp6_ufo_fragment

Matt Grant reported frequent crashes in ipv6_select_ident when
udp6_ufo_fragment is called from openvswitch on a skb that doesn't
have a dst_entry set.

ipv6_proxy_select_ident generates the frag_id without using the dst
associated with the skb.  This approach was suggested by Vladislav
Yasevich.
