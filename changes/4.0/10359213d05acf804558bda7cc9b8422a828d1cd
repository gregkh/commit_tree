mm: incorporate read-only pages into transparent huge pages

This patch aims to improve THP collapse rates, by allowing THP collapse in
the presence of read-only ptes, like those left in place by do_swap_page
after a read fault.

Currently THP can collapse 4kB pages into a THP when there are up to
khugepaged_max_ptes_none pte_none ptes in a 2MB range.  This patch applies
the same limit for read-only ptes.

The patch was tested with a test program that allocates 800MB of memory,
writes to it, and then sleeps.  I force the system to swap out all but
190MB of the program by touching other memory.  Afterwards, the test
program does a mix of reads and writes to its memory, and the memory gets
swapped back in.

Without the patch, only the memory that did not get swapped out remained
in THPs, which corresponds to 24% of the memory of the program.  The
percentage did not increase over time.

With this patch, after 5 minutes of waiting khugepaged had collapsed 50%
of the program's memory back into THPs.
