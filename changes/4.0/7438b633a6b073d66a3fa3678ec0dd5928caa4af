genirq / PM: describe IRQF_COND_SUSPEND

With certain restrictions it is possible for a wakeup device to share
an IRQ with an IRQF_NO_SUSPEND user, and the warnings introduced by
commit cab303be91dc47942bc25de33dc1140123540800 are spurious. The new
IRQF_COND_SUSPEND flag allows drivers to tell the core when these
restrictions are met, allowing spurious warnings to be silenced.

This patch documents how IRQF_COND_SUSPEND is expected to be used,
updating some of the text now made invalid by its addition.
