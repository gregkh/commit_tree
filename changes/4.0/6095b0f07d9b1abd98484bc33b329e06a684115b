NFC: nci: Change NCI state machine to LISTEN_ACTIVE

When receiving an interface activation notification, if
the RF interface is NCI_RF_INTERFACE_NFCEE_DIRECT, we
need to ignore the following parameters and change the NCI
state machine to NCI_LISTEN_ACTIVE. According to the NCI
specification, the parameters should be 0 and shall be
ignored.
