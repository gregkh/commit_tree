dm table: train hybrid target type detection to select blk-mq if appropriate

Otherwise replacing the multipath target with the error target fails:
  device-mapper: ioctl: can't change device type after initial table load.

The error target was mistakenly considered to be target type
DM_TYPE_REQUEST_BASED rather than DM_TYPE_MQ_REQUEST_BASED even if the
target it was to replace was of type DM_TYPE_MQ_REQUEST_BASED.
