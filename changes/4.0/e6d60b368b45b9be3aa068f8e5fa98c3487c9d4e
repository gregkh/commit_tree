s390/ftrace: hotpatch support for function tracing

Make use of gcc's hotpatch support to generate better code for ftrace
function tracing.
The generated code now contains only a six byte nop in each function
prologue instead of a 24 byte code block which will be runtime patched to
support function tracing.
With the new code generation the runtime overhead for supporting function
tracing is close to zero, while the original code did show a significant
performance impact.
