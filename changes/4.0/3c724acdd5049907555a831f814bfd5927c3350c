tipc: simplify socket multicast reception

The structure 'tipc_port_list' is used to collect port numbers
representing multicast destination socket on a receiving node.
The list is not based on a standard linked list, and is in reality
optimized for the uncommon case that there are more than one
multicast destinations per node. This makes the list handling
unecessarily complex, and as a consequence, even the socket
multicast reception becomes more complex.

In this commit, we replace 'tipc_port_list' with a new 'struct
tipc_plist', which is based on a standard list. We give the new
list stack (push/pop) semantics, someting that simplifies
the implementation of the function tipc_sk_mcast_rcv().
