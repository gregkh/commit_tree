x86: pte_protnone() and pmd_protnone() must check entry is not present

Since _PAGE_PROTNONE aliases _PAGE_GLOBAL it is only valid if
_PAGE_PRESENT is clear.  Make pte_protnone() and pmd_protnone() check
for this.

This fixes a 64-bit Xen PV guest regression introduced by 8a0516ed8b90
("mm: convert p[te|md]_numa users to p[te|md]_protnone_numa").  Any
userspace process would endlessly fault.

In a 64-bit PV guest, userspace page table entries have _PAGE_GLOBAL set
by the hypervisor.  This meant that any fault on a present userspace
entry (e.g., a write to a read-only mapping) would be misinterpreted as
a NUMA hinting fault and the fault would not be correctly handled,
resulting in the access endlessly faulting.
