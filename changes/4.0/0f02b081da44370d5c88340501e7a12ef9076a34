staging: comedi: ni_labpc_isadma: introduce labpc_isadma_disable()

Introduce a helper function to disable and the ISA DMA controller and
return the residue as described in Documentation/DMA-ISA-LPC.txt.

The DMA will always be disabled when labpc_setup_dma() is called. Remove
the unnecessary disable in that function.
