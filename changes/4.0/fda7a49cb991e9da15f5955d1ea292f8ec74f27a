NFC: hci: Change event_received handler gate parameter to pipe

Several pipes may point to the same CLF gate, so getting the gate ID
as an input is not enough.
For example dual secure element may have 2 pipes (1 for uicc and
1 for eSE) pointing to the connectivity gate.

As resolving gate and host IDs can be done from a pipe, we now pass
the pipe ID to the event received handler.
