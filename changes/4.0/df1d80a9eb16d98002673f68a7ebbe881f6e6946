lib/bitmap.c: simplify bitmap_pos_to_ord

The ordinal of a set bit is simply the number of set bits before it;
counting those doesn't need to be done one bit at a time.  While at it,
update the parameters to unsigned int.

It is not completely unthinkable that gcc would see pos as compile-time
constant 0 in one of the uses of bitmap_pos_to_ord.  Since the static
inline frontend bitmap_weight doesn't handle nbits==0 correctly (it would
behave exactly as if nbits==BITS_PER_LONG), use __bitmap_weight.

Alternatively, the last line could be spelled bitmap_weight(buf, pos+1)-1,
but this is simpler.
