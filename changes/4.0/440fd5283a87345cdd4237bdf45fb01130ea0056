drm/mm: Support 4 GiB and larger ranges

The current implementation is limited by the number of addresses that
fit into an unsigned long. This causes problems on 32-bit Tegra where
unsigned long is 32-bit but drm_mm is used to manage an IOVA space of
4 GiB. Given the 32-bit limitation, the range is limited to 4 GiB - 1
(or 4 GiB - 4 KiB for page granularity).

This commit changes the start and size of the range to be an unsigned
64-bit integer, thus allowing much larger ranges to be supported.
