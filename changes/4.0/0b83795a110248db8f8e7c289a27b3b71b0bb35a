iwlwifi: mvm: fix rx chains configuration in phy ctxt cmd

In the PHY_CTXT command sent to the FW the TX chains were
indeed configured by the values of both FW TLVs and of NVM,
but the RX chains were left out and configured only by FW
TLV.

This causes problems in 4165 HW, where there are 1x1
antennas, and the wrong configuration denies the driver
from connecting to the AP.
