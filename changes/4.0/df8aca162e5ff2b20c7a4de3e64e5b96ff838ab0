mmc: slot-gpio: Rework how to handle allocation of slot-gpio data

By moving the allocation of the slot-gpio data into mmc_alloc_host(),
we can remove the slot-gpio internal calls to mmc_gpio_alloc().

This means mmc_gpio_alloc() has now only one caller left, which
consequence allow us to simplify and remove some of the slot-gpio code.

Additionally, this makes the slot-gpio mutex redundant, so let's remove
it.
