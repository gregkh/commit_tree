ocfs2/dlm: add missing dlm_lock_put() when recovery master down

When the recovery master is down, the owner of $RECOVERY calls
dlm_do_local_recovery_cleanup() to prune any $RECOVERY entries for dead
nodes.  The lock is in the granted list and the refcount must be 2.  We
should put twice to remove this lock.  Otherwise, it will lead to a memory
leak.
