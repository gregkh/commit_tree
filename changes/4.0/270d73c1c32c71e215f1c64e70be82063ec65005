irda: Removed all unused timeval variables

In the file au1k_ir.c & via-ircc.h, there were two unused definitions of the
timeval type members, this commit therefore removes this unneeded code.

In other three files, the same problem is the rx_time member is only ever
written, never read, so removed it entirely.
