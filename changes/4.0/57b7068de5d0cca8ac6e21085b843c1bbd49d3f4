ASoC: add xtensa xtfpga I2S interface and platform

XTFPGA boards provides an audio subsystem that consists of TI CDCE706
clock synthesizer, I2S transmitter and TLV320AIC23 audio codec.

I2S transmitter has MMIO-based interface that resembles that of the
OpenCores I2S transmitter. I2S transmitter is always a master on I2S
bus. There's no specialized audio DMA, sample data are transferred to
I2S transmitter FIFO by CPU through memory-mapped queue interface.
