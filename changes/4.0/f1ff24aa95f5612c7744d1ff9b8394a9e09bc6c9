cxgb4: Add support for cim_la entry in debugfs

The CIM LA captures the embedded processorâ€™s internal state. Optionally, it can
also trace the flow of data in and out of the embedded processor. Therefore, the
CIM LA output contains detailed information of what code the embedded processor
executed prior to the CIM LA capture.
