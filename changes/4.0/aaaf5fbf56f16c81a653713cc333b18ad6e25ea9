rtc: add driver for DS1685 family of real time clocks

This adds a driver for the Dallas/Maxim DS1685-family of RTC chips.  It
supports the DS1685/DS1687, DS1688/DS1691, DS1689/DS1693, DS17285/DS17287,
DS17485/DS17487, and DS17885/DS17887 RTC chips.  These chips are commonly
found in SGI O2 and SGI Octane systems.  It was originally derived from a
driver patch submitted by Matthias Fuchs many years ago for use in
EPPC-405-UC modules, which also used these RTCs.  In addition to the
time-keeping functions, this RTC also handles the shutdown mechanism of
the O2 and Octane and acts as a partial NVRAM for the boot PROMS in these
systems.

Verified on both an SGI O2 and an SGI Octane.
