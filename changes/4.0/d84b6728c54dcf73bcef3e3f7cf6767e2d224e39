locking/mcs: Better differentiate between MCS variants

We have two flavors of the MCS spinlock: standard and cancelable (OSQ).
While each one is independent of the other, we currently mix and match
them. This patch:

  - Moves the OSQ code out of mcs_spinlock.h (which only deals with the traditional
    version) into include/linux/osq_lock.h. No unnecessary code is added to the
    more global header file, anything locks that make use of OSQ must include
    it anyway.

  - Renames mcs_spinlock.c to osq_lock.c. This file only contains osq code.

  - Introduces a CONFIG_LOCK_SPIN_ON_OWNER in order to only build osq_lock
    if there is support for it.
