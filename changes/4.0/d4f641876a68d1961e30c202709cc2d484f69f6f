tty/serial: at91: enable peripheral clock before accessing I/O registers

atmel_serial_probe() calls atmel_init_port(). In turn, atmel_init_port() calls
clk_disable_unprepare() to disable the peripheral clock before returning.

Later atmel_serial_probe() accesses some I/O registers such as the Mode and
Control registers for RS485 support then the Name and Version registers, through a call to
atmel_get_ip_name(), but at that moment the peripheral clock was still
disabled.
