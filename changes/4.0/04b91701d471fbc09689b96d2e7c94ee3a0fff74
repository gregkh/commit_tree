ARM: fix typos in smc91x platform data

I recently did a rework of the smc91x driver and did some build-testing
by compiling hundreds of randconfig kernels. Unfortunately, my script
was wrong and did not actually test the configurations that mattered,
so I introduced stupid typos in almost every file I touched.

I fixed my script now, built all configurations that actually matter
and fixed all the typos, this is the result.
