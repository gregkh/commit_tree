tcp: fix tcp_should_expand_sndbuf() to use tcp_packets_in_flight()

tcp_should_expand_sndbuf() does not expand the send buffer if we have
filled the congestion window.

However, it should use tcp_packets_in_flight() instead of
tp->packets_out to make this check.

Testing has established that the difference matters a lot if there are
many SACKed packets, causing a needless performance shortfall.
