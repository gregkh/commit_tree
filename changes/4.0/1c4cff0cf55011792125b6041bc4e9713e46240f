gen_stats.c: Duplicate xstats buffer for later use

The gnet_stats_copy_app() function gets called, more often than not, with its
second argument a pointer to an automatic variable in the caller's stack.
Therefore, to avoid copying garbage afterwards when calling
gnet_stats_finish_copy(), this data is better copied to a dynamically allocated
memory that gets freed after use.
