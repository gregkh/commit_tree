net: hisilicon: new hip04 ethernet driver

Support Hisilicon hip04 ethernet driver, including 100M / 1000M controller.
The controller has no tx done interrupt, reclaim xmitted buffer in the poll.

v13: Fix the problem of alignment parameters for function and checkpatch warming.

v12: According Alex's suggestion, modify the changelog and add MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
     for hip04 ethernet.

v11: Add ethtool support for tx coalecse getting and setting, the xmit_more
     is not supported for this patch, but I think it could work for hip04,
     will support it later after some tests for performance better.

     Here are some performance test results by ping and iperf(add tx_coalesce_frames/users),
     it looks that the performance and latency is more better by tx_coalesce_frames/usecs.

     - Before:
     $ ping 192.168.1.1 ...
     === 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ===
     24 packets transmitted, 24 received, 0% packet loss, time 22999ms
     rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.180/0.202/0.403/0.043 ms

     $ iperf -c 192.168.1.1 ...
     [ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
     [  3]  0.0- 1.0 sec   115 MBytes   945 Mbits/sec

     - After:
     $ ping 192.168.1.1 ...
     === 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ===
     24 packets transmitted, 24 received, 0% packet loss, time 22999ms
     rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.178/0.190/0.380/0.041 ms

     $ iperf -c 192.168.1.1 ...
     [ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
     [  3]  0.0- 1.0 sec   115 MBytes   965 Mbits/sec

v10: According David Miller and Arnd Bergmann's suggestion, add some modification
     for v9 version
     - drop the workqueue
     - batch cleanup based on tx_coalesce_frames/usecs for better throughput
     - use a reasonable default tx timeout (200us, could be shorted
       based on measurements) with a range timer
     - fix napi poll function return value
     - use a lockless queue for cleanup
