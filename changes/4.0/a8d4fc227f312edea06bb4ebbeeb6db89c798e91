ACPI / EC: Update revision due to raw handler mode.

The bug fixes around GPE races have been done to the EC driver by the
previous commits. This patch increases the revision to 3 to indicate the
behavior differences between the old and the new drivers. The
copyright/authorship notices are also updated.
