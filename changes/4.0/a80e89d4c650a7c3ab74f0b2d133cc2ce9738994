fib_trie: Fall back to slen update on inflate/halve failure

This change corrects an issue where if inflate or halve fails we were
exiting the resize function without at least updating the slen for the
node.  To correct this I have moved the update of max_size into the while
loop so that it is only decremented on a successful call to either inflate
or halve.
