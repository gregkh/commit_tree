RDMA/ocrdma: Use unsigned for bit index

In the expressions idx/32 and idx%32, both idx and 32 have signed
type, and unfortunately the C standard prescribes rounding to 0, so
unless gcc can prove that idx is non-negative, these cannot be
implemented as simple shift respectively mask operations. Help gcc by
changing the type of idx to unsigned - this cuts another few
instructions from the generated code.
