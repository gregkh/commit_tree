ALSA: usb: update trigger timestamp on first non-zero URB submitted

The first URBs are submitted during the prepare stage. When .trigger is
called, the ALSA core saves a trigger tstamp that doesn't correspond to
the actual time when the samples are submitted. The trigger_tstamp is
now updated when the first data are submitted to avoid any time offsets.

A usb-specific trigger_tstamp_pending_update flag is used for now,
at some point the flag would need to move to the ALSA core, USB
is not the only interface where silent block transfers are programmed
as part of the prepare stage, with actual data enabled when .trigger
is called.
