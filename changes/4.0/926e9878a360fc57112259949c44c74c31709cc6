phonet netlink: allow multiple messages per skb in route dump

My previous patch to this file changed the code to be bug-compatible
towards userspace. Unless userspace (which I wasn't able to find)
implements the dump reader by hand in a wrong way, this isn't needed.
If it uses libnl or similar code putting multiple messages into a
single SKB is far more efficient.

Change the code to do this. While at it, also clean it up and don't
use so many variables - just store the address in the callback args
directly.
