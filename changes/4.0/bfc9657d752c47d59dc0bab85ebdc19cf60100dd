ARM: optprobes: execute instruction during restoring if possible.

This patch removes software emulation or simulation for most of probed
instructions. If the instruction doesn't use PC relative addressing,
it will be translated into following instructions in the restore code
in code template:

 ldmia {r0 - r14}  // restore all instruction except PC
 <instruction>     // direct execute the probed instruction
 b next_insn       // branch to next instruction.
