sparc: Touch NMI watchdog when walking cpus and calling printk

With the increase in number of CPUs calls to functions that dump
output to console (e.g., arch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace) can take
a long time to complete. If IRQs are disabled eventually the NMI
watchdog kicks in and creates more havoc. Avoid by telling the NMI
watchdog everything is ok.
