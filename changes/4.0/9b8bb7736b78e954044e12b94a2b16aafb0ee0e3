clocksource: Driver for Conexant Digicolor SoC timer

Add clocksource driver to the Conexant CX92755 SoC, part of the Digicolor SoCs
series. Hardware provides 8 timers, A to H. Timer A is dedicated to a future
watchdog driver so we don't use it here. Use timer B for sched_clock, and timer
C for clock_event.
