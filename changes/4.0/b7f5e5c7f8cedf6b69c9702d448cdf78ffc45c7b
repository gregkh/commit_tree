rhashtable: don't allocate ht structure on stack in test_rht_init

With object runtime debugging enabled, the rhashtable test suite
will rightfully throw a warning "ODEBUG: object is on stack, but
not annotated" from rhashtable_init().

This is because run_work is (correctly) being initialized via
INIT_WORK(), and not annotated by INIT_WORK_ONSTACK(). Meaning,
rhashtable_init() is okay as is, we just need to move ht e.g.,
into global scope.

It never triggered anything, since test_rhashtable is rather a
controlled environment and effectively runs to completion, so
that stack memory is not vanishing underneath us, we shouldn't
confuse any testers with it though.
