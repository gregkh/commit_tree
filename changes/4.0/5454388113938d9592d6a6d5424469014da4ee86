kdb: Remove stack dump when entering kgdb due to NMI

Issuing a stack dump feels ergonomically wrong when entering due to NMI.

Entering due to NMI is normally a reaction to a user request, either the
NMI button on a server or a "magic knock" on a UART. Therefore the
backtrace behaviour on entry due to NMI should be like SysRq-g (no stack
dump) rather than like oops.

Note also that the stack dump does not offer any information that
cannot be trivial retrieved using the 'bt' command.
