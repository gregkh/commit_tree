tipc: remove tipc_core_start/stop routines

Remove redundant wrapper functions like tipc_core_start() and
tipc_core_stop(), and directly move them to their callers, such
as tipc_init() and tipc_exit(), having us clearly know what are
really done in both initialization and deinitialzation functions.
