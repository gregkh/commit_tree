Bluetooth: Add hci_request support for hci_update_background_scan

Many places using hci_update_background_scan() try to synchronize
whatever they're doing with the help of hci_request callbacks. However,
since the hci_update_background_scan() function hasn't so far accepted a
hci_request pointer any commands triggered by it have been left out by
the synchronization. This patch modifies the API in a similar way as was
done for hci_update_page_scan, i.e. there's a variant that takes a
hci_request and another one that takes a hci_dev.
