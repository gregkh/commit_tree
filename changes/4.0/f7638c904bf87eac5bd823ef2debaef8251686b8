dmaengine: rcar-dmac: Fix oops due to unintialized list in error ISR

The error interrupt handler stops and reinitializes all channels. This
causes a crash for channels that have never been used, as their
descriptor lists are uninitialized. Fix it by initializing the
descriptor lists at probe time.
