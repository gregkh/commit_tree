f2fs: introduce a batched trim

This patch introduces a batched trimming feature, which submits split discard
commands.

This is to avoid long latency due to huge trim commands.
If fstrim was triggered ranging from 0 to the end of device, we should lock
all the checkpoint-related mutexes, resulting in very long latency.
