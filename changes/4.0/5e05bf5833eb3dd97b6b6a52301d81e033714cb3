virtio: Avoid possible kernel panic if DEBUG is enabled.

The virtqueue_add() calls START_USE() upon entry. The virtqueue_kick() is
called if vq->num_added == (1 << 16) - 1 before calling END_USE().
The virtqueue_kick_prepare() called via virtqueue_kick() calls START_USE()
upon entry, and will call panic() if DEBUG is enabled.
Move this virtqueue_kick() call to after END_USE() call.
