staging: comedi: ni_at_a2150: introduce a2150_alloc_irq_dma()

This driver requires an IRQ and DMA in order to support async commands.

For aesthetics, introduce a helper function to request the IRQ and DMA
channels and allocate the DMA buffer. Since the async command support
is optional, make the helper function handle any request/allocation
errors and allow the driver to still attach without async command support.
