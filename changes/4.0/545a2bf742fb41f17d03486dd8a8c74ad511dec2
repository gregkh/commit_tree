kernel/sched/clock.c: add another clock for use with the soft lockup watchdog

When the hypervisor pauses a virtualised kernel the kernel will observe a
jump in timebase, this can cause spurious messages from the softlockup
detector.

Whilst these messages are harmless, they are accompanied with a stack
trace which causes undue concern and more problematically the stack trace
in the guest has nothing to do with the observed problem and can only be
misleading.

Futhermore, on POWER8 this is completely avoidable with the introduction
of the Virtual Time Base (VTB) register.

This patch (of 2):

This permits the use of arch specific clocks for which virtualised kernels
can use their notion of 'running' time, not the elpased wall time which
will include host execution time.
