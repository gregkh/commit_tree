lib: bitmap: remove redundant code from __bitmap_shift_right

If the condition k==lim-1 is true, we must have off == 0 (otherwise, k
could never become that big).  But in that case we have upper == 0 and
hence dst[k] == (src[k] & mask) >> rem.  Since mask consists of a
consecutive range of bits starting from the LSB, anding dst[k] with mask
is a no-op.
