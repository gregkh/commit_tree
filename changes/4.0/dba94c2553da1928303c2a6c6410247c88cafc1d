lib: bitmap: change bitmap_shift_left to take unsigned parameters

gcc can generate slightly better code for stuff like "nbits %
BITS_PER_LONG" when it knows nbits is not negative.  Since negative size
bitmaps or shift amounts don't make sense, change these parameters of
bitmap_shift_right to unsigned.

If off >= lim (which requires shift >= nbits), k is initialized with a
large positive value, but since I've let k continue to be signed, the loop
will never run and dst will be zeroed as expected.  Inside the loop, k is
guaranteed to be non-negative, so the fact that it is promoted to unsigned
in the various expressions it appears in is harmless.

Also use "shift" and "nbits" consistently for the parameter names.
