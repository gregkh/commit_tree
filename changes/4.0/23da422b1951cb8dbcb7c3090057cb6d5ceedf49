md: use mddev->lock to protect updates to resync_{min,max}.

There are interdependencies between these two sysfs attributes
and whether a resync is currently running.

Rather than depending on reconfig_mutex to ensure no races when
testing these interdependencies are met, use the spinlock.
This will allow the mutex to be remove from protecting this
code in a subsequent patch.
