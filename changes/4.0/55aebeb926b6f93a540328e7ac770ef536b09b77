iio: core: Introduce IIO_ACTIVITY channel

This channel will be used for exposing information about
activity composite sensors. Activities supported so far:
	* running
	* jogging
	* walking
	* still

THRESHOLD event is used to signal a change in the activity
state.

We associate a confidence interval for each activity expressed
as a percentage from 0 to 100.
  * 0, means the sensor IS NOT reporting that activity.
  * 100, means the sensor IS reporting that activity.

Users of this interface have two possible means to gather
information about the ongoing activities.

1. Event based, via event file descriptor
  * sensor may report an event when ENTERING an activity or LEAVING
    an activity based on a threshold value.
  * drivers will wake up applications waiting data on the event fd

2. Polling, by reading the sysfs associated attribute files:
  * /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_activity_running_input
expressed as percentage confidence value from 0 to 100.

This will offer an interface for Android significant motion
composite sensor defined here:

Activities listed above are supported by Freescale's MMA9553 sensor:
