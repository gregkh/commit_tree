x86, init: Fix UP boot regression on x86_64

Commit 30b8b0066caf "init: Get rid of x86isms" broke the UP boot on
x86_64. That happens because CONFIG_UP_LATE_INIT depends on
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC. X86_UP_APIC is a 32bit only config switch and
therefor not set on 64bit UP builds. As a consequence the UP init of
the local APIC and the IOAPIC is not called, which results in a boot
failure.

Make it depend on !SMP && X86_LOCAL_APIC instead.
