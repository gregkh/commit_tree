tracing: Fix unmapping loop in tracing_mark_write

Commit 6edb2a8a385f0cdef51dae37ff23e74d76d8a6ce introduced
an array map_pages that contains the addresses returned by
kmap_atomic. However, when unmapping those pages, map_pages[0]
is unmapped before map_pages[1], breaking the nesting requirement
as specified in the documentation for kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic.

This was caught by the highmem debug code present in kunmap_atomic.
Fix the loop to do the unmapping properly.
