rbd: do not treat standalone as flatten

If the clone is resized down to 0, it becomes standalone.  If such
resize is carried over while an image is mapped we would detect this
and call rbd_dev_parent_put() which means "let go of all parent state,
including the spec(s) of parent images(s)".  This leads to a mismatch
between "rbd info" and sysfs parent fields, so a fix is in order.

    # rbd create --image-format 2 --size 1 foo
    # rbd snap create foo@snap
    # rbd snap protect foo@snap
    # rbd clone foo@snap bar
    # DEV=$(rbd map bar)
    # rbd resize --allow-shrink --size 0 bar
    # rbd resize --size 1 bar
    # rbd info bar | grep parent
            parent: rbd/foo@snap

Before:

    # cat /sys/bus/rbd/devices/0/parent
    (no parent image)

After:

    # cat /sys/bus/rbd/devices/0/parent
    pool_id 0
    pool_name rbd
    image_id 10056b8b4567
    image_name foo
    snap_id 2
    snap_name snap
    overlap 0
