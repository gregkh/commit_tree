perf/x86: Only allow rdpmc if a perf_event is mapped

We currently allow any process to use rdpmc.  This significantly
weakens the protection offered by PR_TSC_DISABLED, and it could be
helpful to users attempting to exploit timing attacks.

Since we can't enable access to individual counters, use a very
coarse heuristic to limit access to rdpmc: allow access only when
a perf_event is mmapped.  This protects seccomp sandboxes.

There is plenty of room to further tighen these restrictions.  For
example, this allows rdpmc for any x86_pmu event, but it's only
useful for self-monitoring tasks.

As a side effect, cap_user_rdpmc will now be false for AMD uncore
events.  This isn't a real regression, since .event_idx is disabled
for these events anyway for the time being.  Whenever that gets
re-added, the cap_user_rdpmc code can be adjusted or refactored
accordingly.
