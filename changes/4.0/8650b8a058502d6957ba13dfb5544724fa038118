nfsd: pNFS block layout driver

Add a small shim between core nfsd and filesystems to translate the
somewhat cumbersome pNFS data structures and semantics to something
more palatable for Linux filesystems.

Thanks to Rick McNeal for the old prototype pNFS blocklayout server
code, which gave a lot of inspiration to this version even if no
code is left from it.
