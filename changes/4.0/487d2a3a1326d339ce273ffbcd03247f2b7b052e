tipc: convert legacy nl socket dump to nl compat

Convert socket (port) listing to compat dumpit call. If a socket
(port) has publications a second dumpit call is issued to collect them
and format then into the legacy buffer before continuing to process
the sockets (ports).

Command converted in this patch:
TIPC_CMD_SHOW_PORTS
