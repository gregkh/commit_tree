module: Replace over-engineered nested sleep

Since the introduction of the nested sleep warning; we've established
that the occasional sleep inside a wait_event() is fine.

wait_event() loops are invariant wrt. spurious wakeups, and the
occasional sleep has a similar effect on them. As long as its occasional
its harmless.

Therefore replace the 'correct' but verbose wait_woken() thing with
a simple annotation to shut up the warning.
