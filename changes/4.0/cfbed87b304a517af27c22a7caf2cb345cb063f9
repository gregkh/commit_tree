ath9k: Enable manual peak detect calibration

On some AR955x/QCA953x boards, noise floor calibration
gets stuck and the cause is a hardware/BB issue. To fix
this, peak detect calibration in the HW is disabled
and is done in the driver instead. There a few differences
with the calibration routine for older chips like
AR9331.
