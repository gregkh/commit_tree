drm/imx: imx-ldb: enable DI clock in encoder_mode_set

Commit eb10d6355532 ("imx-drm: encoder prepare/mode_set must use adjusted mode")
broke the first LVDS modeset by using crtc->hwmode before crtc mode_set is
called. In fact, encoder prepare is not supposed to prepare the display clock
at all. Rather encoder mode_set should be used to set the DI clock rate, before
it is enabled by crtc commit.
