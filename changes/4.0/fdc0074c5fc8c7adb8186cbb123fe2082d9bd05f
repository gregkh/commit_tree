ARM: sunxi: Have ARCH_SUNXI select RESET_CONTROLLER for clock driver usage

As the sunxi usb clocks all contain a reset controller, it is not
possible to build the sunxi clock driver without RESET_CONTROLLER
enabled. Doing so results in an undefined symbol error:

    drivers/built-in.o: In function `sunxi_gates_clk_setup':
    linux/drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c:1071: undefined reference to
	`reset_controller_register'

This is possible if building a minimal kernel without PHY_SUN4I_USB.

The dependency issue is made visible at compile time instead of
link time by the new A80 mmc clocks, which also use a reset control
itself.

This patch makes ARCH_SUNXI select ARCH_HAS_RESET_CONTROLLER and
RESET_CONTROLLER.
