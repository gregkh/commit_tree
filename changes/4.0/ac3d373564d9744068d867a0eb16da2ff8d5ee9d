arm/arm64: KVM: allow userland to request a virtual GICv3

With all of the GICv3 code in place now we allow userland to ask the
kernel for using a virtual GICv3 in the guest.
Also we provide the necessary support for guests setting the memory
addresses for the virtual distributor and redistributors.
This requires some userland code to make use of that feature and
explicitly ask for a virtual GICv3.
Document that KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP only works for GICv2, but is
considered legacy and using KVM_CREATE_DEVICE is preferred.
