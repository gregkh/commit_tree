nfs: count DIO good bytes correctly with mirroring

When resending to MDS, we might resend multiple mirroring
requests to MDS. As a result, nfs_direct_good_bytes() ends
up counting bytes multiple times, causing application to
get wrong return results in read/write syscalls.

Fix it by tracking start of a dreq and checking the range of
pgio header.
