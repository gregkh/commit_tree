libata: use blk taging

libata uses its own tag management which is duplication and the
implementation is poor. And if we switch to blk-mq, tag is build-in.
It's time to switch to generic taging.

The SAS driver has its own tag management, and looks we can't directly
map the host controler tag to SATA tag. So I just bypassed the SAS case.

I changed the code/variable name for the tag management of libata to
make it self contained. Only sas will use it. Later if libsas implements
its tag management, the tag management code in libata can be deleted
easily.
