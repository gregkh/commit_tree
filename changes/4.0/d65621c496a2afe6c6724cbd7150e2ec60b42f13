drm/i915: Don't read 'HEAD' MMIO register in LRC mode

The logical ring code was updating the software ring 'head' value
by reading the hardware 'HEAD' register. In LRC mode, this is not
valid as the hardware is not necessarily executing the same context
that is being processed by the software. Thus reading the h/w HEAD
could put an unrelated (undefined, effectively random) value into
the s/w 'head' -- A Bad Thing for the free space calculations.
