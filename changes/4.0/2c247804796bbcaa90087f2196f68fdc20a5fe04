Revert "usb: gadget: zero: Add support for interrupt EP"

This reverts commit ef11982dd7a657512c362242508bb4021e0d67b6.

That commit creates a problem for some UDCs (at least musb)
where it allocates an endpoints with a 64-byte FIFO, but later
tries to use that same FIFO for 1024-byte packets.

Before implementing this, composite framework needs to be
modified so we only allocate endpoints after we know negotiated
speed, however that needs quite a bit of extra work.
