Bluetooth: btusb: Ignore unknown Intel devices with generic descriptor

The Intel Bluetooth devices use the generic USB device/interface class
descriptors that are assigned to Bluetooth H:2 conforming transports.

T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=01 Cnt=02 Dev#=  3 Spd=12   MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 2.01 Cls=e0(wlcon) Sub=01 Prot=01 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1

However newer chips have a bootloader stage and require firmware to
be loaded before they are functional. To avoid any confusion for the
users, just ignore unknown Intel Bluetooth devices.

All the released Intel Bluetooth devices have an entry in the device
table identifying their setup and support requirements. The advantage
here is that older kernel can be booted with newer devices without
causing any disturbance.
