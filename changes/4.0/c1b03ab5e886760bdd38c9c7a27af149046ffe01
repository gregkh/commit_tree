iio: core: Fix double free.

When an error occurred during event registration memory was freed twice
resulting in kernel memory corruption and a crash in unrelated code.

The problem was caused by
	iio_device_unregister_eventset()
	iio_device_unregister_sysfs()

being called twice, once on the error path and then
again via iio_dev_release().

Fix this by making these two functions idempotent so they
may be called multiple times.

The problem was observed before applying
	78b33216 iio:core: Handle error when mask type is not separate
