openvswitch: Add support for checksums on UDP tunnels.

Currently, it isn't possible to request checksums on the outer UDP
header of tunnels - the TUNNEL_CSUM flag is ignored. This adds
support for requesting that UDP checksums be computed on transmit
and properly reported if they are present on receive.
