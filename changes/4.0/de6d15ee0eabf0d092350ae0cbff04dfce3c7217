staging: unisys: get rid of channel stub

The functions in channels/* aren't used in a lot of places. In fact, the
functions in channel.c can be moved to uislib/uisqueue.c, and the rest
of the files in channels can be eliminated.

This patch deletes the channels directory and files, removes it from all
Kconfigs that referenced them, removes the reference in the Makefile,
and moves the functions inside of channels.c to uislib/uisqueue.c.
