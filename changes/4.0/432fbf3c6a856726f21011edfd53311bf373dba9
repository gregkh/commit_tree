documentation: Record limitations of bitfields and small variables

This commit documents the fact that it is not safe to use bitfields
as shared variables in synchronization algorithms.  It also documents
that CPUs must be able to concurrently load from and store to adjacent
one-byte and two-byte variables, which is in fact required by the
C11 standard (Section 3.14).
