mm: thp: Return the correct value for change_huge_pmd

The wrong value is being returned by change_huge_pmd since commit
10c1045f28e8 ("mm: numa: avoid unnecessary TLB flushes when setting
NUMA hinting entries") which allows a fallthrough that tries to adjust
non-existent PTEs. This patch corrects it.
