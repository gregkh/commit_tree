vmstat: Reduce time interval to stat update on idle cpu

It was noted that the vm stat shepherd runs every 2 seconds and that the
vmstat update is then scheduled 2 seconds in the future.

This yields an interval of double the time interval which is not desired.

Change the shepherd so that it does not delay the vmstat update on the
other cpu.  We stil have to use schedule_delayed_work since we are using a
delayed_work_struct but we can set the delay to 0.
