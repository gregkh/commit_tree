[media] rtl2832: define more demod lock statuses

Demod lock flags are derived from demod state machine states. States
are running from 1 to 11, where highest state 11 means demod is
fully locked and streaming. Naturally smaller state numbers means
there is some partial locks.

Define now state 10 as missing synch and lock.
