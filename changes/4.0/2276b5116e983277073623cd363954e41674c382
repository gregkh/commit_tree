KVM: x86: ARPL emulation can cause spurious exceptions

ARPL and MOVSXD are encoded the same and their execution depends on the
execution mode.  The operand sizes of each instruction are different.
Currently, ARPL is detected too late, after the decoding was already done, and
therefore may result in spurious exception (instead of failed emulation).

Introduce a group to the emulator to handle instructions according to execution
mode (32/64 bits). Note: in order not to make changes that may affect
performance, the new ModeDual can only be applied to instructions with ModRM.
