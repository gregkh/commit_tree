powerpc/book3s: Fix the MCE code to use CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER

commit id 2ba9f0d has changed CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV to tristate to allow
HV/PR bits to be built as modules. But the MCE code still depends on
CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV which is wrong. When user selects
CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV=m to build HV/PR bits as a separate module the
relevant MCE code gets excluded.

This patch fixes the MCE code to use CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER. This
makes sure that the relevant MCE code is included when HV/PR bits
are built as a separate modules.
