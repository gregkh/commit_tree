drm/i915/vlv: save/restore the power context base reg

Some BIOSes (e.g. the one on the Minnowboard) don't save/restore this
reg.  If it's unlocked, we can just restore the previous value, and if
it's locked (in case the BIOS re-programmed it for us) the write will be
ignored and we'll still have "did it move" sanity check in the PM code to
warn us if something is still amiss.
