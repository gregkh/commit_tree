KVM: x86: Wrong operand size for far ret

Indeed, Intel SDM specifically states that for the RET instruction "In 64-bit
mode, the default operation size of this instruction is the stack-address size,
i.e. 64 bits."

However, experiments show this is not the case. Here is for example objdump of
small 64-bit asm:

  4004f1:	ca 14 00             	lret   $0x14
  4004f4:	48 cb                	lretq
  4004f6:	48 ca 14 00          	lretq  $0x14

Therefore, remove the Stack flag from far-ret instructions.
