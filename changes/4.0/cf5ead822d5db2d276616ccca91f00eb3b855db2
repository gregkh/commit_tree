cfg80211: allow including station info in delete event

When a station is removed, its statistics may be interesting to
userspace, for example for further aggregation of statistics of
all stations that ever connected to an AP.

Introduce a new cfg80211_del_sta_sinfo() function (and make the
cfg80211_del_sta() a static inline calling it) to allow passing
a struct station_info along with this, and send the data in the
nl80211 event message.
