rcu: Don't initiate RCU priority boosting on root rcu_node

Because there is no longer any preempted tasks on the root rcu_node, and
because there is no longer ever an rcub kthread for the root rcu_node,
this commit drops the code in force_qs_rnp() that attempts to awaken
the non-existent root rcub kthread.  This is strictly a performance
enhancement, removing a root rcu_node ->lock acquisition and release
along with some tests in rcu_initiate_boost(), ending with the test that
notes that there is no rcub kthread.
