wake up system even if all SOC clocks are gate. The patch doing below things:
- flagging the device as a wakeup source for the system, as well as
  its Wake-on-LAN interrupt
- prepare the hardware for entering WoL mode
- add standard ethtool WOL interface
- enable the ENET interrupt to wake us

Tested on i.MX6q/dl sabresd, sabreauto boards, i.MX6SX arm2 boards.
