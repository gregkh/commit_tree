arm/arm64: KVM: move kvm_register_device_ops() into vGIC probing

Currently we unconditionally register the GICv2 emulation device
during the host's KVM initialization. Since with GICv3 support we
may end up with only v2 or only v3 or both supported, we move the
registration into the GIC probing function, where we will later know
which combination is valid.
