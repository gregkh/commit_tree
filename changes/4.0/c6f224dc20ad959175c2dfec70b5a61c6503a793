ALSA: firewire-lib: remove reference counting

AMDTP helper functions increment/decrement reference counter for an
instance of FireWire unit, while it's complicated for each driver to
process error state.

In previous commit, each driver has the role of reference counting. This
commit removes this role from the helper function.
