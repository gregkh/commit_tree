Bluetooth: Introduce HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_LOCAL_COMMANDS constant

Some controllers advertise support for Bluetooth 1.2 specification,
but they do not support the HCI Read Local Supported Commands command.

If that is the case, then the driver can quirk the behavior and force
the core to skip this command. This will allow removing vendor specific
checks out of the core.
