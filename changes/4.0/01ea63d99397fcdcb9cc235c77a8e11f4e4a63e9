ARM: sirf: add two debug ports for CSRatlas7 SoC

this patch adds UART0 and UART1 as LLUART port, as the new Atlas7
registers layout are different, it also refines some names of old
hard-coded MARCOs and uses CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_PHYS/DEBUG_UART_VIRT
to define different base addresses for multiple ports.
