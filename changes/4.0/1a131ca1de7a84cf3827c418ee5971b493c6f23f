i8k: Remove DMI config data for Latitude E6440 and E6540

Both Dell Latitude machines were tested with new fan autodetection code and they
are working fine. We already have DMI_MATCH data for generic Latitude machines
which match also E6440 and E6540 models. So we do not need to maintain DMI data
for those specific machines anymore.
