scsi_debug: Add REPORTED LUNS DATA HAS CHANGED Unit Attention

Generate a REPORTED LUNS DATA HAS CHANGED Unit Attention if
sysfs "max_luns" is used to change the number of scsi_debug LUNs.
This is only done if scsi_debug_scsi_level is SPC-3 or above.
Additionally, implement SPC-4 behavior which only generates
this Unit Attention on the first LUN on the target to receive
a command after the change.  This condition is cleared when
a REPORT LUNS command is received.
