x86/xen: require ballooned pages for grant maps

Ballooned pages are always used for grant maps which means the
original frame does not need to be saved in page->index nor restored
after the grant unmap.

This allows the workaround in netback for the conflicting use of the
(unionized) page->index and page->pfmemalloc to be removed.
