ALSA: line6: Improve line6_read/write_data() interfaces

The address cannot be negative so make it unsigned.  Also, an unsigned
int is always sufficient for the length, so no need to overdo it with a
size_t.  Finally, add in range checks to see if the values passed in
actually fit where they are used.
