drm/atomic: Fix potential use of state after free

The atomic helpers rely on drm_atomic_state_clear() to reset an atomic
state if a retry is needed due to the w/w mutexes. The subsequent calls
to drm_atomic_get_{crtc,plane,...}_state() would then return the stale
pointers in state->{crtc,plane,...}_states.
