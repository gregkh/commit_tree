block: handle the null_mapped flag correctly in blk_rq_map_user_iov

The tape drivers (and the sg driver in a special case that doesn't matter
here) use the null_mapped flag to tell blk_rq_map_user to not copy around
any data into or out of the bounce buffers.  blk_rq_map_user_iov never
got that treatment, which didn't matter until I refactored blk_rq_map_user
to be implemented in terms of blk_rq_map_user_iov.
