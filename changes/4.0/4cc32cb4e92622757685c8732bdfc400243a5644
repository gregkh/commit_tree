tools/thermal: tmon: add --target-temp parameter

If we launch in daemon mode (--daemon), we don't have the ncurses UI,
but we might want to set the target temperature still. For example,
someone might stick the following in their boot script:

  tmon --control intel_powerclamp --target-temp 90 --log --daemon

This would turn on CPU idle injection when we're around 90 degrees
celsius, and would log temperature and throttling info to
/var/tmp/tmon.log.
