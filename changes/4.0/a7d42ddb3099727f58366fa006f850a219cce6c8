nfs: add mirroring support to pgio layer

This patch adds mirrored write support to the pgio layer. The default
is to use one mirror, but pgio callers may define callbacks to change
this to any value up to the (arbitrarily selected) limit of 16.

The basic idea is to break out members of nfs_pageio_descriptor that cannot
be shared between mirrored DSes and put them in a new structure.
