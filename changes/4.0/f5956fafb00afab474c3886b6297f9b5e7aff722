net/mlx4_core: Fix wrong mask and error flow for the update-qp command

The bit mask for currently supported driver features (MLX4_UPDATE_QP_SUPPORTED_ATTRS)
of the update-qp command was defined twice (using enum value and pre-processor
define directive) and wrong.

The return value of the call to mlx4_update_qp() from within the SRIOV
resource-tracker was wrongly voided down.

Fix both issues.
