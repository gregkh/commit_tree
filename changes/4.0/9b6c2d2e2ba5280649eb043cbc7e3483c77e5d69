lib/bitmap.c: change prototype of bitmap_copy_le

Make the prototype of bitmap_copy_le the same as bitmap_copy's.  All other
bitmap_* functions take unsigned long* parameters; there's no reason this
should be special.

The only current user is the static inline uwb_mas_bm_copy_le, which
already does the void* laundering, so the end users can pass their u8 or
__le32 buffers without a cast.

Furthermore, this allows us to simply let bitmap_copy_le be an alias for
bitmap_copy on little-endian; see next patch.
