devfreq: Fix build break of devfreq-event class

This patch fixes the build break of the exynos-ppmu driver because Makefile
in drivers/devfreq don't include the entry of devfreq-event.c driver.

The original patch[1] includes the entry to build devfreq-event.c without
the build break. This build break is generated in the process of merging the
patch.
