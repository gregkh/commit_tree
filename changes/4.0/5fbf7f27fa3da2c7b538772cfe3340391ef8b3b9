Thermal/int340x: Add common thermal zone handler

Most of the processing for each int340x driver to add a thermal zone
is very similar and every driver has to duplicate code.
Created a common module, which exports API to add and remove zones.
In this way, we not only avoid duplicate code but also helps in
bug fixes and enhancements.
If for some driver default processing for thermal zone callback is
not enough they can overide individual callback.
The code for this driver is primarily copied from int3402_thermal.c.
