net: irda: fix wait_until_sent poll timeout

In case an infinite timeout (0) is requested, the irda wait_until_sent
implementation would use a zero poll timeout rather than the default
200ms.

Note that wait_until_sent is currently never called with a 0-timeout
argument due to a bug in tty_wait_until_sent.
