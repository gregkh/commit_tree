ARM: dts: sun4i: Add cpu clock reference and operating points to dtsi

The cpu core is clocked from the "cpu" clock. Add a reference to it
in the first cpu node. Also add "cpu0" label to the node.

The operating points were taken from the A10 FEX files in the
sunxi-boards repository. All FEX files have the same settings.
