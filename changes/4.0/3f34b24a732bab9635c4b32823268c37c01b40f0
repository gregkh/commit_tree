af_packet: allow packets defragmentation not only for hash fanout type

Packets defragmentation was introduced for PACKET_FANOUT_HASH only,
see 7736d33f4262 ("packet: Add pre-defragmentation support for ipv4
fanouts")

It may be useful to have defragmentation enabled regardless of
fanout type. Without that, the AF_PACKET user may have to:
1. Collect fragments from different rings
2. Defragment by itself
