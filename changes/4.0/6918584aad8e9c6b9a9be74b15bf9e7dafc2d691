lib/percpu_ida.c: remove redundant includes

These three #includes seem to be completely redundant: Removing them
yields identical objdump -d output for each of {allyes,allno,def}config,
and neither included file end up in the generated dependency file through
some recursive include.  In total, about 50 lines are eliminated from
.percpu.o.cmd.
