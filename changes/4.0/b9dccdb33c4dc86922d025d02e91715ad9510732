iwlwifi: mvm: ignore stale TDLS ch-switch responses

During out-of-channel activities (e.g. scan) TDLS ch-switch responses from
a peer are kept in FW. These packets arrive only after the out-of-channel
activity is complete, which can be in the order of several seconds.

Since TDLS ch-sw has no dialog-token-like mechanism for distinguishing
sessions, use the GP2 time of the incoming ch-switch response to discern
validity. For this purpose record the GP2 time of an outgoing TDLS ch-sw
request and compare to the Rx time of the ch-sw response.
The methods works in practice since the GP2 time of FW-deferred Rx is
accurate and contains the real Rx timestamp.
