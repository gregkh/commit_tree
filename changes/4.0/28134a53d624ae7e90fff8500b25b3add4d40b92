rhashtable: Fix potential crash on destroy in rhashtable_shrink

The current being_destroyed check in rhashtable_expand is not
enough since if we start a shrinking process after freeing all
elements in the table that's also going to crash.

This patch adds a being_destroyed check to the deferred worker
thread so that we bail out as soon as we take the lock.
