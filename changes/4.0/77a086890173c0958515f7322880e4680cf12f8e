block: keep established cmd_flags when cloning into a blk-mq request

blk_mq_alloc_request() may establish REQ_MQ_INFLIGHT in addition to
incrementing the hctx->nr_active count.  Any cmd_flags that are
established in the newly allocated clone request must be preserved in
addition to the cmd_flags that are later copied over from the original
request as part of blk_rq_prep_clone().

Otherwise, if REQ_MQ_INFLIGHT isn't set in the clone request the
hctx->nr_active count won't get decremented via blk_mq_free_request().

The only consumer of blk_rq_prep_clone() is request-based DM, which uses
blk_rq_init() prior to calling blk_rq_prep_clone() for the non-blk-mq
case.  Given the cloned request's cmd_flags will be 0 it is safe to OR
them with the original request's cmd_flags for both the non-blk-mq and
blk-mq cases.
