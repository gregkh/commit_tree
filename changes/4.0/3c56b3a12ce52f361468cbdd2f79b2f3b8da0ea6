xen/balloon: before adding hotplugged memory, set frames to invalid

Commit 25b884a83d487fd62c3de7ac1ab5549979188482 ("x86/xen: set
regions above the end of RAM as 1:1") introduced a regression.

To be able to add memory pages which were added via memory hotplug to
a pv domain, the pages must be "invalid" instead of "identity" in the
p2m list before they can be added.
