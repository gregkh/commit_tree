iio: core: Introduce IIO_CHAN_INFO_DEBOUNCE_COUNT and _TIME

The pedometer needs to filter out false steps that might be generated by
tapping the foot, sitting, etc. To do that it computes the number of
steps that occur in a given time and decides the user is moving only
if this value is over a threshold. E.g.: the user starts moving only
if he takes 4 steps in 3 seconds. This filter is applied only when
the user starts moving.

A device that has such pedometer functionality is Freescale's MMA9553L:
http://www.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/ref_manual/MMA9553LSWRM.pdf.

To export this feature, this patch introduces IIO_CHAN_INFO_DEBOUNCE_COUNT
and IIO_CHAN_INFO_DEBOUNCE_TIME. For the pedometer, in_steps_debounce_count
will specify the number of steps that need to occur in
in_steps_debounce_time seconds so that the pedometer decides the user is
moving.
