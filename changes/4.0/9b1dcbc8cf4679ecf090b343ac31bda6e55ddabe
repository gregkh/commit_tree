xprtrdma: Store RDMA credits in unsigned variables

Dan Carpenter's static checker pointed out:

   net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c:879 rpcrdma_reply_handler()
   warn: can 'credits' be negative?

"credits" is defined as an int. The credits value comes from the
server as a 32-bit unsigned integer.

A malicious or broken server can plant a large unsigned integer in
that field which would result in an underflow in the following
logic, potentially triggering a deadlock of the mount point by
blocking the client from issuing more RPC requests.

net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c:

  876          credits = be32_to_cpu(headerp->rm_credit);
  877          if (credits == 0)
  878                  credits = 1;    /* don't deadlock */
  879          else if (credits > r_xprt->rx_buf.rb_max_requests)
  880                  credits = r_xprt->rx_buf.rb_max_requests;
  881
  882          cwnd = xprt->cwnd;
  883          xprt->cwnd = credits << RPC_CWNDSHIFT;
  884          if (xprt->cwnd > cwnd)
  885                  xprt_release_rqst_cong(rqst->rq_task);
