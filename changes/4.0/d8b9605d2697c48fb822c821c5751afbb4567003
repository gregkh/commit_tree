net: sched: fix skb->protocol use in case of accelerated vlan path

tc code implicitly considers skb->protocol even in case of accelerated
vlan paths and expects vlan protocol type here. However, on rx path,
if the vlan header was already stripped, skb->protocol contains value
of next header. Similar situation is on tx path.

So for skbs that use skb->vlan_tci for tagging, use skb->vlan_proto instead.
