f2fs: avoid double lock for cp_rwsem

The __f2fs_add_link is covered by cp_rwsem all the time.
This calls init_inode_metadata, which conducts some acl operations including
memory allocation with GFP_KERNEL previously.
But, under memory pressure, f2fs_write_data_page can be called, which also
grabs cp_rwsem too.

In this case, this incurs a deadlock pointed by Chao.

 down_read
                 down_write
  down_read
 -> here down_read should wait forever.
