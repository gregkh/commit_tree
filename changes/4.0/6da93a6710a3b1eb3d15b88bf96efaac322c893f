iio: accel: mma9551: Add runtime pm support

Add support for runtime pm to reduce the power consumed by the device
when not used.

If CONFIG_PM is not enabled, the device will be powered on at
init and only powered off on system suspend.

If CONFIG_PM is enabled, runtime pm autosuspend is used:
- for raw reads will keep the device on for a specified time
- for events it will keep the device on as long as we have at least
one event active
