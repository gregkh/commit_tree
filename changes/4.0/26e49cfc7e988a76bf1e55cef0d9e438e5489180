block: pass iov_iter to the BLOCK_PC mapping functions

Make use of a new interface provided by iov_iter, backed by
scatter-gather list of iovec, instead of the old interface based on
sg_iovec. Also use iov_iter_advance() instead of manual iteration.

This commit should contain only literal replacements, without
functional changes.
