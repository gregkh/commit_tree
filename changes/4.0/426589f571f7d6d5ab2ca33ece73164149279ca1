slab: link memcg caches of the same kind into a list

Sometimes, we need to iterate over all memcg copies of a particular root
kmem cache.  Currently, we use memcg_cache_params->memcg_caches array for
that, because it contains all existing memcg caches.

However, it's a bad practice to keep all caches, including those that
belong to offline cgroups, in this array, because it will be growing
beyond any bounds then.  I'm going to wipe away dead caches from it to
save space.  To still be able to perform iterations over all memcg caches
of the same kind, let us link them into a list.
