[media] media: ti-vpe: use vb2_ops_wait_prepare/finish helper

This patch drops driver specific wait_prepare() and
wait_finish() callbacks from vb2_ops and instead uses
the the helpers vb2_ops_wait_prepare/finish() provided
by the vb2 core, the lock member of the queue needs
to be initalized to a mutex so that vb2 helpers
vb2_ops_wait_prepare/finish() can make use of it.
