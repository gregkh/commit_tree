rcu: Make _batches_completed() functions return unsigned long

Long ago, the various ->completed fields were of type long, but now are
unsigned long due to signed-integer-overflow concerns.  However, the
various _batches_completed() functions remained of type long, even though
their only purpose in life is to return the corresponding ->completed
field.  This patch cleans this up by changing these functions' return
types to unsigned long.
