Bluetooth: Introduce force_bredr_smp debugfs option for testing

Testing cross-transport pairing that starts on BR/EDR is only valid when
using a controller with BR/EDR Secure Connections. Devices will indicate
this by providing BR/EDR SMP fixed channel over L2CAP. To allow testing
of this feature on Bluetooth 4.0 controller or controllers without the
BR/EDR Secure Connections features, introduce a force_bredr_smp debugfs
option that allows faking the required AES connection.
