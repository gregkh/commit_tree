ALSA: Simplify snd_device_register() variants

Now that all callers have been replaced with
snd_device_register_for_dev(), let's drop the obsolete device
registration code and concentrate only on the code handling struct
device directly.  That said,

- remove the old snd_device_register(),
- rename snd_device_register_for_dev() with snd_device_register(),
- drop superfluous arguments from snd_device_register(),
- change snd_unregister_device() to pass the device pointer directly
