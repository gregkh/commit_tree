NFSD: restore trace event lost in mismerge

31ef83dc05 "nfsd: add trace events" had a typo that dropped a trace
event and replaced it by an incorrect recursive call to
nfsd4_cb_layout_fail.  133d558216d9 "Subject: nfsd: don't recursively
call nfsd4_cb_layout_fail" fixed the crash, this restores the
tracepoint.
