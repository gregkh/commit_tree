drm: Drop superfluous "select VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING"

commit 765d5b9c2b72f5b9 ("fbdev: fbcon: select VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING")
made FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE always select VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING, but forgot
to remove

	select VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING if FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE

from the individual drivers' sections that already did this before.

Remove it, also from new drivers.
