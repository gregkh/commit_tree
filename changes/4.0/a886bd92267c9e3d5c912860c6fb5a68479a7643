usb: common: otg-fsm: only signal connect after switching to peripheral

We should signal connect (pull up dp) after we have already
at peripheral mode, otherwise, the dp may be toggled due to
we reset controller or do disconnect during the initialization
for peripheral, then, the host may be confused during the
enumeration, eg, it finds the reset can't succeed, but the
device is still there, see below error message.
