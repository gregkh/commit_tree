lib/sort.c: use simpler includes

sort.c doesn't use facilities from kernel.h, but does use some types
defined in linux/types.h.  Include the latter directly instead of relying
on some other header doing it.  Similarly, include linux/export.h directly
instead of through module.h.  This removes 80 lines from the dependency
file .sort.o.cmd.
