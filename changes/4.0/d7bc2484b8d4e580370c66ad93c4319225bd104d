f2fs: fix small discards not to issue redundantly

The ckpt_valid_map and cur_valid_map are synced by seg_info_to_raw_sit.

In the case of small discards, the candidates are selected before sync,
while fitrim selects candidates after sync.

So, for small discards, we need to add candidates only just being obsoleted.
