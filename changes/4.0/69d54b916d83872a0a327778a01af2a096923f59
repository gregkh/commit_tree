kprobes: makes kprobes/enabled works correctly for optimized kprobes.

debugfs/kprobes/enabled doesn't work correctly on optimized kprobes.
Masami Hiramatsu has a test report on x86_64 platform:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/19/274

This patch forces it to unoptimize kprobe if kprobes_all_disarmed is set.
It also checks the flag in unregistering path for skipping unneeded
disarming process when kprobes globally disarmed.
