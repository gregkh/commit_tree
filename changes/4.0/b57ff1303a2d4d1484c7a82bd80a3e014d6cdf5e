pnfs: pass ds_commit_idx through the commit path

Pass ds_commit_idx through the nfs commit path. It's used to select
the commit bucket when using pnfs and is ignored when not using pnfs.
Several functions had to be changed: nfs_retry_commit,
nfs_mark_request_commit, pnfs_mark_request_commit and the pnfs layout
driver .mark_request_commit functions.
