net/mlx4_core: Manage interface state for Reset flow cases

We need to manage interface state to sync between reset flow and some other
relative cases such as remove_one. This has to be done to prevent certain
races. For example in case software stack is down as a result of unload call,
the remove_one should skip the unload phase.

Implement the remove_one case, handling AER and other cases comes next.

The interface can be up/down, upon remove_one, the state will include an extra
bit indicating that the device is cleaned-up, forcing other tasks to finish
before the final cleanup.
