HID: logitech-hidpp: detect HID++ 2.0 errors too

Devices speaking HID++ 2.0 report a different error code (0xff). Detect
these errors too to avoid 5 second delays when the device reports an
error. Caught by... well, a bug in the QEMU emulation of this receiver.

Renamed fap to rap for HID++ 1.0 errors because it is more logical,
it has no functional difference.
