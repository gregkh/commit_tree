dmaengine: Introduce a device_config callback

The fact that the channel configuration is done in device_control is rather
misleading, since it's not really advertised as such, plus, the fact that the
framework exposes a function of its own makes it not really intuitive, while
we're losing the type checking whenever we pass that unsigned long argument.

Add a device_config callback to dma_device, with a fallback on the old
behaviour for now for existing drivers to opt in.
