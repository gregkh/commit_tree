KVM: x86: Change parameter of kvm_mmu_slot_remove_write_access

This patch changes the second parameter of kvm_mmu_slot_remove_write_access from
'slot id' to 'struct kvm_memory_slot *' to align with kvm_x86_ops dirty logging
hooks, which will be introduced in further patch.

Better way is to change second parameter of kvm_arch_commit_memory_region from
'struct kvm_userspace_memory_region *' to 'struct kvm_memory_slot * new', but it
requires changes on other non-x86 ARCH too, so avoid it now.
