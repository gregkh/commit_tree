btrfs: more superblock checks, lower bounds on devices and sectorsize/nodesize

I received a few crafted images from Jiri, all got through the recently
added superblock checks. The lower bounds checks for num_devices and
sector/node -sizes were missing and caused a crash during mount.

Tools for symbolic code execution were used to prepare the images
contents.
