drm/amdkfd: Fix SDMA queue init. in non-HWS mode

This patch fixes the SDMA queue initialization, when running in non-HWS mode.

The first fix is to move the initialization of SDMA VM parameters before the
initialization of the SDMA MQD.

The second fix is to load the MQD to an HQD after the initialization of the MQD.
