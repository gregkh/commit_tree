tty/serial: 8250_early: Add support for PXA UARTs

The PXA variant of the 8250 UART adds a UART enable bit which must not
be cleared. Make the earlycon support maintain this bit if it is set.
This implies some initialization of the UART, but we cannot
unconditionally set the bit as some other variants require this bit to
be clear for other functions.
