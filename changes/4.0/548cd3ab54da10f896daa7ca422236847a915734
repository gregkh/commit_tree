mtd: spi-nor: Add quad I/O support for Micron SPI NOR

This patch adds code which enables Quad I/O mode on Micron SPI NOR flashes.

For Micron SPI NOR flash, enabling or disabling quad I/O protocol can be
done By two methods, which are to use EVCR (Enhanced Volatile
Configuration Register) and the ENTER QUAD I/O MODE command. There is no
difference between these two methods. Unfortunately, for some Micron SPI
NOR flashes, there no ENTER Quad I/O command (35h), such as n25q064. But
for all current Micron SPI NOR, if it support quad I/O mode, using EVCR
definitely be supported. It is a recommended method to enable Quad I/O
mode by EVCR, Quad I/O protocol bit 7. When EVCR bit 7 is reset to 0,
the SPI NOR flash will operate in quad I/O mode.

This patch has been tested on N25Q512A and MT25TL256BAA1ESF. Micron SPI
NOR of spi_nor_ids[] table all support this method.
