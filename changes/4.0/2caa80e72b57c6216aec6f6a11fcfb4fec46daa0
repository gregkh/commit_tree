    drm: tweak getconnector locking

We need to extend the locking to cover connector->state reading for
atomic drivers, but the above commit was a bit too eager and also
included the fill_modes callback. Which on i915 on old platforms using
load detection needs to acquire modeset locks, resulting in a deadlock
on output probing.
