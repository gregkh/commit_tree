PCI: spear: Drop __initdata from spear13xx_pcie_driver

Struct spear13xx_pcie_driver was in initdata, but we passed a pointer to it
to platform_driver_register(), which can use the pointer at arbitrary times
in the future, even after the initdata is freed.  That leads to crashes.

Move spear13xx_pcie_driver and things referenced by it
(spear13xx_pcie_probe() and dw_pcie_host_init()) out of initdata.
