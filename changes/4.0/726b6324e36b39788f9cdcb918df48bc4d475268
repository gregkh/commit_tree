mmc: pwrseq: add driver for emmc hardware reset

This patch provides a simple mmc-pwrseq-emmc driver, which controls
single gpio line. It perform standard eMMC hw reset procedure, as
descibed by Jedec 4.4 specification. This procedure is performed just
after MMC core enabled power to the given mmc host (to fix possible
issues if bootloader has left eMMC card in initialized or unknown
state), and before performing complete system reboot (also in case of
emergency reboot call). The latter is needed on boards, which doesn't
have hardware reset logic connected to emmc card and (limited or broken)
ROM bootloaders are unable to read second stage from the emmc card if
the card is left in unknown or already initialized state.
