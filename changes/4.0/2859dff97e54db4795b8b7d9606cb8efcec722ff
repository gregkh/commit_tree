efi: Expose underlying UEFI firmware platform size to userland

In some cases (e.g. Intel Bay Trail machines), the kernel will happily
run in 64-bit even if the underlying UEFI firmware platform is
32-bit. That's great, but it's difficult for userland utilities like
grub-install to do the right thing in such a situation.

The kernel already knows about the size of the firmware via
efi_enabled(EFI_64BIT). Add an extra sysfs interface
/sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size to expose that information to
userland for low-level utilities to use.
