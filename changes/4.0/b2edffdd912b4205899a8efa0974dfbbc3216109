fix mremap() vs. ioctx_kill() race

teach ->mremap() method to return an error and have it fail for
aio mappings in process of being killed

Note that in case of ->mremap() failure we need to undo move_page_tables()
we'd already done; we could call ->mremap() first, but then the failure of
move_page_tables() would require undoing whatever _successful_ ->mremap()
has done, which would be a lot more headache in general.
