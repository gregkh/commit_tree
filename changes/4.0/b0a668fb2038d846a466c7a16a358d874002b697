MIPS: kernel: mips-r2-to-r6-emul: Add R2 emulator for MIPS R6

MIPS R6 removed quite a few R2 instructions. However, there
is plenty of <R6 userland code so we add an in-kernel emulator
so we can still be able to execute all R2 userland out there.

The emulator comes with a handy debugfs under /mips/ directory
(r2-emul-stats) to provide some basic statistics of the
instructions that are being emulated.

Below are some statistics from booting a minimal buildroot image:
