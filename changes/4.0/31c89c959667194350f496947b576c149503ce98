pinctrl: pinconf-generic: Infer map type from DT property

With the new 'groups' property, the DT parser can infer the map type
from the fact whether 'pins' or 'groups' is used to specify the pin
group to work on.

To maintain backwards compatibitliy with current usage of the DT
binding, this is only done when PIN_MAP_TYPE_INVALID is passed to the
parsing function as type.

Also, a new helper 'pinconf_generic_dt_node_to_map_all()' is introduced,
which can be used by drivers as generic callback for dt_node_to_map() to
leverage the new feature.

Changes since v2:
 - rename dt_pin_specifier to subnode_target_type
 - add additional comment in header file explaining passing an invalid
   map type
 - mention map_all() helper in commit message
Changes since RFC v2:
 - none
