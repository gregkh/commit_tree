net: remove sock_iocb

The sock_iocb structure is allocate on stack for each read/write-like
operation on sockets, and contains various fields of which only the
embedded msghdr and sometimes a pointer to the scm_cookie is ever used.
Get rid of the sock_iocb and put a msghdr directly on the stack and pass
the scm_cookie explicitly to netlink_mmap_sendmsg.
