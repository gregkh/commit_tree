kprobes: set kprobes_all_disarmed earlier to enable re-optimization.

In original code, the probed instruction doesn't get optimized after

echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/enabled
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/enabled

This is because original code checks kprobes_all_disarmed in
optimize_kprobe(), but this flag is turned off after calling that
function.  Therefore, optimize_kprobe() will see kprobes_all_disarmed ==
true and doesn't do the optimization.

This patch simply turns off kprobes_all_disarmed earlier to enable
optimization.
