firewire: core: use correct vendor/model IDs

The kernel was using the vendor ID 0xd00d1e, which was inherited from
the old ieee1394 driver stack.  However, this ID was not registered, and
invalid.

Instead, use the vendor/model IDs that are now officially assigned to
the kernel:
https://ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/IEEE_OUI_Assignments

[stefanr:
  - The vendor ID 001f11 is Openmoko, Inc.'s identifier, registered at
    IEEE Registration Authority.
  - The range of model IDs 023900...0239ff are the Linux kernel 1394
    subsystem's identifiers, registered at Openmoko.
  - Model ID 023901 is picked by the subsystem developers as
    firewire-core's model ID.]
