staging: Remove the Android logger driver

With the relase of Lollipop, Android no longer
requires the logger driver.

There are three patches which the android dev's
still need before they drop logger on all their
devices:

[PATCH v4 1/5] pstores: use scnprintf
[PATCH v2 2/5] pstore: remove superfluous memory size check
[PATCH 3/5] pstore: handle zero-sized prz in series
[PATCH v4 4/5] pstore: add pmsg
[PATCH 5/5] pstore: selinux: add security in-core xattr support for pstore and debugfs

But these seem to have been acked and are hopefully
queued for upstream.

So this patch removes the logger driver from staging.
