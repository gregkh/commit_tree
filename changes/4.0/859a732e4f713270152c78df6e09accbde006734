iommu/arm-smmu: add support for iova_to_phys through ATS1PR

Currently, we provide the iommu_ops.iova_to_phys service by doing a
table walk in software to translate IO virtual addresses to physical
addresses. On SMMUs that support it, it can be useful to ask the SMMU
itself to do the translation. This can be used to warm the TLBs for an
SMMU. It can also be useful for testing and hardware validation.

Since the address translation registers are optional on SMMUv2, only
enable hardware translations when using SMMUv1 or when SMMU_IDR0.S1TS=1
and SMMU_IDR0.ATOSNS=0, as described in the ARM SMMU v1-v2 spec.
