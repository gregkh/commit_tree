drm/i915: Convert 'trace_irq' to use requests rather than seqnos

Updated the trace_irq code to use requests instead of seqnos. This includes
reference counting the request object to ensure it sticks around when required.
Note that getting access to the reference counting functions means moving the
inline i915_trace_irq_get() function from intel_ringbuffer.h to i915_drv.h.
