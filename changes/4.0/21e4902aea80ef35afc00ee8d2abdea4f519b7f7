netlink: Lockless lookup with RCU grace period in socket release

Defers the release of the socket reference using call_rcu() to
allow using an RCU read-side protected call to rhashtable_lookup()

This restores behaviour and performance gains as previously
introduced by e341694 ("netlink: Convert netlink_lookup() to use
RCU protected hash table") without the side effect of severely
delayed socket destruction.
