HID: wacom: check for wacom->shared before following the pointer

486b908 (HID: wacom: do not send pen events before touch is up/forced out)
introduces a kernel oops when plugging a tablet without touch.

wacom->shared is null for these devices so this leads to a null pointer
exception.

Change the condition to make it clear that what we need is wacom->shared
not NULL.
