arm/arm64: KVM: refactor MMIO accessors

The MMIO accessors for GICD_I[CS]ENABLER, GICD_I[CS]PENDR and
GICD_ICFGR behave very similar for GICv2 and GICv3, although the way
the affected VCPU is determined differs.
Since we need them to access the registers from three different
places in the future, we factor out a generic, backend-facing
implementation and use small wrappers in the current GICv2 emulation.
This will ease adding GICv3 accessors later.
