staging: comedi: vm80xx: rewrite comedi driver comment block

Rewrite the comedi "driver" comment block to conform to the usual format
for comedi driver comment blocks and reformat it to use the usual block
comment style.  In particular, the "Devices:" line should be a
comma-separated list where the first item is in the following format:

  [Manufacturer] BOARD-NAME (comedi-board-name)

The "[Manufacturer]" and/or "(comedi-board-name)" parts may be omitted
from following items, in which case the parts from the preceding item
are used.  The "Devices:" line may be continued continued over several
lines by using one or more spaces at the start of each continuation line
(not counting the space after the "*" in the block comment).

Note that the comedi board names I've added to the "Devices:" line don't
quite match the board names reported by the driver itself, as they
contain parentheses and I don't want nested parentheses on the
"Devices:" line (mostly because it confuses a script I use to extract
supported devices from the driver comments).
