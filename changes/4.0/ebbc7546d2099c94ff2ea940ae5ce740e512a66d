drm/i915: Take runtime pm reference on hangcheck_info

We read the coherent current seqno and actual head from ring.
For hardware access we need to take runtime_pm reference.

Get hardware specific values with runtime reference held
and print them first to emphasize hw state vs bookkeepping.

v2: Reorder output according to hw access (Chris)
    remove superfluous locking (Daniel)
