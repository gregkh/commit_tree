    inet: Add ip_make_skb and ip_finish_skb

It adds IPv6 version of the helpers ip6_make_skb and ip6_finish_skb.

The job of ip6_make_skb is to collect messages into an ipv6 packet
and poplulate ipv6 eader.  The job of ip6_finish_skb is to transmit
the generated skb.  Together they replicated the job of
ip6_push_pending_frames() while also provide the capability to be
called independently.  This will be needed to add lockless UDP sendmsg
support.
