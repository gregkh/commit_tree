ARM: qcom: Drop unnecessary selects from ARCH_QCOM

We don't need to force gpiolib on everyone given that it isn't
required to actually boot the device and the multiplatform
Kconfig already selects ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB. CLKSRC_OF is
already selected by CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM too, so we can drop
that here.
