i2o: move to staging

The I2O layer deals with a technology that to say the least didn't catch on
in the market.

The only relevant products are some of the AMI MegaRAID - which supported I2O
and its native mode (The native mode is faster and runs on Linux), an
obscure crypto ethernet card that's now so many years out of date nobody
would use it, the old DPT controllers, which speak their own dialect and
have their own driver - and ermm.. thats about it.

We also know the code isn't in good shape as recently a patch was proposed
and queried as buggy, which in turn showed the existing code was broken
already by prior "clean up" and nobody had noticed that either.

It's coding style robot code nothing more. Like some forgotten corridor
cleaned relentlessly by a lost Roomba but where no user has trodden in years.

Move it to staging and then to /dev/null.

The headers remain as they are shared with dpt_i2o.
