arm64: KVM: add SGI generation register emulation

While the generation of a (virtual) inter-processor interrupt (SGI)
on a GICv2 works by writing to a MMIO register, GICv3 uses the system
register ICC_SGI1R_EL1 to trigger them.
Add a trap handler function that calls the new SGI register handler
in the GICv3 code. As ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE at this point is still always 0,
this will not trap yet, but will only be used later when all the data
structures have been initialized properly.
