Btrfs: fix off-by-one logic error in btrfs_realloc_node

The end_slot variable actually matches the number of pointers in the
node and not the last slot (which is 'nritems - 1'). Therefore in order
to check that the current slot in the for loop doesn't match the last
one, the correct logic is to check if 'i' is less than 'end_slot - 1'
and not 'end_slot - 2'.

Fix this and set end_slot to be 'nritems - 1', as it's less confusing
since the variable name implies it's inclusive rather then exclusive.
