sched/rt: Reduce rq lock contention by eliminating locking of non-feasible target

This patch adds checks that prevens futile attempts to move rt tasks
to a CPU with active tasks of equal or higher priority.

This reduces run queue lock contention and improves the performance of
a well known OLTP benchmark by 0.7%.
