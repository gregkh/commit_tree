ARM: dts: am335x-bone-common: enable aes and sham

Beaglebone Black doesn't have AES and SHAM enabled like the
original Beaglebone White dts. This breaks applications that
leverage the crypto blocks so fix this by enabling these nodes
in the am335x-bone-common.dtsi. With this change, enabling the
nodes in am335x-bone.dts is no longer required so remove them.
