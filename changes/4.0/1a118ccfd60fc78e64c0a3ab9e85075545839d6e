f2fs: use spinlock for segmap_lock instead of rwlock

rwlock can provide better concurrency when there are much more readers than
writers because readers can hold the rwlock simultaneously.

But now, for segmap_lock rwlock in struct free_segmap_info, there is only one
reader 'mount' from below call path:
->f2fs_fill_super
  ->build_segment_manager
    ->build_dirty_segmap
      ->init_dirty_segmap
        ->find_next_inuse
          read_lock
          ...
          read_unlock

Now that our concurrency can not be improved since there is no other reader for
this lock, we do not need to use rwlock_t type for segmap_lock, let's replace it
with spinlock_t type.
