ARM: OMAP2+: Add clock domain support for dm816x

This patch adds required definitions and structures for clockdomain
initialization, so omap3xxx_clockdomains_init() was substituted by
new ti81xx_clockdomains_init() while early initialization of
TI81XX platform.

Note that we now need to have 81xx in a separate CONFIG_SOC_TI81XX
block instead inside the ifdef block for omap3 to avoid make
randconfig build errors.

This code is based on the TI81XX-LINUX-PSP-04.04.00.02 patches
