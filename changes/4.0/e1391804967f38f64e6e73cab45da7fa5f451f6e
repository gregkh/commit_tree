ARM: dts: sun6i: hummingbird: Add ethernet phy reset gpio properties

On the Hummingbird A31 board, the RTL8211E ethernet phy has its reset
line connect to a gpio pin, instead of floating like on other boards.
Add the stmmac properties for describing the reset gpio.

The reset delays were taken from the RTL8211E datasheet.
