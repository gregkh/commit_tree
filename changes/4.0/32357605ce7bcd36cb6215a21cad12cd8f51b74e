USB: Add missing word to comment in mod_devicetable.h

The documentation of match_flags in struct usb_device_id said:
'Bit mask controlling of the other fields are used to match against new devices.'
Changed to:
'Bit mask controlling which of the other fields are used to match against new devices.'
By adding the word 'which' and editing the next lines to not exceed 80 chars.
