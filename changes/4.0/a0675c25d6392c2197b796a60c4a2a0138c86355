arm/arm64: KVM: add virtual GICv3 distributor emulation

With everything separated and prepared, we implement a model of a
GICv3 distributor and redistributors by using the existing framework
to provide handler functions for each register group.

Currently we limit the emulation to a model enforcing a single
security state, with SRE==1 (forcing system register access) and
ARE==1 (allowing more than 8 VCPUs).

We share some of the functions provided for GICv2 emulation, but take
the different ways of addressing (v)CPUs into account.
Save and restore is currently not implemented.

Similar to the split-off of the GICv2 specific code, the new emulation
code goes into a new file (vgic-v3-emul.c).
