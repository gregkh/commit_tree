ipv6: tcp: fix race in IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS

IPv6 TCP sockets store in np->pktoptions skbs, and use skb_set_owner_r()
to charge the skb to socket.

It means that destructor must be called while socket is locked.

Therefore, we cannot use skb_get() or atomic_inc(&skb->users)
to protect ourselves : kfree_skb() might race with other users
manipulating sk->sk_forward_alloc

Fix this race by holding socket lock for the duration of
ip6_datagram_recv_ctl()
