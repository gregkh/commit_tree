ftrace: let notrace function attribute disable hotpatching if necessary

gcc supports an s390 specific function attribute called "hotpatch".
It can be used to specify the number of halfwords that shall be added before
and after a function and which shall be filled with nops for runtime patching.

s390 will use the hotpatch attribute for function tracing, therefore make
sure that the notrace function attribute either disables the mcount call
or in case of hotpatch nop generation.
