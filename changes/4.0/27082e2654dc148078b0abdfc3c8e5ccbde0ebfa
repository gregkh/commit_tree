xhci: Clear the host side toggle manually when endpoint is 'soft reset'

Main benefit of this is to get xhci connected USB scanners to work.

Some devices use a clear endpoint halt request as a 'soft reset' even if
the endpoint is not halted. This will clear the toggle and sequence on the
device side. xHCI however refuses to reset a non-halted endpoint, so instead
we need to issue a configure endpoint command on xHCI to clear its host side
toggle and sequence, and get it in sync with the device side.
