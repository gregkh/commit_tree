pagemap: use walk->vma instead of calling find_vma()

Page table walker has the information of the current vma in mm_walk, so we
don't have to call find_vma() in each pagemap_(pte|hugetlb)_range() call
any longer.  Currently pagemap_pte_range() does vma loop itself, so this
patch reduces many lines of code.

NULL-vma check is omitted because we assume that we never run these
callbacks on any address outside vma.  And even if it were broken, NULL
pointer dereference would be detected, so we can get enough information
for debugging.
