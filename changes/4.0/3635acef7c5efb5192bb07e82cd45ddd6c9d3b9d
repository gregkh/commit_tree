ARM: dts: Exynos4 and Odroid X2/U3 sound device nodes update

Clock related properties are added to the Exynos4 I2S device nodes
so they can be referred to as clock providers. Missing i2s_opclk1
clock is added to the I2S0 node and clock properties are added
to the MAX98090 codec node to allow it to control/read frequency
of the MCLK clock directly.
