ARM: brcmstb: update CPU power management sequence

The automatic CPU power state machine for B15 CPUs does not work
reliably as-is. This patch implements a manual sequence in software to
replace it.

This was tested successfully with over 10,000 hotplug cycles of
something like this:

  echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
  echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

whereas the existing sequence often locks up after a few hundred cycles.
