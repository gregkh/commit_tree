mm/zpool: add name argument to create zpool

Currently the underlay of zpool: zsmalloc/zbud, do not know who creates
them.  There is not a method to let zsmalloc/zbud find which caller they
belong to.

Now we want to add statistics collection in zsmalloc.  We need to name the
debugfs dir for each pool created.  The way suggested by Minchan Kim is to
use a name passed by caller(such as zram) to create the zsmalloc pool.

    /sys/kernel/debug/zsmalloc/zram0

This patch adds an argument `name' to zs_create_pool() and other related
functions.
