PNP: Allow console to override ACPI device sleep

If the serial console is an ACPI PNP device, the PNP bus always powers
down the device at system suspend, even though the no_console_suspend
command line parameter is specified (eg., when debugging suspend/resume).

Add PNP_CONSOLE capability, which when set, prevents calling both the
->disable() and ->suspend() PNP protocol methods if console suspend
is disabled.
