drm/i915: Move golden context init into ->init_context

Similar to a patch from Thomas Daniel for lrc contexts. This keeps
both sides somewhat in sync and should make Dave Gordon happy.

Note that both the wa and the golden context init code suffer a bit
from an inssuficient split into driver load and hw init code. Which
means we have a bunch of tests all over the place to check whether the
one-time initialization has been done already or not.

All that one-tim code should be moved into the one-time ring setup
code, but that's work for later.
