ocfs2: _really_ sync the right range

"ocfs2 syncs the wrong range" had been broken; prior to it the
code was doing the wrong thing in case of O_APPEND, all right,
but _after_ it we were syncing the wrong range in 100% cases.
*ppos, aka iocb->ki_pos is incremented prior to that point,
so we are always doing sync on the area _after_ the one we'd
written to.

unfortunately, I'd missed his mail back then ;-/
