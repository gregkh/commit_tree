rbd: convert to blk-mq

This converts the rbd driver to use the blk-mq infrastructure.  Except
for switching to a per-request work item this is almost mechanical.

This was tested by Alexandre DERUMIER in November, and found to give
him 120000 iops, although the only comparism available was an old
3.10 kernel which gave 80000iops.
