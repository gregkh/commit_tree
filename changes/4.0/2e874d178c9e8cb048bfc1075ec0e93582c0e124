m68k/mac: Fix scsi_type for Mac LC and similar models

Designing Cards and Drivers for the Macintosh Family, 3rd ed. on page 310
says that the I/O address space for the Mac LC is $50F0 0000 - $50FF FFFF.
The developer notes for the Classic II, LC III and IIvx/IIvi give the same
I/O address space.

That means I've assigned the wrong platform resources to those Mac models.
Fix the scsi_type initialization for the affected models, to restore the
SCSI base address to its value prior to Linux 3.18.

Also rename MAC_SCSI_CCL as MAC_SCSI_LC for the sake of correct chronology.
