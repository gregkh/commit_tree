uprobes/x86: Fix 1-byte opcode tables

This change fixes 1-byte opcode tables so that only insns
for which we have real reasons to disallow probing are marked
with unset bits.

To that end:

Set bits for all prefix bytes. Their setting is ignored anyway -
we check the bitmap against OPCODE1(insn), not against first
byte. Keeping them set to 0 only confuses code reader with
"why we don't support that opcode" question.

Thus: enable bytes c4,c5 in 64-bit mode (VEX prefixes).
Byte 62 (EVEX prefix) is not yet enabled since insn decoder
does not support that yet.

For 32-bit mode, enable probing of opcodes 63 (arpl) and d6
(salc). They don't require any special handling.

For 64-bit mode, disable 9a and ea - these undefined opcodes
were mistakenly left enabled.
