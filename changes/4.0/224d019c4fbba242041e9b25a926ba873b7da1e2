ip: Move checksum convert defines to inet

Move convert_csum from udp_sock to inet_sock. This allows the
possibility that we can use convert checksum for different types
of sockets and also allows convert checksum to be enabled from
inet layer (what we'll want to do when enabling IP_CHECKSUM cmsg).
