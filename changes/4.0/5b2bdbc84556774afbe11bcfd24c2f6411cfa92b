x86: Init per-cpu shadow copy of CR4 on 32-bit CPUs too

Commit:

   1e02ce4cccdc ("x86: Store a per-cpu shadow copy of CR4")

added a shadow CR4 such that reads and writes that do not
modify the CR4 execute much faster than always reading the
register itself.

The change modified cpu_init() in common.c, so that the
shadow CR4 gets initialized before anything uses it.

Unfortunately, there's two cpu_init()s in common.c. There's
one for 64-bit and one for 32-bit. The commit only added
the shadow init to the 64-bit path, but the 32-bit path
needs the init too.
