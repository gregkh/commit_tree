serial: imx: remove unneeded imx_transmit_buffer() from imx_start_tx()

Use imx_start_tx() just to enable the TX interrupt. It's the job of the
TX interrupt ISR to fill the transmit buffer, then. If the transmit buffer
is empty, the TX interrupt should be executed as soon as the start_tx()
enables the interrupt, so there is no reason for the extra
imx_transmit_buffer() call, here. Remove it.
