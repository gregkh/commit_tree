Btrfs: Include map_type in raid_bio

Corrent code use many kinds of "clever" way to determine operation
target's raid type, as:
  raid_map != NULL
  or
  raid_map[MAX_NR] == RAID[56]_Q_STRIPE

To make code easy to maintenance, this patch put raid type into
bbio, and we can always get raid type from bbio with a "stupid"
way.
