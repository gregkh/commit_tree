be2net: Prevent VFs from enabling VLAN promiscuous mode

Currently, a PF does not restrict its VF interface from enabling vlan
promiscuous mode. This breaks vlan isolation when a vlan
(transparent tagging) is configured on a VF.

This patch fixes this problem by disabling the vlan promisc capability
for VFs.
