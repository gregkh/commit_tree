net: openvswitch: Support masked set actions.

OVS userspace already probes the openvswitch kernel module for
OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SET_MASKED support.  This patch adds the kernel module
implementation of masked set actions.

The existing set action sets many fields at once.  When only a subset
of the IP header fields, for example, should be modified, all the IP
fields need to be exact matched so that the other field values can be
copied to the set action.  A masked set action allows modification of
an arbitrary subset of the supported header bits without requiring the
rest to be matched.

Masked set action is now supported for all writeable key types, except
for the tunnel key.  The set tunnel action is an exception as any
input tunnel info is cleared before action processing starts, so there
is no tunnel info to mask.

The kernel module converts all (non-tunnel) set actions to masked set
actions.  This makes action processing more uniform, and results in
less branching and duplicating the action processing code.  When
returning actions to userspace, the fully masked set actions are
converted back to normal set actions.  We use a kernel internal action
code to be able to tell the userspace provided and converted masked
set actions apart.
