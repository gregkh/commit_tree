i40evf: refactor shutdown code

If the VF driver is running in the host, the shutdown code is completely
broken. We cannot wait in our down routine for the PF to respond to our
requests, as its admin queue task will never run while we hold the lock.

Instead, we schedule operations, then let the watchdog take care of
shutting things down. If the driver is being removed, then wait in the
remove routine until the watchdog is done before continuing.
