macvtap: make sure neighbour code can push ethernet header

Brian reported crashes using IPv6 traffic with macvtap/veth combo.

I tracked the crashes in neigh_hh_output()

-> memcpy(skb->data - HH_DATA_MOD, hh->hh_data, HH_DATA_MOD);

Neighbour code assumes headroom to push Ethernet header is
at least 16 bytes.

It appears macvtap has only 14 bytes available on arches
where NET_IP_ALIGN is 0 (like x86)

Effect is a corruption of 2 bytes right before skb->head,
and possible crashes if accessing non existing memory.

This fix should also increase IPv4 performance, as paranoid code
in ip_finish_output2() wont have to call skb_realloc_headroom()
