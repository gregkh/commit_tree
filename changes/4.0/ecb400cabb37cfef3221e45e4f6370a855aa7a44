ASoC: samsung: odroidx2: Handle I2S CDCLK clock conditionally

In order to support old DTs we check the codec device node if it
contains "clocks" property and only if it doesn't (which indicates
an old DT) we proceed with enabling the CDCLK clock by means of
the set_sysclk() callback.  For new DTs which use the common clock
bindings for CDCLK that clock is supposed to be handled outside
the sound machine driver.
