target: Add sanity checks for DPO/FUA bit usage

This patch adds a sbc_check_dpofua() function that performs sanity
checks for DPO/FUA command bits.

It introduces checks to fail when either bit is set, but the backend
device is not advertising support for them.

It also moves the existing cmd->se_cmd_flags |= SCF_FUA assignement
into the new helper function.
