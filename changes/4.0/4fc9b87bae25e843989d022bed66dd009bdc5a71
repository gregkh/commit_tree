net: fs_enet: Implement NETIF_F_SG feature

Freescale ethernet controllers have the capability to re-assemble fragmented
data into a single ethernet frame. This patch uses this capability and
implements NETIP_F_SG feature into the fs_enet ethernet driver.

On a MPC885, I get 53% performance improvement on a ftp transfer of a 15Mb file:
  * Without the patch : 2,8 Mbps
  * With the patch : 4,3 Mbps
