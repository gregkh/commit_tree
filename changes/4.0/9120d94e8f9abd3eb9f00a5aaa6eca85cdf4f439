mac80211: handle potential race between suspend and scan completion

If suspend starts while ieee80211_scan_completed() is running, between
the point where SCAN_COMPLETED is set and the work is queued,
ieee80211_scan_cancel() will not catch the work and we may finish
suspending before the work is actually executed, leaving the scan
running while suspended.

To fix this race, queue the scan work during resume if the
SCAN_COMPLETED flag is set and flush it immediately.
