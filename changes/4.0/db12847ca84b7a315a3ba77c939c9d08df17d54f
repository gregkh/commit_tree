mac80211: Re-fix accounting of the tailroom-needed counter

When hw acceleration is enabled, the GENERATE_IV or PUT_IV_SPACE flags
only require headroom space. Therefore, the tailroom-needed counter can
safely be decremented for most drivers.

The older incarnation of this patch (ca34e3b5) assumed that the above
holds true for all drivers. As reported by Christopher Chavez and
researched by Christian Lamparter and Larry Finger, this isn't a valid
assumption for p54 and cw1200.

Drivers that still require tailroom for ICV/MIC even when HW encryption
is enabled can use IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_RESERVE_TAILROOM to indicate it.
