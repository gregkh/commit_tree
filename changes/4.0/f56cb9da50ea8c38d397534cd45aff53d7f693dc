drivers: staging: lustre: Track sign separately

The `mult' parameter is negated if the user data begins with a '-' so
that the final value has the appropriate sign.  But `mult' is only used
if the user data does not include a "units" suffix.  In this case,
`mult' is overridden with the numeric scale conveyed by the units suffix,
but retains the sign of the original value.

Having `mult' serving double-duty works but is confusing.  Use a new
local variable to store the sign of the user data instead.  This also
fixes a pitfall of passing 0 to `mult', expecting it to be ignored when
a units suffix is specified, but having the effect of taking the
absolute value of the user-provided data.
