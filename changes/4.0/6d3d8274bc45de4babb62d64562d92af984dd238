in to the associated request.

Issue: VIZ-4274

v2: Rebase. Fixed issue of overzealous freeing of request.
v3: Removed re-addition of cleanup work queue (found by Daniel Vetter)
v4: Rebase.
v5: Actual removal of intel_ctx_submit_request. Update both tail and postfix
pointer in __i915_add_request (found by Thomas Daniel)
v6: Removed unrelated changes
