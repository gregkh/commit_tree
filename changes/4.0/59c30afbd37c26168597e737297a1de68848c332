Input: alps - report interleaved bare PS/2 packets via dev3

Bare packets should be reported via the same evdev device independent on
whether they are detected on the beginning of a packet or in the middle
of a packet.

This has been tested on a Dell Latitude E6400, where the DualPoint Stick
reports bare packets, which get reported via dev3 when the touchpad is
idle, and via dev2 when the touchpad and stick are used simultaneously.

This commit fixes this inconsistency by always reporting bare packets via
dev3. Note that since the come from a DualPoint Stick they really should be
reported via dev2, this gets fixed in a later commit.
