USB: usbfs: allow URBs to be reaped after disconnection

The usbfs API has a peculiar hole: Users are not allowed to reap their
URBs after the device has been disconnected.  There doesn't seem to be
any good reason for this; it is an ad-hoc inconsistency.

The patch allows users to issue the USBDEVFS_REAPURB and
USBDEVFS_REAPURBNDELAY ioctls (together with their 32-bit counterparts
on 64-bit systems) even after the device is gone.  If no URBs are
pending for a disconnected device then the ioctls will return -ENODEV
rather than -EAGAIN, because obviously no new URBs will ever be able
to complete.

The patch also adds a new capability flag for
USBDEVFS_GET_CAPABILITIES to indicate that the reap-after-disconnect
feature is supported.
