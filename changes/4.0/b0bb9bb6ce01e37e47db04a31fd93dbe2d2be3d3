Revert "usb: dwc2: add bus suspend/resume for dwc2"

This reverts commit 0cf884e819e05437287a668b9bfcc198bab6329c.
Even after applying the follow-on patch at
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5325111
there are still problems with device connect on the Altera SOCFPGA
platform at least. One possible fix would be to add a whitelist
to enable suspend/resume on platforms where it does work correctly.
