powerpc/powernv: Don't alloc IRQ map if necessary

On PowerNV platform, the OPAL interrupts are exported by firmware
through device-node property (/ibm,opal::opal-interrupts). Under
some extreme circumstances (e.g. simulator), we don't have this
property found from the device tree. For that case, we shouldn't
allocate the interrupt map. Otherwise, slab complains allocating
zero sized memory chunk.
