ipv6: pull cork initialization into its own function.

Pull IPv6 cork initialization into its own function that
can be re-used.  IPv6 specific cork data did not have an
explicit data structure.  This patch creats eone so that
just ipv6 cork data can be as arguemts.  Also, since
IPv6 tries to save the flow label into inet_cork_full
tructure, pass the full cork.

Adjust ip6_cork_release() to take cork data structures.
