iio: mxs-lradc: separate touchscreen and buffer virtual channels

The touchscreen was initially designed [1] to map all of its physical
channels to one virtual channel, leaving buffered capture to use the
remaining 7 virtual channels. When the touchscreen was reimplemented
[2], it was made to use four virtual channels, which overlap and
conflict with the channels the buffer uses.

As a result, when the buffer is enabled, the touchscreen's virtual
channels are remapped to whichever physical channels the buffer was
configured with, causing the touchscreen to read those instead of the
touch measurement channels. Effectively the touchscreen stops working.

So here we separate the channels again, giving the touchscreen 2 virtual
channels and the buffer 6. We can't give the touchscreen just 1 channel
as before, as the current pressure calculation requires 2 channels to be
read at the same time.

This makes the touchscreen continue to work during buffered capture. It
has been tested on i.MX28, but not on i.MX23.
