Bluetooth: Allow remote OOB data to only provide P-192 or P-256 values

In case the remote only provided P-192 or P-256 data for OOB pairing,
then make sure that the data value pointers are correctly set. That way
the core can provide correct information when remote OOB data present
information have to be communicated.
