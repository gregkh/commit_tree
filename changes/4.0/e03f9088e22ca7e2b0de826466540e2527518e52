irqchip: renesas-intc-irqpin: r8a7779 IRLM setup support

Add r8a7779 specific support for IRLM bit configuration
in the INTC-IRQPIN driver. Without this code we need
special workaround code in arch/arm/mach-shmobile.

The IRLM bit for the INTC hardware exists on various
older SH-based SoCs and is used to select between two
modes for the external interrupt pins IRQ0 to IRQ3:

IRLM = 0: (default from reset on r8a7779)
In this mode the pins IRQ0 to IRQ3 are used together
to give a value between 0 and 15 to the SoC. External
logic is required for masking. This mode is not
supported by the INTC-IRQPIN driver.

IRLM = 1: (needs this patch or configuration elsewhere)
In this mode IRQ0 to IRQ3 operate as 4 individual
external interrupt pins. In this mode the SMSC ethernet
chip can be used via IRQ1 on r8a7779 Marzen. This mode
is the only supported mode by the INTC-IRQPIN driver.

For this patch to work the r8a7779 DTS needs to pass
the ICR0 register as the last register bank.
