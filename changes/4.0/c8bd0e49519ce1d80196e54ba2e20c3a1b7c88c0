    drm: Zero out DRM object memory upon cleanup

we will use the eDP encoder during destroying it. Fix this by calling
drm_encoder_cleanup() at a point when the encoder is not used any more.
This caused a NULL pointer dereference in pps_lock(), I can't see that
it caused any other problem.

All the other encoders seem to call drm_encoder_cleanup() at a safe
place.
