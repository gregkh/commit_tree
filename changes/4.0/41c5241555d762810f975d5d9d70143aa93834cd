drm/i915: Remove the now redundant 'obj->ring'

The ring member of the object structure was always updated with the
last_read_seqno member. Thus with the conversion to last_read_req, obj->ring is
now a direct copy of obj->last_read_req->ring. This makes it somewhat redundant
and potentially misleading (especially as there was no comment to explain its
purpose).

This checkin removes the redundant field. Many uses were simply testing for
non-null to see if the object is active on the GPU. Some of these have been
converted to check 'obj->active' instead. Others (where the last_read_req is
about to be used anyway) have been changed to check obj->last_read_req. The rest
simply pull the ring out from the request structure and proceed as before.
