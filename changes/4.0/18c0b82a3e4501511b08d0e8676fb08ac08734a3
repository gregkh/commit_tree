IB/qib: Do not write EEPROM

This changeset removes all the code that allows the driver to write to
the EEPROM and update the recorded error counters and power on hours.

These two stats are unused and writing them exposes a timing risk
which could leave the EEPROM in a bad state preventing further normal
operation of the HCA.
