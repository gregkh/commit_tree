x86/smpboot: Cleanup ioapic handling

smpboot is very creative with the ways to disable ioapic.

smpboot_clear_io_apic() smpboot_clear_io_apic_irqs() and
disable_ioapic_support() serve a similar purpose.

smpboot_clear_io_apic_irqs() is the most useless of all
functions as it clears a variable which has not been setup yet.

Aside of that it has the same ifdef mess and conditionals around the
ioapic related code, which can now be removed.
