Bluetooth: Add le_scan_restart work for LE scan restarting

Currently there is no way to restart le scan, and it's needed in
service scan method. The way it work: it disable, and then enable le
scan on controller.

During the restart, we must remember when the scan was started, and
it's duration, to later re-schedule the le_scan_disable work, that was
stopped during the stop scan phase.
