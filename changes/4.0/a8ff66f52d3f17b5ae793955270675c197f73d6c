MIPS: Emulate the new MIPS R6 B{L,G}Î•{Z,}{AL,}C instructions

MIPS R6 added the following four instructions which share the
BLEZ and BLEZL opcodes:

BLEZALC: Compact branch-and-link if GPR rt is <= to zero
BGEZALC: Compact branch-and-link if GPR rt is >= to zero
BLEZC  : Compact branch if GPR rt is <= to zero
BGEZC  : Compact branch if GPR rt is >= to zero
BGEC   : Compact branch if GPR rs is less than or equal to GPR rt
BGEUC  : Similar to BGEC but unsigned.
