[media] lmedm04: Create frontend call back for read status

Create dm04_read_status to check lock through either interrupt values
or directly by the call back.

When the device is not streaming the frontends original call back is
used. When streaming has started it turns off I2C messaging by
setting st->i2c_talk_onoff to zero. I2C can only be turn on again
by one of the other allowed frontend calls.

All old code is removed from lme2510_msg and this function only needs
to set st->i2c_talk_onoff to 1.

The lock status is saved and when the frondend is locked is maintained
by lme2510_int_response who will now just kill the lock.

The call back for rs2000 tuner is nologer required.

All frontend types have been tested.
