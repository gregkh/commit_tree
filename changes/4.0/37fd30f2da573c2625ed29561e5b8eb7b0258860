fib_trie: Merge tnode_free and leaf_free into node_free

Both the leaf and the tnode had an rcu_head in them, but they had them in
slightly different places.  Since we now have them in the same spot and
know that any node with bits == 0 is a leaf and the rest are either vmalloc
or kmalloc tnodes depending on the value of bits it makes it easy to combine
the functions and reduce overhead.

In addition I have taken advantage of the rcu_head pointer to go ahead and
put together a simple linked list instead of using the tnode pointer as
this way we can merge either type of structure for freeing.
