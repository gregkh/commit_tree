ACPI / idle: Implement ->enter_freeze callback routine

Add an ->enter_freeze callback routine, acpi_idle_enter_freeze(), to
the ACPI cpuidle driver and point ->enter_freeze to it for all the
C2-type and C3-type states that don't need to fall back to C1
(which may be halt-induced and that will re-enable interrupts on
exit from idle, which ->enter_freeze cannot do).
