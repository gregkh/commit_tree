ARM: 8256/1: driver coamba: add device binding path 'driver_override'

As already demonstrated with PCI [1] and the platform bus [2], a
driver_override property in sysfs can be used to bypass the id
matching of a device to a AMBA driver. This can be used by VFIO to
bind to any AMBA device requested by the user.
