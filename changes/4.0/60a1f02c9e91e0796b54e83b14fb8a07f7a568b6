arm64: decode ESR_ELx.EC when reporting exceptions

To aid the developer when something triggers an unexpected exception,
decode the ESR_ELx.EC field when logging an ESR_ELx value. This doesn't
tell the developer the specifics of the exception encoded in the
remaining IL and ISS bits, but it can be helpful to distinguish between
exception classes (e.g. SError and a data abort) without having to
manually decode the field, which can be tiresome.
