bnx2x: fix encapsulation features on 57710/57711

E1x chips (57710, 57711(E)) have no support for encapsulation
offload. bnx2x incorrectly advertises the support as available.

Setting of those features is conditional on "!CHIP_IS_E1x(bp)", but
the bp struct is not initialized yet at this point and consequently
any chip passes the check.
The check must use the "chip_is_e1x" local variable instead to work
correctly.
