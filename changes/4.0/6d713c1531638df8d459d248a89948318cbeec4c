usb: dwc2: gadget: report disconnection after reset

If usb bus is reset without a physical disconnection, all endpoints
will remain open. Call s3c_hsotg_disconnect() from reset handler to
report a disconnect to gadget framework. hsotg->connected is checked
in s3c_hsotg_disconnect() before processing disconnect.

In some cases, USBRst is seen before EnumDone and after it as well.
So move setting of hsotg->connected to set-address to avoid reporting
extra disconnection in this case.
