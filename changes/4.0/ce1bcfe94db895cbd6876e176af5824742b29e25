cpufreq: check cpufreq_policy_list instead of scanning policies for all CPUs

CPUFREQ_STICKY flag is set by drivers which don't want to get unregistered
even if cpufreq-core isn't able to initialize policy for any CPU.

When this flag isn't set, we try to unregister the driver. To find out
which CPUs are registered and which are not, we try to check per_cpu
cpufreq_cpu_data for all CPUs. Because we have a list of valid policies
available now, we better check if the list is empty or not instead of
the 'for' loop. That will be much more efficient.
