net: fec: fix receive VLAN CTAG HW acceleration issue

The current driver support receive VLAN CTAG HW acceleration feature
(NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_RX) through software simulation. There calls the
api .skb_copy_to_linear_data_offset() to skip the VLAN tag, but there
have overlap between the two memory data point range. The patch just fix
the issue.

V2:
Michael Grzeschik suggest to use memmove() instead of skb_copy_to_linear_data_offset().
