sunvnet: improve error handling when a remote crashes

If a remote machine crashes while there are pending transmit buffers, the
sunvnet driver reallocates the ring descriptors giving us enries that have
state VIO_DESC_FREE but also an allocated skb. This results in a BUG_ON()
call when the remote reboots and we reach that point in the ring.

This patch:

1) clears pending tx packets in the ring on port reset
2) changes a BUG_ON() to a pr_warn() when a remote host has given us an invalid
	descriptor state
3) collapses multiple active buffer frees in a ring to a single message per
	ring and adds the device name and remote MAC address

This fixes the particular problem of not cleaning up pending buffers on a
reset, but also prevents us from crashing if the remote handles descriptors
out of order or sets an unexpected state for a descriptor.
