tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.
