rcu: Improve diagnostics for spurious RCU CPU stall warnings

The current RCU CPU stall warning code will print "Stall ended before
state dump start" any time that the stall-warning code is triggered on
a CPU that has already reported a quiescent state for the current grace
period and if all quiescent states have been reported for the current
grace period.  However, a true stall can result in these symptoms, for
example, by preventing RCU's grace-period kthreads from ever running

This commit therefore checks for this condition, reporting the end of
the stall only if one of the grace-period counters has actually advanced.
Otherwise, it reports the last time that the grace-period kthread made
meaningful progress.  (In normal situations, the grace-period kthread
should make meaningful progress at least every jiffies_till_next_fqs
jiffies.)
