virtio_rpmsg: set DRIVER_OK before using device

virtio spec requires that all drivers set DRIVER_OK
before using devices. While rpmsg isn't yet
included in the virtio 1 spec, previous spec versions
also required this.

virtio rpmsg violates this rule: is calls kick
before setting DRIVER_OK.

The fix isn't trivial since simply calling virtio_device_ready earlier
would mean we might get an interrupt in parallel with adding buffers.

Instead, split kick out to prepare+notify calls.  prepare before
virtio_device_ready - when we know we won't get interrupts. notify right
afterwards.
