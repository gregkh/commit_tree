trace: Use 64-bit timekeeping

The ring_buffer_producer uses 'struct timeval' to measure
its start and end times. 'struct timeval' on 32-bit systems
will have its tv_sec value overflow in year 2038 and beyond.
This patch replaces struct timeval with 'ktime_t' which uses
64-bit representation for nanoseconds.
