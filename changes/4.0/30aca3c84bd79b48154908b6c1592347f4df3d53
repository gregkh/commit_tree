ARM: shmobile: Select CONFIG_REGULATOR in defconfig once again

eb4513482d1c4882e3633528ccc48d77581b7bb1
(ARM: shmobile: Enable kzm9g board in multiplatform defconfig)
dropped CONFIG_REGULATOR from shmobile_defconfig as it was
generated using a tree where CONFIG_REGULATOR is indirectly
selected by ARCH_SH73A0.

ARCH_SH73A0 is not queued up for v3.20 and thus, baring unforeseen
changes, CONFIG_REGULATOR will not be selected by shmobile_defconfig
in that release. This causes at least SDHI to stop working on
R-Car Gen2 SoCs.
