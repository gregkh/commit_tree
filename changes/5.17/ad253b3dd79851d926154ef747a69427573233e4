dt-bindings: timer: remove rockchip,rk3066-timer compatible string from rockchip,rk-timer.yaml

The Rockchip rk3066 timers have a different register layout then rk3288
with only a 32 vs 64 bits timer channel. The timers in rk3066a.dtsi have
"snps,dw-apb-timer" as compatible string, so remove the
"rockchip,rk3066-timer" from rockchip,rk-timer.yaml
