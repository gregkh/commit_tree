crypto: x86/aesni - don't require alignment of data

x86 AES-NI routines can deal with unaligned data. Crypto context
(key, iv etc.) have to be aligned but we take care of that separately
by copying it onto the stack. We were feeding unaligned data into
crypto routines up until commit 83c83e658863 ("crypto: aesni -
refactor scatterlist processing") switched to use the full
skcipher API which uses cra_alignmask to decide data alignment.

This fixes 21% performance regression in kTLS.

Tested by booting with CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS=y
(and running thru various kTLS packets).
