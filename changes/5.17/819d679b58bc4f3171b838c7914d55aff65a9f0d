media: atomisp: comment-out JPEG format

This is already disabled on some parts of the code, and trying
to use it with current firmware causes an error:

[   53.799946] atomisp-isp2 0000:00:03.0: can't create streams
[   53.799962] atomisp-isp2 0000:00:03.0: __get_frame_info 1600x900 (padded to 0) returned -22

So, completely disable reporting it.
