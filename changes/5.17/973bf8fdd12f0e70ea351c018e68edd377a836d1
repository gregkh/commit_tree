net: sched: Clarify error message when qdisc kind is unknown

When adding a tc rule with a qdisc kind that is not supported or not
compiled into the kernel, the kernel emits the following error: "Error:
Specified qdisc not found.". Found via tdc testing when ETS qdisc was not
compiled in and it was not obvious right away what the message meant
without looking at the kernel code.

Change the error message to be more explicit and say the qdisc kind is
unknown.
