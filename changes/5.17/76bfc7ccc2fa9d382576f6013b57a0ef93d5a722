mmc: core: adjust polling interval for CMD1

In mmc_send_op_cond(), loops are continuously performed at the same
interval of 10 ms.  However the behaviour is not good for some eMMC
which can be out from a busy state earlier than 10 ms if normal.

Rather than fixing about the interval time in mmc_send_op_cond(),
let's instead convert into using the common __mmc_poll_for_busy().

The reason for adjusting the interval time is that it is important
to reduce the eMMC initialization time, especially in devices that
use eMMC as rootfs.
