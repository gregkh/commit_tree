drm/mgag200: Fix PLL setup for g200wb and g200ew

commit f86c3ed55920 ("drm/mgag200: Split PLL setup into compute and
 update functions") introduced a regression for g200wb and g200ew.
The PLLs are not set up properly, and VGA screen stays
black, or displays "out of range" message.

MGA1064_WB_PIX_PLLC_N/M/P was mistakenly replaced with
MGA1064_PIX_PLLC_N/M/P which have different addresses.

Patch tested on a Dell T310 with g200wb
