arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996-sony-xperia-tone: fix SPMI regulators declaration

Device tree for the Sony Xperia tone family of devices specifies
S9+S10+S11 SAW regulator as a part of the pmi8994_spmi_regulators device
tree node. However PMI8994 does not have these regulators, they are part
of the PM8994 device. All other MSM8996-based devices list them in the
pm8994_spmi_regulators device tree node. Move them accordingly.
