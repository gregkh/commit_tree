ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: add quirks for HDAudio DMA position information

The code inherited from the Skylake driver does not seem to follow any
known hardware recommendations.

The only two recommended options are
a) use DPIB registers if VC1 traffic is not allowed
b) use DPIB DDR update if VC1 traffic is used

In all of SOF-based updated, VC1 is not supported so we can 'safely'
move to using DPIB registers only.

This patch keeps the legacy code, in case there was an undocumented
issue lost to history, and adds the DPIB DDR update for additional
debug.
