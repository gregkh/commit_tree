usb: chipidea: Set the DT node on the child device

The ChipIdea glue drivers just copy the glue resources to the "ci_hdrc"
child device. Instead, set the child device's DT node pointer to the
parent device's node so that platform_get_irq() can find the IRQ
resources in the DT. This removes the need for statically populating the
IRQ resources from the DT which has been deprecated for some time.
