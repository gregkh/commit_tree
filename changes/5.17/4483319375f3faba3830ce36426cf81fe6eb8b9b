staging: r8188eu: IntArray and C2hArray are set but never used

The fields IntArray and C2hArray of struct hal_data_8188e are set but
never used. Remove them and remove interrupt_handler_8188eu() since it
does nothing now.

While at it, remove the unsed defines USB_INTR_CONTENT_CPWM1_OFFSET
and USB_INTR_CONTENT_CPWM2_OFFSET as well.
