workqueue: Remove schedule() in unbind_workers()

The commit 6d25be5782e4 ("sched/core, workqueues: Distangle worker
accounting from rq lock") changed the schedule callbacks for workqueue
and moved the schedule callback from the wakeup code to at end of
schedule() in the worker's process context.

It means that the callback wq_worker_running() is guaranteed that
it sees the %WORKER_UNBOUND flag after scheduled since unbind_workers()
is running on the same CPU that all the pool's workers bound to.
