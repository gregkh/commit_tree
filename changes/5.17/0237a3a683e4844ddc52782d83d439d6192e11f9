net/smc: Introduce net namespace support for linkgroup

Currently, rdma device supports exclusive net namespace isolation,
however linkgroup doesn't know and support ibdev net namespace.
Applications in the containers don't want to share the nics if we
enabled rdma exclusive mode. Every net namespaces should have their own
linkgroups.

This patch introduce a new field net for linkgroup, which is standing
for the ibdev net namespace in the linkgroup. The net in linkgroup is
initialized with the net namespace of link's ibdev. It compares the net
of linkgroup and sock or ibdev before choose it, if no matched, create
new one in current net namespace. If rdma net namespace exclusive mode
is not enabled, it behaves as before.
