ACPI: CPPC: Implement support for SystemIO registers

According to the ACPI v6.2 (and later) specification, SystemIO can be
used for _CPC registers. This teaches cppc_acpi how to handle such
registers.

This patch was tested using the amd_pstate driver on my Zephyrus G15
(model GA503QS) using the current version 410 BIOS, which uses
a SystemIO register for the HighestPerformance element in _CPC.
