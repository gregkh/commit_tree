KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Use kvm_arch_vcpu_get_wait() to get rcuwait object

Use kvm_arch_vcpu_get_wait() to get a vCPU's rcuwait object instead of
using vcpu->wait directly in kvmhv_run_single_vcpu().  Functionally, this
is a nop as vcpu->arch.waitp is guaranteed to point at vcpu->wait.  But
that is not obvious at first glance, and a future change coming in via
the KVM tree, commit 510958e99721 ("KVM: Force PPC to define its own
rcuwait object"), will hide vcpu->wait from architectures that define
__KVM_HAVE_ARCH_WQP to prevent generic KVM from attepting to wake a vCPU
with the wrong rcuwait object.
