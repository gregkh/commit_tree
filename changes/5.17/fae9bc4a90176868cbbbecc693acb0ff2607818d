truncate: Convert invalidate_inode_pages2_range() to use a folio

If we're going to unmap a folio, we have to be sure to unmap the entire
folio, not just the part of it which lies after the search index.

We cannot yet remove the struct page from invalidate_inode_pages2_range()
because the page pointer in the pvec might be a shadow/dax/swap entry
instead of actually a page.
