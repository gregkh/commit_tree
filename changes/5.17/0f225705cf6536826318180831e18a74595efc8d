dmaengine: idxd: fix wq settings post wq disable

By the spec, wq size and group association is not changeable unless device
is disabled. Exclude clearing the shadow copy on wq disable/reset. This
allows wq type to be changed after disable to be re-enabled.

Move the size and group association to its own cleanup and only call it
during device disable.
