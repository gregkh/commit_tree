tpm: fix NPE on probe for missing device

When using the tpm_tis-spi driver on a system missing the physical TPM,
a null pointer exception was observed.

    [    0.938677] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
    [    0.939020] pgd = 10c753cb
    [    0.939237] [00000004] *pgd=00000000
    [    0.939808] Internal error: Oops: 5 [#1] SMP ARM
    [    0.940157] CPU: 0 PID: 48 Comm: kworker/u4:1 Not tainted 5.15.10-dd1e40c #1
    [    0.940364] Hardware name: Generic DT based system
    [    0.940601] Workqueue: events_unbound async_run_entry_fn
    [    0.941048] PC is at tpm_tis_remove+0x28/0xb4
    [    0.941196] LR is at tpm_tis_core_init+0x170/0x6ac

This is due to an attempt in 'tpm_tis_remove' to use the drvdata, which
was not initialized in 'tpm_tis_core_init' prior to the first error.

Move the initialization of drvdata earlier so 'tpm_tis_remove' has
access to it.
