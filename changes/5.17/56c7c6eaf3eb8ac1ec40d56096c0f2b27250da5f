perf/arm-cmn: Fix CPU hotplug unregistration

Attempting to migrate the PMU context after we've unregistered the PMU
device, or especially if we never successfully registered it in the
first place, is a woefully bad idea. It's also fundamentally pointless
anyway. Make sure to unregister an instance from the hotplug handler
*without* invoking the teardown callback.
