powerpc/64s: Make flush_and_reload_slb a no-op when radix is enabled

The radix test can exclude slb_flush_all_realmode() from being called
because flush_and_reload_slb() is only expected to flush ERAT when
called by flush_erat(), which is only on pre-ISA v3.0 CPUs that do not
support radix.

This helps the later change to make hash support configurable to not
introduce runtime changes to radix mode behaviour.
