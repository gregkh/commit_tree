RDMA/cxgb4: Use bitmap_zalloc() when applicable

Use 'bitmap_zalloc()' to simplify code, improve the semantic and avoid
some open-coded arithmetic in allocator arguments.

Using the 'zalloc' version of the allocator also saves a now useless
'bitmap_zero()' call.

Also change the corresponding 'kfree()' into 'bitmap_free()' to keep
consistency.

While at it, remove an extra space in a statement just a few lines above.
