ath10k: Fix tx hanging

While running stress tests in roaming scenarios (switching ap's every 5
seconds, we discovered a issue which leads to tx hangings of exactly 5
seconds while or after scanning for new accesspoints. We found out that
this hanging is triggered by ath10k_mac_wait_tx_complete since the
empty_tx_wq was not wake when the num_tx_pending counter reaches zero.
To fix this, we simply move the wake_up call to htt_tx_dec_pending,
since this call was missed on several locations within the ath10k code.
