btrfs: don't hold CPU for too long when defragging a file

There is a user report about "btrfs filesystem defrag" causing 120s
timeout problem.

For btrfs_defrag_file() it will iterate all file extents if called from
defrag ioctl, thus it can take a long time.

There is no reason not to release the CPU during such a long operation.

Add cond_resched() after defragged one cluster.
