Revert "PCI/portdrv: Do not setup up IRQs if there are no users"

This reverts commit 0e8ae5a6ff5952253cd7cc0260df838ab4c21009.

0e8ae5a6ff59 ("PCI/portdrv: Do not setup up IRQs if there are no users")
reduced usage of IRQs when we don't think we need them.  But Joey, Sergiu,
and David reported choppy GUI rendering, systems that became unresponsive
every few seconds, incorrect values reported by cpufreq, and high IRQ 16
CPU usage.

Joey bisected the issues to 0e8ae5a6ff59, so revert it until we figure out
a better solution.
