vdpa: Provide interface to read driver features

Provide an interface to read the negotiated features. This is needed
when building the netlink message in vdpa_dev_net_config_fill().

Also fix the implementation of vdpa_dev_net_config_fill() to use the
negotiated features instead of the device features.

To make APIs clearer, make the following name changes to struct
vdpa_config_ops so they better describe their operations:

get_features -> get_device_features
set_features -> set_driver_features

Finally, add get_driver_features to return the negotiated features and
add implementation to all the upstream drivers.
