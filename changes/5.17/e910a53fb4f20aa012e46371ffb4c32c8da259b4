KVM: x86: nSVM: disallow userspace setting of MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO to non default value when tsc scaling disabled

If nested tsc scaling is disabled, MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO should
never have non default value.

Due to way nested tsc scaling support was implmented in qemu,
it would set this msr to 0 when nested tsc scaling was disabled.
Ignore that value for now, as it causes no harm.
