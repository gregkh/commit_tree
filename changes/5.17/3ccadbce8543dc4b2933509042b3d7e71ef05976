drm/i915/gemfs: don't mark huge_opt as static

vfs_kernel_mount() modifies the passed in mount options, leaving us with
"huge", instead of "huge=within_size". Normally this shouldn't matter
with the usual module load/unload flow, however with the core_hotunplug
IGT we are hitting the following, when re-probing the memory regions:

i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] Transparent Hugepage mode 'huge'
tmpfs: Bad value for 'huge'
[drm] Unable to create a private tmpfs mount, hugepage support will be disabled(-22).
