x86/sev: Rename mem_encrypt.c to mem_encrypt_amd.c

Both Intel TDX and AMD SEV implement memory encryption features. But the
bulk of the code in mem_encrypt.c is AMD-specific. Rename the file to
mem_encrypt_amd.c. A subsequent patch will extract the parts that can be
shared by both TDX and AMD SEV/SME into a generic file.

No functional changes.
