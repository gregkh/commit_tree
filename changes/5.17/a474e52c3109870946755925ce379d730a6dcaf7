mmc: jz4740: Support using a bi-directional DMA channel

Since the MMC/SD controller in Ingenic SoCs work in half-duplex, it is
possible to use one single DMA channel for both TX and RX operations,
instead of using separate channels.

As some older Ingenic SoCs offer only a handful of DMA channels,
supporting bi-directional channels allow more hardware to use the
channels that would otherwise be used for the MMC/SD operation.
