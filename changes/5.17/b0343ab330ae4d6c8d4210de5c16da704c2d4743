ARM: reduce the information printed in call traces

A while back, Linus complained about the numeric values printed by the
ARM backtracing code. Printing these values does not make sense if one
does not have access to the kernel ELF image (as is normally the case
when helping a third party on a mailing list), but if one does, they
can be very useful to find the code, rather than searching for the
function name, and then doing hex math to work out where the backtrace
entry is referring to.

Provide an option to control whether this information is included,
which will only be visible if EXPERT is enabled.
