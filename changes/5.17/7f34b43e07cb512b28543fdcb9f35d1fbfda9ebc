arm64: fix clang warning about TRAMP_VALIAS

The newly introduced TRAMP_VALIAS definition causes a build warning
with clang-14:

arch/arm64/include/asm/vectors.h:66:31: error: arithmetic on a null pointer treated as a cast from integer to pointer is a GNU extension [-Werror,-Wnull-pointer-arithmetic]
                return (char *)TRAMP_VALIAS + SZ_2K * slot;

Change the addition to something clang does not complain about.
