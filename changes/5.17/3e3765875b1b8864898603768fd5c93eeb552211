mtd: phram: Prevent divide by zero bug in phram_setup()

The problem is that "erasesize" is a uint64_t type so it might be
non-zero but the lower 32 bits are zero so when it's truncated,
"(uint32_t)erasesize", then that value is zero. This leads to a
divide by zero bug.

Avoid the bug by delaying the divide until after we have validated
that "erasesize" is non-zero and within the uint32_t range.
