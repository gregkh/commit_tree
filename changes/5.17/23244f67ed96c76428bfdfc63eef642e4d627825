drm/nouveau/kms/nvd9-nv138: Fix CRC calculation for the cursor channel

Something that didn't get noticed until I started running cursor tests:
we're accidentally disabling an option for CRC calculation that's enabled
by default: WidePipeCrc, which controls whether we use the full width of
the data in the display pipe in order calculate CRCs. Having this disabled
apparently causes frames with the cursor plane enabled to generate
different CRCs than frames without the cursor plane enabled, even if the
frames are pixel-equivalent.

So, let's make sure to enable this and fix a bunch of cursor related tests
in IGT.

v2:
* Nvidia added the specific bit we were using to fix this issues to
  open-gpu-docs, so pull in the actual macro definitions for it
