KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Move host OS save/restore functions to built-in

Move the P9 guest/host register switching functions to the built-in
P9 entry code, and export it for nested to use as well.

This allows more flexibility in scheduling these supervisor privileged
SPR accesses with the HV privileged and PR SPR accesses in the low level
entry code.
