et131x: Remove useless DMA-32 fallback configuration

As stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask never fails if
dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

Moreover, dma_set_mask_and_coherent() returns 0 or -EIO, so the return
code of the function can be used directly. There is no need to 'rc = -EIO'
explicitly.

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.
