habanalabs: Move frequency change thread to goya_late_init

Changing the frequency automatically is only done in Goya. In future
ASICs this is done inside the firmware. Therefore, move the common code
into the Goya specific files.

Main changes as part of the commit are:
    1. The thread for setting frequency is moved from device_late_init
       to goya_late_init
    2. hl_device_set_frequency is removed from hl_device_open as it is
       not relevant for other ASICs and for Goya it is taken care by
       the thread
    3. hl_device_set_frequency is renamed as goya_set_frequency
