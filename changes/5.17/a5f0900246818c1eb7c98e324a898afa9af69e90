media: ipu3-cio2: Toggle sensor streaming in pm runtime ops

The .suspend() and .resume() runtime_pm operations for the ipu3-cio2
driver currently do not handle the sensor's stream. Setting .s_stream() on
or off for the sensor subdev means that sensors will pause and resume the
stream at the appropriate time even if their drivers don't implement those
operations.
