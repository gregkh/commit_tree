crypto: api - Move cryptomgr soft dependency into algapi

The soft dependency on cryptomgr is only needed in algapi because
if algapi isn't present then no algorithms can be loaded.  This
also fixes the case where api is built-in but algapi is built as
a module as the soft dependency would otherwise get lost.
