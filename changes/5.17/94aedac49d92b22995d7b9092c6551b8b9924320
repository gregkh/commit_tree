iommu: Log iova range in map/unmap trace events

In case of an iommu page fault, the faulting iova is logged
in trace_io_page_fault. It is therefore convenient to log
the iova range in mapping/unmapping trace events so that it
is easier to see if the faulting iova was recently in any of
those ranges.
