erofs: add on-disk compressed tail-packing inline support

Introduces erofs compressed tail-packing inline support.

This approach adds a new field called `h_idata_size' in the
per-file compression header to indicate the encoded size of
each tail-packing pcluster.

At runtime, it will find the start logical offset of the tail
pcluster when initializing per-inode zmap and record such
extent (headlcn, idataoff) information to the in-memory inode.
Therefore, follow-on requests can directly recognize if one
pcluster is a tail-packing inline pcluster or not.
