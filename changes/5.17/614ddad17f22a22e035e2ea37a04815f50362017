rcu: Tighten rcu_advance_cbs_nowake() checks

Currently, rcu_advance_cbs_nowake() checks that a grace period is in
progress, however, that grace period could end just after the check.
This commit rechecks that a grace period is still in progress while
holding the rcu_node structure's lock.  The grace period cannot end while
the current CPU's rcu_node structure's ->lock is held, thus avoiding
false positives from the WARN_ON_ONCE().

As Daniel Vacek noted, it is not necessary for the rcu_node structure
to have a CPU that has not yet passed through its quiescent state.
