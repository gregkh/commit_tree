iwlwifi: mvm: fix AUX ROC removal

When IWL_UCODE_TLV_CAPA_SESSION_PROT_CMD is set, removing a time event
always tries to cancel session protection. However, AUX ROC does
not use session protection so it was never removed. As a result,
if the driver tries to allocate another AUX ROC event right after
cancelling the first one, it will fail with a warning.
In addition, the time event data passed to iwl_mvm_remove_aux_roc_te()
is incorrect. Fix it.
