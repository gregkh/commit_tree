drm/nouveau/kms/nv140-: Add CRC methods to gv100_disp_core_mthd_head

Noticed this while trying to figure out the bit that we need to set in
order to get cursor CRCs to come up correctly on volta+: we never actually
went and added these methods to gv100_disp_core_mthd_head in
drm/nouveau/nvkm/engine/disp/coregv100.c which means we don't trace their
values when disp tracing is enabled in nvkm. So, fix that.
