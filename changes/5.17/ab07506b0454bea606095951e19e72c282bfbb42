iwlwifi: fix leaks/bad data after failed firmware load

If firmware load fails after having loaded some parts of the
firmware, e.g. the IML image, then this would leak. For the
host command list we'd end up running into a WARN on the next
attempt to load another firmware image.

Fix this by calling iwl_dealloc_ucode() on failures, and make
that also clear the data so we start fresh on the next round.
