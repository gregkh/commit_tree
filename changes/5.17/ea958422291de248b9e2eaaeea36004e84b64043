drm/i915/opregion: check port number bounds for SWSCI display power state

The mapping from enum port to whatever port numbering scheme is used by
the SWSCI Display Power State Notification is odd, and the memory of it
has faded. In any case, the parameter only has space for ports numbered
[0..4], and UBSAN reports bit shift beyond it when the platform has port
F or more.

Since the SWSCI functionality is supposed to be obsolete for new
platforms (i.e. ones that might have port F or more), just bail out
early if the mapped and mangled port number is beyond what the Display
Power State Notification can support.
