media: uvcvideo: Increase UVC_CTRL_CONTROL_TIMEOUT to 5 seconds.

Some uvc devices appear to require the maximum allowed USB timeout
for GET_CUR/SET_CUR requests.

So lets just bump the UVC control timeout to 5 seconds which is the
same as the usb ctrl get/set defaults:
USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT 5000
USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT 5000

It fixes the following runtime warnings:
   Failed to query (GET_CUR) UVC control 11 on unit 2: -110 (exp. 1).
   Failed to query (SET_CUR) UVC control 3 on unit 2: -110 (exp. 2).
