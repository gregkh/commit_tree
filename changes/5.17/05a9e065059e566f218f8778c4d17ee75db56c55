KVM: x86: Sync the states size with the XCR0/IA32_XSS at, any time

XCR0 is reset to 1 by RESET but not INIT and IA32_XSS is zeroed by
both RESET and INIT. The kvm_set_msr_common()'s handling of MSR_IA32_XSS
also needs to update kvm_update_cpuid_runtime(). In the above cases, the
size in bytes of the XSAVE area containing all states enabled by XCR0 or
(XCRO | IA32_XSS) needs to be updated.

For simplicity and consistency, existing helpers are used to write values
and call kvm_update_cpuid_runtime(), and it's not exactly a fast path.
