powerpc/inst: Move ppc_inst_t definition in asm/reg.h

Because of circular inclusion of asm/hw_breakpoint.h, we
need to move definition of asm/reg.h outside of inst.h
so that asm/hw_breakpoint.h gets it without including
asm/inst.h

Also remove asm/inst.h from asm/uprobes.h as it's not
needed anymore.
