ext4: avoid trim error on fs with small groups

A user reported FITRIM ioctl failing for him on ext4 on some devices
without apparent reason.  After some debugging we've found out that
these devices (being LVM volumes) report rather large discard
granularity of 42MB and the filesystem had 1k blocksize and thus group
size of 8MB. Because ext4 FITRIM implementation puts discard
granularity into minlen, ext4_trim_fs() declared the trim request as
invalid. However just silently doing nothing seems to be a more
appropriate reaction to such combination of parameters since user did
not specify anything wrong.
