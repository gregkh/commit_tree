Clang static analysis reports this issues
ice_common.c:5008:21: warning: The left expression of the compound
  assignment is an uninitialized value. The computed value will
  also be garbage
  ldo->phy_type_low |= ((u64)buf << (i * 16));
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^

When called from ice_cfg_phy_fec() ldo is the uninitialized local
variable tlv.  So initialize.
