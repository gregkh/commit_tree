net: lan966x: add support for interrupts from analyzer

This patch adds support for handling the interrupts generated by the
analyzer. Currently, only the MAC table generates these interrupts.
The MAC table will generate an interrupt whenever it learns or forgets
an entry in the table. It is the SW responsibility figure out which
entries were added/removed.
