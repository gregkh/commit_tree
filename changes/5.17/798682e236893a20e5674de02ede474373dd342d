platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Properly indent code in tpacpi_dytc_profile_init()

The previous refactoring of some code in tpacpi_dytc_profile_init() left
a weirdly indented code-block behind.

Remove the unnecessary '{}' and reduce the indent level one step,
other then changing the indentation the code is completely unchanged.
