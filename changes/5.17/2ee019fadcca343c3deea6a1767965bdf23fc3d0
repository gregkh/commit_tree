fuse: negotiate per inode DAX in FUSE_INIT

Among the FUSE_INIT phase, client shall advertise per inode DAX if it's
mounted with "dax=inode". Then server is aware that client is in per
inode DAX mode, and will construct per-inode DAX attribute accordingly.

Server shall also advertise support for per inode DAX. If server doesn't
support it while client is mounted with "dax=inode", client will
silently fallback to "dax=never" since "dax=inode" is advisory only.
