kvm: x86: Fix xstate_required_size() to follow XSTATE alignment rule

CPUID.0xD.1.EBX enumerates the size of the XSAVE area (in compacted
format) required by XSAVES. If CPUID.0xD.i.ECX[1] is set for a state
component (i), this state component should be located on the next
64-bytes boundary following the preceding state component in the
compacted layout.

Fix xstate_required_size() to follow the alignment rule. AMX is the
first state component with 64-bytes alignment to catch this bug.
