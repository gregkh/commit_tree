ACPICA: actypes.h: Expand the ACPI_ACCESS_ definitions

ACPICA commit bc02c76d518135531483dfc276ed28b7ee632ce1

The current ACPI_ACCESS_*_WIDTH defines do not provide a way to
test that size is small enough to not cause an overflow when
applied to a 32-bit integer.

Rather than adding more magic numbers, add ACPI_ACCESS_*_SHIFT,
ACPI_ACCESS_*_MAX, and ACPI_ACCESS_*_DEFAULT #defines and
redefine ACPI_ACCESS_*_WIDTH in terms of the new #defines.

This was inititally reported on Linux where a size of 102 in
ACPI_ACCESS_BIT_WIDTH caused an overflow error in the SPCR
initialization code.
