cpufreq: qcom-hw: Set CPU affinity of dcvsh interrupts

In runtime CPU cluster specific dcvsh interrupts may be handled on
unrelated CPU cores, it leads to an issue of too excessive number of
received and handled interrupts, but this is not observed, if CPU
affinity of the interrupt handler is set in accordance to CPU clusters.

The change reduces a number of received interrupts in about 10-100 times.
