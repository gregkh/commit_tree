HID: vivaldi: fix sysfs attributes leak

The driver creates the top row map sysfs attribute in input_configured()
method; unfortunately we do not have a callback that is executed when HID
interface is unbound, thus we are leaking these sysfs attributes, for
example when device is disconnected.

To fix it let's switch to managed version of adding sysfs attributes which
will ensure that they are destroyed when the driver is unbound.
