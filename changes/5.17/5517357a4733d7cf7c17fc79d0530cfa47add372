clk: bcm-2835: Pick the closest clock rate

The driver currently tries to pick the closest rate that is lower than
the rate being requested.

This causes an issue with clk_set_min_rate() since it actively checks
for the rounded rate to be above the minimum that was just set.

Let's change the logic a bit to pick the closest rate to the requested
rate, no matter if it's actually higher or lower.
