net: dsa: sja1105: let deferred packets time out when sent to ports going down

This code is not necessary and complicates the conversion of this driver
to tagger-owned memory. If there is a PTP packet that is sent
concurrently with the port getting disabled, the deferred xmit mechanism
is robust enough to time out when it sees that it hasn't been delivered,
and recovers.
