btrfs: autodefrag: only scan one inode once

Although we have btrfs_requeue_inode_defrag(), for autodefrag we are
still just exhausting all inode_defrag items in the tree.

This means, it doesn't make much difference to requeue an inode_defrag,
other than scan the inode from the beginning till its end.

Change the behaviour to always scan from offset 0 of an inode, and till
the end.

By this we get the following benefit:

- Straight-forward code

- No more re-queue related check

- Fewer members in inode_defrag

We still keep the same btrfs_get_fs_root() and btrfs_iget() check for
each loop, and added extra should_auto_defrag() check per-loop.

Note: the patch needs to be backported and is intentionally written
to minimize the diff size, code will be cleaned up later.
