powerpc/64s: Mask NIP before checking against SRR0

When CONFIG_PPC_RFI_SRR_DEBUG=y we check that NIP and SRR0 match when
returning from interrupts. This can trigger falsely if NIP has either of
its two low bits set via sigreturn or ptrace, while SRR0 has its low two
bits masked in hardware.

As a quick fix make sure to mask the low bits before doing the check.
