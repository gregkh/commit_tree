printk/console: Split out code that enables default console

Put the code enabling a console by default into a separate function
called try_enable_default_console().

Rename try_enable_new_console() to try_enable_preferred_console() to
make the purpose of the different variants more clear.

It is a code refactoring without any functional change.
