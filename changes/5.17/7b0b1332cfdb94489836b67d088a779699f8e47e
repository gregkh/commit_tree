ocfs2: fix crash when initialize filecheck kobj fails

Once s_root is set, genric_shutdown_super() will be called if
fill_super() fails.  That means, we will call ocfs2_dismount_volume()
twice in such case, which can lead to kernel crash.

Fix this issue by initializing filecheck kobj before setting s_root.
