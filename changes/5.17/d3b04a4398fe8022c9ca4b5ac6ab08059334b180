security: DH - use KDF implementation from crypto API

The kernel crypto API provides the SP800-108 counter KDF implementation.
Thus, the separate implementation provided as part of the keys subsystem
can be replaced with calls to the KDF offered by the kernel crypto API.

The keys subsystem uses the counter KDF with a hash primitive. Thus,
it only uses the call to crypto_kdf108_ctr_generate.
