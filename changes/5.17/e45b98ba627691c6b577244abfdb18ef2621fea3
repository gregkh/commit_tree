drm/i915: Avoid allocating a page array for the gpu coredump

The gpu coredump typically takes place in a dma_fence signalling
critical path, and hence can't use GFP_KERNEL allocations, as that
means we might hit deadlocks under memory pressure. However
changing to __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM which will be done in an upcoming
patch will instead mean a lower chance of the allocation succeeding.
In particular large contigous allocations like the coredump page
vector.
Remove the page vector in favor of a linked list of single pages.
Use the page lru list head as the list link, as the page owner is
allowed to do that.
