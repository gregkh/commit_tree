i2c: exynos5: Add bus clock support

In new Exynos SoCs (like Exynos850) where HSI2C is implemented as a
part of USIv2 block, there are two clocks provided to HSI2C controller:
  - PCLK: bus clock (APB), provides access to register interface
  - IPCLK: operating IP-core clock; SCL is derived from this one

Both clocks have to be asserted for HSI2C to be functional in that case.

Add code to obtain and enable/disable PCLK in addition to already
handled operating clock. Make it optional though, as older Exynos SoC
variants only have one HSI2C clock.
