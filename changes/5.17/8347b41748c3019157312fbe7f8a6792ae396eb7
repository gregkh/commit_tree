of: fdt: Aggregate the processing of "linux,usable-memory-range"

Currently, we parse the "linux,usable-memory-range" property in
early_init_dt_scan_chosen(), to obtain the specified memory range of the
crash kernel. We then reserve the required memory after
early_init_dt_scan_memory() has identified all available physical memory.
Because the two pieces of code are separated far, the readability and
maintainability are reduced. So bring them together.

(change the prototype of early_init_dt_check_for_usable_mem_range(), in
order to use it outside)
