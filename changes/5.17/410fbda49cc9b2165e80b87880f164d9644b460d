clocksource/drivers/exynos_mct: Fix silly typo resulting in checkpatch warning

Commit ae460fd9164b ("clocksource/drivers/exynos_mct: Prioritise Arm
arch timer on arm64") changed the rating of the MCT clockevents device
to be lower than the Arm architected timer and, in the process, replaced
a semicolon with a comma thanks to a silly copy-paste error.

Put the semicolon back so that the code looks more idiomatic and resolve
the SUSPECT_COMMA_SEMICOLON warning from checkpatch at the same time.
