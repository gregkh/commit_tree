arm64: dts: mt8183: jacuzzi: Fix bus properties in anx's DSI endpoint

mt8183-kukui-jacuzzi has an anx7625 bridge connected to the output of
its DSI host. However, after commit fd0310b6fe7d ("drm/bridge: anx7625:
add MIPI DPI input feature"), a bus-type property started being required
in the endpoint node by the driver to indicate whether it is DSI or DPI.

Add the missing bus-type property and set it to 5
(V4L2_FWNODE_BUS_TYPE_PARALLEL) so that the driver has its input
configured to DSI and the display pipeline can probe correctly.

While at it, also set the data-lanes property that was also introduced
in that same commit, so that we don't rely on the default value.
