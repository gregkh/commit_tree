net-sysfs: warn if new queue objects are being created during device unregistration

Calling netdev_queue_update_kobjects is allowed during device
unregistration since commit 5c56580b74e5 ("net: Adjust TX queue kobjects
if number of queues changes during unregister"). But this is solely to
allow queue unregistrations. Any path attempting to add new queues after
a device started its unregistration should be fixed.

This patch adds a warning to detect such illegal use.
