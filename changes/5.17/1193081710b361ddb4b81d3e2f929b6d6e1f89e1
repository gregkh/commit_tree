drm/i915: Avoid using the i915_fence_array when collecting dependencies

Since the gt migration code was using only a single fence for
dependencies, these were collected in a dma_fence_array. However, it
turns out that it's illegal to use some dma_fences in a dma_fence_array,
in particular other dma_fence_arrays and dma_fence_chains, and this
causes trouble for us moving forward.

Have the gt migration code instead take a const struct i915_deps for
dependencies. This means we can skip the dma_fence_array creation
and instead pass the struct i915_deps instead to circumvent the
problem.

v2:
- Make the prev_deps() function static. (kernel test robot <lkp@intel.com>)
- Update the struct i915_deps kerneldoc.
v4:
- Rebase.
