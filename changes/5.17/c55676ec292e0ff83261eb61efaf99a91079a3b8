ASoC: dt-bindings: qcom: sm8250: Drop redundant MultiMedia routes

The MultiMedia audio routes can be deduced from other parts of the
device tree (e.g. the definitions of the MultiMedia DAIs) and therefore
specifying them again in "audio-routing" is redundant and prone to
mistakes. This is no longer necessary since commit 6fd8d2d275f7
("ASoC: qcom: qdsp6: Move frontend AIFs to q6asm-dai").

Let's drop them from the example in the DT schema as well
to avoid confusion.
