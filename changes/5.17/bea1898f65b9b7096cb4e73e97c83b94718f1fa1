ice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler

Currently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO
LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is
causing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has
a different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem
manifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.

Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only
is passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the
NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.

Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev
and related braces.
