ACPI: EC: Make the event work state machine visible

The EC driver uses a relatively simple state machine for the event
work handling, but it is not really straightforward to figure out.

The states are as follows:

 "Ready": The event handling work can be submitted.

  In this state, the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING flag is clear.

 "In progress": The event handling work is pending or is being
                processed.  It cannot be submitted again.

  In ths state, the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING flag is set and both the
  events_to_process count is nonzero and the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_GUARDING
  flag is clear.

 "Complete": The event handling work has been completed, but it still
             cannot be submitted again.

  In ths state, the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING flag is set and the
  events_to_process count is zero or the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_GUARDING
  flag is set.

The state changes from "Ready" to "In progress" when new event is
detected by advance_transaction() and acpi_ec_submit_event() is
called by it.

Next, the state can change from "In progress" directly to "Ready" in
the following situations:

 * ec_event_clearing is ACPI_EC_EVT_TIMING_STATUS and the state of
   an ACPI_EC_COMMAND_QUERY transaction becomes ACPI_EC_COMMAND_POLL.

 * ec_event_clearing is ACPI_EC_EVT_TIMING_QUERY and the state of
   an ACPI_EC_COMMAND_QUERY transaction becomes
   ACPI_EC_COMMAND_COMPLETE.

 * ec_event_clearing is either ACPI_EC_EVT_TIMING_STATUS or
   ACPI_EC_EVT_TIMING_QUERY and there are no more events to
   process (ie. ec->events_to_process becomes 0).

If ec_event_clearing is ACPI_EC_EVT_TIMING_EVENT, however, the
state must change from "In progress" to "Complete" before it
can change to "Ready".  The changes from "In progress" to
"Complete" in that case occur in the following situations:

 * The state of an ACPI_EC_COMMAND_QUERY transaction becomes
   ACPI_EC_COMMAND_COMPLETE.

 * There are no more events to process (ie. ec->events_to_process
   becomes 0).

Finally, the state changes from "Complete" to "Ready" when
advance_transaction() is invoked when the state is "Complete" and
the state of the current transaction is not ACPI_EC_COMMAND_POLL.

To make this state machine visible in the code, add a new
event_state field to struct acpi_ec and modify the code to use
it istead the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING and EC_FLAGS_QUERY_GUARDING
flags.
