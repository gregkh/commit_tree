s390/ftrace: fix arch_ftrace_get_regs implementation

arch_ftrace_get_regs is supposed to return a struct pt_regs pointer
only if the pt_regs structure contains all register contents, which
means it must have been populated when created via ftrace_regs_caller.

If it was populated via ftrace_caller the contents are not complete
(the psw mask part is missing), and therefore a NULL pointer needs be
returned.

The current code incorrectly always returns a struct pt_regs pointer.

Fix this by adding another pt_regs flag which indicates if the
contents are complete, and fix arch_ftrace_get_regs accordingly.
