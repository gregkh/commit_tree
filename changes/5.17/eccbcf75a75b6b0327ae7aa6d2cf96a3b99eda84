staging: vc04_services: rename variables containing bm2835_* to bcm2835_*

In the kernel, all names related to the chip BCM2835 are always named
bcm2835_*. To avoid confusion, and to make things more consistent,
rename all variables using bm2835_* to bcm2835_*.

While at it, some realignments were made to improve readability.
