powerpc/64/asm: Do not reassign labels

The LLVM integrated assembler really does not like us reassigning things
to the same label:

<instantiation>:7:9: error: invalid reassignment of non-absolute variable 'fs_label'

This happens across a bunch of platforms:
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1043
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1008
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/920
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1050

There is no hope of getting this fixed in LLVM (see
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1043#issuecomment-641571200
and https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47798#c1 )
so if we want to build with LLVM_IAS, we need to hack
around it ourselves.

For us the big problem comes from this:

\#define USE_FIXED_SECTION(sname)				\
	fs_label = start_##sname;				\
	fs_start = sname##_start;				\
	use_ftsec sname;

\#define USE_TEXT_SECTION()
	fs_label = start_text;					\
	fs_start = text_start;					\
	.text

and in particular fs_label.

This works around it by not setting those 'variables' and requiring
that users of the variables instead track for themselves what section
they are in. This isn't amazing, by any stretch, but it gets us further
in the compilation.

Note that even though users have to keep track of the section, using
a wrong one produces an error with both binutils and llvm which prevents
from using wrong section at the compile time:

llvm error example:

AS      arch/powerpc/kernel/head_64.o
<unknown>:0: error: Cannot represent a difference across sections
make[3]: *** [/home/aik/p/kernels-llvm/llvm/scripts/Makefile.build:388: arch/powerpc/kernel/head_64.o] Error 1

binutils error example:

/home/aik/p/kernels-llvm/llvm/arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S: Assembler messages:
/home/aik/p/kernels-llvm/llvm/arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:1974: Error: can't resolve `system_call_common' {.text section} - `start_r
