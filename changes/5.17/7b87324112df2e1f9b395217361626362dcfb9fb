random: use IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NUMA) instead of ifdefs

Rather than an awkward combination of ifdefs and __maybe_unused, we can
ensure more source gets parsed, regardless of the configuration, by
using IS_ENABLED for the CONFIG_NUMA conditional code. This makes things
cleaner and easier to follow.

I've confirmed that on !CONFIG_NUMA, we don't wind up with excess code
by accident; the generated object file is the same.
