KVM: x86: Register perf callbacks after calling vendor's hardware_setup()

Wait to register perf callbacks until after doing vendor hardaware setup.
VMX's hardware_setup() configures Intel Processor Trace (PT) mode, and a
future fix to register the Intel PT guest interrupt hook if and only if
Intel PT is exposed to the guest will consume the configured PT mode.

Delaying registration to hardware setup is effectively a nop as KVM's perf
hooks all pivot on the per-CPU current_vcpu, which is non-NULL only when
KVM is handling an IRQ/NMI in a VM-Exit path.  I.e. current_vcpu will be
NULL throughout both kvm_arch_init() and kvm_arch_hardware_setup().
