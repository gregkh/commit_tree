ASoC: SOF: Drop ctrl_type parameter for snd_sof_ipc_set_get_comp_data()

The SOF_CTRL_TYPE_VALUE_COMP_* type is not used by the firmware nor in the
kernel side.
It is also not clear what action should be taken for such type.

With this in mind:
The correct ipc_cmd can be selected based on the `ctrl_cmd` and the `set`
parameters:
if the ctrl_cmd is SOF_CTRL_CMD_BINARY then SOF_CTRL_TYPE_DATA_*
otherwise SOF_CTRL_TYPE_VALUE_CHAN_*.

The SET or GET direction can be selected with the use of `set` parameter.
