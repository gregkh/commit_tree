net/9p: show error message if user 'msize' cannot be satisfied

If user supplied a large value with the 'msize' option, then
client would silently limit that 'msize' value to the maximum
value supported by transport. That's a bit confusing for users
of not having any indication why the preferred 'msize' value
could not be satisfied.
