iwlwifi: pcie: make sure prph_info is set when treating wakeup IRQ

In some rare cases when the HW is in a bad state, we may get this
interrupt when prph_info is not set yet.  Then we will try to
dereference it to check the sleep_notif element, which will cause an
oops.

Fix that by ignoring the interrupt if prph_info is not set yet.
