drm/i915/hdmi: Turn DP++ TMDS output buffers back on in encoder->shutdown()

Looks like our VBIOS/GOP generally fail to turn the DP dual mode adater
TMDS output buffers back on after a reboot. This leads to a black screen
after reboot if we turned the TMDS output buffers off prior to reboot.
And if i915 decides to do a fastboot the black screen will persist even
after i915 takes over.

Apparently this has been a problem ever since commit b2ccb822d376 ("drm/i915:
Enable/disable TMDS output buffers in DP++ adaptor as needed") if one
rebooted while the display was turned off. And things became worse with
commit fe0f1e3bfdfe ("drm/i915: Shut down displays gracefully on reboot")
since now we always turn the display off before a reboot.

This was reported on a RKL, but I confirmed the same behaviour on my
SNB as well. So looks pretty universal.

Let's fix this by explicitly turning the TMDS output buffers back on
in the encoder->shutdown() hook. Note that this gets called after irqs
have been disabled, so the i2c communication with the DP dual mode
adapter has to be performed via polling (which the gmbus code is
perfectly happy to do for us).

We also need a bit of care in handling DDI encoders which may or may
not be set up for HDMI output. Specifically ddc_pin will not be
populated for a DP only DDI encoder, in which case we don't want to
call intel_gmbus_get_adapter(). We can handle that by simply doing
the dual mode adapter type check before calling
intel_gmbus_get_adapter().
