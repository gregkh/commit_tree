drm/meson: encoder_hdmi: switch to bridge DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR

This implements the necessary change to no more use the embedded
connector in dw-hdmi and use the dedicated bridge connector driver
by passing DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR to the bridge attach call.

The necessary connector properties are added to handle the same
functionalities as the embedded dw-hdmi connector, i.e. the HDR
metadata, the CEC notifier & other flags.

The dw-hdmi output_port is set to 1 in order to look for a connector
next bridge in order to get DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR working.
