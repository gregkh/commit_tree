bpf: Don't promote bogus looking registers after null check.

If we ever get to a point again where we convert a bogus looking <ptr>_or_null
typed register containing a non-zero fixed or variable offset, then lets not
reset these bounds to zero since they are not and also don't promote the register
to a <ptr> type, but instead leave it as <ptr>_or_null. Converting to a unknown
register could be an avenue as well, but then if we run into this case it would
allow to leak a kernel pointer this way.
