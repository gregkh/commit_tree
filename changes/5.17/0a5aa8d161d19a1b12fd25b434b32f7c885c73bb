block: fix blk_mq_attempt_bio_merge and rq_qos_throttle protection

Commit 9d497e2941c3 ("block: don't protect submit_bio_checks by
q_usage_counter") moved blk_mq_attempt_bio_merge and rq_qos_throttle
calls out of q_usage_counter protection. However, these functions require
q_usage_counter protection. The blk_mq_attempt_bio_merge call without
the protection resulted in blktests block/005 failure with KASAN null-
ptr-deref or use-after-free at bio merge. The rq_qos_throttle call
without the protection caused kernel hang at qos throttle.

To fix the failures, move the blk_mq_attempt_bio_merge and
rq_qos_throttle calls back to q_usage_counter protection.
