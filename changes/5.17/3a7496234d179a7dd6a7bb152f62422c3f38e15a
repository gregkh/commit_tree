ice: implement basic E822 PTP support

Implement support for the basic operations needed to enable the PTP
hardware clock on E822 devices.

This includes implementations for the various PHY access functions, as
well as the ability to start and stop the PHY timers. This is different
from the E810 device because the configuration depends on link speed, so
we cannot just start the PHYs immediately. We must wait until the link
is up to get proper values for the speed based initialization.
