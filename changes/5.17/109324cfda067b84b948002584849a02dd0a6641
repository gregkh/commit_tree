btrfs: move leaf search logic out of btrfs_search_slot()

There's quite a significant amount of code for doing the key search for a
leaf at btrfs_search_slot(), with a couple labels and gotos in it, plus
btrfs_search_slot() is already big enough.

So move the logic that does the key search on a leaf into a new helper
function. This makes it better organized, removing the need for the labels
and the gotos, as well as reducing the indentation level and the size of
btrfs_search_slot().
