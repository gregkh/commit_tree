clk: visconti: Remove pointless NULL check in visconti_pll_add_lookup()

Clang warns:

drivers/clk/visconti/pll.c:292:20: warning: address of array 'ctx->clk_data.hws' will always evaluate to 'true' [-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
        if (ctx->clk_data.hws && id)
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~ ~~
1 warning generated.

This array cannot be NULL if ctx is not NULL, which is allocated in
visconti_init_pll(), so just remove the check, which matches other clk
drivers.
