bpf: Silence coverity false positive warning.

Coverity issued the following warning:
6685            cands = bpf_core_add_cands(cands, main_btf, 1);
6686            if (IS_ERR(cands))
>>>     CID 1510300:    (RETURN_LOCAL)
>>>     Returning pointer "cands" which points to local variable "local_cand".
6687                    return cands;

It's a false positive.
Add ERR_CAST() to silence it.
