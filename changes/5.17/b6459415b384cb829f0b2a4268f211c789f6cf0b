net: Don't include filter.h from net/sock.h

sock.h is pretty heavily used (5k objects rebuilt on x86 after
it's touched). We can drop the include of filter.h from it and
add a forward declaration of struct sk_filter instead.
This decreases the number of rebuilt objects when bpf.h
is touched from ~5k to ~1k.

There's a lot of missing includes this was masking. Primarily
in networking tho, this time.
