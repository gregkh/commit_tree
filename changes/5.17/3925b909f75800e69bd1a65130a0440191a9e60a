soc: qcom: aoss: constify static struct thermal_cooling_device_ops

The only usage of qmp_cooling_device_ops is to pass its address to
devm_thermal_of_cooling_device_register() which takes a pointer to const
struct thermal_cooling_device_ops as argument. Make it const to allow
the compiler to put it in read-only memory.
