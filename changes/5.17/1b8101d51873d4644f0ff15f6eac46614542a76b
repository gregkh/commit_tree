platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Add hotkey_notify_extended_hotkey() helper

Factor the extended hotkey handling out of hotkey_notify_hotkey() and
into a new hotkey_notify_extended_hotkey() helper.

This is a preparation patch for adding support the privacy-screen hotkey
toggle (which needs some special handling, it should NOT send an evdev
key-event to userspace...).
