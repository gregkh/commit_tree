smb3: send NTLMSSP version information

For improved debugging it can be helpful to send version information
as other clients do during NTLMSSP negotiation. See protocol document
MS-NLMP section 2.2.1.1

Set the major and minor versions based on the kernel version, and the
BuildNumber based on the internal cifs.ko module version number,
and following the recommendation in the protocol documentation
(MS-NLMP section 2.2.10) we set the NTLMRevisionCurrent field to 15.
