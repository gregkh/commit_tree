media: i2c: Defer probe if not endpoint found

The ov8865 driver is one of those that can be connected to a CIO2
device by the cio2-bridge code. This means that the absence of an
endpoint for this device is not necessarily fatal, as one might be
built by the cio2-bridge when it probes. Return -EPROBE_DEFER if no
endpoint is found rather than a fatal error.
