fscache: Implement simple cookie state machine

Implement a very simple cookie state machine to handle lookup,
invalidation, withdrawal, relinquishment and, to be added later, commit on
LRU discard.

Three cache methods are provided: ->lookup_cookie() to look up and, if
necessary, create a data storage object; ->withdraw_cookie() to free the
resources associated with that object and potentially delete it; and
->prepare_to_write(), to do prepare for changes to the cached data to be
modified locally.

Changes
=======
ver #3:
 - Fix a race between LRU discard and relinquishment whereby the former
   would override the latter and thus the latter would never happen[1].

ver #2:
 - Don't hold n_accesses elevated whilst cache is bound to a cookie, but
   rather add a flag that prevents the state machine from being queued when
   n_accesses reaches 0.
