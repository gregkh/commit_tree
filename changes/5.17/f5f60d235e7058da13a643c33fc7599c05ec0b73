cgroup/rstat: check updated_next only for root

After commit dc26532aed0a ("cgroup: rstat: punt root-level optimization to
individual controllers"), each rstat on updated_children list has its
->updated_next not NULL.

This means we can remove the check on ->updated_next, if we make sure
the subtree from @root is on list, which could be done by checking
updated_next for root.

tj: Coding style fixes.
