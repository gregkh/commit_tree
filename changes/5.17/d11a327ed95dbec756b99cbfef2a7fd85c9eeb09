KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Restrict SEIS workaround to known broken systems

Contrary to what df652bcf1136 ("KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Work around GICv3
locally generated SErrors") was asserting, there is at least one other
system out there (Cavium ThunderX2) implementing SEIS, and not in
an obviously broken way.

So instead of imposing the M1 workaround on an innocent bystander,
let's limit it to the two known broken Apple implementations.
