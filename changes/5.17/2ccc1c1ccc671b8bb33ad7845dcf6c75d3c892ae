ice: Remove excess error variables

ice_status previously had a variable to contain these values where other
error codes had a variable as well. With ice_status now being an int,
there is no need for two variables to hold error values. In cases where
this occurs, remove one of the excess variables and use a single one.
Some initialization of variables are no longer needed and have been
removed.
