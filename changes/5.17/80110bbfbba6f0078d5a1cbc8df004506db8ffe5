  kernel BUG at mm/page_table_check.c:162!
  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN
  CPU: 0 PID: 3099 Comm: pasha Not tainted 5.16.0+ #48
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIO4

The repro involved having a huge page that is split due to uprobe event
temporarily replacing one of the pages in the huge page.  Later the huge
page was combined again, but the counters were off, as the PTE level was
not properly updated.

Make sure that when PMD is cleared and prior to freeing the level the
PTEs are updated.
