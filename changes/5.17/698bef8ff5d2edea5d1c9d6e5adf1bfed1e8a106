drm/i915: Fix dbuf slice config lookup

Apparently I totally fumbled the loop condition when I
removed the ARRAY_SIZE() stuff from the dbuf slice config
lookup. Comparing the loop index with the active_pipes bitmask
is utter nonsense, what we want to do is check to see if the
mask is zero or not.

Note that the code actually ended up working correctly despite
the fumble, up until commit eef173954432 ("drm/i915: Allow
!join_mbus cases for adlp+ dbuf configuration") when things
broke for real.
