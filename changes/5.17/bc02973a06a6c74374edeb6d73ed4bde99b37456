arm: ioremap: Implement standard PCI function pci_remap_iospace()

pci_remap_iospace() is standard PCI core function. Architecture code can
reimplement default core implementation if needs custom arch specific
functionality.

ARM needs custom implementation due to pci_ioremap_set_mem_type() hook
which allows ARM platforms to change mem type for iospace.

Implement this pci_remap_iospace() function for ARM architecture to
correctly handle pci_ioremap_set_mem_type() hook, which allows usage of
this standard PCI core function also for platforms which needs different
mem type (e.g. Marvell Armada 375, 38x and 39x).
