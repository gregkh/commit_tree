mt76: mt7921s: fix the device cannot sleep deeply in suspend

According to the MT7921S firmware, the cmd MCU_UNI_CMD_HIF_CTRL have to
be last MCU command to execute in suspend handler and all data traffic
have to be stopped before the cmd MCU_UNI_CMD_HIF_CTRL starts as well
in order that mt7921 can successfully fall into the deep sleep mode.

Where we reuse the flag MT76_STATE_SUSPEND and avoid creating
another global flag to stop all of the traffic onto the SDIO bus.
