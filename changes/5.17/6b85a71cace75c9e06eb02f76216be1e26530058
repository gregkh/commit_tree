dt-bindings: mtd: renesas: Describe Renesas R-Car Gen3 & RZ/N1 NAND controller

Add a Yaml description for this Renesas NAND controller.

As this controller is embedded on different SoC families, provide:
* a family-specific "r-car-gen3" compatible and a more specific
  "r8a77951" one
* a family-specific "rzn1" compatible and a more specific "r9a06g032"
  one

More compatibles can be added later if new SoCs with this controller
must be supported.
