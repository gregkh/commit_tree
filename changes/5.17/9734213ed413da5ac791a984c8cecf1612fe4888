tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Update max frequency

When BIOS disables turbo, the cpuinfo_max_freq will also be same as the
power up base frequency. When SST-PP causes increase in base frequency
the performance will be still limited to the old base frequency as the
cpuinfo_max_freq will not be updated.

In this case we need to update scaling_max frequency to the new
base_frequency. This will result in setting updated max performance
limit in the Pstate driver. So performance will not be limited to the
old base frequency.
