nfs41: pnfs: filelayout: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code a bit according to the use of a flexible-array member
in struct nfs4_file_layout_dsaddr instead of a one-element array, and
use the struct_size() helper.

This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle and audited and fixed,
manually.
