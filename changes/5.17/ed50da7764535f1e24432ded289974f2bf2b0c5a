arm64: entry: Don't assume tramp_vectors is the start of the vectors

The tramp_ventry macro uses tramp_vectors as the address of the vectors
when calculating which ventry in the 'full fat' vectors to branch to.

While there is one set of tramp_vectors, this will be true.
Adding multiple sets of vectors will break this assumption.

Move the generation of the vectors to a macro, and pass the start
of the vectors as an argument to tramp_ventry.
