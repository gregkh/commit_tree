KVM: x86/mmu: Clear MMU-writable during changed_pte notifier

When handling the changed_pte notifier and the new PTE is read-only,
clear both the Host-writable and MMU-writable bits in the SPTE. This
preserves the invariant that MMU-writable is set if-and-only-if
Host-writable is set.

No functional change intended. Nothing currently relies on the
aforementioned invariant and technically the changed_pte notifier is
dead code.
