device property: Fix documentation for FWNODE_GRAPH_DEVICE_DISABLED

FWNODE_GRAPH_DEVICE_DISABLED flag was meant for also returning endpoints
connected to disabled devices, but it also may return endpoints that are
not connected. Fix this in documentation. Also
fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id() was affeced by this.

Also improve the language a little bit.
