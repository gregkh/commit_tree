skbuff: introduce skb_pull_data

Like skb_pull but returns the original data pointer before pulling the
data after performing a check against sbk->len.

This allows to change code that does "struct foo *p = (void *)skb->data;"
which is hard to audit and error prone, to:

        p = skb_pull_data(skb, sizeof(*p));
        if (!p)
                return;

Which is both safer and cleaner.
