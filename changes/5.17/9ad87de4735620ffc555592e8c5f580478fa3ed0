drm/i915/dp: Ensure max link params are always valid

Atm until the DPCD for a connector is read the max link rate and lane
count params are invalid. If the connector is modeset, in
intel_dp_compute_config(), intel_dp_common_len_rate_limit(max_link_rate)
will return 0, leading to a intel_dp->common_rates[-1] access.

Fix the above by making sure the max link params are always valid.

The above access leads to an undefined behaviour by definition, though
not causing a user visible problem to my best knowledge, see the previous
patch why. Nevertheless it is an undefined behaviour and it triggers a
BUG() in CONFIG_UBSAN builds, hence CC:stable.
