topology/sysfs: export cluster attributes only if an architectures has support

The cluster_id and cluster_cpus topology sysfs attributes have been
added with commit c5e22feffdd7 ("topology: Represent clusters of CPUs
within a die").

They are currently only used for x86, arm64, and riscv (via generic
arch topology), however they are still present with bogus default
values for all other architectures. Instead of enforcing such new
sysfs attributes to all architectures, make them only optional visible
if an architecture opts in by defining both the topology_cluster_id
and topology_cluster_cpumask attributes.

This is similar to what was done when the book and drawer topology
levels were introduced: avoid useless and therefore confusing sysfs
attributes for architectures which cannot make use of them.

This should not break any existing applications, since this is a
new interface introduced with the v5.16 merge window.
