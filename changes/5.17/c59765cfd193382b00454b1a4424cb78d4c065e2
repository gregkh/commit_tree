bpftool: Use bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd directly

To prepare for impending deprecation of libbpf's
bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear, migrate uses of this function to use
bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd.

Since the profile_target_name and dump_prog_id_as_func_ptr helpers were
only looking at the first func_info, avoid grabbing the rest to save a
malloc. For do_dump, add a more full-featured helper, but avoid
free/realloc of buffer when possible for multi-prog dumps.
