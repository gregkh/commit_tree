drm/i915/hdmi: Split intel_hdmi_bpc_possible() to source vs. sink pair

intel_hdmi_bpc_possible() is used by the DP code as well where
the native HDMI source limits do not apply. So let's split this
into a pair of functions: one for the source vs. one for the sink.

This is basically reverting some of commit 41828125acd6 ("drm/i915:
Move platform checks into intel_hdmi_bpc_possible()") slightly,
but in a nicer form. I guess I forgot at the time that the DP side
uses this too.
