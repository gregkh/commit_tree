nvme-pci: add the IGNORE_DEV_SUBNQN quirk for Intel P4500/P4600 SSDs

The Intel P4500/P4600 SSDs do not report a subsystem NQN despite claiming
compliance to a standards version where reporting one is required.

Add the IGNORE_DEV_SUBNQN quirk to not fail the initialization of a
second such SSDs in a system.
