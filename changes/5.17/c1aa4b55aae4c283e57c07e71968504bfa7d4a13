PCI: mvebu: Replace pci_ioremap_io() usage by devm_pci_remap_iospace()

Now when ARM architecture code also provides standard PCI core function
pci_remap_iospace(), use its devm_pci_remap_iospace() variant in
pci-mvebu.c driver instead of old ARM-specific pci_ioremap_io() function.

Call devm_pci_remap_iospace() before adding IO resource to host bridge
structure, at the place where it should be.
