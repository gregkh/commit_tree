netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: allocate pcpu scratch maps on clone

This is needed in case a new transaction is made that doesn't insert any
new elements into an already existing set.

Else, after second 'nft -f ruleset.txt', lookups in such a set will fail
because ->lookup() encounters raw_cpu_ptr(m->scratch) == NULL.

For the initial rule load, insertion of elements takes care of the
allocation, but for rule reloads this isn't guaranteed: we might not
have additions to the set.
