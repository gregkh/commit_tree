tty: add kernel-doc for tty_port

tty_port used to have only short comments along its members. Convert
them into proper kernel-doc comments in front of the structure. And add
some more explanation to them where needed.

The whole structure purpose and handling is documented at the end too --
some pieces of preexisting text moved to this place.
