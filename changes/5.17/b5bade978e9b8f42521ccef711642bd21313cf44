mm: migrate: fix the return value of migrate_pages()

Patch series "Improve the migration stats".

According to talk with Zi Yan [1], this patch set changes the return
value of migrate_pages() to avoid returning a number which is larger
than the number of pages the users tried to migrate by move_pages()
syscall.  Also fix the hugetlb migration stats and migration stats in
trace_mm_compaction_migratepages().

This patch (of 3):

As Zi Yan pointed out, the syscall move_pages() can return a
non-migrated number larger than the number of pages the users tried to
migrate, when a THP page is failed to migrate.  This is confusing for
users.

Since other migration scenarios do not care about the actual
non-migrated number of pages except the memory compaction migration
which will fix in following patch.  Thus we can change the return value
to return the number of {normal page, THP, hugetlb} instead to avoid
this issue, and the number of THP splits will be considered as the
number of non-migrated THP, no matter how many subpages of the THP are
migrated successfully.  Meanwhile we should still keep the migration
counters using the number of normal pages.
