ath11k: allocate dst ring descriptors from cacheable memory

tcl_data and reo_dst rings are currently being allocated using
dma_allocate_coherent() which is non cacheable.

Allocating ring memory from cacheable memory area allows cached descriptor
access and prefetch next descriptors to optimize CPU usage during
descriptor processing on NAPI. Based on the hardware param we can enable
or disable this feature for the corresponding platform.
