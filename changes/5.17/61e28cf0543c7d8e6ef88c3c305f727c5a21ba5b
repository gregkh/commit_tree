memory-failure: fetch compound_head after pgmap_pfn_valid()

memory_failure_dev_pagemap() at the moment assumes base pages (e.g.
dax_lock_page()).  For devmap with compound pages fetch the
compound_head in case a tail page memory failure is being handled.

Currently this is a nop, but in the advent of compound pages in
dev_pagemap it allows memory_failure_dev_pagemap() to keep working.

Without this fix memory-failure handling (i.e.  MCEs on pmem) with
device-dax configured namespaces will regress (and crash).
