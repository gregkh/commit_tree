drm/i915/display: add intel_crtc_wait_for_next_vblank() and use it

intel_wait_for_vblank() goes through a pipe to crtc lookup, while in
most cases we already have the crtc available. Avoid the extra lookups
by adding an intel_crtc based helper.

v2:
- Add intel_crtc_wait_for_next_vblank() helper (Ville)
