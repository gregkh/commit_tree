bus: tegra-gmi: Add runtime PM and OPP support

The GMI bus on Tegra belongs to the core power domain and we're going to
enable GENPD support for the core domain. Now GMI must be resumed using
runtime PM API in order to initialize the GMI power state. Add runtime PM
and OPP support to the GMI driver.
