usb: common: ulpi: Fix crash in ulpi_match()

Commit 7495af930835 ("ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable drivers for
DragonBoard 410c") enables the CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_USB_HS for the ARM
multi_v7_defconfig. Enabling this Kconfig is causing the kernel to crash
on the Tegra20 Ventana platform in the ulpi_match() function.

The Qualcomm USB HS PHY driver that is enabled by CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_USB_HS,
registers a ulpi_driver but this driver does not provide an 'id_table',
so when ulpi_match() is called on the Tegra20 Ventana platform, it
crashes when attempting to deference the id_table pointer which is not
valid. The Qualcomm USB HS PHY driver uses device-tree for matching the
ULPI driver with the device and so fix this crash by using device-tree
for matching if the id_table is not valid.
