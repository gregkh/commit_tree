tty: serial: atmel: Check return code of dmaengine_submit()

The tx_submit() method of struct dma_async_tx_descriptor is entitled
to do sanity checks and return errors if encountered. It's not the
case for the DMA controller drivers that this client is using
(at_h/xdmac), because they currently don't do sanity checks and always
return a positive cookie at tx_submit() method. In case the controller
drivers will implement sanity checks and return errors, print a message
so that the client will be informed that something went wrong at
tx_submit() level.
