interconnect: qcom: Add QCM2290 driver support

It adds interconnect driver support for QCM2290 platform.  The topology
consists of 3 NoCs: BIMC, Config NoC (CNOC) and System NoC (SNOC).  SNOC
is a QCOM_ICC_QNOC type device, as well as its 3 virtual child devices,
QUP, MMNRT and MMRT.  QUP is owned by RPM and thus has no .regmap_cfg,
while the other 2 share the same .regmap_cfg with SNOC (parent).
