media: cxd2880: Eliminate dead code

An spi remove callback is never called with an spi_device pointer that
is NULL. Also it is only called for devices that probed successfully. As
cxd2880_spi_probe() always sets driver data, spi_get_drvdata() cannot be
NULL.

Also the return value of spi remove callbacks is ignored anyway and not
freeing resources in .remove() is a bad idea.
