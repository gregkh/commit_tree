blk-crypto: remove blk_crypto_unregister()

This function is trivial and is only used in one place.  Having this
function is misleading because it implies that blk_crypto_register()
needs to be paired with blk_crypto_unregister(), which is not the case.
Just set disk->queue->crypto_profile to NULL directly.
