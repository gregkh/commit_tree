Drivers: hv: Fix definition of hypercall input & output arg variables

The percpu variables hyperv_pcpu_input_arg and hyperv_pcpu_output_arg
have been incorrectly defined since their inception.  The __percpu
qualifier should be associated with the void * (i.e., a pointer), not
with the target of the pointer. This distinction makes no difference
to gcc and the generated code, but sparse correctly complains.  Fix
the definitions in the interest of general correctness in addition
to making sparse happy.

No functional change.
