signal: In get_signal test for signal_group_exit every time through the loop

Recently while investigating a problem with rr and signals I noticed
that siglock is dropped in ptrace_signal and get_signal does not jump
to relock.

Looking farther to see if the problem is anywhere else I see that
do_signal_stop also returns if signal_group_exit is true.  I believe
that test can now never be true, but it is a bit hard to trace
through and be certain.

Testing signal_group_exit is not expensive, so move the test for
signal_group_exit into the for loop inside of get_signal to ensure
the test is never skipped improperly.

This has been a potential problem since I added the test for
signal_group_exit was added.
