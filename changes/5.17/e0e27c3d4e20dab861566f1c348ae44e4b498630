cpufreq: qcom-hw: Fix probable nested interrupt handling

Re-enabling an interrupt from its own interrupt handler may cause
an interrupt storm, if there is a pending interrupt and because its
handling is disabled due to already done entrance into the handler
above in the stack.

Also, apparently it is improper to lock a mutex in an interrupt contex.
