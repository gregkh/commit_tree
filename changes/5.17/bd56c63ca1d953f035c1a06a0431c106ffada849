drm/i915: Test all device memory on probing

This extends the previous sanitychecking of device memory to read/write
all the memory on the device during the device probe, ala memtest86,
as an optional module parameter: i915.memtest=1. This is not expected to
be fast, but a reasonably thorough verfification that the device memory
is accessible and doesn't return bit errors.

v2: Rebased.
