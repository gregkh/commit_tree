drm/vc4: hdmi: Introduce an output_enabled flag

We currently poke at encoder->crtc in the ALSA code path to determine
whether the HDMI output is enabled or not, and thus whether we should
allow the audio output.

However, that pointer is deprecated and shouldn't really be used by
atomic drivers anymore. Since we have the infrastructure in place now,
let's just create a flag that we toggle to report whether the controller
is currently enabled and use that instead of encoder->crtc in ALSA.
