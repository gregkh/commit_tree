btrfs: allow generic_bin_search() to take low boundary as an argument

Right now generic_bin_search() always uses a low boundary slot of 0, but
in the next patch we'll want to often skip slot 0 when searching for a
key. So make generic_bin_search() have the low boundary slot specified
as an argument, and move the check for the extent buffer level from
btrfs_bin_search() to generic_bin_search() to avoid adding another
wrapper around generic_bin_search().
