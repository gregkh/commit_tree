exit: Stop poorly open coding do_task_dead in make_task_dead

When the kernel detects it is oops or otherwise force killing a task
while it exits the code poorly attempts to permanently stop the task
from scheduling.

I say poorly because it is possible for a task in TASK_UINTERRUPTIBLE
to be woken up.

As it makes no sense for the task to continue call do_task_dead
instead which actually does the work and permanently removes the task
from the scheduler.  Guaranteeing the task will never be woken
up again.
