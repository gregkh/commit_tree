riscv: extable: fix err reg writing in dedicated uaccess handler

Mayuresh reported commit 20802d8d477d ("riscv: extable: add a dedicated
uaccess handler") breaks the writev02 test case in LTP. This is due to
the err reg isn't correctly set with the errno(-EFAULT in writev02
case). First of all, the err and zero regs are reg numbers rather than
reg offsets in struct pt_regs; Secondly, regs_set_gpr() should write
the regs when offset isn't zero(zero means epc)

Fix it by correcting regs_set_gpr() logic and passing the correct reg
offset to it.
