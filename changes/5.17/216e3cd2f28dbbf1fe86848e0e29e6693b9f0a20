bpf: Add MEM_RDONLY for helper args that are pointers to rdonly mem.

Some helper functions may modify its arguments, for example,
bpf_d_path, bpf_get_stack etc. Previously, their argument types
were marked as ARG_PTR_TO_MEM, which is compatible with read-only
mem types, such as PTR_TO_RDONLY_BUF. Therefore it's legitimate,
but technically incorrect, to modify a read-only memory by passing
it into one of such helper functions.

This patch tags the bpf_args compatible with immutable memory with
MEM_RDONLY flag. The arguments that don't have this flag will be
only compatible with mutable memory types, preventing the helper
from modifying a read-only memory. The bpf_args that have
MEM_RDONLY are compatible with both mutable memory and immutable
memory.
