dpaa2-eth: Initialize mutex used in one step timestamping path

1588 Single Step Timestamping code path uses a mutex to
enforce atomicity for two events:
- update of ptp single step register
- transmit ptp event packet

Before this patch the mutex was not initialized. This
caused unexpected crashes in the Tx function.
