tee: fix put order in teedev_close_context()

Prior to this patch was teedev_close_context() calling tee_device_put()
before teedev_ctx_put() leading to teedev_ctx_release() accessing
ctx->teedev just after the reference counter was decreased on the
teedev. Fix this by calling teedev_ctx_put() before tee_device_put().
