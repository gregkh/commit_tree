MIPS: Loongson2ef: Remove unnecessary {as,cc}-option calls

When building with LLVM's integrated assembler, the build errors because
it does not implement -mfix-loongson2f-{jump,nop}:

arch/mips/loongson2ef/Platform:36: *** only binutils >= 2.20.2 have needed option -mfix-loongson2f-nop.  Stop.

The error is a little misleading because binutils are not being used in
this case.

To clear this up, remove the as-option calls because binutils 2.23 is
the minimum supported version for building the kernel. At the same time,
remove the cc-option calls for the '-march=' flags, as GCC 5.1.0 is the
minimum supported version.

This change will not fix the LLVM build for CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON2{E,F},
as it does not implement the loongson2{e,f} march arguments (nor r4600,
so it will error prior to this change) nor the assembler flags mentioned
above but it will make the errors more obvious.
