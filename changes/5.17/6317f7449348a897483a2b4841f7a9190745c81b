ALSA: hda: Fix regression on forced probe mask option

The forced probe mask via probe_mask 0x100 bit doesn't work any longer
as expected since the bus init code was moved and it's clearing the
codec_mask value that was set beforehand.  This patch fixes the
long-time regression by moving the check_probe_mask() call.
