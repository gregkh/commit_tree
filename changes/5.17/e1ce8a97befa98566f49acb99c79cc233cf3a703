on.  The pointer is redundant and can be removed.  Cleans up scan-build
static analysis warning:

  fs/nilfs2/page.c:203:8: warning: Although the value stored to 'sbufs'
    is used in the enclosing expression, the value is never actually read
    from 'sbufs' [deadcode.DeadStores]
        sbh = sbufs = page_buffers(src);
