fbcon: Add option to enable legacy hardware acceleration

Add a config option CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_LEGACY_ACCELERATION to
enable bitblt and fillrect hardware acceleration in the framebuffer
console. If disabled, such acceleration will not be used, even if it is
supported by the graphics hardware driver.

If you plan to use DRM as your main graphics output system, you should
disable this option since it will prevent compiling in code which isn't
used later on when DRM takes over.

For all other configurations, e.g. if none of your graphic cards support
DRM (yet), DRM isn't available for your architecture, or you can't be
sure that the graphic card in the target system will support DRM, you
most likely want to enable this option.

In the non-accelerated case (e.g. when DRM is used), the inlined
fb_scrollmode() function is hardcoded to return SCROLL_REDRAW and as such the
compiler is able to optimize much unneccesary code away.

In this v3 patch version I additionally changed the GETVYRES() and GETVXRES()
macros to take a pointer to the fbcon_display struct. This fixes the build when
console rotation is enabled and helps the compiler again to optimize out code.
