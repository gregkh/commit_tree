KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Switch PMU to guest as late as possible

This moves PMU switch to guest as late as possible in entry, and switch
back to host as early as possible at exit. This helps the host get the
most perf coverage of KVM entry/exit code as possible.

This is slightly suboptimal for SPR scheduling point of view when the
PMU is enabled, but when perf is disabled there is no real difference.
