selftests/sparc64: remove ARRAY_SIZE define from adi-test

ARRAY_SIZE is defined in several selftests. Remove definition from
individual test files and include header file for the define instead.
ARRAY_SIZE define is added in a separate patch to prepare for this
change.

Remove ARRAY_SIZE from adi-test and pickup the one defined in
kselftest.h.
