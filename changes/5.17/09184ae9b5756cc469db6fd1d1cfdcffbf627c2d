binder: defer copies of pre-patched txn data

BINDER_TYPE_PTR objects point to memory areas in the
source process to be copied into the target buffer
as part of a transaction. This implements a scatter-
gather model where non-contiguous memory in a source
process is "gathered" into a contiguous region in
the target buffer.

The data can include pointers that must be fixed up
to correctly point to the copied data. To avoid making
source process pointers visible to the target process,
this patch defers the copy until the fixups are known
and then copies and fixeups are done together.

There is a special case of BINDER_TYPE_FDA which applies
the fixup later in the target process context. In this
case the user data is skipped (so no untranslated fds
become visible to the target).
