powerpc/code-patching: Improve verification of patchability

Today, patch_instruction() assumes that it is called exclusively on
valid addresses, and only checks that it is not called on an init
address after init section has been freed.

Improve verification by calling kernel_text_address() instead.

kernel_text_address() already includes a verification of
initmem release.
