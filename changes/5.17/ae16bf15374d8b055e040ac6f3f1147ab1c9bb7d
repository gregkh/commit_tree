ibmvnic: init init_done_rc earlier

We currently initialize the ->init_done completion/return code fields
before issuing a CRQ_INIT command. But if we get a transport event soon
after registering the CRQ the taskslet may already have recorded the
completion and error code. If we initialize here, we might overwrite/
lose that and end up issuing the CRQ_INIT only to timeout later.

If that timeout happens during probe, we will leave the adapter in the
DOWN state rather than retrying to register/init the CRQ.

Initialize the completion before registering the CRQ so we don't lose
the notification.
