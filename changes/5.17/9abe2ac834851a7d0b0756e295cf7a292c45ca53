iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Fix table descriptor paddr formatting

Table descriptors were being installed without properly formatting the
address using paddr_to_iopte, which does not match up with the
iopte_deref in __arm_lpae_map. This is incorrect for the LPAE pte
format, as it does not handle the high bits properly.

This was found on Apple T6000 DARTs, which require a new pte format
(different shift); adding support for that to
paddr_to_iopte/iopte_to_paddr caused it to break badly, as even <48-bit
addresses would end up incorrect in that case.
