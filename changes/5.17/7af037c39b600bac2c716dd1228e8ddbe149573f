net: stmmac: dump gmac4 DMA registers correctly

Unlike gmac100, gmac1000, gmac4 has 27 DMA registers and they are
located at DMA_CHAN_BASE_ADDR (0x1100). In order for ethtool to dump
gmac4 DMA registers correctly, this commit checks if a net_device has
gmac4 and uses different logic to dump its DMA registers.

This fixes the following KASAN warning, which can normally be triggered
by a command similar like "ethtool -d eth0":

BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in dwmac4_dump_dma_regs+0x6d4/0xb30
