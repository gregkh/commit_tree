i2c: i801: Don't silently correct invalid transfer size

If an invalid block size is provided, reject it instead of silently
changing it to a supported value. Especially critical I see the case of
a write transfer with block length 0. In this case we have no guarantee
that the byte we would write is valid. When silently reducing a read to
32 bytes then we don't return an error and the caller may falsely
assume that we returned the full requested data.

If this change should break any (broken) caller, then I think we should
fix the caller.
