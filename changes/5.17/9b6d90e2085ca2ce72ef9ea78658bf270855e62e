ata: pata_platform: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in __pata_platform_probe()

In __pata_platform_probe(), devm_kzalloc() is assigned to ap->ops and
there is a dereference of it right after that, which could introduce a
NULL pointer dereference bug.

Fix this by adding a NULL check of ap->ops.

This bug was found by a static analyzer.

Builds with 'make allyesconfig' show no new warnings,
and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.
