mm/slub: Define struct slab fields for CONFIG_SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL only when enabled

The fields 'next' and 'slabs' are only used when CONFIG_SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL
is enabled. We can put their definition to #ifdef to prevent accidental
use when disabled.

Currenlty show_slab_objects() and slabs_cpu_partial_show() contain code
accessing the slabs field that's effectively dead with
CONFIG_SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL=n through the wrappers slub_percpu_partial() and
slub_percpu_partial_read_once(), but to prevent a compile error, we need
to hide all this code behind #ifdef.
