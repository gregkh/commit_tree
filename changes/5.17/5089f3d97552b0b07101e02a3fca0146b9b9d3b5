SUNRPC: Remove low signal-to-noise tracepoints

I'm about to add more information to the server-side SUNRPC
tracepoints, so I'm going to offset the increased trace log
consumption by getting rid of some tracepoints that fire frequently
but don't offer much value.

trace_svc_xprt_received() was useful for debugging, perhaps, but
is not generally informative.

trace_svc_handle_xprt() reports largely the same information as
trace_svc_xdr_recvfrom().

As a clean-up, rename trace_svc_xprt_do_enqueue() to match
svc_xprt_dequeue().
