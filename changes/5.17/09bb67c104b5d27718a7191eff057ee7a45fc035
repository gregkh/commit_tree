soc: qcom: rpmhpd: Rename rpmhpd struct names

The rpmhpd structs were named with a SoC-name prefix, but then
they got reused across multiple SoC families making things confusing.
Rename all the struct names to remove SoC-name prefixes.
While we do this we end up with some power-domains without parents,
and some with and at times different parents across SoCs.
use a _w_<parent-name>_parent suffix for such cases.
No functional change as part of this patch.
