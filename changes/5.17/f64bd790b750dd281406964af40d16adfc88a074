ACPI: Keep sub-table parsing infrastructure available for modules

The NFIT driver and now the CXL ACPI driver have both open-coded ACPI
table parsing. Before another instance is added arrange for the core
ACPI sub-table parsing to be optionally available to drivers via the
CONFIG_ACPI_TABLE_LIB symbol. If no drivers select the symbol then the
infrastructure reverts back to being tagged __init via the
__init_or_acpilib annotation.

For now, only tag the core sub-table routines and data that the CEDT parsing in
the cxl_acpi driver would want to reuse, a CEDT parsing helper is added
in a later change.
