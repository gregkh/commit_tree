block: release rq qos structures for queue without disk

blkcg_init_queue() may add rq qos structures to request queue, previously
blk_cleanup_queue() calls rq_qos_exit() to release them, but commit
8e141f9eb803 ("block: drain file system I/O on del_gendisk")
moves rq_qos_exit() into del_gendisk(), so memory leak is caused
because queues may not have disk, such as un-present scsi luns, nvme
admin queue, ...

Fixes the issue by adding rq_qos_exit() to blk_cleanup_queue() back.

BTW, v5.18 won't need this patch any more since we move
blkcg_init_queue()/blkcg_exit_queue() into disk allocation/release
handler, and patches have been in for-5.18/block.
