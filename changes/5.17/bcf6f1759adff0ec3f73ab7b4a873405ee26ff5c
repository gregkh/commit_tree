ACPI: NUMA: Process hotpluggable memblocks when !CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG

Some systems (e.g. Hyper-V guests) have all their memory marked as
hotpluggable in SRAT. acpi_numa_memory_affinity_init(), however,
ignores all such regions when !CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG and this is
unfortunate as memory affinity (NUMA) information gets lost.

'Hot Pluggable' flag in SRAT only means that "system hardware supports
hot-add and hot-remove of this memory region", it doesn't prevent
memory from being cold-plugged there.

Ignore 'Hot Pluggable' bit instead of skipping the whole memory
affinity information when !CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG.
