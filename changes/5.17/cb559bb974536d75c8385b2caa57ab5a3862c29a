serial: lantiq: store and compare return status correctly

platform_get_irq() returns signed status. It should be stored and
compared as signed value before storing to unsigned variable. Implicit
conversion from signed to unsigned and then comparison with less than
zero is wrong as unsigned value can never be less than zero.
