mtd: spi-nor: spansion: Use manufacturer late_init()

spansion_post_sfdp_fixups() was called regardless if the flash defined
SFDP tables or not. A better place for this kind of parameters init is
in manufacturer's late_init() hook. post_sfdp() should be called only
when SFDP is defined. No functional change in this patch.

Instead of doing the 4b opcodes settings at manufacturer level, thus
also for every flash that will be introduced, this should be done
just where it is needed, per flash. I'll let this for other patch.
