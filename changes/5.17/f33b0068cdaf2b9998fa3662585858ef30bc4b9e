Bluetooth: vhci: Fix checking of msft_opcode

msft_opcode shall be use a vendor ogf (0x3f) but the check was
swifting the bits in the wrong order due to a missing parantesis
over val & 0xffff, but since the code already checks for values over
0xffff it shall not be necessary to perform that operation it now just
removes which makes it work properly when setting opcodes like 0xfce1.
