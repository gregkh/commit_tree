KVM: x86/mmu: Use shadow page role to detect PML-unfriendly pages for L2

Rework make_spte() to query the shadow page's role, specifically whether
or not it's a guest_mode page, a.k.a. a page for L2, when determining if
the SPTE is compatible with PML.  This eliminates a dependency on @vcpu,
with a future goal of being able to create SPTEs without a specific vCPU.
