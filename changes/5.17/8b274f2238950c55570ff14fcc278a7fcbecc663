riscv: Fix is_linear_mapping with recent move of KASAN region

The KASAN region was recently moved between the linear mapping and the
kernel mapping, is_linear_mapping used to check the validity of an
address by using the start of the kernel mapping, which is now wrong.

Fix this by using the maximum size of the physical memory.
