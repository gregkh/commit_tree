HID: magicmouse: set device name when it has been personalized

If the Apple Magic Trackpad 2 has been connected to a Mac, the name
is automatically personalized showing its owner name. For example:
"José Expósito's Trackpad".

When connected through Bluetooth, the personalized name is reported,
however, when connected through USB the generic name is reported.

Set the device name correctly to ensure the same driver settings are
loaded, whether connected via Bluetooth or USB.
