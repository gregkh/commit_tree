nvme: also mark passthrough-only namespaces ready in nvme_update_ns_info

Commit e7d65803e2bb ("nvme-multipath: revalidate paths during rescan")
introduced the NVME_NS_READY flag, which nvme_path_is_disabled() uses
to check if a path can be used or not.  We also need to set this flag
for devices that fail the ZNS feature validation and which are available
through passthrough devices only to that they can be used in multipathing
setups.
