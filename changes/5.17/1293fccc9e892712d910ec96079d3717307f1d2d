net: ieee802154: hwsim: Ensure proper channel selection at probe time

Drivers are expected to set the PHY current_channel and current_page
according to their default state. The hwsim driver is advertising being
configured on channel 13 by default but that is not reflected in its own
internal pib structure. In order to ensure that this driver consider the
current channel as being 13 internally, we at least need to set the
pib->channel field to 13.
