KVM: VMX: Don't do full kick when handling posted interrupt wakeup

When waking vCPUs in the posted interrupt wakeup handling, do exactly
that and no more.  There is no need to kick the vCPU as the wakeup
handler just needs to get the vCPU task running, and if it's in the guest
then it's definitely running.
