ACPICA: Macros: Remove ACPI_PHYSADDR_TO_PTR

ACPICA commit 52abebd410945ec55afb4dd8b7150e8a39b5c960

This macro was only ever used when stuffing pointers into physical
addresses and trying to later reconstruct the pointer, which is
implementation-defined as to whether that can be done. Now that all such
operations are gone, the macro is unused, and should be removed to avoid
such practices being reintroduced.
