net: ipa: add an interconnect dependency

In order to function, the IPA driver very clearly requires the
interconnect framework to be enabled in the kernel configuration.
State that dependency in the Kconfig file.

This became a problem when CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST support was added.
Non-Qualcomm platforms won't necessarily enable CONFIG_INTERCONNECT.
