selftests: mptcp: be more conservative with cookie MPJ limits

Since commit 2843ff6f36db ("mptcp: remote addresses fullmesh"), an
MPTCP client can attempt creating multiple MPJ subflow simultaneusly.

In such scenario the server, when syncookies are enabled, could end-up
accepting incoming MPJ syn even above the configured subflow limit, as
the such limit can be enforced in a reliable way only after the subflow
creation. In case of syncookie, only after the 3rd ack reception.

As a consequence the related self-tests case sporadically fails, as it
verify that the server always accept the expected number of MPJ syn.

Address the issues relaxing the MPJ syn number constrain. Note that the
check on the accepted number of MPJ 3rd ack still remains intact.
