tps6598x: clear int mask on probe failure

The interrupt mask is enabled before any potential failure points in
the driver, which can leave a failure path where we exit with
interrupts enabled but the device not live. This causes an infinite
stream of interrupts on an Apple M1 Pro laptop on USB-C.

Add a failure label that's used post enabling interrupts, where we
mask them again before returning an error.
