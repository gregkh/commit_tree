tracing: Add helper functions to simplify event_command.parse() callback handling

The event_command.parse() callback is responsible for parsing and
registering triggers.  The existing command implementions for this
callback duplicate a lot of the same code, so to clean up and
consolidate those implementations, introduce a handful of helper
functions for implementors to use.

This also makes it easier for new commands to be implemented and
allows them to focus more on the customizations they provide rather
than obscuring and complicating it with boilerplate code.
