cpufreq: amd-pstate: Introduce a new AMD P-State driver to support future processors

AMD P-State is the AMD CPU performance scaling driver that introduces a
new CPU frequency control mechanism on AMD Zen based CPU series in Linux
kernel. The new mechanism is based on Collaborative processor
performance control (CPPC) which is finer grain frequency management
than legacy ACPI hardware P-States. Current AMD CPU platforms are using
the ACPI P-states driver to manage CPU frequency and clocks with
switching only in 3 P-states. AMD P-State is to replace the ACPI
P-states controls, allows a flexible, low-latency interface for the
Linux kernel to directly communicate the performance hints to hardware.

AMD P-State leverages the Linux kernel governors such as *schedutil*,
*ondemand*, etc. to manage the performance hints which are provided by CPPC
hardware functionality. The first version for AMD P-State is to support one
of the Zen3 processors, and we will support more in future after we verify
the hardware and SBIOS functionalities.

There are two types of hardware implementations for AMD P-State: one is full
MSR support and another is shared memory support. It can use
X86_FEATURE_CPPC feature flag to distinguish the different types.

Using the new AMD P-State method + kernel governors (*schedutil*,
*ondemand*, ...) to manage the frequency update is the most appropriate
bridge between AMD Zen based hardware processor and Linux kernel, the
processor is able to adjust to the most efficiency frequency according to
the kernel scheduler loading.
