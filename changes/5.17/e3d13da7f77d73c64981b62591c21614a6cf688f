platform/x86: asus-wmi: Fix regression when probing for fan curve control

The fan curve control patches introduced a regression for at least the
TUF FX506 and possibly other TUF series laptops that do not have support
for fan curve control.

As part of the probing process, asus_wmi_evaluate_method_buf is called
to get the factory default fan curve . The WMI management function
returns 0 on certain laptops to indicate lack of fan curve control
instead of ASUS_WMI_UNSUPPORTED_METHOD. This 0 is transformed to
-ENODATA which results in failure when probing.
