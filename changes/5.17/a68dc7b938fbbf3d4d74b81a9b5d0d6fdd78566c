net: dsa: remove cross-chip support for HSR

The cross-chip notifiers for HSR are bypass operations, meaning that
even though all switches in a tree are notified, only the switch
specified in the info structure is targeted.

We can eliminate the unnecessary complexity by deleting the cross-chip
notifier logic and calling the ds->ops straight from port.c.
