clk: samsung: clk-pll: Add support for pll1417x

pll1417x is used in Exynos7885 SoC for top-level integer PLLs.
It is similar enough to pll0822x that practically the same code can
handle both. The difference that's to be noted is that when defining a
pl1417x PLL, the "con" parameter of the PLL macro should be set to the
CON1 register instead of CON3, like this:

    PLL(pll_1417x, CLK_FOUT_SHARED0_PLL, "fout_shared0_pll", "oscclk",
        PLL_LOCKTIME_PLL_SHARED0, PLL_CON0_PLL_SHARED0,
        NULL),
