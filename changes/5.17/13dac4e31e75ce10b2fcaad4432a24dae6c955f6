powerpc/8xx: Activate KUEP at all time

On the 8xx, there is absolutely no runtime impact with KUEP. Protection
against execution of user code in kernel mode is set up at boot time
by configuring the groups with contain all user pages as having swapped
protection rights, in extenso EX for user and NA for supervisor.

Configure KUEP at startup and force selection of CONFIG_PPC_KUEP.
