KVM: s390: gaccess: Refactor access address range check

Do not round down the first address to the page boundary, just translate
it normally, which gives the value we care about in the first place.
Given this, translating a single address is just the special case of
translating a range spanning a single page.

Make the output optional, so the function can be used to just check a
range.
