kthread: Warn about failed allocations for the init kthread

Failed allocates are not expected when setting up the initial task and
it is not really possible to handle them either.  So I added a warning
to report if such an allocation failure ever happens.

Correct the sense of the warning so it warns when an allocation failure
happens not when the allocation succeeded.  Oops.
