Input: ti_am335x_tsc - lower the X and Y sampling time

The open delay time has to be applied only on the first sample of the
X/Y coordinates because on the following samples the ADC channel is not
changed. Removing this time from the samples after the first one,
"ti,coordinate-readouts" greater than 1, decreases the total acquisition
time, allowing to increase the number of acquired coordinates in the time
unit.
