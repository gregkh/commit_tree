phy: xilinx: zynqmp: Fix bus width setting for SGMII

TX_PROT_BUS_WIDTH and RX_PROT_BUS_WIDTH are single registers with
separate bit fields for each lane. The code in xpsgtr_phy_init_sgmii was
not preserving the existing register value for other lanes, so enabling
the PHY in SGMII mode on one lane zeroed out the settings for all other
lanes, causing other PS-GTR peripherals such as USB3 to malfunction.

Use xpsgtr_clr_set to only manipulate the desired bits in the register.
