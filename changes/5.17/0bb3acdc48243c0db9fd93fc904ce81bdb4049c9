btrfs: update SCRUB_MAX_PAGES_PER_BLOCK

Use BTRFS_MAX_METADATA_BLOCKSIZE and SZ_4K (minimal sectorsize) to
calculate this value.

And remove one stale comment on the value, in fact with recent subpage
support, BTRFS_MAX_METADATA_BLOCKSIZE * PAGE_SIZE is already beyond
BTRFS_STRIPE_LEN, just we don't use the full page.

Also since we're here, update the BUG_ON() related to
SCRUB_MAX_PAGES_PER_BLOCK to ASSERT().

As those ASSERT() are really only for developers to catch early obvious
bugs, not to let end users suffer.
