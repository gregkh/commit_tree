drm/cma-helper: Set VM_DONTEXPAND for mmap

drm_gem_cma_mmap() cannot assume every implementation of dma_mmap_wc()
will end up calling remap_pfn_range() (which happens to set the relevant
vma flag, among others), so in order to make sure expectations around
VM_DONTEXPAND are met, let it explicitly set the flag like most other
GEM mmap implementations do.

This avoids repeated warnings on a small minority of systems where the
display is behind an IOMMU, and has a simple driver which does not
override drm_gem_cma_default_funcs. Arm hdlcd is an in-tree affected
driver. Out-of-tree, the Apple DCP driver is affected; this fix is
required for DCP to be mainlined.
