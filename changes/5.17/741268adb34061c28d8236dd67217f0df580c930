Bluetooth: btusb: re-definition for board_id in struct qca_version

The board ID should be split into two bytes.
The 1st byte is chip ID, and the 2nd byte is platform ID.
For example, board ID 0x010A, 0x01 is platform ID. 0x0A is chip ID.
we have several platforms, and platform IDs are continuously added.
We would not distinguish different chips if we get these mixed up.
Platform ID:
0x00 is for Mobile
0x01 is for X86
0x02 is for Automotive
0x03 is for Consumer electronic
