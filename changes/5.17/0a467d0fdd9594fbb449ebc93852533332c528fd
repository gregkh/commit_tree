block: switch to atomic_t for request references

refcount_t is not as expensive as it used to be, but it's still more
expensive than the io_uring method of using atomic_t and just checking
for potential over/underflow.

This borrows that same implementation, which in turn is based on the
mm implementation from Linus.
