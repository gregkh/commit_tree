NFSD: Clamp WRITE offsets

Ensure that a client cannot specify a WRITE range that falls in a
byte range outside what the kernel's internal types (such as loff_t,
which is signed) can represent. The kiocb iterators, invoked in
nfsd_vfs_write(), should properly limit write operations to within
the underlying file system's s_maxbytes.
