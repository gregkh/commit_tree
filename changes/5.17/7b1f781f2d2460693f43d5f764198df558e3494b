Input: psmouse - set up dependency between PS/2 and SMBus companions

When we switch from emulated PS/2 to native (RMI4 or Elan) protocols, we
create SMBus companion devices that are attached to I2C/SMBus controllers.
However, when suspending and resuming, we also need to make sure that we
take into account the PS/2 device they are associated with, so that PS/2
device is suspended after the companion and resumed before it, otherwise
companions will not work properly. Before I2C devices were marked for
asynchronous suspend/resume, this ordering happened naturally, but now we
need to enforce it by establishing device links, with PS/2 devices being
suppliers and SMBus companions being consumers.
