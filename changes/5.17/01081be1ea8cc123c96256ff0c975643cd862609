net: prestera: replace zero-length array with flexible-array member

replaced with flexible-array members:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#zero-length-and-one-element-arrays

Replace zero-length array with flexible-array member and make use
of the struct_size() helper.
