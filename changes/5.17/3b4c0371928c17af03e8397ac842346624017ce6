watch_queue: Fix the alloc bitmap size to reflect notes allocated

Currently, watch_queue_set_size() sets the number of notes available in
wqueue->nr_notes according to the number of notes allocated, but sets
the size of the bitmap to the unrounded number of notes originally asked
for.

Fix this by setting the bitmap size to the number of notes we're
actually going to make available (ie. the number allocated).
