rtw89: remove cch_by_bw which is not used

Originally, cch_by_bw recorded center channels of each available
bandwidths under current bandwidth. And the plan was to iterate
cch_by_bw as parameters to query other configurations. However,
we have not used it for the time being. Keeping it will disturb
the follow-up things, such as bandwidth 160 MHz, so we remove it
for now. If it's really needed at some point, we will redesign it.
