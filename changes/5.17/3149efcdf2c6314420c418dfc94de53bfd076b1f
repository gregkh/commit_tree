PCI: hv: Fix NUMA node assignment when kernel boots with custom NUMA topology

When kernel boots with a NUMA topology with some NUMA nodes offline, the PCI
driver should only set an online NUMA node on the device. This can happen
during KDUMP where some NUMA nodes are not made online by the KDUMP kernel.

This patch also fixes the case where kernel is booting with "numa=off".
