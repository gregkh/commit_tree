fs: dlm: remove check SCTP is loaded message

Since commit 764ff4011424 ("fs: dlm: auto load sctp module") we try
load the sctp module before we try to create a sctp kernel socket. That
a socket creation fails now has more likely other reasons. This patch
removes the part of error to load the sctp module and instead printout
the error code.
