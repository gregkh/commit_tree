filemap: Drop the refcount while waiting for page lock

Commit bd8a1f3655a7 ("mm/filemap: support readpage splitting a page")
changed the read_iter path to drop the refcount while waiting for the
page lock.  However, it missed the same pattern in read_mapping_page()
and friends.  Use the same pattern in do_read_cache_folio() that is
used in filemap_update_page().
