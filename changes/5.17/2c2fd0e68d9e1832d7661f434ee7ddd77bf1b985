can: sun4i_can: add support for R40 CAN controller

Allwinner R40 (also known as A40i, T3, V40) has a CAN controller. The
controller is the same as in earlier A10 and A20 SoCs, but needs reset
line to be deasserted before use.

This patch adds a new compatible for R40 CAN controller. Depending
on the compatible, reset line can be requested from DT.
