bpf: Add ingress_ifindex to bpf_sk_lookup

It may be helpful to have access to the ifindex during bpf socket
lookup. An example may be to scope certain socket lookup logic to
specific interfaces, i.e. an interface may be made exempt from custom
lookup code.

Add the ifindex of the arriving connection to the bpf_sk_lookup API.
