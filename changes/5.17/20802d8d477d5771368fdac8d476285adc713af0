riscv: extable: add a dedicated uaccess handler

Inspired by commit 2e77a62cb3a6 ("arm64: extable: add a dedicated
uaccess handler"), do similar to riscv to add a dedicated uaccess
exception handler to update registers in exception context and
subsequently return back into the function which faulted, so we remove
the need for fixups specialized to each faulting instruction.
