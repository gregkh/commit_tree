RISC-V: Use __cpu_up_stack/task_pointer only for spinwait method

The __cpu_up_stack/task_pointer array is only used for spinwait method
now. The per cpu array based lookup is also fragile for platforms with
discontiguous/sparse hartids. The spinwait method is only used for
M-mode Linux or older firmwares without SBI HSM extension. For general
Linux systems, ordered booting method is preferred anyways to support
cpu hotplug and kexec.

Make sure that __cpu_up_stack/task_pointer is only used for spinwait
method. Take this opportunity to rename it to
__cpu_spinwait_stack/task_pointer to emphasize the purpose as well.
