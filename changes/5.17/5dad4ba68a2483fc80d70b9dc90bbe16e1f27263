powerpc/watchdog: Fix missed watchdog reset due to memory ordering race

It is possible for all CPUs to miss the pending cpumask becoming clear,
and then nobody resetting it, which will cause the lockup detector to
stop working. It will eventually expire, but watchdog_smp_panic will
avoid doing anything if the pending mask is clear and it will never be
reset.

Order the cpumask clear vs the subsequent test to close this race.

Add an extra check for an empty pending mask when the watchdog fires and
finds its bit still clear, to try to catch any other possible races or
bugs here and keep the watchdog working. The extra test in
arch_touch_nmi_watchdog is required to prevent the new warning from
firing off.
