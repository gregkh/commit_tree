mmc: core: Use blk_mq_complete_request_direct().

The completion callback for the sdhci-pci device is invoked from a
kworker.
I couldn't identify in which context is mmc_blk_mq_req_done() invoke but
the remaining caller are from invoked from preemptible context. Here it
would make sense to complete the request directly instead scheduling
ksoftirqd for its completion.
