dt-bindings: display: Add SPI peripheral schema to SPI based displays

With 'unevaluatedProperties' support enabled, several SPI based display
binding examples have warnings:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/samsung,ld9040.example.dt.yaml: lcd@0: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('#address-cells', '#size-cells', 'spi-max-frequency', 'spi-cpol', 'spi-cpha' were unexpected)
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/kingdisplay,kd035g6-54nt.example.dt.yaml: panel@0: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('spi-max-frequency', 'spi-3wire' were unexpected)

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/sitronix,st7789v.example.dt.yaml: panel@0: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('spi-max-frequency', 'spi-cpol', 'spi-cpha' were unexpected)

Fix all of these by adding a reference to spi-peripheral-props.yaml.
With this, the description that the binding must follow
spi-controller.yaml is both a bit out of date and redundant, so remove
it.
