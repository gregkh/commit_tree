HID: amd_sfh: Handle amd_sfh work buffer in PM ops

Since in the current amd_sfh design the sensor data is periodically
obtained in the form of poll data, during the suspend/resume cycle,
scheduling a delayed work adds no value.

So, cancel the work and restart back during the suspend/resume cycle
respectively.
