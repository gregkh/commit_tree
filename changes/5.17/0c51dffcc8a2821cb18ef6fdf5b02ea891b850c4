tipc: delete the unlikely branch in tipc_aead_encrypt

When a skb comes to tipc_aead_encrypt(), it's always linear. The
unlikely check 'skb_cloned(skb) && tailen <= skb_tailroom(skb)'
can completely be taken care of in skb_cow_data() by the code
in branch "if (!skb_has_frag_list())".

Also, remove the 'TODO:' annotation, as the pages in skbs are not
writable, see more on commit 3cf4375a0904 ("tipc: do not write
skb_shinfo frags when doing decrytion").
