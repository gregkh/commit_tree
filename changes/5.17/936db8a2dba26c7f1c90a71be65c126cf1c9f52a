net: dsa: rename dsa_port_offloads_bridge to dsa_port_offloads_bridge_dev

Currently the majority of dsa_port_bridge_dev_get() calls in drivers is
just to check whether a port is under the bridge device provided as
argument by the DSA API.

We'd like to change that DSA API so that a more complex structure is
provided as argument. To keep things more generic, and considering that
the new complex structure will be provided by value and not by
reference, direct comparisons between dp->bridge and the provided bridge
will be broken. The generic way to do the checking would simply be to
do something like dsa_port_offloads_bridge(dp, &bridge).

But there's a problem, we already have a function named that way, which
actually takes a bridge_dev net_device as argument. Rename it so that we
can use dsa_port_offloads_bridge for something else.
