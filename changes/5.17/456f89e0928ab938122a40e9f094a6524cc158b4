KVM: selftests: aarch64: Skip tests if we can't create a vgic-v3

The arch_timer and vgic_irq kselftests assume that they can create a
vgic-v3, using the library function vgic_v3_setup() which aborts with a
test failure if it is not possible to do so. Since vgic-v3 can only be
instantiated on systems where the host has GICv3 this leads to false
positives on older systems where that is not the case.

Fix this by changing vgic_v3_setup() to return an error if the vgic can't
be instantiated and have the callers skip if this happens. We could also
exit flagging a skip in vgic_v3_setup() but this would prevent future test
cases conditionally deciding which GIC to use or generally doing more
complex output.
