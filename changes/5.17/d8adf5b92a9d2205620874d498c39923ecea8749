scripts/dtc: dtx_diff: remove broken example from help text

dtx_diff suggests to use <(...) syntax to pipe two inputs into it, but
this has never worked: The /proc/self/fds/... paths passed by the shell
will fail the `[ -f "${dtx}" ] && [ -r "${dtx}" ]` check in compile_to_dts,
but even with this check removed, the function cannot work: hexdump will
eat up the DTB magic, making the subsequent dtc call fail, as a pipe
cannot be rewound.

Simply remove this broken example, as there is already an alternative one
that works fine.
