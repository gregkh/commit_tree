media: imx-pxp: Initialize the spinlock prior to using it

After devm_request_threaded_irq() is called there is a chance that an
interrupt may occur before the spinlock is initialized, which will trigger
a kernel oops.

To prevent that, move the initialization of the spinlock prior to
requesting the interrupts.
