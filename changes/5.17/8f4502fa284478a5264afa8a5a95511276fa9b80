drm/virtio: fix potential integer overflow on shift of a int

The left shift of unsigned int 32 bit integer constant 1 is evaluated
using 32 bit arithmetic and then assigned to a signed 64 bit integer.
In the case where i is 32 or more this can lead to an overflow. Fix
this by shifting the value 1ULL instead.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitentional integer overflow")
