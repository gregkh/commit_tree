perf/x86/rapl: fix AMD event handling

The RAPL events exposed under /sys/devices/power/events should only reflect
what the underlying hardware actually support. This is how it works on Intel
RAPL and Intel core/uncore PMUs in general.
But on AMD, this was not the case. All possible RAPL events were advertised.

This is what it showed on an AMD Fam17h:
$ ls /sys/devices/power/events/
energy-cores        energy-gpu          energy-pkg          energy-psys
energy-ram          energy-cores.scale  energy-gpu.scale    energy-pkg.scale
energy-psys.scale   energy-ram.scale    energy-cores.unit   energy-gpu.unit
energy-pkg.unit     energy-psys.unit    energy-ram.unit

Yet, on AMD Fam17h, only energy-pkg is supported.

This patch fixes the problem. Given the way perf_msr_probe() works, the
amd_rapl_msrs[] table has to have all entries filled out and in particular
the group field, otherwise perf_msr_probe() defaults to making the event
visible.

With the patch applied, the kernel now only shows was is actually supported:

$ ls /sys/devices/power/events/
energy-pkg  energy-pkg.scale  energy-pkg.unit

The patch also uses the RAPL_MSR_MASK because only the 32-bits LSB of the
RAPL counters are relevant when reading power consumption.
