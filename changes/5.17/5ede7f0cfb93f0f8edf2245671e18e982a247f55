Input: goodix - add pen support

Some Goodix touchscreens have support for a (Goodix) active pen, add
support for this. The info on how to detect when a pen is down and to
detect when the stylus buttons are pressed was lifted from the out
of tree Goodix driver with pen support written by Adya:
https://gitlab.com/AdyaAdya/goodix-touchscreen-linux-driver/

Since there is no way to tell if pen support is present, the registering
of the pen input_dev is delayed till the first pen event is detected.

This has been tested on a Trekstor Surftab duo W1, a Chuwi Hi13 and
a Cyberbook T116 tablet.
