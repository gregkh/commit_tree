nl82011: clarify interface combinations wrt. channels

Thinking about MLD (Draft 802.11be) now, it's clear that
we'll have new limitations where different stations (or
links) must be on _different_ channels (or in different
frequency ranges even.) Clarify that the current limit of
multiple channels is a maximum and the same one is OK.
