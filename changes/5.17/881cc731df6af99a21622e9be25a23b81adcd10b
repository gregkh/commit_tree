net: phy: Fix qca8081 with speeds lower than 2.5Gb/s

A typo in qca808x_read_status means we try to set SMII mode on the port
rather than SGMII when the link speed is not 2.5Gb/s. This results in no
traffic due to the mismatch in configuration between the phy and the
mac.

v2:
 Only change interface mode when the link is up
