media: atomisp: add missing media_device_cleanup() in atomisp_unregister_entities()

After the commit 9832e155f1ed ("[media] media-device: split media
initialization and registration"), calling media_device_cleanup()
is needed it seems. However, currently it is missing for the module
unload path.

Note that for the probe failure path, it is already added in
atomisp_register_entities().

This patch adds the missing call of media_device_cleanup() in
atomisp_unregister_entities().
