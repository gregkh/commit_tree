bpftool: Refactor misc. feature probe

There is currently a single miscellaneous feature probe,
HAVE_LARGE_INSN_LIMIT, to check for the 1M instructions limit in the
verifier. Subsequent patches will add additional miscellaneous probes,
which follow the same pattern at the existing probe. This patch
therefore refactors the probe to avoid code duplication in subsequent
patches.

The BPF program type and the checked error numbers in the
HAVE_LARGE_INSN_LIMIT probe are changed to better generalize to other
probes. The feature probe retains its current behavior despite those
changes.
