qed: Use the bitmap API to simplify some functions

'cid_map' is a bitmap. So use 'bitmap_zalloc()' to simplify code,
improve the semantic and avoid some open-coded arithmetic in allocator
arguments.

Also change the corresponding 'kfree()' into 'bitmap_free()' to keep
consistency.

Also change some 'memset()' into 'bitmap_zero()' to keep consistency. This
is also much less verbose.
