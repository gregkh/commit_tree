PCI: mvebu: Set PCI Bridge Class Code to PCI Bridge

The default value of Class Code of this bridge corresponds to a Memory
controller, though. This is probably relict from the past when old
Marvell/Galileo PCI-based controllers were used as standalone PCI device
for connecting SDRAM or workaround for PCs with broken BIOS. Details are
in commit 36de23a4c5f0 ("MIPS: Cobalt: Explain GT64111 early PCI fixup").

Change the Class Code to correspond to a PCI Bridge.

Add comment explaining this change.
