arm64: dts: meson-gxbb-wetek: fix missing GPIO binding

The absence of this binding appears to be harmless in Linux but it breaks
Ethernet support in mainline u-boot. So add the binding (which is present
in all other u-boot supported GXBB device-trees).

Fixes: fb72c03e0e32 ("ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb-wetek: add a wetek specific dtsi to cleanup hub and play2")
