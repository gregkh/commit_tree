drm/amdgpu: introduce a kind of halt state for amdgpu device

It is useful to maintain error context when debugging
SW/FW issues. Introduce amdgpu_device_halt() for this
purpose. It will bring hardware to a kind of halt state,
so that no one can touch it any more.

Compare to a simple hang, the system will keep stable
at least for SSH access. Then it should be trivial to
inspect the hardware state and see what's going on.

v2:
 - Set adev->no_hw_access earlier to avoid potential crashes.(Christian)
