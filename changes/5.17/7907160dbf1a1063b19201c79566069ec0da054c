KVM: nSVM: rename nested_load_control_from_vmcb12 in nested_copy_vmcb_control_to_cache

Following the same naming convention of the previous patch,
rename nested_load_control_from_vmcb12.
In addition, inline copy_vmcb_control_area as it is only called
by this function.

__nested_copy_vmcb_control_to_cache() works with vmcb_control_area
parameters and it will be useful in next patches, when we use
local variables instead of svm cached state.
