drm/i915: Add support for panels with VESA backlights with PWM enable/disable

This simply adds proper support for panel backlights that can be controlled
via VESA's backlight control protocol, but which also require that we
enable and disable the backlight via PWM instead of via the DPCD interface.
We also enable this by default, in order to fix some people's backlights
that were broken by not having this enabled.

For reference, backlights that require this and use VESA's backlight
interface tend to be laptops with hybrid GPUs, but this very well may
change in the future.

v4:
* Make sure that we call intel_backlight_level_to_pwm() in
  intel_dp_aux_vesa_enable_backlight() - vsyrjala
