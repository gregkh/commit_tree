iwlwifi: don't pass actual WGDS revision number in table_revision

The FW API for PER_CHAIN_LIMIT_OFFSET_CMD is misleading.  The element
name is table_rev, but it shouldn't actually contain the table
revision number, but whether we should use the South Korea scheme or
not.

Fix the driver so that we only set this value to either 0 or 1.  It
will only be 1 (meaning South Korea) if the ACPI WGDS table revision
is 1.
