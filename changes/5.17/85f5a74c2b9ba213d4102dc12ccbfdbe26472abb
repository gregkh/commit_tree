block: Add bio_add_folio()

This is a thin wrapper around bio_add_page().  The main advantage here
is the documentation that folios larger than 2GiB are not supported.
It's not currently possible to allocate folios that large, but if it
ever becomes possible, this function will fail gracefully instead of
doing I/O to the wrong bytes.
