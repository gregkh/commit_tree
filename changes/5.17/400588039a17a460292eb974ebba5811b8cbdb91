ath11k: add branch predictors in process_rx

In datapath, add branch predictors where required in the process rx().
This protects high value rx path without having performance overhead.
Also while processing rx packets, the pointer that is returned by
rcu_dereference() is not dereferenced. so it is preferable to use
rcu_access_pointer() here.
