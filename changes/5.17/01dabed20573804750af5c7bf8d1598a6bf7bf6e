selftests/zram: Adapt the situation that /dev/zram0 is being used

If zram-generator package is installed and works, then we can not remove
zram module because zram swap is being used. This case needs a clean zram
environment, change this test by using hot_add/hot_remove interface. So
even zram device is being used, we still can add zram device and remove
them in cleanup.

The two interface was introduced since kernel commit 6566d1a32bf7("zram:
add dynamic device add/remove functionality") in v4.2-rc1. If kernel
supports these two interface, we use hot_add/hot_remove to slove this
problem, if not, just check whether zram is being used or built in, then
skip it on old kernel.
