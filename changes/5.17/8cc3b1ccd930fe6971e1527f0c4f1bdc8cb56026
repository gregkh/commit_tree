fanotify: wire up FAN_RENAME event

FAN_RENAME is the successor of FAN_MOVED_FROM and FAN_MOVED_TO
and can be used to get the old and new parent+name information in
a single event.

FAN_MOVED_FROM and FAN_MOVED_TO are still supported for backward
compatibility, but it makes little sense to use them together with
FAN_RENAME in the same group.

FAN_RENAME uses special info type records to report the old and
new parent+name, so reporting only old and new parent id is less
useful and was not implemented.
Therefore, FAN_REANAME requires a group with flag FAN_REPORT_NAME.
