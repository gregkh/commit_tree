phy: dphy: Correct clk_pre parameter

The D-PHY specification (v1.2) explicitly mentions that the T-CLK-PRE
parameter's unit is Unit Interval(UI) and the minimum value is 8.  Also,
kernel doc of the 'clk_pre' member of struct phy_configure_opts_mipi_dphy
mentions that it should be in UI.  However, the dphy core driver wrongly
sets 'clk_pre' to 8000, which seems to hint that it's in picoseconds.

So, let's fix the dphy core driver to correctly reflect the T-CLK-PRE
parameter's minimum value according to the D-PHY specification.

I'm assuming that all impacted custom drivers shall program values in
TxByteClkHS cycles into hardware for the T-CLK-PRE parameter.  The D-PHY
specification mentions that the frequency of TxByteClkHS is exactly 1/8
the High-Speed(HS) bit rate(each HS bit consumes one UI).  So, relevant
custom driver code is changed to program those values as
DIV_ROUND_UP(cfg->clk_pre, BITS_PER_BYTE), then.

Note that I've only tested the patch with RM67191 DSI panel on i.MX8mq EVK.
Help is needed to test with other i.MX8mq, Meson and Rockchip platforms,
as I don't have the hardwares.
