bpftool: Use libbpf_get_error() to check error

Currently, LIBBPF_STRICT_ALL mode is enabled by default for
bpftool which means on error cases, some libbpf APIs would
return NULL pointers. This makes IS_ERR check failed to detect
such cases and result in segfault error. Use libbpf_get_error()
instead like we do in libbpf itself.
