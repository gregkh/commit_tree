habanalabs: adding indication of boot fit loaded

Up until now the driver stored indication if Linux was loaded on the
device CPU. This was needed in order to coordinate some tasks that are
performed by the Linux.

In future ASICs, many of those tasks will be performed by the boot
fit, so now we need the same indication of boot fit load status.
