iwlwifi: mvm: fix condition which checks the version of rate_n_flags

We're checking the FW version of TX_CMD in order to decide whether to
convert rate_n_flags from the old format to the new one.  If the API
is smaller or equal to 6 we should convert it.  Currently we're
converting if the API version is greater than 6. Fix it.
