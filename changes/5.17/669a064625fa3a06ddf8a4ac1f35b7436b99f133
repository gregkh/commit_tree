block: drop needless assignment in set_task_ioprio()

Commit 5fc11eebb4a9 ("block: open code create_task_io_context in
set_task_ioprio") introduces a needless assignment
'ioc = task->io_context', as the local variable ioc is not further
used before returning.

Even after the further fix, commit a957b61254a7 ("block: fix error in
handling dead task for ioprio setting"), the assignment still remains
needless.

Drop this needless assignment in set_task_ioprio().

This code smell was identified with 'make clang-analyzer'.
