staging: greybus: auto_manager: use default_groups in kobj_type

There are currently 2 ways to create a set of sysfs files for a
kobj_type, through the default_attrs field, and the default_groups
field.  Move the greybus audio code to use default_groups field which
has been the preferred way since aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add support for
default attribute groups to kobj_type") so that we can soon get rid of
the obsolete default_attrs field.
