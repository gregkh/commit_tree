ath11k: Clear auth flag only for actual association in security mode

AUTH flag is needed when peer assoc command is sent from host in
security mode for non-assoc cases. Firmware will handle AUTH flag
when client is associating as AUTH flag will be set after key exchange.
For internally provided peer assoc commands from host, there won't be
any key exchange, so AUTH flag is expected to be set in host.

Tested-on: QCN9074 hw1.0 PCI WLAN.HK.2.4.0.1-01838-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
