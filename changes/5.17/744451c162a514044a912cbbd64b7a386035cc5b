Bluetooth: hci_sync: Push sync command cancellation to workqueue

syzbot reported that hci_cmd_sync_cancel may sleep from the wrong
context. To avoid this, create a new work item that pushes the relevant
parts into a different context.

Note that we keep the old implementation with the name
__hci_cmd_sync_cancel as the sleeping behaviour is desired in some
cases.
