ext4: fix fast commit may miss tracking range for FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE

when call falloc with FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE, to set an range to unwritten,
which has been already initialized. If the range is align to blocksize,
fast commit will not track range for this change.

Also track range for unwritten range in ext4_map_blocks().
