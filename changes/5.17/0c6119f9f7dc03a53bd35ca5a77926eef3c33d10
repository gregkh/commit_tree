tty: add kernel-doc for tty_ldisc_ops

tty_ldisc_ops structure was already partially documented in a standalone
comment in the header beginning.

Move it right before the structure and reformat it so it complies to
kernel-doc. That way, we can include it in Documentation/ later in this
series.

And add the documentation for the members where missing too.
