drm/vc4: Increase the core clock based on HVS load

Depending on a given HVS output (HVS to PixelValves) and input (planes
attached to a channel) load, the HVS needs for the core clock to be
raised above its boot time default.

Failing to do so will result in a vblank timeout and a stalled display
pipeline.
