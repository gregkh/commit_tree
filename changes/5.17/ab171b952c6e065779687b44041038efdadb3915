fs: move namespace sysctls and declare fs base directory

This moves the namespace sysctls to its own file as part of the
kernel/sysctl.c spring cleaning

Since we have now removed all sysctls for "fs", we now have to declare
it on the filesystem code, we do that using the new helper, which
reduces boiler plate code.

We rename init_fs_shared_sysctls() to init_fs_sysctls() to reflect that
now fs/sysctls.c is taking on the burden of being the first to register
the base directory as well.

Lastly, since init code will load in the order in which we link it we
have to move the sysctl code to be linked in early, so that its early
init routine runs prior to other fs code.  This way, other filesystem
code can register their own sysctls using the helpers after this:

  * register_sysctl_init()
  * register_sysctl()
