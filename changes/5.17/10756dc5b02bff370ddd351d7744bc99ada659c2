usr/include/Makefile: add linux/nfc.h to the compile-test coverage

As linux/nfc.h userspace compilation was finally fixed by commits
79b69a83705e ("nfc: uapi: use kernel size_t to fix user-space builds")
and 7175f02c4e5f ("uapi: fix linux/nfc.h userspace compilation errors"),
there is no need to keep the compile-test exception for it in
usr/include/Makefile.
