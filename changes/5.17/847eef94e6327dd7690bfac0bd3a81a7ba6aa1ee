perf/arm-cmn: Optimise DTM counter reads

When multiple nodes of the same type are connected to the same XP
(particularly in CAL configurations), it seems that they are likely
to be consecutive in logical ID. Therefore, we're likely to gain a
small benefit from an easy tweak to optimise out consecutive reads
of the same set of DTM counters for an aggregated event.
