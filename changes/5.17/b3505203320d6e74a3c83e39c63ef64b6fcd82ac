staging: r8188eu: move SwLedOn and SwLedOff into rtw_led.c

Move the low-level functions SwLedOn and SwLedOff from the hal layer
into rtw_led.c. This is the only place where they're used.

There's no need to go through the hal layer for a simple register access
if the driver supports only a single chipset.
