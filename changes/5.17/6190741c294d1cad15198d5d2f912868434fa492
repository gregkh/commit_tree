perf/arm-cmn: Account for NUMA affinity

On a system with multiple CMN meshes, ideally we'd want to access each
PMU from within its own mesh, rather than with a long CML round-trip,
wherever feasible. Since such a system is likely to be presented as
multiple NUMA nodes, let's also hope a proximity domain is specified
for each CMN programming interface, and use that to guide our choice
of IRQ affinity to favour a node-local CPU where possible.
