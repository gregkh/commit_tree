libbpf: Replace btf__type_by_id() with btf_type_by_id().

To prepare relo_core.c to be compiled in the kernel and the user space
replace btf__type_by_id with btf_type_by_id.

In libbpf btf__type_by_id and btf_type_by_id have different behavior.

bpf_core_apply_relo_insn() needs behavior of uapi btf__type_by_id
vs internal btf_type_by_id, but type_id range check is already done
in bpf_core_apply_relo(), so it's safe to replace it everywhere.
The kernel btf_type_by_id() does the check anyway. It doesn't hurt.
