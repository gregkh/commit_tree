power: supply: ab8500_fg: Init battery data in bind()

We were assigning some battery data state in probe() but
this is insecure as it depends on the proper probe order
between the components: the charger must probe first so
that the battery data is populated. Move the init to
the bind() call which is certain to happen after the
probe of the master and all components has happened.
