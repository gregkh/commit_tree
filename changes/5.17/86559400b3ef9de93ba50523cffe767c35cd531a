rtc: gamecube: Add a RTC driver for the GameCube, Wii and Wii U

These three consoles share a device, the MX23L4005, which contains a
clock and 64 bytes of SRAM storage, and is exposed on the EXI bus
(similar to SPI) on channel 0, device 1.  This driver allows it to be
used as a Linux RTC device, where time can be read and set.

The hardware also exposes two timers, one which shuts down the console
and one which powers it on, but these aren’t supported currently.

On the Wii U, the counter bias is stored in a XML file, /config/rtc.xml,
encrypted in the SLC (eMMC storage), using a proprietary filesystem.  In
order to avoid having to implement all that, this driver assumes a
bootloader will parse this XML file and write the bias into the SRAM, at
the same location the other two consoles have it.
