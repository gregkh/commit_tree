s390/extable: fix exception table sorting

s390 has a swap_ex_entry_fixup function, however it is not being used
since common code expects a swap_ex_entry_fixup define. If it is not
defined the default implementation will be used. So fix this by adding
a proper define.
However also the implementation of the function must be fixed, since a
NULL value for handler has a special meaning and must not be adjusted.

Luckily all of this doesn't fix a real bug currently: the main extable
is correctly sorted during build time, and for runtime sorting there
is currently no case where the handler field is not NULL.
