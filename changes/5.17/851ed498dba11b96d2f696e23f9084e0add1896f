crypto: qat - exchange device capabilities over PFVF

Allow the VF driver to get the supported device capabilities through PFVF,
by adding a new block message, the Capability Summary.

This messages allows to exchange the capability through masks, which
report, depending on the Capability Summary version, up to the following
information:
- algorithms and/or services that are supported by the device (e.g.
  symmetric crypto, data compression, etc.)
- (extended) compression capabilities, with details about the compression
  service (e.g. if compress and verify is supported by this device)
- the frequency of the device

This patch supports the latest Capabilities Summary version 3 for VFs,
but will limit support for the PF driver to version 2. This change also
increases the PFVF protocol to version 2.
