riscv: Implement sv48 support

By adding a new 4th level of page table, give the possibility to 64bit
kernel to address 2^48 bytes of virtual address: in practice, that offers
128TB of virtual address space to userspace and allows up to 64TB of
physical memory.

If the underlying hardware does not support sv48, we will automatically
fallback to a standard 3-level page table by folding the new PUD level into
PGDIR level. In order to detect HW capabilities at runtime, we
use SATP feature that ignores writes with an unsupported mode.
