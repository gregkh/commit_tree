net: bridge: vlan: fix single net device option dumping

When dumping vlan options for a single net device we send the same
entries infinitely because user-space expects a 0 return at the end but
we keep returning skb->len and restarting the dump on retry. Fix it by
returning the value from br_vlan_dump_dev() if it completed or there was
an error. The only case that must return skb->len is when the dump was
incomplete and needs to continue (-EMSGSIZE).
