mm: Convert check_heap_object() to use struct slab

Ensure that we're not seeing a tail page inside __check_heap_object() by
converting to a slab instead of a page.  Take the opportunity to mark
the slab as const since we're not modifying it.  Also move the
declaration of __check_heap_object() to mm/slab.h so it's not available
to the wider kernel.

[ vbabka@suse.cz: in check_heap_object() only convert to struct slab for
  actual PageSlab pages; use folio as intermediate step instead of page ]
