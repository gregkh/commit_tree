counter: Use container_of instead of drvdata to track counter_device

The counter core uses drvdata to find a struct counter_device from a
struct device. However as the device is a member of struct counter_device,
the lookup can be done faster (and a bit type safe) using container_of.

There are no other users of drvdata, so the call to dev_set_drvdata can
go away, too.
