mmc: mtk-sd: Fix usage of devm_clk_get_optional()

If we get an error during probe of an optional clock with function
devm_clk_get_optional(), this means that the clock was provided, but
an error occurred: this has to be escalated to the probe function
for the driver probe to fail accordingly, or unexpected hardware
behavior may happen.
