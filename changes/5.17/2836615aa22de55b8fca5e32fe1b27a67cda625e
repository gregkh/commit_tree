netns: add schedule point in ops_exit_list()

When under stress, cleanup_net() can have to dismantle
netns in big numbers. ops_exit_list() currently calls
many helpers [1] that have no schedule point, and we can
end up with soft lockups, particularly on hosts
with many cpus.

Even for moderate amount of netns processed by cleanup_net()
this patch avoids latency spikes.

[1] Some of these helpers like fib_sync_up() and fib_sync_down_dev()
are very slow because net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c uses host-wide hash tables,
and ifindex is used as the only input of two hash functions.
    ifindexes tend to be the same for all netns (lo.ifindex==1 per instance)
    This will be fixed in a separate patch.
