mlxsw: spectrum_acl_bloom_filter: Reorder functions to make the code more aesthetic

Currently, mlxsw_sp_acl_bf_rule_count_index_get() is implemented before
mlxsw_sp_acl_bf_index_get() but is used after it.

Adding a new function for Spectrum-4 would make them further apart still.
Fix by moving them around.
