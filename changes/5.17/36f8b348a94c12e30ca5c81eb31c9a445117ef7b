checkpatch: relax regexp for COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE

One exceptions to the COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE rule is a file path followed
by ':'.  That is typically some sort diagnostic message from a compiler
or a build tool, in which case we don't want to wrap the lines but keep
the message unmodified.

The regular expression used to match this pattern currently doesn't
accept absolute paths or + characters.  This can result in false
positives as in the following (out-of-tree) example:

  ...
  /home/jerome/work/optee_repo_qemu/build/../toolchains/aarch32/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld.bfd: /home/jerome/work/toolchains-gcc10.2/aarch32/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/10.2.1/../../../../arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/lib/libstdc++.a(eh_alloc.o): in function `__cxa_allocate_exception':
  /tmp/dgboter/bbs/build03--cen7x86_64/buildbot/cen7x86_64--arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/build/src/gcc/libstdc++-v3/libsupc++/eh_alloc.cc:284: undefined reference to `malloc'
  ...

Update the regular expression to match the above paths.
