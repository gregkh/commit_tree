net/mlx5: Bridge, take rtnl lock in init error handler

The mlx5_esw_bridge_cleanup() is expected to be called with rtnl lock
taken, which is true for mlx5e_rep_bridge_cleanup() function but not for
error handling code in mlx5e_rep_bridge_init(). Add missing rtnl
lock/unlock calls and extend both mlx5_esw_bridge_cleanup() and its dual
function mlx5_esw_bridge_init() with ASSERT_RTNL() to verify the invariant
from now on.
