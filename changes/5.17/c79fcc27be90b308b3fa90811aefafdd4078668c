tipc: fix incorrect order of state message data sanity check

When receiving a state message, function tipc_link_validate_msg()
is called to validate its header portion. Then, its data portion
is validated before it can be accessed correctly. However, current
data sanity  check is done after the message header is accessed to
update some link variables.

This commit fixes this issue by moving the data sanity check to
the beginning of state message handling and right after the header
sanity check.
