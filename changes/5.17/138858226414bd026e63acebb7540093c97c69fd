habanalabs: handle abort scenario for user interrupt

In case of device reset, the driver does a force trigger on all waiting
users to release them from waiting. However, the driver does not handle
error scenario while waiting.

hl_interrupt_wait_ioctl() now exits the wait in case of an error with
abort status.
