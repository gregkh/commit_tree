LICENSES/LGPL-2.1: Add LGPL-2.1-or-later as valid identifiers

Some files have been flagged with the new LGPL-2.1-or-later
identifier which replace the original LGPL-2.1+ in the SPDX license
identifier specification, but the identifiers are not mentioned as
valid in the LGPL-2.1 license file.

Add it, together with the LGPL-2.1-only at the the license file.
