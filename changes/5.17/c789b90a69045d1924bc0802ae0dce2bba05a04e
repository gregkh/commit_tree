x86/hyper-v: Add hyperv Isolation VM check in the cc_platform_has()

Hyper-V provides Isolation VM for confidential computing support and
guest memory is encrypted in it. Places checking cc_platform_has()
with GUEST_MEM_ENCRYPT attr should return "True" in Isolation VM.

Hyper-V Isolation VMs need to adjust the SWIOTLB size just like SEV
guests. Add a hyperv_cc_platform_has() variant which enables that.
