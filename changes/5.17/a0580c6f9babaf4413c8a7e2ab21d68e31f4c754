filemap: Convert tracing of page cache operations to folio

Pass the folio instead of a page.  The page was already implicitly a
folio as it accessed page->mapping directly.  Add the order of the folio
to the tracepoint, as this is important information.  Also drop printing
the address of the struct page as the pfn provides better information
than the struct page address.
