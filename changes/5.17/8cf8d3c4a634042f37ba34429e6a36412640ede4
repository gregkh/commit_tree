tty: serial: samsung: Fix console registration from module

On modern Exynos SoCs (like Exynos850) the UART can be implemented as a
part of USI IP-core. In such case, USI driver is used to initialize USI
registers, and it also calls of_platform_populate() to instantiate all
sub-nodes (e.g. serial node) of USI node. When serial driver is
built-in, but USI driver is a module, and CONFIG_SERIAL_SAMSUNG_CONSOLE
is enabled, next call chain will happen when loading USI module from
user space:

    usi_init
      v
    usi_probe
      v
    of_platform_populate
      v
    s3c24xx_serial_probe
      v
    uart_add_one_port
      v
    uart_configure_port
      v
    register_console
      v
    try_enable_new_console
      v
    s3c24xx_serial_console_setup

But because the serial driver is built-in, and
s3c24xx_serial_console_setup() is marked with __init keyword, that
symbol will discarded and long gone by that time already, causing failed
paging request.

That happens during the next config combination:

    EXYNOS_USI=m
    SERIAL_SAMSUNG=y
    SERIAL_SAMSUNG_CONSOLE=y

That config should be completely possible, so rather than limiting
SERIAL_SAMSUNG choice to "m" only when USI=m, remove __init keyword for
all affected functions.
