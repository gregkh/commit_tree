cifs: fix set of group SID via NTSD xattrs

'setcifsacl -g <SID>' silently fails to set the group SID on server.

Actually, the bug existed since commit 438471b67963 ("CIFS: Add support
for setting owner info, dos attributes, and create time"), but this fix
will not apply cleanly to kernel versions <= v5.10.
