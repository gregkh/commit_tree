ice: Match on all profiles in slow-path

In switchdev mode, slow-path rules need to match all protocols, in order
to correctly redirect unfiltered or missed packets to the uplink. To set
this up for the virtual function to uplink flow, the rule that redirects
packets to the control VSI must have the tunnel type set to
ICE_SW_TUN_AND_NON_TUN. As a result of that new tunnel type being set,
ice_get_compat_fv_bitmap will select ICE_PROF_ALL. At that point all
profiles would be selected for this rule, resulting in the desired
behavior. Without this change slow-path would not work with
tunnel protocols.
