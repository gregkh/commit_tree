KVM: Move x86's perf guest info callbacks to generic KVM

Move x86's perf guest callbacks into common KVM, as they are semantically
identical to arm64's callbacks (the only other such KVM callbacks).
arm64 will convert to the common versions in a future patch.

Implement the necessary arm64 arch hooks now to avoid having to provide
stubs or a temporary #define (from x86) to avoid arm64 compilation errors
when CONFIG_GUEST_PERF_EVENTS=y.
