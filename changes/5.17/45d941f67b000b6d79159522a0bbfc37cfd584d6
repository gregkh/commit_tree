arm64: dts: imx8ulp: Set #thermal-sensor-cells to 1 as required

The SCMI binding clearly states the value of #thermal-sensor-cells must
be 1. However arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8ulp.dtsi sets it 0 which
results in the following warning with dtbs_check:

  |  arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8ulp-evk.dt.yaml: scmi:
  | 		protocol@15:#thermal-sensor-cells:0:0: 1 was expected
  |	From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/firmware/arm,scmi.yaml

Fix it by setting it to 1 as required.
