crypto: jitter - consider 32 LSB for APT

The APT compares the current time stamp with a pre-set value. The
current code only considered the 4 LSB only. Yet, after reviews by
mathematicians of the user space Jitter RNG version >= 3.1.0, it was
concluded that the APT can be calculated on the 32 LSB of the time
delta. Thi change is applied to the kernel.

This fixes a bug where an AMD EPYC fails this test as its RDTSC value
contains zeros in the LSB. The most appropriate fix would have been to
apply a GCD calculation and divide the time stamp by the GCD. Yet, this
is a significant code change that will be considered for a future
update. Note, tests showed that constantly the GCD always was 32 on
these systems, i.e. the 5 LSB were always zero (thus failing the APT
since it only considered the 4 LSB for its calculation).
