perf cs-etm: Remove duplicate and incorrect aux size checks

There are two checks, one is for size when running without admin, but
this one is covered by the driver and reported on in more detail here
(builtin-record.c):

  pr_err("Permission error mapping pages.\n"
         "Consider increasing "
         "/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb,\n"
         "or try again with a smaller value of -m/--mmap_pages.\n"
         "(current value: %u,%u)\n",

This had the effect of artificially limiting the aux buffer size to a
value smaller than what was allowed because perf_event_mlock_kb wasn't
taken into account.

The second is to check for a power of two, but this is covered here
(evlist.c):

  pr_info("rounding mmap pages size to %s (%lu pages)\n",
          buf, pages);
