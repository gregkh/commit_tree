ASoC: tegra20: i2s: Filter out unsupported rates

Support new nvidia,fixed-parent-rate device-tree property which instructs
I2S that board wants parent clock rate to stay at a fixed rate. This allows
to play audio over S/PDIF and I2S simultaneously. The root of the problem
is that audio components on Tegra share the same audio PLL, and thus, only
a subset of rates can be supported if we want to play audio simultaneously.
Filter out audio rates that don't match parent clock rate if device-tree
has the nvidia,fixed-parent-rate property.
