crypto: hisilicon/qm - fix deadlock for remove driver

When remove the driver and executing the task occur at the same time,
the following deadlock will be triggered:

Chain exists of:
    sva_lock --> uacce_mutex --> &qm->qps_lock
    Possible unsafe locking scenario:
		CPU0                    CPU1
		----                    ----
	lock(&qm->qps_lock);
					lock(uacce_mutex);
					lock(&qm->qps_lock);
	lock(sva_lock);

And the lock 'qps_lock' is used to protect qp. Therefore, it's reasonable
cycle is to continue until the qp memory is released. So move the release
lock infront of 'uacce_remove'.
