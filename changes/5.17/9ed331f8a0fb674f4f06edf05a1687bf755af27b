auxdisplay: lcd2s: Use proper API to free the instance of charlcd object

While it might work, the current approach is fragile in a few ways:
- whenever members in the structure are shuffled, the pointer will be wrong
- the resource freeing may include more than covered by kfree()

Fix this by using charlcd_free() call instead of kfree().
