Revert "of: net: support NVMEM cells with MAC in text format"

This reverts commit 9ed319e411915e882bb4ed99be3ae78667a70022.

We can already post process a nvmem cell value in a particular driver.
Instead of having yet another place to convert the values, the post
processing hook of the nvmem provider should be used in this case.
