HID: magicmouse: set Magic Trackpad 2021 name

The Apple Magic Trackpad 2021 (3rd generation) has the same product ID
as the 2nd generation. However, when connected through Bluetooth, the
version has changed from 0x107 to 0x110.

The other meaningful change is that the name has dropped the generation
number and now it is just "Apple Inc. Magic Trackpad", like the first
generation model.

Set the device name correctly to ensure the same driver settings are
loaded, whether connected via Bluetooth or USB.
