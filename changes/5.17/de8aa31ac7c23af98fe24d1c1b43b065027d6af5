Input: zinitix - add new compatible strings

This driver works just fine with the BT404 version of the touchscreen
as well. Tested on the Samsung GT-I8160 (Codina) mobile phone.

Add all the new variants from the binding document so people can
easily test them, we believe most of them work more or less.
