drm/i915: Introduce lpt_pch_disable()

Let's add lpt_pch_disable() as the counterpart to
lpt_pch_enable().

Note that unlike the ilk+ code the fdi_link_train()
and fdi_disable() calls are still left directly in
intel_crt.c. If we wanted to move those we'd need to
add lpt_pch_pre_enable(). But the two fdi direct fdi
calls are pretry symmetric so it doesn't seem too bad
to just keep them as is.

v2: Make lpt_disable_pch_transcoder() static (lkp@intel.com)
