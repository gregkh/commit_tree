libbpf: Deprecate bpf_object__load_xattr()

Deprecate non-extensible bpf_object__load_xattr() in v0.8 ([0]).

With log_level control through bpf_object_open_opts or
bpf_program__set_log_level(), we are finally at the point where
bpf_object__load_xattr() doesn't provide any functionality that can't be
accessed through other (better) ways. The other feature,
target_btf_path, is also controllable through bpf_object_open_opts.
