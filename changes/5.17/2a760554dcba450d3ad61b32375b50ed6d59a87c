net:mcf8390: Use platform_get_irq() to get the interrupt

It is not recommened to use platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_IRQ)
for requesting IRQ's resources any more, as they can be not ready yet in
case of DT-booting.

platform_get_irq() instead is a recommended way for getting IRQ even if
it was not retrieved earlier.

It also makes code simpler because we're getting "int" value right away
and no conversion from resource to int is required.
