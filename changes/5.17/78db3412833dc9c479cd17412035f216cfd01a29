mm: add anonymous vma name refcounting

While forking a process with high number (64K) of named anonymous vmas
the overhead caused by strdup() is noticeable.  Experiments with ARM64
Android device show up to 40% performance regression when forking a
process with 64k unpopulated anonymous vmas using the max name lengths
vs the same process with the same number of anonymous vmas having no
name.

Introduce anon_vma_name refcounted structure to avoid the overhead of
copying vma names during fork() and when splitting named anonymous vmas.

When a vma is duplicated, instead of copying the name we increment the
refcount of this structure.  Multiple vmas can point to the same
anon_vma_name as long as they increment the refcount.  The name member
of anon_vma_name structure is assigned at structure allocation time and
is never changed.  If vma name changes then the refcount of the original
structure is dropped, a new anon_vma_name structure is allocated to hold
the new name and the vma pointer is updated to point to the new
structure.

With this approach the fork() performance regressions is reduced 3-4x
times and with usecases using more reasonable number of VMAs (a few
thousand) the regressions is not measurable.
