tracefs: Set the group ownership in apply_options() not parse_options()

Al Viro brought it to my attention that the dentries may not be filled
when the parse_options() is called, causing the call to set_gid() to
possibly crash. It should only be called if parse_options() succeeds
totally anyway.

He suggested the logical place to do the update is in apply_options().
