media: i2c: ov8865: Fix lockdep error

ov8865_state_init() calls ov8865_state_mipi_configure() which uses
__v4l2_ctrl_s_ctrl[_int64](). This means that sensor->mutex (which
is also sensor->ctrls.handler.lock) must be locked before calling
ov8865_state_init().

Note ov8865_state_mipi_configure() is also used in other places where
the lock is already held so it cannot be changed itself.

This fixes the following lockdep kernel WARN:
