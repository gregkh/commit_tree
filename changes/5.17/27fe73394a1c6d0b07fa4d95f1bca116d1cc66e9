mm, kasan: use compare-exchange operation to set KASAN page tag

It has been reported that the tag setting operation on newly-allocated
pages can cause the page flags to be corrupted when performed
concurrently with other flag updates as a result of the use of
non-atomic operations.

Fix the problem by using a compare-exchange loop to update the tag.
