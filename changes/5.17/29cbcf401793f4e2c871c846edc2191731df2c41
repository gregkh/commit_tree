btrfs: stop accessing ->extent_root directly

When we start having multiple extent roots we'll need to use a helper to
get to the correct extent_root.  Rename fs_info->extent_root to
_extent_root and convert all of the users of the extent root to using
the btrfs_extent_root() helper.  This will allow us to easily clean up
the remaining direct accesses in the future.
