KVM: arm64: pkvm: Disable GICv2 support

GICv2 requires having device mappings in guests and the hypervisor,
which is incompatible with the current pKVM EL2 page ownership model
which only covers memory. While it would be desirable to support pKVM
with GICv2, this will require a lot more work, so let's make the
current assumption clear until then.
