ceph: Fix incorrect statfs report for small quota

Problem:
The statfs reports incorrect free/available space for quota less then
CEPH_BLOCK size (4M).

Solution:
For quota less than CEPH_BLOCK size, smaller block size of 4K is used.
But if quota is less than 4K, it is decided to go with binary use/free
of 4K block. For quota size less than 4K size, report the
total=used=4K,free=0 when quota is full and total=free=4K,used=0
otherwise.
