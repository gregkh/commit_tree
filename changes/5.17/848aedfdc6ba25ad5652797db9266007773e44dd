ASoC: soc-pcm: test refcount before triggering

On start/pause_release/resume, when more than one FE is connected to
the same BE, it's possible that the trigger is sent more than
once. This is not desirable, we only want to trigger a BE once, which
is straightforward to implement with a refcount.

For stop/pause/suspend, the problem is more complicated: the check
implemented in snd_soc_dpcm_can_be_free_stop() may fail due to a
conceptual deadlock when we trigger the BE before the FE. In this
case, the FE states have not yet changed, so there are corner cases
where the TRIGGER_STOP is never sent - the dual case of start where
multiple triggers might be sent.

This patch suggests an unconditional trigger in all cases, without
checking the FE states, using a refcount protected by the BE PCM
stream lock.
