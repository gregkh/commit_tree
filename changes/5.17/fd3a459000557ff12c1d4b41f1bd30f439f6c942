net: bridge: Get SIOCGIFBR/SIOCSIFBR ioctl working in compat mode

In compat mode SIOC{G,S}IFBR ioctls were only supporting
BRCTL_GET_VERSION returning an artificially version to spur userland
tool to use SIOCDEVPRIVATE instead. But some userland tools ignore that
and use SIOC{G,S}IFBR unconditionally as seen with busybox's brctl.

Example of non working 32-bit brctl with CONFIG_COMPAT=y:
$ brctl show
brctl: SIOCGIFBR: Invalid argument

Example of fixed 32-bit brctl with CONFIG_COMPAT=y:
$ brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
br0
