net/mlx5: Introduce control IRQ request API

Currently, IRQ layer have a separate flow for ctrl and comp IRQs, and
the distinction between ctrl and comp IRQs is done in the IRQ layer.

In order to ease the coding and maintenance of the IRQ layer,
introduce a new API for requesting control IRQs -
mlx5_ctrl_irq_request(struct mlx5_core_dev *dev).
