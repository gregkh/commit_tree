pcmcia: fix setting of kthread task states

We need to set TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before calling kthread_should_stop().
Otherwise, kthread_stop() might see that the pccardd thread is still
in TASK_RUNNING state and fail to wake it up.

Additionally, we only need to set the state back to TASK_RUNNING if
kthread_should_stop() breaks the loop.
