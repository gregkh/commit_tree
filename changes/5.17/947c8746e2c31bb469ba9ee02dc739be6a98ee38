net: dsa: assign a bridge number even without TX forwarding offload

The service where DSA assigns a unique bridge number for each forwarding
domain is useful even for drivers which do not implement the TX
forwarding offload feature.

For example, drivers might use the dp->bridge_num for FDB isolation.

So rename ds->num_fwd_offloading_bridges to ds->max_num_bridges, and
calculate a unique bridge_num for all drivers that set this value.
