powerpc: Mark probe_machine() __init and static

Prior to commit b1923caa6e64 ("powerpc: Merge 32-bit and 64-bit
setup_arch()") probe_machine() was called from setup_32/64.c and lived
in setup-common.c. But now it's only called from setup-common.c so it
can be static and __init, and we don't need the declaration in
machdep.h either.
