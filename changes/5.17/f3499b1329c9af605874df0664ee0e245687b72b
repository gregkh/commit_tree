ARM: dts: am335x-boneblack-common: move system-power-controller

Move the rtc node system-power-controller property from
am335x-boneblack-common.dtsi to am335x-bone-common.dtsi.

am335x-boneblack-common.dtsi is included by am335x-boneblack.dts,
am335x-boneblack-wireless.dts, am335x-sancloud-bbe.dts and
am335x-sancloud-bbe-lite.dts. All of these dts files also include
am335x-bone-common.dtsi and thus will retain the rtc node
system-power-controller property.

am335x-bone-common.dtsi is also included by am335x-bone.dts [1],
am335x-bonegreen.dts [2] and am335x-bonegreen-wireless.dts [3]. These
boards will now have the rtc node system-power-controller property too.
This is valid as they also have PMIC_POWR_EN (ZCZ C6) connected to
PWR_EN on the TPS65217B PMIC.

Based on commit 15c7be47fb7c ("ARM: dts: am335x: Add rtc node as
system-power-controller") by Keerthy in ti-linux-5.4.y branch [4].
