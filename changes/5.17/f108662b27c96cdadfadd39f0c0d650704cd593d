selftests/bpf: Add tests for bpf_find_vma

Add tests for bpf_find_vma in perf_event program and kprobe program. The
perf_event program is triggered from NMI context, so the second call of
bpf_find_vma() will return -EBUSY (irq_work busy). The kprobe program,
on the other hand, does not have this constraint.

Also add tests for illegal writes to task or vma from the callback
function. The verifier should reject both cases.
