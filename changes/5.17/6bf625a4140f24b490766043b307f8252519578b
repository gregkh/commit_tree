Drivers: hv: vmbus: Rework use of DMA_BIT_MASK(64)

Using DMA_BIT_MASK(64) as an initializer for a global variable
causes problems with Clang 12.0.1. The compiler doesn't understand
that value 64 is excluded from the shift at compile time, resulting
in a build error.

While this is a compiler problem, avoid the issue by setting up
the dma_mask memory as part of struct hv_device, and initialize
it using dma_set_mask().
