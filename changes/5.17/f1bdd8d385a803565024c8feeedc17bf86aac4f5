ASoC: amd: Add module to determine ACP configuration

ACP hw block configuration differs across various distributions
and hence it's required to register different drivers module for
distributions. For now we support three ACP drivers:

* ACP without SOF use case
* ACP with SOF use case
* ACP with SOF use case for DMIC and non SOF for I2S endpoints

As all above driver registers with common PCI ID for ACP hw block
we need code to determine ACP configuration and auto select driver
module. This patch expose function that return configuration flag
based on dmi checks for a system. ACP driver module probe register
platform device based on such configuration flag to avoid conflict
with other ACP drivers probed for same PCI ID.
