block: Fix wrong offset in bio_truncate()

bio_truncate() clears the buffer outside of last block of bdev, however
current bio_truncate() is using the wrong offset of page. So it can
return the uninitialized data.

This happened when both of truncated/corrupted FS and userspace (via
bdev) are trying to read the last of bdev.
