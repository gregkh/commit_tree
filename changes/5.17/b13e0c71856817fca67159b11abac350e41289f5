block: bio-integrity: Advance seed correctly for larger interval sizes

Commit 309a62fa3a9e ("bio-integrity: bio_integrity_advance must update
integrity seed") added code to update the integrity seed value when
advancing a bio. However, it failed to take into account that the
integrity interval might be larger than the 512-byte block layer
sector size. This broke bio splitting on PI devices with 4KB logical
blocks.

The seed value should be advanced by bio_integrity_intervals() and not
the number of sectors.
