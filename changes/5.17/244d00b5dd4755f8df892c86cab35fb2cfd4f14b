x86/speculation: Use generic retpoline by default on AMD

AMD retpoline may be susceptible to speculation. The speculation
execution window for an incorrect indirect branch prediction using
LFENCE/JMP sequence may potentially be large enough to allow
exploitation using Spectre V2.

By default, don't use retpoline,lfence on AMD.  Instead, use the
generic retpoline.
