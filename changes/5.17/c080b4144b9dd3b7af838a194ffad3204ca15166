btrfs: defrag: properly update range->start for autodefrag

[BUG]
After commit 7b508037d4ca ("btrfs: defrag: use defrag_one_cluster() to
implement btrfs_defrag_file()") autodefrag no longer properly re-defrag
the file from previously finished location.

[CAUSE]
The recent refactoring of defrag only focuses on defrag ioctl subpage
support, doesn't take autodefrag into consideration.

There are two problems involved which prevents autodefrag to restart its
scan:

- No range.start update
  Previously when one defrag target is found, range->start will be
  updated to indicate where next search should start from.

  But now btrfs_defrag_file() doesn't update it anymore, making all
  autodefrag to rescan from file offset 0.

  This would also make autodefrag to mark the same range dirty again and
  again, causing extra IO.

- No proper quick exit for defrag_one_cluster()
  Currently if we reached or exceed @max_sectors limit, we just exit
  defrag_one_cluster(), and let next defrag_one_cluster() call to do a
  quick exit.
  This makes @cur increase, thus no way to properly know which range is
  defragged and which range is skipped.

[FIX]
The fix involves two modifications:

- Update range->start to next cluster start
  This is a little different from the old behavior.
  Previously range->start is updated to the next defrag target.

  But in the end, the behavior should still be pretty much the same,
  as now we skip to next defrag target inside btrfs_defrag_file().

  Thus if auto-defrag determines to re-scan, then we still do the skip,
  just at a different timing.

- Make defrag_one_cluster() to return >0 to indicate a quick exit
  So that btrfs_defrag_file() can also do a quick exit, without
  increasing @cur to the range end, and re-use @cur to update
  @range->start.

- Add comment for btrfs_defrag_file() to mention the range->start update
  Currently only autodefrag utilize this behavior, as defrag ioctl won't
  set @max_to_defrag parameter, thus unless interrupted it will always
  try to defrag the whole range.
