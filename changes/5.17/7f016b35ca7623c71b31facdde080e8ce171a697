HID: amd_sfh: Add interrupt handler to process interrupts

On newer AMD platforms with SFH, it is observed that random interrupts
get generated on the SFH hardware and until this is cleared the firmware
sensor processing is stalled, resulting in no data been received to
driver side.

Add routines to handle these interrupts, so that firmware operations are
not stalled.
