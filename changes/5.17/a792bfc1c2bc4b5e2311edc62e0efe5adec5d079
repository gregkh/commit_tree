ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-stream: limit PROCEN workaround

The work-around enabled in hda-stream.c is only required on earlier
versions of SOCs/PCH (Skylake, KabyLake, ApolloLake,
GeminiLake). Before setting the format on the host DMA, it is required
to couple the host and link DMA - which as a consequence shall use the
same format.

This patch introduces a quirk field in the platform descriptor and
makes the work-around conditional. Newer platforms have
no limitations on the use of host and link DMA, which can use
different formats.
