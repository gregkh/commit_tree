tty: n_gsm: fix proper link termination after failed open

Trying to open a DLCI by sending a SABM frame may fail with a timeout.
The link is closed on the initiator side without informing the responder
about this event. The responder assumes the link is open after sending a
UA frame to answer the SABM frame. The link gets stuck in a half open
state.

This patch fixes this by initiating the proper link termination procedure
after link setup timeout instead of silently closing it down.
