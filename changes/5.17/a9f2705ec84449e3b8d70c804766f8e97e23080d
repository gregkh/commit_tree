KVM: VMX: Save HOST_CR3 in vmx_set_host_fs_gs()

The host CR3 in the vcpu thread can only be changed when scheduling,
so commit 15ad9762d69f ("KVM: VMX: Save HOST_CR3 in vmx_prepare_switch_to_guest()")
changed vmx.c to only save it in vmx_prepare_switch_to_guest().

However, it also has to be synced in vmx_sync_vmcs_host_state() when switching VMCS.
vmx_set_host_fs_gs() is called in both places, so rename it to
vmx_set_vmcs_host_state() and make it update HOST_CR3.
