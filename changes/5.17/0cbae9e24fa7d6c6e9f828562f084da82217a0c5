ucounts: Handle wrapping in is_ucounts_overlimit

While examining is_ucounts_overlimit and reading the various messages
I realized that is_ucounts_overlimit fails to deal with counts that
may have wrapped.

Being wrapped should be a transitory state for counts and they should
never be wrapped for long, but it can happen so handle it.
