locking: Allow to include asm/spinlock_types.h from linux/spinlock_types_raw.h

The printk header file includes ratelimit_types.h for its __ratelimit()
based usage. It is required for the static initializer used in
printk_ratelimited(). It uses a raw_spinlock_t and includes the
spinlock_types.h.

PREEMPT_RT substitutes spinlock_t with a rtmutex based implementation and so
its spinlock_t implmentation (provided by spinlock_rt.h) includes rtmutex.h and
atomic.h which leads to recursive includes where defines are missing.

By including only the raw_spinlock_t defines it avoids the atomic.h
related includes at this stage.

The WARN / BUG include pulls in printk.h and then ptrace.h expects WARN
(from bug.h) which is not yet complete. Even hw_irq.h has WARN_ON()
statements.

On POWERPC64 there are missing atomic64 defines while building 32bit

The generic fallback is not included, atomics itself are not used. If
kernel.h does not include printk.h then it comes later from the bug.h
include.

Allow asm/spinlock_types.h to be included from
linux/spinlock_types_raw.h.
