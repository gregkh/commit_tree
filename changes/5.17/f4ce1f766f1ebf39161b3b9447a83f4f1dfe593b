cxl/acpi: Convert CFMWS parsing to ACPI sub-table helpers

The cxl_acpi driver originally open-coded its table parsing since the
ACPI subtable helpers were marked __init and only used in early NUMA
initialization.  Now that those helpers have been exported for driver
usage replace the open-coded solution with the common one.
