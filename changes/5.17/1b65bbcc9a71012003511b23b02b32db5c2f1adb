net: ipa: skip SKB copy if no netdev

In ipa_endpoint_skb_copy(), a new socket buffer structure is
allocated so that some data can be copied into it.  However, after
doing this, if the endpoint has a null netdev pointer, we just drop
free the socket buffer.

Instead, check endpoint->netdev pointer first, and just return early
if it's null.  Also return early if the SKB allocation fails, to
avoid the deeper indentation in the normal path.
