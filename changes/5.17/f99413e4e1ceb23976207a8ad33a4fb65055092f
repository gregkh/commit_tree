drm/ingenic: Remove bogus register write

Commit 1bdb542da736 ("drm/ingenic: Simplify code by using hwdescs
array") caused the dma_hwdesc_phys_f{0,1} variables to be used while
uninitialized in a mmio register write, which most certainly broke the
ingenic-drm driver.

However, the very same patchset also submitted commit 6055466203df
("drm/ingenic: Upload palette before frame"), which restored a correct
behaviour by doing the register writes in a different place in the code.

What's left of this, is just to remove the bogus register writes in the
probe function.
