fs: dlm: add lkb debugfs functionality

This patch adds functionality to add an lkb during runtime. This is a
highly debugging feature only, wrong input can crash the kernel. It is a
early state feature as well. The goal is to provide a user interface for
manipulate dlm state and combine it with the rawmsg feature. It is
debugfs functionality, we don't care about UAPI breakage. Even it's
possible to add lkb's/rsb's which could never be exists in such wat by
using normal DLM operation. The user of this interface always need to
think before using this feature, not every crash which happens can really
occur during normal dlm operation.

Future there should be more functionality to add a more realistic lkb
which reflects normal DLM state inside the kernel. For now this is
enough.
