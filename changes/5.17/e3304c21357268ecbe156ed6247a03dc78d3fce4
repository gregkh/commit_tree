perf sort: Include global and local variants for p_stage_cyc sort key

Sort key 'p_stage_cyc' is used to present the latency cycles spent in
pipeline stages.

perf has local 'p_stage_cyc' sort key to display this info. There is no
global variant available for this sort key. The local variant shows
latency in a single sample, whereas the global value will be useful to
present the total latency (sum of latencies) in the hist entry. It
represents the latency number multiplied by the number of samples.

Add global ('p_stage_cyc') and local variant ('local_p_stage_cyc') for
this sort key. Use 'local_p_stage_cyc' as default option for "mem" sort
mode.

Also add this to the list of dynamic sort keys and made the
"dynamic_headers" and "arch_specific_sort_keys" as static.
