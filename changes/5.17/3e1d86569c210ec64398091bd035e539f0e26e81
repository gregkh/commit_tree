RISC-V: KVM: Add SBI HSM extension in KVM

SBI HSM extension allows OS to start/stop harts any time. It also allows
ordered booting of harts instead of random booting.

Implement SBI HSM exntesion and designate the vcpu 0 as the boot vcpu id.
All other non-zero non-booting vcpus should be brought up by the OS
implementing HSM extension. If the guest OS doesn't implement HSM
extension, only single vcpu will be available to OS.
