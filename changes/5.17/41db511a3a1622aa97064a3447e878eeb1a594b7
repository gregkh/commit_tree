bpf, docs: Split the comparism to classic BPF from instruction-set.rst

Split the introductory that explain eBPF vs classic BPF and how it maps
to hardware from the instruction set specification into a standalone
document.  This duplicates a little bit of information but gives us a
useful reference for the eBPF instrution set that is not encumbered by
classic BPF.
