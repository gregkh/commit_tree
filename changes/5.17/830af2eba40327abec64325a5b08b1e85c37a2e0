netfilter: conntrack: don't increment invalid counter on NF_REPEAT

The packet isn't invalid, REPEAT means we're trying again after cleaning
out a stale connection, e.g. via tcp tracker.

This caused increases of invalid stat counter in a test case involving
frequent connection reuse, even though no packet is actually invalid.
