net/fsl: xgmac_mdio: Add workaround for erratum A-009885

Once an MDIO read transaction is initiated, we must read back the data
register within 16 MDC cycles after the transaction completes. Outside
of this window, reads may return corrupt data.

Therefore, disable local interrupts in the critical section, to
maximize the probability that we can satisfy this requirement.
