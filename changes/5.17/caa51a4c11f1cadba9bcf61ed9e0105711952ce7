drm/vc4: hdmi: Rework the pre_crtc_configure error handling

Since our pre_crtc_configure hook returned void, we didn't implement a
goto-based error path handling, leading to errors like failing to put
back the device in pm_runtime in all the error paths, but also failing
to disable the pixel clock if clk_set_min_rate on the HSM clock fails.

Move to a goto-based implementation to have an easier consitency.
