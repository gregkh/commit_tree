counter: 104-quad-8: Fix use-after-free by quad8_irq_handler

On unbind an irq might be pending which results in quad8_irq_handler()
calling counter_push_event() for a counter that is already unregistered.
This patch fixes that situation by passing the struct counter_device dev
to devm_request_irq() rather than the parent's so that the irq handler
is cleaned before the counter is unregistered.
