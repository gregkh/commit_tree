KVM: x86: Invoke kvm_vcpu_block() directly for non-HALTED wait states

Call kvm_vcpu_block() directly for all wait states except HALTED so that
kvm_vcpu_halt() is no longer a misnomer on x86.

Functionally, this means KVM will never attempt halt-polling or adjust
vcpu->halt_poll_ns for INIT_RECEIVED (a.k.a. Wait-For-SIPI (WFS)) or
AP_RESET_HOLD; UNINITIALIZED is handled in kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run(),
and x86 doesn't use any other "wait" states.

As mentioned above, the motivation of this is purely so that "halt" isn't
overloaded on x86, e.g. in KVM's stats.  Skipping halt-polling for WFS
(and RESET_HOLD) has no meaningful effect on guest performance as there
are typically single-digit numbers of INIT-SIPI sequences per AP vCPU,
per boot, versus thousands of HLTs just to boot to console.
