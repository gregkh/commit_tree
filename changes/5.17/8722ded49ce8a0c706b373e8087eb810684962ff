drm/i915: Fix error pointer dereference in i915_gem_do_execbuffer()

Originally "out_fence" was set using out_fence = sync_file_create() but
which returns NULL, but now it is set with out_fence = eb_requests_create()
which returns error pointers.  The error path needs to be modified to
avoid an Oops in the "goto err_request;" path.
