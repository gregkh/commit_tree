drm/bridge: parade-ps8640: Add backpointer to drm_device in drm_dp_aux

When we added the support for the AUX channel in commit 13afcdd7277e
("drm/bridge: parade-ps8640: Add support for AUX channel") we forgot
to set "drm_dev" to avoid the warning splat at the beginning of
drm_dp_aux_register(). Since everything was working I guess I never
noticed the splat when testing against mainline. In any case, it's
easy to fix. This is basically just like commit 6cba3fe43341 ("drm/dp:
Add backpointer to drm_device in drm_dp_aux") but just for the
parade-ps8640.
