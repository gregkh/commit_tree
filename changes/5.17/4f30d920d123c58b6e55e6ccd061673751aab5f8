drm/amdgpu: move kfd post_reset out of reset_sriov function

Fixes: 9f4f2c1a3524 ("drm/amd/amdgpu: fix the kfd pre_reset sequence in sriov")

For sriov XGMI  configuration, the host driver will handle the hive reset,
so in guest side, the reset_sriov only be called once on one device. This will
make kfd post_reset unblanced with kfd pre_reset since kfd pre_reset already
been moved out of reset_sriov function. Move kfd post_reset out of reset_sriov
function to make them balance .
