kbuild: do not include include/config/auto.conf from shell scripts

Richard Weinberger pointed out the risk of sourcing the kernel config
from shell scripts [1], and proposed some patches [2], [3]. It is a good
point, but it took a long time because I was wondering how to fix this.

This commit goes with simple grep approach because there are only a few
scripts including the kernel configuration.

scripts/link_vmlinux.sh has references to a bunch of CONFIG options,
all of which are boolean. I added is_enabled() helper as
scripts/package/{mkdebian,builddeb} do.

scripts/gen_autoksyms.sh uses 'eval', stating "to expand the whitelist
path". I removed it since it is the issue we are trying to fix.

I was a bit worried about the cost of invoking the grep command over
again. I extracted the grep parts from it, and measured the cost. It
was approximately 0.03 sec, which I hope is acceptable.

[test code]

  $ cat test-grep.sh
  #!/bin/sh

  is_enabled() {
          grep -q "^$1=y" include/config/auto.conf
  }
