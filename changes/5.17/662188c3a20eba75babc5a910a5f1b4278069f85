mm/slub: Simplify struct slab slabs field definition

Before commit b47291ef02b0 ("mm, slub: change percpu partial accounting
from objects to pages") we had to fit two integer fields into a native
word size, so we used short int on 32-bit and int on 64-bit via #ifdef.
After that commit there is only one integer field, so we can simply
define it as int everywhere.
