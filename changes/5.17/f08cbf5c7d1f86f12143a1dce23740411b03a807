KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Avoid changing MSR[RI] in entry and exit

kvm_hstate.in_guest provides the equivalent of MSR[RI]=0 protection,
and it covers the existing MSR[RI]=0 section in late entry and early
exit, so clearing and setting MSR[RI] in those cases does not
actually do anything useful.

Remove the RI manipulation and replace it with comments. Make the
in_guest memory accesses a bit closer to a proper critical section
pattern. This speeds up guest entry/exit performance.

This also removes the MSR[RI] warnings which aren't very interesting
and would cause crashes if they hit due to causing an interrupt in
non-recoverable code.
