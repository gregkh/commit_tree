gpio: Revert regression in sysfs-gpio (gpiolib.c)

Some GPIO lines have stopped working after the patch
commit 2ab73c6d8323f ("gpio: Support GPIO controllers without pin-ranges")

And this has supposedly been fixed in the following patches
commit 89ad556b7f96a ("gpio: Avoid using pin ranges with !PINCTRL")
commit 6dbbf84603961 ("gpiolib: Don't free if pin ranges are not defined")

But an erratic behavior where some GPIO lines work while others do not work
has been introduced.

This patch reverts those changes so that the sysfs-gpio interface works
properly again.
