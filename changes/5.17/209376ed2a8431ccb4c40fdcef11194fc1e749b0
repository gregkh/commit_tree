selftests/vm: make charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh work with existing cgroup setting

The hugetlb cgroup reservation test charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh assume
that no cgroup filesystems are mounted before running the test.  That is
not true in many cases.  As a result, the test fails to run.  Fix that
by querying the current cgroup mount setting and using the existing
cgroup setup instead before attempting to freshly mount a cgroup
filesystem.

Similar change is also made for hugetlb_reparenting_test.sh as well,
though it still has problem if cgroup v2 isn't used.

The patched test scripts were run on a centos 8 based system to verify
that they ran properly.
