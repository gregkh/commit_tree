KVM: VMX: Add and use X86_CR4_TLBFLUSH_BITS when !enable_ept

In set_cr4_guest_host_mask(), X86_CR4_PGE is set to be intercepted when
!enable_ept just because X86_CR4_PGE is the only bit that is
responsible for flushing TLB but listed in KVM_POSSIBLE_CR4_GUEST_BITS.

It is clearer and self-documented to use X86_CR4_TLBFLUSH_BITS instead.

No functionality changed.
