habanalabs: fix race condition in multi CS completion

Race example scenario:
1. User have 2 threads that waits on multi CS:
   - thread_0 waits on QID 0 and uses multi CS context 0.
   - thread_1 waits on QID 1 and uses multi CS context 1.
2. thread_1 got completion and release multi CS context 1.
3. CS related to multi CS of thread_0 starts executing
   complete_multi_cs function, the first iteration of the loop
   completes the multi CS of thread_0, hence multi CS context 0
   is released.
4. thread_1 waits on QID 1 and uses multi CS context 0.
5. thread_0 waits on QID 0 and uses multi CS context 1.
6. The second iterattion of the loop (from step 3) starts, which
   means, start checking multi CS context 1:
   - multi CS contetxt is being used by thread_0 waiting on QID 0.
   - The fence of the CS (still CS from step 3) has QID map the same
     as the multi CS context 1.
   - multi CS context 1 (thread_0) gets completion on CS that triggered
     already thread_0 (with multi CS context 0) and is no longer
     being waited on.

Fixed by exiting the loop in complete_multi_cs after getting completion
