x86/fpu: Correct AVX512 state tracking

Add a separate, local mask for tracking AVX512 usage which does not
include the opmask xfeature set. Opmask registers usage does not cause
frequency throttling so it is a completely unnecessary false positive.

While at it, carve it out into a separate function to keep that
abomination extracted out.
