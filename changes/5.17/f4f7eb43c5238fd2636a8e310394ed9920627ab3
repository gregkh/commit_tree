PCI: Set error response data when config read fails

When a PCI config read fails, most PCI host bridges fabricate ~0 data to
complete the CPU read.  But some host bridges do not; their drivers may
only return an error from the pci_ops.read() method.

In PCI_OP_READ() and PCI_USER_READ_CONFIG(), use PCI_SET_ERROR_RESPONSE()
to set the data value to indicate an error when pci_ops.read() fails.

This means the host bridge driver no longer needs to fabricate error data
when they detect errors.

This makes error response fabrication consistent and helps in removal of a
lot of repeated code.
