libbpf: Normalize PT_REGS_xxx() macro definitions

Refactor PT_REGS macros definitions in  bpf_tracing.h to avoid excessive
duplication. We currently have classic PT_REGS_xxx() and CO-RE-enabled
PT_REGS_xxx_CORE(). We are about to add also _SYSCALL variants, which
would require excessive copying of all the per-architecture definitions.

Instead, separate architecture-specific field/register names from the
final macro that utilize them. That way for upcoming _SYSCALL variants
we'll be able to just define x86_64 exception and otherwise have one
common set of _SYSCALL macro definitions common for all architectures.
