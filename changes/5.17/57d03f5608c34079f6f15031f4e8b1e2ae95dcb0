iavf: Fix adopting new combined setting

In some cases overloaded flag IAVF_FLAG_REINIT_ITR_NEEDED
which should indicate that interrupts need to be completely
reinitialized during reset leads to RTNL deadlocks using ethtool -C
while a reset is in progress.
To fix, it was added a new flag IAVF_FLAG_REINIT_MSIX_NEEDED
used to trigger MSI-X reinit.
New combined setting is fixed adopt after VF reset.
This has been implemented by call reinit interrupt scheme
during VF reset.
Without this fix new combined setting has never been adopted.
