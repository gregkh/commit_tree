ice: use 'int err' instead of 'int status' in ice_ptp_hw.c

The ice_ptp_hw.c file introduced a bunch of uses of "int status" instead
of the more traditional "int err" or "int ret". These are actually
traditional Linux error codes (as opposed to the recently removed
ice_status enumeration values).

We're about to add a bunch of new functions to ice_ptp_hw.c. It's
normally preferred in the ice driver to use "int ret" or "int err" when
dealing with error code values.

Instead of making the new functions use "int status" lets just fix all
of ice_ptp_hw.c to use "int err". This will match the new functions and
ensures a consistent style across at least the PTP related files.
