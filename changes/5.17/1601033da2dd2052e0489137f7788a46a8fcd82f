ASoC: ops: Check for negative values before reading them

The controls allow inputs to be specified as negative but our manipulating
them into register fields need to be done on unsigned variables so the
checks for negative numbers weren't taking effect properly. Do the checks
for negative values on the variable in the ABI struct rather than on our
local unsigned copy.
