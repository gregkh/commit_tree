scsi: message: fusion: mptsas: Use dma_alloc_coherent()

In [1], Christoph Hellwig has proposed to remove the wrappers in
include/linux/pci-dma-compat.h.

Some reasons why this API should be removed have been given by Julia
Lawall in [2].

In all these places where some memory is allocated GFP_KERNEL can be used
because they already call mpt_config() which has an explicit might_sleep().
