dt-bindings: input/ts/zinitix: Convert to YAML, fix and extend

This converts the Zinitix BT4xx and BT5xx touchscreen bindings to YAML,
fix them up a bit and extends them.

We list all the existing BT4xx and BT5xx components with compatible
strings.  These are all similar, use the same bindings and work in
similar ways.

We rename the supplies from the erroneous vdd/vddo to the actual supply
names vcca/vdd as specified on the actual component. It is long
established that supplies shall be named after the supply pin names of a
component.  The confusion probably stems from that in a certain product
the rails to the component were named vdd/vddo. Drop some notes on how OS
implementations should avoid confusion by first looking for vddo, and if
that exists assume the legacy binding pair and otherwise use vcca/vdd.

Add reset-gpios as sometimes manufacturers pulls a GPIO line to the reset
line on the chip.

Add optional touchscreen-fuzz-x and touchscreen-fuzz-y properties.
