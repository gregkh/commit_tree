fs: dlm: remove wq_alloc mutex

This patch cleanups the code for allocating a new buffer in the dlm
writequeue mechanism. There was a possible tuneup to allow scheduling
while a new writequeue entry needs to be allocated because either no
sending page is available or are full. To avoid multiple concurrent
users checking at the same time if an entry is available or full
alloc_wq was introduce that those are waiting if there is currently a
new writequeue entry in process to be queued so possible further users
will check on the new allocated writequeue entry if it's full.

To simplify the code we just remove this mutex and switch that the
already introduced spin lock will be held during writequeue check,
allocation and queueing. So other users can never check on available
writequeues while there is a new one in process but not queued yet.
