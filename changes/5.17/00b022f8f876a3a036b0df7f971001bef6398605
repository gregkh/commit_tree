net: bcmgenet: Don't claim WOL when its not available

Some of the bcmgenet platforms don't correctly support WOL, yet
ethtool returns:

"Supports Wake-on: gsf"

which is false.

Ideally if there isn't a wol_irq, or there is something else that
keeps the device from being able to wakeup it should display:

"Supports Wake-on: d"

This patch checks whether the device can wakup, before using the
hard-coded supported flags. This corrects the ethtool reporting, as
well as the WOL configuration because ethtool verifies that the mode
is supported before attempting it.
