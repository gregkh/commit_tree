rcu/nocb: Optimize kthreads and rdp initialization

Currently cpumask_available() is used to prevent from unwanted NOCB
initialization.  However if neither "rcu_nocbs=" nor "nohz_full="
parameters are passed to a kernel built with CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=n,
the initialization path is still taken, running through all sorts of
needless operations and iterations on an empty cpumask.

Fix this by relying on a real initialization state instead.  This also
optimizes kthread creation, preventing needless iteration over all online
CPUs when the kernel is booted without any offloaded CPUs.
