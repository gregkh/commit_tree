blk-mq: cleanup request allocation

Refactor the request alloction so that blk_mq_get_cached_request tries
to find a cached request first, and the entirely separate and now
self contained blk_mq_get_new_requests allocates one or more requests
if that is not possible.

There is a small change in behavior as submit_bio_checks is called
twice now if a cached request is present but can't be used, but that
is a small price to pay for unwinding this code.
