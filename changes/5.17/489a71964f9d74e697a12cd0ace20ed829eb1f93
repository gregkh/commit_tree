clk: Emit a stern warning with writable debugfs enabled

We don't want vendors to be enabling this part of the clk code and
shipping it to customers. Exposing the ability to change clk frequencies
and parents via debugfs is potentially damaging to the system if folks
don't know what they're doing. Emit a strong warning so that the message
is clear: don't enable this outside of development systems.
