scsi: lpfc: Reduce log messages seen after firmware download

Messages around firmware download were incorrectly tagged as being related
to discovery trace events. Thus, firmware download status ended up dumping
the trace log as well as the firmware update message. As there were a
couple of log messages in this state, the trace log was dumped multiple
times.

Resolve this by converting from trace events to SLI events.
