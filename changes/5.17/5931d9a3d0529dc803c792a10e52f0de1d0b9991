bpf, docs: Fix ordering of bpf documentation

This commit fixes the display of the BPF documentation in the sidebar
when rendered as HTML.

Before this patch, the sidebar would render as follows for some
sections:

| BPF Documentation
  |- BPF Type Format (BTF)
    |- BPF Type Format (BTF)

This was due to creating a heading in index.rst followed by
a sphinx toctree, where the file referenced carries the same
title as the section heading.

To fix this I applied a pattern that has been established in other
subfolders of Documentation:

1. Re-wrote index.rst to have a single toctree
2. Split the sections out in to their own files

Additionally maps.rst and programs.rst make use of a glob pattern to
include map_* or prog_* rst files in their toctree, meaning future map
or program type documentation will be automatically included.
