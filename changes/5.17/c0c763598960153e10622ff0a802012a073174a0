iommu/virtio: Pass end address to viommu_add_mapping()

To support identity mappings, the virtio-iommu driver must be able to
represent full 64-bit ranges internally. Pass (start, end) instead of
(start, size) to viommu_add/del_mapping().

Clean comments. The one about the returned size was never true: when
sweeping the whole address space the returned size will most certainly
be smaller than 2^64.
