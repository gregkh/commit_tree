dt-bindings: interrupt-controller: sifive,plic: Fix number of interrupts

The number of interrupts lacks an upper bound, thus assuming one,
causing properly grouped "interrupts-extended" properties to be flagged
as an error by "make dtbs_check".

Fix this by adding the missing "maxItems", using the architectural
maximum of 15872 interrupts.
