block: fix double bio queue when merging in cached request path

When we attempt to merge off the cached request path, we return NULL
if successful. This makes the caller believe that it's should allocate
a new request, and hence we end up with the bio both merged and associated
with a new request. This, predictably, leads to all sorts of crashes.

Pass in a pointer to the bio pointer, and clear it for the merge case.
Then the caller knows that the bio is already queued, and no new requests
need to get allocated.
