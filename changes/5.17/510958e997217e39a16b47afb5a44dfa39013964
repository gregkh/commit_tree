KVM: Force PPC to define its own rcuwait object

Do not define/reference kvm_vcpu.wait if __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_WQP is true, and
instead force the architecture (PPC) to define its own rcuwait object.
Allowing common KVM to directly access vcpu->wait without a guard makes
it all too easy to introduce potential bugs, e.g. kvm_vcpu_block(),
kvm_vcpu_on_spin(), and async_pf_execute() all operate on vcpu->wait, not
the result of kvm_arch_vcpu_get_wait(), and so may do the wrong thing for
PPC.

Due to PPC's shenanigans with respect to callbacks and waits (it switches
to the virtual core's wait object at KVM_RUN!?!?), it's not clear whether
or not this fixes any bugs.
