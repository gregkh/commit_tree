net: ethernet: ti: davinci_emac: Use platform_get_irq() to get the interrupt

platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_IRQ, ..) relies on static
allocation of IRQ resources in DT core code, this causes an issue
when using hierarchical interrupt domains using "interrupts" property
in the node as this bypasses the hierarchical setup and messes up the
irq chaining.

In preparation for removal of static setup of IRQ resource from DT core
code use platform_get_irq() for DT users only.

While at it propagate error code in case request_irq() fails instead of
returning -EBUSY.
