drm/amd/display: Revert W/A for hard hangs on DCN20/DCN21

The WA from commit 2a50edbf10c8 ("drm/amd/display: Apply w/a for hard hang
on HPD") and commit 1bd3bc745e7f ("drm/amd/display: Extend w/a for hard
hang on HPD to dcn20") causes a regression in s0ix where the system will
fail to resume properly on many laptops.  Pull the workarounds out to
avoid that s0ix regression in the common case.  This HPD hang happens with
an external device in special circumstances and a new W/A will need to be
developed for this in the future.
