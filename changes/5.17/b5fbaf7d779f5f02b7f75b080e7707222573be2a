arm64: dts: rockchip: Switch RK3399-Gru DP to SPDIF output

Commit b18c6c3c7768 ("ASoC: rockchip: cdn-dp sound output use spdif")
switched the platform to SPDIF, but we didn't fix up the device tree.

Drop the pinctrl settings, because the 'spdif_bus' pins are either:
 * unused (on kevin, bob), so the settings is ~harmless
 * used by a different function (on scarlet), which causes probe
   failures (!!)
