can: dev: add sanity check in can_set_static_ctrlmode()

Previous patch removed can_priv::ctrlmode_static to replace it with
can_get_static_ctrlmode().

A condition sine qua non for this to work is that the controller
static modes should never be set in can_priv::ctrlmode_supported
(c.f. the comment on can_priv::ctrlmode_supported which states that it
is for "options that can be *modified* by netlink"). Also, this
condition is already correctly fulfilled by all existing drivers
which rely on the ctrlmode_static feature.

Nonetheless, we added an extra safeguard in can_set_static_ctrlmode()
to return an error value and to warn the developer who would be
adventurous enough to set to static a given feature that is already
set to supported.

The drivers which rely on the static controller mode are then updated
to check the return value of can_set_static_ctrlmode().
