KVM: x86: Update vPMCs when retiring branch instructions

When KVM retires a guest branch instruction through emulation,
increment any vPMCs that are configured to monitor "branch
instructions retired," and update the sample period of those counters
so that they will overflow at the right time.

[jmattson:
  - Split the code to increment "branch instructions retired" into a
    separate commit.
  - Moved/consolidated the calls to kvm_pmu_trigger_event() in the
    emulation of VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME to accommodate the evolution of
    that code.
