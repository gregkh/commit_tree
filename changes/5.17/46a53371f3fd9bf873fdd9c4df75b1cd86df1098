mm/page_counter: remove an incorrect call to propagate_protected_usage()

propagate_protected_usage() is called to propagate the usage change in
the page_counter structure.  But there is a call to this function from
page_counter_try_charge() when there is actually no usage change.  Hence
this call should be removed.
