lib/logic_iomem: Fix operation on 32-bit

On 32-bit, the first entry might be at 0/NULL, but that's
strange and leads to issues, e.g. where we check "if (ret)".
Use a IOREMAP_BIAS/IOREMAP_MASK of 0x80000000UL to avoid
this. This then requires reducing the number of areas (via
MAX_AREAS), but we still have 128 areas, which is enough.
