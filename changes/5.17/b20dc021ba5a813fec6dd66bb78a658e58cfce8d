remoteproc: k3-r5: Extend support for R5F clusters on J721S2 SoCs

The K3 J721S2 SoCs have three dual-core R5F subsystems, one in MCU voltage
domain and the other two in MAIN voltage domain. These R5F clusters are
similar to the R5F clusters in J7200 SoCs.

Compatible Info is updated to support J721S2 SoCs.
