drm/amdgpu: Send Message to SMU on aldebaran passthrough for sbr handling

For Aldebaran chip passthrough case we need to intimate SMU
about special handling for SBR.On older chips we send
LightSBR to SMU, enabling the same for Aldebaran. Slight
difference, compared to previous chips, is on Aldebaran, SMU
would do a heavy reset on SBR. Hence, the word Heavy
instead of Light SBR is used for SMU to differentiate.
