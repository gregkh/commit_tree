samples/bpf: Clean up samples/bpf build failes

Remove xdp_samples_user.o rule redefinition which generates Makefile
warning and instead override TPROGS_CFLAGS. This seems to work fine when
building inside selftests/bpf.

That was one big head-scratcher before I found that generic
Makefile.target hid this surprising specialization for for xdp_samples_user.o.

Main change is to use actual locally installed libbpf headers.

Also drop printk macro re-definition (not even used!).
