habanalabs/gaudi: recover from CPU WD event

There are rare cases where the device CPU's watchdog has expired and as
a result, the watchdog reset has happened and the CPU will now move to
running its preboot f/w.

When that happens, the driver will only know that a heartbeat failure
occurred. As a result, the driver will send a message to the CPU's main
f/w asking it to reset the device, but because the CPU is now running
preboot, it won't respond and the re-initialization process will later
fail when trying to load the f/w.

The solution is to send the request to the preboot as well, only if the
reset was caused because of HB failure.
