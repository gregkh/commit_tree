random: document add_hwgenerator_randomness() with other input functions

The section at the top of random.c which documents the input functions
available does not document add_hwgenerator_randomness() which might lead
a reader to overlook it. Add a brief note about it.

[Jason: reorganize position of function in doc comment and also document
 add_bootloader_randomness() while we're at it.]
