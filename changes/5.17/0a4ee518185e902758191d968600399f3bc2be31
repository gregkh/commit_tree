mm: remove cleancache

Patch series "remove Xen tmem leftovers".

Since the removal of the Xen tmem driver in 2019, the cleancache hooks
are entirely unused, as are large parts of frontswap.  This series
against linux-next (with the folio changes included) removes
cleancaches, and cuts down frontswap to the bits actually used by zswap.

This patch (of 13):

The cleancache subsystem is unused since the removal of Xen tmem driver
in commit 814bbf49dcd0 ("xen: remove tmem driver").
