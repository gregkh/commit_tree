xfs: fix quotaoff mutex usage now that we don't support disabling it

Prior to commit 40b52225e58c ("xfs: remove support for disabling quota
accounting on a mounted file system"), we used the quotaoff mutex to
protect dquot operations against quotaoff trying to pull down dquots as
part of disabling quota.

Now that we only support turning off quota enforcement, the quotaoff
mutex only protects changes in m_qflags/sb_qflags.  We don't need it to
protect dquots, which means we can remove it from setqlimits and the
dquot scrub code.  While we're at it, fix the function that forces
quotacheck, since it should have been taking the quotaoff mutex.
