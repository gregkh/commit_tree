Input: goodix - workaround Cherry Trail devices with a bogus ACPI Interrupt() resource

ACPI/x86 devices with a Cherry Trail SoC should have a GpioInt + a regular
GPIO ACPI resource in their ACPI tables.

Some CHT devices have a bug, where the also is bogus interrupt resource
(likely copied from a previous Bay Trail based generation of the device).

The i2c-core-acpi code will assign the bogus, non-working, interrupt
resource to client->irq. Add a workaround to fix this up.
