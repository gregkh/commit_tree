staging: fbtft: add macro FBTFT_REGISTER_SPI_DRIVER

After 5fa6863ba692 ("spi: Check we have a spi_device_id for each DT
compatible") we need to add spi id_tables. Changing existing macro
FBTFT_REGISTER_DRIVER would have meant to change arguments and
therefore adjust all fbtft drivers.

This patch adds a new and simplified macro FBTFT_REGISTER_SPI_DRIVER
that includes a spi id_table, and in addition to that:
- does not define a platform driver
- uses macro module_spi_driver()
