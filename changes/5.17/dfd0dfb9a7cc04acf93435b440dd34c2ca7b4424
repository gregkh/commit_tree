EDAC/xgene: Fix deferred probing

The driver overrides error codes returned by platform_get_irq_optional()
to -EINVAL for some strange reason, so if it returns -EPROBE_DEFER, the
driver will fail the probe permanently instead of the deferred probing.
Switch to propagating the proper error codes to platform driver code
upwards.
