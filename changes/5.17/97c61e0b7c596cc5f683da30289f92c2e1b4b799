Revert "drm/amdgpu: add modifiers in amdgpu_vkms_plane_init()"

This reverts commit 4046afcebfc3c8c0dd5666c2671b2c192b344f78.

No need to support modifier in virtual kms, otherwise, in SRIOV
mode, when lanuching X server, set crtc will fail due to mismatch
between primary plane modifier and framebuffer modifier.
