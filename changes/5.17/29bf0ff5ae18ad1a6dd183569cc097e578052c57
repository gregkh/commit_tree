ARM: dts: exynos: Rename hsi2c nodes to i2c for Exynos5260

In Device Tree specification it's recommended to use "i2c" name for I2C
nodes. Now that i2c-exynos5 dt-schema binding was added, it shows some
warnings like this when validating HS-I2C nodes:

    hsi2c@xxxxxxxxx: $nodename:0: 'hsi2c@xxxxxxxx' does not match
                                  '^i2c(@.*)?'
    From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/i2c-exynos5.yaml

Rename hsi2c@* to i2c@* to fix those warnings.
