tracing: Use __this_cpu_read() in trace_event_buffer_lock_reserver()

The value read by this_cpu_read() is used later and its use is expected to
stay on the same CPU as being read. But this_cpu_read() does not warn if
it is called without preemption disabled, where as __this_cpu_read() will
check if preemption is disabled on CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT

Currently all callers have preemption disabled, but there may be new
callers in the future that may not.
