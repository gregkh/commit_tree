scsi: mpi3mr: Fault IOC when internal command gets timeout

Save snapdump and fault the controller with the given reason code if it is
already not in the fault or not in asynchronous reset. This ensures that
soft reset is issued from the watchdog thread.  This will also be used to
handle initialization time faults/resets/timeout as in those cases
immediate soft reset invocation is not required.
