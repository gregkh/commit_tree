KVM: x86: nSVM/nVMX: set nested_run_pending on VM entry which is a result of RSM

While RSM induced VM entries are not full VM entries,
they still need to be followed by actual VM entry to complete it,
unlike setting the nested state.

This patch fixes boot of hyperv and SMM enabled
windows VM running nested on KVM, which fail due
to this issue combined with lack of dirty bit setting.
