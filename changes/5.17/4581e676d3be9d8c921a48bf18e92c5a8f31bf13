libbpf: Fix potential uninit memory read

In case of BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL we fill out target result explicitly.
But targ_res itself isn't initialized in such a case, and subsequent
call to bpf_core_patch_insn() might read uninitialized field (like
fail_memsz_adjust in this case). So ensure that targ_res is
zero-initialized for BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL case.

This was reported by Coverity static analyzer.
