iommu/amd: Fix loop timeout issue in iommu_ga_log_enable()

The polling loop for the register change in iommu_ga_log_enable() needs
to have a udelay() in it.  Otherwise the CPU might be faster than the
IOMMU hardware and wrongly trigger the WARN_ON() further down the code
stream. Use a 10us for udelay(), has there is some hardware where
activation of the GA log can take more than a 100ms.

A future optimization should move the activation check of the GA log
to the point where it gets used for the first time. But that is a
bigger change and not suitable for a fix.
