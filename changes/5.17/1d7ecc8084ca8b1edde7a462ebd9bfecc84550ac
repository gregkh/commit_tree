dt-bindings: perf: Add compatible for Arm DSU-110

DSU-110 is the newest and shiniest for Armv9. Its programmer's model is
largely identical to the previous generation of DSUs, so we can treat it
as compatible, but it does have a a handful of extra IMP-DEF PMU events
to call its own. Thanks to the new notion of core complexes, the maximum
number of supported CPUs goes up as well.
