clk: qcom: dispcc: Update the transition delay for MDSS GDSC

On SC7180 we observe black screens because the gdsc is being
enabled/disabled very rapidly and the GDSC FSM state does not work as
expected. This is due to the fact that the GDSC reset value is being
updated from SW.

The recommended transition delay for mdss core gdsc updated for
SC7180/SC7280/SM8250.
