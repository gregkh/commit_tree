topology/sysfs: rework book and drawer topology ifdefery

Provide default defines for the topology_book_[id|cpumask] and
topology_drawer_[id|cpumask] macros just like for each other topology
level.
This way all topology levels are handled in a similar way. Still the
the book and drawer levels are only used on s390, and also the sysfs
attributes are only created on s390. However other architectures may
opt in if wanted.
