bpf, sockmap: Fix return codes from tcp_bpf_recvmsg_parser()

Applications can be confused slightly because we do not always return the
same error code as expected, e.g. what the TCP stack normally returns. For
example on a sock err sk->sk_err instead of returning the sock_error we
return EAGAIN. This usually means the application will 'try again'
instead of aborting immediately. Another example, when a shutdown event
is received we should immediately abort instead of waiting for data when
the user provides a timeout.

These tend to not be fatal, applications usually recover, but introduces
bogus errors to the user or introduces unexpected latency. Before
'c5d2177a72a16' we fell back to the TCP stack when no data was available
so we managed to catch many of the cases here, although with the extra
latency cost of calling tcp_msg_wait_data() first.

To fix lets duplicate the error handling in TCP stack into tcp_bpf so
that we get the same error codes.

These were found in our CI tests that run applications against sockmap
and do longer lived testing, at least compared to test_sockmap that
does short-lived ping/pong tests, and in some of our test clusters
we deploy.

Its non-trivial to do these in a shorter form CI tests that would be
appropriate for BPF selftests, but we are looking into it so we can
ensure this keeps working going forward. As a preview one idea is to
pull in the packetdrill testing which catches some of this.
