mlxsw: Use u16 for local_port field instead of u8

Currently, local_port field is saved as u8, which means that maximum 256
ports can be used.

As preparation for Spectrum-4, which will support more than 256 ports,
local_port field should be extended.

Save local_port as u16 to allow use of additional ports.
