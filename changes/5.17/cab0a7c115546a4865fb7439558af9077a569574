mm: make some vars and functions static or __init

"page_idle_ops" as a global var, but its scope of use within this
document.  So it should be static.

"page_ext_ops" is a var used in the kernel initial phase.  And other
functions are aslo used in the kernel initial phase.  So they should be
__init or __initdata to reclaim memory.
