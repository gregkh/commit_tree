rtc: pxa: fix null pointer dereference

With the latest stable kernel versions the rtc on the PXA based
Zaurus does not work, when booting I see the following kernel messages:

pxa-rtc pxa-rtc: failed to find rtc clock source
pxa-rtc pxa-rtc: Unable to init SA1100 RTC sub-device
pxa-rtc: probe of pxa-rtc failed with error -2
hctosys: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)

I think this is because commit f2997775b111 ("rtc: sa1100: fix possible
race condition") moved the allocation of the rtc_device struct out of
sa1100_rtc_init and into sa1100_rtc_probe. This means that pxa_rtc_probe
also needs to do allocation for the rtc_device struct, otherwise
sa1100_rtc_init will try to dereference a null pointer. This patch adds
that allocation by copying how sa1100_rtc_probe in
drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c does it; after the IRQs are set up a managed
rtc_device is allocated.

I've tested this patch with `qemu-system-arm -machine akita` and with a
real Zaurus SL-C1000 applied to 4.19, 5.4, and 5.10.
