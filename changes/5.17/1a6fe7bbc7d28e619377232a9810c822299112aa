mmc: dw_mmc: Do not wait for DTO in case of error

When running the ARTPEC-8 DWMMC IP version, and a data error interrupt
comes during a data read transfer, there is no guarantee for the data
transfer over interrupt (DTO) to come within the specified data timeout.
This case is handled by the dto_timer handler which will complete the
request with the comment:

 /*
  * If DTO interrupt does NOT come in sending data state,
  * we should notify the driver to terminate current transfer
  * and report a data timeout to the core.
  */

But since the ARTPEC-8 DWMMC IP version, supports an extended TMOUT
register which allows longer timeouts than the non ARTPEC-8 version
does, waiting for the dto_timer to complete the request in error cases
may cause the request to take significantly longer time than necessary.
This is specifically true for the failing steps during tuning of a
device.

Fix this by completing the request when the error interrupt comes. Since
this fix is specific for the ARTPEC-8, a quirk is added.
