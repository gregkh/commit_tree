net/mlx5e: Add recovery flow in case of error CQE

The rep legacy RQ completion handling was missing the appropriate
handling of error CQEs (dump the CQE and queue a recover work), fix it
by calling trigger_report() when needed.

Since all CQE handling flows do the exact same error CQE handling,
extract it to a common helper function.
