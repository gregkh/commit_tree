ASoC: cs4265: Fix the duplicated control name

Currently, the following error messages are seen during boot:

asoc-simple-card sound: control 2:0:0:SPDIF Switch:0 is already present
cs4265 1-004f: ASoC: failed to add widget SPDIF dapm kcontrol SPDIF Switch: -16

Quoting Mark Brown:

"The driver is just plain buggy, it defines both a regular SPIDF Switch
control and a SND_SOC_DAPM_SWITCH() called SPDIF both of which will
create an identically named control, it can never have loaded without
error.  One or both of those has to be renamed or they need to be
merged into one thing."

Fix the duplicated control name by combining the two SPDIF controls here
and move the register bits onto the DAPM widget and have DAPM control them.
