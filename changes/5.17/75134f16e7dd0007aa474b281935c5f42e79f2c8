bpf: Add schedule points in batch ops

syzbot reported various soft lockups caused by bpf batch operations.

 INFO: task kworker/1:1:27 blocked for more than 140 seconds.
 INFO: task hung in rcu_barrier

Nothing prevents batch ops to process huge amount of data,
we need to add schedule points in them.

Note that maybe_wait_bpf_programs(map) calls from
generic_map_delete_batch() can be factorized by moving
the call after the loop.

This will be done later in -next tree once we get this fix merged,
unless there is strong opinion doing this optimization sooner.

Fixes: aa2e93b8e58e ("bpf: Add generic support for update and delete batch ops")
Fixes: cb4d03ab499d ("bpf: Add generic support for lookup batch op")
