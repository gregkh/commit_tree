arm64: perf: Don't register user access sysctl handler multiple times

Commit e2012600810c ("arm64: perf: Add userspace counter access disable
switch") introduced a new 'perf_user_access' sysctl file to enable and
disable direct userspace access to the PMU counters. Sadly, Geert
reports that on his big.LITTLE SoC ('Renesas Salvator-XS w/ R-Car H3'),
the file is created for each PMU type probed, resulting in a splat
during boot:

  | hw perfevents: enabled with armv8_cortex_a53 PMU driver, 7 counters available

Introduce a state variable to track creation of the sysctl file and
ensure that it is only created once.
