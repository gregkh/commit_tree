ia64: topology: use default_groups in kobj_type

There are currently two ways to create a set of sysfs files for a kobj_type,
through the default_attrs field, and the default_groups field.

Move the ia64 topology sysfs code to use default_groups field which has
been the preferred way since aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add support for
default attribute groups to kobj_type") so that we can soon get rid of
the obsolete default_attrs field.
