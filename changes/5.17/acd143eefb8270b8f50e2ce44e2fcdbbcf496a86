selftests/bpf: Fix segfault in bpf_tcp_ca

Since commit ad9a7f96445b ("libbpf: Improve logging around BPF program
loading"), libbpf_debug_print() gets an additional prog_name parameter
but doesn't pass it to printf(). Since the format string now expects two
arguments, printf() may read uninitialized data and segfault. Pass
prog_name through.
