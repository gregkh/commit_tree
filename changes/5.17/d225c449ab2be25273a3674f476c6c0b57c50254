octeontx2-af: Do not fixup all VF action entries

AF modifies all the rules destined for VF to use
the action same as default RSS action. This fixup
was needed because AF only installs default rules with
RSS action. But the action in rules installed by a PF
for its VFs should not be changed by this fixup.
This is because action can be drop or direct to
queue as specified by user(ntuple filters).
This patch fixes that problem.
