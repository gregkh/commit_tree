Revert "net/mlx5e: Block offload of outer header csum for GRE tunnel"

This reverts commit 54e1217b90486c94b26f24dcee1ee5ef5372f832.

Although the NIC doesn't support offload of outer header CSUM, using
gso_partial_features allows offloading the tunnel's segmentation. The
driver relies on the stack CSUM calculation of the outer header. For
this, NETIF_F_GSO_GRE_CSUM must be a member of the device's features.
