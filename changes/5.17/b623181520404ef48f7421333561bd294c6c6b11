bpftool: Update doc (use susbtitutions) and test_bpftool_synctypes.py

test_bpftool_synctypes.py helps detecting inconsistencies in bpftool
between the different list of types and options scattered in the
sources, the documentation, and the bash completion. For options that
apply to all bpftool commands, the script had a hardcoded list of
values, and would use them to check whether the man pages are
up-to-date. When writing the script, it felt acceptable to have this
list in order to avoid to open and parse bpftool's main.h every time,
and because the list of global options in bpftool doesn't change so
often.

However, this is prone to omissions, and we recently added a new
-l|--legacy option which was described in common_options.rst, but not
listed in the options summary of each manual page. The script did not
complain, because it keeps comparing the hardcoded list to the (now)
outdated list in the header file.

To address the issue, this commit brings the following changes:

- Options that are common to all bpftool commands (--json, --pretty, and
  --debug) are moved to a dedicated file, and used in the definition of
  a RST substitution. This substitution is used in the sources of all
  the man pages.

- This list of common options is updated, with the addition of the new
  -l|--legacy option.

- The script test_bpftool_synctypes.py is updated to compare:
    - Options specific to a command, found in C files, for the
      interactive help messages, with the same specific options from the
      relevant man page for that command.
    - Common options, checked just once: the list in main.h is
      compared with the new list in substitutions.rst.
