Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix not using conn_timeout

When using hci_le_create_conn_sync it shall wait for the conn_timeout
since the connection complete may take longer than just 2 seconds.

Also fix the masking of HCI_EV_LE_ENHANCED_CONN_COMPLETE and
HCI_EV_LE_CONN_COMPLETE so they are never both set so we can predict
which one the controller will use in case of HCI_OP_LE_CREATE_CONN.
