s390/ap: add missing virt_to_phys address conversion

The address of the notification-indicator byte is an absolute
address. Therefore convert its virtual to a physical address before
being used with PQAP(AQIC).

Note: this currently doesn't fix a real bug, since virtual addresses
are indentical to physical ones.
