regulator: rohm-generic: remove unused dummies

Function rohm_regulator_set_voltage_sel_restricted() and
rohm_regulator_set_dvs_levels() had inlined dummy implementations for
cases when the real implementation was not configured in.

All of the drivers who issue the call to these functions do SELECT the
real implementation from the Kconfig. There should be no cases where the
real implementation was not selected by the drivers using these
functions - such a situation is likely to be an error which deserves to be
noticed at compile-time.

These dummies could in theory be used for compile-testing the drivers
only (without the generic rohm regulator pieces). However, for such
compile testing we should manually drop the selection from KConfig - and
I guess that if it does not work out-of-the-box, then it is not going to
happen. Especially when there should be no reason to omit
compile-testing the generic rohm_regulator part.

Crash test dummies.
