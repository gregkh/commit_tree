exit: Remove profile_handoff_task

All profile_handoff_task does is notify the task_free_notifier chain.
The helpers task_handoff_register and task_handoff_unregister are used
to add and delete entries from that chain and are never called.

So remove the dead code and make it much easier to read and reason
about __put_task_struct.
