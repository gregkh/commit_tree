coresight: configuration: Update API to introduce load owner concept

Update the existing load API to introduce a "load owner" concept.

This allows the tracking of the loaded configurations and features against
the loading owner type, to allow later unload according to owner.

A list of loaded configurations by owner is created.

The load owner infrastructure will be used in following patches
to implement dynanic load and unload, alongside dependency tracking.
