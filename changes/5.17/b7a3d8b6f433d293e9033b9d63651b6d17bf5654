KVM: nSVM: use vmcb_save_area_cached in nested_vmcb_valid_sregs()

Now that struct vmcb_save_area_cached contains the required
vmcb fields values (done in nested_load_save_from_vmcb12()),
check them to see if they are correct in nested_vmcb_valid_sregs().

While at it, rename nested_vmcb_valid_sregs in nested_vmcb_check_save.
__nested_vmcb_check_save takes the additional @save parameter, so it
is helpful when we want to check a non-svm save state, like in
svm_set_nested_state. The reason for that is that save is the L1
state, not L2, so we check it without moving it to svm->nested.save.
