usb: aspeed-vhub: add qualifier descriptor

USB3 Command Verifier (USB3CV) is the official tool for
USB3 Hub and Device Framework testing.

A high-speed capable device that has different device information
for full-speed and high-speed must have a Device Qualifier Descriptor.

This patch is to support device qualifier to pass
USB3CV - Chapter 9 Test [USB 2 devices] - Device Qualifier Tests.
