udf: Restore i_lenAlloc when inode expansion fails

When we fail to expand inode from inline format to a normal format, we
restore inode to contain the original inline formatting but we forgot to
set i_lenAlloc back. The mismatch between i_lenAlloc and i_size was then
causing further problems such as warnings and lost data down the line.
