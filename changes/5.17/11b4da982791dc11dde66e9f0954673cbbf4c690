drm/amdgpu: partially revert "svm bo enable_signal call condition"

Partially revert commit 5f319c5c21b5909abb43d8aadc92a8aa549ee443.

First of all this is illegal use of RCU to call dma_fence_enable_sw_signaling()
since we don't hold a reference to the fence in question and can crash badly.

Then the code doesn't seem to have the intended effect since only the
exclusive fence is handled, but the KFD fences are always added as shared fence.

Only keep the handling to throw away the content of SVM BOs.
