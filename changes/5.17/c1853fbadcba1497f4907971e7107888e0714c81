watch_queue: Fix to release page in ->release()

When a pipe ring descriptor points to a notification message, the
refcount on the backing page is incremented by the generic get function,
but the release function, which marks the bitmap, doesn't drop the page
ref.

Fix this by calling generic_pipe_buf_release() at the end of
watch_queue_pipe_buf_release().
