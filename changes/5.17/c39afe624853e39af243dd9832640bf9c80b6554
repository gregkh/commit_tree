kconfig: Add `make mod2noconfig` to disable module options

When converting a modular kernel to a monolithic kernel, once the kernel
works without loading any modules, this helps to quickly disable all the
modules before turning off module support entirely.

Refactor conf_rewrite_mod_or_yes to a more general
conf_rewrite_tristates that accepts an old and new state.
