mm/memcg: Convert slab objcgs from struct page to struct slab

page->memcg_data is used with MEMCG_DATA_OBJCGS flag only for slab pages
so convert all the related infrastructure to struct slab. Also use
struct folio instead of struct page when resolving object pointers.

This is not just mechanistic changing of types and names. Now in
mem_cgroup_from_obj() we use folio_test_slab() to decide if we interpret
the folio as a real slab instead of a large kmalloc, instead of relying
on MEMCG_DATA_OBJCGS bit that used to be checked in page_objcgs_check().
Similarly in memcg_slab_free_hook() where we can encounter
kmalloc_large() pages (here the folio slab flag check is implied by
virt_to_slab()). As a result, page_objcgs_check() can be dropped instead
of converted.

To avoid include cycles, move the inline definition of slab_objcgs()
from memcontrol.h to mm/slab.h.
