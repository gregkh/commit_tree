kobject documentation: remove default_attrs information

Since commit aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add support for default attribute
groups to kobj_type") we have been encouraging the use of default_groups
instead of default_attrs, so reflect that information in the
documentation as well so that no new users get added while the kernel is
converted over to not use this field anymore.
