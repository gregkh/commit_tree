objtool: Fix truncated string warning

On GCC 12, the build fails due to a possible truncated string:

    check.c: In function 'validate_call':
    check.c:2865:58: error: '%d' directive output may be truncated writing between 1 and 10 bytes into a region of size 9 [-Werror=format-truncation=]
     2865 |                 snprintf(pvname, sizeof(pvname), "pv_ops[%d]", idx);
          |                                                          ^~

In theory it's a valid bug:

    static char pvname[16];
    int idx;
    ...
    idx = (rel->addend / sizeof(void *));
    snprintf(pvname, sizeof(pvname), "pv_ops[%d]", idx);

There are only 7 chars for %d while it could take up to 9, so the
printed "pv_ops[%d]" string could get truncated.

In reality the bug should never happen, because pv_ops only has ~80
entries, so 7 chars for the integer is more than enough.  Still, it's
worth fixing.  Bump the buffer size by 2 bytes to silence the warning.
