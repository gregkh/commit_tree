can: gs_usb: gs_can_start_xmit(): zero-initialize hf->{flags,reserved}

No information is deliberately sent in hf->flags in host -> device
communications, but the open-source candleLight firmware echoes it
back, which can result in the GS_CAN_FLAG_OVERFLOW flag being set and
generating spurious ERRORFRAMEs.

While there also initialize the reserved member with 0.
