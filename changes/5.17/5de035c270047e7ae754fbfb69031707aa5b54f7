ASoC: bcm: Use platform_get_irq() to get the interrupt

platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_IRQ, ..) relies on static
allocation of IRQ resources in DT core code, this causes an issue
when using hierarchical interrupt domains using "interrupts" property
in the node as this bypasses the hierarchical setup and messes up the
irq chaining.

In preparation for removal of static setup of IRQ resource from DT core
code use platform_get_irq().

While at it also drop "r_irq" member from struct bcm_i2s_priv as there
are no users of it.
