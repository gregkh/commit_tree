ASoC: cs35l41: Create shared function for errata patches

ASoC and HDA systems require the same errata patches, so
move it to the shared code using a function the correctly
applies the patches by revision

Also, move CS35L41_DSP1_CCM_CORE_CTRL write to errata
patch function as is required to be written at boot,
but not in regmap_register_patch sequence as will affect
waking up from hibernation
