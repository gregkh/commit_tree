clocksource: Reduce the default clocksource_watchdog() retries to 2

With the previous patch, there is an extra watchdog read in each retry.
Now the total number of clocksource reads is increased to 4 per iteration.
In order to avoid increasing the clock skew check overhead, the default
maximum number of retries is reduced from 3 to 2 to maintain the same 12
clocksource reads in the worst case.
