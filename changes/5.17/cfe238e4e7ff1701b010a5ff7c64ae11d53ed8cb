clk: samsung: Make exynos850_register_cmu shared

Rename exynos850_register_cmu to exynos_arm64_register_cmu and move it
to a new file called "clk-exynos-arm64.c".

This should have no functional changes, but it will allow this code to
be shared between other arm64 Exynos SoCs, like the Exynos7885 and
possibly ExynosAuto V9.
