perf stat: No need to setup affinities when starting a workload

I.e. the simple:

  $ perf stat sleep 1

Uses a dummy CPU map and thus there is no need to setup/cleanup
affinities to avoid IPIs, etc.

With this we're down to a sched_getaffinity() call, in the libnuma
initialization, that probably can be removed in a followup patch.
