net: phy: marvell: Fix invalid comparison in the resume and suspend functions

This bug resulted in only the current mode being resumed and suspended when
the PHY supported both fiber and copper modes and when the PHY only supported
copper mode the fiber mode would incorrectly be attempted to be resumed and
suspended.

Fixes: 3758be3dc162 ("Marvell phy: add functions to suspend and resume both interfaces: fiber and copper links.")
