scsi: ufs: Improve SCSI abort handling further

Release resources when aborting a command. Make sure that aborted commands
are completed once by clearing the corresponding tag bit from
hba->outstanding_reqs. This patch is an improved version of commit
3ff1f6b6ba6f ("scsi: ufs: core: Improve SCSI abort handling").
