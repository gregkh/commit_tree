btrfs: zoned: sink zone check into btrfs_repair_one_zone

Sink zone check into btrfs_repair_one_zone() so we don't need to do it
in all callers.

Also as btrfs_repair_one_zone() doesn't return a sensible error, make it
a boolean function and return false in case it got called on a non-zoned
filesystem and true on a zoned filesystem.
