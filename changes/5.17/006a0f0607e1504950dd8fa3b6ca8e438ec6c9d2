KVM: x86: avoid out of bounds indices for fixed performance counters

Because IceLake has 4 fixed performance counters but KVM only
supports 3, it is possible for reprogram_fixed_counters to pass
to reprogram_fixed_counter an index that is out of bounds for the
fixed_pmc_events array.

Ultimately intel_find_fixed_event, which is the only place that uses
fixed_pmc_events, handles this correctly because it checks against the
size of fixed_pmc_events anyway.  Every other place operates on the
fixed_counters[] array which is sized according to INTEL_PMC_MAX_FIXED.
However, it is cleaner if the unsupported performance counters are culled
early on in reprogram_fixed_counters.
