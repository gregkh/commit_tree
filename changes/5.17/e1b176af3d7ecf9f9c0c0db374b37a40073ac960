crypto: qat - exchange ring-to-service mappings over PFVF

In addition to retrieving the device capabilities, a VF may also need to
retrieve the mapping of its ring pairs to crypto and or compression
services in order to work properly.

Make the VF receive the ring-to-service mappings from the PF by means of a
new REQ_RING_SVC_MAP Block Message and add the request and response
logic on VF and PF respectively. This change requires to bump the PFVF
protocol to version 4.
