drm/simpledrm: Support virtual screen sizes

Add constants for the maximum size of the shadow-plane surface
size. Useful for shadow planes with virtual screen sizes. The
current sizes are 4096 scanlines with 4096 pixels each. This
seems reasonable for current hardware, but can be increased as
necessary.

In simpledrm, set the maximum framebuffer size from the constants
for shadow planes. Implements support for virtual screen sizes and
page flipping on the fbdev console.

v3:
	* use decimal numbers for shadow-plane constants (Noralf)
