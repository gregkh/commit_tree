PCI: xilinx-nwl: Simplify code and fix a memory leak

Allocate space for bitmap in struct nwl_msi at probe time instead of
dynamically allocating the memory at runtime.

This simplifies code (especially error handling paths) and avoid some
open-coded arithmetic in allocator arguments.

This also fixes a potential memory leak. The bitmap was never freed. It
is now part of a managed resource.
