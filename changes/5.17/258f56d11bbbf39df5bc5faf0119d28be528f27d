Bluetooth: aosp: Support AOSP Bluetooth Quality Report

This patch adds the support of the AOSP Bluetooth Quality Report
(BQR) events.

Multiple vendors have supported the AOSP Bluetooth Quality Report.
When a Bluetooth controller supports the capability, it can enable
the aosp capability through hci_set_aosp_capable. Then hci_core will
set up the hdev->aosp_set_quality_report callback through aosp_do_open
if the controller responds to support the quality report capability.

Note that Intel also supports a distinct telemetry quality report
specification. Intel sets up the hdev->set_quality_report callback
in the btusb driver module.
