drm/amdkfd: process_info lock not needed for svm

process_info->lock is used to protect kfd_bo_list, vm_list_head, n_vms
and userptr valid/inval list, svm_range_restore_work and
svm_range_set_attr don't access those, so do not need to take
process_info lock. This will avoid potential circular locking issue.
