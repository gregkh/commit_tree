crypto: kdf - Add key derivation self-test support code

As a preparation to add the key derivation implementations, the
self-test data structure definition and the common test code is made
available.

The test framework follows the testing applied by the NIST CAVP test
approach.

The structure of the test code follows the implementations found in
crypto/testmgr.c|h. In case the KDF implementations will be made
available via a kernel crypto API templates, the test code is intended
to be merged into testmgr.c|h.
