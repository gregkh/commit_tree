gpu: host1x: Add initial runtime PM and OPP support

Add runtime PM and OPP support to the Host1x driver. For the starter we
will keep host1x always-on because dynamic power management require a major
refactoring of the driver code since lot's of code paths are missing the
RPM handling and we're going to remove some of these paths in the future.
