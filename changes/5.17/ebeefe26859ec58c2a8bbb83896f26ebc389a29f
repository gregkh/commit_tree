media: rcar-csi2: Add warning for PHY speed less than minimum

Add a warning message when the selected PHY speed is less
than supported minimum PHY speed given in the hsfreq table[1].

For raspberry pi camera capture on Kingfisher board with resolution
640x480, the calculated PHY speed is 48 mbps which is less than
the minimum PHY speed 80 Mbps from the table[1]. But in this cases
capture is successful.
