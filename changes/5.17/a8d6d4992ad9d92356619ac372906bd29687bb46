hwmon: (mr75203) fix wrong power-up delay value

In the file mr75203.c we have a macro named POWER_DELAY_CYCLE_256,
the correct value should be 0x100. The register ip_tmr is expressed
in units of IP clk cycles, in accordance with the datasheet.
Typical power-up delays for Temperature Sensor are 256 cycles i.e. 0x100.
