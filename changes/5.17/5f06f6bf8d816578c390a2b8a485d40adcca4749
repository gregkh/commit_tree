iwlwifi: mvm: don't send SAR GEO command for 3160 devices

SAR GEO offsets are not supported on 3160 devices.  The code was
refactored and caused us to start sending the command anyway, which
causes a FW assertion failure.  Fix that only considering this feature
supported on FW API with major version is 17 if the device is not
3160.

Additionally, fix the caller of iwl_mvm_sar_geo_init() so that it
checks for the return value, which it was ignoring.
