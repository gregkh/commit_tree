net: ipa: fix a build dependency

An IPA build problem arose in the linux-next tree the other day.
The problem is that a recent commit adds a new dependency on some
code, and the Kconfig file for IPA doesn't reflect that dependency.
As a result, some configurations can fail to build (particularly
when COMPILE_TEST is enabled).

The recent patch adds calls to qmp_get(), qmp_put(), and qmp_send(),
and those are built based on the QCOM_AOSS_QMP config option.  If
that symbol is not defined, stubs are defined, so we just need to
ensure QCOM_AOSS_QMP is compatible with QCOM_IPA, or it's not
defined.
