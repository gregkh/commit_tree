net/mlx5: DR, Fix the threshold that defines when pool sync is initiated

When deciding whether to start syncing and actually free all the "hot"
ICM chunks, we need to consider the type of the ICM chunks that we're
dealing with. For instance, the amount of available ICM for MODIFY_ACTION
is significantly lower than the usual STE ICM, so the threshold should
account for that - otherwise we can deplete MODIFY_ACTION memory just by
creating and deleting the same modify header action in a continuous loop.

This patch replaces the hard-coded threshold with a dynamic value.
