samples/bpf: xdpsock: Add clockid selection support

User specifies the clock selection by using -w CLOCK or --clock=CLOCK
where CLOCK=[REALTIME, TAI, BOOTTIME, MONOTONIC].

The default CLOCK selection is MONOTONIC.

The implementation of clock selection parsing is borrowed from
iproute2/tc/q_taprio.c
