drm/i915: Move iCLKIP readout to the pch code

Move the lpt_get_iclkip() call from hsw_crt_get_config()
since that's where we have the lpt_program_iclkip() call
as well.

Tehcnically this isn't perhaps quite right since iCLKIP
is providing the CRT dotclock. So one can argue all of
it should be directly in intel_crt.c. But since the CRT
port is the only one on the PCH sticking it all into the
PCH code seems OK.
