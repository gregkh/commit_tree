lsm: security_task_getsecid_subj() -> security_current_getsecid_subj()

The security_task_getsecid_subj() LSM hook invites misuse by allowing
callers to specify a task even though the hook is only safe when the
current task is referenced.  Fix this by removing the task_struct
argument to the hook, requiring LSM implementations to use the
current task.  While we are changing the hook declaration we also
rename the function to security_current_getsecid_subj() in an effort
to reinforce that the hook captures the subjective credentials of the
current task and not an arbitrary task on the system.
