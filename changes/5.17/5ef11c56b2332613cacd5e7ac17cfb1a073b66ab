r8169: Avoid misuse of pm_ptr() macro

The pm_ptr() macro should be used when the suspend and resume functions
can be compiled independently of the CONFIG_PM Kconfig option.

In the case of this driver, the suspend and resume functions are inside
a section protected by a #ifdef CONFIG_PM guard. Therefore pm_ptr()
should not be used.
