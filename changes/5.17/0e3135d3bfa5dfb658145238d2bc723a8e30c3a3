bpf: Fix possible race in inc_misses_counter

It seems inc_misses_counter() suffers from same issue fixed in
the commit d979617aa84d ("bpf: Fixes possible race in update_prog_stats()
for 32bit arches"):
As it can run while interrupts are enabled, it could
be re-entered and the u64_stats syncp could be mangled.

Fixes: 9ed9e9ba2337 ("bpf: Count the number of times recursion was prevented")
