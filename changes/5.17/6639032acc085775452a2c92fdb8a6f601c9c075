virtio-mem: prepare page onlining code for granularity smaller than MAX_ORDER - 1

Let's prepare our page onlining code for subblock size smaller than
MAX_ORDER - 1: we'll get called for a MAX_ORDER - 1 page but might have
some subblocks in the range plugged and some unplugged. In that case,
fallback to subblock granularity to properly only expose the plugged
parts to the buddy.
