sched, kcsan: Enable memory barrier instrumentation

There's no fundamental reason to disable KCSAN for scheduler code,
except for excessive noise and performance concerns (instrumenting
scheduler code is usually a good way to stress test KCSAN itself).

However, several core sched functions imply memory barriers that are
invisible to KCSAN without instrumentation, but are required to avoid
false positives. Therefore, unconditionally enable instrumentation of
memory barriers in scheduler code. Also update the comment to reflect
this and be a bit more brief.
