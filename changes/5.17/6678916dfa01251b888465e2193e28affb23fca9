drm/i915: Move pipe/transcoder/abox masks under intel_device_info.display

Collect the dipslay related mask under the display sub-structure
in intel_device_info.

Note that there is a slight change in behaviour in that we zero
out .display entirely when !HAS_DISPLAY (aka. pipe_mask==0), so
now we also zero out the other masks (although cpu_transocder_mask
should already be zero of pipe_mask is zero). abox_mask is
only used by the display core init when HAS_DISPLAY is true, so
the actual behaviour of the system shouldn't change despite the
zeroing of these masks.

There is a lot more display stuff directly in device info that
could be moved over. Maybe someone else will be inspired to do it...
