btrfs: only update i_size in truncate paths that care

We currently will update the i_size of the inode as we truncate it down,
however we skip this if we're calling btrfs_truncate_inode_items from
the tree log code.  However we also don't care about this in the case of
evict.  Instead keep track of this value in the btrfs_truncate_control
and then have btrfs_truncate() and the free space cache truncate path
both do the i_size update themselves.
