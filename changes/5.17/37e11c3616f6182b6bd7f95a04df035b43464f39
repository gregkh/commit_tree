block: call blk_exit_queue() before freeing q->stats

blk_stat_disable_accounting() is added in commit 68497092bde9
("block: make queue stat accounting a reference"), and called in
kyber_exit_sched().

So we have to free q->stats after elevator is unloaded from
blk_exit_queue() in blk_release_queue(). Otherwise kernel panic
is caused.
