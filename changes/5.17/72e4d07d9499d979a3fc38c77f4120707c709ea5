platform/x86: think-lmi: Prevent underflow in index_store()

There needs to be a check to prevent negative offsets for
setting->index.  I have reviewed this code and I think that the
"if (block->instance_count <= instance)" check in __query_block() will
prevent this from resulting in an out of bounds access.  But it's
still worth fixing.
