perf metric: Fix metric_leader

Multiple events may have a metric_leader to aggregate into.

This happens for uncore events where, for example, uncore_imc is
expanded into uncore_imc_0, uncore_imc_1, etc.

Such events all have the same metric_id and should aggregate into the
first event.

The change introducing metric_ids had a bug where the metric_id was
compared to itself, creating an always true condition.

Correct this by comparing the event in the metric_evlist and the
metric_leader.
