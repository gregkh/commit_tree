block: make queue stat accounting a reference

kyber turns on IO statistics when it is loaded on a queue, which means
that even if kyber is then later unloaded, we're still stuck with stats
enabled on the queue.

Change the account enabled from a bool to an int, and pair the enable call
with the equivalent disable call. This ensures that stats gets turned off
again appropriately.
