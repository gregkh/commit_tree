xen/x86: detect support for extended destination ID

Xen allows the usage of some previously reserved bits in the IO-APIC
RTE and the MSI address fields in order to store high bits for the
target APIC ID. Such feature is already implemented by QEMU/KVM and
HyperV, so in order to enable it just add the handler that checks for
it's presence.
