PM: core: Remove DEFINE_UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() macro

The deprecated UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() macro uses the provided callbacks
for both runtime PM and system sleep, which is very likely to be a
mistake, as a system sleep can be triggered while a given device is
already PM-suspended, which would cause the suspend callback to be
called twice.

The amount of users of UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() is also tiny (16
occurences) compared to the number of places where
SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() is used with pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
pm_runtime_force_resume(), which makes me think that none of these cases
are actually valid.

As the new macro DEFINE_UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() which was introduced to
replace UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() is currently unused, remove it before
someone starts to use it in yet another invalid case.
