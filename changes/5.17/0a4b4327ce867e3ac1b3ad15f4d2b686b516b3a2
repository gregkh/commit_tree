powerpc/64s: Implement PMU override command line option

It can be useful in simulators (with very constrained environments)
to allow some PMCs to run from boot so they can be sampled directly
by a test harness, rather than having to run perf.

A previous change freezes counters at boot by default, so provide
a boot time option to un-freeze (plus a bit more flexibility).
