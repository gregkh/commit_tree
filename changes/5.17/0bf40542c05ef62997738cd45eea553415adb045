perf: Mute libbpf API deprecations temporarily

Libbpf development version was bumped to 0.7 in c93faaaf2f67
("libbpf: Deprecate bpf_prog_load_xattr() API"), activating a bunch of
previously scheduled deprecations. Most APIs are pretty straightforward
to replace with newer APIs, but perf has a complicated mixed setup with
libbpf used both as static and shared configurations, which makes it
non-trivial to migrate the APIs.

Further, bpf_program__set_prep() needs more involved refactoring, which
will require help from Arnaldo and/or Jiri.

So for now, mute deprecation warnings and work on migrating perf off of
deprecated APIs separately with the input from owners of the perf tool.

Fixes: c93faaaf2f67 ("libbpf: Deprecate bpf_prog_load_xattr() API")
