hwmon: (pmbus) Clear pmbus fault/warning bits after read

Almost all fault/warning bits in pmbus status registers remain set even
after fault/warning condition are removed. As per pmbus specification
these faults must be cleared by user.
Modify hwmon behavior to clear fault/warning bit after fetching data if
fault/warning bit was set. This allows to get fresh data in next read.
