EDAC/sifive: Fix non-kernel-doc comment

scripts/kernel-doc complains about a comment that begins with "/**"
but is not in kernel-doc format, so correct it.

Prevents this warning:

  drivers/edac/sifive_edac.c:23: warning: This comment starts with '/**', \
  but isn't a kernel-doc comment. Refer Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst
    * EDAC error callback
