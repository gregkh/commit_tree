KVM: x86: Register Processor Trace interrupt hook iff PT enabled in guest

Override the Processor Trace (PT) interrupt handler for guest mode if and
only if PT is configured for host+guest mode, i.e. is being used
independently by both host and guest.  If PT is configured for system
mode, the host fully controls PT and must handle all events.
