net: dsa: felix: restrict psfp rules on ingress port

PSFP rules take effect on the streams from any port of VSC9959 switch.
This patch use ingress port to limit the rule only active on this port.

Each stream can only match two ingress source ports in VSC9959. Streams
from lowest port gets the configuration of SFID pointed by MAC Table
lookup and streams from highest port gets the configuration of (SFID+1)
pointed by MAC Table lookup. This patch defines the PSFP rule on highest
port as dummy rule, which means that it does not modify the MAC table.
