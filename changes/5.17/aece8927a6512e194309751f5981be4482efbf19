iwlwifi: parse error tables from debug TLVs

With more things being added, we're no longer going to duplicate
the error tables from the debug TLVs nor send them at runtime.
Use the debug TLVs to find the locations of the error tables. As
we've never released firmware using IWL_UCODE_TLV_TCM_DEBUG_ADDRS
just remove that entirely.
