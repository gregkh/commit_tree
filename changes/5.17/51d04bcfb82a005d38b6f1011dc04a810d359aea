dt-bindings: clk/ingenic: Add MDMA and BDMA clocks

The Ingenic JZ4760 and JZ4770 both have an extra DMA core named BDMA
dedicated to the NAND and BCH controller, but which can also do
memory-to-memory transfers. The JZ4760 additionally has a DMA core named
MDMA dedicated to memory-to-memory transfers. The programming manual for
the JZ4770 does have a bit for a MDMA clock, but does not seem to have
the hardware wired in.

Add macros for the MDMA and BDMA clocks to the dt-bindings include
files, so that they can be used within Device Tree files.
