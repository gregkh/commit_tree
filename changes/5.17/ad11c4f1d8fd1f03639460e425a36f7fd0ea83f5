net/mlx5e: Lag, Only handle events from highest priority multipath entry

There could be multiple multipath entries but changing the port affinity
for each one doesn't make much sense and there should be a default one.
So only track the entry with lowest priority value.
The commit doesn't affect existing users with a single entry.
