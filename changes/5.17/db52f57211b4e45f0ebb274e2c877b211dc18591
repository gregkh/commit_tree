bpf: Remove config check to enable bpf support for branch records

Branch data available to BPF programs can be very useful to get stack traces
out of userspace application.

Commit fff7b64355ea ("bpf: Add bpf_read_branch_records() helper") added BPF
support to capture branch records in x86. Enable this feature also for other
architectures as well by removing checks specific to x86.

If an architecture doesn't support branch records, bpf_read_branch_records()
still has appropriate checks and it will return an -EINVAL in that scenario.
Based on UAPI helper doc in include/uapi/linux/bpf.h, unsupported architectures
should return -ENOENT in such case. Hence, update the appropriate check to
return -ENOENT instead.

Selftest 'perf_branches' result on power9 machine which has the branch stacks
support:

 - Before this patch:

  [command]# ./test_progs -t perf_branches
   #88/1 perf_branches/perf_branches_hw:FAIL
   #88/2 perf_branches/perf_branches_no_hw:OK
   #88 perf_branches:FAIL
  Summary: 0/1 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 1 FAILED

 - After this patch:

  [command]# ./test_progs -t perf_branches
   #88/1 perf_branches/perf_branches_hw:OK
   #88/2 perf_branches/perf_branches_no_hw:OK
   #88 perf_branches:OK
  Summary: 1/2 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED

Selftest 'perf_branches' result on power9 machine which doesn't have branch
stack report:

 - After this patch:

  [command]# ./test_progs -t perf_branches
   #88/1 perf_branches/perf_branches_hw:SKIP
   #88/2 perf_branches/perf_branches_no_hw:OK
   #88 perf_branches:OK
  Summary: 1/1 PASSED, 1 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED
