usb: dwc2: drd: restore role and overrides upon resume

Override enable bits may not be restored when going to low power mode
(e.g. when in DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE).
These bits are set when probing/initializing drd (role switch). Restore
them upon resume from low power mode (in case these have been lost).

To achieve this, the last known role is restored upon resume. And the
override enable bits are always set when configuring aval, bval and vbval.

When resuming, forcing the role should be done only once, or this can cause
port changes in HOST mode for instance.
So, only restore FORCEDEVMODE/FORCEHOSTMODE when role_sw is unused
