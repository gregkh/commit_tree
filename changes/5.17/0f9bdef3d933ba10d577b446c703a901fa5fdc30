KVM: Wait 'til the bitter end to initialize the "new" memslot

Initialize the "new" memslot in the !DELETE path only after the various
sanity checks have passed.  This will allow a future commit to allocate
@new dynamically without having to copy a memslot, and without having to
deal with freeing @new in error paths and in the "nothing to change" path
that's hiding in the sanity checks.

No functional change intended.
