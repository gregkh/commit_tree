scsi: message: fusion: mptctl: Use dma_alloc_coherent()

In [1], Christoph Hellwig has proposed to remove the wrappers in
include/linux/pci-dma-compat.h.

Some reasons why this API should be removed have been given by Julia
Lawall in [2].

When memory is allocated in kbuf_alloc_2_sgl() GFP_KERNEL can be used
because this function already uses the GFP_USER flag for some memory
allocation and not spin_lock is taken in the between.

When memory is allocated in mptctl_do_mpt_command() GFP_KERNEL can be used
because this function already uses copy_from_user() and this function can
sleep.

When memory is allocated in mptctl_hp_hostinfo() GFP_KERNEL can be used
because this function already uses mpt_config() and this function has an
explicit might_sleep().

When memory is allocated in mptctl_hp_targetinfo() GFP_KERNEL can be used
because this function already uses mpt_config() and this function has an
explicit might_sleep().
