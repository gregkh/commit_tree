drm/i915: Clean up the {ilk,lpt}_pch_enable() calling convention

Use the clean "atomic_state+crtc" approach of passing
arguments to the top level PCH modeset code.

And while at it we can also just pass the whole crtc to
ilk_disable_pch_transcoder().

v2: Elimiate double space between function args (Dave)
