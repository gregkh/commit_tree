fscache: Implement cache registration

Implement a register of caches and provide functions to manage it.

Two functions are provided for the cache backend to use:

 (1) Acquire a cache cookie:

	struct fscache_cache *fscache_acquire_cache(const char *name)

     This gets the cache cookie for a cache of the specified name and moves
     it to the preparation state.  If a nameless cache cookie exists, that
     will be given this name and used.

 (2) Relinquish a cache cookie:

	void fscache_relinquish_cache(struct fscache_cache *cache);

     This relinquishes a cache cookie, cleans it and makes it available if
     it's still referenced by a network filesystem.

Note that network filesystems don't deal with cache cookies directly, but
rather go straight to the volume registration.
