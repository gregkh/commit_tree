exit: Rename complete_and_exit to kthread_complete_and_exit

Update complete_and_exit to call kthread_exit instead of do_exit.

Change the name to reflect this change in functionality.  All of the
users of complete_and_exit are causing the current kthread to exit so
this change makes it clear what is happening.

Move the implementation of kthread_complete_and_exit from
kernel/exit.c to to kernel/kthread.c.  As this function is kthread
specific it makes most sense to live with the kthread functions.

There are no functional change.
