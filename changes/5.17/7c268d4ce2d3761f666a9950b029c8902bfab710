ext4: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ext4_fill_super()

By mistake we fail to return an error from ext4_fill_super() in case
that ext4_alloc_sbi() fails to allocate a new sbi. Instead we just set
the ret variable and allow the function to continue which will later
lead to a NULL pointer dereference. Fix it by returning -ENOMEM in the
case ext4_alloc_sbi() fails.
