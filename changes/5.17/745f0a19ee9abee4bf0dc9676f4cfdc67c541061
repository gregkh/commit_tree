net: hns3: refactor VF cmdq resource APIs with new common APIs

This patch uses common cmdq resource allocate/free/query APIs to replace
the old APIs in VF cmdq module and deletes the old cmdq resource APIs.
Still we kept hclgevf_cmd_setup_basic_desc name as a seam API to avoid too
many meaningless replacement.
