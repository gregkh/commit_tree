powerpc/64s: Keep AMOR SPR a constant ~0 at runtime

This register controls supervisor SPR modifications, and as such is only
relevant for KVM. KVM always sets AMOR to ~0 on guest entry, and never
restores it coming back out to the host, so it can be kept constant and
avoid the mtSPR in KVM guest entry.
