ASoC: cs42l42: Report initial jack state

When a jack handler is registered in cs42l42_set_jack() the
initial state should be reported if an attached headphone/headset
has already been detected.

The jack detect sequence takes around 1 second: typically long
enough for the machine driver to probe and register the jack handler
in time to receive the first report from the interrupt handler. So
it is possible on some systems that the correct initial state was seen
simply because of lucky timing. Modular builds were more likely to
miss the reporting of the initial state.
