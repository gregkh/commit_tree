zsmalloc: Stop using slab fields in struct page

The ->freelist and ->units members of struct page are for the use of
slab only.  I'm not particularly familiar with zsmalloc, so generate the
same code by using page->index to store 'page' (page->index and
page->freelist are at the same offset in struct page).  This should be
cleaned up properly at some point by somebody who is familiar with
zsmalloc.
