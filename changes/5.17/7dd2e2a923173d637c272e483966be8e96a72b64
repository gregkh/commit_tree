scsi: lpfc: Trigger SLI4 firmware dump before doing driver cleanup

Extraneous teardown routines are present in the firmware dump path causing
altered states in firmware captures.

When a firmware dump is requested via sysfs, trigger the dump immediately
without tearing down structures and changing adapter state.

The driver shall rely on pre-existing firmware error state clean up
handlers to restore the adapter.
