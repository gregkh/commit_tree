KVM: arm64: Provide {get,put}_page() stubs for early hyp allocator

In nVHE protected mode, the EL2 code uses a temporary allocator during
boot while re-creating its stage-1 page-table. Unfortunately, the
hyp_vmmemap is not ready to use at this stage, so refcounting pages
is not possible. That is not currently a problem because hyp stage-1
mappings are never removed, which implies refcounting of page-table
pages is unnecessary.

In preparation for allowing hypervisor stage-1 mappings to be removed,
provide stub implementations for {get,put}_page() in the early allocator.
