erofs: fix small compressed files inlining

Prior to ztailpacking feature, it's enough that each lcluster has
two pclusters at most, and the last pcluster should be turned into
an uncompressed pcluster when necessary. For example,
  _________________________________________________
 |_ pcluster n-2 _|_ pcluster n-1 _|____ EOFed ____|

which should be converted into:
  _________________________________________________
 |_ pcluster n-2 _|_ pcluster n-1 (uncompressed)' _|

That is fine since either pcluster n-1 or (uncompressed)' takes one
physical block.

However, after ztailpacking was supported, the game is changed since
the last pcluster can be inlined now. And such case above is quite
common for inlining small files. Therefore, in order to inline more
effectively, special EOF lclusters are now supported which can have
three parts at most, as illustrated below:
  _________________________________________________
 |_ pcluster n-2 _|_ pcluster n-1 _|____ EOFed ____|
                                   ^ i_size

Actually similar code exists in Yue Hu's original patchset [1], but I
removed this part on purpose. After evaluating more real cases with
small files, I've changed my mind.
