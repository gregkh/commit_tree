drm/i915: Drop stealing of bits from i915_sw_fence function pointer

Rather than stealing bits from i915_sw_fence function pointer use
separate fields for function pointer and flags. If using two different
fields, the 4 byte alignment for the i915_sw_fence function pointer can
also be dropped.

v2:
 (CI)
  - Set new function field rather than flags in __i915_sw_fence_init
v3:
 (Tvrtko)
  - Remove BUG_ON(!fence->flags) in reinit as that will now blow up
  - Only define fence->flags if CONFIG_DRM_I915_SW_FENCE_CHECK_DAG is
    defined
v4:
  - Rebase, resend for CI
