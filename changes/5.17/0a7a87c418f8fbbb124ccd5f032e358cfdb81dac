staging: r8188eu: clean up blinking macros

Clean up the macros that check the blinking mode of a LED.

The macro IS_LED_BLINKING is not used and can be removed.

The IS_LED_WPS_BLINKING macro is used only by rtw_led.c. Move the macro
into this file. The macro parameter is always a struct LED_871x *,
there's no need for a cast. Rename the parameter to l and put it in
parentheses, which is good practice for macro parameters.
