net: dsa: hide dp->bridge_dev and dp->bridge_num in drivers behind helpers

The location of the bridge device pointer and number is going to change.
It is not going to be kept individually per port, but in a common
structure allocated dynamically and which will have lockdep validation.

Use the helpers to access these elements so that we have a migration
path to the new organization.
