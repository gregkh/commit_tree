platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Accept ibm_init_struct.init() returning -ENODEV

Commit 79f960e29cfc ("platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Convert platform driver
to use dev_groups") accidentally modified tpacpi_kbdlang_init() causing it
to return -ENODEV instead of 0 on machines without kbdlang support
(which are most of them).

ibm_init() sees this -ENODEV as an error causing the entire module to not
load, not good.

Note that technically tpacpi_kbdlang_init() was already buggy before, it
should have returned 1 instead of 0 if the feature is not present.

Rather then fixing tpacpi_kbdlang_init() though, IMHO it is bettter to
just make ibm_init() treat -ENODEV as 1 to fix the issue; and then in
a followup commit also change all the existing "return 1"s from
ibm_init_struct.init() callbacks to "return -ENODEV" as -ENODEV clearly
states what it going on where as a magic return of "1" requires a deep
dive into the code to figure out what is going on.

This will also allow removing some extra ifs to translate -ENODEV to
return 1 in a couple of init() callbacks.
