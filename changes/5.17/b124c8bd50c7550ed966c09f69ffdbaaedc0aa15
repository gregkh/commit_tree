pinctrl: Sort Kconfig and Makefile entries alphabetically

Sort Kconfig and Makefile entries alphabetically for better maintenance
in the future.

While at it fix some style issues, such as:
  - "Say Y"/"Say yes"/"Say Yes" --> "Say Y"
  - "pullup/pulldown" --> "pull-up and pull-down"
  - wrong indentation
