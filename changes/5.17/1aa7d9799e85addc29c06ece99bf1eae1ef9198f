scsi: efct: Remove useless DMA-32 fallback configuration

As stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask never fails if
dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.  So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also
fail for the same reason.

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.

While at it, return the error code returned by dma_set_mask_and_coherent()
instead of -1.
