net: dsa: replace phylink_get_interfaces() with phylink_get_caps()

Phylink needs slightly more information than phylink_get_interfaces()
allows us to get from the DSA drivers - we need the MAC capabilities.
Replace the phylink_get_interfaces() method with phylink_get_caps() to
allow DSA drivers to fill in the phylink_config MAC capabilities field
as well.
