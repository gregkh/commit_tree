ASoC: msm8916-wcd-analog: Use separate outputs for HPH_L/HPH_R

The analog codec has separate output paths for the left headphone channel
(HPH_L) and the right headphone channel (HPH_R). While they are usually
used together for actual headphones output, some devices also have an
analog speaker amplifier connected to one of the headphone channels.

To allow modelling that properly (and to avoid powering on the unneeded
output path), HPH_L and HPH_R should be represented by separate outputs
rather than a shared HEADPHONE output that always activates both paths.
