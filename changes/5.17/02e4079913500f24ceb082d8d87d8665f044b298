fs: remove unused low-level mapping helpers

Now that we ported all places to use the new low-level mapping helpers
that are able to support filesystems mounted with an idmapping we can
remove the old low-level mapping helpers. With the removal of these old
helpers we also conclude the renaming of the mapping helpers we started
in commit a65e58e791a1 ("fs: document and rename fsid helpers").
