perf machine: Use path__join() to compose a path instead of snprintf(dir, '/', filename)

Its more intention revealing, and if we're interested in the odd cases
where this may end up truncating we can do debug checks at one
centralized place.

Motivation, of all the container builds, fedora rawhide started
complaining of:

  util/machine.c: In function ‘machine__create_modules’:
  util/machine.c:1419:50: error: ‘%s’ directive output may be truncated writing up to 255 bytes into a region of size between 0 and 4095 [-Werror=format-truncation=]
   1419 |                 snprintf(path, sizeof(path), "%s/%s", dir_name, dent->d_name);
        |                                                  ^~

                   from util/machine.c:7:
  In function ‘snprintf’,
      inlined from ‘maps__set_modules_path_dir’ at util/machine.c:1419:3,
      inlined from ‘machine__set_modules_path’ at util/machine.c:1473:9,

  /usr/include/bits/stdio2.h:71:10: note: ‘__builtin___snprintf_chk’ output between 2 and 4352 bytes into a destination of size 4096

There are other places where we should use path__join(), but lets get rid of
this one first.
