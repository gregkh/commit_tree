device: Add device:: Msi_data pointer and struct msi_device_data

Create struct msi_device_data and add a pointer of that type to struct
dev_msi_info, which is part of struct device. Provide an allocator function
which can be invoked from the MSI interrupt allocation code pathes.

Add a properties field to the data structure as a first member so the
allocation size is not zero bytes. The field will be uses later on.
