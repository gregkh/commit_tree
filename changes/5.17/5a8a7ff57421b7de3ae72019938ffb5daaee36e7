lockd: simplify management of network status notifiers

Now that the network status notifiers use nlmsvc_serv rather then
nlmsvc_rqst the management can be simplified.

Notifier unregistration synchronises with any pending notifications so
providing we unregister before nlm_serv is freed no further interlock
is required.

So we move the unregister call to just before the thread is killed
(which destroys the service) and just before the service is destroyed in
the failure-path of lockd_up().

Then nlm_ntf_refcnt and nlm_ntf_wq can be removed.
