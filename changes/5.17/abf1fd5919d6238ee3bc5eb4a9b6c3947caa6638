xen/blkfront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access() for mapped status

It isn't enough to check whether a grant is still being in use by
calling gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as a mapping could be realized
by the other side just after having called that function.

In case the call was done in preparation of revoking a grant it is
better to do so via gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() and check the
success of that operation instead.

For the ring allocation use alloc_pages_exact() in order to avoid
high order pages in case of a multi-page ring.

If a grant wasn't unmapped by the backend without persistent grants
being used, set the device state to "error".

This is CVE-2022-23036 / part of XSA-396.
