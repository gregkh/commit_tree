drm/i915: Handle CCS CC planes separately from CCS AUX planes

CCS CC planes are quite different from CCS AUX planes, even though we
regard the CC planes as a linear buffer having a 64 byte stride.  Thus
it's clearer to check for either CCS plane types explicitly when we need
to handle them; add the required CCS CC planes check here, while the
next patch will change all is_ccs_plane()/is_gen12_ccs_plane() checks to
consider only the CCS AUX planes.
