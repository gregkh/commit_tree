habanalabs: wrong VA size calculation

VA blocks are currently stored in an inconsistent way. Sometimes block
end is inclusive, sometimes exclusive. This leads to wrong size
calculations in certain cases, plus could lead to a segmentation fault
in case mapping process fails in the middle and we try to roll it back.
Need to make this consistent - start inclusive till end inclusive.

For example, the regions table may now look like this:
    0x0000 - 0x1fff : allocated
    0x2000 - 0x2fff : free
    0x3000 - 0x3fff : allocated
