dt-bindings: pwm: Avoid selecting schema on node name match

Currently any node whose name starts with the "pwm-" prefix will match
this schema and in turn required the "#pwm-cells" property. Avoid this
by marking the schema with select: false, therefore only activating the
schema when directly included from a PWM controller schema file.
