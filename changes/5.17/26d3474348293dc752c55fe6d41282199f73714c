drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Properly undo autosuspend

The PM Runtime docs say:
  Drivers in ->remove() callback should undo the runtime PM changes done
  in ->probe(). Usually this means calling pm_runtime_disable(),
  pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() etc.

We weren't doing that for autosuspend. Let's do it.
