ext4: modify the logic of ext4_mb_new_blocks_simple

For now in ext4_mb_new_blocks_simple, if we found a block which
should be excluded then will switch to next group, this may
probably cause 'group' run out of range.

Change to check next block in the same group when get a block should
be excluded. Also change the search range to EXT4_CLUSTERS_PER_GROUP
and add error checking.
