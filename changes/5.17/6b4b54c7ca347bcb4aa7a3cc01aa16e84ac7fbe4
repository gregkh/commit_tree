s390/setup: preserve memory at OLDMEM_BASE and OLDMEM_SIZE

We need to preserve the values at OLDMEM_BASE and OLDMEM_SIZE which are
used by zgetdump in case when kdump crashes. In that case zgetdump will
attempt to read OLDMEM_BASE and OLDMEM_SIZE in order to find out where
the memory range [0 - OLDMEM_SIZE] belonging to the production kernel is.
