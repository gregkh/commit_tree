ice: support crosstimestamping on E822 devices if supported

E822 devices on supported platforms can generate a cross timestamp
between the platform ART and the device time. This process allows for
very precise measurement of the difference between the PTP hardware
clock and the platform time.

This is only supported if we know the TSC frequency relative to ART, so
we do not enable this unless the boot CPU has a known TSC frequency (as
required by convert_art_ns_to_tsc).

Because PCIe PTM support is not available on all platforms, introduce
CONFIG_ICE_HWTS and make it depend on X86 where we know the support
exists.
