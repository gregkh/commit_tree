KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Fix nested HFSCR being clobbered with multiple vCPUs

The L0 is storing HFSCR requested by the L1 for the L2 in struct
kvm_nested_guest when the L1 requests a vCPU enter L2. kvm_nested_guest
is not a per-vCPU structure. Hilarity ensues.

Fix it by moving the nested hfscr into the vCPU structure together with
the other per-vCPU nested fields.
