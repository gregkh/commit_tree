PCI: mvebu: Fix device enumeration regression

Jan reported that on Turris Omnia (Armada 385), no PCIe devices were
detected after upgrading from v5.16.1 to v5.16.3 and identified the cause
as the backport of 91a8d79fc797 ("PCI: mvebu: Fix configuring secondary bus
of PCIe Root Port via emulated bridge"), which appeared in v5.17-rc1.

91a8d79fc797 was incorrectly applied from mailing list patch [1] to the
linux git repository [2] probably due to resolving merge conflicts
incorrectly. Fix it now.
