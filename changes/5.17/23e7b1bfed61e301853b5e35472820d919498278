xfrm: Don't accidentally set RTO_ONLINK in decode_session4()

Similar to commit 94e2238969e8 ("xfrm4: strip ECN bits from tos field"),
clear the ECN bits from iph->tos when setting ->flowi4_tos.
This ensures that the last bit of ->flowi4_tos is cleared, so
ip_route_output_key_hash() isn't going to restrict the scope of the
route lookup.

Use ~INET_ECN_MASK instead of IPTOS_RT_MASK, because we have no reason
to clear the high order bits.

Found by code inspection, compile tested only.
