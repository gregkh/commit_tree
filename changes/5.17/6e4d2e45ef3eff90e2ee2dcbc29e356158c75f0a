drm/i915/fbc: Pass around FBC instance instead of crtc

Pass the FBC instance instead of the crtc to a bunch of places.

We also adjust intel_fbc_post_update() to do the
intel_fbc_get_reg_params() things instead of doing it from the lower
level function (which also gets called for front buffer tracking).
Nothing in there will change during front buffer updates.
