fs: tweak fsuidgid_has_mapping()

If the caller's fs{g,u}id aren't mapped in the mount's idmapping we can
return early and skip the check whether the mapped fs{g,u}id also have a
mapping in the filesystem's idmapping. If the fs{g,u}id aren't mapped in
the mount's idmapping they consequently can't be mapped in the
filesystem's idmapping. So there's no point in checking that.
