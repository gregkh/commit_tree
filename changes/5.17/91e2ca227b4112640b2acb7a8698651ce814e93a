mmc: dw_mmc-exynos: Add support for ARTPEC-8

The ARTPEC-8 SoC has a DWMMC controller that is compatible with the
Exynos 7 version v2.70a. The main differences from Exynos 7 is that it
does not support HS400 and has extended data read timeout.

This patch adds compatibility string "axis,artpec8-dw-mshc" for
ARTPEC-8, and DW_MCI_TYPE_ARTPEC8 is added to the dw_mci_exynos_type.
