afs: Skip truncation on the server of data we haven't written yet

Don't send a truncation RPC to the server if we're only shortening data
that's in the pagecache and is beyond the server's EOF.

Also don't automatically force writeback on setattr, but do wait to store
RPCs that are in the region to be removed on a shortening truncation.
