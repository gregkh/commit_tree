samples/bpf: xdpsock: Add time-out for cleaning Tx

When user sets tx-pkt-count and in case where there are invalid Tx frame,
the complete_tx_only_all() process polls indefinitely. So, this patch
adds a time-out mechanism into the process so that the application
can terminate automatically after it retries 3*polling interval duration.

v1->v2:
 Thanks to Jesper's and Song Liu's suggestion.
 - clean-up git message to remove polling log
 - make the Tx time-out retries configurable with 1s granularity
