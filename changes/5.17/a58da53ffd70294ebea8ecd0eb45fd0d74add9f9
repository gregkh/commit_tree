vhost/vsock: don't check owner in vhost_vsock_stop() while releasing

vhost_vsock_stop() calls vhost_dev_check_owner() to check the device
ownership. It expects current->mm to be valid.

vhost_vsock_stop() is also called by vhost_vsock_dev_release() when
the user has not done close(), so when we are in do_exit(). In this
case current->mm is invalid and we're releasing the device, so we
should clean it anyway.

Let's check the owner only when vhost_vsock_stop() is called
by an ioctl.

When invoked from release we can not fail so we don't check return
code of vhost_vsock_stop(). We need to stop vsock even if it's not
the owner.
