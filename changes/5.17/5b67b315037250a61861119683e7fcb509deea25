usb-storage: Add unusual-devs entry for VL817 USB-SATA bridge

Two people have reported (and mentioned numerous other reports on the
web) that VIA's VL817 USB-SATA bridge does not work with the uas
driver.  Typical log messages are:

[ 3606.232149] sd 14:0:0:0: [sdg] tag#2 uas_zap_pending 0 uas-tag 1 inflight: CMD
[ 3606.232154] sd 14:0:0:0: [sdg] tag#2 CDB: Write(16) 8a 00 00 00 00 00 18 0c c9 80 00 00 00 80 00 00
[ 3606.306257] usb 4-4.4: reset SuperSpeed Plus Gen 2x1 USB device number 11 using xhci_hcd
[ 3606.328584] scsi host14: uas_eh_device_reset_handler success

Surprisingly, the devices do seem to work okay for some other people.
The cause of the differing behaviors is not known.

In the hope of getting the devices to work for the most users, even at
the possible cost of degraded performance for some, this patch adds an
unusual_devs entry for the VL817 to block it from binding to the uas
driver by default.  Users will be able to override this entry by means
of a module parameter, if they want.
