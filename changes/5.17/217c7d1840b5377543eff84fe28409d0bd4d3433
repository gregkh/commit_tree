dt-bindings: mmc: renesas,sdhi: Rename RZ/G2L clocks

Rename the below RZ/G2L clocks to match with the clock names used in
R-Car Gen2 and later generations.

 imclk->core
 clk_hs->clkh
 imclk2->cd

This changes will avoid using fallback for RZ/G2L high speed clock,
if "clkh" is not used in device tree and also the code changes in
driver related to this clocks.
