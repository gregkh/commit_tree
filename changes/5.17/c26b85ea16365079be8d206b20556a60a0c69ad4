scsi: pm80xx: Fix double completion for SATA devices

Current code handles completions for SATA devices in mpi_sata_completion()
and mpi_sata_event().

However, at the time when any SATA event happens, for almost all the event
types, the command is still in the target. It is therefore incorrect to
complete the task in sata_event().

There are some events for which we get sata_completions, some need recovery
procedure and others abort. All the tasks must be completed via
sata_completion() path.

Removed the task done related code from sata_events().  For tasks where we
don't get completions, let top layer call abort() to abort the command post
timeout.
