powerpc/eeh: Small refactor of eeh_handle_normal_event()

The control flow of eeh_handle_normal_event() is a bit tricky.

Break out one of the error handling paths - rather than be in an else
block, we'll make it part of the regular body of the function and put a
'goto out;' in the true limb of the if.
