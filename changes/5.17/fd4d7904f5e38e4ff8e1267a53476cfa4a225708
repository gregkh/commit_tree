drm/i915: rework some irq functions to take intel_gt as argument

We'll be adding multi-tile support soon; on multi-tile platforms
interrupts are per-tile and every tile has the full set of
interrupt registers.

In this commit we start passing intel_gt instead of dev_priv for the
functions that are related to Xe_HP irq handling. Right now we're still
passing tile 0 everywhere, but in later patches we'll start actually
passing the correct tile.
