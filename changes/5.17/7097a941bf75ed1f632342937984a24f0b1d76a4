btrfs: remove found_extent from btrfs_truncate_inode_items

We only set this if we find a normal file extent, del_item == 1, and the
file extent points to a real extent and isn't a hole extent.  We can use
del_item == 1 && extent_start != 0 to get the same information that
found_extent provides, so remove this variable and use the other
variables instead.
