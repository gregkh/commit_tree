selftest: kvm: Reorder vcpu_load_state steps for AMX

For AMX support it is recommended to load XCR0 after XFD, so
that KVM does not see XFD=0, XCR=1 for a save state that will
eventually be disabled (which would lead to premature allocation
of the space required for that save state).

It is also required to load XSAVE data after XCR0 and XFD, so
that KVM can trigger allocation of the extra space required to
store AMX state.

Adjust vcpu_load_state to obey these new requirements.
