phy: broadcom: Kconfig: Fix PHY_BRCM_USB config option

The previous commit 4b402fa8e0b7 ("phy: phy-brcm-usb: support PHY on
the BCM4908") added a second "default" line for ARCH_BCM_4908 above
the original "default" line for ARCH_BRCMSTB. When two "default"
lines are used, only the first is used and this change stopped
the PHY_BRCM_USB option for being enabled for ARCH_BRCMSTB.
The fix is to use one "default line with "||".
