ASoC: rt5682: Register wclk with its parent_hws instead of parent_data

The mclk might not be registered as a fixed clk name "mclk" on some
platforms.
In those platforms, if the mclk needed to be controlled by codec driver
and acquired by a fixed name, it would be a problem.

This patch to fix the issue that wclk becomes an orphan due to the fixed
mclk's name.
