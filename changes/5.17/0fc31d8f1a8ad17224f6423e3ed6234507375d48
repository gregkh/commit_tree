regulator: Introduce tps68470-regulator driver

The TPS68470 PMIC provides Clocks, GPIOs and Regulators. At present in
the kernel the Regulators and Clocks are controlled by an OpRegion
driver designed to work with power control methods defined in ACPI, but
some platforms lack those methods, meaning drivers need to be able to
consume the resources of these chips through the usual frameworks.

This commit adds a driver for the regulators provided by the tps68470,
and is designed to bind to the platform_device registered by the
intel_skl_int3472 module.

This is based on this out of tree driver written by Intel:
https://github.com/intel/linux-intel-lts/blob/4.14/base/drivers/regulator/tps68470-regulator.c
with various cleanups added.
