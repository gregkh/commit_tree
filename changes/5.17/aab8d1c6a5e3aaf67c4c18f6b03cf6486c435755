net: hns3: delete the hclge_cmd.c and hclgevf_cmd.c

currently most cmdq APIs are unified in hclge_comm_cmd.c. Newly developed
cmdq APIs should also be placed in hclge_comm_cmd.c. So there is no need to
keep hclge_cmd.c and hclgevf_cmd.c.

This patch moves the hclge(vf)_cmd_send to hclge(vf)_main.c and deletes
the source files and makefile scripts.
