RISC-V: KVM: make CY, TM, and IR counters accessible in VU mode

Those applications that run in VU mode and access the time CSR cause
a virtual instruction trap as Guest kernel currently does not
initialize the scounteren CSR.

To fix this, we should make CY, TM, and IR counters accessibile
by default in VU mode (similar to OpenSBI).

destroy functions")
