xdp: xdp_mem_allocator can be NULL in trace_mem_connect().

Since the commit mentioned below __xdp_reg_mem_model() can return a NULL
pointer. This pointer is dereferenced in trace_mem_connect() which leads
to segfault.

The trace points (mem_connect + mem_disconnect) were put in place to
pair connect/disconnect using the IDs. The ID is only assigned if
__xdp_reg_mem_model() does not return NULL. That connect trace point is
of no use if there is no ID.

Skip that connect trace point if xdp_alloc is NULL.

[ Toke Høiland-Jørgensen delivered the reasoning for skipping the trace
  point ]
