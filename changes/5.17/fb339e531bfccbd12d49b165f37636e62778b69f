tracing: Change event_trigger_ops func() to trigger()

The name of the func() callback on event_trigger_ops is too generic
and is easily confused with other callbacks with that name, so change
it to something that reflects its actual purpose.

In this case, the main purpose of the callback is to implement an
event trigger, so call it trigger() instead.

Also add some more documentation to event_trigger_ops describing the
callbacks a bit better.
