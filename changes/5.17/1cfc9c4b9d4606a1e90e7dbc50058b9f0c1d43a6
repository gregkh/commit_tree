KVM: x86/xen: Maintain valid mapping of Xen shared_info page

Use the newly reinstated gfn_to_pfn_cache to maintain a kernel mapping
of the Xen shared_info page so that it can be accessed in atomic context.

Note that we do not participate in dirty tracking for the shared info
page and we do not explicitly mark it dirty every single tim we deliver
an event channel interrupts. We wouldn't want to do that even if we *did*
have a valid vCPU context with which to do so.
