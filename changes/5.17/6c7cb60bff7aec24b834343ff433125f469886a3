ARM: fix Thumb2 regression with Spectre BHB

When building for Thumb2, the vectors make use of a local label. Sadly,
the Spectre BHB code also uses a local label with the same number which
results in the Thumb2 reference pointing at the wrong place. Fix this
by changing the number used for the Spectre BHB local label.
