KVM: SVM: Don't bother checking for "running" AVIC when kicking for IPIs

Drop the avic_vcpu_is_running() check when waking vCPUs in response to a
VM-Exit due to incomplete IPI delivery.  The check isn't wrong per se, but
it's not 100% accurate in the sense that it doesn't guarantee that the vCPU
was one of the vCPUs that didn't receive the IPI.

The check isn't required for correctness as blocking == !running in this
context.

From a performance perspective, waking a live task is not expensive as the
only moderately costly operation is a locked operation to temporarily
disable preemption.  And if that is indeed a performance issue,
kvm_vcpu_is_blocking() would be a better check than poking into the AVIC.
