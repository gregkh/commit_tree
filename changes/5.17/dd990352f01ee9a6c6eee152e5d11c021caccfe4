tracing/osnoise: Make osnoise_main to sleep for microseconds

osnoise's runtime and period are in the microseconds scale, but it is
currently sleeping in the millisecond's scale. This behavior roots in the
usage of hwlat as the skeleton for osnoise.

Make osnoise to sleep in the microseconds scale. Also, move the sleep to
a specialized function.
