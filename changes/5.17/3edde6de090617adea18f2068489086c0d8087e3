ASoC: cs42l42: Simplify reporting of jack unplug

When reporting a jack unplug there's no need to make the reported
flags conditional on which flags were reported during the plug
event. It's perfectly safe to report all flags and buttons as
not-present and let the higher code filter for changes.

There's also no need to make two separate snd_soc_jack_report()
calls for presence flags and button flags. It can all be done in
one report.
