IB/rdmavt: Validate remote_addr during loopback atomic tests

The rdma-core test suite sends an unaligned remote address and expects a
failure.

ERROR: test_atomic_non_aligned_addr (tests.test_atomic.AtomicTest)

The qib/hfi1 rc handling validates properly, but the test has the client
and server on the same system.

The loopback of these operations is a distinct code path.

Fix by syntaxing the proposed remote address in the loopback code path.
