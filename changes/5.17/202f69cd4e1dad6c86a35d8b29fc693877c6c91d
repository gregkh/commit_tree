Revert "arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350: Specify clock-frequency for arch timer"

This reverts commit ed9500c1df59437856d43e657f185fb1eb5d817d.

The clock-frequency property was meant to aid platforms with broken firmwares
that don't set up the timer properly on their own. Don't include it where it is
not the case.
