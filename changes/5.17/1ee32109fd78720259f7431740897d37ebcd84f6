KVM: arm64: Implement __pkvm_host_share_hyp() using do_share()

__pkvm_host_share_hyp() shares memory between the host and the
hypervisor so implement it as an invocation of the new do_share()
mechanism.

Note that double-sharing is no longer permitted (as this allows us to
reduce the number of page-table walks significantly), but is thankfully
no longer relied upon by the host.
