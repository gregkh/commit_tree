mxser: clean up tx handling in mxser_transmit_chars()

The port->icount.tx is handled in a too complicated manner. Instead of
remembering the original count and subtracting the new one from it,
simply increase tx for each character in the loop. No need for cnt
variable then.

Change also the "X = X & Y" assignment to simpler "X &= Y".
