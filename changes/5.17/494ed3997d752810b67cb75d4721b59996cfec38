usb: Introduce Xen pvUSB frontend (xen hcd)

Introduces the Xen pvUSB frontend. With pvUSB it is possible for a Xen
domU to communicate with a USB device assigned to that domU. The
communication is all done via the pvUSB backend in a driver domain
(usually Dom0) which is owner of the physical device.

The pvUSB frontend is a USB hcd for a virtual USB host connector.

The code is taken from the pvUSB implementation in Xen done by Fujitsu
based on Linux kernel 2.6.18.

Changes from the original version are:
- port to upstream kernel
- put all code in just one source file
- move module to appropriate location in kernel tree
- adapt to Linux style guide
- minor code modifications to increase readability
