bpf: Mark PTR_TO_FUNC register initially with zero offset

Similar as with other pointer types where we use ldimm64, clear the register
content to zero first, and then populate the PTR_TO_FUNC type and subprogno
number. Currently this is not done, and leads to reuse of stale register
tracking data.

Given for special ldimm64 cases we always clear the register offset, make it
common for all cases, so it won't be forgotten in future.
