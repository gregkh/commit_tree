ASoC: wm_adsp: Add support for "toggle" preloaders

In the case a device can support retaining the firmware memory across
low power states it is useful for the preloader widget to only power up
whilst actually loading/unloading the core, as opposed to the normal
operation where the widget is powered for the entire time a firmware is
preloaded onto the core. Add support for this mode and a flag to enable
it.
