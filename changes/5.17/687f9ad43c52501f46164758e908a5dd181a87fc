tty: n_gsm: fix wrong modem processing in convergence layer type 2

The function gsm_process_modem() exists to handle modem status bits of
incoming frames. This includes incoming MSC (modem status command) frames
and convergence layer type 2 data frames. The function, however, was only
designed to handle MSC frames as it expects the command length. Within
gsm_dlci_data() it is wrongly assumed that this is the same as the data
frame length. This is only true if the data frame contains only 1 byte of
payload.

This patch names the length parameter of gsm_process_modem() in a generic
manner to reflect its association. It also corrects all calls to the
function to handle the variable number of modem status octets correctly in
both cases.
