bpf: Invert the dependency between bpf-netns.h and netns/bpf.h

netns/bpf.h gets included by netdevice.h (thru net_namespace.h)
which in turn gets included in a lot of places. We should keep
netns/bpf.h as light-weight as possible.

bpf-netns.h seems to contain more implementation details than
deserves to be included in a netns header. It needs to pull in
uapi/bpf.h to get various enum types.

Move enum netns_bpf_attach_type to netns/bpf.h and invert the
dependency. This makes netns/bpf.h fit the mold of a struct
definition header more clearly, and drops the number of objects
rebuilt when uapi/bpf.h is touched from 7.7k to 1.1k.
