block: remove GENHD_FL_CD

GENHD_FL_CD marks a gendisk as a vaguely CD-ROM like device.
Besides being used internally inside of sunvdc.c an xen-blkfront it
is used by xen-blkback as a hint to claim a device exported to a
guest is a CD-ROM like device.  Just check for disk->cdi instead
which is the right indicator for "real" CD-ROM or DVD drivers.  This
will miss the paravirtualized guest drivers, but those make little
sense to report anyway.
