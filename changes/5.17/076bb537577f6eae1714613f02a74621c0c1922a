net: hns3: refactor hclgevf_cmd_send with new hclge_comm_cmd_send API

This patch firstly uses new hardware description struct hclge_comm_hw as
child member of hclgevf_hw and deletes the old hardware description child
members. All the hclgevf_hw variables used in VF module is modified
according to the new hclgevf_hw.

Secondly hclgevf_cmd_send is refactored to use hclge_comm_cmd_send APIs.
The old functions called by hclgevf_cmd_send are all deleted. Still we kept
hclgevf_cmd_send to avoid too many meaningless modifications.
