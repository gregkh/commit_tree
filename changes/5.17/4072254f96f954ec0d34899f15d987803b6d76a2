tty: reformat tty_struct::flags into kernel-doc

Move the partial tty_struct::flags documentation from tty_ldisc to the
tty.h header and combine it with the one-liners present there. Convert
all those to kernel-doc. This way, we can simply reference the
documentation in Documentation while the text is still along the
definitions.
