drm/virtio: fix another potential integer overflow on shift of a int

The left shift of unsigned int 32 bit integer constant 1 is evaluated
using 32 bit arithmetic and then assigned to a signed 64 bit integer.
In the case where value is 32 or more this can lead to an overflow
(value can be in range 0..MAX_CAPSET_ID (63). Fix this by shifting
the value 1ULL instead.
