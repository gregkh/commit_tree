signal: Remove SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP

After the previous cleanups "signal->core_state" is set whenever
SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP is set and "signal->core_state" is tested
whenver the code wants to know if a coredump is in progress.  The
remaining tests of SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP also test to see if
SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT is set.  Similarly the only place that sets
SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP also sets SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT.

Which makes SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP unecessary and redundant. So stop
setting SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP, stop testing SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP, and
remove it's definition.

With the setting of SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP gone, coredump_finish no
longer needs to clear SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP out of signal->flags
by setting SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT.
