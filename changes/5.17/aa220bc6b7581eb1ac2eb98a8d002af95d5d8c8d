watchdog: s3c2410: Add support for WDT counter enable register

On new Exynos chips (e.g. Exynos850) new CLUSTERx_NONCPU_OUT register is
introduced, where CNT_EN_WDT bit must be enabled to make watchdog
counter running. Add corresponding quirk and proper infrastructure to
handle that register if the quirk is set.

This commit doesn't bring any functional change to existing devices, but
merely provides an infrastructure for upcoming chips support.
