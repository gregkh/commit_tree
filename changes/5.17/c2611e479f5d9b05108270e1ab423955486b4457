media: rockchip: rkisp1: use device name for debugfs subdir name

While testing Rockchip RK3399 with both ISPs enabled, a dmesg error
was observed:
```
[   15.559141] debugfs: Directory 'rkisp1' with parent '/' already present!
```

Fix it by using the device name for the debugfs subdirectory name
instead of the driver name, thus preventing name collision.
