net: dsa: lan9303: fix reset on probe

The reset input to the LAN9303 chip is active low, and devicetree
gpio handles reflect this.  Therefore, the gpio should be requested
with an initial state of high in order for the reset signal to be
asserted.  Other uses of the gpio already use the correct polarity.
