gpio: aggregator: Add interrupt support

Currently the GPIO Aggregator does not support interrupts.  This means
that kernel drivers going from a GPIO to an IRQ using gpiod_to_irq(),
and userspace applications using line events do not work.

Add interrupt support by providing a gpio_chip.to_irq() callback, which
just calls into the parent GPIO controller.

Note that this does not implement full interrupt controller (irq_chip)
support, so using e.g. gpio-keys with "interrupts" instead of "gpios"
still does not work.
