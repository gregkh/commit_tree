pinctrl: microchip-sgpio: Fix support for regmap

Initially the driver accessed the registers using u32 __iomem but then
in the blamed commit it changed it to use regmap. The problem is that now
the offset of the registers is not calculated anymore at word offset but
at byte offset. Therefore make sure to multiply the offset with word size.
