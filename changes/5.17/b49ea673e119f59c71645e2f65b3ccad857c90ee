SUNRPC: lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read

->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless ->recv_mutex is held.
So it is important to hold that mutex.  Otherwise a sysfs read can
trigger an oops.
Commit 17f09d3f619a ("SUNRPC: Check if the xprt is connected before
handling sysfs reads") appears to attempt to fix this problem, but it
only narrows the race window.
