media: i2c: Add support for ov5693 sensor

The OV5693 is a 5 Mpx CMOS image sensor, connected via MIPI CSI-2. The
chip is capable of a single lane configuration, but currently only two
lanes are supported.

Most of the sensor's features are supported, with the main exception
being the lens correction algorithm.

The driver provides all mandatory, optional and recommended V4L2 controls
for maximum compatibility with libcamera.
