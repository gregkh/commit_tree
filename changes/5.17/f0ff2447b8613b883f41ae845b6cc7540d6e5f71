selftests/sgx: Add a new kselftest: Unclobbered_vdso_oversubscribed

Add a variation of the unclobbered_vdso test.

In the new test, create a heap for the test enclave, which has the same
size as all available Enclave Page Cache (EPC) pages in the system. This
will guarantee that all test_encl.elf pages *and* SGX Enclave Control
Structure (SECS) have been swapped out by the page reclaimer during the
load time.

This test will trigger both the page reclaimer and the page fault handler.
The page reclaimer triggered, while the heap is being created during the
load time. The page fault handler is triggered for all the required pages,
while the test case is executing.
