powerpc/64s/interrupt: avoid saving CFAR in some asynchronous interrupts

Reading the CFAR register is quite costly (~20 cycles on POWER9). It is
a good idea to have for most synchronous interrupts, but for async ones
it is much less important.

Doorbell, external, and decrementer interrupts are the important
asynchronous ones. HV interrupts can't skip CFAR if KVM HV is possible,
because it might be a guest exit that requires CFAR preserved. But the
important pseries interrupts can avoid loading CFAR.
