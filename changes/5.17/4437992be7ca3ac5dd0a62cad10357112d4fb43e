ext4: remove lazytime/nolazytime mount options handled by MS_LAZYTIME

The lazytime and nolazytime mount options were added temporarily back in
2015 with commit a26f49926da9 ("ext4: add optimization for the lazytime
mount option"). It think it has been enough time for the util-linux with
lazytime support to get widely used. Remove the mount options.
