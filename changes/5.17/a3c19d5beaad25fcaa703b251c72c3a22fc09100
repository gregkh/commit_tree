KVM: SVM: Nullify vcpu_(un)blocking() hooks if AVIC is disabled

Nullify svm_x86_ops.vcpu_(un)blocking if AVIC/APICv is disabled as the
hooks are necessary only to clear the vCPU's IsRunning entry in the
Physical APIC and to update IRTE entries if the VM has a pass-through
device attached.

Opportunistically rename the helpers to clarify their AVIC relationship.
