Documentation: add TTY chapter

We now have all the kernel-doc comments in the code ready. So add a
couple of documents dragging those into generated docs from
Documentation/. There is only some sugar text around included
kernel-docs here.

It's a complete chapter, to be extended later as desired. This is a
solid cornerstone for the time being, I believe.
