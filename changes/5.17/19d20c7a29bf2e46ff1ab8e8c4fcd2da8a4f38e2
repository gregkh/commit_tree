ALSA: usb-audio: revert to IMPLICIT_FB_FIXED_DEV for M-Audio FastTrack Ultra

Commit 83b7dcbc51c930fc2079ab6c6fc9d719768321f1 introduced a generic
implicit feedback parser, which fails to execute for M-Audio FastTrack
Ultra sound cards. The issue is with the ENDPOINT_SYNCTYPE check in
add_generic_implicit_fb() where the SYNCTYPE is ADAPTIVE instead of ASYNC.
The reason is that the sync type of the FastTrack output endpoints are
set to adaptive in the quirks table since commit
65f04443c96dbda11b8fff21d6390e082846aa3c.
