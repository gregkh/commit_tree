ASoC: SOF: OF: Avoid reverse module dependency

Similar with commit 8a49cd11e68ed0 ("ASoC: SOF: ACPI: avoid reverse
module dependency") we will be having hardware specific drivers that
link against a common "helper" framework.

sof-of-dev.c becomes a library with the interface defined in the newly
created file sof-of-dev.h.

This is the final step started with Kconfig simplification in
commit 7548a391c53ca ("ASoC: SOF: i.MX: simplify Kconfig")
