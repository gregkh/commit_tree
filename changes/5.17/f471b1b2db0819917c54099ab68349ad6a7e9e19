This patch fixes the Bluetooth on ROCK Pi 4 boards.

ROCK Pi 4 boards has BCM4345C5 and now it is supported
on Mainline Linux, brcm,bcm43438-bt still working but
observed the BT Audio issues with latest test.

So, use the BCM4345C5 compatible and its associated
properties like clock-names as lpo and max-speed.

Attach vbat and vddio supply rails as well.
