asm-generic: introduce io_stop_wc() and add implementation for ARM64

For memory accesses with write-combining attributes (e.g. those returned
by ioremap_wc()), the CPU may wait for prior accesses to be merged with
subsequent ones. But in some situation, such wait is bad for the
performance.

We introduce io_stop_wc() to prevent the merging of write-combining
memory accesses before this macro with those after it.

We add implementation for ARM64 using DGH instruction and provide NOP
implementation for other architectures.
