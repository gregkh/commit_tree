selftests: KVM: sev_migrate_tests: Fix sev_ioctl()

TEST_ASSERT in SEV ioctl was allowing errors because it checked return
value was good OR the FW error code was OK. This TEST_ASSERT should
require both (aka. AND) values are OK. Removes the LAUNCH_START from the
mirror VM because this call correctly fails because mirror VMs cannot
call this command. Currently issues with the PSP driver functions mean
the firmware error is not always reset to SEV_RET_SUCCESS when a call is
successful. Mainly sev_platform_init() doesn't correctly set the fw
error if the platform has already been initialized.
