e1000: switch to napi_build_skb()

napi_build_skb() reuses per-cpu NAPI skbuff_head cache in order
to save some cycles on freeing/allocating skbuff_heads on every
new Rx or completed Tx element.
e1000 driver runs Tx completion polling cycle right before the Rx
one. Now that e1000 uses napi_consume_skb() to put skbuff_heads of
completed entries into the cache, it will never empty and always
warm at that moment. Switch to the napi_build_skb() to relax mm
pressure on heavy Rx and increase throughput.
