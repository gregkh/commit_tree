RDMA/hns: Support direct wqe of userspace

The current write wqe mechanism is to write to DDR first, and then notify
the hardware through doorbell to read the data. Direct wqe is a mechanism
to fill wqe directly into the hardware. In the case of light load, the wqe
will be filled into pcie bar space of the hardware, this will reduce one
memory access operation and therefore reduce the latency. SIMD
instructions allows cpu to write the 512 bits at one time to device
memory, thus it can be used for posting direct wqe.

Add direct wqe enable switch and address mapping.
