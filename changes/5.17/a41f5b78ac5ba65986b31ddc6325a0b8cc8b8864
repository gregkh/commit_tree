x86/vdso: Remove -nostdlib compiler flag

The -nostdlib option requests the compiler to not use the standard
system startup files or libraries when linking. It is effective only
when $(CC) is used as a linker driver.

Since

  379d98ddf413 ("x86: vdso: Use $LD instead of $CC to link")

$(LD) is directly used, hence -nostdlib is unneeded.
