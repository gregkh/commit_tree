net: hns3: refactor VF tqp stats APIs with new common tqp stats APIs

This patch firstly uses new tqp struct(hclge_comm_tqp) and removes the
old VF tqp struct(hclgevf_tqp). All the tqp stats members used in VF module
are modified according to the new hclge_comm_tqp.

Secondly VF tqp stats APIs are refactored to use new common tqp stats APIs.
The old tqp stats APIs in VF are deleted.
