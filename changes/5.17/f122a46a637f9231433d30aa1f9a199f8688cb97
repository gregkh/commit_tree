drm/i915: enforce min page size for scratch

If the device needs 64K minimum GTT pages for device local-memory,
like on XEHPSDV, then we need to fail the allocation if we can't
meet it, instead of falling back to 4K pages, otherwise we can't
safely support the insertion of device local-memory pages for
this vm, since the HW expects the correct physical alignment and
size for every PTE, if we mark the page-table as 64K GTT mode.
