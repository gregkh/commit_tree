dt-bindings: display: bridge: lvds-codec: Document pixel data sampling edge select

The OnSemi FIN3385 Parallel-to-LVDS encoder has a dedicated input line to
select input pixel data sampling edge. Add DT property "pclk-sample", not
the same as the one used by display timings but rather the same as used by
media, to define the pixel data sampling edge.
