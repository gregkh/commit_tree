drm/i915/display: Fix an unsigned subtraction which can never be negative.

smatch warning:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_dmc.c:601 parse_dmc_fw() warn:
unsigned 'fw->size - offset' is never less than zero

Firmware size is size_t and offset is u32. So the subtraction is
unsigned which can never be less than zero.
