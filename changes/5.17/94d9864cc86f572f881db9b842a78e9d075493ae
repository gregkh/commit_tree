mac80211: treat some SAE auth steps as final

When we get anti-clogging token required (added by the commit
mentioned below), or the other status codes added by the later
commit 4e56cde15f7d ("mac80211: Handle special status codes in
SAE commit") we currently just pretend (towards the internal
state machine of authentication) that we didn't receive anything.

This has the undesirable consequence of retransmitting the prior
frame, which is not expected, because the timer is still armed.

If we just disarm the timer at that point, it would result in
the undesirable side effect of being in this state indefinitely
if userspace crashes, or so.

So to fix this, reset the timer and set a new auth_data->waiting
in order to have no more retransmissions, but to have the data
destroyed when the timer actually fires, which will only happen
if userspace didn't continue (i.e. crashed or abandoned it.)
