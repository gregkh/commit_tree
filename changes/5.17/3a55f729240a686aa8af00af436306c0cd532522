kvm: x86: Disable KVM_HC_CLOCK_PAIRING if tsc is in always catchup mode

If vcpu has tsc_always_catchup set each request updates pvclock data.
KVM_HC_CLOCK_PAIRING consumers such as ptp_kvm_x86 rely on tsc read on
host's side and do hypercall inside pvclock_read_retry loop leading to
infinite loop in such situation.

v3:
    Removed warn
    Changed return code to KVM_EFAULT
v2:
    Added warn
