bpf: Support BTF_KIND_TYPE_TAG for btf_type_tag attributes

LLVM patches ([1] for clang, [2] and [3] for BPF backend)
added support for btf_type_tag attributes. This patch
added support for the kernel.

The main motivation for btf_type_tag is to bring kernel
annotations __user, __rcu etc. to btf. With such information
available in btf, bpf verifier can detect mis-usages
and reject the program. For example, for __user tagged pointer,
developers can then use proper helper like bpf_probe_read_user()
etc. to read the data.

BTF_KIND_TYPE_TAG may also useful for other tracing
facility where instead of to require user to specify
kernel/user address type, the kernel can detect it
by itself with btf.
