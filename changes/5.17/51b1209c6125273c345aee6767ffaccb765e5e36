KVM: Clear pv eoi pending bit only when it is set

merge pv_eoi_get_pending and pv_eoi_clr_pending into a single
function pv_eoi_test_and_clear_pending, which returns and clear
the value of the pending bit.

This makes it possible to clear the pending bit only if the guest
had set it, and otherwise skip the call to pv_eoi_put_user().
This can save up to 300 nsec on AMD EPYC processors.
