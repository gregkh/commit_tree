powerpc/book3e: Activate KUEP at all time

On book3e,
- When using 64 bits PTE: User pages don't have the SX bit defined
so KUEP is always active.
- When using 32 bits PTE: Implement KUEP by clearing SX bit during
TLB miss for user pages. The impact is minimal and worth neither
boot time nor build time selection.

Activate it at all time.
