scsi: pm80xx: Port reset timeout error handling correction

Error handling steps were not in sequence as per the programmers
manual. Expected sequence:

 - PHY_DOWN (PORT_IN_RESET)

 - PORT_RESET_TIMER_TMO

 - Host aborts pending I/Os

 - Host deregister the device

 - Host sends HW_EVENT_PHY_DOWN ACK

Previously we were sending HW_EVENT_PHY_DOWN ACK first and then deregister
the device. Fix this to use the expected sequence.
