unicode: clean up the Kconfig symbol confusion

Turn the CONFIG_UNICODE symbol into a tristate that generates some always
built in code and remove the confusing CONFIG_UNICODE_UTF8_DATA symbol.

Note that a lot of the IS_ENABLED() checks could be turned from cpp
statements into normal ifs, but this change is intended to be fairly
mechanic, so that should be cleaned up later.
