dmaengine: pxa/mmp: stop referencing config->slave_id

The last driver referencing the slave_id on Marvell PXA and MMP platforms
was the SPI driver, but this stopped doing so a long time ago, so the
TODO from the earlier patch can no be removed.

Fixes: b729bf34535e ("spi/pxa2xx: Don't use slave_id of dma_slave_config")
Fixes: 13b3006b8ebd ("dma: mmp_pdma: add filter function")
