drm/amdkfd: Fix error handling in svm_range_add

Add null-pointer check after the last svm_range_new call. This was
originally reported by Zhou Qingyang <zhou1615@umn.edu> based on a
static analyzer.

To avoid duplicating the unwinding code from svm_range_handle_overlap,
I merged the two functions into one.
