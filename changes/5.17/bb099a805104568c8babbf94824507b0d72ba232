habanalabs: fix hwmon handling for legacy f/w

In legacy f/w that use old hwmon.h file, the values of the hwmon
enums are different than the values that are in newer kernels (5.6
and above).

Therefore, to support working with those f/w, we need to do some
fixup before registering with the hwmon subsystem and also when
calling the functions that communicate with the f/w to retrieve
sensors information.
