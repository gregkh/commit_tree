serial: 8250_pci: remove redundant assignment to tmp after the mask operation

The variable tmp is being masked with a bitmask and the value is being
written to port base + 0x3c.  However, the masked value is being written
back to tmp and tmp is never used after this. The assignmentment is
redundant, replace the &= operator with just &.
