staging: vchiq_core: remove superfluous static_assert statement

After removing the BITSET_T typedef in commit d8a364820e01 ("staging:
vchiq_core: get rid of typedef") the static_assert statement becomes superfluous
as now we are checking if the size of the u32 type is 4 bytes. Hence, just
remove the static_assert statement.
