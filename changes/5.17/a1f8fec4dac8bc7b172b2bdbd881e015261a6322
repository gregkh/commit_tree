tipc: Fix end of loop tests for list_for_each_entry()

These tests are supposed to check if the loop exited via a break or not.
However the tests are wrong because if we did not exit via a break then
"p" is not a valid pointer.  In that case, it's the equivalent of
"if (*(u32 *)sr == *last_key) {".  That's going to work most of the time,
but there is a potential for those to be equal.
