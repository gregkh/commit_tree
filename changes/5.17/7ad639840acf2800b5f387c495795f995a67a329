thread_info: Add helpers to snapshot thread flags

In <linux/thread_info.h> there are helpers to manipulate individual thread
flags, but where code wants to check several flags at once, it must open
code reading current_thread_info()->flags and operating on a snapshot.

As some flags can be set remotely it's necessary to use READ_ONCE() to get
a consistent snapshot even when IRQs are disabled, but some code forgets to
do this. Generally this is unlike to cause a problem in practice, but it is
somewhat unsound, and KCSAN will legitimately warn that there is a data
race.

To make it easier to do the right thing, and to highlight that concurrent
modification is possible, add new helpers to snapshot the flags, which
should be used in preference to plain reads. Subsequent patches will move
existing code to use the new helpers.
