net: bcmgenet: skip invalid partial checksums

The RXCHK block will return a partial checksum of 0 if it encounters
a problem while receiving a packet. Since a 1's complement sum can
only produce this result if no bits are set in the received data
stream it is fair to treat it as an invalid partial checksum and
not pass it up the stack.
