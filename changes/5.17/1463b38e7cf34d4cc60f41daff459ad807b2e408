NFSD: simplify per-net file cache management

We currently have a 'laundrette' for closing cached files - a different
work-item for each network-namespace.

These 'laundrettes' (aka struct nfsd_fcache_disposal) are currently on a
list, and are freed using rcu.

The list is not necessary as we have a per-namespace structure (struct
nfsd_net) which can hold a link to the nfsd_fcache_disposal.
The use of kfree_rcu is also unnecessary as the cache is cleaned of all
files associated with a given namespace, and no new files can be added,
before the nfsd_fcache_disposal is freed.

So add a '->fcache_disposal' link to nfsd_net, and discard the list
management and rcu usage.
