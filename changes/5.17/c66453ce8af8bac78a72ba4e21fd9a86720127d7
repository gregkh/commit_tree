tty: fix kernel-doc in n_tty.c

* process_echoes doc was a misnomer
* isig and n_tty_receive_char docs were misplaced
* n_tty_read parameters were incorrect (from pre-cookie times)

So fix all the warnings at once:
624: warning: expecting prototype for process_echoes(). Prototype was for __process_echoes() instead
1110: warning: expecting prototype for isig(). Prototype was for __isig() instead
1264: warning: expecting prototype for n_tty_receive_char(). Prototype was for n_tty_receive_char_special() instead
2067: warning: Excess function parameter 'buf' description in 'n_tty_read'
624: warning: expecting prototype for process_echoes(). Prototype was for __process_echoes() instead
