KVM: x86: Update vPMCs when retiring instructions

When KVM retires a guest instruction through emulation, increment any
vPMCs that are configured to monitor "instructions retired," and
update the sample period of those counters so that they will overflow
at the right time.

[jmattson:
  - Split the code to increment "branch instructions retired" into a
    separate commit.
  - Added 'static' to kvm_pmu_incr_counter() definition.
  - Modified kvm_pmu_incr_counter() to check pmc->perf_event->state ==
    PERF_EVENT_STATE_ACTIVE.

[likexu:
  - Drop checks for pmc->perf_event or event state or event type
  - Increase a counter once its umask bits and the first 8 select bits are matched
  - Rewrite kvm_pmu_incr_counter() with a less invasive approach to the host perf;
  - Rename kvm_pmu_record_event to kvm_pmu_trigger_event;
  - Add counter enable and CPL check for kvm_pmu_trigger_event();
