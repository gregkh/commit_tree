drm/amd/display: Initialise encoder assignment when initialising dc_state

[Why]
Link encoder assignment tracking variables need to be (re)initialised
whenever dc_state is (re)initialised. Otherwise variables used for
dynamic encoder assignment (especially the link encoder availability
pool) are out of sync with dc_state and future encoder assignments are
invalid.

[How]
Initialise encoder assignment variables when creating new dc_state
resource.
