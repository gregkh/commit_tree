drm/amd/display: Reset DMCUB before HW init

[Why]
If the firmware wasn't reset by PSP or HW and is currently running
then the firmware will hang or perform underfined behavior when we
modify its firmware state underneath it.

[How]
Reset DMCUB before setting up cache windows and performing HW init.
