ext4: make sure quota gets properly shutdown on error

When we hit an error when enabling quotas and setting inode flags, we do
not properly shutdown quota subsystem despite returning error from
Q_QUOTAON quotactl. This can lead to some odd situations like kernel
using quota file while it is still writeable for userspace. Make sure we
properly cleanup the quota subsystem in case of error.
