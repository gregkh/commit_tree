clk: qcom: gcc-msm8994: Remove NoC clocks

Just like in commit 05cf3ec00d46 ("clk: qcom: gcc-msm8996: Drop (again)
gcc_aggre1_pnoc_ahb_clk") adding NoC clocks turned out to be a huge
mistake, as they cause a lot of issues at little benefit (basically
letting Linux know about their children's frequencies), especially when
mishandled or misconfigured.

Adding these ones broke SDCC approx 99 out of 100 times, but that somehow
went unnoticed. To prevent further issues like this one, remove them.

This commit is effectively a revert of 74a33fac3aab ("clk: qcom:
gcc-msm8994: Add missing NoC clocks") with ABI preservation.
