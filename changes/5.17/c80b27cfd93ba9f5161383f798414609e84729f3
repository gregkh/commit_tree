scsi: lpfc: Remove NVMe support if kernel has NVME_FC disabled

The driver is initiating NVMe PRLIs to determine device NVMe support.  This
should not be occurring if CONFIG_NVME_FC support is disabled.

Correct this by changing the default value for FC4 support. Currently it
defaults to FCP and NVMe. With change, when NVME_FC support is not enabled
in the kernel, the default value is just FCP.
