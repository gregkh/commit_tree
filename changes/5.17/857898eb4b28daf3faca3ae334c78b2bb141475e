selftests: mptcp: add missing join check

This function also writes the name of the test with its ID, making clear
a new test has been executed.

Without that, the ADD_ADDR results from this test was appended at the
end of the previous test causing confusions. Especially when the second
test was failing, we had:

  17 signal invalid addresses     syn[ ok ] - synack[ ok ] - ack[ ok ]
                                  add[ ok ] - echo  [ ok ]
                                  add[fail] got 2 ADD_ADDR[s] expected 3

In fact, this 17th test was OK but not the 18th one.

Now we have:

  17 signal invalid addresses     syn[ ok ] - synack[ ok ] - ack[ ok ]
                                  add[ ok ] - echo  [ ok ]
  18 signal addresses race test   syn[fail] got 2 JOIN[s] syn expected 3
   - synack[fail] got 2 JOIN[s] synack expected
   - ack[fail] got 2 JOIN[s] ack expected 3
                                  add[fail] got 2 ADD_ADDR[s] expected 3
