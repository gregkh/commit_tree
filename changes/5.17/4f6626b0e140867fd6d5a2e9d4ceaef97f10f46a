Revert "net/mlx5: Add retry mechanism to the command entry index allocation"

This reverts commit 410bd754cd73c4a2ac3856d9a03d7b08f9c906bf.

The reverted commit had added a retry mechanism to the command entry
index allocation. The previous patch ensures that there is a free
command entry index once the command work handler holds the command
semaphore. Thus the retry mechanism is not needed.
