Revert "net/mlx5e: Block offload of outer header csum for UDP tunnels"

This reverts commit 6d6727dddc7f93fcc155cb8d0c49c29ae0e71122.

Although the NIC doesn't support offload of outer header CSUM, using
gso_partial_features allows offloading the tunnel's segmentation. The
driver relies on the stack CSUM calculation of the outer header. For
this, NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM must be a member of the device's
features.
