eeprom: at25: Restore missing allocation

The at25 driver regressed in v5.17-rc1 due to a broken conflict
resolution: the allocation of the object was accidentally removed. Restore
it.

This was found when building under CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y and
-Warray-bounds, which complained about strncpy() being used against an
empty object:
