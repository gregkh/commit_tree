riscv: canaan: remove useless select of non-existing config SYSCON

The config SYSCON never existed in the kernel repository; so, the select of
that config in ./drivers/soc/canaan/Kconfig has no effect.

Presumably, this was just some mistake, assuming some symmetry in handling
and naming of configs that simply does not exist.

Remove this useless select of a non-existing config.
