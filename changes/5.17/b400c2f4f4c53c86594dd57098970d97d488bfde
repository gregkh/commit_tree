net: axienet: Wait for PhyRstCmplt after core reset

When resetting the device, wait for the PhyRstCmplt bit to be set
in the interrupt status register before continuing initialization, to
ensure that the core is actually ready. When using an external PHY, this
also ensures we do not start trying to access the PHY while it is still
in reset. The PHY reset is initiated by the core reset which is
triggered just above, but remains asserted for 5ms after the core is
reset according to the documentation.

The MgtRdy bit could also be waited for, but unfortunately when using
7-series devices, the bit does not appear to work as documented (it
seems to behave as some sort of link state indication and not just an
indication the transceiver is ready) so it can't really be relied on for
this purpose.
