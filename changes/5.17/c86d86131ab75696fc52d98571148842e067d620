Partially revert "net/smc: Add netlink net namespace support"

The change of sizeof(struct smc_diag_linkinfo) by commit 79d39fc503b4
("net/smc: Add netlink net namespace support") introduced an ABI
regression: since struct smc_diag_lgrinfo contains an object of
type "struct smc_diag_linkinfo", offset of all subsequent members
of struct smc_diag_lgrinfo was changed by that change.

As result, applications compiled with the old version
of struct smc_diag_linkinfo will receive garbage in
struct smc_diag_lgrinfo.role if the kernel implements
this new version of struct smc_diag_linkinfo.

Fix this regression by reverting the part of commit 79d39fc503b4 that
changes struct smc_diag_linkinfo.  After all, there is SMC_GEN_NETLINK
interface which is good enough, so there is probably no need to touch
the smc_diag ABI in the first place.
