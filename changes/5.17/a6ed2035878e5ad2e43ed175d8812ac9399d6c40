drm/amd: Warn users about potential s0ix problems

On some OEM setups users can configure the BIOS for S3 or S2idle.
When configured to S3 users can still choose 's2idle' in the kernel by
using `/sys/power/mem_sleep`.  Before commit 6dc8265f9803 ("drm/amdgpu:
always reset the asic in suspend (v2)"), the GPU would crash.  Now when
configured this way, the system should resume but will use more power.

As such, adjust the `amdpu_acpi_is_s0ix function` to warn users about
potential power consumption issues during their first attempt at
suspending.
