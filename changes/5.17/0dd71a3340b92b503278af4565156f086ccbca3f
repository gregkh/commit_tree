ASoC: SOF: pcm: invoke platform hw_free for STOP/SUSPEND triggers

snd_sof_pcm_platform_hw_params() will be called when the stream is
restarted with a prepare ioctl. This happens in two cases i.e. when a
suspended stream is resumed or when a stream is restarted without
intermediate call to sof_pcm_hw_free(). Make sure to call
snd_sof_pcm_platform_hw_free() in both these cases to keep it balanced.
