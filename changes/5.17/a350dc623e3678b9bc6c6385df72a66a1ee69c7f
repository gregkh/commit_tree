ARM: dts: aspeed: add LCLK setting into LPC IBT node

If LPC BT driver is registered ahead of lpc-ctrl module, LPC BT
hardware block will be enabled without heart beating of LCLK until
lpc-ctrl enables the LCLK. This issue causes improper handling on
host interrupts when the host sends interrupts in that time frame.
Then kernel eventually forcibly disables the interrupt with
dumping stack and printing a 'nobody cared this irq' message out.

To prevent this issue, all LPC sub drivers should enable LCLK
individually so this patch adds 'clocks' property setting into LPC
IBT node as one of required properties to enable the LCLK by the
LPC IBT driver.

Note: dtbs should be re-compiled after applying this change since
it's adding a new required property otherwise the driver will not
be probed correctly.
