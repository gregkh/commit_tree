lockdep: Remove softirq accounting on PREEMPT_RT.

There is not really a softirq context on PREEMPT_RT.  Softirqs on
PREEMPT_RT are always invoked within the context of a threaded
interrupt handler or within ksoftirqd. The "in-softirq" context is
preemptible and is protected by a per-CPU lock to ensure mutual
exclusion.

There is no difference on PREEMPT_RT between spin_lock_irq() and
spin_lock() because the former does not disable interrupts. Therefore
if a lock is used in_softirq() and locked once with spin_lock_irq()
then lockdep will report this with "inconsistent {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} ->
{IN-SOFTIRQ-W} usage".

Teach lockdep that we don't really do softirqs on -RT.
