I looked at cred->ucount and it is only used for rlimit operations
that were previously stored in cred->user.  Making the fact
cred->ucount can refer to a different user from cred->user a bug,
affecting all uses of cred->ulimit not just RLIMIT_NPROC.

Fix set_cred_ucounts to always use the real uid not the effective uid.

Further simplify set_cred_ucounts by noticing that set_cred_ucounts
somehow retained a draft version of the check to see if alloc_ucounts
was needed that checks the new->user and new->user_ns against the
current_real_cred().  Remove that draft version of the check.

All that matters for setting the cred->ucounts are the user_ns and uid
fields in the cred.
