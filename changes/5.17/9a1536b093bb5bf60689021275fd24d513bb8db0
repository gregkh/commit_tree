lib/crypto: sha1: re-roll loops to reduce code size

With SHA-1 no longer being used for anything performance oriented, and
also soon to be phased out entirely, we can make up for the space added
by unrolled BLAKE2s by simply re-rolling SHA-1. Since SHA-1 is so much
more complex, re-rolling it more or less takes care of the code size
added by BLAKE2s. And eventually, hopefully we'll see SHA-1 removed
entirely from most small kernel builds.
