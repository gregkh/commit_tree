drm/radeon/radeon_kms: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in radeon_driver_open_kms()

In radeon_driver_open_kms(), radeon_vm_bo_add() is assigned to
vm->ib_bo_va and passes and used in radeon_vm_bo_set_addr(). In
radeon_vm_bo_set_addr(), there is a dereference of vm->ib_bo_va,
which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of
radeon_vm_bo_add().

Fix this bug by adding a check of vm->ib_bo_va.

This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
the callers, so they constitute bugs.

Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
the bug.

Builds with CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m show no new warnings,
and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.
