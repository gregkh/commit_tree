net: dsa: sja1105: make dp->priv point directly to sja1105_tagger_data

The design of the sja1105 tagger dp->priv is that each port has a
separate struct sja1105_port, and the sp->data pointer points to a
common struct sja1105_tagger_data.

We have removed all per-port members accessible by the tagger, and now
only struct sja1105_tagger_data remains. Make dp->priv point directly to
this.
