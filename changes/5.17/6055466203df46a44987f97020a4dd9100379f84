drm/ingenic: Upload palette before frame

When using C8 color mode, make sure that the palette is always uploaded
before a frame; otherwise the very first frame will have wrong colors.

Do that by changing the link order of the DMA descriptors.

v3: Fix ingenic_drm_get_new_priv_state() called instead of
    ingenic_drm_get_priv_state()
