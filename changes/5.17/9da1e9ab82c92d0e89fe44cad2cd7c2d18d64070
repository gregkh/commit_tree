drm/rockchip: vop: Correct RK3399 VOP register fields

Commit 7707f7227f09 ("drm/rockchip: Add support for afbc") switched up
the rk3399_vop_big[] register windows, but it did so incorrectly.

The biggest problem is in rk3288_win23_data[] vs.
rk3368_win23_data[] .format field:

  RK3288's format: VOP_REG(RK3288_WIN2_CTRL0, 0x7, 1)
  RK3368's format: VOP_REG(RK3368_WIN2_CTRL0, 0x3, 5)

Bits 5:6 (i.e., shift 5, mask 0x3) are correct for RK3399, according to
the TRM.

There are a few other small differences between the 3288 and 3368
definitions that were swapped in commit 7707f7227f09. I reviewed them to
the best of my ability according to the RK3399 TRM and fixed them up.

This fixes IOMMU issues (and display errors) when testing with BG24
color formats.
