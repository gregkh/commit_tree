KVM: s390: Skip gfn/size sanity checks on memslot DELETE or FLAGS_ONLY

Sanity check the hva, gfn, and size of a userspace memory region only if
any of those properties can change, i.e. skip the checks for DELETE and
FLAGS_ONLY.  KVM doesn't allow moving the hva or changing the size, a gfn
change shows up as a MOVE even if flags are being modified, and the
checks are pointless for the DELETE case as userspace_addr and gfn_base
are zeroed by common KVM.

No functional change intended.
