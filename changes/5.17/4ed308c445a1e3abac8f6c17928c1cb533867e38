ftrace: Have architectures opt-in for mcount build time sorting

First S390 complained that the sorting of the mcount sections at build
time caused the kernel to crash on their architecture. Now PowerPC is
complaining about it too. And also ARM64 appears to be having issues.

It may be necessary to also update the relocation table for the values
in the mcount table. Not only do we have to sort the table, but also
update the relocations that may be applied to the items in the table.

If the system is not relocatable, then it is fine to sort, but if it is,
some architectures may have issues (although x86 does not as it shifts all
addresses the same).

Add a HAVE_BUILDTIME_MCOUNT_SORT that an architecture can set to say it is
safe to do the sorting at build time.

Also update the config to compile in build time sorting in the sorttable
code in scripts/ to depend on CONFIG_BUILDTIME_MCOUNT_SORT.
