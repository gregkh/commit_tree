sysctl: add and use base directory declarer and registration helper

Patch series "sysctl: add and use base directory declarer and
registration helper".

In this patch series we start addressing base directories, and so we
start with the "fs" sysctls.  The end goal is we end up completely
moving all "fs" sysctl knobs out from kernel/sysctl.

This patch (of 6):

Add a set of helpers which can be used to declare and register base
directory sysctls on their own.  We do this so we can later move each of
the base sysctl directories like "fs", "kernel", etc, to their own
respective files instead of shoving the declarations and registrations
all on kernel/sysctl.c.  The lazy approach has caught up and with this,
we just end up extending the list of base directories / sysctls on one
file and this makes maintenance difficult due to merge conflicts from
many developers.

The declarations are used first by kernel/sysctl.c for registration its
own base which over time we'll try to clean up.  It will be used in the
next patch to demonstrate how to cleanly deal with base sysctl
directories.
