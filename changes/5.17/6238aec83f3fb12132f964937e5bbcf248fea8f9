NFS: don't store 'struct cred *' in struct nfs_access_entry

Storing the 'struct cred *' in nfs_access_entry is problematic.
An active 'cred' can keep a 'struct key *' active, and a quota is
imposed on the number of such keys that a user can maintain.
Cached 'nfs_access_entry' structs have indefinite lifetime, and having
these keep 'struct key's alive imposes on that quota.

So remove the 'struct cred *' and replace it with the fields we need:
  kuid_t, kgid_t, and struct group_info *

This makes the 'struct nfs_access_entry' 64 bits larger.

New function "access_cmp" is introduced which is identical to
cred_fscmp() except that the second arg is an 'nfs_access_entry', rather
than a 'cred'
