btrfs: scrub: remove the unnecessary path parameter for scrub_raid56_parity()

In function scrub_stripe() we allocated two btrfs_path's, one @path for
extent tree search and another @ppath for full stripe extent tree search
for RAID56.

This is totally umncessary, as the @ppath usage is completely inside
scrub_raid56_parity(), thus we can move the path allocation into
scrub_raid56_parity() completely.
