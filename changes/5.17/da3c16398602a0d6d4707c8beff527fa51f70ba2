net: marvell: prestera: Register inetaddr stub notifiers

Initial implementation of notification handlers. For now this is just
stub.
So that we can move forward and add prestera_router_hw's objects
manipulations.

We support several addresses on interface. We just have nothing to do for
second address, because rif is already enabled on this interface, after
first one.
