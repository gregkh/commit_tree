PCI/MSI: Unbreak pci_irq_get_affinity()

The recent cleanup of pci_irq_get_affinity() broke the function for
PCI/MSI-X and indices > 0. Only the MSI descriptor for PCI/MSI has more
than one affinity mask which can be retrieved via the MSI index.

PCI/MSI-X has one descriptor per vector and each has a single affinity
mask.

Use index 0 when accessing the affinity mask in the MSI descriptor when
MSI-X is enabled.
