power: supply: ab8500: Make recharge capacity a constant

The recharge capacity is the hysteresis level for a charger to
restart when a battery does not support maintenance charging.

All products using the AB8500 have batteries supporting
maintenace charging and all code has always set this to 95%.

Turn it into a constant.
