ALSA: hda: Remove redundant runtime PM calls

The previous fix for more comprehensive runtime PM calls turned out to
be not good as hoped; a few calls including pm_runtime_enable() and
pm_runtime_disable() are rather utterly superfluous for PCI devices,
even triggering a kernel error message.  Better to drop those calls.

Note that the problem we wanted to solve with that commit seems
irrelevant with the fix itself; the original bug (a GPF at
azx_remove()) was likely a regression by the recent PCI core cleanup,
and the buggy PCI change has been already reverted.  So basically we
were scratching a wrong surface.  OTOH, making the runtime PM calls
symmetric for both probe and remove is more consistent, and maybe
that's a sensible outcome.
