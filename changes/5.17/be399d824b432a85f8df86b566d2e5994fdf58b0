KVM: arm64: Hide kvm_arm_pmu_available behind CONFIG_HW_PERF_EVENTS=y

Move the definition of kvm_arm_pmu_available to pmu-emul.c and, out of
"necessity", hide it behind CONFIG_HW_PERF_EVENTS.  Provide a stub for
the key's wrapper, kvm_arm_support_pmu_v3().  Moving the key's definition
out of perf.c will allow a future commit to delete perf.c entirely.
