drm/amdgpu: Unmap MMIO mappings when device is not unplugged

Patch: 3efb17ae7e92 ("drm/amdgpu: Call amdgpu_device_unmap_mmio() if device
is unplugged to prevent crash in GPU initialization failure") makes call to
amdgpu_device_unmap_mmio() conditioned on device unplugged. This patch unmaps
MMIO mappings even when device is not unplugged.

v2: Add condition of drm_dev_enter() to deleted unmaps in patch
"drm/amdgpu: Unmap all MMIO mappings"
