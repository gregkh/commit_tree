IB/iser: Don't suppress send completions

In order to complete a scsi command and guarantee that the HCA will never
perform an access violation when retrying a send operation we must
complete a scsi request only when both send and receive completions has
arrived. This is a preparation commit that remove the send completions
suppression. Next step will be taking care of the local invalidation
mechanism and adding a reference counter for commands.  Currently, we
don't do anything upon getting the send completion and just "consume" it.
