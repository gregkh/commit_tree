NFSD: Fix the behavior of READ near OFFSET_MAX

Dan Aloni reports:

The Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all
NFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a
READ.

Instead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed
and return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent
the client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to
be consistent with Solaris NFS servers.

Note that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These
must be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit
type cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks
against sb->s_maxbytes do not work properly.
