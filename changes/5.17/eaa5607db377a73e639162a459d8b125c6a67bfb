net: hns3: refactor hclge_cmd_send with new hclge_comm_cmd_send API

This patch firstly uses new hardware description struct hclge_comm_hw as
child member of hclge_hw and deletes the original child memebers of
hclge_hw. All the hclge_hw variables used in PF module is modified
according to the new hclge_hw.

Secondly hclge_cmd_send is refactored to use hclge_comm_cmd_send APIs. The
old functions called by hclge_cmd_send are deleted and hclge_cmd_send is
kept to avoid too many meaningless modifications.
