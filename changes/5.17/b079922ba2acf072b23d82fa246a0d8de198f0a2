net: dsa: add a "tx_fwd_offload" argument to ->port_bridge_join

This is a preparation patch for the removal of the DSA switch methods
->port_bridge_tx_fwd_offload() and ->port_bridge_tx_fwd_unoffload().
The plan is for the switch to report whether it offloads TX forwarding
directly as a response to the ->port_bridge_join() method.

This change deals with the noisy portion of converting all existing
function prototypes to take this new boolean pointer argument.
The bool is placed in the cross-chip notifier structure for bridge join,
and a reference to it is provided to drivers. In the next change, DSA
will then actually look at this value instead of calling
->port_bridge_tx_fwd_offload().
