NFS: pass cred explicitly for access tests

Storing the 'struct cred *' in nfs_access_entry is problematic.
An active 'cred' can keep a 'struct key *' active, and a quota is
imposed on the number of such keys that a user can maintain.
Cached 'nfs_access_entry' structs have indefinite lifetime, and having
these keep 'struct key's alive imposes on that quota.

So a future patch will remove the ->cred ref from nfs_access_entry.

To prepare, change various functions to not assume there is a 'cred' in
the nfs_access_entry, but to pass the cred around explicitly.
