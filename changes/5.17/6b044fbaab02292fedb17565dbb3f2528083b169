lockd: use svc_set_num_threads() for thread start and stop

svc_set_num_threads() does everything that lockd_start_svc() does, except
set sv_maxconn.  It also (when passed 0) finds the threads and
stops them with kthread_stop().

So move the setting for sv_maxconn, and use svc_set_num_thread()

We now don't need nlmsvc_task.

Now that we use svc_set_num_threads() it makes sense to set svo_module.
This request that the thread exists with module_put_and_exit().
Also fix the documentation for svo_module to make this explicit.

svc_prepare_thread is now only used where it is defined, so it can be
made static.
