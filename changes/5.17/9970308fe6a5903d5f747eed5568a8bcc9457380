net: hns3: refactor hclge_comm_send function in PF/VF drivers

Currently, there are two different sets of special command codes in PF and
VF cmdq modules, this is because VF driver only uses small part of all the
command codes. In other words, these not used command codes in VF are also
sepcial command codes theoretically.

So this patch unifes the special command codes and deletes the bool param
is_pf of hclge_comm_send. All the related functions are refactored
according to the new hclge_comm_send function prototype.
