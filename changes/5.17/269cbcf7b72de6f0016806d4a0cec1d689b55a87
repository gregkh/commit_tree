usb: dwc2: drd: fix soft connect when gadget is unconfigured

When the gadget driver hasn't been (yet) configured, and the cable is
connected to a HOST, the SFTDISCON gets cleared unconditionally, so the
HOST tries to enumerate it.
At the host side, this can result in a stuck USB port or worse. When
getting lucky, some dmesg can be observed at the host side:
 new high-speed USB device number ...
 device descriptor read/64, error -110

Fix it in drd, by checking the enabled flag before calling
dwc2_hsotg_core_connect(). It will be called later, once configured,
by the normal flow:
- udc_bind_to_driver
 - usb_gadget_connect
   - dwc2_hsotg_pullup
     - dwc2_hsotg_core_connect
