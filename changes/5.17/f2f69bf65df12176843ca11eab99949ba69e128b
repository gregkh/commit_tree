usb: gadget: u_audio: fix calculations for small bInterval

If bInterval is 1, then p_interval is 8000 and p_interval_mil is 8E9,
which is too big for a 32-bit value.  While the storage is indeed
64-bit, this value is used as the divisor in do_div() which will
truncate it into a uint32_t leading to incorrect calculated values.

Switch back to keeping the base value in struct snd_uac_chip which fits
easily into an int, meaning that the division can be done in two steps
with the divisor fitting safely into a uint32_t on both steps.
