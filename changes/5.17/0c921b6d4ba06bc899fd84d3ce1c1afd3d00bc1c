drm/tegra: dc: rgb: Allow changing PLLD rate on Tegra30+

Asus Transformer TF700T is a Tegra30 tablet device which uses RGB->DSI
bridge that requires a precise clock rate in order to operate properly.
Tegra30 has a dedicated PLL for each display controller, hence the PLL
rate can be changed freely. Allow PLL rate changes on Tegra30+ for RGB
output. Configure the clock rate before display controller is enabled
since DC itself may be running off this PLL and it's not okay to change
the rate of the active PLL that doesn't support dynamic frequency
switching since hardware will hang.
