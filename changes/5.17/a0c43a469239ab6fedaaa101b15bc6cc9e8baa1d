staging: pi433: add docs to packet_format and tx_start_condition enum

While pi433 driver deals with the nuances of the different possible
config combinations, it's hard (at first) to understand the rationale
for some of the tx/rx-related source code unless you're fairly familiar
with the rf69's inner workings.

This patch documents the expected behaviour and limits of both
packet_format and tx_start_condition enum fields.
