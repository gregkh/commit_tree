Documentation/auxiliary_bus: Clarify auxiliary_device creation

The documentation for creating an auxiliary device is a 3 step not a 2
step process.  Specifically the requirements of setting the name, id,
dev.release, and dev.parent fields was not clear as a precursor to the '2
step' process documented.

Clarify by declaring this a 3 step process starting with setting the
fields of struct auxiliary_device correctly.

Also add some sample code and tie the change into the rest of the
documentation.
