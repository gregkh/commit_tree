drm/amd/display: Query DMCUB for dp alt status

[Why]
To avoid hanging RDPCSPIPE when INTERCEPTB isn't set.

DMCUB owns control of that bit so DMCUB should manage returning the
information driver needs for link encoder control.

[How]
Add a new DMCUB command to return dp alt disable and dp4 information.
