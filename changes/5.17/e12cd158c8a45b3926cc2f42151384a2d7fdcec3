selftests/bpf: Configure dir paths via env in test_bpftool_synctypes.py

Script test_bpftool_synctypes.py parses a number of files in the bpftool
directory (or even elsewhere in the repo) to make sure that the list of
types or options in those different files are consistent. Instead of
having fixed paths, let's make the directories configurable through
environment variable. This should make easier in the future to run the
script in a different setup, for example on an out-of-tree bpftool
mirror with a different layout.
