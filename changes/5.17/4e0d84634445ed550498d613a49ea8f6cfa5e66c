futex: Fix sparc32/m68k/nds32 build regression

The recent futex cleanup series, botched up a rename of some function
names, breaking sparc32, m68k and nds32:

include/asm-generic/futex.h:17:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic_local_generic'; did you mean 'futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic_local'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

Fix the macros to point to the correct functions.

Fixes: 3f2bedabb62c ("futex: Ensure futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() is present")
