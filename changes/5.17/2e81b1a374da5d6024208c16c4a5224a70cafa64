scsi: lpfc: Change return code on I/Os received during link bounce

During heavy I/O testing with issue_lip to bounce the link, occasionally
I/O is terminated with status 3 result 9, which means the RPI is suspended.
The I/O is completed and this type of error will result in immediate retry
by the SCSI layer. The retry count expires and the I/O fails and returns
error to the application.

To avoid these quick retry/retries exhausted scenarios change the return
code given to the midlayer to DID_REQUEUE rather than DID_ERROR. This gets
them retried, and eventually succeed when the link recovers.
