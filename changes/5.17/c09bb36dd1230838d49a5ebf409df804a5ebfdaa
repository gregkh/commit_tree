drm/amd/display: Secondary display goes blank on Non DCN31

[Why]
Due to integration issues with branch merging,
a regression happened that prevented secondary
displays from lighting up or enabling certain features

[How]
Separated the new logic to be for DCN31 only and retained
pre DCN31 logic for all other ASICs
