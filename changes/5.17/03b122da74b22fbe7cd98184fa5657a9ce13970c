x86/sgx: Hook arch_memory_failure() into mainline code

Add a call inside memory_failure() to call the arch specific code
to check if the address is an SGX EPC page and handle it.

Note the SGX EPC pages do not have a "struct page" entry, so the hook
goes in at the same point as the device mapping hook.

Pull the call to acquire the mutex earlier so the SGX errors are also
protected.

Make set_mce_nospec() skip SGX pages when trying to adjust
the 1:1 map.
