btrfs: add inode to truncate control

In the future we're going to want to use btrfs_truncate_inode_items
without looking up the associated inode.  In order to accommodate this
add the inode to btrfs_truncate_control and handle the case where
control->inode is NULL appropriately.  This is fairly straightforward,
we simply need to add a helper for the trace points, as the file extent
map update is controlled by a flag on btrfs_truncate_control.
