can: hi311x: hi3110_can_probe(): use devm_clk_get_optional() to get the input clock

It's not clear what was the intention of redundant usage of IS_ERR()
around the clock pointer since with the error check of devm_clk_get()
followed by bailout it can't be invalid,

Simplify the code which fetches the input clock by using
devm_clk_get_optional(). It will allow to switch to device properties
approach in the future.
