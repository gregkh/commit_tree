net: Fix esp GSO on inter address family tunnels.

The esp tunnel GSO handlers use skb_mac_gso_segment to
push the inner packet to the segmentation handlers.
However, skb_mac_gso_segment takes the Ethernet Protocol
ID from 'skb->protocol' which is wrong for inter address
family tunnels. We fix this by introducing a new
skb_eth_gso_segment function.

This function can be used if it is necessary to pass the
Ethernet Protocol ID directly to the segmentation handler.
First users of this function will be the esp4 and esp6
tunnel segmentation handlers.
