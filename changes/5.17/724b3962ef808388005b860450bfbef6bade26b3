KVM: VMX: Move Posted Interrupt ndst computation out of write loop

Hoist the CPU => APIC ID conversion for the Posted Interrupt descriptor
out of the loop to write the descriptor, preemption is disabled so the
CPU won't change, and if the APIC ID changes KVM has bigger problems.

No functional change intended.
