drm/amd/display: Set plane update flags for all planes in reset

[Why]
We're only setting the flags on stream[0]'s planes so this logic fails
if we have more than one stream in the state.

This can cause a page flip timeout with multiple displays in the
configuration.

[How]
Index into the stream_status array using the stream index - it's a 1:1
mapping.
