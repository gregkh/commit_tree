RDMA/siw: Fix broken RDMA Read Fence/Resume logic.

Code unconditionally resumed fenced SQ processing after next RDMA Read
completion, even if other RDMA Read responses are still outstanding, or
ORQ is full. Also adds comments for better readability of fence
processing, and removes orq_get_tail() helper, which is not needed
anymore.
