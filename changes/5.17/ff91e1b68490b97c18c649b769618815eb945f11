net: dsa: fix incorrect function pointer check for MRP ring roles

The cross-chip notifier boilerplate code meant to check the presence of
ds->ops->port_mrp_add_ring_role before calling it, but checked
ds->ops->port_mrp_add instead, before calling
ds->ops->port_mrp_add_ring_role.

Therefore, a driver which implements one operation but not the other
would trigger a NULL pointer dereference.

There isn't any such driver in DSA yet, so there is no reason to
backport the change. Issue found through code inspection.
