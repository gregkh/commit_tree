Documentation: ACPI: Fix data node reference documentation

The data node reference documentation was missing a package that must
contain the property values, instead property name and multiple values
being present in a single package. This is not aligned with the _DSD
spec.

Fix it by adding the package for the values.

Also add the missing "reg" properties to two numbered nodes.
