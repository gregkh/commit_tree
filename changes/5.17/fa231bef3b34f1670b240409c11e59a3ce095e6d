soc: imx: gpcv2: Fix clock disabling imbalance in error path

The imx_pgc_power_down() starts by enabling the domain clocks, and thus
disables them in the error path. Commit 18c98573a4cf ("soc: imx: gpcv2:
add domain option to keep domain clocks enabled") made the clock enable
conditional, but forgot to add the same condition to the error path.
This can result in a clock enable/disable imbalance. Fix it.
