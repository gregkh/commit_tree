exit: Coredumps reach do_group_exit

The comment about coredumps not reaching do_group_exit and the
corresponding BUG_ON are bogus.

What happens and has happened for years is that get_signal calls
do_coredump (which sets SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT and group_exit_code) and
then do_group_exit passing the signal number.  Then do_group_exit
ignores the exit_code it is passed and uses signal->group_exit_code
from the coredump.

The comment and BUG_ON were correct when they were added during the
2.5 development cycle, but became obsolete and incorrect when
get_signal was changed to fall through to do_group_exit after
do_coredump in 2.6.10-rc2.

So remove the stale comment and BUG_ON
