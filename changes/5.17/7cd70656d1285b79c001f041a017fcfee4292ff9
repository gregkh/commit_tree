drm/bridge: display-connector: implement bus fmts callbacks

Since this bridge is tied to the connector, it acts like a passthrough,
so concerning the output & input bus formats, either pass the bus formats from the
previous bridge or return fallback data like done in the bridge function:
drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts() & select_bus_fmt_recursive.

This permits avoiding skipping the negociation if the remaining bridge chain has
all the bits in place.

Without this bus fmt negociation breaks on drm/meson HDMI pipeline when attaching
dw-hdmi with DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR, because the last bridge of the
display-connector doesn't implement buf fmt callbacks and MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED
is used leading to select an unsupported default bus format from dw-hdmi.
