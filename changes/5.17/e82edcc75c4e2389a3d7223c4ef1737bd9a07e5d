KVM: arm64: Implement do_share() helper for sharing memory

By default, protected KVM isolates memory pages so that they are
accessible only to their owner: be it the host kernel, the hypervisor
at EL2 or (in future) the guest. Establishing shared-memory regions
between these components therefore involves a transition for each page
so that the owner can share memory with a borrower under a certain set
of permissions.

Introduce a do_share() helper for safely sharing a memory region between
two components. Currently, only host-to-hyp sharing is implemented, but
the code is easily extended to handle other combinations and the
permission checks for each component are reusable.
