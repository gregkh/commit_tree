hwmon: (pmbus) Add Delta AHE-50DC fan control module driver

This device is an integrated module of the Delta AHE-50DC Open19 power
shelf.  I haven't been able to procure any proper documentation for
it, but it seems to be a (somewhat minimally) PMBus-compliant device.
It provides four fan speeds, four temperatures (three standard and one
manufacturer-specific via a virtual second page), and a vin reading.
