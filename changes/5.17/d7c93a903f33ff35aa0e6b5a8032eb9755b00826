usb: dwc3: pci: Add "snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk" for Intel Bay Trail

Commit e0082698b689 ("usb: dwc3: ulpi: conditionally resume ULPI PHY")
fixed an issue where ULPI transfers would timeout if any requests where
send to the phy sometime after init, giving it enough time to auto-suspend.

Commit e5f4ca3fce90 ("usb: dwc3: ulpi: Fix USB2.0 HS/FS/LS PHY suspend
regression") changed the behavior to instead of clearing the
DWC3_GUSB2PHYCFG_SUSPHY bit, add an extra sleep when it is set.

But on Bay Trail devices, when phy_set_mode() gets called during init,
this leads to errors like these:
[   28.451522] tusb1210 dwc3.ulpi: error -110 writing val 0x01 to reg 0x0a
[   28.464089] tusb1210 dwc3.ulpi: error -110 writing val 0x01 to reg 0x0a

Add "snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk" to the settings for Bay Trail devices to
fix this. This restores the old behavior for Bay Trail devices, since
previously the DWC3_GUSB2PHYCFG_SUSPHY bit would get cleared on the first
ulpi_read/_write() and then was never set again.
