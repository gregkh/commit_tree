tools/runqslower: Enable cross-building with clang

Cross-building using clang requires passing the "-target" flag rather
than using the CROSS_COMPILE prefix. Makefile.include transforms
CROSS_COMPILE into CLANG_CROSS_FLAGS. Add them to CFLAGS, and erase
CROSS_COMPILE for the bpftool build, since it needs to be executed on
the host.
