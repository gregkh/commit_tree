net: dsa: make dp->bridge_num one-based

I have seen too many bugs already due to the fact that we must encode an
invalid dp->bridge_num as a negative value, because the natural tendency
is to check that invalid value using (!dp->bridge_num). Latest example
can be seen in commit 1bec0f05062c ("net: dsa: fix bridge_num not
getting cleared after ports leaving the bridge").

Convert the existing users to assume that dp->bridge_num == 0 is the
encoding for invalid, and valid bridge numbers start from 1.
