powerpc/xmon: Add __init attribute to eligible functions

`xmon_register_spus` defined in 'arch/powerpc/xmon' is deserving of an
`__init` macro attribute. This functions is only called by other
initialization functions and therefore should inherit the attribute.
Also, change the function declaration in the header file to include
`__init`.
