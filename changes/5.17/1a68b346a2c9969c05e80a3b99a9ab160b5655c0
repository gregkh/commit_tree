ACPI: Change acpi_device_always_present() into acpi_device_override_status()

Currently, acpi_bus_get_status() calls acpi_device_always_present() to
allow platform quirks to override the _STA return to report that a
device is present (status = ACPI_STA_DEFAULT) independent of the _STA
return.

In some cases it might also be useful to have the opposite functionality
and have a platform quirk which marks a device as not present (status = 0)
to work around ACPI table bugs.

Change acpi_device_always_present() into a more generic
acpi_device_override_status() function to allow this.
