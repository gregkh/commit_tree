netfs: Make ops->init_rreq() optional

Make the ops->init_rreq() callback optional.  This isn't required for the
erofs changes I'm implementing to do on-demand read through fscache[1].
Further, ceph has an empty init_rreq method that can then be removed and
it's marked optional in the documentation.
