platform/x86: int3472: Split into 2 drivers

The intel_skl_int3472.ko module contains 2 separate drivers,
the int3472_discrete platform driver and the int3472_tps68470
I2C-driver.

These 2 drivers contain very little shared code, only
skl_int3472_get_acpi_buffer() and skl_int3472_fill_cldb() are
shared.

Split the module into 2 drivers, linking the little shared code
directly into both.

This will allow us to add soft-module dependencies for the
tps68470 clk, gpio and regulator drivers to the new
intel_skl_int3472_tps68470.ko to help with probe ordering issues
without causing these modules to get loaded on boards which only
use the int3472_discrete platform driver.

While at it also rename the .c and .h files to remove the
cumbersome intel_skl_int3472_ prefix.
