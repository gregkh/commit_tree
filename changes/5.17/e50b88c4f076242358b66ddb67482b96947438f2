nl80211: Update bss channel on channel switch for P2P_CLIENT

The wdev channel information is updated post channel switch only for
the station mode and not for the other modes. Due to this, the P2P client
still points to the old value though it moved to the new channel
when the channel change is induced from the P2P GO.

Update the bss channel after CSA channel switch completion for P2P client
interface as well.
