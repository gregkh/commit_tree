scsi: libsas: Resume host while sending SMP I/Os

When sending SMP I/Os to the host we need to ensure that the host is not
suspended and can process the commands. This is a better approach than
replying on the host to resume itself to handle such commands. Use
pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_sync() calls for the host when
executing SMP I/Os.
