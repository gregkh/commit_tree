KVM: selftests: aarch64: Add vgic_irq to test userspace IRQ injection

Add a new KVM selftest, vgic_irq, for testing userspace IRQ injection.  This
particular test injects an SPI using KVM_IRQ_LINE on GICv3 and verifies
that the IRQ is handled in the guest. The next commits will add more
types of IRQs and different modes.
