kasan: test: add globals left-out-of-bounds test

Add a test checking that KASAN generic can also detect out-of-bounds
accesses to the left of globals.

Unfortunately it seems that GCC doesn't catch this (tested GCC 10, 11).
The main difference between GCC's globals redzoning and Clang's is that
GCC relies on using increased alignment to producing padding, where
Clang's redzoning implementation actually adds real data after the
global and doesn't rely on alignment to produce padding.  I believe this
is the main reason why GCC can't reliably catch globals out-of-bounds in
this case.

Given this is now a known issue, to avoid failing the whole test suite,
skip this test case with GCC.
