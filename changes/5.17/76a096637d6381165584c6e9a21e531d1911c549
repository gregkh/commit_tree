dmaengine: jz4780: Support bidirectional I/O on one channel

For some devices with only half-duplex capabilities, it doesn't make
much sense to use one DMA channel per direction, as both channels will
never be active at the same time.

Add support for bidirectional I/O on DMA channels. The client drivers
can then request a "tx-rx" DMA channel which will be used for both
directions.
