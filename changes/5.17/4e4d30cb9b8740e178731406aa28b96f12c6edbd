KVM: Resync only arch fields when slots_arch_lock gets reacquired

There is no need to copy the whole memslot data after releasing
slots_arch_lock for a moment to install temporary memslots copy in
kvm_set_memslot() since this lock only protects the arch field of each
memslot.

Just resync this particular field after reacquiring slots_arch_lock.

Note, this also eliminates the need to manually clear the INVALID flag
when restoring memslots; the "setting" of the INVALID flag was an
unwanted side effect of copying the entire memslots.

Since kvm_copy_memslots() has just one caller remaining now
open-code it instead.
