blk-mq: simplify the plug handling in blk_mq_submit_bio

blk_mq_submit_bio has two different plug cases, one that uses full
plugging and a limited plugging one.

The limited plugging case is only used for a corner case that does
not matter in real life:

 - no ->commit_rqs (so not NVMe)
 - no shared tags (so not SCSI)
 - not rotational (so no old disk or floppy driver)
 - must have multiple queues (so no eMMC)

Remove the limited merging case and all the related junk to simplify
blk_mq_submit_bio and the functions called from it.
