perf vendor events: Rename arm64 arch std event files

A previous commit adds pmu events into the files

  armv8-common-and-microarch.json
  armv8-recommended.json

that are actually specified in an armv9 reference supplement, not armv8.
As such, naming the files with the armv8 prefix seems artificial.

This patch renames the files to reflect that these two files are for
arch std events regardless of whether they are defined in armv8 or
armv9.
