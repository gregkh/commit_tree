dmaengine: at_xdmac: Move the free desc to the tail of the desc list

Move the free desc to the tail of the list, so that the sequence of
descriptors is more track-able in case of debug. One would know which
descriptor should come next and could easier catch concurrency over
descriptors for example. virt-dma uses list_splice_tail_init() as well,
follow the core driver.
