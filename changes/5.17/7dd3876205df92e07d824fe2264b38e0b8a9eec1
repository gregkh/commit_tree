PCI: kirin: Add dev struct for of_device_get_match_data()

Bean reported that a622435fbe1a ("PCI: kirin: Prefer
of_device_get_match_data()") broke kirin_pcie_probe() because it assumed
match data of 0 was a failure when in fact, it meant the match data was
"(void *)PCIE_KIRIN_INTERNAL_PHY".

Therefore, probing of "hisilicon,kirin960-pcie" devices failed with -EINVAL
and an "OF data missing" message.

Add a struct kirin_pcie_data to encode the PHY type.  Then the result of
of_device_get_match_data() should always be a non-NULL pointer to a struct
kirin_pcie_data that contains the PHY type.

Fixes: a622435fbe1a ("PCI: kirin: Prefer of_device_get_match_data()")
