drm/ingenic: Add support for private objects

Until now, the ingenic-drm as well as the ingenic-ipu drivers used to
put state-specific information in their respective private structure.

Add boilerplate code to support private objects in the two drivers, so
that state-specific information can be put in the state-specific private
structure.
