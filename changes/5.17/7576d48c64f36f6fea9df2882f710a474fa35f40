scsi: lpfc: Fix lpfc_force_rscn ndlp kref imbalance

Issuing lpfc_force_rscn twice results in an ndlp kref use-after-free call
trace.

A prior patch reworked the get/put handling by ensuring nlp_get was done
before WQE submission and a put was done in the completion path.
Unfortunately, the issue_els_rscn path had a piece of legacy code that did
a nlp_put, causing an imbalance on the ref counts.

Fixed by removing the unnecessary legacy code snippet.
