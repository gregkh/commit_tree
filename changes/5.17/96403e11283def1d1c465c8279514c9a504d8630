mm: prevent vm_area_struct::anon_name refcount saturation

A deep process chain with many vmas could grow really high.  With
default sysctl_max_map_count (64k) and default pid_max (32k) the max
number of vmas in the system is 2147450880 and the refcounter has
headroom of 1073774592 before it reaches REFCOUNT_SATURATED
(3221225472).

Therefore it's unlikely that an anonymous name refcounter will overflow
with these defaults.  Currently the max for pid_max is PID_MAX_LIMIT
(4194304) and for sysctl_max_map_count it's INT_MAX (2147483647).  In
this configuration anon_vma_name refcount overflow becomes theoretically
possible (that still require heavy sharing of that anon_vma_name between
processes).

kref refcounting interface used in anon_vma_name structure will detect a
counter overflow when it reaches REFCOUNT_SATURATED value but will only
generate a warning and freeze the ref counter.  This would lead to the
refcounted object never being freed.  A determined attacker could leak
memory like that but it would be rather expensive and inefficient way to
do so.

To ensure anon_vma_name refcount does not overflow, stop anon_vma_name
sharing when the refcount reaches REFCOUNT_MAX (2147483647), which still
leaves INT_MAX/2 (1073741823) values before the counter reaches
REFCOUNT_SATURATED.  This should provide enough headroom for raising the
refcounts temporarily.
