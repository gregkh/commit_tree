net: dsa: sja1105: move ts_id from sja1105_tagger_data

The TX timestamp ID is incremented by the SJA1110 PTP timestamping
callback (->port_tx_timestamp) for every packet, when cloning it.
It isn't used by the tagger at all, even though it sits inside the
struct sja1105_tagger_data.

Also, serialization to this structure is currently done through
tagger_data->meta_lock, which is a cheap hack because the meta_lock
isn't used for anything else on SJA1110 (sja1105_rcv_meta_state_machine
isn't called).

This change moves ts_id from sja1105_tagger_data to sja1105_private and
introduces a dedicated spinlock for it, also in sja1105_private.
