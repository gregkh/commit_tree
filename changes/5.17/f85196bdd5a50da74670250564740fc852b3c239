ACPI: scan: Create platform device for BCM4752 and LNV4752 ACPI nodes

BCM4752 and LNV4752 ACPI nodes describe a Broadcom 4752 GPS module
attached to an UART of the system.

The GPS modules talk a custom protocol which only works with a closed-
source Android gpsd daemon which knows this protocol.

The ACPI nodes also describe GPIOs to turn the GPS on/off these are
handled by the net/rfkill/rfkill-gpio.c code. This handling predates the
addition of enumeration of ACPI instantiated serdevs to the kernel and
was broken by that addition, because the ACPI scan code now no longer
instantiates platform_device-s for these nodes.

Rename the i2c_multi_instantiate_ids HID list to ignore_serial_bus_ids
and add the BCM4752 and LNV4752 HIDs, so that rfkill-gpio gets
a platform_device to bind to again; and so that a tty cdev for gpsd
gets created for these.
