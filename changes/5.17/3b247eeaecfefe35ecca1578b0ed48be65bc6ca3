ASoC: wcd9335: Keep a RX port value for each SLIM RX mux

Currently, rx_port_value is a single unsigned int that gets overwritten
when slim_rx_mux_put() is called for any RX mux, then the same value is
read when slim_rx_mux_get() is called for any of them. This results in
slim_rx_mux_get() reporting the last value set by slim_rx_mux_put()
regardless of which SLIM RX mux is in question.

Turn rx_port_value into an array and store a separate value for each
SLIM RX mux.
