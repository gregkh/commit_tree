net/mlx5e: Add profile indications for PTP and QOS HTB features

Let the profile indicate support of the PTP and HTB (QOS) features.
This unifies the logic that calculates the number of netdev queues needed
for the features, and allows simplification of mlx5e_create_netdev(),
which no longer requires number of rx/tx queues as parameters.
