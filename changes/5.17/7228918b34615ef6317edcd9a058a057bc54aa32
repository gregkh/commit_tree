x86/boot: Fix memremap of setup_indirect structures

As documented, the setup_indirect structure is nested inside
the setup_data structures in the setup_data list. The code currently
accesses the fields inside the setup_indirect structure but only
the sizeof(struct setup_data) is being memremapped. No crash
occurred but this is just due to how the area is remapped under the
covers.

Properly memremap both the setup_data and setup_indirect structures
in these cases before accessing them.
