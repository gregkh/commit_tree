drm/vc4: hdmi: Warn if we access the controller while disabled

We've had many silent hangs where the kernel would look like it just
stalled due to the access to one of the HDMI registers while the
controller was disabled.

Add a warning if we're about to do that so that it's at least not silent
anymore.
