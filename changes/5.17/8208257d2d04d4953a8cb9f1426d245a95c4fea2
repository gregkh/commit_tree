configs/debug: restore DEBUG_INFO=y for overriding

Previously, I failed to realize that Kees' patch [1] has not been merged
into the mainline yet, and dropped DEBUG_INFO=y too eagerly from the
mainline.  As the results, "make debug.config" won't be able to flip
DEBUG_INFO=n from the existing .config.  This should close the gaps of a
few weeks before Kees' patch is there, and work regardless of their
merging status anyway.
