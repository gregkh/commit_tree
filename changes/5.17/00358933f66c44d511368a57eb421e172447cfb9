brd: remove brd_devices_mutex mutex

If brd_alloc() from brd_probe() is called before brd_alloc() from
brd_init() is called, module loading will fail with -EEXIST error.
To close this race, call __register_blkdev() just before leaving
brd_init().

Then, we can remove brd_devices_mutex mutex, for brd_device list
will no longer be accessed concurrently.
