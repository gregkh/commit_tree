ASoC: SOF: Add 'non_recoverable' parameter to snd_sof_dsp_panic()

Some platforms use retries during firmware boot to overcome DSP startup
issues.
In these cases we might receive a DSP panic message which should not be
treated as fatal if it happens during boot.

Pass this information to snd_sof_dsp_panic() and omit the panic print if
it is not fatal or the user does not want to see all dumps.
