media: uvcvideo: fix division by zero at stream start

Add the missing bulk-endpoint max-packet sanity check to
uvc_video_start_transfer() to avoid division by zero in
uvc_alloc_urb_buffers() in case a malicious device has broken
descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).

Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip
endpoint descriptors with maxpacket=0")).
