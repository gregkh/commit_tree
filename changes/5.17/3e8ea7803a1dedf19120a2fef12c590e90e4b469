x86/vmx: Remove .fixup usage

In the vmread exceptin path, use the, thus far, unused output register
to push the @fault argument onto the stack. This, in turn, enables the
exception handler to not do pushes and only modify that register when
an exception does occur.

As noted by Sean the input constraint needs to be changed to "=&r" to
avoid the value and field occupying the same register.
