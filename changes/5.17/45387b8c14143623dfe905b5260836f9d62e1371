mm/slub: Convert alloc_slab_page() to return a struct slab

Preparatory, callers convert back to struct page for now.

Also move setting page flags to alloc_slab_page() where we still operate
on a struct page. This means the page->slab_cache pointer is now set
later than the PageSlab flag, which could theoretically confuse some pfn
walker assuming PageSlab means there would be a valid cache pointer. But
as the code had no barriers and used __set_bit() anyway, it could have
happened already, so there shouldn't be such a walker.
