iwlwifi: integrate with iwlmei

iwlmei needs to know about the follwing events:

* Association
* De-association
* Country Code change
* SW Rfkill change
* SAR table changes

iwlmei can take the device away from us, so report the new
rfkill type when this happens.
Advertise the required data from the CSME firmware to the
usersapce: mostly, the AP that the CSME firmware is currently
associated to in case there is an active link protection
session.
Generate the HOST_ASSOC / HOST_DISSASSOC messages.

Don't support WPA1 (non-RSNA) for now.
Don't support shared wep either.
We can then determine the AUTH parameter by checking the AKM.
Feed the cipher from the key installation.

SW Rfkill will be implemented later when cfg80211 will
allow us to read the SW Rfkill state.

v7: Ayala added her signed-off
    remove pointless function declaration
    fix a bug due to merge conflict in the HOST_ASSOC message

    not support (yet)
