refscale: Prevent buffer to pr_alert() being too long

0Day/LKP observed that the refscale results fail to complete when larger
values of nrun (such as 300) are specified.  The problem is that printk()
can accept at most a 1024-byte buffer.  This commit therefore prints
the buffer whenever its length exceeds 800 bytes.
