s390/pci: simplify __pciwb_mio() inline asm

The PCI Write Barrier instruction ignores the registers encoded in it.
There is thus no need to explicitly set the register to zero or to
associate it with a variable at all. In the resulting binary this removes
an unnecessary lghi and it makes the code simpler.
