x86/kvm: Fix compilation warning in non-x86_64 builds

On non-x86_64 builds, helpers gtod_is_based_on_tsc() and
kvm_guest_supported_xfd() are defined but never used.  Because these are
static inline but are in a .c file, some compilers do warn for them with
-Wunused-function, which becomes an error if -Werror is present.

Add #ifdef so they are only defined in x86_64 builds.
