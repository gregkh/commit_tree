Input: silead - add pen support

Some Silead touchscreens have support for an active (battery powered)
pen, add support for this.

So far pen-support has only been seen on X86/ACPI (non devicetree) devs,
IOW it is not used in actual devicetree files. The devicetree-bindings
maintainers have requested properties like these to not be added to the
devicetree-bindings, so the new properties are deliberately not added
to the existing silead devicetree-bindings documentation.
