r8169: enable ASPM L1/L1.1 from RTL8168h

With newer chip versions ASPM-related issues seem to occur only if
L1.2 is enabled. I have a test system with RTL8168h that gives a
number of rx_missed errors when running iperf and L1.2 is enabled.
With L1.2 disabled (and L1 + L1.1 active) everything is fine.
See also [0]. Can't test this, but L1 + L1.1 being active should be
sufficient to reach higher package power saving states.
