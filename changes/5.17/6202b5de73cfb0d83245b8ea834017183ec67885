backlight: lp855x: Add support ACPI enumeration

The Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 tablet uses an ACPI enumerated LP8556 backlight
controller for its LCD-panel, with a Xiaomi specific ACPI HID of
"XMCC0001", add support for this.

Note the new "if (id)" check also fixes a NULL pointer deref when a user
tries to manually bind the driver from sysfs.

When CONFIG_ACPI is disabled acpi_match_device() will always return NULL,
so the lp855x_parse_acpi() call will get optimized away.
