mtd: rawnand: ingenic: JZ4740 needs 'oob_first' read page function

The ECC engine on the JZ4740 SoC requires the ECC data to be read before
the page; using the default page reading function does not work. Indeed,
the old JZ4740 NAND driver (removed in 5.4) did use the 'OOB first' flag
that existed back then.

Use the newly created nand_read_page_hwecc_oob_first() to address this
issue.

This issue was not found when the new ingenic-nand driver was developed,
most likely because the Device Tree used had the nand-ecc-mode set to
"hw_oob_first", which seems to not be supported anymore.
