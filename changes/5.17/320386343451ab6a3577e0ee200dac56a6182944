ASoC: fsl_asrc: refine the check of available clock divider

According to RM, the clock divider range is from 1 to 8, clock
prescaling ratio may be any power of 2 from 1 to 128.
So the supported divider is not all the value between
1 and 1024, just limited value in that range.

Create table for the supported divder and add function to
check the clock divider is available by comparing with
the table.
