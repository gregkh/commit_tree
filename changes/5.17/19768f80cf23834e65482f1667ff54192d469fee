block: null_blk: only set set->nr_maps as 3 if active poll_queues is > 0

It isn't correct to set set->nr_maps as 3 if g_poll_queues is > 0 since
we can change it via configfs for null_blk device created there, so only
set it as 3 if active poll_queues is > 0.

Fixes divide zero exception reported by Shinichiro.
