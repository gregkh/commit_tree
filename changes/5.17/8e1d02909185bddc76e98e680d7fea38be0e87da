btrfs: use chunk_root in find_free_extent_update_loop

We're only using this to start the transaction with to possibly allocate
a chunk.  It doesn't really matter which root to use, but with extent
tree v2 we'll need a bytenr to look up a extent root which makes the
usage of the extent_root awkward here.  Simply change it to the
chunk_root.
