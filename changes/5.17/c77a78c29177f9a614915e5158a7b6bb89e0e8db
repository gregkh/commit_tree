tools build: Enable warnings through HOSTCFLAGS

The tools build system uses KBUILD_HOSTCFLAGS symbol for obvious purposes.

However this is not set for anything under tools/

As such, host tools apps built have no compiler warnings enabled.

Declare HOSTCFLAGS for perf tools build, and also use that symbol in
declaration of host_c_flags. HOSTCFLAGS comes from EXTRA_WARNINGS, which
is independent of target platform/arch warning flags.
