fsnotify: separate mark iterator type from object type enum

They are two different types that use the same enum, so this confusing.

Use the object type to indicate the type of object mark is attached to
and the iter type to indicate the type of watch.

A group can have two different watches of the same object type (parent
and child watches) that match the same event.
