ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for Legion Y9000X 2020

Legion Y9000X 2020 has a speaker, but the speaker doesn't work.
This can be fixed by applying alc285_fixup_ideapad_s740_coef
to fix the speaker's coefficients.
Besides, to support the transition between the speaker and the headphone,
alc287_fixup_legion_15imhg05_speakers needs to be run.
