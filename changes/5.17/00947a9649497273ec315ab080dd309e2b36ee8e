mtd: spi-nor: winbond: Use manufacturer late_init() for OTP ops

OTP is not described in the JESD216 SFDP standard, place the
OTP ops init in late_init().

We can't get rid of the default_init() hook for winbond, as the
4byte_addr_mode is SFDP specific and will require to have all
flashes at hand, in order to check which has the SFDP tables defined,
in which case there's nothing to do if the SFDP tables are corect,
and which of the flashes do not define the SFDP tables in which case
each flash should declare a late_init() fixup.
