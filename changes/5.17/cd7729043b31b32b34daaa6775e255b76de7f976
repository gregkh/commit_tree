libtraceevent: Add __rel_loc relative location attribute support

Add '__rel_loc' new dynamic data location attribute which encodes
the data location from the next to the field itself. This is similar
to the '__data_loc' but the location offset is not from the event
entry but from the next of the field.

This patch adds '__rel_loc' decoding support in the libtraceevent.
