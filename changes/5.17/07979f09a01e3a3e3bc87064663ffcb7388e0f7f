dt-bindings: arm,cci-400: Drop the PL330 from example

The PL330 was commented out because its binding wasn't converted to a
schema. With the binding converted, the example now needs several updates.
However, while it's possible that the PL330 has a 'cci-control-port', there
aren't any platforms upstream which do. So rather than allowing
'cci-control-port' in the PL330 binding, let's just drop the example.
