chelsio: cxgb: Use dma_set_mask_and_coherent() and simplify code

Use dma_set_mask_and_coherent() instead of unrolling it with some
dma_set_mask()+dma_set_coherent_mask().

Moreover, as stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask will never
fail if dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

That said, 'pci_using_dac' can only be 1 after a successful
dma_set_mask_and_coherent().

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.
