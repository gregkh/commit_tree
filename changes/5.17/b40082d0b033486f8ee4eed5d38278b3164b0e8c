platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Add TM800A550L data

The whitelabel (sold as various brands) TM800A550L tablets's DSDT contains
a whole bunch of bogus ACPI I2C devices and the ACPI node describing
the touchscreen is bad (the IRQ is missing). Enumeration of these is
skipped through the acpi_quirk_skip_i2c_client_enumeration().

Add support for manually instantiating the (now) missing I2C devices by
adding the necessary device info to the x86-android-tablets module,
including instantiating an actually working i2c-client for
the touchscreen.
