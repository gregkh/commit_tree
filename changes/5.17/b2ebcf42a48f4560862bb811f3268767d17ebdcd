ASoC: SOF: free widgets in sof_tear_down_pipelines() for static pipelines

Free widgets for static pipelines in sof_tear_down_pipelines().
But this feature is unavailable in older firmware with ABI < 3.19.
Just reset widget use_count's for this case. This would ensure that
the secondary cores enabled required for topology setup are powered
down properly before the primary core is powered off during
system suspend.
