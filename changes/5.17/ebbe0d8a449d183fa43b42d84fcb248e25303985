tools/nolibc: i386: fix initial stack alignment

After re-checking in the spec and comparing stack offsets with glibc,
The last pushed argument must be 16-byte aligned (i.e. aligned before the
call) so that in the callee esp+4 is multiple of 16, so the principle is
the 32-bit equivalent to what Ammar fixed for x86_64. It's possible that
32-bit code using SSE2 or MMX could have been affected. In addition the
frame pointer ought to be zero at the deepest level.
