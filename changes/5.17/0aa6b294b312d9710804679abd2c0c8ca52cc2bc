ALSA: intel_hdmi: Fix reference to PCM buffer address

PCM buffers might be allocated dynamically when the buffer
preallocation failed or a larger buffer is requested, and it's not
guaranteed that substream->dma_buffer points to the actually used
buffer.  The driver needs to refer to substream->runtime->dma_addr
instead for the buffer address.
