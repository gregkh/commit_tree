sched/rt: Try to restart rt period timer when rt runtime exceeded

When rt_runtime is modified from -1 to a valid control value, it may
cause the task to be throttled all the time. Operations like the following
will trigger the bug. E.g:

  1. echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
  2. Run a FIFO task named A that executes while(1)
  3. echo 950000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us

When rt_runtime is -1, The rt period timer will not be activated when task
A enqueued. And then the task will be throttled after setting rt_runtime to
950,000. The task will always be throttled because the rt period timer is
not activated.
