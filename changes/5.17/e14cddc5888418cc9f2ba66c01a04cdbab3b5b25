ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: clear stream before freeing the DAI widget

The DAI_CONFIG IPC that is sent during the STOP trigger is used for
stopping the DMA in the FW. This must be done after the DMA RUN bit is
cleared by the host. So move the call to snd_hdac_ext_link_stream_clear()
before hda_link_dai_widget_update() to follow the correct programming
sequence for DMA stop for HDA DAIs.
