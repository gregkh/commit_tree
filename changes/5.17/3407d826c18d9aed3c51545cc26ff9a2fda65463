firmware: edd: remove empty default_attrs array

The default_attrs array of attributes for the edd sysfs entries is
totally empty for some reason, and a list of attributes is added later
after the object is created (which should be fixed up later as it's
racy).  Because this pointer is never used, and is empty, and we are
trying to remove all default_attrs usages, just delete it.
