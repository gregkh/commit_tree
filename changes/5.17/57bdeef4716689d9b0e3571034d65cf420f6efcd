PCI: Add PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE and related definitions

A config or MMIO read from a PCI device that doesn't exist or doesn't
respond causes a PCI error. There's no real data to return to satisfy the
CPU read, so most hardware fabricates ~0 data.

Add a PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE definition for that and use it where appropriate
to make these checks consistent and easier to find.

Also add helper definitions PCI_SET_ERROR_RESPONSE() and
PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR() to make the code more readable.
