usb: ulpi: Call of_node_put correctly

of_node_put should always be called on device nodes gotten from
of_get_*. Additionally, it should only be called after there are no
remaining users. To address the first issue, call of_node_put if later
steps in ulpi_register fail. To address the latter, call put_device if
device_register fails, which will call ulpi_dev_release if necessary.
