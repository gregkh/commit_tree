tools/bpf: Rename 'struct event' to avoid naming conflict

On ppc64le, trying to build bpf seltests throws the below warning:
  In file included from runqslower.bpf.c:5:
  ./runqslower.h:7:8: error: redefinition of 'event'
  struct event {
	 ^
  /home/naveen/linux/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/tools/build/runqslower/vmlinux.h:156602:8:
  note: previous definition is here
  struct event {
	 ^

This happens since 'struct event' is defined in
drivers/net/ethernet/alteon/acenic.h . Rename the one in runqslower to a
more appropriate 'runq_event' to avoid the naming conflict.
