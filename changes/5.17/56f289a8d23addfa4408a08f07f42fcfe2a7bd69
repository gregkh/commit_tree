KVM: x86: Add a helper to retrieve userspace address from kvm_device_attr

Add a helper to handle converting the u64 userspace address embedded in
struct kvm_device_attr into a userspace pointer, it's all too easy to
forget the intermediate "unsigned long" cast as well as the truncation
check.

No functional change intended.
