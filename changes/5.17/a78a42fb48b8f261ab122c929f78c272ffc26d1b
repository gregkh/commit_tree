ASoC: qcom: apq8016_sbc: Allow routing audio through QDSP6

The apq8016-sbc-sndcard is designed to be used with the LPASS drivers
(bypassing the combined audio/modem DSP in MSM8916/APQ8016).
Make it possible to use QDSP6 audio instead for the msm8916-qdsp6-sndcard.

This only requires adding some additional hooks that set up the DPCM
backends correctly. Similar code is already used in drivers for newer
SoCs such as apq8096.c, sdm845.c and sm8250.c.

A slightly different initialization sequence is used for the apq8016-sbc
and msm8916-qdsp6 sound card by defining the apq8016_sbc_add_ops()
function as device match data.
