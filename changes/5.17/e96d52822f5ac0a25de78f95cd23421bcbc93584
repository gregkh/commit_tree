tpm_tis: Fix an error handling path in 'tpm_tis_core_init()'

Commit 79ca6f74dae0 ("tpm: fix Atmel TPM crash caused by too frequent
queries") has moved some code around without updating the error handling
path.

This is now pointless to 'goto out_err' when neither 'clk_enable()' nor
'ioremap()' have been called yet.

Make a direct return instead to avoid undoing things that have not been
done.
