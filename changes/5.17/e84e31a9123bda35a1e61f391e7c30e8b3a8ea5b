habanalabs: add dedicated message towards f/w to set power

CPUCP_PACKET_POWER_GET packet type was used for both
hl_get_power() and hl_set_power().

To align with other sensor functions hl_set_power()
should use CPUCP_PACKET_POWER_SET.

This packet will only be used with newer ASICs, so need to add
a compatibility flag to the asic properties to indicate whether to use
this packet or the GET packet.
