powerpc/code-patching: Reorganise do_patch_instruction() to ease error handling

Split do_patch_instruction() in two functions, the caller doing the
spin locking and the callee doing everything else.

And remove a few unnecessary initialisations and intermediate
variables.

This allows the callee to return from anywhere in the function.
