rcutorture: Avoid soft lockup during cpu stall

If we use the module stall_cpu option, we may get a soft lockup warning
in case we also don't pass the stall_cpu_block option.

Introduce the stall_no_softlockup option to avoid a soft lockup on
cpu stall even if we don't use the stall_cpu_block option.
