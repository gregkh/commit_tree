PCI: Use DWORD accesses for LTR, L1 SS to avoid erratum

Some devices have an erratum such that they only support DWORD accesses to
some registers.  E.g., this Bayhub O2 device ([VID:DID] = [0x1217:0x8621])
only supports DWORD accesses to LTR latency registers and L1 PM substates
control registers:

The L1 PM substate control registers are DWORD sized, and hence their
access in the kernel is already DWORD sized, so we don't need to do
anything for them.

However, the LTR registers being WORD sized, are in need of a solution.
Convert the WORD sized accesses to these registers into DWORD sized
accesses while saving and restoring them.
