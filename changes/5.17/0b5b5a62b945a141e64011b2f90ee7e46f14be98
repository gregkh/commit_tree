ext4: use ext4_ext_remove_space() for fast commit replay delete range

For now ,we use ext4_punch_hole() during fast commit replay delete range
procedure. But it will be affected by inode->i_size, which may not
correct during fast commit replay procedure. The following test will
failed.

-create & write foo (len 1000K)
-falloc FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE foo (range 400K - 600K)
-create & fsync bar
-falloc FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE foo (range 300K-500K)
-fsync foo
-crash before a full commit

After the fast_commit reply procedure, the range 400K-500K will not be
removed. Because in this case, when calling ext4_punch_hole() the
inode->i_size is 0, and it just retruns with doing nothing.

Change to use ext4_ext_remove_space() instead of ext4_punch_hole()
to remove blocks of inode directly.
