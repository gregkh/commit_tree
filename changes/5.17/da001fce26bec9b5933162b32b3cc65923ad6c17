s390/pgalloc: use pointers instead of unsigned long values

After adding the missing __va()/__pa() calls to the base asce
functions there are even more casts in the code than before. Make the
code more readable by passing and using pointers to page tables,
instead of using unsigned values for the same purpose.

This allows to get rid of nearly all casts within the code.
