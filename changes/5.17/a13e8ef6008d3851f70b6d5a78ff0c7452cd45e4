mmc: dw_mmc: exynos: use common_caps

Move the common MMC_CAP_CMD23 capability to common_caps so that only the
special case of MMC_CAP_1_8V_DDR and MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA are set via
caps/num_caps.  Both of those can, and should, be set via device tree
properties instead, so we can now say that exynos_dwmmc_caps is only
used for backwards compatibility.
