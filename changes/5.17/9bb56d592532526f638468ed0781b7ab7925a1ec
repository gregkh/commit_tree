FAT: use io_schedule_timeout() instead of congestion_wait()

congestion_wait() in this context is just a sleep - block devices do not
support congestion signalling any more.

The goal for this wait, which was introduced in commit ae78bf9c4f5f
("[PATCH] add -o flush for fat") is to wait for any recently written
data to get to storage.  We currently have no direct mechanism to do
this, so a simple wait that behaves identically to the current
congestion_wait() is the best we can do.

This is a step towards removing congestion_wait()
