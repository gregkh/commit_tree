ALSA: gus: Fix memory leaks at memory allocator error paths

When snd_gf1_mem_xalloc() returns NULL, the current code still leaves
the formerly allocated block.name string but returns an error
immediately.  This patch does code-refactoring to move the kstrdup()
call itself into snd_gf1_mem_xalloc() and deals with the resource free
in the helper code by itself for fixing those memory leaks.
