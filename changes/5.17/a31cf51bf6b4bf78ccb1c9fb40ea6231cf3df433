clk: renesas: rcar-gen3: Add dummy SDnH clock

Currently, SDnH is handled together with SDn. This caused lots of
problems, so we want SDnH as a separate clock. Introduce a dummy SDnH
type here which creates a fixed-factor clock with factor 1. That allows
us to convert the per-SoC CPG drivers while keeping the old behaviour
for now. A later patch then will add the proper functionality.
