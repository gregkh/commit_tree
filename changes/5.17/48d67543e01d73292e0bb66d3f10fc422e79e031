mlx5: Don't accidentally set RTO_ONLINK before mlx5e_route_lookup_ipv4_get()

Mask the ECN bits before calling mlx5e_route_lookup_ipv4_get(). The
tunnel key might have the last ECN bit set. This interferes with the
route lookup process as ip_route_output_key_hash() interpretes this bit
specially (to restrict the route scope).

Found by code inspection, compile tested only.
