cgroup/cpuset: Fix "suspicious RCU usage" lockdep warning

It was found that a "suspicious RCU usage" lockdep warning was issued
with the rcu_read_lock() call in update_sibling_cpumasks().  It is
because the update_cpumasks_hier() function may sleep. So we have
to release the RCU lock, call update_cpumasks_hier() and reacquire
it afterward.

Also add a percpu_rwsem_assert_held() in update_sibling_cpumasks()
instead of stating that in the comment.
