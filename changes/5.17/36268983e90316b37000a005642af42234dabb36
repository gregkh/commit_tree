Revert "ipv6: Honor all IPv6 PIO Valid Lifetime values"

This reverts commit b75326c201242de9495ff98e5d5cff41d7fc0d9d.

This commit breaks Linux compatibility with USGv6 tests. The RFC this
commit was based on is actually an expired draft: no published RFC
currently allows the new behaviour it introduced.

Without full IETF endorsement, the flash renumbering scenario this
patch was supposed to enable is never going to work, as other IPv6
equipements on the same LAN will keep the 2 hours limit.
