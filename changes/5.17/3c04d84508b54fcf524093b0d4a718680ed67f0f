riscv: Fix XIP_FIXUP_FLASH_OFFSET

There were several problems with the calculation. Not only was an 'and'
being computed into t1 but thrown away; but the 'and' itself would
cause problems if the granularity of the XIP physical address was less
than XIP_OFFSET - in my case I had the kernel image at 2MB in SPI flash.
