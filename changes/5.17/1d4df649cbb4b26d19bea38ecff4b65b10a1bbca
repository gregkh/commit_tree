irqchip/sifive-plic: Add missing thead,c900-plic match string

The thead,c900-plic has been used in opensbi to distinguish
PLIC [1]. Although PLICs have the same behaviors in Linux,
they are different hardware with some custom initializing in
firmware(opensbi).

Qute opensbi patch commit-msg by Samuel:

  The T-HEAD PLIC implementation requires setting a delegation bit
  to allow access from S-mode. Now that the T-HEAD PLIC has its own
  compatible string, set this bit automatically from the PLIC driver,
  instead of reaching into the PLIC's MMIO space from another driver.
