scsi: lpfc: Fix pt2pt NVMe PRLI reject LOGO loop

When connected point to point, the driver does not know the FC4's supported
by the other end. In Fabrics, it can query the nameserver.  Thus the driver
must send PRLIs for the FC4s it supports and enable support based on the
acc(ept) or rej(ect) of the respective FC4 PRLI.  Currently the driver
supports SCSI and NVMe PRLIs.

Unfortunately, although the behavior is per standard, many devices have
come to expect only SCSI PRLIs. In this particular example, the NVMe PRLI
is properly RJT'd but the target decided that it must LOGO after seeing the
unexpected NVMe PRLI. The LOGO causes the sequence to restart and login is
now in an infinite failure loop.

Fix the problem by having the driver, on a pt2pt link, remember NVMe PRLI
accept or reject status across logout as long as the link stays "up".  When
retrying login, if the prior NVMe PRLI was rejected, it will not be sent on
the next login.
