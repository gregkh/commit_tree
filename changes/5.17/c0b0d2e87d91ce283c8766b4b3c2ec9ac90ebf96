ath11k: Increment pending_mgmt_tx count before tx send invoke

There is a race condition whereby the tx completion handler can be invoked
before the 'num_pending_mgmt_tx" count is incremented. If that occurs, we
could get warning trace indicating that 'num_pending_mgmt_tx' is 0 (because
it was not yet incremented). Ideally, this trace should be seen only if
mgmt tx has not happened but tx completion is received, and it is not
expected in this race condition.
