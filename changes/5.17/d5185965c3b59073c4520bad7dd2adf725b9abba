gpu: host1x: Add back arm_iommu_detach_device()

Host1x DMA buffer isn't mapped properly when CONFIG_ARM_DMA_USE_IOMMU=y.
The memory management code of Host1x driver has a longstanding overhaul
overdue and it's not obvious where the problem is in this case. Hence
let's add back the old workaround which we already had sometime before.
It explicitly detaches Host1x device from the offending implicit IOMMU
domain. This fixes a completely broken Host1x DMA in case of ARM32
multiplatform kernel config.
