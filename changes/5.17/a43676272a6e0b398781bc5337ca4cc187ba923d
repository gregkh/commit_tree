RISC-V: Add BeagleV Starlight Beta device tree

Add initial device tree for the BeagleV Starlight Beta board. About 300
of these boards were sent out as part of a now cancelled BeagleBoard.org
project.

I2C timing data is based on the device tree in the vendor u-boot port.
Heartbeat LED added by Geert.
