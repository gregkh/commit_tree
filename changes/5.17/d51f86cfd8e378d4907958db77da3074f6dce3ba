powerpc/mm: Switch obsolete dssall to .long

The dssall ("Data Stream Stop All") instruction is obsolete altogether
with other Data Cache Instructions since ISA 2.03 (year 2006).

LLVM IAS does not support it but PPC970 seems to be using it.
This switches dssall to .long as there is no much point in fixing LLVM.
