arm64: atomics: lse: Dereference matching size

When building with -Warray-bounds, the following warning is generated:

This is due to the compiler seeing an unsigned long * cast against
something (atomic_t) that is int sized. Replace the cast with the
matching size cast. This results in no change in binary output.

Note that __ll_sc__cmpxchg_case_##name##sz already uses the same
constraint:

	[v] "+Q" (*(u##sz *)ptr

Which is why only the LSE form needs updating and not the
LL/SC form, so this change is unlikely to be problematic.
