lib/crypto: blake2s: move hmac construction into wireguard

Basically nobody should use blake2s in an HMAC construction; it already
has a keyed variant. But unfortunately for historical reasons, Noise,
used by WireGuard, uses HKDF quite strictly, which means we have to use
this. Because this really shouldn't be used by others, this commit moves
it into wireguard's noise.c locally, so that kernels that aren't using
WireGuard don't get this superfluous code baked in. On m68k systems,
this shaves off ~314 bytes.
