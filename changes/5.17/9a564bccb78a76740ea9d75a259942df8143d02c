af_key: add __GFP_ZERO flag for compose_sadb_supported in function pfkey_register

Add __GFP_ZERO flag for compose_sadb_supported in function pfkey_register
to initialize the buffer of supp_skb to fix a kernel-info-leak issue.
1) Function pfkey_register calls compose_sadb_supported to request
a sk_buff. 2) compose_sadb_supported calls alloc_sbk to allocate
a sk_buff, but it doesn't zero it. 3) If auth_len is greater 0, then
compose_sadb_supported treats the memory as a struct sadb_supported and
begins to initialize. But it just initializes the field sadb_supported_len
and field sadb_supported_exttype without field sadb_supported_reserved.
