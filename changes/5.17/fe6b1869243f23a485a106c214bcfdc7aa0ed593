binder: fix handling of error during copy

If a memory copy function fails to copy the whole buffer,
a positive integar with the remaining bytes is returned.
In binder_translate_fd_array() this can result in an fd being
skipped due to the failed copy, but the loop continues
processing fds since the early return condition expects a
negative integer on error.

Fix by returning "ret > 0 ? -EINVAL : ret" to handle this case.
