ASoC: SOF: Intel: TGL: set core_get/put ops

Set core_get/put() ops for TGL. When core_get()
is requested for a core, its ref_count is incremented
and the PM_CORE_ENABLE IPC sent to the firmware to
power up the core if the current ref_count is 1.
Conversely, the ref_count is decremented in core_put()
and an IPC is sent to the DSP to power off the core
if the ref_count is 0.
