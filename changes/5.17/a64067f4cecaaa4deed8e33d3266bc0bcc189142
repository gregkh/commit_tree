ASoC: simple-card: fix probe failure on platform component

A previous change to simple-card resulted in asoc_simple_parse_dai
attempting to retrieve the dai_name for platform components, which are
unlikely to have a valid DAI name. This caused simple-card to fail to
probe when using the xlnx_formatter_pcm as the platform component, since
it does not register any DAI components.

Since the dai_name is not used for platform components, just skip trying
to retrieve it for those.
