powerpc/atomics: Remove atomic_inc()/atomic_dec() and friends

Now that atomic_add() and atomic_sub() handle immediate operands,
atomic_inc() and atomic_dec() have no added value compared to the
generic fallback which calls atomic_add(1) and atomic_sub(1).

Also remove atomic_inc_not_zero() which fallsback to
atomic_add_unless() which itself fallsback to
atomic_fetch_add_unless() which now handles immediate operands.
