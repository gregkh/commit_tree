Bluetooth: hci_sync: Set Privacy Mode when updating the resolving list

This adds support for Set Privacy Mode when updating the resolving list
when HCI_CONN_FLAG_DEVICE_PRIVACY so the controller shall use Device
Mode for devices programmed in the resolving list, Device Mode is
actually required when the remote device are not able to use RPA as
otherwise the default mode is Network Privacy Mode in which only
allows RPAs thus the controller would filter out advertisement using
identity addresses for which there is an IRK.
