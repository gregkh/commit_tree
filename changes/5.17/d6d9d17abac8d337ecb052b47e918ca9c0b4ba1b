tty: tty_io: Switch to vmalloc() fallback in case of TTY_NO_WRITE_SPLIT

When TTY_NO_WRITE_SPLIT is set and 64 KiB chunks are used, allow
vmalloc() fallback. Supply __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL to make kmalloc()
preferable over vmalloc() since we may want a better performance.

Note, both current users copy data to another buffer anyway, so
the type of our allocation doesn't affect their expectations.
