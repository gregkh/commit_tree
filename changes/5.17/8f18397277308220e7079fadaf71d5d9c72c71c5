staging: r8188eu: remove rf_type from getTxPowerIndex88E()

pHalData->rf_type is always RF_1T1R. As a result the variable
path_nums is always set to 1 and the for loop is entered only
once with TxCount = 0. Also RF_PATH_A = 0. Remove the unneeded
check for pHalData->rf_type and resulting dead code from
getTxPowerIndex88E().
