ixgbe: xsk: change !netif_carrier_ok() handling in ixgbe_xmit_zc()

Commit c685c69fba71 ("ixgbe: don't do any AF_XDP zero-copy transmit if
netif is not OK") addressed the ring transient state when
MEM_TYPE_XSK_BUFF_POOL was being configured which in turn caused the
interface to through down/up. Maurice reported that when carrier is not
ok and xsk_pool is present on ring pair, ksoftirqd will consume 100% CPU
cycles due to the constant NAPI rescheduling as ixgbe_poll() states that
there is still some work to be done.

To fix this, do not set work_done to false for a !netif_carrier_ok().
