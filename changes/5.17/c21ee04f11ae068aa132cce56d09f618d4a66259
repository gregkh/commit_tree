powerpc/xive: Add a kernel parameter for StoreEOI

StoreEOI is activated by default on platforms supporting the feature
(POWER10) and will be used as soon as firmware advertises its
availability. The kernel parameter provides a way to deactivate its
use. It can be still be reactivated through debugfs.
