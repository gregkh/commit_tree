fbdev: fbmem: Fix the implicit type casting

In function do_fb_ioctl(), the "arg" is the type of unsigned long,
and in "case FBIOBLANK:" this argument is casted into an int before
passig to fb_blank(). In fb_blank(), the comparision
if (blank > FB_BLANK_POWERDOWN) would be bypass if the original
"arg" is a large number, which is possible because it comes from
the user input. Fix this by adding the check before the function
call.
