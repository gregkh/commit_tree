scsi: ufs: Wrap Universal Flash Storage drivers in SCSI_UFSHCD

The build only descends into drivers/scsi/ufs/ if SCSI_UFSHCD is enabled.
Hence all later config symbols should depend on SCSI_UFSHCD to prevent
asking the user about config symbols for driver code that won't be built
anyway.  Unfortunately not all symbols have that dependency.

Fix this by wrapping them all into a big if/endif block.  Remove the now
superfluous explicit dependencies on SCSI_UFSHCD from all symbols that
already had it.
