KVM: selftests: arm64: Add support for various modes with 16kB page size

The 16kB page size is not a popular choice, due to only a few CPUs
actually implementing support for it. However, it can lead to some
interesting performance improvements given the right uarch choices.

Add support for this page size for various PA/VA combinations.
