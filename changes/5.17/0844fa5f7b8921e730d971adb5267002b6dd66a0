net/mlx5: Let user configure io_eq_size param

Currently, each I/O EQ is taking 128KB of memory. This size
is not needed in all use cases, and is critical with large scale.
Hence, allow user to configure the size of I/O EQs.

For example, to reduce I/O EQ size to 64, execute:
$ devlink dev param set pci/0000:00:0b.0 name io_eq_size value 64 \
              cmode driverinit
$ devlink dev reload pci/0000:00:0b.0
