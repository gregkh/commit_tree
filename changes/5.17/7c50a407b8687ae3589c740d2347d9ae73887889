pinctrl: renesas: Remove unneeded locking around sh_pfc_read() calls

There is no need to acquire the spinlock when reading from a pin
controller register:
  1. Reading a single MMIO register is an atomic operation,
  2. While sh_pfc_phys_to_virt() inside sh_pfc_read() has to traverse
     all mapped windows to find the appropriate virtual address, this
     does not need any locking, as the window mappings are never
     changed.
