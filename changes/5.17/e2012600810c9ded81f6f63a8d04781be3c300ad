arm64: perf: Add userspace counter access disable switch

Like x86, some users may want to disable userspace PMU counter
altogether. Add a sysctl 'perf_user_access' file to control userspace
counter access. The default is '0' which is disabled. Writing '1'
enables access.

Note that x86 supports globally enabling user access by writing '2' to
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/rdpmc. As there's not existing
userspace support to worry about, this shouldn't be necessary for Arm.
It could be added later if the need arises.
