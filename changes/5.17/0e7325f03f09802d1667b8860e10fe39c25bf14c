device-dax: set mapping prior to vmf_insert_pfn{,_pmd,pud}()

Normally, the @page mapping is set prior to inserting the page into a
page table entry.  Make device-dax adhere to the same ordering, rather
than setting mapping after the PTE is inserted.

The address_space never changes and it is always associated with the
same inode and underlying pages.  So, the page mapping is set once but
cleared when the struct pages are removed/freed (i.e.  after
{devm_}memunmap_pages()).
