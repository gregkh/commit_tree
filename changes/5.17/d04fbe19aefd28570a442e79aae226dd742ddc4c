btrfs: scrub: cleanup the argument list of scrub_chunk()

The argument list of scrub_chunk() has the following problems:

- Duplicated @chunk_offset
  It is the same as btrfs_block_group::start.

- Confusing @length
  The most instinctive guess is chunk length, and one may want to delete
  it, but the truth is, it's the device extent length.

Fix this by:

- Remove @chunk_offset
  Use btrfs_block_group::start instead.

- Rename @length to @dev_extent_len
  Also rename the caller to remove the ambiguous naming.

- Rename @cache to @bg
  The "_cache" suffix for btrfs_block_group has been removed for a while.
