mtd: rawnand: omap2: Actually prevent invalid configuration and build error

The root of the problem is that we are selecting symbols that have
dependencies. This can cause random configurations that can fail.
The cleanest solution is to avoid using select.

This driver uses interfaces from the OMAP_GPMC driver so we have to
depend on it instead.
