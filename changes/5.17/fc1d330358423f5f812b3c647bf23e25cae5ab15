selftests/core: remove ARRAY_SIZE define from close_range_test.c

ARRAY_SIZE is defined in several selftests. Remove definitions from
individual test files and include header file for the define instead.
ARRAY_SIZE define is added in a separate patch to prepare for this
change.

Remove ARRAY_SIZE from close_range_test.c and pickup the one defined
in kselftest.h.
