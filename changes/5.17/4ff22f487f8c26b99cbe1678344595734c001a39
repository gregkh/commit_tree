drm: Return error codes from struct drm_driver.gem_create_object

GEM helper libraries use struct drm_driver.gem_create_object to let
drivers override GEM object allocation. On failure, the call returns
NULL.

Change the semantics to make the calls return a pointer-encoded error.
This aligns the callback with its callers. Fixes the ingenic driver,
which already returns an error pointer.

Also update the callers to handle the involved types more strictly.
