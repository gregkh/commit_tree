perf arm-spe: Add SPE total latency as PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT

Use total latency info in the SPE counter packet as sample weight so
that we can see it in local_weight and (global) weight sort keys.

Maybe we can use PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT to support ins_lat as well
but I'm not sure which latency it matches.  So just adding total latency
first.
