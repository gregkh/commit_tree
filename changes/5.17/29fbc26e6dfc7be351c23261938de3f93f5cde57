tcp: do not call tcp_cleanup_rbuf() if we have a backlog

Under pressure, tcp recvmsg() has logic to process the socket backlog,
but calls tcp_cleanup_rbuf() right before.

Avoiding sending ACK right before processing new segments makes
a lot of sense, as this decrease the number of ACK packets,
with no impact on effective ACK clocking.
