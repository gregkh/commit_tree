platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Make *_init() functions return -ENODEV instead of 1

Make ibm_init_struct.init() callbacks return -ENODEV instead of 1 when
the subdevice / function is not available.

Using -ENODEV clearly states what it going on where as a magic return of
"1" requires a deep dive into the code to figure out what is going on.

This also allows for some cleanups, avoiding the need to translate an
-ENODEV return into "return 1" (which often mistakenly was "return 0").
