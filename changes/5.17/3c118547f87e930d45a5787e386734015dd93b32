u64_stats: Disable preemption on 32bit UP+SMP PREEMPT_RT during updates.

On PREEMPT_RT the seqcount_t for synchronisation is required on 32bit
architectures even on UP because the softirq (and the threaded IRQ handler) can
be preempted.

With the seqcount_t for synchronisation, a reader with higher priority can
preempt the writer and then spin endlessly in read_seqcount_begin() while the
writer can't make progress.

To avoid such a lock up on PREEMPT_RT the writer must disable preemption during
the update. There is no need to disable interrupts because no writer is using
this API in hard-IRQ context on PREEMPT_RT.

Disable preemption on 32bit-RT within the u64_stats write section.
