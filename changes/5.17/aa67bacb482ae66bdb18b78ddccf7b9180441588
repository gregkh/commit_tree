arm: dts: mt6589: Add device tree for Fairphone 1

Add rudimentary support for the Fairphone 1, based on MT6589 to boot to
UART console.

The recently added SMP support needs to be disabled for this board as
the kernel panics executing /init with it, even though the CPUs seem to
start up fine - maybe a stability issue.
