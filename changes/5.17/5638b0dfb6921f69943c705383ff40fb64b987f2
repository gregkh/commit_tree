usb: typec: tcpci: don't touch CC line if it's Vconn source

With the AMS and Collision Avoidance, tcpm often needs to change the CC's
termination. When one CC line is sourcing Vconn, if we still change its
termination, the voltage of the another CC line is likely to be fluctuant
and unstable.

Therefore, we should verify whether a CC line is sourcing Vconn before
changing its termination and only change the termination that is not
a Vconn line. This can be done by reading the Vconn Present bit of
POWER_ STATUS register. To determine the polarity, we can read the
Plug Orientation bit of TCPC_CONTROL register. Since Vconn can only be
sourced if Plug Orientation is set.
