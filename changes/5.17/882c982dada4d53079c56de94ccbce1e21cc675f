acpi: Store CRC-32 hash of the _PLD in struct acpi_device

Storing CRC-32 hash of the Physical Location of Device
object (_PLD) with devices that have it. The hash is stored
to a new struct acpi_device member "pld_crc".

The hash makes it easier to find devices that share a
location, as there is no need to evaluate the entire object
every time. Knowledge about devices that share a location
can be used in device drivers that need to know the
connections to other components inside a system. USB3 ports
will for example always share their location with a USB2
port.
