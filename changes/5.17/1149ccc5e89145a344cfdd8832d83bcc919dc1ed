ARM: dts: stm32: fix stusb1600 pinctrl used on stm32mp157c-dk

A pinctrl handle is used to setup a pull-up on the stusb1600 IRQ pin (that
is open drain).
When in ANALOG state, no pull-up can be applied in the GPIO HW controller,
still the setting is done into the register. The pull-up is effective
currently, only when the GPIO IRQ is requested. The correct setting is to
use directly the GPIO, instead of ANALOG state.
