dmaengine: idxd: create locked version of idxd_quiesce() call

Add a locked version of idxd_quiesce() call so that the quiesce can be
called with a lock in situations where the lock is not held by the caller.

In the driver probe/remove path, the lock is already held, so the raw
version can be called w/o locking.
