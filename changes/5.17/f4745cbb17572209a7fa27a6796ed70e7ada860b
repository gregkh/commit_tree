iwlwifi: mvm: perform 6GHz passive scan after suspend

The 6GHz passive scan is performed only once every 50 minutes.
However, in case of suspend/resume, the regulatory information
is reset, so 6GHz channels may become disabled.
Fix it by performing a 6GHz passive scan within 60 seconds after
suspend/resume even if the 50 minutes timeout did not expire yet.
