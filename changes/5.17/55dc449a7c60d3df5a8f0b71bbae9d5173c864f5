drm/ast: Handle failed I2C initialization gracefully

I2C initialization is allowed to fail. In this case, create a connector
without DDC adapter. The current code would dereference a NULL pointer.

Reading the modes from the connector is supposed to work without I2C
adapter. Add the respective test.

v2:
	* init edid to NULL to avoid uninitialized read (Dan)
