dt-bindings: clock: samsung: extend Exynos7 bindings with UFS

The UFS for Exynos7 SoC clock controller requires additional input
clocks for the FSYS1 clock controller.  Update the bindings to reflect
this, at least in theory.  In practice, these input clocks are ignored,
so it is rather adjusting of bindings to existing DTS, without affecting
any real users.  I understand that is not how it should be done,
though...
