KVM: selftests: aarch64: Level-sensitive interrupts tests in vgic_irq

Add a cmdline arg for using level-sensitive interrupts (vs the default
edge-triggered). Then move the handler into a generic handler function
that takes the type of interrupt (level vs. edge) as an arg.  When
handling line-sensitive interrupts it sets the line to low after
acknowledging the IRQ.
