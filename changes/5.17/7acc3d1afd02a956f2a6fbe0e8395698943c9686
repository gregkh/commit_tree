erofs: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare
having a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure.

Kernel code should always use `flexible array members' [1] for these
cases. The older style of one-element or zero-length arrays should
no longer be used [2].
