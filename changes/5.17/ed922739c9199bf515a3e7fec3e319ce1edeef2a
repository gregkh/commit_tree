KVM: Use interval tree to do fast hva lookup in memslots

The current memslots implementation only allows quick binary search by gfn,
quick lookup by hva is not possible - the implementation has to do a linear
scan of the whole memslots array, even though the operation being performed
might apply just to a single memslot.

This significantly hurts performance of per-hva operations with higher
memslot counts.

Since hva ranges can overlap between memslots an interval tree is needed
for tracking them.
