selftests/bpf: Enable cross-building with clang

Cross building using clang requires passing the "-target" flag rather
than using the CROSS_COMPILE prefix. Makefile.include transforms
CROSS_COMPILE into CLANG_CROSS_FLAGS. Clear CROSS_COMPILE for bpftool
and the host libbpf, and use the clang flags for urandom_read and bench.
