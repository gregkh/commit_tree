Bluetooth: Fix handling of SUSPEND_DISCONNECTING

When SUSPEND_DISCONNECTING bit is set that means Disconnect is pending
but the code was evaluating if the list is empty before calling
hci_conn_del which does the actual cleanup and remove the connection
from the list thus the bit is never cleared causing the suspend
procedure to always timeout when there are connections to be
disconnected:
