tcp: avoid indirect calls to sock_rfree

TCP uses sk_eat_skb() when skbs can be removed from receive queue.
However, the call to skb_orphan() from __kfree_skb() incurs
an indirect call so sock_rfee(), which is more expensive than
a direct call, especially for CONFIG_RETPOLINE=y.

Add tcp_eat_recv_skb() function to make the call before
__kfree_skb().
