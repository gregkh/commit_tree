hugetlbfs: fix off-by-one error in hugetlb_vmdelete_list()

Pass "end - 1" instead of "end" when walking the interval tree in
hugetlb_vmdelete_list() to fix an inclusive vs.  exclusive bug.  The two
callers that pass a non-zero "end" treat it as exclusive, whereas the
interval tree iterator expects an inclusive "last".  E.g.  punching a
hole in a file that precisely matches the size of a single hugepage,
with a vma starting right on the boundary, will result in
unmap_hugepage_range() being called twice, with the second call having
start==end.

The off-by-one error doesn't cause functional problems as
__unmap_hugepage_range() turns into a massive nop due to
short-circuiting its for-loop on "address < end".  But, the mmu_notifier
invocations to invalid_range_{start,end}() are passed a bogus zero-sized
range, which may be unexpected behavior for secondary MMUs.

The bug was exposed by commit ed922739c919 ("KVM: Use interval tree to
do fast hva lookup in memslots"), currently queued in the KVM tree for
5.17, which added a WARN to detect ranges with start==end.
