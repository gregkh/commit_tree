Revert "perf powerpc: Add encodings to represent data based on newer composite PERF_MEM_LVLNUM* fields"

This was in a patchkit mixing up kernel with tools/ parts and I
mistakenly got it merged in the perf tools tree, revert it, it'll go via
the PowerPC kernel tree.

This reverts commit 0ebce3d65f1f53c936fdd51e975bd876ba7ed64f.
