perf: Add new macros for mem_hops field

Add new macros for mem_hops field which can be used to
represent remote-node, socket and board level details.

Currently the code had macro for HOPS_0, which corresponds
to data coming from another core but same node.
Add new macros for HOPS_1 to HOPS_3 to represent
remote-node, socket and board level data.

For ex: Encodings for mem_hops fields with L2 cache:

L2			- local L2
L2 | REMOTE | HOPS_0	- remote core, same node L2
L2 | REMOTE | HOPS_1	- remote node, same socket L2
L2 | REMOTE | HOPS_2	- remote socket, same board L2
L2 | REMOTE | HOPS_3	- remote board L2
