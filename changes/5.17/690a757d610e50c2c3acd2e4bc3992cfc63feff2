kvm: x86: Add CPUID support for Intel AMX

Extend CPUID emulation to support XFD, AMX_TILE, AMX_INT8 and
AMX_BF16. Adding those bits into kvm_cpu_caps finally activates all
previous logics in this series.

Hide XFD on 32bit host kernels. Otherwise it leads to a weird situation
where KVM tells userspace to migrate MSR_IA32_XFD and then rejects
attempts to read/write the MSR.
