drm/i915/dg2: s/DISP_STEPPING/DISPLAY_STEPPING/

Commit cd0fcf5af791 ("drm/i915: rename DISP_STEPPING->DISPLAY_STEP and
GT_STEPPING->GT_STEP") renamed all platforms' display stepping tests,
but the DG2 patches were still in-flight at that time and did not
incorporate the new naming scheme.  Rename DG2's macro now for
consistency with other platforms.
