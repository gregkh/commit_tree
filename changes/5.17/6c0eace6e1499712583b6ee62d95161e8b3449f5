random: access input_pool_data directly rather than through pointer

This gets rid of another abstraction we no longer need. It would be nice
if we could instead make pool an array rather than a pointer, but the
latent entropy plugin won't be able to do its magic in that case. So
instead we put all accesses to the input pool's actual data through the
input_pool_data array directly.
