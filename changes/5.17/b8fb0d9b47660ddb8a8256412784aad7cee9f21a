platform/x86: amd-pmc: Correct usage of SMU version

Yellow carp has been outputting versions like `1093.24.0`, but this
is supposed to be 69.24.0. That is the MSB is being interpreted
incorrectly.

The MSB is not part of the major version, but has generally been
treated that way thus far.  It's actually the program, and used to
distinguish between two programs from a similar family but different
codebase.
