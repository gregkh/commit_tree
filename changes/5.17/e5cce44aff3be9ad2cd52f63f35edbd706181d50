IB/hfi1: Fix tstats alloc and dealloc

The tstats allocation is done in the accelerated ndo_init function but the
allocation is not tested to succeed.

The deallocation is not done in the accelerated ndo_uninit function.

Resolve issues by testing for an allocation failure and adding the
free_percpu in the uninit function.
