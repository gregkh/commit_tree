habanalabs: rename late init after reset function

The ASIC-specific soft_reset_late_init() is now called after either
soft-reset or reset-upon-device-release. Therefore, it needs a more
appropriate name.

No need to split it to two functions, as an ASIC either supports
soft-reset or reset-upon-device-release.
