perf: Force architectures to opt-in to guest callbacks

Introduce GUEST_PERF_EVENTS and require architectures to select it to
allow registering and using guest callbacks in perf.  This will hopefully
make it more difficult for new architectures to add useless "support" for
guest callbacks, e.g. via copy+paste.

Stubbing out the helpers has the happy bonus of avoiding a load of
perf_guest_cbs when GUEST_PERF_EVENTS=n on arm64/x86.
