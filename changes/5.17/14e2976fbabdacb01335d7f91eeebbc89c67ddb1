regulator: qcom_smd: Align probe function with rpmh-regulator

The RPMh regulator driver is much newer and gets more attention, which in
consequence makes it do a few things better. Update qcom_smd-regulator's
probe function to mimic what rpmh-regulator does to address a couple of
issues:

- Probe defer now works correctly, before it used to, well,
  kinda just die.. This fixes reliable probing on (at least) PM8994,
  because Linux apparently cannot deal with supply map dependencies yet..

- Regulator data is now matched more sanely: regulator data is matched
  against each individual regulator node name and throwing an -EINVAL if
  data is missing, instead of just assuming everything is fine and
  iterating over all subsequent array members.

- status = "disabled" will now work for disabling individual regulators in
  DT. Previously it didn't seem to do much if anything at all.
