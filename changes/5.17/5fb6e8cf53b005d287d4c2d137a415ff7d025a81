locking/atomic: atomic64: Remove unusable atomic ops

The generic atomic64 implementation provides:

* atomic64_and_return()
* atomic64_or_return()
* atomic64_xor_return()

... but none of these exist in the standard atomic64 API as described by
scripts/atomic/atomics.tbl, and none of these have prototypes exposed by
<asm-generic/atomic64.h>.

The lkp kernel test robot noted this results in warnings when building with
W=1:

  lib/atomic64.c:82:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'generic_atomic64_and_return' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

  lib/atomic64.c:82:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'generic_atomic64_or_return' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

  lib/atomic64.c:82:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'generic_atomic64_xor_return' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

This appears to have been a thinko in commit:

  28aa2bda2211f432 ("locking/atomic: Implement atomic{,64,_long}_fetch_{add,sub,and,andnot,or,xor}{,_relaxed,_acquire,_release}()")

... where we grouped add/sub separately from and/ox/xor, so that we could avoid
implementing _return forms for the latter group, but forgot to remove
ATOMIC64_OP_RETURN() for that group.

This doesn't cause any functional problem, but it's pointless to build code
which cannot be used. Remove the unusable code. This does not affect add/sub,
for which _return forms will still be built.
