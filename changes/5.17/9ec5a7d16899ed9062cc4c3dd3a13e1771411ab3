tracing: Change event_command func() to parse()

The name of the func() callback on event_command is too generic and is
easily confused with other callbacks with that name, so change it to
something that reflects its actual purpose.

In this case, the main purpose of the callback is to parse an event
command, so call it parse() instead.
