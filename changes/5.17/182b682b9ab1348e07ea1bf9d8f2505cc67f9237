ASoC: SOF: ipc: Add null pointer check for substream->runtime

When pcm stream is stopped "substream->runtime" pointer will be set
to NULL by ALSA core. In case host received an ipc msg from firmware
of type IPC_STREAM_POSITION after pcm stream is stopped, there will
be kernel NULL pointer exception in ipc_period_elapsed(). This patch
fixes it by adding NULL pointer check for "substream->runtime".
