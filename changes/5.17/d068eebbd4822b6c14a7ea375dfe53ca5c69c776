cgroup/cpuset: Make child cpusets restrict parents on v1 hierarchy

The commit 1f1562fcd04a ("cgroup/cpuset: Don't let child cpusets
restrict parent in default hierarchy") inteded to relax the check only
on the default hierarchy (or v2 mode) but it dropped the check in v1
too.

This patch returns and separates the legacy-only validations so that
they can be considered only in the v1 mode, which should enforce the old
constraints for the sake of compatibility.
