net: hns3: fix hns3 driver header file not self-contained issue

The hns3 driver header file uses the structure of other files, but does
not include corresponding file, which causes a check warning that the
header file is not self-contained.

Therefore, the required header file is included in the header file, and
the structure declaration is added to the header file to avoid cyclic
dependency of the header file.
