KVM: VMX: Introduce vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed() helper

In preparation to enabling 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' feature for Hyper-V
guests move MSR bitmap update tracking to a dedicated helper.

Note: vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed() is called when MSR bitmap might be
updated. KVM doesn't check if the bit we're trying to set is already set
(or the bit it's trying to clear is already cleared). Such situations
should not be common and a few false positives should not be a problem.

No functional change intended.
