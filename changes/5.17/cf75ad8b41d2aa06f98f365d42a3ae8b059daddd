Bluetooth: hci_sync: Convert MGMT_SET_POWERED

This make use of hci_cmd_sync_queue when MGMT_SET_POWERED is used so all
commands are run within hdev->cmd_sync_work instead of
hdev->power_on_work and hdev->power_off_work.

In addition to that the power on sequence now takes into account if
local IRK needs to be programmed in the resolving list.

Tested with:

tools/mgmt-tester -s "Set powered"
