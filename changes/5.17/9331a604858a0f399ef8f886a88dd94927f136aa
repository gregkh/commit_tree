kselftest/arm64: Allow signal tests to trigger from a function

Currently we have the facility to specify custom code to trigger a signal
but none of the tests use it and for some reason the framework requires us
to also specify a signal to send as a trigger in order to make use of a
custom trigger. This doesn't seem to make much sense, instead allow the
use of a custom trigger function without specifying a signal to inject.
