ASoC: soc-pcm: align BE 'atomicity' with that of the FE

Since the flow for DPCM is based on taking a lock for the FE first, we
need to make sure during the connection between a BE and an FE that
they both use the same 'atomicity', otherwise we may sleep in atomic
context.

If the FE is nonatomic, this patch forces the BE to be nonatomic as
well. That should have no negative impact since the BE 'inherits' the
FE properties.

However, if the FE is atomic and the BE is not, then the configuration
is flagged as invalid.
