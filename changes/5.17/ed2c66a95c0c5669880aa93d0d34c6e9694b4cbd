arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3399-puma-haikou USB OTG mode

The micro USB3.0 port available on the Haikou evaluation kit for Puma
RK3399-Q7 SoM supports dual-role model (aka drd or OTG) but its support
was broken until now because of missing logic around the ID pin.

This adds proper support for USB OTG on Puma Haikou by "connecting" the
GPIO used for USB ID to the USB3 controller device.
