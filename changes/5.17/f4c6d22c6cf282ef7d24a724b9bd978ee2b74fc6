mm/damon: remove a mistakenly added comment for a future feature

Due to a mistake in patches reordering, a comment for a future feature
called 'arbitrary monitoring target support'[1], which is still under
development, has added.  Because it only introduces confusion and we
don't have a plan to post the patches soon, this commit removes the
mistakenly added part.
