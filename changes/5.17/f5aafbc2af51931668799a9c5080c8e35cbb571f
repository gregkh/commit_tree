libbpf: Deprecate bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear

As part of the road to libbpf 1.0, and discussed in libbpf issue tracker
[0], bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear and its associated structs and
helper functions should be deprecated. The functionality is too specific
to the needs of 'perf', and there's little/no out-of-tree usage to
preclude introduction of a more general helper in the future.
