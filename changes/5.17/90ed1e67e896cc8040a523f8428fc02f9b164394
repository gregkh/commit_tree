random: rather than entropy_store abstraction, use global

Originally, the RNG used several pools, so having things abstracted out
over a generic entropy_store object made sense. These days, there's only
one input pool, and then an uneven mix of usage via the abstraction and
usage via &input_pool. Rather than this uneasy mixture, just get rid of
the abstraction entirely and have things always use the global. This
simplifies the code and makes reading it a bit easier.
