hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Drop read_uv() depend on OF and IIO

The only possible assignment of a function to get a voltage to
convert to a resistance is to use the internal function
ntc_adc_iio_read() which is only available when using IIO
and OF.

Bite the bullet and mandate OF and IIO, drop the read_uv()
callback abstraction and some ifdefs.

As no board is using the platform data, all users are using
OF and IIO anyway.
