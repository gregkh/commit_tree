sched/fair: Document the slow path and fast path in select_task_rq_fair

All People I know including myself took a long time to figure out that
typical wakeup will always go to fast path and never go to slow path
except WF_FORK and WF_EXEC.

Vincent reminded me once in a linaro meeting and made me understand
slow path won't happen for WF_TTWU. But my other friends repeatedly
wasted a lot of time on testing this path like me before I reminded
them.

So obviously the code needs some document.
