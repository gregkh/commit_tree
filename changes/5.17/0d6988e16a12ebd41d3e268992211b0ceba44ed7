libbpf: Fix section counting logic

e_shnum does include section #0 and as such is exactly the number of ELF
sections that we need to allocate memory for to use section indices as
array indices. Fix the off-by-one error.

This is purely accounting fix, previously we were overallocating one
too many array items. But no correctness errors otherwise.
