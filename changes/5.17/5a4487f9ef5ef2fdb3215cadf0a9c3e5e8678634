perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add IMC uncore support for ADL

Current ADL uncore code only supports the legacy IMC (memory controller)
free-running counters. Besides the free-running counters, ADL also
supports several general purpose-counters.

The general-purpose counters can also be accessed via MMIO but in a
different location. Factor out __uncore_imc_init_box() with offset as a
parameter. The function can be shared between ADL and TGL.

The event format and the layout of the control registers are a little
bit different from other uncore counters.

The intel_generic_uncore_mmio_enable_event() can be shared with client
IMC uncore. Expose the function.

Add more PCI IDs for ADL machines.
