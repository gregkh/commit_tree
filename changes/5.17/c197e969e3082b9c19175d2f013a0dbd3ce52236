platform/surface: Reinstate platform dependency

Microsoft Surface platform-specific devices are only present on
Microsoft Surface platforms, which are currently limited to arm64 and
x86.  Hence add a dependency on ARM64 || X86, to prevent asking the user
about drivers for these devices when configuring a kernel for an
architecture that does not support Microsoft Surface platforms.
