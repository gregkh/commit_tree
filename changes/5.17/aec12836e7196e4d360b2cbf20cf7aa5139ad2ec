net: phy: marvell: Fix MDI-x polarity setting in 88e1118-compatible PHYs

When setting up autonegotiation for 88E1118R and compatible PHYs,
a software reset of PHY is issued before setting up polarity.
This is incorrect as changes of MDI Crossover Mode bits are
disruptive to the normal operation and must be followed by a
software reset to take effect. Let's patch m88e1118_config_aneg()
to fix the issue mentioned before by invoking software reset
of the PHY just after setting up MDI-x polarity.
