mm/thp: drop unused trace events hugepage_[invalidate|splitting]

The trace events hugepage_[invalidate|splitting], were added via the
commit 9e813308a5c1 ("powerpc/thp: Add tracepoints to track hugepage
invalidate").  Afterwards their call sites i.e
trace_hugepage_[invalidate|splitting] were just dropped off, leaving
these trace points unused.
