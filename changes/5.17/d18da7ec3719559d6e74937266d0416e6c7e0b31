selftests/zram01.sh: Fix compression ratio calculation

zram01 uses `free -m` to measure zram memory usage. The results are no
sense because they are polluted by all running processes on the system.

We Should only calculate the free memory delta for the current process.
So use the third field of /sys/block/zram<id>/mm_stat to measure memory
usage instead. The file is available since kernel 4.1.

orig_data_size(first): uncompressed size of data stored in this disk.
compr_data_size(second): compressed size of data stored in this disk
mem_used_total(third): the amount of memory allocated for this disk

Also remove useless zram cleanup call in zram_fill_fs and so we don't
need to cleanup zram twice if fails.
