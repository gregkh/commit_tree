RISC-V: defconfigs: Remove redundant CONFIG_POWER_RESET

As of ab7fbad0c7d7 ("riscv: Fix unmet direct dependencies built based on
SOC_VIRT") we select CONFIG_POWER_RESET=y along with CONFIG_SOC_VIRT,
which is already in defconfig.  This make setting CONFIG_POWER_RESET in
the defconfigs redundant, so remove it to remain consistent with
savedefconfig.
