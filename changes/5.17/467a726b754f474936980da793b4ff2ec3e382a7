cgroup-v1: Correct privileges check in release_agent writes

The idea is to check: a) the owning user_ns of cgroup_ns, b)
capabilities in init_user_ns.

The commit 24f600856418 ("cgroup-v1: Require capabilities to set
release_agent") got this wrong in the write handler of release_agent
since it checked user_ns of the opener (may be different from the owning
user_ns of cgroup_ns).
Secondly, to avoid possibly confused deputy, the capability of the
opener must be checked.
