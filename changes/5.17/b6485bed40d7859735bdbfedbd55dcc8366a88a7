drm/amdkfd: reset queue which consumes RAS poison (v2)

CP supports unmap queue with reset mode which only destroys specific queue without affecting others.
Replacing whole gpu reset with reset queue mode for RAS poison consumption
saves much time, and we can also fallback to gpu reset solution if reset
queue fails.

v2: Return directly if process is NULL;
    Reset queue solution is not applicable to SDMA, fallback to legacy
way;
    Call kfd_unref_process after lookup process.
