mm: move anon_vma declarations to linux/mm_inline.h

The patch to add anonymous vma names causes a build failure in some
configurations:

  include/linux/mm_types.h: In function 'is_same_vma_anon_name':
  include/linux/mm_types.h:924:37: error: implicit declaration of function 'strcmp' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    924 |         return name && vma_name && !strcmp(name, vma_name);
        |                                     ^~~~~~
  include/linux/mm_types.h:22:1: note: 'strcmp' is defined in header '<string.h>'; did you forget to '#include <string.h>'?

This should not really be part of linux/mm_types.h in the first place,
as that header is meant to only contain structure defintions and need a
minimum set of indirect includes itself.

While the header clearly includes more than it should at this point,
let's not make it worse by including string.h as well, which would pull
in the expensive (compile-speed wise) fortify-string logic.

Move the new functions into a separate header that only needs to be
included in a couple of locations.
