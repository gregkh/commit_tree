ACPI: tables: Quiet ACPI table not found warning

Paul reports that the ACPI core complains on every boot about a missing
CEDT table. Unlike the standard NUMA tables (SRAT, MADT, and SLIT) that
are critical to NUMA init, CEDT is only expected on CXL platforms. Given
the notice is not actionable lower its severity to debug.
