MAINTAINERS: add myself as co-maintainer for Realtek DSA switch drivers

Adding myself (Alvin Šipraga) as another maintainer for the Realtek DSA
switch drivers. I intend to help Linus out with reviewing and testing
changes to these drivers, particularly the rtl8365mb driver which I
authored and have hardware access to.
