i2c: exynos5: Add support for ExynosAutoV9 SoC

ExynosAutoV9 functioning logic mostly follows I2C_TYPE_EXYNOS7, but
timing calculation and configuration procedure is changed: e.g. only
timing_s3 has to be set now.

Another change of HSI2C controller in ExynosAutoV9 SoC is that it's now
a part of USIv2 IP-core. No changes is needed for I2C driver though, as
all USI related configuration is done in USI driver.
