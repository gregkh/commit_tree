iwlwifi: mvm: always store the PPAG table as the latest version.

In case of a conflict between BIOS version and FW
version of the PPAG table - the values arrive in the FW in the wrong
places. This happens because we're storing the table in different
structures depending on the BIOS version, not on the FW version,
and so the FW doesn't get what it expect to.
Always store the table in a v2 structure (which is a superset
of v1 and v0).

Also store the table in a structured way and in it's own structure,
rather then storing it in the ppag command structure, similarly to
the WRDS, EWRD and WGDS tables.
