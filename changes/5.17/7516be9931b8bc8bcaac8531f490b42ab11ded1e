find: micro-optimize for_each_{set,clear}_bit()

The macros iterate thru all set/clear bits in a bitmap. They search a
first bit using find_first_bit(), and the rest bits using find_next_bit().

Since find_next_bit() is called shortly after find_first_bit(), we can
save few lines of I-cache by not using find_first_bit().
