drm/panel: Delete panel on mipi_dsi_attach() failure

Many DSI panel drivers fail to clean up their panel references on
mipi_dsi_attach() failure, so we're leaving a dangling drm_panel
reference to freed memory. Clean that up on failure.

Noticed by inspection, after seeing similar problems on other drivers.
Therefore, I'm not marking Fixes/stable.
