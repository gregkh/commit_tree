erofs: support inline data decompression

Currently, we have already support tail-packing inline for
uncompressed file, let's also implement this for compressed
files to save I/Os and storage space.

Different from normal pclusters, compressed data is available
in advance because of other metadata I/Os. Therefore, they
directly move into the bypass queue without extra I/O submission.

It's the last compression feature before folio/subpage support.
