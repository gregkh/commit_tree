driver core: Move driver_sysfs_remove() after driver_sysfs_add()

The driver_sysfs_remove() should be called after driver_sysfs_add() in
really_probe(). The out-of-order driver_sysfs_remove() tries to remove
some nonexistent nodes under the device and driver sysfs nodes. This is
allowed, hence this change doesn't fix any problem, just a cleanup.
