riscv: fix build with binutils 2.38

From version 2.38, binutils default to ISA spec version 20191213. This
means that the csr read/write (csrr*/csrw*) instructions and fence.i
instruction has separated from the `I` extension, become two standalone
extensions: Zicsr and Zifencei. As the kernel uses those instruction,
this causes the following build failure:

  CC      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vgettimeofday.o
  <<BUILDDIR>>/arch/riscv/include/asm/vdso/gettimeofday.h: Assembler messages:
  <<BUILDDIR>>/arch/riscv/include/asm/vdso/gettimeofday.h:71: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrr a5,0xc01'
  <<BUILDDIR>>/arch/riscv/include/asm/vdso/gettimeofday.h:71: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrr a5,0xc01'
  <<BUILDDIR>>/arch/riscv/include/asm/vdso/gettimeofday.h:71: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrr a5,0xc01'
  <<BUILDDIR>>/arch/riscv/include/asm/vdso/gettimeofday.h:71: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrr a5,0xc01'

The fix is to specify those extensions explicitely in -march. However as
older binutils version do not support this, we first need to detect
that.
