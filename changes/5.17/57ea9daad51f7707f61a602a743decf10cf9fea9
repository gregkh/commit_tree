memory: renesas-rpc-if: avoid use of undocumented bits

Instead of writing fixed values with undocumented bits which happen to
be set on some SoCs, better switch to read-modify-write operations
changing only bits which are documented. This is way more future-proof
as we don't know yet how these bits may be on upcoming SoCs.
