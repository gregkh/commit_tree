perf/arm-cmn: Streamline node iteration

Refactor the places where we scan through the set of nodes to switch
from explicit array indexing to pointer-based iteration. This leads to
slightly simpler object code, but also makes the source less dense and
more pleasant for further development. It also unearths an almost-bug
in arm_cmn_event_init() where we've been depending on the "array index"
of NULL relative to cmn->dns being a sufficiently large number, yuck.
