ARM: dts: Fix timer regression for beagleboard revision c

Commit e428e250fde6 ("ARM: dts: Configure system timers for omap3")
caused a timer regression for beagleboard revision c where the system
clockevent stops working if omap3isp module is unloaded.

Turns out we still have beagleboard revisions a-b4 capacitor c70 quirks
applied that limit the usable timers for no good reason. This also affects
the power management as we use the system clock instead of the 32k clock
source.

Let's fix the issue by adding a new omap3-beagle-ab4.dts for the old timer
quirks. This allows us to remove the timer quirks for later beagleboard
revisions. We also need to update the related timer quirk check for the
correct compatible property.
