gpiolib: provide gpiod_remove_hogs()

Currently all users of gpiod_add_hogs() call it only once at system
init so there never was any need for a mechanism allowing to remove
them. Now the upcoming gpio-sim will need to tear down chips with hogged
lines so provide a function that allows to remove hogs.
