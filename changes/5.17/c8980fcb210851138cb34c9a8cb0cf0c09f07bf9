xen/x2apic: enable x2apic mode when supported for HVM

There's no point in disabling x2APIC mode when running as a Xen HVM
guest, just enable it when available.

Remove some unneeded wrapping around the detection functions, and
simply provide a xen_x2apic_available helper that's a wrapper around
x2apic_supported.
