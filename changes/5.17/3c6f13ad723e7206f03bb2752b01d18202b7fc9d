drm/i915/adlp: Fix TypeC PHY-ready status readout

The TCSS_DDI_STATUS register is indexed by tc_port not by the FIA port
index, fix this up. This only caused an issue on TC#3/4 ports in legacy
mode, as in all other cases the two indices either match (on TC#1/2) or
the TCSS_DDI_STATUS_READY flag is set regardless of something being
connected or not (on TC#1/2/3/4 in dp-alt and tbt-alt modes).
