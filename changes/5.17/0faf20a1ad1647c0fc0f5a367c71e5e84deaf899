powerpc/64s/interrupt: Don't enable MSR[EE] in irq handlers unless perf is in use

Enabling MSR[EE] in interrupt handlers while interrupts are still soft
masked allows PMIs to profile interrupt handlers to some degree, beyond
what SIAR latching allows.

When perf is not being used, this is almost useless work. It requires an
extra mtmsrd in the irq handler, and it also opens the door to masked
interrupts hitting and requiring replay, which is more expensive than
just taking them directly. This effect can be noticable in high IRQ
workloads.

Avoid enabling MSR[EE] unless perf is currently in use. This saves about
60 cycles (or 8%) on a simple decrementer interrupt microbenchmark.
Replayed interrupts drop from 1.4% of all interrupts taken, to 0.003%.

This does prevent the soft-nmi interrupt being taken in these handlers,
but that's not too reliable anyway. The SMP watchdog will continue to be
the reliable way to catch lockups.
