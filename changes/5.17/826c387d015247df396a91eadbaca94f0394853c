drm/vmwgfx: Remove the deprecated lower mem limit

TTM during the transition to the new page allocator lost the ability
to constrain the allocations via the lower_mem_limit. The code has
been unused since the change:
256dd44bd897 ("drm/ttm: nuke old page allocator")
and there's no reason to keep it.
