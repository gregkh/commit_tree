cxl/core: Convert to EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS_GPL

It turns out that the usb example of specifying the subsystem namespace
at build time is not preferred. The rationale for that preference has
become more apparent as CXL patches with plain EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL beg the
question, "why would any code other than CXL care about this symbol?".
Make the namespace explicit.
