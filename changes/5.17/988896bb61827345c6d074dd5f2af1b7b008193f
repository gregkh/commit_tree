x86/kvm/fpu: Remove kvm_vcpu_arch.guest_supported_xcr0

kvm_vcpu_arch currently contains the guest supported features in both
guest_supported_xcr0 and guest_fpu.fpstate->user_xfeatures field.

Currently both fields are set to the same value in
kvm_vcpu_after_set_cpuid() and are not changed anywhere else after that.

Since it's not good to keep duplicated data, remove guest_supported_xcr0.

To keep the code more readable, introduce kvm_guest_supported_xcr()
and kvm_guest_supported_xfd() to replace the previous usages of
guest_supported_xcr0.
