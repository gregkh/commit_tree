platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Remove the Glavey TM800A550L entry

The Glavey TM800A550L tablet is a tablet which ships with Android as
factory OS. As such it has the typical broken DSDT which x86 Android
tablets tend to have.

Specifically the touchscreen ACPI device node is missing the IRQ for
the touchscreen. So far users were expected to fix this with a DSDT
overlay, but support for the TM800A550L has been added to the new
x86-android-modules kernel-module and that will now automatically
instantiate a proper i2c-client with the IRQ set for the touchscreen,
including the necessary device-properties for the firmware loading.

This means that the touchscreen_dmi entry for the TM800A550L is
no longer necessary (and it no longer matches either since the
touchscreen is no longer enumerated through ACPI), remove it.
