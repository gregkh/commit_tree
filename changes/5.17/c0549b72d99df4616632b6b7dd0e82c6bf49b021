platform/x86: lenovo-yogabook-wmi: Add driver for Lenovo Yoga Book

Add driver to handle WMI events, control the keyboard backlight and
bind/unbind the keyboard-touch / digitizer driver so that only one
is active at a time.

It may seem a bit weird to handle the toggling of the modes in the
kernel, but the hw actually expects only 1 device to be active
at a time.

Changes by Hans de Goede:
- Whole bunch of cleanups
- Make the kernel do the driver bind/unbind itself instead of
  sending events to userspace and requiring a special userspace
  daemon to deal with this
