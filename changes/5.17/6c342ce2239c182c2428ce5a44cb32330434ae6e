mctp: serial: Cancel pending work from ndo_uninit handler

We cannot do the cancel_work_sync from after the unregister_netdev, as
the dev pointer is no longer valid, causing a uaf on ldisc unregister
(or device close).

Instead, do the cancel_work_sync from the ndo_uninit op, where the dev
still exists, but the queue has stopped.
