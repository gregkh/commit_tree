ACPI: scan: Change acpi_scan_init() return value type to void

The only caller of acpi_scan_init(), acpi_init(), doesn't check its
return value, so turn it into a void function.

This avoids complaints from the Smatch static checker that the
function should return a negative error code when it fails, which
is not really a problem in this particular case.

No intentional functional impact.
