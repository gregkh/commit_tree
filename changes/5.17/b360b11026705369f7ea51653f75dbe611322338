mmc: core: allow to match the device tree to apply quirks

MMC subsystem provides a way to apply quirks when a device match some
properties (VID, PID, etc...) Unfortunately, some SDIO devices do not
comply with the SDIO specification and does not provide reliable VID/PID
(eg. Silabs WF200).

So, the drivers for these devices rely on device tree to identify the
device.

This patch allows the MMC to also rely on the device tree to apply a
quirk.
