rtla/hist: Make -E the short version of --entries

Currently, --entries uses -e as the short version in the hist mode of
timerlat and osnoise tools. But as -e is already used to enable events
on trace sessions by other tools, thus let's keep it available for the
same usage for all rtla tools.

Make -E the short version of --entries for hist mode on all tools.

Note: rtla was merged in this merge window, so rtla was not released yet.
