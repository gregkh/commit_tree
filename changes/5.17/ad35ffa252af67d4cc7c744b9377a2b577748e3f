ice: Fix curr_link_speed advertised speed

Change curr_link_speed advertised speed, due to
link_info.link_speed is not equal phy.curr_user_speed_req.
Without this patch it is impossible to set advertised
speed to same as link_speed.

Testing Hints: Try to set advertised speed
to 25G only with 25G default link (use ethtool -s 0x80000000)
