nfp: flower: fix ida_idx not being released

When looking for a global mac index the extra NFP_TUN_PRE_TUN_IDX_BIT
that gets set if nfp_flower_is_supported_bridge is true is not taken
into account. Consequently the path that should release the ida_index
in cleanup is never triggered, causing messages like:

    nfp 0000:02:00.0: nfp: Failed to offload MAC on br-ex.
    nfp 0000:02:00.0: nfp: Failed to offload MAC on br-ex.
    nfp 0000:02:00.0: nfp: Failed to offload MAC on br-ex.

after NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX number of reconfigs. Ultimately this lead to
new tunnel flows not being offloaded.

Fix this by unsetting the NFP_TUN_PRE_TUN_IDX_BIT before checking if
the port is of type OTHER.
