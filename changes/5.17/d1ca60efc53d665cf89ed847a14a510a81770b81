netfilter: ctnetlink: disable helper autoassign

When userspace, e.g. conntrackd, inserts an entry with a specified helper,
its possible that the helper is lost immediately after its added:

ctnetlink_create_conntrack
  -> nf_ct_helper_ext_add + assign helper
    -> ctnetlink_setup_nat
      -> ctnetlink_parse_nat_setup
         -> parse_nat_setup -> nfnetlink_parse_nat_setup
	                       -> nf_nat_setup_info
                                 -> nf_conntrack_alter_reply
                                   -> __nf_ct_try_assign_helper

... and __nf_ct_try_assign_helper will zero the helper again.

Set IPS_HELPER bit to bypass auto-assign logic, its unwanted, just like
when helper is assigned via ruleset.

Dropped old 'not strictly necessary' comment, it referred to use of
rcu_assign_pointer() before it got replaced by RCU_INIT_POINTER().

NB: Fixes tag intentionally incorrect, this extends the referenced commit,
but this change won't build without IPS_HELPER introduced there.
