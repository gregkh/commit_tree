KVM: x86/pmu: Don't truncate the PerfEvtSeln MSR when creating a perf event

AMD's event select is 3 nybbles, with the high nybble in bits 35:32 of
a PerfEvtSeln MSR. Don't drop the high nybble when setting up the
config field of a perf_event_attr structure for a call to
perf_event_create_kernel_counter().
