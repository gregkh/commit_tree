x86/MCE/AMD, EDAC/mce_amd: Add new SMCA bank types

Add HWID and McaType values for new SMCA bank types, and add their error
descriptions to edac_mce_amd.

The "PHY" bank types all have the same error descriptions, and the NBIF
and SHUB bank types have the same error descriptions. So reuse the same
arrays where appropriate.

  [ bp: Remove useless comments over hwid types. ]
