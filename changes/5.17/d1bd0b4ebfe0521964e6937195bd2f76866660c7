fs/buffer: Convert __block_write_begin_int() to take a folio

There are no plans to convert buffer_head infrastructure to use large
folios, but __block_write_begin_int() is called from iomap, and it's
more convenient and less error-prone if we pass in a folio from iomap.
It also has a nice saving of almost 200 bytes of code from removing
repeated calls to compound_head().
