ASoC: dt-bindings: qcom: sm8250: Document "aux-devs"

The sm8250 audio driver uses the common Qualcomm device tree parser and
therefore already supports the "aux-devs" property that allows adding
additional auxiliary devices to the sound card (e.g. analog speaker
amplifiers that can be connected using "audio-routing").

Document the property in the DT schema for sm8250 as well. The description
is taken from simple-card.yaml which has a very similar property.
