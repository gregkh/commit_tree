Revert "i40e: Fix reset bw limit when DCB enabled with 1 TC"

Revert of a patch that instead of fixing a AQ error when trying
to reset BW limit introduced several regressions related to
creation and managing TC. Currently there are errors when creating
a TC on both PF and VF.

Error log:
[17428.783095] i40e 0000:3b:00.1: AQ command Config VSI BW allocation per TC failed = 14
[17428.783107] i40e 0000:3b:00.1: Failed configuring TC map 0 for VSI 391
[17428.783254] i40e 0000:3b:00.1: AQ command Config VSI BW allocation per TC failed = 14
[17428.783259] i40e 0000:3b:00.1: Unable to  configure TC map 0 for VSI 391

This reverts commit 3d2504663c41104b4359a15f35670cfa82de1bbf.
