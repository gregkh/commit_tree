perf test: Skip failing sigtrap test for arm+aarch64

Skip the Sigtrap test for arm + arm64, same as was done for s390 in
commit a840974e96fd ("perf test: Test 73 Sig_trap fails on s390"). For
this, reuse BP_SIGNAL_IS_SUPPORTED - meaning that the arch can use BP to
generate signals - instead of BP_ACCOUNT_IS_SUPPORTED, which is
appropriate.

As described by Will at [0], in the test we get stuck in a loop of
handling the HW breakpoint exception and never making progress. GDB
handles this by stepping over the faulting instruction, but with perf
the kernel is expected to handle the step (which it doesn't for arm).

Dmitry made an attempt to get this work, also mentioned in the same
thread as [0], which was appreciated. But the best thing to do is skip
the test for now.
