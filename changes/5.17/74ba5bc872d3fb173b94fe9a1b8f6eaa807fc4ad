KVM: VMX: Use boolean returns for Posted Interrupt "test" helpers

Return bools instead of ints for the posted interrupt "test" helpers.
The bit position of the flag being test does not matter to the callers,
and is in fact lost by virtue of test_bit() itself returning a bool.

Returning ints is potentially dangerous, e.g. "pi_test_on(pi_desc) == 1"
is safe-ish because ON is bit 0 and thus any sane implementation of
pi_test_on() will work, but for SN (bit 1), checking "== 1" would rely on
pi_test_on() to return 0 or 1, a.k.a. bools, as opposed to 0 or 2 (the
positive bit position).
