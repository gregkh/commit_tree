lockd: introduce lockd_put()

There is some cleanup that is duplicated in lockd_down() and the failure
path of lockd_up().
Factor these out into a new lockd_put() and call it from both places.

lockd_put() does *not* take the mutex - that must be held by the caller.
It decrements nlmsvc_users and if that reaches zero, it cleans up.
