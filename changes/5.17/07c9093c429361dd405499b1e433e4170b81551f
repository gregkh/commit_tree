docs: sysfs-block: sort alphabetically

Sort the documentation for the files alphabetically by file path so that
there is a logical order and it's clear where to add new files.

With two small exceptions, this patch doesn't change the documentation
itself and just reorders it:

- In /sys/block/<disk>/<part>/stat, I replaced <part> with <partition>
  to be consistent with the other files.
- The description for /sys/block/<disk>/<part>/stat referred to another
  file "above", which I reworded.
