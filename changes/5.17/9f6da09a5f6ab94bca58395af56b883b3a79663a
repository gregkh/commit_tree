ath11k: enable IEEE80211_HW_SINGLE_SCAN_ON_ALL_BANDS for WCN6855

Currently mac80211 will send 3 scan request for each scan of WCN6855,
they are 2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz band scan. Firmware of WCN6855 will
cache the RNR IE(Reduced Neighbor Report element) which exist in the
beacon of 2.4 GHz/5 GHz of the AP which is co-located with 6 GHz,
and then use the cache to scan in 6 GHz band scan if the 6 GHz scan
is in the same scan with the 2.4 GHz/5 GHz band, this will helpful to
search more AP of 6 GHz. Also it will decrease the time cost of scan
because firmware will use dual-band scan for the 2.4 GHz/5 GHz, it
means the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz scans are doing simultaneously.

Set the flag IEEE80211_HW_SINGLE_SCAN_ON_ALL_BANDS for WCN6855 since
it supports 2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz and it is single pdev which means
all the 2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz exist in the same wiphy/ieee80211_hw.
