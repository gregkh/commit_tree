fanotify: use macros to get the offset to fanotify_info buffer

The fanotify_info buffer contains up to two file handles and a name.
Use macros to simplify the code that access the different items within
the buffer.

Add assertions to verify that stored fh len and name len do not overflow
the u8 stored value in fanotify_info header.

Remove the unused fanotify_info_len() helper.
