media: aspeed: fix mode-detect always time out at 2nd run

aspeed_video_get_resolution() will try to do res-detect again if the
timing got in last try is invalid. But it will always time out because
VE_SEQ_CTRL_TRIG_MODE_DET is only cleared after 1st mode-detect.

To fix the problem, just clear VE_SEQ_CTRL_TRIG_MODE_DET before setting
it in aspeed_video_enable_mode_detect().
