mxser: keep only !tty test in ISR

The others are superfluous with tty refcounting in place now. And they
are racy in fact:
* tty_port_initialized() reports false for a small moment after
  interrupts are enabled.
* closing is 1 while the port is still alive.

The queues are flushed later during close anyway. So there is no need
for this special handling. Actually, the ISR should not flush the
queues. It should behave as every other driver, just queue the chars
into tty buffer and go on. But this will be changed later. There is
still a lot code depending on having tty in ISR (and not only tty_port).
