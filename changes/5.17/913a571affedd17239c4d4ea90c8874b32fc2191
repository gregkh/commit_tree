io_uring: clean cqe filling functions

Split io_cqring_fill_event() into a couple of more targeted functions.
The first on is io_fill_cqe_aux() for completions that are not
associated with request completions and doing the ->cq_extra accounting.
Examples are additional CQEs from multishot poll and rsrc notifications.

The second is io_fill_cqe_req(), should be called when it's a normal
request completion. Nothing more to it at the moment, will be used in
later patches.

The last one is inlined __io_fill_cqe() for a finer grained control,
should be used with caution and in hottest places.
