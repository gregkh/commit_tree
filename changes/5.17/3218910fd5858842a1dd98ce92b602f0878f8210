dmaengine: Add core function and capability check for DMA_MEMCPY_SG

This is the old DMA_SG interface that was removed in commit
c678fa66341c ("dmaengine: remove DMA_SG as it is dead code in kernel"). It
has been renamed to DMA_MEMCPY_SG to better match the MEMSET and MEMSET_SG
naming convention.

It should only be used for mem2mem copies, either main system memory or
CPU-addressable device memory (like video memory on a PCI graphics card).

Bringing back this interface was prompted by the need to use the Xilinx
CDMA device for mem2mem SG transfers.
