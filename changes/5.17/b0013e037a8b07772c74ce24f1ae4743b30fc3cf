ACPI: Introduce Platform Firmware Runtime Telemetry driver

This driver allows user space to fetch telemetry data from the
firmware with the help of the Platform Firmware Runtime Telemetry
interface.

Both PFRU and PFRT are based on ACPI _DSM interfaces located under
special device objects in the ACPI Namespace, but these interfaces
are different from each other, so it is better to provide a separate
driver from each of them, even though they share some common
definitions and naming conventions.
