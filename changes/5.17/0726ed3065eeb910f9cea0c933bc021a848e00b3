drm/amd/display: Fix the uninitialized variable in enable_stream_features()

In function enable_stream_features(), the variable "old_downspread.raw"
could be uninitialized if core_link_read_dpcd() fails, however, it is
used in the later if statement, and further, core_link_write_dpcd()
may write random value, which is potentially unsafe.
