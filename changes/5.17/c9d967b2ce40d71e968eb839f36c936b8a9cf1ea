PM: wakeup: simplify the output logic of pm_show_wakelocks()

The buffer handling in pm_show_wakelocks() is tricky, and hopefully
correct.  Ensure it really is correct by using sysfs_emit_at() which
handles all of the tricky string handling logic in a PAGE_SIZE buffer
for us automatically as this is a sysfs file being read from.
