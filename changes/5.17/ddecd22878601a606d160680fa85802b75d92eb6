perf: uapi: Document perf_event_attr::sig_data truncation on 32 bit architectures

Due to the alignment requirements of siginfo_t, as described in
3ddb3fd8cdb0 ("signal, perf: Fix siginfo_t by avoiding u64 on 32-bit
architectures"), siginfo_t::si_perf_data is limited to an unsigned long.

However, perf_event_attr::sig_data is an u64, to avoid having to deal
with compat conversions. Due to being an u64, it may not immediately be
clear to users that sig_data is truncated on 32 bit architectures.

Add a comment to explicitly point this out, and hopefully help some
users save time by not having to deduce themselves what's happening.
