net/mlx5: E-switch, Remove vport enabled check

An eswitch vport of the devlink port is always enabled before a
devlink port is registered. And a eswitch vport is always disabled
after a devlink port is unregistered.
Hence avoid the vport enabled check in the devlink callback routine.
Such check is only applicable in the legacy SR-IOV callbacks.
