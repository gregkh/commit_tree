KVM: VMX: Drop unnecessary PI logic to handle impossible conditions

Drop sanity checks on the validity of the previous pCPU when handling
vCPU block/unlock for posted interrupts.  The intention behind the sanity
checks is to avoid memory corruption in case of a race or incorrect locking,
but the code has been stable for a few years now and the checks get in
the way of eliminating kvm_vcpu.pre_cpu.
