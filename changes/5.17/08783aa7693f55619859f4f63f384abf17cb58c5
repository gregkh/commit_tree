drm/i915: s/JSP2/ICP2/ PCH

This JSP2 PCH actually seems to be some special Apple
specific ICP variant rather than a JSP. Make it so. Or at
least all the references to it seem to be some Apple ICL
machines. Didn't manage to find these PCI IDs in any
public chipset docs unfortunately.

The only thing we're losing here with this JSP->ICP change
is Wa_14011294188, but based on the HSD that isn't actually
needed on any ICP based design (including JSP), only TGP
based stuff (including MCC) really need it. The documented
w/a just never made that distinction because Windows didn't
want to differentiate between JSP and MCC (not sure how
they handle hpd/ddc/etc. then though...).
