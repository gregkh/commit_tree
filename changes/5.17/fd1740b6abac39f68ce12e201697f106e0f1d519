bpf: Remove the cgroup -> bpf header dependecy

Remove the dependency from cgroup-defs.h to bpf-cgroup.h and bpf.h.
This reduces the incremental build size of x86 allmodconfig after
bpf.h was touched from ~17k objects rebuilt to ~5k objects.
bpf.h is 2.2kLoC and is modified relatively often.

We need a new header with just the definition of struct cgroup_bpf
and enum cgroup_bpf_attach_type, this is akin to cgroup-defs.h.
