paride: fix up build warning on mips platforms

MIPS include files define "PC" so when building the paride driver the
following build warning shows up:

	rivers/block/paride/bpck.c:32: warning: "PC" redefined

Fix this by undefining PC before redefining it as is done for other
defines in this driver.
