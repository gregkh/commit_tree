net/mlx5: Introduce API for bulk request and release of IRQs

Currently IRQs are requested one by one. To balance spreading IRQs
among cpus using such scheme requires remembering cpu mask for the
cpus used for a given device. This complicates the IRQ allocation
scheme in subsequent patch.

Hence, prepare the code for bulk IRQs allocation. This enables
spreading IRQs among cpus in subsequent patch.
