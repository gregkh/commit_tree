arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996-xiaomi-common: Change TUSB320 to TUSB320L

This platform actually doesn't have TUSB320, but rather TUSB320L.
The TUSB320 compatible string was used due to lack of support for
TUSB320L, and it was close enough to detect cable plug-in and
direction, but it was limited to upstream facing port mode only.
Now that support for TUSB320L is added[1], change node name and
compatible to match and allow it to be properly reset and have
its mode set to dual-role port.
