mtip32xx: remove pointless drvdata lookups

Previously we passed a struct pci_dev * to mtip_check_surprise_removal(),
which immediately looked up the driver_data.  But all callers already have
the driver_data pointer, so just pass it directly and skip the extra
lookup.  No functional change intended.
