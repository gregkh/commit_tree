iio: chemical: sunrise_co2: set val parameter only on success

Clang static analysis reports this representative warning

sunrise_co2.c:410:9: warning: Assigned value is garbage or undefined
  *val = value;
       ^ ~~~~~

The ealier call to sunrise_read_word can fail without setting
value.  So defer setting val until we know the read was successful.
