arm64: dts: qcom: Add missing 'chassis-type's

Add the "chassis-type" to msm8916-samsung-serranove and
sm7225-fairphone-fp4 that were posted before the patch that added the
chassis-type to existing device trees, but merged after it.

Also, looks like sdm636-sony-xperia-ganges-mermaid was missing in
commit eaa744b1c101 ("arm64: dts: qcom: add 'chassis-type' property")
so add it there as well.
