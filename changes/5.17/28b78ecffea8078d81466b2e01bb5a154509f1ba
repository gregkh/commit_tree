netfilter: bridge: add support for pppoe filtering

This makes 'bridge-nf-filter-pppoe-tagged' sysctl work for
bridged traffic.

Looking at the original commit it doesn't appear this ever worked:

 static unsigned int br_nf_post_routing(unsigned int hook, struct sk_buff **pskb,
[..]
        if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_8021Q)) {
                skb_pull(skb, VLAN_HLEN);
                skb->network_header += VLAN_HLEN;
+       } else if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_PPP_SES)) {
+               skb_pull(skb, PPPOE_SES_HLEN);
+               skb->network_header += PPPOE_SES_HLEN;
        }
 [..]
	NF_HOOK(... POST_ROUTING, ...)

... but the adjusted offsets are never restored.

The alternative would be to rip this code out for good,
but otoh we'd have to keep this anyway for the vlan handling
(which works because vlan tag info is in the skb, not the packet
 payload).
