firmware: cs_dsp: Add support for rev 2 coefficient files

Add support for the revision 2 coefficient file, this format is
identical to revision 1 and was simply added by accident to some
firmware. However unfortunately many firmwares have leaked into
production using this and as such driver support really needs to
be added for it.
