interconnect: icc-rpm: Support child NoC device probe

As shown in downstream DT[1], the System NoC of QCM2290 is modelled
using 4 fab/noc devices: sys_noc + qup_virt + mmnrt_virt + mmrt_virt.
Among those 3 virtual devices, qup is owned by RPM and has no regmap
resource, while mmnrt and mmrt are owned by AP and share the same
regmap as sys_noc.  So it's logical to represent these virtual devices
as child nodes of sys_noc in DT, so that such configuration can be
supported with a couple of changes on qnoc_probe():

- If there are child nodes, populate them.
- If the device descriptor has .regmap_cfg but there is no IOMEM
  resource for the device, use parent's regmap.
