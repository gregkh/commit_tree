md: use default_groups in kobj_type

There are currently 2 ways to create a set of sysfs files for a
kobj_type, through the default_attrs field, and the default_groups
field.  Move the md rdev sysfs code to use default_groups field which
has been the preferred way since commit aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add
support for default attribute groups to kobj_type") so that we can soon
get rid of the obsolete default_attrs field.
