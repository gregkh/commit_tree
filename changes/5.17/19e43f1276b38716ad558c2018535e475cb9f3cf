drm/amd/display: Add version check before using DP alt query interface

[Why]
To maintain compatibility with firmware older than 4.0.11.

Those firmware may have interrmittent hangs with RDCSPIPE or the PHY,
but we shouldn't regress their previous behavior.

[How]
Use the new path if firmware is development or 4.0.11 or newer. Use the
legacy path otherwise.
