KVM: nVMX: Track whether changes in L0 require MSR bitmap for L2 to be rebuilt

Introduce a flag to keep track of whether MSR bitmap for L2 needs to be
rebuilt due to changes in MSR bitmap for L1 or switching to a different
L2. This information will be used for Enlightened MSR Bitmap feature for
Hyper-V guests.

Note, setting msr_bitmap_changed to 'true' from set_current_vmptr() is
not really needed for Enlightened MSR Bitmap as the feature can only
be used in conjunction with Enlightened VMCS but let's keep tracking
information complete, it's cheap and in the future similar PV feature can
easily be implemented for KVM on KVM too.

No functional change intended.
