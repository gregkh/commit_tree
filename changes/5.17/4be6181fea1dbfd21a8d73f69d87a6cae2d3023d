scsi: libsas: Decode SAM status and host byte codes

Value 0 is used for SAM status and libsas exec_status bytes codes in
sas_end_task() - use defined macros instead. In addition, change to proper
enum types.

Also replace SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION with SAS_SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION,
the former being a proper member of enum exec_status.
