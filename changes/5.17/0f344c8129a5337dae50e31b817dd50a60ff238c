i40e: Fix for failed to init adminq while VF reset

Fix for failed to init adminq: -53 while VF is resetting via MAC
address changing procedure.
Added sync module to avoid reading deadbeef value in reinit adminq
during software reset.
Without this patch it is possible to trigger VF reset procedure
during reinit adminq. This resulted in an incorrect reading of
value from the AQP registers and generated the -53 error.
