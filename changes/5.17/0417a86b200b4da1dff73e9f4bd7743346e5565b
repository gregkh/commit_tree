arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Specify "data-lanes" for DSI host output

MSM DSI host driver actually parses "data-lanes" in DT and compare
it with the number of DSI lanes the bridge driver sets for
mipi_dsi_device. So we need to always specify "data-lanes" for the
DSI host output. As of now, "data-lanes" is added to ti-sn65dsi86 dts
fragment, but missing in parade-ps8640 dts fragment, which requires
a fixup.

Since we'll do 4-lane DSI regardless of which bridge chip is used,
instead of adding "data-lanes" to parade-ps8640 dts fragment, let's
just move "data-lanes" from the bridge dts to sc7180-trogdor.dtsi.
