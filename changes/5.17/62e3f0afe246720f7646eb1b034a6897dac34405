usb: dwc3: pci: Fix Bay Trail phy GPIO mappings

When the Bay Trail phy GPIO mappings where added cs and reset were swapped,
this did not cause any issues sofar, because sofar they were always driven
high/low at the same time.

Note the new mapping has been verified both in /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
output on Android factory images on multiple devices, as well as in
the schematics for some devices.
