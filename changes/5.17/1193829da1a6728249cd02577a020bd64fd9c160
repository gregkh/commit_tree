delayacct: cleanup flags in struct task_delay_info and functions use it

Flags in struct task_delay_info is used to distinguish the difference
between swapin and blkio delay acountings.  But after patch "delayacct:
support swapin delay accounting for swapping without blkio", there is no
need to do that since swapin and blkio delay accounting use their own
functions.
