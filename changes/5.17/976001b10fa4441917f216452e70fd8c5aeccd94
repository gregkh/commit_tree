ASoC: cs42l42: Remove redundant writes to DETECT_MODE

There are multiple places where DETECT_MODE is included in a register
write, but in every case it is written as 0. Removing these redundant
writes makes the code less cluttered and also makes it obvious that
DETECT_MODE is never changed.

A single initialization to 0 is added to cs42l42_setup_hs_type_detect().
