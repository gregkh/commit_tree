mm: allow !GFP_KERNEL allocations for kvmalloc

Support for GFP_NO{FS,IO} and __GFP_NOFAIL has been implemented by
previous patches so we can allow the support for kvmalloc.  This will
allow some external users to simplify or completely remove their
helpers.

GFP_NOWAIT semantic hasn't been supported so far but it hasn't been
explicitly documented so let's add a note about that.

ceph_kvmalloc is the first helper to be dropped and changed to kvmalloc.
