mm/memcg: add oom_group_kill memory event

Our container agent wants to know when a container exits if it was OOM
killed or not to report to the user.  We use memory.oom.group = 1 to
ensure that OOM kills within the container's cgroup kill everything.
Existing memory.events are insufficient for knowing if this triggered:

1) Our current approach reads memory.events oom_kill and reports the
   container was killed if the value is non-zero. This is erroneous in
   some cases where containers create their children cgroups with
   memory.oom.group=1 as such OOM kills will get counted against the
   container cgroup's oom_kill counter despite not actually OOM killing
   the entire container.

2) Reading memory.events.local will fail to identify OOM kills in leaf
   cgroups (that don't set memory.oom.group) within the container
   cgroup.

This patch adds a new oom_group_kill event when memory.oom.group
triggers to allow userspace to cleanly identify when an entire cgroup is
oom killed.
