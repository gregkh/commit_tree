drm/qxl: use iterator instead of dma_resv_shared_list

I'm not sure why it is useful to know the number of fences
in the reservation object, but we try to avoid exposing the
dma_resv_shared_list() function.

So use the iterator instead. If more information is desired
we could use dma_resv_describe() as well.
