fscache: Implement cookie invalidation

Add a function to invalidate the cache behind a cookie:

	void fscache_invalidate(struct fscache_cookie *cookie,
				const void *aux_data,
				loff_t size,
				unsigned int flags)

This causes any cached data for the specified cookie to be discarded.  If
the cookie is marked as being in use, a new cache object will be created if
possible and future I/O will use that instead.  In-flight I/O should be
abandoned (writes) or reconsidered (reads).  Each time it is called
cookie->inval_counter is incremented and this can be used to detect
invalidation at the end of an I/O operation.

The coherency data attached to the cookie can be updated and the cookie
size should be reset.  One flag is available, FSCACHE_INVAL_DIO_WRITE,
which should be used to indicate invalidation due to a DIO write on a
file.  This will temporarily disable caching for this cookie.

Changes
