ath11k: Send PPDU_STATS_CFG with proper pdev mask to firmware

HTT_PPDU_STATS_CFG_PDEV_ID bit mask for target FW PPDU stats request message
was set as bit 8 to 15. Bit 8 is reserved for soc stats and pdev id starts from
bit 9. Hence change the bitmask as bit 9 to 15 and fill the proper pdev id in
the request message.

In commit 701e48a43e15 ("ath11k: add packet log support for QCA6390"), both
HTT_PPDU_STATS_CFG_PDEV_ID and pdev_mask were changed, but this pdev_mask
calculation is not valid for platforms which has multiple pdevs with 1 rxdma
per pdev, as this is writing same value(i.e. 2) for all pdevs.  Hence fixed it
to consider pdev_idx as well, to make it compatible for both single and multi
pd cases.

Tested on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.5.0.1-01092-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
Tested on: IPQ6018 hw1.0 WLAN.HK.2.5.0.1-01067-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
