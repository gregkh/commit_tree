bnx2x: fix driver load from initrd

Commit b7a49f73059f ("bnx2x: Utilize firmware 7.13.21.0") added
new firmware support in the driver with maintaining older firmware
compatibility. However, older firmware was not added in MODULE_FIRMWARE()
which caused missing firmware files in initrd image leading to driver load
failure from initrd. This patch adds MODULE_FIRMWARE() for older firmware
version to have firmware files included in initrd.
