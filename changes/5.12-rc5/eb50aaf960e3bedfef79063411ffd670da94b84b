ACPI: scan: Use unique number for instance_no

The decrementation of acpi_device_bus_id->instance_no
in acpi_device_del() is incorrect, because it may cause
a duplicate instance number to be allocated next time
a device with the same acpi_device_bus_id is added.

Replace above mentioned approach by using IDA framework.

While at it, define the instance range to be [0, 4096).

Fixes: e49bd2dd5a50 ("ACPI: use PNPID:instance_no as bus_id of ACPI device")
Fixes: ca9dc8d42b30 ("ACPI / scan: Fix acpi_bus_id_list bookkeeping")
