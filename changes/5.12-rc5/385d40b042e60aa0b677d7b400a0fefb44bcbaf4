net/mlx5e: Don't match on Geneve options in case option masks are all zero

The cited change added offload support for Geneve options without verifying
the validity of the options masks, this caused offload of rules with match
on Geneve options with class,type and data masks which are zero to fail.

Fix by ignoring the match on Geneve options in case option masks are
all zero.
