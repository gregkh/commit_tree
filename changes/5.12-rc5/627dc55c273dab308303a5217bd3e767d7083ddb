drm/msm/disp/dpu1: icc path needs to be set before dpu runtime resume

DPU runtime resume will request for a min vote on the AXI bus as
it is a necessary step before turning ON the AXI clock.

The change does below
1) Move the icc path set before requesting runtime get_sync.
2) remove the dependency of hw catalog for min ib vote
as it is initialized at a later point.
