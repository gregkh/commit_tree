iwlwifi: mvm: move early time-point before nvm_init in non-unified

We were starting the early time-point too late in non-unified
firmwares.  Unlike with unified firmwares, we were starting it only
after reading the NVM, so errors in the NVM read phase were not
logged.

Solve this by moving the time-point to the same place as we do with
unified firmwares, i.e. just before we go into the wait-alive code.
