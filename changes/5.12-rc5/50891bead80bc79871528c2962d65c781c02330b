drm/etnaviv: User FOLL_LONGTERM in userptr

There's no mmu notifier or anything like that, releasing this pin is
entirely up to userspace. Hence FOLL_LONGTERM.

No cc: stable for this patch since a lot of the infrastructure around
FOLL_LONGETRM (like not allowing it for pages currently sitting in
ZONE_MOVEABLE before they're migrated) is still being worked on. So
not big benefits yet.
