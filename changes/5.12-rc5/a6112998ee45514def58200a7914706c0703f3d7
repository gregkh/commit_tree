gpio: fix NULL-deref-on-deregistration regression

Fix a NULL-pointer deference when deregistering the gpio character
device that was introduced by the recent stub-driver hack. When the new
"driver" is unbound as part of deregistration, driver core clears the
driver-data pointer which is used to retrieve the struct gpio_device in
its release callback.

Fix this by using container_of() in the release callback as should have
been done all along.
