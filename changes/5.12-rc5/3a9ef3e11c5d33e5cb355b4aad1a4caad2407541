net: ipa: terminate message handler arrays

When a QMI handle is initialized, an array of message handler
structures is provided, defining how any received message should
be handled based on its type and message ID.  The QMI core code
traverses this array when a message arrives and calls the function
associated with the (type, msg_id) found in the array.

The array is supposed to be terminated with an empty (all zero)
entry though.  Without it, an unsupported message will cause
the QMI core code to go past the end of the array.

Fix this bug, by properly terminating the message handler arrays
provided when QMI handles are set up by the IPA driver.
