namespace: take lock_mount_hash() directly when changing flags

Changing mount options always ends up taking lock_mount_hash() but when
MNT_READONLY is requested and neither the mount nor the superblock are
MNT_READONLY we end up taking the lock, dropping it, and retaking it to
change the other mount attributes. Instead, let's acquire the lock once
when changing the mount attributes. This simplifies the locking in these
codepath, makes them easier to reason about and avoids having to
reacquire the lock right after dropping it.
