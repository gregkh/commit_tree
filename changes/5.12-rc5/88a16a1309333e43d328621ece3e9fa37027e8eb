perf: Add build id data in mmap2 event

Adding support to carry build id data in mmap2 event.

The build id data replaces maj/min/ino/ino_generation
fields, which are also used to identify map's binary,
so it's ok to replace them with build id data:

  union {
          struct {
                  u32       maj;
                  u32       min;
                  u64       ino;
                  u64       ino_generation;
          };
          struct {
                  u8        build_id_size;
                  u8        __reserved_1;
                  u16       __reserved_2;
                  u8        build_id[20];
          };
  };

Replaced maj/min/ino/ino_generation fields give us size
of 24 bytes. We use 20 bytes for build id data, 1 byte
for size and rest is unused.

There's new misc bit for mmap2 to signal there's build
id data in it:

  #define PERF_RECORD_MISC_MMAP_BUILD_ID   (1 << 14)
