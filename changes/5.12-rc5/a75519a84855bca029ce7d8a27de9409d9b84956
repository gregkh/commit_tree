igb: Fix duplicate include guard

The include guard "_E1000_HW_H_" is used by two separate header files in
two different drivers (e1000/e1000_hw.h and igb/e1000_hw.h). Using the
same include guard macro in more than one header file may cause
unexpected behavior from the compiler. Fix this by renaming the
duplicate guard in the igb driver.
