netfilter: ctnetlink: fix dump of the expect mask attribute

Before this change, the mask is never included in the netlink message, so
"conntrack -E expect" always prints 0.0.0.0.

In older kernels the l3num callback struct was passed as argument, based
on tuple->src.l3num. After the l3num indirection got removed, the call
chain is based on m.src.l3num, but this value is 0xffff.

Init l3num to the correct value.
