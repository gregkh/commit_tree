btrfs: zoned: do not load fs_info::zoned from incompat flag

Don't set the zoned flag in fs_info as soon as we're encountering the
incompat filesystem flag for a zoned filesystem on mount. The zoned flag
in fs_info is in a union together with the zone_size, so setting it too
early will result in setting an incorrect zone_size as well.

Once the correct zone_size is read from the device, we can rely on the
zoned flag in fs_info as well to determine if the filesystem is zoned.
