drm/i915/display: Let PCON convert from RGB to YCbCr if it can

If PCON has capability to convert RGB->YCbCr colorspace and also
to 444->420 downsampling then for any YUV420 only mode, we can
let the PCON do all the conversion. If the PCON supports
RGB->YCbCr conversion for all BT2020, BT709, BT601, choose
the one that is selected by userspace via connector colorspace
property, otherwise default to BT601.

v2: As suggested by Uma Shankar, considered case for colorspace
BT709 and BT2020, and default to BT601. Also appended dir
'display' in commit message.

v3: Fixed typo in condition for printing one of the error msg.

v4: As suggested by Uma Shankar:
-Fixed bug in determining the colorspace for RGB->YCbCr conversion.
-Fixed minor formatting issues
Also updated the commit message as per latest changes.
