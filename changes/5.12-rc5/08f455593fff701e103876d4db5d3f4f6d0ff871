btrfs: zoned: cache if block group is on a sequential zone

On a zoned filesystem, cache if a block group is on a sequential write
only zone.

On sequential write only zones, we can use REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND for
writing data, therefore provide btrfs_use_zone_append() to figure out if
IO is targeting a sequential write only zone and we can use
REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND for data writing.
