ASoC: rt5670: Remove 'HP Playback Switch' control

The RT5670_L_MUTE_SFT and RT5670_R_MUTE_SFT bits (bits 15 and 7) of the
RT5670_HP_VOL register are set / unset by the headphones deplop code
run by rt5670_hp_event() on SND_SOC_DAPM_POST_PMU / SND_SOC_DAPM_PRE_PMD.

So we should not also export a control to userspace which toggles these
same bits.

This should not cause any issues for userspace. AFAICT the rt567x codecs
are only used on x86/ACPI devices and the UCM profiles used there do not
use the "HP Playback Switch" control.
