kcov, usbip: collect coverage from vhci_rx_loop

Add kcov_remote_start()/kcov_remote_stop() annotations to the
vhci_rx_loop() function, which is responsible for parsing USB/IP packets
coming into USB/IP client.

Since vhci_rx_loop() threads are spawned per vhci_hcd device instance, the
common kcov handle is used for kcov_remote_start()/stop() annotations
(see Documentation/dev-tools/kcov.rst for details). As the result kcov
can now be used to collect coverage from vhci_rx_loop() threads.
