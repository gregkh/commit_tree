riscv: Fix compilation error with Canaan SoC

When CONFIG_SOC_CANAAN is selected, the K210 sysctl driver is always
compiled. Since this driver early init function calls the function
k210_clk_early_init() implemented by the K210 clk driver, this driver
must also always be selected for compilation ot avoid build failures.

Avoid such build failures by always selecting CONFIG_COMMON_CLK and
CONFIG_COMMON_CLK_K210 when CONFIG_SOC_CANAAN is enabled.
