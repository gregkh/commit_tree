io_uring: don't cancel extra on files match

As tasks always wait and kill their io-wq on exec/exit, files are of no
more concern to us, so we don't need to specifically cancel them by hand
in those cases. Moreover we should not, because io_match_task() looks at
req->task->files now, which is always true and so leads to extra
cancellations, that wasn't a case before per-task io-wq.
