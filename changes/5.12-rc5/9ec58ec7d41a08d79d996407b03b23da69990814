scsi: lpfc: Fix NVMe recovery after mailbox timeout

If a mailbox command times out, the SLI port is deemed in error and the
port is reset.  The HBA cleanup is not returning I/Os to the NVMe layer
before the port is unregistered. This is due to the HBA being marked
offline (!SLI_ACTIVE) and cleanup being done by the mailbox timeout handler
rather than an general adapter reset routine.  The mailbox timeout handler
mailbox handler only cleaned up SCSI I/Os.

Fix by reworking the mailbox handler to:

 - After handling the mailbox error, detect the board is already in
   failure (may be due to another error), and leave cleanup to the
   other handler.

 - If the mailbox command timeout is initial detector of the port error,
   continue with the board cleanup and marking the adapter offline
   (!SLI_ACTIVE). Remove the SCSI-only I/O cleanup routine. The generic
   reset adapter routine that is subsequently invoked, will clean up the
   I/Os.

 - Have the reset adapter routine flush all NVMe and SCSI I/Os if the
   adapter has been marked failed (!SLI_ACTIVE).

 - Rework the NVMe I/O terminate routine to take a status code to fail the
   I/O with and update so that cleaned up I/O calls the wqe completion
   routine. Currently it is bypassing the wqe cleanup and calling the NVMe
   I/O completion directly. The wqe completion routine will take care of
   data structure and node cleanup then call the NVMe I/O completion
   handler.
