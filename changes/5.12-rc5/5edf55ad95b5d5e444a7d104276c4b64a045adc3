bonding: 3ad: Print an error for unknown speeds

The bond driver needs to be patched to support new ethtool speeds.
Currently it emits a single warning [1] when it encounters an unknown
speed. As evident by the two previous patches, this is not explicit
enough. Instead, promote it to an error.

bond10: (slave swp1): unknown ethtool speed (200000) for port 1 (set it to 0)

v2:
* Use pr_err_once() instead of WARN_ONCE()
