net: mvpp2: fix interrupt mask/unmask skip condition

The condition should be skipped if CPU ID equal to nthreads.
The patch doesn't fix any actual issue since
nthreads = min_t(unsigned int, num_present_cpus(), MVPP2_MAX_THREADS).
On all current Armada platforms, the number of CPU's is
less than MVPP2_MAX_THREADS.
