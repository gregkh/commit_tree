btrfs: remove always true condition in btrfs_start_delalloc_roots

Following the rework in e076ab2a2ca7 ("btrfs: shrink delalloc pages
instead of full inodes") the nr variable is no longer passed by
reference to start_delalloc_inodes hence it cannot change. Additionally
we are always guaranteed for it to be positive number hence it's
redundant to have it as a condition in the loop. Simply remove that
usage.
