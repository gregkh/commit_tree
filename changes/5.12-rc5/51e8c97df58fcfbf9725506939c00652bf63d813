media: ti-vpe: cal: Rename struct cal_fmt to cal_format_info

The cal_fmt structure stores information about a format. Its name is
ambiguous, as it could be understood as storing a format. Furthermore,
instances of the structure are called 'fmt' through the code, which
leads to confusion with the 'format' variables. Rename the structure to
cal_format_info, and the corresponding 'fmt' variables to 'fmtinfo'.
