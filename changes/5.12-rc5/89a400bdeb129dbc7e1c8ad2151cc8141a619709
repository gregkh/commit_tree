ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: enable DMI L1 for D0i3-compatible streams

DMI L1 entry is currently disabled whenever any capture stream is
opened to prevent xruns during pause/release. But, in
order to maximise power savings for the wake-on-voice usecase,
DMI L1 entry should be enabled for D0i3-compatible capture streams.
Introduce a new field, flags in struct sof_intel_hda_stream
that stores whether a stream is dmi_l1_compatible. All playback streams,
and D0i3-compatible capture streams are DMI L1 compatible.
