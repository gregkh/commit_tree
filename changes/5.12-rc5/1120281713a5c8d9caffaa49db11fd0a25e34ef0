torture: Do Kconfig analysis only once per scenario

Currently, if a scenario is repeated as in "--configs '4*TREE01'",
the Kconfig analysis is performed for each occurrance (four times in
this example) and each analysis places the exact same data into the
exact same files.  This is not really an issue in this repetition-four
example, but it can needlessly consume tens of seconds of wallclock time
for something like "--config '128*TINY01'".

This commit therefore does Kconfig analysis only once per set of
repeats of a given scenario, courtesy of the "sort -u" command and an
automatically generated awk script.

While in the area, this commit also wordsmiths a comment.
