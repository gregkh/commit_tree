regulator: core.c: Replace references to non-existent function

The function regulator_set_device_supply() is referenced a few times in
comments in regulator/core.c; however this function was removed a long
time ago by commit a5766f11cfd3 ("regulator: core - Rework machine API to
remove string based functions."). Update those references to point to
set_consumer_device_supply(), which replaced the old function.
