selftest: kvm: x86: test KVM_GET_CPUID2 and guest visible CPUIDs against KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID

Commit 181f494888d5 ("KVM: x86: fix CPUID entries returned by
KVM_GET_CPUID2 ioctl") revealed that we're not testing KVM_GET_CPUID2
ioctl at all. Add a test for it and also check that from inside the guest
visible CPUIDs are equal to it's output.
