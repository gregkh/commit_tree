net: stmmac: fix CBS idleslope and sendslope calculation

When link speed is not 100 Mbps, port transmit rate and speed divider
are set to 8 and 1000000 respectively. These values are incorrect for
CBS idleslope and sendslope HW values calculation if the link speed is
not 1 Gbps.

This patch adds switch statement to set the values of port transmit rate
and speed divider for 10 Gbps, 5 Gbps, 2.5 Gbps, 1 Gbps, and 100 Mbps.
Note that CBS is not supported at 10 Mbps.

Fixes: 1f705bc61aee ("net: stmmac: Add support for CBS QDISC")
