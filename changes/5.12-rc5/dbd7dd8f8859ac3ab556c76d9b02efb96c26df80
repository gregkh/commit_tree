platform/x86: hp-wmi: Don't log a warning on HPWMI_RET_UNKNOWN_COMMAND errors

The recently added thermal policy support makes a
hp_wmi_perform_query(0x4c, ...) call on older devices which do not
support thermal policies this causes the following warning to be
logged (seen on a HP Stream x360 Convertible PC 11):

[   26.805305] hp_wmi: query 0x4c returned error 0x3

Error 0x3 is HPWMI_RET_UNKNOWN_COMMAND error. This commit silences
the warning for unknown-command errors, silencing the new warning.
