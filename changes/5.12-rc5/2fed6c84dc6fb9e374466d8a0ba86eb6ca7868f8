media: ccs: Hardware requires a delay after starting the clock of lifting reset

A CCS compliant device requires a delay before the first IÂ²C transaction
after pulling xshutdown up or starting the external clock. This is what
the driver does. However, if neither is actually there, there's no need
for the delay.

This also has the effect of removing an unnecessary delay on ACPI systems
where ACPI is responsible for the power-up sequence.
