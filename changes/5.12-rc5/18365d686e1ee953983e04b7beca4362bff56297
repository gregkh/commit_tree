platform/x86: intel_scu_wdt: Move driver from arch/x86

The ACPI-enabled Intel MID platforms neither have WDAT table nor proper IDs
to instantiate watchdog device. In order to keep them working move the board
code from arch/x86 to drivers/platform/x86.

Note, the complete SFI support is going to be removed, that's why PDx86
has been chosen as a new home for it. This is the only device which needs
additional code so far.
