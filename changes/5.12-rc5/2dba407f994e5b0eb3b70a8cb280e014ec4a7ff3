net: bridge: multicast: make tracked EHT hosts limit configurable

Add two new port attributes which make EHT hosts limit configurable and
export the current number of tracked EHT hosts:
 - IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_EHT_HOSTS_LIMIT: configure/retrieve current limit
 - IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_EHT_HOSTS_CNT: current number of tracked hosts
Setting IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_EHT_HOSTS_LIMIT to 0 is currently not allowed.

Note that we have to increase RTNL_SLAVE_MAX_TYPE to 38 minimum, I've
increased it to 40 to have space for two more future entries.

v2: move br_multicast_eht_set_hosts_limit() to br_multicast_eht.c,
    no functional change
