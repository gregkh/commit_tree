KVM: x86/mmu: Factor out functions to add/remove TDP MMU pages

Move the work of adding and removing TDP MMU pages to/from  "secondary"
data structures to helper functions. These functions will be built on in
future commits to enable MMU operations to proceed (mostly) in parallel.

No functional change expected.
