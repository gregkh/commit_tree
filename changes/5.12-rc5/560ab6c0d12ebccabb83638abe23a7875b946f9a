xfs: Fix 'set but not used' warning in xfs_bmap_compute_alignments()

With both CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG and CONFIG_XFS_WARN disabled, the only reference to
local variable "error" in xfs_bmap_compute_alignments() gets eliminated during
pre-processing stage of the compilation process. This causes the compiler to
generate a "set but not used" warning.
