dt-bindings: PCI: brcmstb: add BCM4908 binding

BCM4908 is a SoC family with PCIe controller sharing design with the one
for STB. BCM4908 has different power management and memory controller so
few tweaks are required.

PERST# signal on BCM4908 is handled by an external MISC block so it
needs specifying a reset phandle.
