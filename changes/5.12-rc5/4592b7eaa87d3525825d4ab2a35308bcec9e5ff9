KVM: x86: hyper-v: Allocate 'struct kvm_vcpu_hv' dynamically

Hyper-V context is only needed for guests which use Hyper-V emulation in
KVM (e.g. Windows/Hyper-V guests). 'struct kvm_vcpu_hv' is, however, quite
big, it accounts for more than 1/4 of the total 'struct kvm_vcpu_arch'
which is also quite big already. This all looks like a waste.

Allocate 'struct kvm_vcpu_hv' dynamically. This patch does not bring any
(intentional) functional change as we still allocate the context
unconditionally but it paves the way to doing that only when needed.
