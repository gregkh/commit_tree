mm: add and use find_lock_entries

We have three functions (shmem_undo_range(), truncate_inode_pages_range()
and invalidate_mapping_pages()) which want exactly this function, so add
it to filemap.c.  Before this patch, shmem_undo_range() would split any
compound page which overlaps either end of the range being punched in both
the first and second loops through the address space.  After this patch,
that functionality is left for the second loop, which is arguably more
appropriate since the first loop is supposed to run through all the pages
quickly, and splitting a page can sleep.
