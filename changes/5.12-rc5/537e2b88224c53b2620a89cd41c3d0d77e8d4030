net: dsa: felix: the switch does not support DMA

The code that sets the DMA mask to 64 bits is bogus, it is taken from
the enetc driver together with the rest of the PCI probing boilerplate.

Since this patch is touching the error path to delete err_dma, let's
also change the err_alloc_felix label which was incorrect. The kzalloc
failure does not need a kfree, but it doesn't hurt either, since kfree
works with NULL pointers.
