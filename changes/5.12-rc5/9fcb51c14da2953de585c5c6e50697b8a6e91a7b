x86/build: Turn off -fcf-protection for realmode targets

The new Ubuntu GCC packages turn on -fcf-protection globally,
which causes a build failure in the x86 realmode code:

  cc1: error: ‘-fcf-protection’ is not compatible with this target

Turn it off explicitly on compilers that understand this option.
