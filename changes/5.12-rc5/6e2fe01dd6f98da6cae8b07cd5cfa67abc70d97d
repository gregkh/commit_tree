can: c_can: move runtime PM enable/disable to c_can_platform

Currently doing modprobe c_can_pci will make the kernel complain:

    Unbalanced pm_runtime_enable!

this is caused by pm_runtime_enable() called before pm is initialized.

This fix is similar to 227619c3ff7c, move those pm_enable/disable code
to c_can_platform.

Fixes: 4cdd34b26826 ("can: c_can: Add runtime PM support to Bosch C_CAN/D_CAN controller")
