Revert "netfilter: x_tables: Switch synchronization to RCU"

This reverts commit cc00bcaa589914096edef7fb87ca5cee4a166b5c.

This (and the preceding) patch basically re-implemented the RCU
mechanisms of patch 784544739a25. That patch was replaced because of the
performance problems that it created when replacing tables. Now, we have
the same issue: the call to synchronize_rcu() makes replacing tables
slower by as much as an order of magnitude.

Prior to using RCU a script calling "iptables" approx. 200 times was
taking 1.16s. With RCU this increased to 11.59s.

Revert these patches and fix the issue in a different way.
