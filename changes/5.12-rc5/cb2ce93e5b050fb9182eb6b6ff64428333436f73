drm/i915/gem: Differentiate oom failures from invalid map types

After a cursory check on the parameters to i915_gem_object_pin_map(),
where we return a precise error, if the backend rejects the mapping we
always return PTR_ERR(-ENOMEM). Let us also return a more precise error
here so we can differentiate between running out of memory and
programming errors (or situations where we may be trying different paths
and looking for an error from an unsupported map).
