tracing: add error_report_end trace point

Patch series "Add error_report_end tracepoint to KFENCE and KASAN", v3.

This patchset adds a tracepoint, error_repor_end, that is to be used by
KFENCE, KASAN, and potentially other bug detection tools, when they print
an error report.  One of the possible use cases is userspace collection of
kernel error reports: interested parties can subscribe to the tracing
event via tracefs, and get notified when an error report occurs.

This patch (of 3):

Introduce error_report_end tracepoint.  It can be used in debugging tools
like KASAN, KFENCE, etc.  to provide extensions to the error reporting
mechanisms (e.g.  allow tests hook into error reporting, ease error report
collection from production kernels).  Another benefit would be making use
of ftrace for debugging or benchmarking the tools themselves.

Should we need it, the tracepoint name leaves us with the possibility to
introduce a complementary error_report_start tracepoint in the future.
