RDMA/cma: Delete useless kfree code

The parameter of kfree function is NULL, so kfree code is useless, delete
it.  Therefore, goto expression is no longer needed, so simplify
it. cma_dev_group is always pre-zero'd before reaching make_cma_ports, so
the NULL set to cma_dev_group->ports is unneeded too.
