dm: don't report "detected capacity change" on device creation

When a DM device is first created it doesn't yet have an established
capacity, therefore the use of set_capacity_and_notify() should be
conditional given the potential for needless pr_info "detected
capacity change" noise even if capacity is 0.

One could argue that the pr_info() in set_capacity_and_notify() is
misplaced, but that position is not held uniformly.
