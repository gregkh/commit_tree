i40e: move headroom initialization to i40e_configure_rx_ring

i40e_rx_offset(), that is supposed to initialize the Rx buffer headroom,
relies on I40E_RXR_FLAGS_BUILD_SKB_ENABLED flag.

Currently, the callsite of mentioned function is placed incorrectly
within i40e_setup_rx_descriptors() where Rx ring's build skb flag is not
set yet. This causes the XDP_REDIRECT to be partially broken due to
inability to create xdp_frame in the headroom space, as the headroom is
0.

For the record, below is the call graph:

i40e_vsi_open
 i40e_vsi_setup_rx_resources
  i40e_setup_rx_descriptors
   i40e_rx_offset() <-- sets offset to 0 as build_skb flag is set below

 i40e_vsi_configure_rx
  i40e_configure_rx_ring
   set_ring_build_skb_enabled(ring) <-- set build_skb flag

Fix this by moving i40e_rx_offset() to i40e_configure_rx_ring() after
the flag setting.
