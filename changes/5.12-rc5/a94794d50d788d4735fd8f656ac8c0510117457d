btrfs: zoned: calculate allocation offset for conventional zones

Conventional zones do not have a write pointer, so we cannot use it to
determine the allocation offset for sequential allocation if a block
group contains a conventional zone.

But instead, we can consider the end of the highest addressed extent in
the block group for the allocation offset.

For new block group, we cannot calculate the allocation offset by
consulting the extent tree, because it can cause deadlock by taking
extent buffer lock after chunk mutex, which is already taken in
btrfs_make_block_group(). Since it is a new block group anyways, we can
simply set the allocation offset to 0.
