btrfs: zoned: do not use async metadata checksum on zoned filesystems

On zoned filesystems, btrfs uses per-fs zoned_meta_io_lock to serialize
the metadata write IOs.

Even with this serialization, write bios sent from btree_write_cache_pages
can be reordered by async checksum workers as these workers are per CPU
and not per zone.

To preserve write bio ordering, we disable async metadata checksum on a
zoned filesystem. This does not result in lower performance with HDDs as
a single CPU core is fast enough to do checksum for a single zone write
stream with the maximum possible bandwidth of the device. If multiple
zones are being written simultaneously, HDD seek overhead lowers the
achievable maximum bandwidth, resulting again in a per zone checksum
serialization not affecting the performance.
