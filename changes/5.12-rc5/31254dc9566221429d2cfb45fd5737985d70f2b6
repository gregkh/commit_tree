selftests/bpf: Set gopt opt_class to 0 if get tunnel opt failed

When fixing the bpf test_tunnel.sh geneve failure. I only fixed the IPv4
part but forgot the IPv6 issue. Similar with the IPv4 fixes 557c223b643a
("selftests/bpf: No need to drop the packet when there is no geneve opt"),
when there is no tunnel option and bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt() returns error,
there is no need to drop the packets and break all geneve rx traffic.
Just set opt_class to 0 and keep returning TC_ACT_OK at the end.

Fixes: 557c223b643a ("selftests/bpf: No need to drop the packet when there is no geneve opt")
Fixes: 933a741e3b82 ("selftests/bpf: bpf tunnel test.")
