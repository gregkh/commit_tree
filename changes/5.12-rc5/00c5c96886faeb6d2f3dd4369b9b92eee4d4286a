staging: hikey9xx: phy-hi3670-usb3: adjust retry logic

Instead of running a loop up to 100k times, add a small
delay inside it, running it up to 10 times, waiting up
to 100-200 us.

It should be noticed that I don't have the datasheet for
this PHY. So, not sure if this time will cover all
situations.
