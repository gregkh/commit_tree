pinctrl: sunxi: h6-r: Add s_rsb pin functions

As there is an RSB controller in the H6 SoC, there should be some pin
configuration for it. While no such configuration is documented, the
"s_i2c" pins are suspiciously on the "alternate" function 3, with no
primary function 2 given. This suggests the primary function for these
pins is actually RSB, and that is indeed the case.

Add the "s_rsb" pin functions so the RSB controller can be used.
