nvme: allocate the keep alive request using BLK_MQ_REQ_NOWAIT

To avoid an error recovery deadlock where the keep alive work is waiting
for a request and thus can't be flushed to make progress for tearing down
the controller.  Also print the error code returned from
blk_mq_alloc_request to help debugging any future issues in this code.

Based on an earlier patch from Hannes Reinecke <hare@suse.de>.
