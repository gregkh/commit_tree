powerpc/sstep: Fix incorrect return from analyze_instr()

We currently just percolate the return value from analyze_instr()
to the caller of emulate_step(), especially if it is a -1.

For one particular case (opcode = 4) for instructions that aren't
currently emulated, we are returning 'should not be single-stepped'
while we should have returned 0 which says 'did not emulate, may
have to single-step'.
