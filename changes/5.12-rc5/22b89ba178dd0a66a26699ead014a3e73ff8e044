powerpc/sstep: Fix darn emulation

Commit 8813ff49607e ("powerpc/sstep: Check instruction validity
against ISA version before emulation") introduced a proper way to skip
unknown instructions. This makes sure that the same is used for the
darn instruction when the range selection bits have a reserved value.
