KVM: x86/mmu: Store the address space ID in the TDP iterator

Store the address space ID in the TDP iterator so that it can be
retrieved without having to bounce through the root shadow page.  This
streamlines the code and fixes a Sparse warning about not properly using
rcu_dereference() when grabbing the ID from the root on the fly.
