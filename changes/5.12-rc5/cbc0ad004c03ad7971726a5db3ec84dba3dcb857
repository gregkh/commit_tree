dmaengine: fsldma: Fix a resource leak in the remove function

A 'irq_dispose_mapping()' call is missing in the remove function.
Add it.

This is needed to undo the 'irq_of_parse_and_map() call from the probe
function and already part of the error handling path of the probe function.

It was added in the probe function only in commit d3f620b2c4fe ("fsldma:
simplify IRQ probing and handling")
