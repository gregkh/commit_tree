scsi: pmcraid: Fix 'ioarcb' alignment warning

Building with 'make W=1' enables -Wpacked-not-aligned, and this warns about
pmcraid because of incompatible alignment constraints for
pmcraid_passthrough_ioctl_buffer:

drivers/scsi/pmcraid.h:1044:1: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct pmcraid_passthrough_ioctl_buffer' is less than 32 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]
 1044 | } __attribute__ ((packed));
      | ^
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.h:1041:24: warning: 'ioarcb' offset 16 in 'struct pmcraid_passthrough_ioctl_buffer' isn't aligned to 32 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]
 1041 |  struct pmcraid_ioarcb ioarcb;

The inner structure is documented as having 32 byte alignment here, but is
starts at a 16 byte offset in the outer structure, so it's never actually
aligned, as the outer structure is also marked 'packed'.

Lee Jones point this out as one of the last files that need to be changed
before the warning can be enabled by default.

Change the annotations in a way that avoids the warning but leaves the
layout unchanged, by removing the packing on the inner structure and adding
it to the outer one. The one-byte request_buffer[] array should have been a
flexible array member here, which is how I change it to avoid extra padding
from the alignment attribute.
