dmaengine: fsldma: Fix a resource leak in an error handling path of the probe function

In case of error, the previous 'fsl_dma_chan_probe()' calls must be undone
by some 'fsl_dma_chan_remove()', as already done in the remove function.

It was added in the remove function in commit 77cd62e8082b ("fsldma: allow
Freescale Elo DMA driver to be compiled as a module")

Fixes: d3f620b2c4fe ("fsldma: simplify IRQ probing and handling")
