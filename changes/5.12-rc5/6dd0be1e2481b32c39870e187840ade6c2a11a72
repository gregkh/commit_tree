io_uring: replace list with array for compl batch

Reincarnation of an old patch that replaces a list in struct
io_compl_batch with an array. It's needed to avoid hooking requests via
their compl.list, because it won't be always available in the future.

It's also nice to split io_submit_flush_completions() to avoid free
under locks and remove unlock/lock with a long comment describing when
it can be done.
