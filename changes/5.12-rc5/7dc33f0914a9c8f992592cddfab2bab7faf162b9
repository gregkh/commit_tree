ethtool: Expose the number of lanes in use

Currently, ethtool does not expose how many lanes are used when the
link is up.

After adding a possibility to advertise or force a specific number of
lanes, the lanes in use value can be either the maximum width of the port
or below.

Extend ethtool to expose the number of lanes currently in use for
drivers that support it.

For example:

$ ethtool -s swp1 speed 100000 lanes 4
$ ethtool -s swp2 speed 100000 lanes 4
$ ip link set swp1 up
$ ip link set swp2 up
$ ethtool swp1
Settings for swp1:
