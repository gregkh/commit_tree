net/mlx5e: When changing XDP program without reset, take refs for XSK RQs

Each RQ (including XSK RQs) takes a reference to the XDP program. When
an XDP program is attached or detached, the channels and queues are
recreated, however, there is a special flow for changing an active XDP
program to another one. In that flow, channels and queues stay alive,
but the refcounts of the old and new XDP programs are adjusted. This
flow didn't increment refcount by the number of active XSK RQs, and this
commit fixes it.
