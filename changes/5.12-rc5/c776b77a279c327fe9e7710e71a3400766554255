Revert "drivers:tty:pty: Fix a race causing data loss on close"

This reverts commit 33d4ae98859873ddd49e22e4ca724387548b3d89.

	Our SOF/audio CI shows an across-the-board regression when we try v5.12-rc1,
	specifically on pause/resume tests with an interactive terminal running 'aplay
	-i' commands managed by expect to simulate the user pressing the space bar to
	pause/unpause. It turns out the processes are not longer killed and the audio
	devices remain busy (see publicly available test results listed below).

	git bisect points to commit 33d4ae9885987 ("drivers:tty:pty: Fix a race
	causing data loss on close"). Reverting the patch fixes the issue on all test
	devices.

	Further analysis with Corey Minyard points to a problem where a slave tty will
	not get a SIGHUP when the master is closed.

So revert this for now:
