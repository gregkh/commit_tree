drm: rework description of primary and cursor planes

The previous wording could be understood by user-space evelopers as "a
primary/cursor plane is only compatible with a single CRTC" [1].

Reword the planes description to make it clear the DRM-internal
drm_crtc.primary and drm_crtc.cursor planes are for legacy uAPI.
