It is caused by the not-freed kobject of rtrs_srv_sess.  The kobject
embedded in rtrs_srv_sess has ref-counter 2 after calling
process_info_req(). Therefore it must call kobject_put twice.  Currently
it calls kobject_put only once at rtrs_srv_destroy_sess_files because
kobject_del removes the state_in_sysfs flag and then kobject_put in
free_sess() is not called.

This patch moves kobject_del() into free_sess() so that the kobject of
rtrs_srv_sess can be freed. And also this patch adds the missing call of
sysfs_remove_group() to clean-up the sysfs directory.
