net: mscc: ocelot: avoid unneeded "lp" variable in LAG join

The index of the LAG is equal to the logical port ID that all the
physical port members have, which is further equal to the index of the
first physical port that is a member of the LAG.

The code gets a bit carried away with logic like this:

	if (a == b)
		c = a;
	else
		c = b;

which can be simplified, of course, into:

	c = b;

(with a being port, b being lp, c being lag)

This further makes the "lp" variable redundant, since we can use "lag"
everywhere where "lp" (logical port) was used. So instead of a "c = b"
assignment, we can do a complete deletion of b. Only one comment here:

		if (bond_mask) {
			lp = __ffs(bond_mask);
			ocelot->lags[lp] = 0;
		}

lp was clobbered before, because it was used as a temporary variable to
hold the new smallest port ID from the bond. Now that we don't have "lp"
any longer, we'll just avoid the temporary variable and zeroize the
bonding mask directly.
