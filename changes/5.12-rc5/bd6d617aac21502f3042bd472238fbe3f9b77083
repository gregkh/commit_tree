of: property: fw_devlink: Ignore interrupts property for some configs

When CONFIG_OF_IRQ is not defined, it doesn't make sense to parse
interrupts property.

Also, parsing and tracking interrupts property breaks some PPC
devices[1].  But none of the IRQ drivers in PPC seem ready to be
converted to a proper platform (or any bus) driver. So, there's not much
of a point in tracking the interrupts property for CONFIG_PPC. So, let's
stop parsing interrupts for CONFIG_PPC.
