i2c: mlxcpld: Decrease polling time for performance improvement

Decrease polling time 'MLXCPLD_I2C_POLL_TIME' from 2000 usec to 400
usec. It greatly improves performance of I2C transactions.

Reliability of setting polling time to 400 usec has been thoroughly
validated across all the supported systems.
