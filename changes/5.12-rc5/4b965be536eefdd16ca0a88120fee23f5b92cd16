ath11k: Update tx descriptor search index properly

Tx descriptor search index field should be updated with hw peer id
and not by AST Hash as per the HW/FW recommendation. Incorrect search
index causes throughput degradation in all scenario for all the
platforms. so updated the search index field with hw peer id, which
is a common change applicable for all the platforms. Also no need of these
configuration for non station type. seen 10% throughput increase in WDS
traffic with this change.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.4.0.1-01492-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
