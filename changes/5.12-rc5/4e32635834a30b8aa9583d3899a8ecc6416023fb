io_uring: optimise SQPOLL mm/files grabbing

There are two reasons for this. First is to optimise
io_sq_thread_acquire_mm_files() for non-SQPOLL case, which currently do
too many checks and function calls in the hot path, e.g. in
io_init_req().

The second is to not grab mm/files when there are not needed. As
__io_queue_sqe() issues only one request now, we can reuse
io_sq_thread_acquire_mm_files() instead of unconditional acquire
mm/files.
