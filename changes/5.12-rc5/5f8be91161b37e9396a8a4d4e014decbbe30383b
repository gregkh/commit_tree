drm/i915/pps: Reuse POWER_DOMAIN_DISPLAY_CORE in pps_{lock, unlock}

We need a power_domain wakeref in pps_{lock,unlock} to prevent
a race while resetting pps state in intel_power_sequencer_reset().

intel_power_sequencer_reset() need a pps_mutex to access pps_pipe
but it can't grab pps_mutex due to deadlock with power_well
functions are called while holding pps_mutex.
intel_power_sequencer_reset() is called by power_well function
associated with legacy platforms like vlv and chv therefore re-use
the POWER_DOMAIN_DISPLAY_CORE power domain, which only used
by vlv and chv display power domain.

This will avoids the unnecessary noise of unrelated power wells
in pps_{lock,unlock}.
