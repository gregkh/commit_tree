rbtree, perf: Use new rbtree helpers

Reduce rbtree boiler plate by using the new helpers.

One noteworthy change is unification of the various (partial) compare
functions. We construct a subtree match by forcing the sub-order to
always match, see __group_cmp().

Due to 'const' we had to touch cgroup_id().
