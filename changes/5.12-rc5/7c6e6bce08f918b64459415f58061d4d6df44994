can: kvaser_pciefd: Always disable bus load reporting

Under certain circumstances, when switching from Kvaser's linuxcan driver
(kvpciefd) to the SocketCAN driver (kvaser_pciefd), the bus load reporting
is not disabled.
This is flooding the kernel log with prints like:
[3485.574677] kvaser_pciefd 0000:02:00.0: Received unexpected packet type 0x00000009

Always put the controller in the expected state, instead of assuming that
bus load reporting is inactive.

Note: If bus load reporting is enabled when the driver is loaded, you will
      still get a number of bus load packages (and printouts), before it is
      disabled.
