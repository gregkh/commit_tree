drm: Move struct drm_device.hose to legacy section

The field is only relevant for legacy DRM drivers. Its only non-legacy
user in the DRM core is in drm_file.c. This code is now protected by
CONFIG_DRM_LEGACY. Radeon, the only driver that used the field, has been
changed to maintain it's own copy.
