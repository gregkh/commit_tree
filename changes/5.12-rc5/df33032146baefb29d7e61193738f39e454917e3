ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add quirk for the Mele PCG03 Mini PC

Add a quirk for the Mele PCG03 Mini PC, being a Mini PC this device
has no speakers and no internal microphone.

To make matters worse the speaker output pins are shorted (to gnd or
to each other?) and SPKVDD is provided. So trying to output sound on the
speakers leads to shorting SPKVDD, this leads to a power dip after
which the codec is an unknown state. Sometimes it drops of the i2c
bus, sometimes it does still respond to i2c transfers, but is otherwise
not functional. TL;DR: trying to use the speaker outputs on this model
is BAD.

Besides not having speakers / an internal mic, this is a Bay Trail CR
device without a CHAN package in ACPI, so we default to SSP0-AIF2 as
codec connection. But the device is actually using SSP0-AIF1, so we
need to quirk that too.
