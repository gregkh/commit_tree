opp: Defer acquiring the clk until OPPs are added

We acquire the clk at the time the OPP table is allocated, though it
works fine, it is not the best place to do so. One of the main reason
being we may need to acquire it again from dev_pm_opp_set_clkname() if
the platform wants another clock to be acquired instead.

There is also requirement from some of the platforms where they do not
want the OPP core to manage the clock at all.

This patch hence defers acquiring the clk until the time we are certain
about which clk we need to acquire and if we really need to acquire one.
With this commit, the clk will get acquired either from
dev_pm_opp_set_clkname() or while we initialize the OPPs within the
table.
