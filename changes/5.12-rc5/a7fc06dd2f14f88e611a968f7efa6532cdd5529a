KVM: SVM: use .prepare_guest_switch() to handle CPU register save/setup

Currently we save host state like user-visible host MSRs, and do some
initial guest register setup for MSR_TSC_AUX and MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO
in svm_vcpu_load(). Defer this until just before we enter the guest by
moving the handling to kvm_x86_ops.prepare_guest_switch() similarly to
how it is done for the VMX implementation.

Additionally, since handling of saving/restoring host user MSRs is the
same both with/without SEV-ES enabled, move that handling to common
code.
