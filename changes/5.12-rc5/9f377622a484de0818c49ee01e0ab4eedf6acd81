erofs: fix bio->bi_max_vecs behavior change

Martin reported an issue that directory read could be hung on the
latest -rc kernel with some certain image. The root cause is that
commit baa2c7c97153 ("block: set .bi_max_vecs as actual allocated
vector number") changes .bi_max_vecs behavior. bio->bi_max_vecs
is set as actual allocated vector number rather than the requested
number now.

Let's avoid using .bi_max_vecs completely instead.
