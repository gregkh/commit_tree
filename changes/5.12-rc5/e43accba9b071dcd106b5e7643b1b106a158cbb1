psample: Fix user API breakage

Cited commit added a new attribute before the existing group reference
count attribute, thereby changing its value and breaking existing
applications on new kernels.

Before:

 # psample -l
 libpsample ERROR psample_group_foreach: failed to recv message: Operation not supported

After:

 # psample -l
 Group Num       Refcount        Group Seq
 1               1               0

Fix by restoring the value of the old attribute and remove the
misleading comments from the enumerator to avoid future bugs.
