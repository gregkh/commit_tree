block: recalculate segment count for multi-segment discards correctly

When a stacked block device inserts a request into another block device
using blk_insert_cloned_request, the request's nr_phys_segments field gets
recalculated by a call to blk_recalc_rq_segments in
blk_cloned_rq_check_limits. But blk_recalc_rq_segments does not know how to
handle multi-segment discards. For disk types which can handle
multi-segment discards like nvme, this results in discard requests which
claim a single segment when it should report several, triggering a warning
in nvme and causing nvme to fail the discard from the invalid state.

This patch fixes blk_recalc_rq_segments to be aware of devices which can
have multi-segment discards. It calculates the correct discard segment
count by counting the number of bio as each discard bio is considered its
own segment.
