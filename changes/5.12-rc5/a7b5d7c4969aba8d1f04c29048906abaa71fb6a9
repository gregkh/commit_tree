bus: ti-sysc: Fix warning on unbind if reset is not deasserted

We currently get thefollowing on driver unbind if a reset is configured
and asserted:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 993 at drivers/reset/core.c:432 reset_control_assert
...

(unbind_store) from [<c0546bec>] (kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x10c/0x1cc)

Let's fix it by checking the reset status.
