HID: i2c-hid: Reorganize so ACPI and OF are separate modules

This patch rejiggers the i2c-hid code so that the OF (Open Firmware
aka Device Tree) and ACPI support is separated out a bit.  The OF and
ACPI drivers are now separate modules that wrap the core module.

Essentially, what we're doing here:
* Make "power up" and "power down" a function that can be (optionally)
  implemented by a given user of the i2c-hid core.
* The OF and ACPI modules are drivers on their own, so they implement
  probe / remove / suspend / resume / shutdown.  The core code
  provides implementations that OF and ACPI can call into.

We'll organize this so that we now have 3 modules: the old i2c-hid
module becomes the "core" module and two new modules will depend on
it, handling probing the specific device.

As part of this work, we'll remove the i2c-hid "platform data"
concept since it's not needed.
