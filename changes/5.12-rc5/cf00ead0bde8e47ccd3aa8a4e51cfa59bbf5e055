USB: serial: cp210x: fix RTS handling

Clearing TIOCM_RTS should always deassert RTS and setting the same bit
should enable auto-RTS if hardware flow control is enabled.

This allows user space to throttle input directly at the source also
when hardware-assisted flow control is enabled and makes dtr_rts()
always deassert both lines during close (when HUPCL is set).
