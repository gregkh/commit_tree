drm/msm/dp: reset dp controller only at boot up and pm_resume

DP_SW_RESET is the global SW reset that is used to initialize DP
controller. If DP_SW_RESET executed during connection setup,
two HPD related side effects may occurred,
1) pending HPD interrupts cleared unexpected
2) re start debounce logic which trigger another interrupt
This patch only issue DP_SW_RESET at boot up and pm_resume.
This patch also reinit video_comp before configure dp controller
to avoid missing VIDEO_READY interrupt.
