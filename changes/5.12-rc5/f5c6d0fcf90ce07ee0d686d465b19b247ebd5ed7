arm64 module: set plt* section addresses to 0x0

These plt* and .text.ftrace_trampoline sections specified for arm64 have
non-zero addressses. Non-zero section addresses in a relocatable ELF would
confuse GDB when it tries to compute the section offsets and it ends up
printing wrong symbol addresses. Therefore, set them to zero, which mirrors
the change in commit 5d8591bc0fba ("module: set ksymtab/kcrctab* section
addresses to 0x0").
