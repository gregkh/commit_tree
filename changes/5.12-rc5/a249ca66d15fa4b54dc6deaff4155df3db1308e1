soc: ti: omap-prm: Fix reboot issue with invalid pcie reset map for dra7

Yongqin Liu <yongqin.liu@linaro.org> reported an issue where reboot hangs
on beagleboard-x15. This started happening after commit 7078a5ba7a58
("soc: ti: omap-prm: Fix boot time errors for rst_map_012 bits 0 and 1").

We now assert any 012 type resets on init to prevent unconfigured
accelerator MMUs getting enabled on init depending on the bootloader or
kexec configured state.

Turns out that we now also wrongly assert dra7 l3init domain PCIe reset
bits causing a hang during reboot. Let's fix the l3init reset bits to
use a 01 map instead of 012 map. There are only two rstctrl bits and not
three. This is documented in TRM "Table 3-1647. RM_PCIESS_RSTCTRL".
