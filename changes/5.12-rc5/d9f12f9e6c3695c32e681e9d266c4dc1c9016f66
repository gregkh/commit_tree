platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Decouple partner removal

Currently, we return if there is no partner present when
!PD_CTRL_RESP_ENABLED_CONNECTED, without proceeding further. This ties
partner removal to cable removal, whereas the two should be independent.

Update the check to remove a partner if one was registered, but continue
after that instead of returning.
