KVM: x86: Advertise INVPCID by default

Advertise INVPCID by default (if supported by the host kernel) instead
of having both SVM and VMX opt in.  INVPCID was opt in when it was a
VMX only feature so that KVM wouldn't prematurely advertise support
if/when it showed up in the kernel on AMD hardware.
