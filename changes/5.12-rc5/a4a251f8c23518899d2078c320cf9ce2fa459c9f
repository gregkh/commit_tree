usb: xhci: do not perform Soft Retry for some xHCI hosts

On some systems rt2800usb and mt7601u devices are unable to operate since
commit f8f80be501aa ("xhci: Use soft retry to recover faster from
transaction errors")

Seems that some xHCI controllers can not perform Soft Retry correctly,
affecting those devices.

To avoid the problem add xhci->quirks flag that restore pre soft retry
xhci behaviour for affected xHCI controllers. Currently those are
AMD_PROMONTORYA_4 and AMD_PROMONTORYA_2, since it was confirmed
by the users: on those xHCI hosts issue happen and is gone after
disabling Soft Retry.
