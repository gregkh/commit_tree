ASoC: atmel-pdc: Use managed DMA buffer allocation

Instead of manually managing its DMA buffers using
dma_{alloc,free}_coherent() lets the sound core take care of this using
managed buffers.

On one hand this reduces the amount of boiler plate code, but the main
motivation for the change is to use the shared code where possible. This
makes it easier to argue about correctness and that the code does not
contain subtle bugs like data leakage or similar.
