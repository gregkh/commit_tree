blk-settings: align max_sectors on "logical_block_size" boundary

We get I/O errors when we run md-raid1 on the top of dm-integrity on the
top of ramdisk.
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xff00, 0xff
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xff00, 0xff
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xffff, 0x1
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xffff, 0x1
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8048, 0xff
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8147, 0xff
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8246, 0xff
device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8345, 0xbb

The ramdisk device has logical_block_size 512 and max_sectors 255. The
dm-integrity device uses logical_block_size 4096 and it doesn't affect the
"max_sectors" value - thus, it inherits 255 from the ramdisk. So, we have
a device with max_sectors not aligned on logical_block_size.

The md-raid device sees that the underlying leg has max_sectors 255 and it
will split the bios on 255-sector boundary, making the bios unaligned on
logical_block_size.

In order to fix the bug, we round down max_sectors to logical_block_size.
