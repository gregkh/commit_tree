dma-buf: Add debug option

We have too many people abusing the struct page they can get at but
really shouldn't in importers. Aside from that the backing page might
simply not exist (for dynamic p2p mappings) looking at it and using it
e.g. for mmap can also wreak the page handling of the exporter
completely. Importers really must go through the proper interface like
dma_buf_mmap for everything.

I'm semi-tempted to enforce this for dynamic importers since those
really have no excuse at all to break the rules.

Unfortuantely we can't store the right pointers somewhere safe to make
sure we oops on something recognizable, so best is to just wrangle
them a bit by flipping all the bits. At least on x86 kernel addresses
have all their high bits sets and the struct page array is fairly low
in the kernel mapping, so flipping all the bits gives us a very high
pointer in userspace and hence excellent chances for an invalid
dereference.

v2: Add a note to the @map_dma_buf hook that exporters shouldn't do
fancy caching tricks, which would blow up with this address scrambling
trick here (Chris)

Enable by default when CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is enabled.

v3: Only one copy of the mangle/unmangle code (Christian)

v4: #ifdef, not #if (0day)

v5: sg_table can also be an ERR_PTR (Chris, Christian)
