KVM: SVM: remove uneeded fields from host_save_users_msrs

Now that the set of host user MSRs that need to be individually
saved/restored are the same with/without SEV-ES, we can drop the
.sev_es_restored flag and just iterate through the list unconditionally
for both cases. A subsequent patch can then move these loops to a
common path.
