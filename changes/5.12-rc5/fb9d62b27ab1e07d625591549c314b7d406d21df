PM: EM: postpone creating the debugfs dir till fs_initcall

The debugfs directory '/sys/kernel/debug/energy_model' is needed before
the Energy Model registration can happen. With the recent change in
debugfs subsystem it's not allowed to create this directory at early
stage (core_initcall). Thus creating this directory would fail.

Postpone the creation of the EM debug dir to later stage: fs_initcall.

It should be safe since all clients: CPUFreq drivers, Devfreq drivers
will be initialized in later stages.

The custom debug log below prints the time of creation the EM debug dir
at fs_initcall and successful registration of EMs at later stages.

[    1.505717] energy_model: creating rootdir
[    3.698307] cpu cpu0: EM: created perf domain
[    3.709022] cpu cpu1: EM: created perf domain
