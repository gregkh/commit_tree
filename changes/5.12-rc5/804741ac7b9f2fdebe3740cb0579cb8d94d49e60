netsec: restore phy power state after controller reset

Since commit 8e850f25b581 ("net: socionext: Stop PHY before resetting
netsec") netsec_netdev_init() power downs phy before resetting the
controller. However, the state is not restored once the reset is
complete. As a result it is not possible to bring up network on a
platform with Broadcom BCM5482 phy.

Fix the issue by restoring phy power state after controller reset is
complete.
