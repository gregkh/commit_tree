kbuild: lto: fix module versioning

With CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, version information is linked into each
compilation unit that exports symbols. With LTO, we cannot use this
method as all C code is compiled into LLVM bitcode instead. This
change collects symbol versions into .symversions files and merges
them in link-vmlinux.sh where they are all linked into vmlinux.o at
the same time.
