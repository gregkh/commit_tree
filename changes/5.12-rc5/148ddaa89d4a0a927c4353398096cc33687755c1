clk: qcom: gcc-sc7180: Use floor ops for the correct sdcc1 clk

While picking commit a8cd989e1a57 ("mmc: sdhci-msm: Warn about
overclocking SD/MMC") back to my tree I was surprised that it was
reporting warnings.  I thought I fixed those!  Looking closer at the
fix, I see that I totally bungled it (or at least I halfway bungled
it).  The SD card clock got fixed (and that was the one I was really
focused on fixing), but I totally adjusted the wrong clock for eMMC.
Sigh.  Let's fix my dumb mistake.

Now both SD and eMMC have floor for the "apps" clock.

This doesn't matter a lot for the final clock rate for HS400 eMMC but
could matter if someone happens to put some slower eMMC on a sc7180.
We also transition through some of these lower rates sometimes and
having them wrong could cause problems during these transitions.
These were the messages I was seeing at boot:
  mmc1: Card appears overclocked; req 52000000 Hz, actual 100000000 Hz
  mmc1: Card appears overclocked; req 52000000 Hz, actual 100000000 Hz
  mmc1: Card appears overclocked; req 104000000 Hz, actual 192000000 Hz
