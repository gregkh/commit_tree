ia64: mca: allocate early mca with GFP_ATOMIC

The sleep warning happens at early boot right at secondary CPU
activation bootup:

    smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...
    BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at mm/page_alloc.c:4942

    Fixed BSP b0 value from CPU 1

As I understand interrupts are not enabled yet and system has a lot of
memory.  There is little chance to sleep and switch to GFP_ATOMIC should
be a no-op.
