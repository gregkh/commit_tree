modpost: lto: strip .lto from module names

With LTO, everything is compiled into LLVM bitcode, so we have to link
each module into native code before modpost. Kbuild uses the .lto.o
suffix for these files, which also ends up in module information. This
change strips the unnecessary .lto suffix from the module name.
