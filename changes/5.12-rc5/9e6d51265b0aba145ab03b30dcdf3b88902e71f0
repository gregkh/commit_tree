cfg80211: initialize reg_rule in __freq_reg_info()

Sparse started warning on this function because we can potentially
return an uninitialized value.  The reason is that if the caller
passes a min_bw value that is higher then the last value in bws[], we
will not go into the loop and reg_rule will remain initialized.  This
cannot happen because the only caller of this function uses either 1
or 20 in min_bw, but the function will be more robust if we
pre-initialize the value.
