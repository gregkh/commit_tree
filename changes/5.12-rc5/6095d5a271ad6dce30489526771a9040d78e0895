libbpf: Use string table index from index table if needed

For very large ELF objects (with many sections), we could
get special value SHN_XINDEX (65535) for elf object's string
table index - e_shstrndx.

Call elf_getshdrstrndx to get the proper string table index,
instead of reading it directly from ELF header.
