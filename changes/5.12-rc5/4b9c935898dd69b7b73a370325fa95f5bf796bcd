net: dsa: dsa_legacy_fdb_{add,del} can be static

Introduced in commit 37b8da1a3c68 ("net: dsa: Move FDB add/del
implementation inside DSA") in net/dsa/legacy.c, these functions were
moved again to slave.c as part of commit 2a93c1a3651f ("net: dsa: Allow
compiling out legacy support"), before actually deleting net/dsa/slave.c
in 93e86b3bc842 ("net: dsa: Remove legacy probing support"). Along with
that movement there should have been a deletion of the prototypes from
dsa_priv.h, they are not useful.
