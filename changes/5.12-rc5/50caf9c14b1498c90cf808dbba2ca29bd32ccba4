sched: Simplify set_affinity_pending refcounts

Now that we have set_affinity_pending::stop_pending to indicate if a
stopper is in progress, and we have the guarantee that if that stopper
exists, it will (eventually) complete our @pending we can simplify the
refcount scheme by no longer counting the stopper thread.
