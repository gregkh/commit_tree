can: peak_usb: Revert "can: peak_usb: add forgotten supported devices"

In commit 6417f03132a6 ("module: remove never implemented
MODULE_SUPPORTED_DEVICE") the MODULE_SUPPORTED_DEVICE macro was
removed from the kerne entirely. Shortly before this patch was applied
mainline the commit 59ec7b89ed3e ("can: peak_usb: add forgotten
supported devices") was added to net/master. As this would result in a
merge conflict, let's revert this patch.
