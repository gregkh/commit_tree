KVM: x86: Remove misleading DR6/DR7 adjustments from RSM emulation

Drop the DR6/7 volatile+fixed bits adjustments in RSM emulation, which
are redundant and misleading.  The necessary adjustments are made by
kvm_set_dr(), which properly sets the fixed bits that are conditional
on the vCPU model.

Note, KVM incorrectly reads only bits 31:0 of the DR6/7 fields when
emulating RSM on x86-64.  On the plus side for this change, that bug
makes removing "& DRx_VOLATILE" a nop.

No functional change intended.
