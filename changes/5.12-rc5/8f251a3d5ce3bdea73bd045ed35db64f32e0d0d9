hugetlb: convert page_huge_active() HPageMigratable flag

Use the new hugetlb page specific flag HPageMigratable to replace the
page_huge_active interfaces.  By it's name, page_huge_active implied that
a huge page was on the active list.  However, that is not really what code
checking the flag wanted to know.  It really wanted to determine if the
huge page could be migrated.  This happens when the page is actually added
to the page cache and/or task page table.  This is the reasoning behind
the name change.

The VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() calls in the *_huge_active() interfaces are not
really necessary as we KNOW the page is a hugetlb page.  Therefore, they
are removed.

The routine page_huge_active checked for PageHeadHuge before testing the
active bit.  This is unnecessary in the case where we hold a reference or
lock and know it is a hugetlb head page.  page_huge_active is also called
without holding a reference or lock (scan_movable_pages), and can race
with code freeing the page.  The extra check in page_huge_active shortened
the race window, but did not prevent the race.  Offline code calling
scan_movable_pages already deals with these races, so removing the check
is acceptable.  Add comment to racy code.
