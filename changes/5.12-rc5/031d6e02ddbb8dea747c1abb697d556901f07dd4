bpf: Run sleepable programs with migration disabled

In older non-RT kernels migrate_disable() was the same as preempt_disable().
Since commit 74d862b682f5 ("sched: Make migrate_disable/enable() independent of RT")
migrate_disable() is real and doesn't prevent sleeping.

Running sleepable programs with migration disabled allows to add support for
program stats and per-cpu maps later.
