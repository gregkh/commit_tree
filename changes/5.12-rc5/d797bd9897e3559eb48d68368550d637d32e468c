bcache: Give btree_io_wq correct semantics again

Before killing `btree_io_wq`, the queue was allocated using
`create_singlethread_workqueue()` which has `WQ_MEM_RECLAIM`. After
killing it, it no longer had this property but `system_wq` is not
single threaded.

Let's combine both worlds and make it multi threaded but able to
reclaim memory.
