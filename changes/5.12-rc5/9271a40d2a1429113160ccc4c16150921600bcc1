lockdep/selftest: Add wait context selftests

These tests are added for two purposes:

*	Test the implementation of wait context checks and related
	annotations.

*	Semi-document the rules for wait context nesting when
	PROVE_RAW_LOCK_NESTING=y.

The test cases are only avaible for PROVE_RAW_LOCK_NESTING=y, as wait
context checking makes more sense for that configuration.
