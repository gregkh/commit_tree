hv_netvsc: Process NETDEV_GOING_DOWN on VF hot remove

On VF hot remove, NETDEV_GOING_DOWN is sent to notify the VF is about to
go down. At this time, the VF is still sending/receiving traffic and we
request the VSP to switch datapath.

On completion, the datapath is switched to synthetic and we can proceed
with VF hot remove.
