soc: qcom: llcc-qcom: Extract major hardware version

The major hardware version of the LLCC IP is encoded in its
LLCC_COMMON_HW_INFO register. Extract the version and cache it in the
driver data so that it can be used to implement version specific
functionality like enabling Write sub cache for given SCID.
