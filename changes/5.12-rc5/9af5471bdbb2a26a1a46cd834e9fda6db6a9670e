KVM: x86: introduce definitions to support static calls for kvm_x86_ops

Use static calls to improve kvm_x86_ops performance. Introduce the
definitions that will be used by a subsequent patch to actualize the
savings. Add a new kvm-x86-ops.h header that can be used for the
definition of static calls. This header is also intended to be
used to simplify the defition of svm_kvm_ops and vmx_x86_ops.

Note that all functions in kvm_x86_ops are covered here except for
'pmu_ops' and 'nested ops'. I think they can be covered by static
calls in a simlilar manner, but were omitted from this series to
reduce scope and because I don't think they have as large of a
performance impact.
