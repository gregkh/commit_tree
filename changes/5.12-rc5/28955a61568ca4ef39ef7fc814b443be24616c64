media: v4l2-dev/event: add v4l2_event_wake_all()

When unregistering a V4L2 device node, make sure any filehandles
that are waiting for an event are woken up.

Add v4l2_event_wake_all() to v4l2-event.c and call it from
video_unregister_device().

Otherwise userspace might never know that a device node was removed.

[hverkuil: checkpatch: replaced 'if (vdev == NULL)' by 'if (!vdev)']
