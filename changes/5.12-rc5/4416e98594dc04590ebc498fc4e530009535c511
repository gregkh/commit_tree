atm: idt77252: fix null-ptr-dereference

this one is similar to the phy_data allocation fix in uPD98402, the
driver allocate the idt77105_priv and store to dev_data but later
dereference using dev->dev_data, which will cause null-ptr-dereference.

fix this issue by changing dev_data to phy_data so that PRIV(dev) can
work correctly.
