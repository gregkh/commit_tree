bpf, selftests: Fix up some test_verifier cases for unprivileged

Fix up test_verifier error messages for the case where the original error
message changed, or for the case where pointer alu errors differ between
privileged and unprivileged tests. Also, add alternative tests for keeping
coverage of the original verifier rejection error message (fp alu), and
newly reject map_ptr += rX where rX == 0 given we now forbid alu on these
types for unprivileged. All test_verifier cases pass after the change. The
test case fixups were kept separate to ease backporting of core changes.
