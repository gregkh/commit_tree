ia64: remove unneeded header includes from <asm/mca.h>

<asm/mca.h> includes too many unneeded headers.

This commit cuts off a lot of header includes.

What we need to include are:

 - <linux/percpu.h> for DECLARE_PER_CPU(u64, ia64_mca_pal_base)
 - <linux/threads.h> for NR_CPUS
 - <linux/types.h> for u8, u64, size_t, etc.
 - <asm/ptrace.h> for KERNEL_STACK_SIZE

The other header includes are actually unneeded.

<asm/mca.h> previously included 436 headers, and now it includes
only 138. I confirmed <asm/mca.h> is still self-contained.
