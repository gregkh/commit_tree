ARM: OMAP2+: Fix smartreflex init regression after dropping legacy data

When I dropped legacy data for omap4 and dra7 smartreflex in favor of
device tree based data, it seems I only testd for the "SmartReflex Class3
initialized" line in dmesg. I missed the fact that there is also
omap_devinit_smartreflex() that happens later, and now it produces an
error on boot for "No Voltage table for the corresponding vdd. Cannot
create debugfs entries for n-values".

This happens as we no longer have the smartreflex instance legacy data,
and have not yet moved completely to device tree based booting for the
driver. Let's fix the issue by changing the smartreflex init to use names.
This should all eventually go away in favor of doing the init in the
driver based on devicetree compatible value.

Note that dra7xx_init_early() is not calling any voltage domain init like
omap54xx_voltagedomains_init(), or a dra7 specific voltagedomains init.
This means that on dra7 smartreflex is still not fully initialized, and
also seems to be missing the related devicetree nodes.
