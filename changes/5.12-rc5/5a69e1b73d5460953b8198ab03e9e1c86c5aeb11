crypto: arm64/sha1-ce - simplify NEON yield

Instead of calling into kernel_neon_end() and kernel_neon_begin() (and
potentially into schedule()) from the assembler code when running in
task mode and a reschedule is pending, perform only the preempt count
check in assembler, but simply return early in this case, and let the C
code deal with the consequences.

This reverts commit 7df8d164753e6e6f229b72767595072bc6a71f48.
