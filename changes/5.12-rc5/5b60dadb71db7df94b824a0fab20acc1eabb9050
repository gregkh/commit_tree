net: dsa: tag_dsa: Support reception of packets from LAG devices

Packets ingressing on a LAG that egress on the CPU port, which are not
classified as management, will have a FORWARD tag that does not
contain the normal source device/port tuple. Instead the trunk bit
will be set, and the port field holds the LAG id.

Since the exact source port information is not available in the tag,
frames are injected directly on the LAG interface and thus do never
pass through any DSA port interface on ingress.

Management frames (TO_CPU) are not affected and will pass through the
DSA port interface as usual.
