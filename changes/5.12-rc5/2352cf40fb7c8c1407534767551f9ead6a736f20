staging: qlge: support force_coredump option for devlink health dump

With force_coredump module parameter set, devlink health dump will
reset the MPI RISC first which takes 5 secs to be finished.

Note that only NIC function that owns the firmware can do the
force_dumping. Otherwise devlink will receive an EPERM error.
