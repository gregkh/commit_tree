signal: don't allow sending any signals to PF_IO_WORKER threads

They don't take signals individually, and even if they share signals with
the parent task, don't allow them to be delivered through the worker
thread. Linux does allow this kind of behavior for regular threads, but
it's really a compatability thing that we need not care about for the IO
threads.
