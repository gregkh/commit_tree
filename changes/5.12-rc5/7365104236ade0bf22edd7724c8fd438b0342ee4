btrfs: zoned: defer loading zone info after opening trees

This is a preparation patch to implement zone emulation on a regular
device.

To emulate a zoned filesystem on a regular (non-zoned) device, we need to
decide an emulated zone size. Instead of making it a compile-time static
value, we'll make it configurable at mkfs time. Since we have one zone ==
one device extent restriction, we can determine the emulated zone size
from the size of a device extent. We can extend btrfs_get_dev_zone_info()
to show a regular device filled with conventional zones once the zone size
is decided.

The current call site of btrfs_get_dev_zone_info() during the mount process
is earlier than loading the file system trees so that we don't know the
size of a device extent at this point. Thus we can't slice a regular device
to conventional zones.

This patch introduces btrfs_get_dev_zone_info_all_devices to load the zone
info for all the devices. And, it places this function in open_ctree()
after loading the trees.
