btrfs: zoned: disallow fitrim on zoned filesystems

The implementation of fitrim depends on space cache, which is not used
and disabled for zoned extent allocator. So the current code does not
work with zoned filesystem.

In the future, we can implement fitrim for zoned filesystems by enabling
space cache (but, only for fitrim) or scanning the extent tree at fitrim
time.  For now, disallow fitrim on zoned filesystems.
