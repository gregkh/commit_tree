sch_htb: Fix offload cleanup in htb_destroy on htb_init failure

htb_init may fail to do the offload if it's not supported or if a
runtime error happens when allocating direct qdiscs. In those cases
TC_HTB_CREATE command is not sent to the driver, however, htb_destroy
gets called anyway and attempts to send TC_HTB_DESTROY.

It shouldn't happen, because the driver didn't receive TC_HTB_CREATE,
and also because the driver may not support ndo_setup_tc at all, while
q->offload is true, and htb_destroy mistakenly thinks the offload is
supported. Trying to call ndo_setup_tc in the latter case will lead to a
NULL pointer dereference.

This commit fixes the issues with htb_destroy by deferring assignment of
q->offload until after the TC_HTB_CREATE command. The necessary cleanup
of the offload entities is already done in htb_init.
