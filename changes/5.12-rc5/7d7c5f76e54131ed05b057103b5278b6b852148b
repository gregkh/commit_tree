KVM: x86/xen: Fix return code when clearing vcpu_info and vcpu_time_info

When clearing the per-vCPU shared regions, set the return value to zero
to indicate success. This was causing spurious errors to be returned to
userspace on soft reset.

Also add a paranoid BUILD_BUG_ON() for compat structure compatibility.
