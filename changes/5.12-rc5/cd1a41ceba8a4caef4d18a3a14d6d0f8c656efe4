softirq: Move __ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ to Kconfig

To prepare for inlining do_softirq_own_stack() replace
__ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ with a Kconfig switch and select it in the affected
architectures.

This allows in the next step to move the function prototype and the inline
stub into a seperate asm-generic header file which is required to avoid
include recursion.
