net: qualcomm: rmnet: Fix rx_handler for non-linear skbs

There is no guarantee that rmnet rx_handler is only fed with linear
skbs, but current rmnet implementation does not check that, leading
to crash in case of non linear skbs processed as linear ones.

Fix that by ensuring skb linearization before processing.
