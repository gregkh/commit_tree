xen/x86: make XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG_LIMIT depend on MEMORY_HOTPLUG

The Xen memory hotplug limit should depend on the memory hotplug
generic option, rather than the Xen balloon configuration. It's
possible to have a kernel with generic memory hotplug enabled, but
without Xen balloon enabled, at which point memory hotplug won't work
correctly due to the size limitation of the p2m.

Rename the option to XEN_MEMORY_HOTPLUG_LIMIT since it's no longer
tied to ballooning.
