s390/qdio: remove 'merge_pending' mechanism

For non-QEBSM devices, get_buf_states() merges PENDING and EMPTY buffers
into a single group of finished buffers. To allow the upper-layer driver
to differentiate between the two states, qdio_check_pending() looks at
each buffer's state again and sets the sbal_state flag to
QDIO_OUTBUF_STATE_FLAG_PENDING accordingly.

So effectively we're spending overhead on _every_ Output Queue
inspection, just to avoid some additional TX completion calls in case
a group of buffers has completed with mixed EMPTY / PENDING state.
Given that PENDING buffers should rarely occur, this is a bad trade-off.
In particular so as the additional checks in get_buf_states() affect
_all_ device types (even those that don't use the PENDING state).

Rip it all out, and just report the PENDING completions separately as
we already do for QEBSM devices.
