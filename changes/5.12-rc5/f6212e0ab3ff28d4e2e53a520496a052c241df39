ASoC: wm_adsp: Use snd_ctl_elem_type_t for control types

Sparse will complain about trying to convert between values declared
as snd_ctl_elem_type_t and other types. This patch converts to
consistently use snd_ctl_elem_type_t for control type values. A __force
cast is needed in a couple of cases where the control type value is
parsed out of a DSP data block.
