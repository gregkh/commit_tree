microblaze: Fix built-in DTB alignment to be 8-byte aligned

Commit 79edff12060f ("scripts/dtc: Update to upstream version
v1.6.0-51-g183df9e9c2b9") broke booting on Microblaze systems depending on
the build. The problem is libfdt gained an 8-byte starting alignment check,
but the Microblaze built-in DTB area is only 4-byte aligned. This affected
not just built-in DTBs as bootloader passed DTBs are copied into the
built-in DTB region.

Other arches using built-in DTBs use a common linker macro which has
sufficient alignment.
