perf intel-pt: Split VM-Entry and VM-Exit branches

Events record a single cpumode so the tools cannot handle a branch from
the host machine to a virtual machine, or vice versa. Split it in two so
that each branch can have a different cpumode.

  E.g.		host ip -> guest ip

  becomes:	host ip -> 0
		      0 -> guest ip
