net: use the new dev_page_is_reusable() instead of private versions

Now we can remove a bunch of identical functions from the drivers and
make them use common dev_page_is_reusable(). All {,un}likely() checks
are omitted since it's already present in this helper.
Also update some comments near the call sites.
