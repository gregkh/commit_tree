cifs: revalidate mapping when we open files for SMB1 POSIX

RHBZ: 1933527

Under SMB1 + POSIX, if an inode is reused on a server after we have read and
cached a part of a file, when we then open the new file with the
re-cycled inode there is a chance that we may serve the old data out of cache
to the application.
This only happens for SMB1 (deprecated) and when posix are used.
The simplest solution to avoid this race is to force a revalidate
on smb1-posix open.
