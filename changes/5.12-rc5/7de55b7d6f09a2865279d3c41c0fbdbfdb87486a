block: support zone append bvecs

Christoph reported that we'll likely trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE() checking
that we're not submitting a bvec with REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND in
bio_iov_iter_get_pages() some time ago using zoned btrfs, but I couldn't
reproduce it back then.

Now Naohiro was able to trigger the bug as well with xfstests generic/095
on a zoned btrfs.

There is nothing that prevents bvec submissions via REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND if
the hardware's zone append limit is met.
