ALSA: fireface: fix to parse sync status register of latter protocol

Fireface UCX, UFX, and FF802 are categorized for latter protocol of the
series. Current support for FF802 (and UFX) includes failure to parse
sync status register and results in EIO.

Further investigation figures out that the content of register differs
depending on models. This commit adds tables specific to FF802 and UFX
to fix it.
