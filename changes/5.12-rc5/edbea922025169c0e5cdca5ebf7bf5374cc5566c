veth: Store queue_mapping independently of XDP prog presence

Currently, veth_xmit() would call the skb_record_rx_queue() only when
there is XDP program loaded on peer interface in native mode.

If peer has XDP prog in generic mode, then netif_receive_generic_xdp()
has a call to netif_get_rxqueue(skb), so for multi-queue veth it will
not be possible to grab a correct rxq.

To fix that, store queue_mapping independently of XDP prog presence on
peer interface.
