KVM: VMX: Dynamically enable/disable PML based on memslot dirty logging

Currently, if enable_pml=1 PML remains enabled for the entire lifetime
of the VM irrespective of whether dirty logging is enable or disabled.
When dirty logging is disabled, all the pages of the VM are manually
marked dirty, so that PML is effectively non-operational.  Setting
the dirty bits is an expensive operation which can cause severe MMU
lock contention in a performance sensitive path when dirty logging is
disabled after a failed or canceled live migration.

Manually setting dirty bits also fails to prevent PML activity if some
code path clears dirty bits, which can incur unnecessary VM-Exits.

In order to avoid this extra overhead, dynamically enable/disable PML
when dirty logging gets turned on/off for the first/last memslot.
