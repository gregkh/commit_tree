fs/cachefiles: Remove wait_bit_key layout dependency

Cachefiles was relying on wait_page_key and wait_bit_key being the
same layout, which is fragile.  Now that wait_page_key is exposed in
the pagemap.h header, we can remove that fragility

A comment on the need to maintain structure layout equivalence was added by
Linus[1] and that is no longer applicable.
