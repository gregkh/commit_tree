perf pmu: Validate raw event with sysfs exported format bits

A raw PMU event (eventsel+umask) in the form of rNNN is supported
by perf but lacks of checking for the validity of raw encoding.

For example, bit 16 and bit 17 are not valid on KBL but perf doesn't
report warning when encoding with these bits.

Before:

  # ./perf stat -e cpu/r031234/ -a -- sleep 1

   Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                   0      cpu/r031234/

         1.003798924 seconds time elapsed

It may silently measure the wrong event!

The kernel supported bits have been exported through
/sys/devices/<pmu>/format/. Perf collects the information to
'struct perf_pmu_format' and links it to 'pmu->format' list.

The 'struct perf_pmu_format' has a bitmap which records the
valid bits for this format. For example,

  root@kbl-ppc:/sys/devices/cpu/format# cat umask
  config:8-15

The valid bits (bit8-bit15) are recorded in bitmap of format 'umask'.

We collect total valid bits of all formats, save to a local variable
'masks' and reverse it. Now '~masks' represents total invalid bits.

bits = config & ~masks;

The set bits in 'bits' indicate the invalid bits used in config.
Finally we use bitmap_scnprintf to report the invalid bits.

Some architectures may not export supported bits through sysfs,
so if masks is 0, perf_pmu__warn_invalid_config directly returns.

After:

Single event without name:

  # ./perf stat -e cpu/r031234/ -a -- sleep 1
  WARNING: event 'N/A' not valid (bits 16-17 of config '31234' not supported by kernel)!

   Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                   0      cpu/r031234/

         1.001597373 seconds time elapsed

Multiple events with names:

  # ./perf stat -e cpu/rf01234,name=aaa/,cpu/r031234,name=bbb/ -a -- sleep 1
  WARNING: event 'aaa' not valid (bits 20,22 of config 'f01234' not supported by kernel)!
  WARNING: event 'bbb' not valid (bits 16-17 of config '31234' not supported by kernel)!

   Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                   0      aaa
                   0      bbb

         1.001573787 seconds time elapsed

Warnings are reported for invalid bits.
