KVM: arm64: Make gen-hyprel endianness agnostic

gen-hyprel is, for better or worse, a native-endian program:
it assumes that the ELF data structures are in the host's
endianness, and even assumes that the compiled kernel is
little-endian in one particular case.

None of these assumptions hold true though: people actually build
(use?) BE arm64 kernels, and seem to avoid doing so on BE hosts.
Madness!

In order to solve this, wrap each access to the ELF data structures
with the required byte-swapping magic. This requires to obtain
the kernel data structure, and provide per-endianess wrappers.

This result in a kernel that links and even boots in a model.
