powerpc/sstep: Fix VSX instruction emulation

Commit af99da74333b ("powerpc/sstep: Support VSX vector paired storage
access instructions") added loading and storing 32 word long data into
adjacent VSRs. However the calculation used to determine if two VSRs
needed to be loaded/stored inadvertently prevented the load/storing
taking place for instructions with a data length less than 16 words.

This causes the emulation to not function correctly, which can be seen
by the alignment_handler selftest:

$ ./alignment_handler

Fix this by making sure all VSX instruction emulation correctly
load/store from the VSRs.
