drm/i915/gt: Use virtual_engine during execlists_dequeue

Rather than going back and forth between the rb_node entry and the
virtual_engine type, store the ve local and reuse it. As the
container_of conversion from rb_node to virtual_engine requires a
variable offset, performing that conversion just once shaves off a bit
of code.

v2: Keep a single virtual engine lookup, for typical use.
