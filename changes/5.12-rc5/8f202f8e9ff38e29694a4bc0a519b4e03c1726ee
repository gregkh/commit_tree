media: v4l: async: Fix kerneldoc documentation for async functions

Fix kerneldoc documentation for functions that add async sub-devices to
notifiers. The functions themselves were improved recently but that left
issues with the kerneldoc documentation. Fix them now.

Also remove underscores from macro argument names.
