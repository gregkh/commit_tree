kernel: stop masking signals in create_io_thread()

This is racy - move the blocking into when the task is created and
we're marking it as PF_IO_WORKER anyway. The IO threads are now
prepared to handle signals like SIGSTOP as well, so clear that from
the mask to allow proper stopping of IO threads.
