soundwire: bus: use sdw_update_no_pm when initializing a device

When a Slave device is resumed, it may resume the bus and restart the
enumeration. During that process, we absolutely don't want to call
regular read/write routines which will wait for the resume to
complete, otherwise a deadlock occurs.
