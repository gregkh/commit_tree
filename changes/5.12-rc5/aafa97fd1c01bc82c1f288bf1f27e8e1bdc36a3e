KVM: x86: hyper-v: Rename vcpu_to_stimer()/stimer_to_vcpu()

vcpu_to_stimers()'s argument is almost always 'vcpu' so there's no need to
have an additional prefix. Also, this makes the naming more consistent with
to_hv_vcpu()/to_hv_synic().

Rename stimer_to_vcpu() to hv_stimer_to_vcpu() for consitency.

No functional change intended.
