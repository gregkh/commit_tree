powerpc/mm: Enable compound page check for both THP and HugeTLB

THP config results in compound pages. Make sure the kernel enables
the PageCompound() check with CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE disabled and
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE enabled.

This makes sure we correctly flush the icache with THP pages.
flush_dcache_icache_page only matter for platforms that don't support
COHERENT_ICACHE.
