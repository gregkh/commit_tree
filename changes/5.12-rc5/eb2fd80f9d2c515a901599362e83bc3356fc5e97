block, bfq: replace mechanism for evaluating I/O intensity

Some BFQ mechanisms make their decisions on a bfq_queue basing also on
whether the bfq_queue is I/O bound. In this respect, the current logic
for evaluating whether a bfq_queue is I/O bound is rather rough. This
commits replaces this logic with a more effective one.

The new logic measures the percentage of time during which a bfq_queue
is active, and marks the bfq_queue as I/O bound if the latter if this
percentage is above a fixed threshold.
