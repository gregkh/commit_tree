KVM: Expose AVX_VNNI instruction to guset

Expose AVX (VEX-encoded) versions of the Vector Neural Network
Instructions to guest.

The bit definition:
CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=1):EAX[bit 4] AVX_VNNI

The following instructions are available when this feature is
present in the guest.
  1. VPDPBUS: Multiply and Add Unsigned and Signed Bytes
  2. VPDPBUSDS: Multiply and Add Unsigned and Signed Bytes with Saturation
  3. VPDPWSSD: Multiply and Add Signed Word Integers
  4. VPDPWSSDS: Multiply and Add Signed Integers with Saturation

This instruction is currently documented in the latest "extensions"
