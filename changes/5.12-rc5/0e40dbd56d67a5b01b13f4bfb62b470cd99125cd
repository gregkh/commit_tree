mt7601u: process URBs in status EPROTO properly

When the usb device being plugged out, before the usb_driver:disconnect
called by e.g workqueue, it is possible that some URBs are still in
processing, and being marked as EPROTO in host controller.

Those URBs should not be scheduled in complete_rx callback function to
get further processing.
