net: stmmac: fix wrongly set buffer2 valid when sph unsupport

In current driver, buffer2 available only when hardware supports split
header. Wrongly set buffer2 valid in stmmac_rx_refill when refill buffer
address. You can see that desc3 is 0x81000000 after initialization, but
turn out to be 0x83000000 after refill.
