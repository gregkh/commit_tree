kgdb: fix to kill breakpoints on initmem after boot

Currently breakpoints in kernel .init.text section are not handled
correctly while allowing to remove them even after corresponding pages
have been freed.

Fix it via killing .init.text section breakpoints just prior to initmem
pages being freed.

Doug: "HW breakpoints aren't handled by this patch but it's probably
not such a big deal".
