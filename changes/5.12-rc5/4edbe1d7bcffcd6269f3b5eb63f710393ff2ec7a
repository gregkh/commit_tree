dm ioctl: fix out of bounds array access when no devices

If there are not any dm devices, we need to zero the "dev" argument in
the first structure dm_name_list. However, this can cause out of
bounds write, because the "needed" variable is zero and len may be
less than eight.

Fix this bug by reporting DM_BUFFER_FULL_FLAG if the result buffer is
too small to hold the "nl->dev" value.
