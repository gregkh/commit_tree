net/bonding: Declare TLS RX device offload support

Following the description in previous patch (for TX):
As the bond interface is being bypassed by the TLS module, interacting
directly against the lower devs, there is no way for the bond interface
to disable its device offload capabilities, as long as the mode/policy
config allows it.
Hence, the feature flag is not directly controllable, but just reflects
the offload status based on the logic under bond_sk_check().

Here we just declare RX device offload support, and expose it via the
NETIF_F_HW_TLS_RX flag.
