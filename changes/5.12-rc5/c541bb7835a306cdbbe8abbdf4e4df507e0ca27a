sched/core: Update task_prio() function header

The description of the RT offset and the values for 'normal' tasks needs
update. Moreover there are DL tasks now.
task_prio() has to stay like it is to guarantee compatibility with the
/proc/<pid>/stat priority field:

  # cat /proc/<pid>/stat | awk '{ print $18; }'
