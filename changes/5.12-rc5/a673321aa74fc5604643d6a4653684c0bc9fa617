selftests: mptcp: Restore packet capture option in join tests

The join self tests previously used the '-c' command line option to
enable creation of pcap files for the tests that run, but the change to
allow running a subset of the join tests made overlapping use of that
option.

Restore the capture functionality with '-c' and move the syncookie test
option to '-k'.
