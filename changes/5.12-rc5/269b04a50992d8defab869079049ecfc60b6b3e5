platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Update Kconfig

The intel_pmc_core driver is mostly used as a debugging driver for Intel
platforms that support SLPS0 (S0ix). But the driver may also be used to
communicate actions to the PMC in order to ensure transition to SLPS0 on
some systems and architectures. As such the driver should be built on all
platforms it supports. Indicate this in the Kconfig. Also update the list
of supported features.
