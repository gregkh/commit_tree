usb: xhci: Fix ASMedia ASM1042A and ASM3242 DMA addressing

I've confirmed that both the ASMedia ASM1042A and ASM3242 have the same
problem as the ASM1142 and ASM2142/ASM3142, where they lose some of the
upper bits of 64-bit DMA addresses. As with the other chips, this can
cause problems on systems where the upper bits matter, and adding the
XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT quirk completely fixes the issue.
