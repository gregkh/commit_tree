thermal: power allocator: fail binding for non-power actor devices

The thermal zone can have cooling devices which are missing power actor
API. This could be due to missing Energy Model for devfreq or cpufreq
cooling device. In this case it is safe to fail the binding rather than
trying to workaround and control the temperature in such thermal zone.
