platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Don't register keyboard_lang unnecessarily

All recent ThinkPad BIOS-es support the GSKL method used to query the
keyboard-layout used by the ECFW for the SHIFT + other-key key-press
emulation for special keys such as e.g. the '=', '(' and ')' keys
above the numpad on 15" models.

So just checking for the method is not a good indicator of the
model supporting getting/setting the keyboard_lang.

On models where this is not supported GSKL succeeds, but it returns
METHOD_ERR in the returned integer to indicate that this is not
supported on this model.

Add a check for METHOD_ERR and return -ENODEV if it is set to
avoid registering a non-working keyboard_lang sysfs-attr on models
where this is not supported.
