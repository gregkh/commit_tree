mm: Close race in generic_access_phys

Way back it was a reasonable assumptions that iomem mappings never
change the pfn range they point at. But this has changed:

- gpu drivers dynamically manage their memory nowadays, invalidating
  ptes with unmap_mapping_range when buffers get moved

- contiguous dma allocations have moved from dedicated carvetouts to
  cma regions. This means if we miss the unmap the pfn might contain
  pagecache or anon memory (well anything allocated with GFP_MOVEABLE)

- even /dev/mem now invalidates mappings when the kernel requests that
  iomem region when CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM is set, see 3234ac664a87
  ("/dev/mem: Revoke mappings when a driver claims the region")

Accessing pfns obtained from ptes without holding all the locks is
therefore no longer a good idea. Fix this.

Since ioremap might need to manipulate pagetables too we need to drop
the pt lock and have a retry loop if we raced.

While at it, also add kerneldoc and improve the comment for the
vma_ops->access function. It's for accessing, not for moving the
memory from iomem to system memory, as the old comment seemed to
suggest.
