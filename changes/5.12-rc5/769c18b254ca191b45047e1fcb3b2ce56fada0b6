bpf: Change inode_storage's lookup_elem return value from NULL to -EBADF

bpf_fd_inode_storage_lookup_elem() returned NULL when getting a bad FD,
which caused -ENOENT in bpf_map_copy_value. -EBADF error is better than
-ENOENT for a bad FD behaviour.

The patch was partially contributed by CyberArk Software, Inc.
