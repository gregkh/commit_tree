xhci: use xhci_td_cleanup() helper when giving back cancelled URBs

use the existing xhci_td_cleanup() to give back cancelled TDs when a
ring is stopped.

A minor change to make sure we don't try to remove an already removed
td from the list is needed as cancelled TDs are already removed from the
td_list immediatelty when it's cancelled.
