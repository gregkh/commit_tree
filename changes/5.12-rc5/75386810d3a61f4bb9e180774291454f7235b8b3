mtd: spi-nor: sst: Add support for Global Unlock on sst26vf

Even if sst26vf shares the SPINOR_OP_GBULK opcode with
Macronix (ex. MX25U12835F) and Winbound (ex. W25Q128FV),
it has its own Individual Block Protection scheme, which
is also capable to read-lock individual parameter blocks.
Thus the sst26vf's Individual Block Protection scheme will
reside in the sst.c manufacturer driver.

Add support to unlock the entire flash memory. The device
is write-protected by default after a power-on reset cycle
(volatile software protection), in order to avoid inadvertent
writes during power-up. Could do an erase, write, read back,
and compare when MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE_ON_VOLATILE=y.
