xfs: fix an ABBA deadlock in xfs_rename

When overlayfs is running on top of xfs and the user unlinks a file in
the overlay, overlayfs will create a whiteout inode and ask xfs to
"rename" the whiteout file atop the one being unlinked.  If the file
being unlinked loses its one nlink, we then have to put the inode on the
unlinked list.

This requires us to grab the AGI buffer of the whiteout inode to take it
off the unlinked list (which is where whiteouts are created) and to grab
the AGI buffer of the file being deleted.  If the whiteout was created
in a higher numbered AG than the file being deleted, we'll lock the AGIs
in the wrong order and deadlock.

Therefore, grab all the AGI locks we think we'll need ahead of time, and
in order of increasing AG number per the locking rules.
