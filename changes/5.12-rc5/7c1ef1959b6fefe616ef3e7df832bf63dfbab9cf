net/mlx5: SF, do not use ecpu bit for vhca state processing

Device firmware doesn't handle ecpu bit for vhca state processing
events and commands. Instead device firmware refers to the unique
function id to distinguish SF of different PCI functions.

When ecpu bit is used, firmware returns a syndrome.

mlx5_cmd_check:780:(pid 872): MODIFY_VHCA_STATE(0xb0e) op_mod(0x0) failed, status bad parameter(0x3), syndrome (0x263211)
mlx5_sf_dev_table_create:248:(pid 872): SF DEV table create err = -22

Hence, avoid using ecpu bit.
