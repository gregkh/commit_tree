cgroup: fix an off-by-one bug which may trigger BUG_ON()

The 3rd parameter of flex_array_prealloc() is the number of elements,
not the index of the last element.

The effect of the bug is, when opening cgroup.procs, a flex array will
be allocated and all elements of the array is allocated with
GFP_KERNEL flag, but the last one is GFP_ATOMIC, and if we fail to
allocate memory for it, it'll trigger a BUG_ON().
