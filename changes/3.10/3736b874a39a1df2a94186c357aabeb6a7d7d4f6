KVM: s390: make if statements in lpsw/lpswe handlers readable

Being unable to parse the 5- and 8-line if statements I had to split them
to be able to make any sense of them and verify that they match the
architecture.
So change the code since I guess that other people will also have a hard
time parsing such long conditional statements with line breaks.

Introduce a common is_valid_psw() function which does all the checks needed.
In case of lpsw (64 bit psw -> 128 bit psw conversion) it will do some not
needed additional checks, since a couple of bits can't be set anyway, but
that doesn't hurt.
