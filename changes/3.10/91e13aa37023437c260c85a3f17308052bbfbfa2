ACPI: video: correct acpi_video_bus_add error processing

acpi_video_bus_get_devices() may fail due to some video output device
doesn't have the _ADR method, and in this case, the error processing
is to simply free the video structure in acpi_video_bus_add(), while
leaving those already registered video output devices in the wild,
which means for some video output device, we have already registered
a backlight interface and installed a notification handler for it.
So it can happen when user is using this system, on hotkey pressing,
the notification handler will send a keycode through a non-existing
input device, causing kernel freeze.

To solve this problem, free all those already registered video output
devices once something goes wrong in acpi_video_bus_get_devices(), so
that no wild backlight interfaces and notification handlers exist.
