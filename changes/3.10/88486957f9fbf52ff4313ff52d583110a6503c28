ceph: kill ceph alloc_page_vec()

There is a helper function alloc_page_vec() that, despite its
generic sounding name depends heavily on an osd request structure
being populated with certain information.

There is only one place this function is used, and it ends up
being a bit simpler to just open code what it does, so get
rid of the helper.

The real motivation for this is deferring building the of the osd
request message, and this is a step in that direction.
