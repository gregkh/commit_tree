xen/tmem: Remove the boot options and fold them in the tmem.X parameters.

If tmem is built-in or a module, the user has the option on
the command line to influence it by doing: tmem.<some option>
instead of having a variety of "nocleancache", and
"nofrontswap". The others: "noselfballooning" and "selfballooning";
and "noselfshrink" are in a different driver xen-selfballoon.c
and the patches:

 xen/tmem: Remove the usage of 'noselfshrink' and use 'tmem.selfshrink' bool instead.
 xen/tmem: Remove the usage of 'noselfballoon','selfballoon' and use 'tmem.selfballon' bool instead.

remove them.

Also add documentation.
