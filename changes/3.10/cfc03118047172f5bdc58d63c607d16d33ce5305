sched: Don't consider other cpus in our group in case of NEWLY_IDLE

Commit 88b8dac0 makes load_balance() consider other cpus in its
group, regardless of idle type. When we do NEWLY_IDLE balancing,
we should not consider it, because a motivation of NEWLY_IDLE
balancing is to turn this cpu to non idle state if needed. This
is not the case of other cpus. So, change code not to consider
other cpus for NEWLY_IDLE balancing.

With this patch, assign 'if (pulled_task) this_rq->idle_stamp =
0' in idle_balance() is corrected, because NEWLY_IDLE balancing
doesn't consider other cpus. Assigning to 'this_rq->idle_stamp'
is now valid.
