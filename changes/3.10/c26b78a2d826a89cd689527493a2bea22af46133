PM / sleep: invalidate TEST_CPUS and TEST_CORE support for freeze state

freeze state is a software suspend state that does not run into
low-level platform callbacks which may interact with BIOS.
And freeze state does not need to disable the processors.

But the current pm_test support misleads users because users
can enter freeze state with pm_test set to TEST_CPUS/TEST_CORE,
while this pm_test setting never takes actions.

So, invalidate TEST_CPUS/TEST_CORE for freeze state in this patch.
Then users will get an error instead, when trying to
enter freeze state with pm_test mode set to TEST_CPUS/TEST_CORE.
