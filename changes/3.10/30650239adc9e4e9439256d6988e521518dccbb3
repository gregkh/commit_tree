powerpc: Add an in memory udbg console

This patch adds a new udbg early debug console which utilises
statically defined input and output buffers stored within the kernel
BSS. It is primarily designed to assist with bring up of new hardware
which may not have a working console but which has a method of
reading/writing kernel memory.

This version incorporates comments made by Ben H (thanks!).

Changes from v1:
	- Add memory barriers.
	- Ensure updating of read/write positions is atomic.
