slab: Use common kmalloc_index/kmalloc_size functions

Make slab use the common functions. We can get rid of a lot
of old ugly stuff as a results. Among them the sizes
array and the weird include/linux/kmalloc_sizes file and
some pretty bad #include statements in slab_def.h.

The one thing that is different in slab is that the 32 byte
cache will also be created for arches that have page sizes
larger than 4K. There are numerous smaller allocations that
SLOB and SLUB can handle better because of their support for
smaller allocation sizes so lets keep the 32 byte slab also
for arches with > 4K pages.
