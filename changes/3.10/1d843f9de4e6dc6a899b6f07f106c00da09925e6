DRM/I915: Add enum hpd_pin to intel_encoder.

To clean up hotplug support we add a new enum to intel_encoder:
enum hpd_pin. It allows the encoder to request a hpd line but leave
the details which IRQ is responsible on which chipset generation
to i915_irq.c.
This way requesting hotplug support will become really simple on
the encoder/connector level.
