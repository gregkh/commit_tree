powerpc/pseries: Add /proc interface to control topology updates

There are instances in which we do not want topology updates to occur.
In order to allow this a /proc interface (/proc/powerpc/topology_updates)
is introduced so that topology updates can be enabled and disabled.

This patch also adds a prrn_is_enabled() call so that PRRN events are
handled in the kernel only if topology updating is enabled.
