netfilter: xt_TCPMSS: Fix violation of RFC879 in absence of MSS option

The clamp-mss-to-pmtu option of the xt_TCPMSS target can cause issues
connecting to websites if there was no MSS option present in the
original SYN packet from the client. In these cases, it may add a
MSS higher than the default specified in RFC879. Fix this by never
setting a value > 536 if no MSS option was specified by the client.

This closes netfilter's bugzilla #662.
