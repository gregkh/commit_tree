DMA: OF: Check properties value before running be32_to_cpup() on it

In of_dma_controller_register() routine we are calling of_get_property() as an
parameter to be32_to_cpup(). In case the property doesn't exist we will get a
crash.

This patch changes this code to check if we got a valid property first and then
runs be32_to_cpup() on it.
