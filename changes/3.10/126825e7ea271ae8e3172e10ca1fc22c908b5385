ALSA: snd-usb: add quirks handler for DSD streams

Unfortunately, none of the UAC standards provides a way to identify DSD
(Direct Stream Digital) formats. Hence, this patch adds a quirks
handler to identify USB interfaces that are capable of handling DSD.

That quirks handler can augment the already parsed formats bit-field,
by any of the new SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_DSD_{U8_U16} and setting the dsd_dop
flag in the audio format, if the driver should take care for the DOP
byte stuffing.

The only devices that are known to work with this are the ones with
a 'Playback Designs' vendor id.
