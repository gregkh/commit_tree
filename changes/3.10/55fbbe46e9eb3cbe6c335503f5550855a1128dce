net: Fix vlan bitmask changes in EHEA driver.

This driver uses the crummy "| foo" style, putting the
logical operation at the beginning of lines.  Then
when the VLAN tag flag bits got changed the operator
ended up at both the end and the beginning of some lines.

Fix the build error by having it uniformly use the operator
at the end of the line.
