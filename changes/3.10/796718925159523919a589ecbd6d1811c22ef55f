ASoC: davinci: fix sample rotation

McASP serial audio engine needs different rotation values on TX and RX
channels. Commit dde109fb462 ("ASoC: McASP: Fix data rotation for
playback. Enables 24bit audio playback") changed the calculation to fix
the playback format, but broke the capture stream by doing it for both
TXFMT and RXFMT.
