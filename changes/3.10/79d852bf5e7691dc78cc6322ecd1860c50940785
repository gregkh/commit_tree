NFS: Retry SETCLIENTID with AUTH_SYS instead of AUTH_NONE

Recently I changed the SETCLIENTID code to use AUTH_GSS(krb5i), and
then retry with AUTH_NONE if that didn't work.  This was to enable
Kerberos NFS mounts to work without forcing Linux NFS clients to
have a keytab on hand.

Rick Macklem reports that the FreeBSD server accepts AUTH_NONE only
for NULL operations (thus certainly not for SETCLIENTID).  Falling
back to AUTH_NONE means our proposed 3.10 NFS client will not
interoperate with FreeBSD servers over NFSv4 unless Kerberos is
fully configured on both ends.

If the Linux client falls back to using AUTH_SYS instead for
SETCLIENTID, all should work fine as long as the NFS server is
configured to allow AUTH_SYS for SETCLIENTID.

This may still prevent access to Kerberos-only FreeBSD servers by
Linux clients with no keytab.  Rick is of the opinion that the
security settings the server applies to its pseudo-fs should also
apply to the SETCLIENTID operation.

Linux and Solaris NFS servers do not place that limitation on
SETCLIENTID.  The security settings for the server's pseudo-fs are
determined automatically as the union of security flavors allowed on
real exports, as recommended by RFC 3530bis; and the flavors allowed
for SETCLIENTID are all flavors supported by the respective server
implementation.
