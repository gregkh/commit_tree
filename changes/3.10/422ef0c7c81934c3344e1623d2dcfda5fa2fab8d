NVMe: Don't fail initialisation unnecessarily

The nvme_dev_add() function currently returns the last error code that it
saw, which (if everything else succeeds) happens to be the result of an
optional command, so it can legitimately fail.  Looking at the error path
more closely reveals that we should return success from this function,
even if no device namespaces are added.  So once the queues are created
and the device has responded to Identify, make sure that this function
succeeds.
