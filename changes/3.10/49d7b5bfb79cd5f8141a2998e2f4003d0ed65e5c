cpufreq: exynos: Add cpufreq driver for exynos5440

This patch adds dvfs support for exynos5440 SOC. This soc has 4 cores and
they scale at same frequency. The nature of exynos5440 clock controller is
different from previous exynos controllers so not using the common exynos
cpufreq framework. The major difference being interrupt notification for
frequency change. Also, OPP library is used for device tree parsing to get
different parameters like frequency, voltage etc. Since the opp library sorts
the frequency table in ascending order so they are again re-arranged in
descending order. This will have one-to-one mapping with the clock controller
state management logic.
