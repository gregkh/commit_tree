sysfs: check if one entry has been removed before freeing

It might be a kernel disaster if one sysfs entry is freed but
still referenced by sysfs tree.

Recently Dave and Sasha reported one use-after-free problem on
sysfs entry, and the problem has been troubleshooted with help
of debug message added in this patch.

Given sysfs_get_dirent/sysfs_put are exported APIs, even inside
sysfs they are called in many contexts(kobject/attribe add/delete,
inode init/drop, dentry lookup/release, readdir, ...), it is healthful
to check the removed flag before freeing one entry and dump message
if it is freeing without being removed first.
