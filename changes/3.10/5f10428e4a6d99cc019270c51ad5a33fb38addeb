ARM: shmobile: marzen: Use error values in usb_power_*

This patch updates the marzen board code as if USB PHY isn't enabled
they phy will have a value set by ERR_PTR() rather than be NULL.

Without this patch a NULL pointer dereference  and kernel panic
occurs on initialisation of USB on marzen.

This resolves a regression introduced in 3.10-rc1 by
b7fa5c2aec5be083eb2719b405089703608e9bc6
("usb: phy: return -ENXIO when PHY layer isn't enabled").
