tracing: Add snapshot in the per_cpu trace directories

Add the snapshot file into the per_cpu tracing directories to allow
them to be read for an individual cpu. This also allows to clear
an individual cpu from the snapshot buffer.

If the kernel allows it (CONFIG_RING_BUFFER_ALLOW_SWAP is set), then
echoing in '1' into one of the per_cpu snapshot files will do an
individual cpu buffer swap instead of the entire file.
