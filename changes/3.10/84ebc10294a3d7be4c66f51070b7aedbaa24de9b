USB: remove CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND option

This patch (as1675) removes the CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND option, essentially
replacing it everywhere with CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME (except for one place
in hub.c, where it is replaced with CONFIG_PM because the code needs
to be used in both runtime and system PM).  The net result is code
shrinkage and simplification.

There's very little point in keeping CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND because almost
everybody enables it.  The few that don't will find that the usbcore
module has gotten somewhat bigger and they will have to take active
measures if they want to prevent hubs from being runtime suspended.
