ARM: 7676/1: fix a wrong value returned from CALLER_ADDRn

This makes return_address() return a correct value for CALLER_ADDRn.
To have a correct value from CALLER_ADDRn, we need to fix three points.

* The unwind_frame() does not update frame->lr but frame->pc for backtrace.
So frame->pc is meaningful for backtrace.

* data.level should be adjusted by adding 2 additional iteration levels.
With the current +1 level adjustment, the result of CALLER_ADDR1 will
be the same return address with CALLER_ADDR0.

* The initialization of data.addr to NULL is needed.
When unwind_fame() fails right after data.level reaches zero,
the routine returns data.addr which has uninitialized garbage value.
