tracing: Return -EBUSY when event_enable_func() fails to get module

Since try_module_get() returns false( = 0) when it fails to
pindown a module, event_enable_func() returns 0 which means
"succeed". This can cause a kernel panic when the entry
is removed, because the event is already released.

This fixes the bug by returning -EBUSY, because the reason
why it fails is that the module is being removed at that time.
