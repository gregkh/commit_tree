ALSA: hda - Don't re-initialize shared hp/mic pinctl

When a headphone pin is set up as a shared hp/mic pin, we rather want
to keep it as a headphone primarily as default, but the driver
overrides it always as a mic pin, just because the input controls are
created after outputs.  Add a check of pin NID and skip the
re-initialization of pinctl for such a shared hp/mic pin.
