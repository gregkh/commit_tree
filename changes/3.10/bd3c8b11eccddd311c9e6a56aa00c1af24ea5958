ARC: Debug/crash-printing Improvements

* Remove the line-break between scratch/callee-regs (sneaked in when we
  converted from printk to pr_*

* Use %pS to print the symbol names of faulting PC (ret pseudo register)
  and BLINK (call return register)

* Don't print user-vma for a kernel crash (only do it for
  print-fatal-signals based regfile dump)

* Verbose print the Interrupt/Exception Enable/Active state

* for main executable link address is 0x10000 based (vs. 0) thus offset
  of faulting PC needs to be adjusted
