dm persistent data: add threshold callback to space map

Add a threshold callback function to the persistent data space map
interface for a subsequent patch to use.

dm-thin and dm-cache are interested in knowing when they're getting
low on metadata or data blocks.  This patch introduces a new method
for registering a callback against a threshold.
