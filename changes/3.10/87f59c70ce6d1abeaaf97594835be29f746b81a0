mac80211: init mesh timer for user authed STAs

There is a corner case which wasn't being covered:
userspace may authenticate and allocate stations,
but still leave the peering up to the kernel.

Initialize the peering timer if the MPM is not in
userspace, in a path which is taken by both the kernel and
userspace when allocating stations.
