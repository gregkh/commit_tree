KVM: s390: virtio_ccw: reset errors for new I/O.

ccw_io_helper neglected to reset vcdev->err after a new channel
program had been successfully started, resulting in stale errors
delivered after one I/O failed. Reset the error after a new
channel program has been successfully started with no old I/O
pending.
