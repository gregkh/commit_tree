udp6: Fix udp fragmentation for tunnel traffic.

udp6 over GRE tunnel does not work after to GRE tso changes. GRE
tso handler passes inner packet but keeps track of outer header
start in SKB_GSO_CB(skb)->mac_offset.  udp6 fragment need to
take care of outer header, which start at the mac_offset, while
adding fragment header.
This bug is introduced by commit 68c3316311 (GRE: Add TCP
segmentation offload for GRE).
