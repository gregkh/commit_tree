ARM: mcpm_head.S: vlock-based first man election

Instead of requiring the first man to be elected in advance (which
can be suboptimal in some situations), this patch uses a per-
cluster mutex to co-ordinate selection of the first man.

This should also make it more feasible to reuse this code path for
asynchronous cluster resume (as in CPUidle scenarios).

We must ensure that the vlock data doesn't share a cacheline with
anything else, or dirty cache eviction could corrupt it.
