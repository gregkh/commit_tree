abx500-chargalg: Store the AB8500 MFD parent device for platform differentiation

Any platform can be dynamically probed for model and version number
provided the AB8500 MFD parent device pointer is available. This
patch obtains that pointer and stores it in a locally controlled
struct for later use.
