memcg: force use_hierarchy if sane_behavior

Turn on use_hierarchy by default if sane_behavior is specified and
don't create .use_hierarchy file.

It is debatable whether to remove .use_hierarchy file or make it ro as
the former could make transition easier in certain cases; however, the
behavior changes which will be gated by sane_behavior are intensive
including changing basic meaning of certain control knobs in a few
controllers and I don't really think keeping this piece would make
things easier in any noticeable way, so let's remove it.

v2: Explain that mem_cgroup_bind() doesn't have to worry about
    children as suggested by Michal Hocko.
