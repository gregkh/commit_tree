ASoC: ep93xx: Use ep93xx_dma_params instead of ep93xx_pcm_dma_params

Currently the ep93xx_dma_params struct which is passed to the dmaengine driver
is constructed at runtime from the ep93xx_pcm_dma_params that gets passed to the
ep93xx PCM driver from one of the ep93xx DAI drivers. The ep93xx_pcm_dma_params
struct is almost identical to the ep93xx_dma_params struct. The only missing
field is the 'direction' field, which is computed at runtime in the PCM driver
based on the current substream. Since we know in advance which
ep93xx_pcm_dma_params struct is being used for which substream at compile time,
we also already know which direction to use at compile time. So we can easily
replace all instances of ep93xx_pcm_dma_params with their ep93xx_dma_params
counterpart. This allows us to simplify the code in the ep93xx pcm driver quite
a bit.
