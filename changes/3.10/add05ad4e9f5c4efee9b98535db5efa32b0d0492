unix/dgram: peek beyond 0-sized skbs

"77c1090 net: fix infinite loop in __skb_recv_datagram()" (v3.8) introduced a
regression:
After that commit, recv can no longer peek beyond a 0-sized skb in the queue.
__skb_recv_datagram() instead stops at the first skb with len == 0 and results
in the system call failing with -EFAULT via skb_copy_datagram_iovec().

When peeking at an offset with 0-sized skb(s), each one of those is received
only once, in sequence. The offset starts moving forward again after receiving
datagrams with len > 0.
