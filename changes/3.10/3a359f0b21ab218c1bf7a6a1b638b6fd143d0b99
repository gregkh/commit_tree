    drm: Introduce an iterator over holes in the drm_mm range manager

helpers and iterators for hole handling have been introduced with some
debug BUG_ONs sprinkled over. Unfortunately this broke the mm dumper
which unconditionally tried to compute the size of the very first
hole.

While at it unify the code a bit with the hole dumping in the loop.

v2: Extract a hole dump helper.
