mmc: mxcmmc: fix race conditions for host->req and host->data access

mxcmci_dma_callback() is invoked by DMA drivers in soft-irq
context and can be interrupted by the mxcmci_irq() interrupt
which can finish the mmc request or data transfer and set
host->req or host->data pointers to NULL. Then mxcmci_data_done()
crashes with a null pointer dereferences. Protect all accesses
to host->req and host->data by spin locks.

Also check host->data pointer in mxcmci_watchdog() before
dereferencing it.
