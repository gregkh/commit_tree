qlcnic: Fix updating netdev->features

o After change in EPORT features of 82xx adapter, netdev->features needs to
  be updated to reflect EPORT feature updates but driver was manipulating
  netdev->features at wrong place.
o This patch uses netdev_update_features() and .ndo_fix_features() to
  update netdev->features properly.
