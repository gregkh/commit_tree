fuse: make request allocations for background processing explicit

There are two types of processing requests in FUSE: synchronous (via
fuse_request_send()) and asynchronous (via adding to fc->bg_queue).

Fortunately, the type of processing is always known in advance, at the time
of request allocation. This preparatory patch utilizes this fact making
fuse_get_req() aware about the type. Next patches will use it.
