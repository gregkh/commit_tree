yam: remove redundant null check on dev

yam_open has a redundant null check on null,  it will
never be called with dev == NULL. Remove this redundant check.
This also cleans up a smatch warning:

drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c:869 yam_open() warn: variable
  dereferenced before check 'dev' (see line 867)
