staging: android: ashmem: Add support for 32bit ashmem calls in a 64bit kernel

Android's shared memory subsystem, Ashmem, does not support calls from a
32bit userspace in a 64 bit kernel. This patch adds support for syscalls
coming from a 32bit userspace in a 64bit kernel.

The patch has been successfully tested on ARMv8 AEM(64bit
platform model) and Versatile Express A9(32bit platform).

v2: Fix missing compat.h include.
