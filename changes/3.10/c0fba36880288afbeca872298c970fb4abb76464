rbd: have rbd_dev_image_id() set format 1 image id

Currently, rbd_dev_probe() assumes that any error returned by
rbd_dev_image_id() is most likely -ENOENT, and responds by
calling the format 1 probe routine, rbd_dev_v1_probe().  Then,
at the top of rbd_dev_v1_probe(), an empty string is allocated
for the image id.

This is sort of unbalanced.  Fix this by having rbd_dev_image_id()
look for -ENOENT from its "get_id" method call.  If that is seen,
have it allocate the empty string there rather than depending on
rbd_dev_v1_probe() to do it.

Given that this is effectively defining the format of the image,
set rbd_dev->image_format inside rbd_dev_image_id() rather than in
the format-specific probe routines.

Also drop a redundant hunk of code in rbd_dev_image_id().
