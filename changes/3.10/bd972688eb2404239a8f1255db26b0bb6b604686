firewire: ohci: Fix 'failed to read phy reg' on FW643 rev8

With the LSI FW643 rev 8 [1], the first commanded bus reset at
the conclusion of ohci_enable() has been observed to fail with
the following messages:

[    4.884015] firewire_ohci 0000:01:00.0: failed to read phy reg
....
[    5.684012] firewire_ohci 0000:01:00.0: failed to read phy reg

With drivers/firewire/ohci.c instrumented, the error condition [2]
indicates the PHY arbitration state machine has timed out prior to
enabling PHY LCtrl.

Furthermore, instrumenting ohci_enable() shows that LPS has been
enabled within 1 ms.

Test LPS latching every 1 ms rather than every 50ms.

[Stefan R:  Peter also reports a change of behavior with LSI FW323.
Before the patch, there would often occur a lock transaction failure
during firewire-core startup:
[    6.056022] firewire_core 0000:07:06.0: BM lock failed (timeout), making local node (ffc0) root
This failure no longer happens after the patch, without an obvious
reason for the failure or the fix.]

[Stefan R:  Added quirk flag, quirk table entry, and comment.]
