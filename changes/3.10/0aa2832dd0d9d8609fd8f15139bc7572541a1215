USB: use "global suspend" for system sleep on USB-2 buses

This patch (as1674) speeds up system sleep transitions by not
suspending each individual device on a USB-1.1 or USB-2 bus.  The
devices will automatically go into suspend when their root hubs are
suspended (i.e., stop sending out Start-Of-Frame packets) -- this is
what the USB spec calls "global suspend".

Since this is what we do already when CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND isn't
enabled, it shouldn't cause any problems.
