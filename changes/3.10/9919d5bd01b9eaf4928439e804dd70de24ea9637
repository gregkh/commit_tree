RDMA/cxgb4: Fix onchip queue support for T5

T5 adapter does not support onchip queue memory. Present logic fails to
allocate QP for T5 and returns an error. Also, if module parameter ocqp_support
is zero then we are unable to allocate QP which should not be the case. Ideally
if ocqp_support parameter is 0 or onchip queue support is disable then host QP
should be allocated before returning an error.
