mac80211/minstrel_ht: avoid useless sampling of high-probability slower rates

Slow rates that have >95% success probability do not need to be
monitored continuously. When the channel conditions change rapidly, the
slow sampling results are useless anyway. When conditions change slowly,
they will be monitored by gradual downgrading of the actively used
rates. This patch slightly improves throughput under good conditions.
