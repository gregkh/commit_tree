powerpc: Fix hardware IRQs with MMU on exceptions when HV=0

POWER8 allows us to take interrupts with the MMU on.  This gives us a
second set of vectors offset at 0x4000.

Unfortunately when coping these vectors we missed checking for MSR HV
for hardware interrupts (0x500).  This results in us trying to use
HSRR0/1 when HV=0, rather than SRR0/1 on HW IRQs

The below fixes this to check CPU_FTR_HVMODE when patching the code at
0x4500.

Also we remove the check for CPU_FTR_ARCH_206 since relocation on IRQs
are only available in arch 2.07 and beyond.

Thanks to benh for helping find this.
