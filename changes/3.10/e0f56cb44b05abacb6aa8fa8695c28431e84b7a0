f2fs: optimize get node page readahead part

We can remove the call to find_get_page to get a page from the cache
and check for up-to-date, instead we can make use of grab_cache_page
part itself to fetch the page from the cache.
So, removing the call and moving the PageUptodate at proper place, also
taken care of moving the lock_page condition in the page_hit part.
