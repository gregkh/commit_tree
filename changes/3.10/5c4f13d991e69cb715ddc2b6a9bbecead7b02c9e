drbd: fix effective error returned when refusing an invalidate

Since commit
  drbd: Disallow the peer_disk_state to be D_OUTDATED while connected
trying to invalidate a disconnected Primary returned an error code
that did not really match the situation:
"Refusing to be Outdated while Connected"

Insert two more specific conditions into is_valid_state(),
changing that to "Need access to UpToDate data",
respectively "Need a connection to start verify or resync".
