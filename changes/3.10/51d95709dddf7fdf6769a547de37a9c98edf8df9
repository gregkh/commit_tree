i2c: Make the return type of i2c_del_mux_adapter() void

i2c_del_mux_adapter always returns 0 and none of it current users check its
return value anyway. It is also an essential requirement of the Linux device
driver model, that functions which may be called from a device's remove callback
to free resources provided by the device, are not allowed to fail. This is the
case for i2c_del_mux_adapter(), so make its return type void to make the
fact that it won't fail explicit.
