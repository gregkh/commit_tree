drivers: uio: Fix UIO device registration failure

Until recently uio_get_minor() returned 0 for success and
a negative value on failure.  This became non-negative for suceess and
negative for failure.  Restore the original return value spec so that we can
successfully initialize UIO devices with a non-zero minor device
number.
