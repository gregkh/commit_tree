parisc/PCI: Set type for LBA bus_num resource

The non-PAT resource probing code failed to set the type of the LBA bus_num
resource (30aa80da43 "parisc/PCI: register busn_res for root buses" did
the corresponding thing for the PAT case).

This causes incorrect resource assignments and a non-working stifb
framebuffer on most parisc machines.
