tty: Halt both ldiscs concurrently

The pty driver does not obtain an ldisc reference to the linked
tty when writing. When the ldiscs are sequentially halted, it
is possible for one ldisc to be halted, and before the second
ldisc can be halted, a concurrent write schedules buffer work on
the first ldisc. This can lead to an access-after-free error when
the scheduled buffer work starts on the closed ldisc.

Prevent subsequent use after halt by performing each stage
of the halt on both ttys.
