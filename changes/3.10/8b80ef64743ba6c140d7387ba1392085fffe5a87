drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1374.c: add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions

Add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions to fix the following
build warning when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not selected.  This is because
sleep PM callbacks defined by SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS are only used when the
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled.

  drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1374.c:413:12: warning: 'ds1374_suspend' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
  drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1374.c:422:12: warning: 'ds1374_resume' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
