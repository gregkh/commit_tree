drm/i915: ensure single initialization and cleanup of backlight device

Backlight cleanup in the eDP connector destroy callback caused the
backlight device to be removed on some systems that first initialized LVDS
and then attempted to initialize eDP. Prevent multiple backlight
initializations, and ensure backlight cleanup is only done once by moving
it to modeset cleanup.

A small wrinkle is the introduced asymmetry in backlight
setup/cleanup. This could be solved by adding refcounting, but it seems
overkill considering that there should only ever be one backlight device.
