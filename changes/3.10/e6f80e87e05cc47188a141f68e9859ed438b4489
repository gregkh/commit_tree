m68k/atari: EtherNAT - add interrupt chip definition for CPLD interrupts

Add a dedicated interrupt chip definition for the EtherNAT CPLD interrupts.
SMC91C111 and ISP1160 chips have separate interrupts that can be enabled
and disabled in a CPLD register at offset 0x23 from the card base.

Note the CPLD interrupt control register is mapped on demand, whenever any
interrupt enable/disable action is requested. The EtherNAT USB driver still
needs interrupts disabled around reset and start actions.
In particular, we cannot entirely rely on the irq_startup being called
first.

The smc91x and isp116x-hcd drivers will use this feature.
