ALSA: hda/via - Fix wrongly cleared pins after suspend on VT1802

VIA driver has a special suspend handling only for VT1802 to reduce
the pop noise.  During the transition to the generic parser, the
behavior of snd_hda_set_pin_ctl() was also changed to modify the
cached values, too.  And this caused a regression where the pin is
still cleared even after the resume (including the resume from power
save), resulting in the silent output.

The fix is simply to replace snd_hda_set_pin_ctl() with the explicit
call of snd_hda_codec_write() again.
