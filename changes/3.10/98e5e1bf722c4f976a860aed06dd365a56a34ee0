dump_stack: implement arch-specific hardware description in task dumps

x86 and ia64 can acquire extra hardware identification information
from DMI and print it along with task dumps; however, the usage isn't
consistent.

* x86 show_regs() collects vendor, product and board strings and print
  them out with PID, comm and utsname.  Some of the information is
  printed again later in the same dump.

* warn_slowpath_common() explicitly accesses the DMI board and prints
  it out with "Hardware name:" label.  This applies to both x86 and
  ia64 but is irrelevant on all other archs.

* ia64 doesn't show DMI information on other non-WARN dumps.

This patch introduces arch-specific hardware description used by
dump_stack().  It can be set by calling dump_stack_set_arch_desc()
during boot and, if exists, printed out in a separate line with
"Hardware name:" label.

dmi_set_dump_stack_arch_desc() is added which sets arch-specific
description from DMI data.  It uses dmi_ids_string[] which is set from
dmi_present() used for DMI debug message.  It is superset of the
information x86 show_regs() is using.  The function is called from x86
and ia64 boot code right after dmi_scan_machine().

This makes the explicit DMI handling in warn_slowpath_common()
unnecessary.  Removed.

show_regs() isn't yet converted to use generic debug information
printing and this patch doesn't remove the duplicate DMI handling in
x86 show_regs().  The next patch will unify show_regs() handling and
remove the duplication.

An example WARN dump follows.

v2: Use the same string as the debug message from dmi_present() which
    also contains BIOS information.  Move hardware name into its own
    line as warn_slowpath_common() did.  This change was suggested by
    Bjorn Helgaas.
