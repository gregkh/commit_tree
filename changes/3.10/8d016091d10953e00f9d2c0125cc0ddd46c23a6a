tracing: Bring Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt up to date

The ftrace.txt document has been suffering from some serious bit rot.

Updated the current content to how things are as of v3.10.
Remove things that no longer exist.
Add documentation about new features:
  per_cpu
  stats
  instances
  stack trace
  etc.
