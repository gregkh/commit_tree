block: Fix a buffer overrun in bio_integrity_split()

bio_integrity_split() seemed to be confusing pointers and arrays -
bip_vec in bio_integrity_payload was an array appended to the end of the
payload, so the bio_vecs in struct bio_pair should have come after the
bio_integrity_payload they're for.

Fix it by making bip_vec a pointer to the inline vecs - a later patch is
going to make more use of this pointer.
