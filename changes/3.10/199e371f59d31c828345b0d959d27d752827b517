lockdep: Print out additional debugging advice when we hit lockdep BUGs

We occasionally get reports of these BUGs being hit, and the
stack trace doesn't necessarily always tell us what we need to
know about why we are hitting those limits.

If users start attaching /proc/lock_stats to reports we may have
more of a clue what's going on.
