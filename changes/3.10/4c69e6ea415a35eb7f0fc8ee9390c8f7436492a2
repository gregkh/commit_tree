tracepoints: Prevent null probe from being added

Somehow tracepoint_entry_add_probe() function allows a null probe function.
And, this may lead to unexpected results since the number of probe
functions in an entry can be counted by checking whether a probe is null
or not in the for-loop.
This patch prevents a null probe from being added.
In tracepoint_entry_remove_probe() function, checking probe parameter
within the for-loop is moved out for code efficiency, leaving the null probe
feature which removes all probe functions in the entry.
