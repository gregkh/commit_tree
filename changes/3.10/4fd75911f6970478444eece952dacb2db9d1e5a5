ARM: 7687/1: atomics: don't use exclusives for atomic64 read/set with LPAE

To ease page table updates with 64-bit descriptors, CPUs implementing
LPAE are required to implement ldrd/strd as atomic operations.

This patch uses these accessors instead of the exclusive variants when
performing atomic64_{read,set} on LPAE systems.
