x86, relocs: Add 64-bit ELF support to relocs tool

This adds the ability to process relocations from the 64-bit kernel ELF,
if built with ELF_BITS=64 defined. The special case for the percpu area is
handled, along with some other symbols specific to the 64-bit kernel.

Based on work by Neill Clift and Michael Davidson.
