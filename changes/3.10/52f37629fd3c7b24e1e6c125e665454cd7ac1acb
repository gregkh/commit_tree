THP: fix comment about memory barrier

Currently the memory barrier in __do_huge_pmd_anonymous_page doesn't
work.  Because lru_cache_add_lru uses pagevec so it could miss spinlock
easily so above rule was broken so user might see inconsistent data.

I was not first person who pointed out the problem.  Mel and Peter
pointed out a few months ago and Peter pointed out further that even
spin_lock/unlock can't make sure of it:

  http://marc.info/?t=134333512700004

	In particular:

        	*A = a;
        	LOCK
        	UNLOCK
        	*B = b;

	may occur as:

        	LOCK, STORE *B, STORE *A, UNLOCK

At last, Hugh pointed out that even we don't need memory barrier in
there because __SetPageUpdate already have done it from Nick's commit
0ed361dec369 ("mm: fix PageUptodate data race") explicitly.

So this patch fixes comment on THP and adds same comment for
do_anonymous_page, too because everybody except Hugh was missing that.
It means we need a comment about that.
