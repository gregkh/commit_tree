regulator: palmas: add support for LDO8 tracking mode

LDO8 of Palma device like tps65913 support the tracking mode
on which LDO8 track the SMPS45 voltage when SMPS45 is ON
and use the LDO8.VOLTAGE_SEL register when SMPS45 is OFF.

On track mode, the steps of voltage change for LDO8 is 25mV
where in non-tracking mode it is 50mV. Set the steps accordingly.
Number of voltage count is still same for both the cases.
