KVM: PPC: Book3E: Refactor ONE_REG ioctl implementation

Refactor Book3E ONE_REG ioctl implementation to use kvmppc_get_one_reg/
kvmppc_set_one_reg delegation interface introduced by Book3S. This is
necessary for MMU SPRs which are platform specifics.

Get rid of useless case braces in the process.
