libceph: fix byte order mismatch

A WATCH op includes an object version.  The version that's supplied
is incorrectly byte-swapped osd_req_op_watch_init() where it's first
assigned (it's been this way since that code was first added).

The result is that the version sent to the osd is wrong, because
that value gets byte-swapped again in osd_req_encode_op().  This
is the source of a sparse warning related to improper byte order in
the assignment.

The approach of using the version to avoid a race is deprecated
(see http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/3871), and the watch parameter
is no longer even examined by the osd.  So fix the assignment in
osd_req_op_watch_init() so it no longer does the byte swap.

This resolves:
