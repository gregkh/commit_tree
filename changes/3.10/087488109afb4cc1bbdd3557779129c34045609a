btrfs: clean up transaction abort messages

The transaction abort stacktrace is printed only once per module
lifetime, but we'd like to see it each time it happens per mounted
filesystem.  Introduce a fs_state flag that records it.

Tweak the messages around abort:
* add error number to the first abort
* print the exact negative errno from btrfs_decode_error
* clean up btrfs_decode_error and callers
* no dots at the end of the messages
