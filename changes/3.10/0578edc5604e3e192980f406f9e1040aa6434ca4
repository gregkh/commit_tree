packet: reorder a member in packet_ring_buffer

There's a 4 byte hole in packet_ring_buffer structure before
prb_bdqc, that can be filled with 'pending' member, thus we can
reduce the overall structure size from 224 bytes to 216 bytes.
This also has the side-effect, that in struct packet_sock 2*4 byte
holes after the embedded packet_ring_buffer members are removed,
and overall, packet_sock can be reduced by 1 cacheline:

Before: size: 1344, cachelines: 21, members: 24
After:  size: 1280, cachelines: 20, members: 24
