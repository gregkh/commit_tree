regmap: cache: Write consecutive registers in a single block write

When syncing blocks of data using raw writes combine the writes into a
single block write, saving us bus overhead for setup, addressing and
teardown.

Currently the block write is done unconditionally as it is expected that
hardware which has a register format which can support raw writes will
support auto incrementing writes, this decision may need to be revised in
future.
