cpufreq: ARM big LITTLE: Add generic cpufreq driver and its DT glue

big LITTLE is ARM's new Architecture focussing power/performance needs of modern
world. More information about big LITTLE can be found here:

In order to keep cpufreq support for all big LITTLE platforms simple/generic,
this patch tries to add a generic cpufreq driver layer for all big LITTLE
platforms.

The driver is divided into two parts:
- Core driver: Generic and shared across all big LITTLE SoC's
- Glue drivers: Per platform drivers providing ops to the core driver

This patch adds in a generic glue driver which would extract information from
Device Tree.

Future SoC's can either reuse the DT glue or write their own depending on the
need.
