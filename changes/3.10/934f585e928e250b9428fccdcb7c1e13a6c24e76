xen: clear IRQ_NOAUTOEN and IRQ_NOREQUEST

Reset the IRQ_NOAUTOEN and IRQ_NOREQUEST flags that are enabled by
default on ARM. If IRQ_NOAUTOEN is set, __setup_irq doesn't call
irq_startup, that is responsible for calling irq_unmask at startup time.
As a result event channels remain masked.

The clear is already made in bind_evtchn_to_irq with commit a8636c0 but was
missing on all others bind_*_to_irq. Move the clear in xen_irq_info_common_init.

On x86, IRQ_NOAUTOEN and IRQ_NOREQUEST are cleared by default, so this commit
doesn't impact this architecture.
