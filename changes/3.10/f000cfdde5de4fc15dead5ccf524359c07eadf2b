audit: wait_for_auditd() should use TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE

audit_log_start() does wait_for_auditd() in a loop until
audit_backlog_wait_time passes or audit_skb_queue has a room.

If signal_pending() is true this becomes a busy-wait loop, schedule() in
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE won't block.

Thanks to Guy for fully investigating and explaining the problem.

(akpm: that'll cause the system to lock up on a non-preemptible
uniprocessor kernel)

(Guy: "Our customer was in fact running a uniprocessor machine, and they
reported a system hang.")
