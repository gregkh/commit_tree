Drivers: hv: Add a new driver to support host initiated backup

This driver supports host initiated backup of the guest. On Windows guests,
the host can generate application consistent backups using the Windows VSS
framework. On Linux, we ensure that the backup will be file system consistent.
This driver allows the host to initiate a  "Freeze" operation on all the mounted
file systems in the guest. Once the mounted file systems in the guest are frozen,
the host snapshots the guest's file systems. Once this is done, the guest's file
systems are "thawed".

This driver has a user-level component (daemon) that invokes the appropriate
operation on all the mounted file systems in response to the requests from
the host. The duration for which the guest is frozen is very short - a few seconds.
During this interval, the diff disk is comitted.

In this version of the patch I have addressed the feedback from Olaf Herring.
Also, some of the connector related issues have been fixed.
