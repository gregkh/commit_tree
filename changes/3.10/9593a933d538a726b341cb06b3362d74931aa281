ARC: [cmdline] Don't overwrite u-boot provided bootargs

The existing code was wrong on several counts:

* uboot provided bootargs were copied into @boot_command_line, only to
  be over-written by setup_machine_fdt(), effectively lost

* @cmdline_p returned by setup_arch() to start_kernel() didn't include
  the DT /bootargs
