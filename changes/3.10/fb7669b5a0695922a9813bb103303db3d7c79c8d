Btrfs: don't BUG_ON() in btrfs_num_copies

A user sent me a btrfs-image that was panicing because of some corruption.  This
is because we pass in a bogus value to btrfs_num_copies, and it panics.  Instead
just return 1.  We only call btrfs_num_copies to see if there are other copies
to try and read for things, so if we just return 1 it will make the callers exit
out with an appropriate error value.  Thanks,
