workqueue: use NUMA-aware allocation for pool_workqueues

Use kmem_cache_alloc_node() with @pool->node instead of
kmem_cache_zalloc() when allocating a pool_workqueue so that it's
allocated on the same node as the associated worker_pool.  As there's
no no kmem_cache_zalloc_node(), move zeroing to init_pwq().
