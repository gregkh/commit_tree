xfs: Fix WARN_ON(delalloc) in xfs_vm_releasepage()

When a dirty page is truncated from a file but reclaim gets to it before
truncate_inode_pages(), we hit WARN_ON(delalloc) in
xfs_vm_releasepage(). This is because reclaim tries to write the page,
xfs_vm_writepage() just bails out (leaving page clean) and thus reclaim
thinks it can continue and calls xfs_vm_releasepage() on page with dirty
buffers.

Fix the issue by redirtying the page in xfs_vm_writepage(). This makes
reclaim stop reclaiming the page and also logically it keeps page in a
more consistent state where page with dirty buffers has PageDirty set.
