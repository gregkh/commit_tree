staging: comedi: s626: cleanup "subdevice" and "cmd" in s626_irq_handler()

The comedi_subdevice in this function is actually the dev->read_subdev
that was initialized during the attach of the board. Use that instead
of accessing the dev->subdevices array directly.

Also, get the comedi_cmd used in s626_irq_handler() when the function
is first entered.
