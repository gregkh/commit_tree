rbd: fix leak of format 2 snapshot names

When the snapshot context for an rbd device gets updated (or the
initial one is recorded) a a list of snapshot structures is created
to represent them, one entry per snapshot.  Each entry includes a
dynamically-allocated copy of the snapshot name.

Currently the name is allocated in rbd_snap_create(), as a duplicate
of the passed-in name.

For format 1 images, the snapshot name provided is just a pointer to
an existing name.  But for format 2 images, the passed-in name is
already dynamically allocated, and in the the process of duplicating
it here we are leaking the passed-in name.

Fix this by dynamically allocating the name for format 1 snapshots
also, and then stop allocating a duplicate in rbd_snap_create().

Change rbd_dev_v1_snap_info() so none of its parameters is
side-effected unless it's going to return success.
