range: Do not add new blank slot with add_range_with_merge

Joshua reported: Commit cd7b304dfaf1 (x86, range: fix missing merge
during add range) broke mtrr cleanup on his setup in 3.9.5.
corresponding commit in upstream is fbe06b7bae7c.

The reason is add_range_with_merge could generate blank spot.

We could avoid that by searching new expanded start/end, that
new range should include all connected ranges in range array.
At last add the new expanded start/end to the range array.
Also move up left array so do not add new blank slot in the
range array.

-v2: move left array to avoid enhance add_range()
-v3: include fix from Joshua about memmove declaring when
     DYN_DEBUG is used.
