drivers/leds/leds-ot200.c: fix error caused by shifted mask

During the development of this driver an in-house register documentation
was used.  The last week some integration tests were done and this
problem was found.  It turned out that the released register
documentation is wrong.

The fix is very simple: shift all masks by one.
