Drivers: Staging: cxt1e1: strncpy issue, need set zero at the end.

  need set '\0' at the end. or cause issue.

    it is called by c4_ioctl in drivers/staging/cxt1e1/linux.c
    all things need be initialized, before provide them to user mode.
    so we can not use strlcpy instead of strncpy.

  code style:
    all contents of the file use 4 spaces instead of '\t',
    so this patch has to follow, now.
