ARM: OMAP1: fix omap_udc registration

omap_udc platform device is not registered properly anymore:
CONFIG_USB_GADGET_OMAP was deleted by 193ab2a6 (usb: gadget: allow
multiple gadgets to be built) already in v3.1.

Fix by using CONFIG_USB_OMAP instead. Tested on Nokia 770 by checking
that omap_udc is probed & working properly when built as a module.
