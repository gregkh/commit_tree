xfs: add CRC checks to the AGFL

Add CRC checks, location information and a magic number to the AGFL.
Previously the AGFL was just a block containing nothing but the
free block pointers.  The new AGFL has a real header with the usual
boilerplate instead, so that we can verify it's not corrupted and
written into the right place.

[dchinner@redhat.com] Added LSN field, reworked significantly to fit
into new verifier structure and growfs structure, enabled full
verifier functionality now there is a header to verify and we can
guarantee an initialised AGFL.
