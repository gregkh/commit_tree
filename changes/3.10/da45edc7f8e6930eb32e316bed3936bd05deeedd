regulator: ab8500: Shuffle init functions into a more logical order

The ab*_match[] arrays should be moved out of the way, instead of
bunched in the middle of the initialisation functions. This patch
moves all initialisation code which currently resides above these
arrays down to be grouped with the others. This makes the whole
thing slightly easier to read.
