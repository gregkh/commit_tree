perf: make perf_event cgroup hierarchical

perf_event is one of a couple remaining cgroup controllers with broken
hierarchy support.  Converting it to support hierarchy is almost
trivial.  The only thing necessary is to consider a task belonging to
a descendant cgroup as a match.  IOW, if the cgroup of the currently
executing task (@cpuctx->cgrp) equals or is a descendant of the
event's cgroup (@event->cgrp), then the event should be enabled.

Implement hierarchy support and remove .broken_hierarchy tag along
with the incorrect comment on what needs to be done for hierarchy
support.
