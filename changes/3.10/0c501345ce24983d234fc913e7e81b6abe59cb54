batman-adv: fix global protection fault during soft_iface destruction

batadv_mesh_free() schedules some RCU callbacks which need the bat_priv struct
to do their jobs, while free_netdev(), which is called immediately after, is
destroying the private data.

Put an rcu_barrier() in the middle so that free_netdev() is invoked only after
all the callbacks returned.
