workqueue: remove workqueue_struct->pool_wq.single

workqueue->pool_wq union is used to point either to percpu pwqs
(pool_workqueues) or single unbound pwq.  As the first pwq can be
accessed via workqueue->pwqs list, there's no reason for the single
pointer anymore.

Use list_first_entry(workqueue->pwqs) to access the unbound pwq and
drop workqueue->pool_wq.single pointer and the pool_wq union.  It
simplifies the code and eases implementing multiple unbound pools w/
custom attributes.

This patch doesn't introduce any visible behavior changes.
