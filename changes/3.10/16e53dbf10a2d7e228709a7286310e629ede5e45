CPU hotplug: provide a generic helper to disable/enable CPU hotplug

There are instances in the kernel where we would like to disable CPU
hotplug (from sysfs) during some important operation.  Today the freezer
code depends on this and the code to do it was kinda tailor-made for
that.

Restructure the code and make it generic enough to be useful for other
usecases too.
