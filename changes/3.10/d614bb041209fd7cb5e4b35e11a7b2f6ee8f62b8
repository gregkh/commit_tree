powerpc: Move the pte free routines from common header

Acked-by: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>

This patch moves the common code to 32/64 bit headers and also duplicate
4K_PAGES and 64K_PAGES section. We will later change the 64 bit 64K_PAGES
version to support smaller PTE fragments. The patch doesn't introduce
any functional changes.
