libceph: advance pagelist with list_rotate_left()

While processing an outgoing pagelist (either the data pagelist or
trail) in a ceph message, the messenger cycles through each of the
pages on the list.  This is accomplished in out_msg_pos_next(), if
the end of the first page on the list is reached, the first page is
moved to the end of the list.

There is a list operation, list_rotate_left(), which performs
exactly this operation, and by using it, what's really going on
becomes more obvious.

So replace these two list_move_tail() calls with list_rotate_left().
