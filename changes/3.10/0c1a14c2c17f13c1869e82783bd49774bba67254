gma500:fix build failure for 3.9-rc5

Last version of this patch is not clear enough and X86 duplicated.

This patch fixes build failure of v3.9-rc5 and rc6.
When config ACPI_VIDEO as m, DRM_GMA500 as y, here comes the failure.
GMA5/600 needs acpi_video just like nouveau.
And some tab type fix by the way.

Failure message:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `psb_driver_load':
kernel-3.9-rc5/drivers/gpu/drm/gma500/psb_drv.c:340: \
	undefined reference to `acpi_video_register'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
