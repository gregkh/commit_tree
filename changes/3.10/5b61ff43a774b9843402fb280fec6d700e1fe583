IB/iser: Fix device removal flow

Change the code to destroy the "last opened" rdma_cm id after making
sure we released all other objects (QP, CQs, PD, etc) associated with
the IB device.

Since iser accesses the IB device using the rdma_cm id, we need to
free any objects that are related to the device that is associated
with the rdma_cm id prior to destroying that id.  When this isn't
done, the low level driver that created this device can be unloaded
before iser has a chance to free all the objects and a such a call may
invoke code segment which isn't valid any more and crash.
