ACPI / LPSS: Power up LPSS devices during enumeration

Commit 7cd8407 (ACPI / PM: Do not execute _PS0 for devices without
_PSC during initialization) introduced a regression on some systems
with Intel Lynxpoint Low-Power Subsystem (LPSS) where some devices
need to be powered up during initialization, but their device objects
in the ACPI namespace have _PS0 and _PS3 only (without _PSC or power
resources).

To work around this problem, make the ACPI LPSS driver power up
devices it knows about by using a new helper function
acpi_device_fix_up_power() that does all of the necessary
sanity checks and calls acpi_dev_pm_explicit_set() to put the
device into D0.
