ARM: ux500: Fix incorrect DEBUG UART virtual addresses

A recent move to rid header files which were hindering multiplatform
support forced address allocations out of the headers and into the
files which were using them. We also lost some useful macros such as
IO_ADDRESS(), so physical -> virtual addressing has been carried out
manually in this case. Unfortunately the incorrect value was converted.
This patch rectifies the error and ensures earlyprintk works again.
