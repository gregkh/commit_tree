HID: make sensor autodetection independent of underlying bus

Instead of limiting HID sensors to USB and I2C busses we can just make
everything that has usage page of HID_UP_SENSOR to be included in
HID_GROUP_SENSOR_HUB group. This allows the sensor-hub to work over
bluetooth (and other transports) as well.
