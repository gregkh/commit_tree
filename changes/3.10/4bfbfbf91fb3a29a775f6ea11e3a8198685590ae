ipvs: off by one in set_sctp_state()

The sctp_events[] come from sch->type in set_sctp_state().  They are
between 0-255 so that means we need 256 elements in the array.

I believe that because of how the code is aligned there is normally a
hole after sctp_events[] so this patch doesn't actually change anything.
