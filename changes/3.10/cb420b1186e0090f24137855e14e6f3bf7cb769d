ALSA: hda - allow "Headphone Mic" parser flag

This allows a specific mic to get the "Headphone Mic" name, in addition
to the existing "Headset Mic" name.

Also, it allows for a special mark: if the sequence number is set
to 0xc, that's an indication to prefer it for headset mic, and if it's
set to 0xd, that's an indication to prefer it for headphone mic.
