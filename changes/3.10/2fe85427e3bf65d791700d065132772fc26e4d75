perf: Add PERF_RECORD_MISC_MMAP_DATA to RECORD_MMAP

Type of mapping was lost and made it hard for a tool
to distinguish code vs. data mmaps. Perf has the ability
to distinguish the two.

Use a bit in the header->misc bitmask to keep track of
the mmap type. If PERF_RECORD_MISC_MMAP_DATA is set then
the mapping is not executable (!VM_EXEC). If not set, then
the mapping is executable.
