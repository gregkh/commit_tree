sata_rcar: clear STOP bit in bmdma_start() method

Iff bmdma_setup() has to stop a DMA transfer before starting a new
one, then the STOP bit in the ATAPI_CONTROL1 register will remain set
(it's only cleared when setting the START bit to 1) and then
bmdma_start() method will set both START and STOP bits simultaneously
which should abort the transfer being just started.  Avoid that by
explicitly clearing the STOP bit in bmdma_start() method (in this case
it will be ignored on write).
