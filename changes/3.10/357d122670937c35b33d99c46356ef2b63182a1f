x86, xen, gdt: Remove the pvops variant of store_gdt.

The two use-cases where we needed to store the GDT were during ACPI S3 suspend
and resume. As the patches:
 x86/gdt/i386: store/load GDT for ACPI S3 or hibernation/resume path is not needed
 x86/gdt/64-bit: store/load GDT for ACPI S3 or hibernate/resume path is not needed.

have demonstrated - there are other mechanism by which the GDT is
saved and reloaded during early resume path.

Hence we do not need to worry about the pvops call-chain for saving the
GDT and can and can eliminate it. The other areas where the store_gdt is
used are never going to be hit when running under the pvops platforms.
