arm: tegra: fix Kconfig select clauses

USB_ULPI and USB_ULPI_VIEWPORT shouldn't really
be selected directly by anyone, but since Tegra
still needs some time before turning ulpi viewport
into a proper PHY driver, we need to keep the
selects in place.

This patch just fixes the conditional select
so that it will continue to build after merging
the latest PHY layer changes.
