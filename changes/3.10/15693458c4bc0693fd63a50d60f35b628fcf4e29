tracing/ring-buffer: Move poll wake ups into ring buffer code

Move the logic to wake up on ring buffer data into the ring buffer
code itself. This simplifies the tracing code a lot and also has the
added benefit that waiters on one of the instance buffers can be woken
only when data is added to that instance instead of data added to
any instance.
