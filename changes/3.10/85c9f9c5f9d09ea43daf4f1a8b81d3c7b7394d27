ASoC: dmaengine-pcm: Add a common DAI DMA data struct

This patch adds a common DMA data struct which can be used by DAI drivers to
communicate their DMA configuration requirements to the DMA pcm driver.  Having
a common data structure for this allows us to implement common functions on top
of them, which can be used by multiple platforms.

This patch also introduces a new function to initialize certain fields of a
dma_slave_config struct from the common DAI DMA data struct.
