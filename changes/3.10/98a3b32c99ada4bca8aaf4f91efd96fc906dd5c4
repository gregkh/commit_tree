perf tools: Add mem access sampling core support

This patch adds the sorting and histogram support
functions to enable profiling of memory accesses.

The following sorting orders are added:
 - symbol_daddr: data address symbol (or raw address)
 - dso_daddr: data address shared object
 - locked: access uses locked transaction
 - tlb : TLB access
 - mem : memory level of the access (L1, L2, L3, RAM, ...)
 - snoop: access snoop mode

[ committer note: changed to cope with fc5871ed, the move of methods to
  machine.[ch], and the rename of dsrc to data_src, to match the change
  made in the PERF_SAMPLE_DSRC in a previous patch. ]
