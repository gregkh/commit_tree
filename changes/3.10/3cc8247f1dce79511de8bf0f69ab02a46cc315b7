clk: Introduce optional unprepare_unused callback

An unprepare_unused callback is introduced due to the same reasons to
why the disable_unused callback was added.

During the clk_disable_unused sequence, those clk_hw that needs specific
treatment with regards to being unprepared, shall implement the
unprepare_unused callback.
