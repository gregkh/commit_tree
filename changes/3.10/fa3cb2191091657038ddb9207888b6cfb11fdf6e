staging: comedi: ni_labpc: split out PCI support

Currently the ni_labpc driver is used by the legacy (ISA), PCI, and
PCMCIA versions of the LabPC board. The driver is enabled under the
COMEDI_PCI_DRIVERS section of the Kconfig. This means that PCI support
must be enabled in order to use the ni_labpc driver for the PCI or
PCMCIA drivers.

Split the PCI support code out of the ni_labpc driver into a separate
driver, ni_labpc_pci. The PCMCIA support is already slip out as
ni_labpc_cs.

Modify the Kconfig so that the common code in ni_labpc is enabled by the
Kconfig option COMEDI_NI_LABPC. The ISA support code is currently still
in the ni_labpc driver but is only compiled in if COMEDI_NI_LABPC_ISA is
also enabled.

This allows the PCI and PCMCIA drivers to be enabled without the need
for the ISA stuff.
