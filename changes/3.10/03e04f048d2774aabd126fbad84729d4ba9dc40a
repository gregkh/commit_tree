aio: fix kioctx not being freed after cancellation at exit time

The recent changes overhauling fs/aio.c introduced a bug that results in
the kioctx not being freed when outstanding kiocbs are cancelled at
exit_aio() time.  Specifically, a kiocb that is cancelled has its
completion events discarded by batch_complete_aio(), which then fails to
wake up the process stuck in free_ioctx().  Fix this by modifying the
wait_event() condition in free_ioctx() appropriately.

This patch was tested with the cancel operation in the thread based code
posted yesterday.
