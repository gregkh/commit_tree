mlx4: Match DMFS promiscuous field names to firmware spec

Align the names used by enum mlx4_net_trans_promisc_mode with the
actual firmware specification.  The patch doesn't introduce any
functional change or API change towards the firmware.

Remove MLX4_FS_PROMISC_FUNCTION_PORT which isn't of use.  Add new
enums MLX4_FS_{UC/MC}_SNIFFER as a preparation step for sniffer
support.
