Btrfs: make sure roots are assigned before freeing their nodes

If we fail to load the chunk tree we'll call free_root_pointers, except we may
not have assigned the roots for the dev_root/extent_root/csum_root yet, so we
could NULL pointer deref at this point.  Just add checks to make sure these
roots are set to keep us from panicing.  Thanks,
