xfs: add quota-driven speculative preallocation throttling

Introduce the need_throttle() and calc_throttle() functions to
independently check whether throttling is required for a particular
dquot and if so, calculate the associated throttling metrics based
on the state of the quota. We use the same general algorithm to
calculate the throttle shift as for global free space with the
exception of using three stages rather than five.

Update xfs_iomap_prealloc_size() to use the smallest available
prealloc size based on each of the constraints and apply the
maximum shift to obtain the throttled preallocation size.
