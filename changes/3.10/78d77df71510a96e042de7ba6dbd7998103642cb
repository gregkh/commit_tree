x86-64, init: Do not set NX bits on non-NX capable hardware

During early init, we would incorrectly set the NX bit even if the NX
feature was not supported.  Instead, only set this bit if NX is
actually available and enabled.  We already do very early detection of
the NX bit to enable it in EFER, this simply extends this detection to
the early page table mask.
