of: Fix locking vs. interrupts

The OF code uses irqsafe locks everywhere except in a handful of functions
for no obvious reasons. Since the conversion from the old rwlocks, this
now triggers lockdep warnings when used at interrupt time. At least one
driver (ibmvscsi) seems to be doing that from softirq context.

This converts the few non-irqsafe locks into irqsafe ones, making them
consistent with the rest of the code.
