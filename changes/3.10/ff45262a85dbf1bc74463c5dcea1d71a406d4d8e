leds: add new LP5562 LED driver

LP5562 can drive up to 4 channels, RGB and White.
LEDs can be controlled directly via the led class control interface.

 LP55xx common driver
  LP5562 is one of LP55xx family device, so LP55xx common code are used.
  On the other hand, chip specific configuration is defined in the structure
  'lp55xx_device_config'

 LED pattern data
  LP5562 has also internal program memory which is used for running various LED
  patterns. LP5562 driver supports the firmware interface and the predefined
  pattern data as well.

 LP5562 device attributes: 'led_pattern' and 'engine_mux'
  A 'led_pattern' is an index code which runs the predefined pattern data.
  And 'engine_mux' is updated with the firmware interface is activated.
  Detailed description has been updated in the documentation files,
  'leds-lp55xx.txt' and 'leds-lp5562.txt'.

 Changes on the header file
  LP5562 configurable definitions are added.
  Pattern RGB data is fixed as constant value.
  (No side effect on other devices, LP5521 or LP5523.)
