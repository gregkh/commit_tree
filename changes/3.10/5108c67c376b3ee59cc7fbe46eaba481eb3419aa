arm64: Execute DSB during thread switching for TLB/cache maintenance

The DSB following TLB or cache maintenance ops must be run on the same
CPU. With kernel preemption enabled or for user-space cache maintenance
this may not be the case. This patch adds an explicit DSB in the
__switch_to() function.
