x86, vm86: fix VM86 syscalls: use SYSCALL_DEFINEx(...)

Commit 49cb25e9290 x86: 'get rid of pt_regs argument in vm86/vm86old'
got rid of the pt_regs stub for sys_vm86old and sys_vm86. The functions
were, however, not changed to use the calling convention for syscalls.

[AV: killed asmlinkage_protect() - it's done automatically now]
