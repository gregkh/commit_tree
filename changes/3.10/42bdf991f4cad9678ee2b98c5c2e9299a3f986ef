KVM: x86: fix maintenance of guest/host xcr0 state

Emulation of xcr0 writes zero guest_xcr0_loaded variable so that
subsequent VM-entry reloads CPU's xcr0 with guests xcr0 value.

However, this is incorrect because guest_xcr0_loaded variable is
read to decide whether to reload hosts xcr0.

In case the vcpu thread is scheduled out after the guest_xcr0_loaded = 0
assignment, and scheduler decides to preload FPU:

switch_to
{
  __switch_to
    __math_state_restore
      restore_fpu_checking
        fpu_restore_checking
          if (use_xsave())
              fpu_xrstor_checking
		xrstor64 with CPU's xcr0 == guests xcr0

Fix by properly restoring hosts xcr0 during emulation of xcr0 writes.
