memory: emif: errata i743: Prohibit usage of Power-Down mode

ERRATA DESCRIPTION :
The EMIF supports power-down state for low power. The EMIF
automatically puts the SDRAM into power-down after the memory is
not accessed for a defined number of cycles and the
EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[10:8] REG_LP_MODE bit field is set to 0x4.
As the EMIF supports automatic output impedance calibration, a ZQ
calibration long command is issued every time it exits active
power-down and precharge power-down modes. The EMIF waits and
blocks any other command during this calibration.
The EMIF does not allow selective disabling of ZQ calibration upon
exit of power-down mode. Due to very short periods of power-down
cycles, ZQ calibration overhead creates bandwidth issues and
increases overall system power consumption. On the other hand,
issuing ZQ calibration long commands when exiting self-refresh is
still required.

WORKAROUND :
Because there is no power consumption benefit of the power-down due
to the calibration and there is a performance risk, the guideline
is to not allow power-down state and, therefore, to not have set
the EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[10:8] REG_LP_MODE bit field to 0x4.

This is applicable only for EMIF4D IP used in OMAP4 Soc's.
