sh_eth: fix unused variable warning

Commit d5e07e69218fd9aa21d6c8c5ccc629d92bdb9b0f (sh_eth: use managed device API)
has caused this warning (due to my overlook):

drivers/net/ethernet/renesas/sh_eth.c: In function `sh_eth_drv_remove':
drivers/net/ethernet/renesas/sh_eth.c:2482:25: warning: unused variable `mdp'
[-Wunused-variable]

Kill the darn variable now...
