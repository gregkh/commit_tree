Btrfs: fix tree mod log regression on root split operations

Commit d9abbf1c changed tree mod log locking around ROOT_REPLACE operations.
When a tree root is split, however, we were logging removal of all elements
from the root node before logging removal of half of the elements for the
split operation. This leads to a BUG_ON when rewinding.

This commit removes the erroneous logging of removal of all elements.
