[jon-hunter@ti.com: Fix the problem caused by adding 32 to the interrupt
number for the L3 interrupts to account for per processor interrupts (PPI)
and software generated interrupts (SGI) which typically are mapped to the
first 32 interrupts in the ARM GIC. This is not necessary because the first
parameter of the ARM GIC interrupt property specifies the GIC interrupt
type (ie. SGI, PPI, etc). Hence, fix the interrupt number for the L3
interrupts by substracting 32]
