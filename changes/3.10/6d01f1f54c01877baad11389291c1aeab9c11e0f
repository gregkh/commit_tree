drm/qxl: make lots of things static.

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.7/include/stddef.h:414:9: sparse: preprocessor token offsetof redefined
include/linux/stddef.h:17:9: this was the original definition
>> drivers/gpu/drm/qxl/qxl_drv.c:49:5: sparse: symbol 'qxl_modeset' was not declared. Should it be static?
