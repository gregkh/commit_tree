net: fix sk_buff head without data area

Eric Dumazet spotted that we have to check skb->head instead
of skb->data as skb->head points to the beginning of the
data area of the skbuff. Similarly, we have to initialize the
skb->head pointer, not skb->data in __alloc_skb_head.

After this fix, netlink crashes in the release path of the
sk_buff, so let's fix that as well.

This bug was introduced in (0ebd0ac net: add function to
allocate sk_buff head without data area).
