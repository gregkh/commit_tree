ARM: dts: add mshc controller node for Exynos4x12 SoCs

Commit 800974ac ("ARM: dts: Add board dts file for ODROID-X") includes a node
to describe the board level properties for mshc controller. But the mshc
controller node was not added in the Exynos4x12 dtsi file which resulted
in the following warning when compiling the dtb files.

Warning (reg_format): "reg" property in /mshc@12550000/slot@0 has invalid length (4 bytes) (#address-cells == 2, #size-cells == 1)
Warning (avoid_default_addr_size): Relying on default #address-cells value for /mshc@12550000/slot@0
Warning (avoid_default_addr_size): Relying on default #size-cells value for /mshc@12550000/slot@0

Fix this by adding the mshc controller node for Exynos4x12 SoCs.
