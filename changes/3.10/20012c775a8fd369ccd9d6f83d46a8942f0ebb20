arm: omap: board-zoom: use NEC panel's gpio handling

The zoom board file currently requests gpios required by the nec-nl8048hl11-01
dpi panel, and provides dummy platform_enable/disable callbacks.

gpio request and configuration have been moved to the nec-nl8048hl11-01 panel
driver itself and shouldn't be done in the board files.

Remove the gpio requests and the platform callbacks from the board file. Add the
gpio information to panel_nec_nl8048_data so that it's passed to the panel
driver.
