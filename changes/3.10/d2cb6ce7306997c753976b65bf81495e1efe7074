be2net: Fix PVID tag offload for packets with inline VLAN tag.

BE3 HW in UMC mode could wrongly double tag a packet with PVID
when the packet already has a inlined VLAN tag.
In UMC mode, When HW finds that a packet is already VLAN tagged
PVID should not be inserted into the packet.
To fix this use the FW hack to instruct the HW to skip PVID tagging.
