Drivers: hv: balloon: Implement hot-add functionality

Implement the memory hot-add functionality. With this, Linux guests can fully
participate in the Dynamic Memory protocol implemented in the Windows hosts.

In this version of the patch, based Olaf Herring's feedback, I have gotten
rid of the module level dependency on MEMORY_HOTPLUG. Instead the code within
the driver that depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG has the appropriate compilation
switches. This would allow this driver to support pure ballooning in cases
where the kernel does not support memory hotplug.
