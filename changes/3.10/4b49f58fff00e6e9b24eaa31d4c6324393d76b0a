usbnet: handle link change

The link change is detected via the interrupt pipe, and bulk
pipes are responsible for transfering packets, so it is reasonable
to stop bulk transfer after link is reported as off.

Two adavantages may be obtained with stopping bulk transfer
after link becomes off:

- USB bus bandwidth is saved(USB bus is shared bus except for
USB3.0), for example, lots of 'IN' token packets and 'NYET'
handshake packets is transfered on 2.0 bus.

- probabaly power might be saved for usb host controller since
cancelling bulk transfer may disable the asynchronous schedule of
host controller.

With this patch, when link becomes off, about ~10% performance
boost can be found on bulk transfer of anther usb device which
is attached to same bus with the usbnet device, see below
test on next-20130410:

- read from usb mass storage(Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0) on pandaboard
with below command after unplugging ethernet cable:

	dd if=/dev/sda iflag=direct of=/dev/null bs=1M count=800
