aio: fix io_getevents documentation

In reviewing man pages, I noticed that io_getevents is documented to
update the timeout that gets passed into the library call.  This doesn't
happen in kernel space or in the library (even though it's documented to
do so in both places).  Unless there is objection, I'd like to fix the
comments/docs to match the code (I will also update the man page upon
consensus).
