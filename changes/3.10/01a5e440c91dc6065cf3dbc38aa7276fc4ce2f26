n_tty: Lock access to tty->pgrp for POSIX job control

Concurrent access to tty->pgrp must be protected with tty->ctrl_lock.
Also, as noted in the comments, reading current->signal->tty is
safe because either,
  1) current->signal->tty is assigned by current, or
  2) current->signal->tty is set to NULL.

NB: for reference, tty_check_change() implements a similar POSIX
check for the ioctls corresponding to tcflush(), tcdrain(),
tcsetattr(), tcsetpgrp(), tcflow() and tcsendbreak().
