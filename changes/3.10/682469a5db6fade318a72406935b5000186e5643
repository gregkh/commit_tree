x86, AMD: Correct {rd,wr}msr_amd_safe warnings

The idea with those routines is to slowly phase them out and not call
them on anything else besides K8. They even have a check for that which,
when called too early, fails. Let me explain:

It gets the cpuinfo_x86 pointer from the per_cpu array and when this
happens for cpu0, before its boot_cpu_data has been copied back to the
per_cpu array in smp_store_boot_cpu_info(), we get an empty struct and
thus the check fails.

Use boot_cpu_data directly instead.
