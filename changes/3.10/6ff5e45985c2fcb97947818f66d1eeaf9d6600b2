audit: move kaudit thread start from auditd registration to kaudit init

The kauditd_thread() task was started only after the auditd userspace daemon
registers itself with kaudit.  This was fine when only auditd consumed messages
from the kaudit netlink unicast socket.  With the addition of a multicast group
to that socket it is more convenient to have the thread start on init of the
kaudit kernel subsystem.
