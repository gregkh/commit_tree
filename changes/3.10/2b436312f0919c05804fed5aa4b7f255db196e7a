mac80211: fix queue handling crash

The code I added in "mac80211: don't start new netdev queues
if driver stopped" crashes for monitor and AP VLAN interfaces
because while they have a netdev, they don't have queues set
up by the driver.

To fix the crash, exclude these from queue accounting here
and just start their netdev queues unconditionally.

For monitor, this is the best we can do, as we can redirect
frames there to any other interface and don't know which one
that will since it can be different for each frame.

For AP VLAN interfaces, we can do better later and actually
properly track the queue status. Not doing this is really a
separate bug though.
