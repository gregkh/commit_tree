x86/olpc/xo1/sci: Don't call input_free_device() after input_unregister_device()

input_free_device() should only be used if
input_register_device() was not called yet or if it failed. Once
device was unregistered use input_unregister_device() and memory
will be freed once last reference to the device is dropped.
