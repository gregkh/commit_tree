ARM: EXYNOS: prepare an array of MCT interrupt numbers and use it

Instead of using soc_is_xxx macro at more than one place in
the MCT controller driver to decide the MCT interrpt number
to be setup, populate a table of known MCT global and local
timer interrupts and use the values in table to setup the MCT
interrupts.

This also helps in adding device tree support for MCT controller
driver by allowing the driver to retrieve interrupt numbers from
device tree and populating them into this table, thereby supporting
both legacy and dt functionality to co-exist.
