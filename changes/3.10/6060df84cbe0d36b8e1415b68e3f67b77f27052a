ARM: KVM: simplify HYP mapping population

The way we populate HYP mappings is a bit convoluted, to say the least.
Passing a pointer around to keep track of the current PFN is quite
odd, and we end-up having two different PTE accessors for no good
reason.

Simplify the whole thing by unifying the two PTE accessors, passing
a pgprot_t around, and moving the various validity checks to the
upper layers.
