rbd: set up watch in rbd_dev_image_probe()

Move setting up the watch request for an image so it's done in
rbd_dev_image_probe() rather than rbd_dev_probe_finish().  Move
it all the way up to before doing the initial probe.  This avoids
a potential race condition, in which we get (and use) the initial
snapshot context for an image, and it gets changed between that
time and the time we get the watch set up.

This resolves:
