powerpc: Fix usage of setup_pci_atmu()

Linux next is currently failing to compile mpc85xx_defconfig with:
  arch/powerpc/sysdev/fsl_pci.c:944:2: error: too many arguments to function 'setup_pci_atmu'

This is caused by (from Kumar's next branch):
  commit 34642bbb3d12121333efcf4ea7dfe66685e403a1
  Author: Kumar Gala <galak@kernel.crashing.org>
  powerpc/fsl-pci: Keep PCI SoC controller registers in pci_controller

Which changed definition of setup_pci_atmu() but didn't update one of
the callers.  Below fixes this.
