ASoC: davinci-mcasp: clean up davinci_hw_common_param()

As pointed of by Vaibhav, commit 2952b27e2 ("ASoC: davinci-mcasp:
Add support for multichannel playback") duplicated the logic of
counting the active serializers. That can be avoided by shifting
the code around a bit.

Also, drop two unused defines introduced by the same commit.
