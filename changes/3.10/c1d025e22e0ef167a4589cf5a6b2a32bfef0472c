binfmt_elf: PIE: make PF_RANDOMIZE check comment more accurate

The comment I originally added in commit a3defbe5c337 ("binfmt_elf: fix
PIE execution with randomization disabled") is not really 100% accurate
-- sysctl is not the only way how PF_RANDOMIZE could be forcibly unset
in runtime.

Another option of course is direct modification of personality flags
(i.e.  running through setarch wrapper).

Make the comment more explicit and accurate.
