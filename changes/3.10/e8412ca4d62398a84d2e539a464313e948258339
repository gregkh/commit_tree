ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Update latency based on DSP state.

The DSP in the CA0132 codec adds a variable latency to audio depending
on what processing is being done.  Add a new patch op to return that
latency for capture and playback streams.  The latency is determined
by which blocks are enabled and knowing how much latency is added by
each block.
