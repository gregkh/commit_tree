3c59x: fix freeing nonexistent resource on driver unload

When unloading the driver that drives an EISA board, a message similar to the
following one is displayed:

Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000000000013000-000000000001301f>

Then an user is unable to reload the driver because the resource it requested in
the previous load hasn't been freed. This happens most probably due to a typo in
vortex_eisa_remove() which calls release_region() with 'dev->base_addr'  instead
of 'edev->base_addr'...
