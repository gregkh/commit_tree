qlcnic: Fix reset recovery after transmit timeout

o When transmit timeout happens, recovery attempt should start with
  adapter soft reset. If soft reset fails to resume traffic, firmware
  dump will be collected and driver will perform a hard reset of the
  adapter. Reset recovery on 83xx was failing after a hard reset.
  This patch fixes that issue.
