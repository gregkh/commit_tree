[media] V4L: Remove incorrect EXPORT_SYMBOL() usage at v4l2-of.c

v4l2_of_parse_parallel_bus() function is now static and
EXPORT_SYMBOL() doesn't apply to it any more. Drop this
meaningless statement, which was supposed to be done in
the original merged patch.
While at it, edit the copyright notice so it is sorted in
both the v4l2-of.c and v4l2-of.h file in newest entries
on top order, and state clearly I'm just the author of
parts of the code, not the copyright owner.
