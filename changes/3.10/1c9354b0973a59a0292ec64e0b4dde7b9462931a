misc: apds9802als: Fix suspend/resume

The apds9802als driver implements runtime pm and at the same time uses the
legacy pm callbacks for suspend and resume. This does not work since the i2c
core wont look at the legacy pm callbacks if a driver has the 'pm' field set.
This patch fixes it by moving over to dev_pm_ops for suspend/resume as well.
Since both runtime pm and suspend/resume behave the same way this can easily be
done using the UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS macro.
