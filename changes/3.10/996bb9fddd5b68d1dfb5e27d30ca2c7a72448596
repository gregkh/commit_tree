ext4: support simple conversion of extent-mapped inodes to use i_blocks

In order to make it simpler to test the code which support
i_blocks/indirect-mapped inodes, support the conversion of inodes
which are less than 12 blocks and which are contained in no more than
a single extent.

The primary intended use of this code is to converting freshly created
zero-length files and empty directories.

Note that the version of chattr in e2fsprogs 1.42.7 and earlier has a
check that prevents the clearing of the extent flag.  A simple patch
which allows "chattr -e <file>" to work will be checked into the
e2fsprogs git repository.
