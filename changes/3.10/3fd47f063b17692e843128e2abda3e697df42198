powerpc/pci: Support per-aperture memory offset

The PCI core supports an offset per aperture nowadays but our arch
code still has a single offset per host bridge representing the
difference betwen CPU memory addresses and PCI MMIO addresses.

This is a problem as new machines and hypervisor versions are
coming out where the 64-bit windows will have a different offset
(basically mapped 1:1) from the 32-bit windows.

This fixes it by using separate offsets. In the long run, we probably
want to get rid of that intermediary struct pci_controller and have
those directly stored into the pci_host_bridge as they are parsed
but this will be a more invasive change.
