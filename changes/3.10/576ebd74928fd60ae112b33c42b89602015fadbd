kernel: Fix s390 absolute memory access for /dev/mem

On s390 the prefix page and absolute zero pages are not correctly
returned when reading /dev/mem. The reason is that the s390 asm/io.h
file includes the asm-generic/io.h file which then defines
xlate_dev_mem_ptr() and therefore overwrites the s390 specific
version that does the correct swap operation for prefix and absolute
zero pages. The problem is a regression that was introduced with git
commit cd248341 (s390/pci: base support).

To fix the problem add "#ifndef xlate_dev_mem_ptr" in asm-generic/io.h
and "#define xlate_dev_mem_ptr" in asm/io.h. This ensures that the
s390 version is used. For completeness also add the "#ifndef"
construct for xlate_dev_kmem_ptr().
