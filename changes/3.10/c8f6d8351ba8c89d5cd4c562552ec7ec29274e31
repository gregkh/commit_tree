ACPI / video: Add "Asus UL30A" to ACPI video detect blacklist

Like on UL30VT, the ACPI video driver can't control backlight correctly on
Asus UL30A.  Vendor driver (asus-laptop) can work.  This patch is to
add "Asus UL30A" to ACPI video detect blacklist in order to use
asus-laptop for video control on the "Asus UL30A" rather than ACPI
video driver.
