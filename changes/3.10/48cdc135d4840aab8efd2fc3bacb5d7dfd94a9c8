timekeeping: Implement a shadow timekeeper

Use the shadow timekeeper to do the update_wall_time() adjustments and
then copy it over to the real timekeeper.

Keep the shadow timekeeper in sync when updating stuff outside of
update_wall_time().

This allows us to limit the timekeeper_seq hold time to the update of
the real timekeeper and the vsyscall data in the next patch.
