workqueue: remove pwq_lock which is no longer used

To simplify locking, the previous patches expanded wq->mutex to
protect all fields of each workqueue instance including the pwqs list
leaving pwq_lock without any user.  Remove the unused pwq_lock.

tj: Rebased on top of the current dev branch.  Updated description.
