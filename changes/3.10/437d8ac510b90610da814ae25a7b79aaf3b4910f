ARM: EXYNOS: uncompress - print debug messages if DEBUG_LL is defined

Printing low-level debug messages make an assumption that the specified
UART port has been preconfigured by the bootloader. Incorrectly
specified UART port results in system getting stalled while printing the
message "Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel"
This UART port number is specified through S3C_LOWLEVEL_UART_PORT. Since
the UART port might different for different board, it is not possible to
specify it correctly for every board that use a common defconfig file.

Calling this print subroutine only when DEBUG_LL fixes the problem. By
disabling DEBUG_LL in default config file, we would be able to boot
multiple boards with different default UART ports.

With this current approach, we miss the print "Uncompressing Linux...
done, booting the kernel." when DEBUG_LL is not defined.
