USB: ftdi_sio: correct ST Micro Connect Lite PIDs

The current ST Micro Connect Lite uses the FT4232H hi-speed quad USB
UART FTDI chip. It is also possible to drive STM reference targets
populated with an on-board JTAG debugger based on the FT2232H chip with
the same STMicroelectronics tools.

For this reason, the ST Micro Connect Lite PIDs should be
ST_STMCLT_2232_PID: 0x3746
ST_STMCLT_4232_PID: 0x3747
