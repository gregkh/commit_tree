regulator: ab8500-ext: Remove get_voltage to avoid duplicate implementation

The implementation of ab8500_ext_fixed_get_voltage is identical to
ab8500_ext_list_voltage. We can avoid the duplicate implementation by just
remove get_voltage. For fixed regulator, regulator core will call
list_voltage(rdev, 0) to get voltage if both get_voltage get_voltage_sel are
not implemented.
