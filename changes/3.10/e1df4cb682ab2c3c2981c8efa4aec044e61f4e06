ftrace: Fix function probe to only enable needed functions

Currently the function probe enables all functions and runs a "hash"
against every function call to see if it should call a probe. This
is extremely wasteful.

Note, a probe is something like:

  echo schedule:traceoff > /debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter

When schedule is called, the probe will disable tracing. But currently,
it has a call back for *all* functions, and checks to see if the
called function is the probe that is needed.

The probe function has been created before ftrace was rewritten to
allow for more than one "op" to be registered by the function tracer.
When probes were created, it couldn't limit the functions without also
limiting normal function calls. But now we can, it's about time
to update the probe code.

Todo, have separate ops for different entries. That is, assign
a ftrace_ops per probe, instead of one op for all probes. But
as there's not many probes assigned, this may not be that urgent.
