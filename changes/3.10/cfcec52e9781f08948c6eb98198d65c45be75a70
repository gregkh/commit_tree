serial: 8250: Make SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS work correctly

Consider a situation where I have an ARM based system
and therefore no legacy ports. Say, I have two
memory-mapped ports. I use device tree to describe the
ports. What would be the config options I set so that
I get only the two ports in my system? I do not want
legacy ports being created automatically and I want
it to be flexible enough that it creates the devices
based only on the device tree. I expected setting
SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS = 0 to work because the
description said, "Set this to the maximum number of
serial ports you want the kernel to register at boot
time." Unfortunately, even though SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS
was set to the default value of 4, I did not get any device
nodes (because SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS was 0). This
is what this change is addressing.

SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS controls the maximum number of ports
you can support. SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS specifies the
number of ports you want to create automatically for legacy
ports at boot time. All other ports will be created
when serial8250_register_port is called (and if does not exceed
the total number of supported ports as specified by
SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS).
