driver/base: implement subsys_virtual_register()

Kay tells me the most appropriate place to expose workqueues to
userland would be /sys/devices/virtual/workqueues/WQ_NAME which is
symlinked to /sys/bus/workqueue/devices/WQ_NAME and that we're lacking
a way to do that outside of driver core as virtual_device_parent()
isn't exported and there's no inteface to conveniently create a
virtual subsystem.

This patch implements subsys_virtual_register() by factoring out
subsys_register() from subsys_system_register() and using it with
virtual_device_parent() as the origin directory.  It's identical to
subsys_system_register() other than the origin directory but we aren't
gonna restrict the device names which should be used under it.

This will be used to expose workqueue attributes to userland.
