drm/i915: revert eDP bpp clamping code changes

The behaviour around handling the eDP bpp value from vbt has been
slightly changed in

    drm/i915: convert DP autodither code to new infrastructure

The old behaviour was that we used the plane's bpp (usually 24bpp) for
computing the dp link bw, but set up the pipe with the bpp value from
vbt if available. This takes the vbt bpp override into account even
for the dp link bw configuration.

On Paulo's hsw machine this resulted in a slower link clock and a
black screen - but the mode actually /should/ fit even with the lower
clock. Until we've cleared up simply stay bug-for-bug compatible with
the old code.

While at it, also restore a debug message lost in:
