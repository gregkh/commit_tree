xfs: increase hexdump output in xfs_corruption_error

Currently xfs_corruption_error() dumps the first 16 bytes of the
buffer that is passed to it when a corruption occurs. This is not
large enough to see the entire state of the header of the block that
was determined to be corrupt.  increase the output to 64 bytes to
capture the majority of all headers in all types of metadata blocks.
