ALSA: snd-usb-audio: set the timeout for usb control set messages to 5000 ms

Set the timeout for USB control set messages according to the USB 2
spec, using the macros from include/linux/usb.h.
The get timout becomes 5000 ms even though it is 500 ms in the
spec. This patch is required to run the Hercules RMX2 which needs a
timeout of 1240 ms.

More notes from author:
I still distinguish between set and get but as long both are 5000 ms
GCC will remove it anyway. IMHO this is more easy read and there is no
need to explain why we use a get timeout for set messages.
