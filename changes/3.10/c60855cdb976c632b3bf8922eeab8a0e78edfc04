blkpm: avoid sleep when holding queue lock

In blk_post_runtime_resume, an autosuspend request will be initiated for
the device. Since we are holding the queue lock, we can't sleep and thus
we should use the async version to initiate an autosuspend, i.e.
pm_request_suspend instead of pm_runtime_suspend, which might sleep.
