[media] exynos4-is: Fix regulator/gpio resource releasing on the driver removal

Remove regulator_bulk_free() calls as devm_regulator_bulk_get() function
is used to get the regulators so those will be freed automatically while
the driver is removed.
Missing gpio free is fixed by requesting a gpio with the devm_* API.
All that is done now in the I2C client driver remove() callback is the
media entity cleanup call.
