net: mvmdio: rename base register cookie from smireg to regs

This patch renames the base register cookie in the mvmdio drive from
"smireg" to "regs" since a subsequent patch is going to use an ioremap()
cookie whose size is larger than a single register of 4 bytes. No
functionnal code change introduced.
