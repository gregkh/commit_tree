rbd: simplify rbd_dev_v1_probe()

An rbd_dev structure's fields are all zero-filled for an initial
probe, so there's no need to explicitly zero the parent_spec
and parent_overlap fields in rbd_dev_v1_probe().  Removing these
assignments makes rbd_dev_v1_probe() *almost* trivial.

Move the dout() message that announces discovery of an image into
rbd_dev_image_probe(), generalize to support images in either format
and only show it if an image is fully discovered.

This highlights that are some unnecessary cleanups in the error
path for rbd_dev_v1_probe(), so they can be removed.

Now rbd_dev_v1_probe() *is* a trivial wrapper function.
