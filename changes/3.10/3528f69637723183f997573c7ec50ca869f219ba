IB/mlx4: Set link type for RAW PACKET QPs in the QP context

When the link type is Ethernet, setting the link type in the QP
context will enable TCP/IP stateless offloads (checksum, LSO, RSS) for
RAW PACKET Ethernet QPs.  For IB UD QPs this worked OK since the value
assumed by the firmware for IB link layer is zero.
