ARM: arch_timer: Silence debug preempt warnings

Hot-plugging with CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y on a device with arm
architected timers causes a slew of "using smp_processor_id() in
preemptible" warnings:

  BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: sh/111
  caller is arch_timer_cpu_notify+0x14/0xc8

This happens because sometimes the cpu notifier,
arch_timer_cpu_notify(), is called in preemptible context and
other times in non-preemptible context but we use this_cpu_ptr()
to retrieve the clockevent in all cases. We're only going to
actually use the pointer in non-preemptible context though, so
push the this_cpu_ptr() access down into the cases to force the
checks to occur only in non-preemptible contexts.
