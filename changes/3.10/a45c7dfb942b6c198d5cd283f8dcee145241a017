merge_config.sh: Avoid creating unnessary source softlinks

Viresh noticed when using merge_config.sh that a source softlink
was being created even when he didn't specify the -O option.

The problem arises due to the previous commit 409f117e2d6b
which added the -O option. Basically if -O is not specified,
we still pass '-O=.' to the make command, which then generates
a source softlink to ./

This patch adds an extra check so if there is no -O specified
to merge_config.sh, we don't pass one on to make.
