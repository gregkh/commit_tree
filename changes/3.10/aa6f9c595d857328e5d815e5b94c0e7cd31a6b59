ntp: Move do_adjtimex() and hardpps() functions to timekeeping.c

In preparation for changing the ntp locking rules, move
do_adjtimex and hardpps accessor functions to timekeeping.c,
but keep the code logic in ntp.c.

This patch also introduces a ntp_internal.h file so timekeeping
specific interfaces of ntp.c can be more limitedly shared with
timekeeping.c.
