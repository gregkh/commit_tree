[media] r820t: Allow disabling IMR callibration

The rtl-sdr library disabled IMR callibration. While I'm not sure
yet why, it could be a good idea to add a modprobe parameter here,
to allow to also disable it. There are two rationale behind it:
- It helps to compare USB dumps between rtl-sdr and the Kernel module;
- If rtl-sdr disabled it, perhaps there's a good reason (e. g. it
  might not be actually working, or it might be causing some trouble).
For both cases, it seems useful to add a modprobe parameter to allow
testing the device with both configurations.
