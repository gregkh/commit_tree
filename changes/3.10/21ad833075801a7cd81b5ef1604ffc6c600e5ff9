drm/i915: Fix races in gen4 page flip interrupt handling

Use the gen3 logic for handling page flip interrupts on gen4.

Unfortuantely this kills the stall_check since that looks like it can
easily trigger too early. With the current logic the stall check would
kick in on the first vblank after the flip has been submitted to the
ring. If the CS takes longer than that to process the commands in the
ring, the stall check will cause the page flip to be complete too
early. That doesn't sound like a very good idea. Something better
should be deviced if we still need the stall check. For now, mark
i915_pageflip_stall_check() as unused.
