HID: appleir: add support for Apple ir devices

This driver was originally written by James McKenzie, updated by
Greg Kroah-Hartman, further updated by Bastien Nocera, with suspend
support added.
I ported it to the HID subsystem, in order to simplify it a litle
and allow lirc to use it through hiddev.

More recent versions of the IR receiver are also supported through
a patch by Alex Karpenko. The patch also adds support for the 2nd
and 5th generation of the controller, and the menu key on newer
brushed metal remotes.
