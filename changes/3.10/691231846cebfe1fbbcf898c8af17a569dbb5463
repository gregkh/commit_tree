powerpc/perf: Fix setting of "to" addresses for BHRB

Currently we only set the "to" address in the branch stack when the CPU
explicitly gives us a value.  Unfortunately it only does this for XL form
branches (eg blr, bctr, bctar) and not I and B form branches (eg b, bc).

Fortunately if we read the instruction from memory we can extract the offset of
a branch and calculate the target address.

This adds a function power_pmu_bhrb_to() to calculate the target/to address of
the corresponding I and B form branches.  It handles branches in both user and
kernel spaces.  It also plumbs this into the perf brhb reading code.
