[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix displaying the FW Version from driver.

The mgmt_hba_attributes structure declared was not proper and
because of that the FW response returned for the MBX_CMD was not
matching. This issue went unnoticed as mgmt_hba_attribs structure
members were never used in the code path.

This fix of displaying the FW version had to change the mgmt_hba_attrib
structure also. The latest driver will also work with the older FW as
the issue was in the driver declaration.
