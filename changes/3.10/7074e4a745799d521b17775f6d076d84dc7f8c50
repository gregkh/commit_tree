drbd: only fail empty flushes if no good data is reachable

We completed empty flushes (blkdev_issue_flush()) with IO error
if we lost the local disk, even if we still have an established
replication link to a healthy remote disk.

Fix this to only report errors to upper layers,
if neither local nor remote data is reachable.
