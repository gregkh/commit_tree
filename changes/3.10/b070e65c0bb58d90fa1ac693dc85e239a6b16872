mm, memcg: add rss_huge stat to memory.stat

This exports the amount of anonymous transparent hugepages for each
memcg via the new "rss_huge" stat in memory.stat.  The units are in
bytes.

This is helpful to determine the hugepage utilization for individual
jobs on the system in comparison to rss and opportunities where
MADV_HUGEPAGE may be helpful.

The amount of anonymous transparent hugepages is also included in "rss"
for backwards compatibility.
