libceph: clean up osd data field access functions

There are a bunch of functions defined to encapsulate getting the
address of a data field for a particular op in an osd request.
They're all defined the same way, so create a macro to take the
place of all of them.

Two of these are used outside the osd client code, so preserve them
(but convert them to use the new macro internally).  Stop exporting
the ones that aren't used elsewhere.
