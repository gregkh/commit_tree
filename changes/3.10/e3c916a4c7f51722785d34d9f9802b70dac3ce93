workqueue: drop 'H' from kworker names of unbound worker pools

Currently, all workqueue workers which have negative nice value has
'H' postfixed to their names.  This is necessary for per-cpu workers
as they use the CPU number instead of pool->id to identify the pool
and the 'H' postfix is the only thing distinguishing normal and
highpri workers.

As workers for unbound pools use pool->id, the 'H' postfix is purely
informational.  TASK_COMM_LEN is 16 and after the static part and
delimiters, there are only five characters left for the pool and
worker IDs.  We're expecting to have more unbound pools with the
scheduled NUMA awareness support.  Let's drop the non-essential 'H'
postfix from unbound kworker name.

While at it, restructure kthread_create*() invocation to help future
NUMA related changes.
