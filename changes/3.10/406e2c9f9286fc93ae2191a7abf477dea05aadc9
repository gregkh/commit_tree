libceph: kill off osd data write_request parameters

In the incremental move toward supporting distinct data items in an
osd request some of the functions had "write_request" parameters to
indicate, basically, whether the data belonged to in_data or the
out_data.  Now that we maintain the data fields in the op structure
there is no need to indicate the direction, so get rid of the
"write_request" parameters.
