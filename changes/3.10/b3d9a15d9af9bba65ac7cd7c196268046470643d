[media] soc_camera: remove two outdated selects

Release v2.6.30 removed the MT9M001_PCA9536_SWITCH and
MT9V022_PCA9536_SWITCH Kconfig symbols, in commits
36034dc325ecab63c8cfb992fbf9a1a8e94738a2 ("V4L/DVB (11032): mt9m001:
allow setting of bus width from board code") and
e958e27adeade7fa085dd396a8a0dfaef7e338c1 ("V4L/DVB (11033): mt9v022:
allow setting of bus width from board code").
These two commits removed all gpio related code from these two drivers.
But they skipped removing their two selects of GPIO_PCA953X. Remove
these now as they are outdated. Their dependencies can never evaluate to
true anyhow.
