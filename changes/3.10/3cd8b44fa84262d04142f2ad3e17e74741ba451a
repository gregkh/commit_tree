hugetlb: fix sparse warning for hugetlb_register_node

Removed the following sparse warnings:
*  mm/hugetlb.c:1764:6: warning: symbol
    'hugetlb_unregister_node' was not declared.
    Should it be static?
*   mm/hugetlb.c:1808:6: warning: symbol
    'hugetlb_register_node' was not declared.
    Should it be static?
