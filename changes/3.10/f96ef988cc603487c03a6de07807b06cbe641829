ipv4: fix redirect handling for TCP packets

Unlike ipv4_redirect() and ipv4_sk_redirect(), ip_do_redirect()
doesn't call __build_flow_key() directly but via
ip_rt_build_flow_key() wrapper. This leads to __build_flow_key()
getting pointer to IPv4 header of the ICMP redirect packet
rather than pointer to the embedded IPv4 header of the packet
initiating the redirect.

As a result, handling of ICMP redirects initiated by TCP packets
is broken. Issue was introduced by

	4895c771c ("ipv4: Add FIB nexthop exceptions.")
