powerpc/pseries: Use ARRAY_SIZE to iterate over firmware_features_table array

When iterating over the entries in firmware_features_table we only need
to go over the actual number of entries in the array instead of declaring
it to be bigger and checking to make sure there is a valid entry in every
slot.

This patch removes the FIRMWARE_MAX_FEATURES #define and replaces the
array looping with the use of ARRAY_SIZE().
