make vfree() safe to call from interrupt contexts

A bunch of RCU callbacks want to be able to do vfree() and end up with
rather kludgy schemes.  Just let vfree() do the right thing - put the
victim on llist and schedule actual __vunmap() via schedule_work(), so
that it runs from non-interrupt context.
