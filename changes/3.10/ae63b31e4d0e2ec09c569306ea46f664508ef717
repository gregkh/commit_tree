tracing: Separate out trace events from global variables

The trace events for ftrace are all defined via global variables.
The arrays of events and event systems are linked to a global list.
This prevents multiple users of the event system (what to enable and
what not to).

By adding descriptors to represent the event/file relation, as well
as to which trace_array descriptor they are associated with, allows
for more than one set of events to be defined. Once the trace events
files have a link between the trace event and the trace_array they
are associated with, we can create multiple trace_arrays that can
record separate events in separate buffers.
