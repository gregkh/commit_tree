vxlan: don't bypass encapsulation for multi- and broadcasts

The multicast and broadcast packets may have RTCF_LOCAL set in rt_flags
and therefore will be sent out bypassing encapsulation. This breaks
delivery of packets sent to the vxlan multicast group.
Disabling encapsulation bypass for multicasts and broadcasts fixes the
issue.
