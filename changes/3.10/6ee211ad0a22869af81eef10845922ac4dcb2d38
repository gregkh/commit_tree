cgroup: don't bother to resize pid array

When we open cgroup.procs, we'll allocate an buffer and store all tasks'
tgid in it, and then duplicate entries will be stripped. If that results
in a much smaller pid list, we'll re-allocate a smaller buffer.

But we've already sucessfully allocated memory and reading the procs
file is a short period and the memory will be freed very soon, so why
bother to re-allocate memory.
