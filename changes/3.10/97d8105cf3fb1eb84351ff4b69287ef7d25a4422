qlcnic: VF FLR implementation.

o FLR from Hypervisor - When hypervisor issues a VF FLR request,
  adapter notifies the parent PF driver of the FLR request for PF
  driver to perform any cleanup on behalf of that VF.
o FLR from VF Driver - VF driver may initiate a VF FLR request,
  if VF state needs to be cleaned up before a re-initialization.
  VF re-initialization during kdump is an example.
o PF driver cleans up all resources allocated on behalf of a  VF,
  on VF FLR notifications from the adapter or from the VF driver.
