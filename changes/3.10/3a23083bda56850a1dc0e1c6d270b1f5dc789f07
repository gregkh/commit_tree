libceph: implement RECONNECT_SEQ feature

This is an old protocol extension that allows the client and server to
avoid resending old messages after a reconnect (following a socket error).
Instead, the exchange their sequence numbers during the handshake.  This
avoids sending a bunch of useless data over the socket.

It has been supported in the server code since v0.22 (Sep 2010).
