sound: Fix make allmodconfig on MIPS correctly

Commit d4702b189c ("sound: Fix make allmodconfig on MIPS") added a
(negative) dependency on ISA_DMA_SUPPORT_BROKEN. Since that Kconfig
symbol doesn't exist, this dependency will always evaluate to true.
Apparently GENERIC_ISA_DMA_SUPPORT_BROKEN was meant to be used here.
