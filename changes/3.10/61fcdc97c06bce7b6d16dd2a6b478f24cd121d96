libceph: no outbound zero data

There is handling in write_partial_message_data() for the case where
only the length of--and no other information about--the data to be
sent has been specified.  It uses the zero page as the source of
data to send in this case.

This case doesn't occur.  All message senders set up a page array,
pagelist, or bio describing the data to be sent.  So eliminate the
block of code that handles this (but check and issue a warning for
now, just in case it happens for some reason).

This resolves:
