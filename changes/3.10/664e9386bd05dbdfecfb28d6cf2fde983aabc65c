vfio: Set container device mode

Minor 0 is the VFIO container device (/dev/vfio/vfio).  On it's own
the container does not provide a user with any privileged access.  It
only supports API version check and extension check ioctls.  Only by
attaching a VFIO group to the container does it gain any access.  Set
the mode of the container to allow access.
