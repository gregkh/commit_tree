cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: Call CPUFREQ_POSTCHANGE notifier for failure cases too

Currently we are simply returning from target() if we encounter some error after
broadcasting CPUFREQ_PRECHANGE notifier. Which looks to be wrong as others might
depend on POSTCHANGE notifier for their functioning.

So, better broadcast CPUFREQ_POSTCHANGE notifier for these failure cases too,
but with old frequency.
