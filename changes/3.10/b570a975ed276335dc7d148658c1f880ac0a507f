NFSv4: Fix handling of revoked delegations by setattr

Currently, _nfs4_do_setattr() will use the delegation stateid if no
writeable open file stateid is available.
If the server revokes that delegation stateid, then the call to
nfs4_handle_exception() will fail to handle the error due to the
lack of a struct nfs4_state, and will just convert the error into
an EIO.

This patch just removes the requirement that we must have a
struct nfs4_state in order to invalidate the delegation and
retry.
