Bluetooth: hidp: fix sending output reports on intr channel

According to the specifications, data output reports must be sent on the
interrupt channel. See also usbhid implementation.
Sending these reports on the control channel breaks newer Wii Remotes.

Note that this will make output reports asynchronous. However, that's how
hid_output_raw_report() is supposed to work with HID_OUTPUT_REPORT as
report type. There are no responses to output reports.
