move cgroupfs_root to include/linux/cgroup.h

While controllers shouldn't be accessing cgroupfs_root directly, it
being hidden inside kern/cgroup.c makes somethings pretty silly.  This
makes routing hierarchy-wide settings which need to be visible to
controllers cumbersome.

We're gonna add another hierarchy-wide setting which needs to be
accessed from controllers.  Move cgroupfs_root and its flags to the
header file so that we can access root settings with inline helpers.
