perf/x86: Add Sandy Bridge constraints for CYCLE_ACTIVITY.*

Add CYCLE_ACTIVITY.CYCLES_NO_DISPATCH/CYCLES_L1D_PENDING constraints.

These recently documented events have restrictions to counter
0-3 and counter 2 respectively. The perf scheduler needs to know
that to schedule them correctly.

IvyBridge already has the necessary constraints.
