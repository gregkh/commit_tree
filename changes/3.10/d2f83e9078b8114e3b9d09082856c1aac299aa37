Hoist memcpy_fromiovec/memcpy_toiovec into lib/

ERROR: "memcpy_fromiovec" [drivers/vhost/vhost_scsi.ko] undefined!

That function is only present with CONFIG_NET.  Turns out that
crypto/algif_skcipher.c also uses that outside net, but it actually
needs sockets anyway.

In addition, commit 6d4f0139d642c45411a47879325891ce2a7c164a added
CONFIG_NET dependency to CONFIG_VMCI for memcpy_toiovec, so hoist
that function and revert that commit too.

socket.h already includes uio.h, so no callers need updating; trying
only broke things fo x86_64 randconfig (thanks Fengguang!).
