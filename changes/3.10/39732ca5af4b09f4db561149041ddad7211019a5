epoll: trim epitem by one cache line

It is common for epoll users to have thousands of epitems, so saving a
cache line on every allocation leads to large memory savings.

Since epitem allocations are cache-aligned, reducing sizeof(struct
epitem) from 136 bytes to 128 bytes will allow it to squeeze under a
cache line boundary on x86_64.

Via /sys/kernel/slab/eventpoll_epi, I see the following changes on my
x86_64 Core2 Duo (which has 64-byte cache alignment):

	object_size  :  192 => 128
	objs_per_slab:   21 =>  32

Also, add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to check for future accidental breakage.
