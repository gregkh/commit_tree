gpio-langwell: fix irq conflicts when DT is not used

When DT is not used IOAPIC does not register irq domain. As result
IOAPIC won't care about gpio-langwell's virq and may cause conflict if
an irq number is equal to gpio-langwell's virq mapped beforehand.

This patch tells gpio_langwell to not ignore irq_base if != 0 and
preferably use it to avoid the conflict.

If DT is used, irq_base can safely be 0.
