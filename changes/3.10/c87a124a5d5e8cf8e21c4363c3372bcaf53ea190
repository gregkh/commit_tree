net: force a reload of first item in hlist_nulls_for_each_entry_rcu

Roman Gushchin discovered that udp4_lib_lookup2() was not reloading
first item in the rcu protected list, in case the loop was restarted.

This produced soft lockups as in https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/16/37

rcu_dereference(X)/ACCESS_ONCE(X) seem to not work as intended if X is
ptr->field :

In some cases, gcc caches the value or ptr->field in a register.

Use a barrier() to disallow such caching, as documented in
Documentation/atomic_ops.txt line 114

Thanks a lot to Roman for providing analysis and numerous patches.
