proc: Supply an accessor for getting the data from a PDE's parent

Supply an accessor function for getting the private data from the parent
proc_dir_entry struct of the proc_dir_entry struct associated with an inode.

ReiserFS, for instance, stores the super_block pointer in the proc directory
it makes for that super_block, and a pointer to the respective seq_file show
function in each of the proc files in that directory.

This allows a reduction in the number of file_operations structs, open
functions and seq_operations structs required.  The problem otherwise is that
each show function requires two pieces of data but only has storage for one
per PDE (and this has no release function).
