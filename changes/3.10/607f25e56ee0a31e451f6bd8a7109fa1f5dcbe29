drbd: fix drbd epoch write count for ahead/behind mode

The sanity check when receiving P_BARRIER_ACK does expect all write
requests with a given req->epoch to have been either all replicated,
or all not replicated.

Because req->epoch was assigned before calling maybe_pull_ahead(),
this expectation was not met, leading to an off-by-one in the sanity
check, and further to a "Protocol Error".

Fix: move the call to maybe_pull_ahead() a few lines up,
and assign req->epoch only after that.
