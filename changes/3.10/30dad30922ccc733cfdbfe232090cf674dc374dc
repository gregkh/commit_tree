mm: migration: add migrate_entry_wait_huge()

When we have a page fault for the address which is backed by a hugepage
under migration, the kernel can't wait correctly and do busy looping on
hugepage fault until the migration finishes.  As a result, users who try
to kick hugepage migration (via soft offlining, for example) occasionally
experience long delay or soft lockup.

This is because pte_offset_map_lock() can't get a correct migration entry
or a correct page table lock for hugepage.  This patch introduces
migration_entry_wait_huge() to solve this.
