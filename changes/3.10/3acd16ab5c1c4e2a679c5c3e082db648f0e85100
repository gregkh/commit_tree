[media] go7007: switch to standard tuner/i2c subdevs

Instead of using the wis-* drivers we now use the standard 'proper' subdev
drivers.
The board configuration tables now also list the possible audio inputs,
this will be used later to implement audio inputs.
Special mention deserves a little change in set_capture_size() where the
height passed to s_mbus_fmt is doubled: that is because the saa7115 driver
expects to see the frame height, not the field height as the wis_saa7115
driver did.
Another change is that the tuner input is moved from last to the first
input, which is consistent with the common practice in other video drivers.
