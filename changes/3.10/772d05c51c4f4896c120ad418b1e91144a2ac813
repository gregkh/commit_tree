e1000e: slow performance between two 82579 connected via 10Mbit hub

Two 82579 LOMs connected via a 10Mb hub experience extraordinarily low
performance.  This is because 82579 is excessively aggressive on transmit
at 10Mb half-duplex and will not provide sufficient time for the link
partner to transmit.  When the link partner is also 82579, the result is a
lot of collisions (and corresponding re-transmits) that cause the poor
performance. To work-around this issue, significantly increase the IPG in
the MAC to allow enough gap for the link partner to transmit and reduce the
Rx latency in the analog PHY to 0 to reduce the number of collisions.
