KVM: VMX: fix halt emulation while emulating invalid guest sate

The invalid guest state emulation loop does not check halt_request
which causes 100% cpu loop while guest is in halt and in invalid
state, but more serious issue is that this leaves halt_request set, so
random instruction emulated by vm86 #GP exit can be interpreted
as halt which causes guest hang. Fix both problems by handling
halt_request in emulation loop.
