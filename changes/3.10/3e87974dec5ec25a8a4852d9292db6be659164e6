ARC: Brown paper bag bug in macro for checking cache color

The VM_EXEC check in update_mmu_cache() was getting optimized away
because of a stupid error in definition of macro addr_not_cache_congruent()

The intention was to have the equivalent of following:

	if (a || (1 ? b : 0))

but we ended up with following:

	if (a || 1 ? b : 0)

And because precedence of '||' is more that that of '?', gcc was optimizing
away evaluation of <a>

Nasty Repercussions:
1. For non-aliasing configs it would mean some extraneous dcache flushes
   for non-code pages if U/K mappings were not congruent.
2. For aliasing config, some needed dcache flush for code pages might
   be missed if U/K mappings were congruent.
