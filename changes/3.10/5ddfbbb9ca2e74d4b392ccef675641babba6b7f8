[media] cx88: Fix unsafe locking in suspend-resume

Legacy PCI suspend-resume handlers are called with interrupts enabled.

But cx8800_suspend/cx8800_resume and
cx8802_suspend_common/cx8802_resume_common use spin_lock/spin_unlock
functions to acquire dev->slock, while the same lock is acquired in the
corresponding irq-handlers: cx8800_irq and cx8802_irq.

That means a deadlock is possible if an interrupt happens while suspend
or resume owns the lock. The patch replaces spin_lock/spin_unlock with
spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_irqrestore.
