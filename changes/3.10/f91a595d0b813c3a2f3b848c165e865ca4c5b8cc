memory: emif: Handle devices which are not rated for >85C

As per JESD209-2E specification for LPDDR2,
      http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/results/jesd209-2E
Table 73, LPDDR2 memories come in two flavors - Standard and
Extended. The Standard types can operate from -25C to +85C
However, beyond that and upto +105C can only be supported by
Extended types.

Unfortunately, it seems there is no info in MR0(device info) or
MR[1,2](device feature) for run time detection of this capability
as far as seen on the spec. Hence, we provide a custom_config
flag to be populated by platforms which have these "extended"
type memories.

For the "Standard" memories, we need to consider MR4 notifications
of temperature triggers >85C as equivalent to thermal shutdown
events (equivalent to Spec specified thermal shutdown events for
"extended" parts).
