rbd: enforce parent overlap

A clone image has a defined overlap point with its parent image.
That is the byte offset beyond which the parent image has no
defined data to back the clone, and anything thereafter can be
viewed as being zero-filled by the clone image.

This is needed because a clone image can be resized.  If it gets
resized larger than the snapshot it is based on, the overlap defines
the original size.  If the clone gets resized downward below the
original size the new clone size defines the overlap.  If the clone
is subsequently resized to be larger, the overlap won't be increased
because the previous resize invalidated any parent data beyond that
point.
