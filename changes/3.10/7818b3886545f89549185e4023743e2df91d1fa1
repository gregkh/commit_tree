ftrace: Use manual free after synchronize_sched() not call_rcu_sched()

The entries to the probe hash must be freed after a synchronize_sched()
after the entry has been removed from the hash.

As the entries are registered with ops that may have their own callbacks,
and these callbacks may sleep, we can not use call_rcu_sched() because
the rcu callbacks registered with that are called from a softirq context.

Instead of using call_rcu_sched(), manually save the entries on a free_list
and at the end of the loop that removes the entries, do a synchronize_sched()
and then go through the free_list, freeing the entries.
