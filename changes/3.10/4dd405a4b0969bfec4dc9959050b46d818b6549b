USB: EHCI: improve use of per-port status-change bits

This patch (as1634) simplifies some of the code associated with the
per-port change bits added in EHCI-1.1, and in particular it fixes a
bug in the logic of ehci_hub_status_data().  Even if the change bit
doesn't indicate anything happened on a particular port, we still have
to notify the core about changes to the suspend or reset status.
