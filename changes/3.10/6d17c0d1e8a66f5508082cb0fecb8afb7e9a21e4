KVM/MIPS32: Wrap calls to gfn_to_pfn() with srcu_read_lock/unlock()

- As suggested by Gleb, wrap calls to gfn_to_pfn() with srcu_read_lock/unlock().
  Memory slots should be acccessed from a SRCU read section.
- kvm_mips_map_page() now returns an error code to it's callers, instead of
  calling panic() if it cannot find a mapping for a particular gfn.
