fuse: truncate file if async dio failed

The patch improves error handling in fuse_direct_IO(): if we successfully
submitted several fuse requests on behalf of synchronous direct write
extending file and some of them failed, let's try to do our best to clean-up.

Changed in v2: reuse fuse_do_setattr(). Thanks to Brian for suggestion.
