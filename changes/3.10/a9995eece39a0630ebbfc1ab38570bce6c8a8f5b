Btrfs: init relocate extent_io_tree with a mapping

Dave reported a NULL pointer deref.  This is caused because he thought he'd be
smart and add sanity checks to the extent_io bit operations, but he didn't
expect a tree to have a NULL mapping.  To fix this we just need to init the
relocation's processed_blocks with the btree_inode->i_mapping.  Thanks,
