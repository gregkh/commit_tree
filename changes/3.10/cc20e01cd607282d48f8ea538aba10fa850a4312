cgroup: fix use-after-free when umounting cgroupfs

Try:
  # mount -t cgroup xxx /cgroup
  # mkdir /cgroup/sub && rmdir /cgroup/sub && umount /cgroup

And you might see this:

ida_remove called for id=1 which is not allocated.

It's because cgroup_kill_sb() is called to destroy root->cgroup_ida
and free cgrp->root before ida_simple_removed() is called. What's
worse is we're accessing cgrp->root while it has been freed.
