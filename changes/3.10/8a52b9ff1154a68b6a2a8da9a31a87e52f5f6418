ioatdma: channel reset scheme fixup on Intel Atom S1200 platforms

The Intel Atom S1200 family ioatdma changed the channel reset behavior.
It does a reset similar to PCI FLR by resetting all the MSIX
registers. We have to re-init msix interrupts because of this. This
workaround is only specific to this platform and is not expected to carry
over to the later generations.
