ASoC: tegra: add Tegra114 support to tegra_asoc_utils.c

Tegra114 requires different PLL rates. Modify the code to know about
this.

On Tegra114 only for now, use regular clk_get() rather than clk_get_sys()
to retrieve clocks. This assumes that the clocks will be represented in
device tree. We can assure that from the start of any Tegra114 audio
support. For older chips, I'll add the required clocks properties to the
device trees this kernel cycle, and switch this code to only support the
"new_clocks" path next cycle.
