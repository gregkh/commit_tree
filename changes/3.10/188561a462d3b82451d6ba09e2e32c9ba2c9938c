s390/cio: wait_cons_dev don't use static variable

wait_cons_dev is used to busy wait for an interrupt on the console
ccw device. Stop using the static console_subchannel and add a
parameter to this function to specify on which ccw device/subchannel
we have to do the polling.

While at it rename the function to ccw_device_wait_idle and
move it to device.c
