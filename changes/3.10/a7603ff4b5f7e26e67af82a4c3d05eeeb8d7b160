tracing: Replace the static global per_cpu arrays with allocated per_cpu

The global and max-tr currently use static per_cpu arrays for the CPU data
descriptors. But in order to get new allocated trace_arrays, they need to
be allocated per_cpu arrays. Instead of using the static arrays, switch
the global and max-tr to use allocated data.
