regulator: ab8500-ext: Remove unused REGULATOR_AB8500_EXT guard

Before the AB8500 External Regulator driver was Mainlined, it used
to be conditionally compiled in using the CONFIG_REGULATOR_AB8500_EXT
flag. During the review process that capability was removed, but the
guard controlling prototyping slipped though the net. This patch
cleans it up.
