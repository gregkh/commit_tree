crypto: caam - fix typo "CRYPTO_AHASH"

The Kconfig entry for CAAM's hash algorithm implementations has always
selected CRYPTO_AHASH. But there's no corresponding Kconfig symbol.

It seems it was intended to select CRYPTO_HASH, like other crypto
drivers do. That would apparently (indirectly) select CRYPTO_HASH2,
which would enable the ahash functionality this driver uses.
