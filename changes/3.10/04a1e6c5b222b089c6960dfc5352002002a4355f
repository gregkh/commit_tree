xfs: add CRC checks to the superblock

With the addition of CRCs, there is such a wide and varied change to
the on disk format that it makes sense to bump the superblock
version number rather than try to use feature bits for all the new
functionality.

This commit introduces all the new superblock fields needed for all
the new functionality: feature masks similar to ext4, separate
project quota inodes, a LSN field for recovery and the CRC field.

This commit does not bump the superblock version number, however.
That will be done as a separate commit at the end of the series
after all the new functionality is present so we switch it all on in
one commit. This means that we can slowly introduce the changes
without them being active and hence maintain bisectability of the
tree.

This patch is based on a patch originally written by myself back
from SGI days, which was subsequently modified by Christoph Hellwig.
There is relatively little of that patch remaining, but the history
of the patch still should be acknowledged here.
