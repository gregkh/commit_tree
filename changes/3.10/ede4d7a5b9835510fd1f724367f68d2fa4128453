gpio/omap: convert gpio irq domain to linear mapping

Currently the OMAP GPIO driver uses a legacy mapping for the GPIO IRQ
domain. This is not necessary because we do not need to assign a
specific interrupt number to the GPIO IRQ domain. Therefore, convert
the OMAP GPIO driver to use a linear mapping instead.

Please note that this also allows to simplify the logic in the OMAP
gpio_irq_handler() routine, by using irq_find_mapping() to obtain the
virtual irq number from the GPIO bank and bank index.
