mm: make snapshotting pages for stable writes a per-bio operation

Walking a bio's page mappings has proved problematic, so create a new
bio flag to indicate that a bio's data needs to be snapshotted in order
to guarantee stable pages during writeback.  Next, for the one user
(ext3/jbd) of snapshotting, hook all the places where writes can be
initiated without PG_writeback set, and set BIO_SNAP_STABLE there.

We must also flag journal "metadata" bios for stable writeout, since
file data can be written through the journal.  Finally, the
MS_SNAP_STABLE mount flag (only used by ext3) is now superfluous, so get
rid of it.
