	    cpufreq: handle SW coordinated CPUs

This causes additional unnecessary interrupts on all cpus when the load is
recently evaluated by any other cpu. i.e. When load is recently evaluated by cpu
x, we don't really need any other cpu to evaluate this load again for the next
sampling_rate time.

Some sort of code is present to avoid that but we are still getting timer
interrupts for all cpus. A good way of avoiding this would be to modify delays
for all cpus (policy->cpus) whenever any cpu has evaluated load.

This patch does this change and some related code cleanup.
