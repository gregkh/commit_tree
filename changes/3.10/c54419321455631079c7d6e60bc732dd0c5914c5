GRE: Refactor GRE tunneling code.

Following patch refactors GRE code into ip tunneling code and GRE
specific code. Common tunneling code is moved to ip_tunnel module.
ip_tunnel module is written as generic library which can be used
by different tunneling implementations.

ip_tunnel module contains following components:
 - packet xmit and rcv generic code. xmit flow looks like
   (gre_xmit/ipip_xmit)->ip_tunnel_xmit->ip_local_out.
 - hash table of all devices.
 - lookup for tunnel devices.
 - control plane operations like device create, destroy, ioctl, netlink
   operations code.
 - registration for tunneling modules, like gre, ipip etc.
 - define single pcpu_tstats dev->tstats.
 - struct tnl_ptk_info added to pass parsed tunnel packet parameters.

ipip.h header is renamed to ip_tunnel.h
