usb: dwc3: workaround: unexpected transtion U3 -> RESUME

In DWC3 versions < 2.50a configured without
Hibernation mode enabled, there will be an
extra link status change interrupt if device
detects host-initiated U3 exit.

In that case, core will generate an unnecessary
U3 -> RESUME transition which should be ignored
by the driver.
