USB: ehci-omap: Use PHY APIs to get the PHY device and put it out of suspend

For each port that is in PHY mode we obtain a PHY device using the USB PHY
library and put it out of suspend.

It is up to platform code to associate the PHY to the controller's
port and it is up to the PHY driver to manage the PHY's resources.

Also remove weird spacing around declarations we come across.
