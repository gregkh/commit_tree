drivers: android: binder: Move the node release code to a separate function

The binder_deferred_release() function has many levels of indentation
which makes it difficult to read. This patch moves the code which deals
with disposing of a binder node to a separate binder_node_release()
function, thus removing one level of indentation and allowing the code to
fit in 80 columns.
