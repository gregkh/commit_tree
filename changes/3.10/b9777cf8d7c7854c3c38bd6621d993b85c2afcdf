cgroup: unexport locking interface and cgroup_attach_task()

Now that all external cgroup_lock() users are gone, we can finally
unexport the locking interface and prevent future abuse of
cgroup_mutex.

Make cgroup_[un]lock() and cgroup_lock_live_group() static.  Also,
cgroup_attach_task() doesn't have any user left and can't be used
without locking interface anyway.  Make it static too.
