ath6kl: fix usb related error handling and warnings

It was annoying to debug usb warm reboot initialisation problems as many usb
related functions just ignored errors and it wasn't obvious from the kernel
logs what was failing. Fix all that so that error messages are printed and
errors are handled properly.
