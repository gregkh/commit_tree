libceph: kill args in read_partial_message_bio()

There is only one caller for read_partial_message_bio(), and it
always passes &msg->bio_iter and &bio_seg as the second and third
arguments.  Furthermore, the message in question is always the
connection's in_msg, and we can get that inside the called function.

So drop those two parameters and use their derived equivalents.
