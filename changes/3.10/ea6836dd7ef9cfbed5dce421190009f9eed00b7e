bonding: fix set mode race conditions

Changing the mode without any locking can result in multiple races (e.g.
upping a bond, enslaving/releasing). Depending on which race is hit the
impact can vary from incosistent bond state to kernel crash.
Use RTNL to synchronize the mode setting with the dangerous races.
