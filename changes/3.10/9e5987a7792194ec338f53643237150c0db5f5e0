xfs: rearrange some code in xfs_bmap for better locality

xfs_bmap.c is a big file, and some of the related code is spread all
throughout the file requiring function prototypes for static
function and jumping all through the file to follow a single call
path. Rearrange the code so that:

	a) related functionality is grouped together; and
	b) functions are grouped in call dependency order

While the diffstat is large, there are no code changes in the patch;
it is just moving the functionality around and removing the function
prototypes at the top of the file. The resulting layout of the code
is as follows (top of file to bottom):

	- miscellaneous helper functions
	- extent tree block counting routines
	- debug/sanity checking code
	- bmap free list manipulation functions
	- inode fork format manipulation functions
	- internal/external extent tree seach functions
	- extent tree manipulation functions used during allocation
	- functions used during extent read/allocate/removal
	  operations (i.e. xfs_bmapi_write, xfs_bmapi_read,
	  xfs_bunmapi and xfs_getbmap)

This means that following logic paths through the bmapi code is much
simpler - most of the code relevant to a specific operation is now
clustered together rather than spread all over the file....
