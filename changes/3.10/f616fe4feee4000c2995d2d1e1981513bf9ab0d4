lguest: clear cached last cpu when guest_set_pgd() called.

commit v3.9-rc1-53-g6d0cda9 "lguest: cache last cpu we ran on." missed
one case, which causes a triple fault.  The guest calls guest_set_pgd()
on the top page, and we carefully remap the Switcher text page.  But
we didn't reset last_host_cpu, so map_switcher_in_guest() thinks
the guest's regs and IDT/GDT etc are already mapped.
