xen/smp/pvhvm: Don't point per_cpu(xen_vpcu, 33 and larger) to shared_info

As it will point to some data, but not event channel data (the
shared_info has an array limited to 32).

This means that for PVHVM guests with more than 32 VCPUs without
the usage of VCPUOP_register_info any interrupts to VCPUs
larger than 32 would have gone unnoticed during early bootup.

That is OK, as during early bootup, in smp_init we end up calling
the hotplug mechanism (xen_hvm_cpu_notify) which makes the
VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info call for all VCPUs and we can receive
interrupts on VCPUs 33 and further.

This is just a cleanup.
