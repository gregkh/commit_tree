virtio: console: replace EMFILE with EBUSY for already-open port

Returning EMFILE (process has too many open files) is incorrect to
indicate a port is already open by another process.  Use EBUSY for that.

This does change what we report to userspace, but I believe userspace
can look at it this way: it gets EBUSY, a new error code, instead of
EMFILE.  It's still an error, and that's not changing.
