libceph: combine initializing and setting osd data

This ends up being a rather large patch but what it's doing is
somewhat straightforward.

Basically, this is replacing two calls with one.  The first of the
two calls is initializing a struct ceph_osd_data with data (either a
page array, a page list, or a bio list); the second is setting an
osd request op so it associates that data with one of the op's
parameters.  In place of those two will be a single function that
initializes the op directly.

That means we sort of fan out a set of the needed functions:
    - extent ops with pages data
    - extent ops with pagelist data
    - extent ops with bio list data
and
    - class ops with page data for receiving a response

We also have define another one, but it's only used internally:
    - class ops with pagelist data for request parameters

Note that we *still* haven't gotten rid of the osd request's
r_data_in and r_data_out fields.  All the osd ops refer to them for
their data.  For now, these data fields are pointers assigned to the
appropriate r_data_* field when these new functions are called.
