[SCSI] ibmvfc: Support FAST_IO_FAIL in EH handlers

Adds support for receiving FAST_IO_FAIL from fc_block_scsi_eh
when in error recovery. This fixes cases of devices being
taken offline when they are no longer accessible on the fabric,
preventing them from coming back online when the fabric recovers.
