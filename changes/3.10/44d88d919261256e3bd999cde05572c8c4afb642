mei: bus: Synchronous API for the data transmission

Define a truly synchronous API for the bus Tx path by putting all pending
request to the write list and wait for the interrupt tx handler to wake
us up.
The ___mei_cl_send() out path is also slightly reworked to make it look more
like main.c:mei_write().
