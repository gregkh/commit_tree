rcu: Distinguish "rcuo" kthreads by RCU flavor

Currently, the per-no-CBs-CPU kthreads are named "rcuo" followed by
the CPU number, for example, "rcuo".  This is problematic given that
there are either two or three RCU flavors, each of which gets a per-CPU
kthread with exactly the same name.  This commit therefore introduces
a one-letter abbreviation for each RCU flavor, namely 'b' for RCU-bh,
'p' for RCU-preempt, and 's' for RCU-sched.  This abbreviation is used
to distinguish the "rcuo" kthreads, for example, for CPU 0 we would have
"rcuob/0", "rcuop/0", and "rcuos/0".
