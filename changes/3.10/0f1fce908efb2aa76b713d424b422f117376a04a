clk: exynos4: Remove SoC-specific registers from save list

Current clock save list is shared for all Exynos4 SoCs, so it must
contain only registers present in all supported SoCs, because accessing
unavailable registers might have undefined effect.

This patch removes registers specific for particular SoCs from shared
save list, as they should be supported by separate SoC-specific lists.
