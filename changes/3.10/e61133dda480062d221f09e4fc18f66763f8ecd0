powerpc/pseries: Force 32 bit MSIs for devices that require it

The following patch implements a new PAPR change which allows
the OS to force the use of 32 bit MSIs, regardless of what
the PCI capabilities indicate. This is required for some
devices that advertise support for 64 bit MSIs but don't
actually support them.
