USB: option,zte_ev: move most ZTE CDMA devices to zte_ev

Per some ZTE Linux drivers I found for the AC2716, the following patch
moves most ZTE CDMA devices from option to zte_ev.  The blacklist stuff
that option does is not required with zte_ev, because it doesn't
implement any of the send_setup hooks which the blacklist suppressed.

I did not move the 2718 over because I could not find any ZTE Linux
drivers for that device, nor even any Windows drivers.
