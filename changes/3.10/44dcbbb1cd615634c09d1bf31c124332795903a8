ALSA: snd-usb: add support for bit-reversed byte formats

There is quite some confusion around the bit-ordering in DSD samples,
and no general agreement that defines whether hardware is supposed to
expect the oldest sample in the MSB or the LSB of a byte.

ALSA will hence set the rule that on the software API layer, bytes
always carry the oldest bit in the most significant bit of a byte, and
the driver has to translate that at runtime in order to match the
hardware layout.

This patch adds support for this by adding a boolean flag to the
audio format struct.
