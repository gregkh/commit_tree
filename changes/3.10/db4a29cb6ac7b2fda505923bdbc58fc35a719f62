KVM: s390: fix and enforce return code handling for irq injections

kvm_s390_inject_program_int() and friends may fail if no memory is available.
This must be reported to the calling functions, so that this gets passed
down to user space which should fix the situation.
Alternatively we end up with guest state corruption.

So fix this and enforce return value checking by adding a __must_check
annotation to all of these function prototypes.
