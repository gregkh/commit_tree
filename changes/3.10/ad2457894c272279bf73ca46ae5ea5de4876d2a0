mtd: devices: elm: check for device's presence before configuration

In case the driver is not probed - due to config mismatches or errors
in the DTS files - dev_get_drvdata() returns NULL, leading to an Ooops
during boot.

Make elm_config() return an error in such cases to propagate the error
up to the user, so it can fall back to software mode.
