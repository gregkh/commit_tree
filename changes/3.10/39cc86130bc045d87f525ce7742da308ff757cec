unix/dgram: fix peeking with an offset larger than data in queue

Currently, peeking on a unix datagram socket with an offset larger than len of
the data in the sk receive queue returns immediately with bogus data. That's
because *off is not reset between each skb_queue_walk().

This patch fixes this so that the behavior is the same as peeking with no
offset on an empty queue: the caller blocks.
