xfs: remote attribute lookups require the value length

When reading a remote attribute, to correctly calculate the length
of the data buffer for CRC enable filesystems, we need to know the
length of the attribute data. We get this information when we look
up the attribute, but we don't store it in the args structure along
with the other remote attr information we get from the lookup. Add
this information to the args structure so we can use it
appropriately.
