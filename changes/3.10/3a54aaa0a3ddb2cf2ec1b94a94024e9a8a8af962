perf/x86: Improve sysfs event mapping with event string

This patch extends Jiri's changes to make generic
events mapping visible via sysfs. The patch extends
the mechanism to non-generic events by allowing
the mappings to be hardcoded in strings.

This mechanism will be used by the PEBS-LL patch
later on.
