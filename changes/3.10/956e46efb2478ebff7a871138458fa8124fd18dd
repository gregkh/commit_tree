mm/slab: Fix crash during slab init

Commit 8a965b3baa89 ("mm, slab_common: Fix bootstrap creation of kmalloc
caches") introduced a regression that caused us to crash early during
boot.  The commit was introducing ordering of slab creation, making sure
two odd-sized slabs were created after specific powers of two sizes.

But, if any of the power of two slabs were created earlier during boot,
slabs at index 1 or 2 might not get created at all.  This patch makes
sure none of the slabs get skipped.

Tony Lindgren bisected this down to the offending commit, which really
helped because bisect kept bringing me to almost but not quite this one.
