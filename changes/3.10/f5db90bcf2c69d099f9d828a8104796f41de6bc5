libceph: kill last of ceph_msg_pos

The only remaining field in the ceph_msg_pos structure is
did_page_crc.  In the new cursor model of things that flag (or
something like it) belongs in the cursor.

Define a new field "need_crc" in the cursor (which applies to all
types of data) and initialize it to true whenever a cursor is
initialized.

In write_partial_message_data(), the data CRC still will be computed
as before, but it will check the cursor->need_crc field to determine
whether it's needed.  Any time the cursor is advanced to a new piece
of a data item, need_crc will be set, and this will cause the crc
for that entire piece to be accumulated into the data crc.

In write_partial_message_data() the intermediate crc value is now
held in a local variable so it doesn't have to be byte-swapped so
many times.  In read_partial_msg_data() we do something similar
(but mainly for consistency there).

With that, the ceph_msg_pos structure can go away,  and it no longer
needs to be passed as an argument to prepare_message_data().
