tunneling: Add generic Tunnel segmentation.

Adds generic tunneling offloading support for IPv4-UDP based
tunnels.
GSO type is added to request this offload for a skb.
netdev feature NETIF_F_UDP_TUNNEL is added for hardware offloaded
udp-tunnel support. Currently no device supports this feature,
software offload is used.

This can be used by tunneling protocols like VXLAN.
