drm: add new QXL driver. (v1.4)

QXL is a paravirtual graphics device used by the Spice virtual desktop
interface.

The drivers uses GEM and TTM to manage memory, the qxl hw fencing however
is quite different than normal TTM expects, we have to keep track of a number
of non-linear fence ids per bo that we need to have released by the hardware.

The releases are freed from a workqueue that wakes up and processes the
release ring.

releases are suballocated from a BO, there are 3 release categories, drawables,
surfaces and cursor cmds. The hw also has 3 rings for commands, cursor and release handling.

The hardware also have a surface id tracking mechnaism and the driver encapsulates it completely inside the kernel, userspace never sees the actual hw surface
ids.

This requires a newer version of the QXL userspace driver, so shouldn't be
enabled until that has been placed into your distro of choice.
