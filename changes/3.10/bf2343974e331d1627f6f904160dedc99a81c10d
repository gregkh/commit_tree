ARM: OMAP2+: Remove unnecesssary GPMC definitions and variable

With commit 21cc2bd (ARM: OMAP2+: Remove apollon board support) the
variable "boot_rom_space" is now not needed and the code surrounding
this variable can be cleaned up and simplified. Remove unnecessary
definitions and clean-up the comment as well.
