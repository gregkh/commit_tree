btrfs: annotate quota tree for lockdep

Quota tree has been missing from lockdep annotations, though no warning
has been seen in the wild.

There's currently one entry that does not belong there,
BTRFS_ORPHAN_OBJECTID.  No such tree exists, it's probably a copy &
paste mistake, the id is defined among tree ids.
