staging: comedi: rti800: cleanup multi-line comments

Cleanup the multi-line comments at the beginning of the file to follow
the kernel CodingStyle.

Remove the comments before rt1800_attach(). They are a duplicate of
the "Configuration Options" in the Comedi comment block at the start
of the file.
