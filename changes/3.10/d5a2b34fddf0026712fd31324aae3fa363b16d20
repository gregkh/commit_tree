ARM: dts: Configure and fix the McSPI pins for 4430sdp

The bootloader configures the pins, but has pull bits
set without pull enable bits. While this is harmless,
and won't do anything, it seems to cause confusion at
least for me every time looking at the pin configuration.
Fix it for DT based boot.
