mac80211/minstrel_ht: improve accuracy of throughput metric at high data rates

At high data rates the average frame transmission durations are small
enough for rounding errors to matter, sometimes causing minstrel to use
slightly lower transmit rates than necessary.
To fix this, change the unit of the duration value to nanoseconds
instead of microseconds, and reorder the multiplications/divisions when
calculating the throughput metric so that they don't overflow or
truncate prematurely.
At 2-stream HT40 this makes TCP throughput a bit more stable.
