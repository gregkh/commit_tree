[media] mt9v022 driver: send valid HORIZONTAL_BLANKING values to mt9v024 soc camera

This patch fixes the issue that appears when mt9v024 camera is used with the
mt9v022 soc camera driver. The minimum total row time is 690 columns
(horizontal width + horizontal blanking). The minimum horizontal
blanking is 61. Thus, when the window width is set below 627, horizontal blanking must
be increased. For the mt9v024 camera the values above are correct and
for the mt9v022 camera the correct values are in the existing kernel driver.
