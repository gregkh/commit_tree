[media] tlg2300: fix tuner and frequency handling of the radio device

This driver now passes the tuner and frequency tests of v4l2-compliance.
It's the usual bugs: frequency wasn't clamped to the valid frequency range,
incorrect tuner capabilities and tuner fields not filled in, missing test
for invalid tuner index, no initial frequency and incorrect error handling.
