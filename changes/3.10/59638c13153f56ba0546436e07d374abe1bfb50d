ARM: regulator: add tps6507x device tree data

Add device tree data for tps6507x regulator by adding
all tps6507x regulator nodes. Regulators are initialized
based on compatible name provided in tps6507x DT file.

All tps6507x PMIC regulator device tree nodes are placed
in a separate device tree include file (tps6507x.dtsi).
tps6507x.dtsi file is created using datasheet
http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65070.pdf

Tested on da850-evm.
