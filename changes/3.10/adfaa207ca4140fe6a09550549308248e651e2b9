staging: comedi: das16: use comedi_legacy_detach()

Use the new comedi_legacy_detach() helper in the (*detach) to release
the first I/O region requested by this driver.

An additional I/O region is requested for some of the boards this driver
supports. Save the iobase for that region in the private data so that
the (*detach) knows it needs to be released.
