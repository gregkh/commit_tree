tracing: Add function-trace option to disable function tracing of latency tracers

Currently, the only way to stop the latency tracers from doing function
tracing is to fully disable the function tracer from the proc file
system:

  echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled

This is a big hammer approach as it disables function tracing for
all users. This includes kprobes, perf, stack tracer, etc.

Instead, create a function-trace option that the latency tracers can
check to determine if it should enable function tracing or not.
This option can be set or cleared even while the tracer is active
and the tracers will disable or enable function tracing depending
on how the option was set.

Instead of using the proc file, disable latency function tracing with

  echo 0 > /debug/tracing/options/function-trace
