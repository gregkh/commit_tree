drivers: net: cpsw: irq not disabled in cpsw isr in particular sequence

In CPSW NAPI, after processing all interrupts IRQ is enabled and then book
keeping irq_enabled is updated. In random cases when a packet is transmitted
or received between processing packets and IRQ enabled, then just after
enabled IRQ and before irq_enabled is updated, ISR is called so IRQs are
not disabled as irq_enabled is still false and CPU gets locked in CPSW ISR.

By changing the sequence as update the irq_enabled and then enable IRQ
fixes the issue. This issue is not captured always as it is a timing issue
whether Tx or Rx IRQ is invoked between packet processing and enable IRQ.
