PM / Runtime: Improve prepare handling at system suspend for genpd

When genpd prepares for a system suspend it will fetch a runtime
reference for the device. When returning it we now use the
asyncronous runtime PM API. Thus we don't have to wait for the
device to become idle|suspended before we move on and handle the
next device in queue.
