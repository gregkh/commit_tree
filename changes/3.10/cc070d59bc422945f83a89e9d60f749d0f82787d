rbd: get and check striping parameters

If an rbd format 2 image indicates it supports the STRIPINGV2
feature we need to find out its stripe unit and stripe count in
order to know whether we can use it.  We don't yet support fancy
striping fully, but if the default parameters are used the behavior
is indistinguishible from non-fancy striping.

This is necessary because some images require the STRIPINGV2 feature
even if they use the default parameters.  (Which is to say the feature
bit was erroneously set even if the feature was not used.)
