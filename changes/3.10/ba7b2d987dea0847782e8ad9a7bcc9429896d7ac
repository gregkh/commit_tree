OMAPDSS: panel acx565akm: remove omap_dss_device maximum backlight level usage

The omap_dss_device structs's max_backlight_level is used to pass maximum
backlight level for the platform. However, no board file using this panel
populates this field. Therefore, we remove it's usage from the panel driver.
