ARM: OMAP1: Replace PM debug create_proc_read_entry() with debugfs

There's no need to keep this entry in proc, it is PM
related debug only entry. Let's move it into debugfs.

Based on an earlier patch David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
to use seq_printf and to update to use create_proc_read_entry().
