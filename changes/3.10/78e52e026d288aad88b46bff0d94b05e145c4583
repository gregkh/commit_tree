ARM: OMAP2+: clock data: Remove CK_* flags

The patch removes all the CK_* which were used to identify the family of
processors for which the individual clocks belonged to. Instead now separate
lists are created based on the family of processors.

Boot Tested on: OMAP4430, OMAP4460, Beagle-board, AM33X boards, OMAP2 boards.
