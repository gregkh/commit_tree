HID: use hid_hw_wait() instead of direct call to usbhid

This removes most of the dependencies between hid drivers and usbhid.

The patch was constructed by replacing all occurences of
usbhid_wait_io() by its hid_hw_wait() counterpart.
Then, drivers not requiring USB_HID anymore have their USB_HID
dependency cleaned in the Kconfig file.

As of today, few drivers are still requiring an explicit USB layer
dependency:
* ntrig (a patch is on its way)
* multitouch (one patch following and another on its way)
* lenovo tpkbd
* roccat
* sony

The last three are two deeply using direct calls to the usb subsystem
to be able to be cleaned right now.
