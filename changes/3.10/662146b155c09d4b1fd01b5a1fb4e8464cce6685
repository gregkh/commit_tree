ARM: gemini: get platform to build again

There is no defconfig file for gemini, which has lead to a lot
of bitrot. This makes the broken board files, the gpio implementation
and the reset logic work again, and fixes the build warnings
that got introduced with the changes to the readl/writel prototypes.
