tracing: Fix bad parameter passed in branch selftest

The branch selftest calls trace_test_buffer(), but with the new code
it expects the first parameter to be a pointer to a struct trace_buffer.
All self tests were changed but the branch selftest was missed.

This caused either a crash or failed test when the branch selftest was
enabled.
