gpio: Renesas R-Car GPIO driver V3

This patch is V3 of a GPIO driver for the R-Car series of
SoCs from Renesas. This driver is designed to be reusable
between multiple SoCs that share the same basic building block,
but so far it has only been used on R-Car H1 (r8a7779).

Each driver instance handles 32 GPIOs with individually
maskable IRQs. The driver operates on a single I/O memory
range and the 32 GPIOs are hooked up a single interrupt.

In the case of R-Car H1 either external IRQ pins or GPIOs
with interrupts can be used for on-board interupts. For
external IRQs 4 pins are supported, and in the case of GPIO
there are 202 GPIOS as 202 interrupts hooked up via 6 driver
instances and to the GIC and the Cortex-A9 Quad.

At this point this driver is interfacing as a regular
platform device driver. In the future DT support will be
submitted as an incremental feature patch.
