ARM: 7763/1: kernel: fix __cpu_logical_map default initialization

The __cpu_logical_map array is statically initialized to 0, which is a valid
MPIDR value. To prevent issues with the current implementation, this patch
defines an MPIDR_INVALID value, and statically initializes the
__cpu_logical_map[] array to it. Entries in the arm_dt_init_cpu_maps()
tmp_map array used to stash DT reg properties while parsing DT are initialized
with the MPIDR_INVALID value as well for consistency.
