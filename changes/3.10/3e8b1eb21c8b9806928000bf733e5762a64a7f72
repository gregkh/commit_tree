mac80211/minstrel_ht: improve rate selection stability

Under load, otherwise stable rates can easily fluctuate because of
collisions. In my tests on a clean channel, the success probability of
the max throughput rate often stays somewhere between 90% and 100% under
load. This can cause some unnecessary switching to lower rates.
This patch improves stability by treating success probability values
between 90% and 100% the same.
In my tests on a 3x3 HT20 link with lots of TCP traffic, it improves the
average throughput by a few mbit/s.
