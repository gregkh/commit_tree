ALSA: hda - Avoid automatic pin-ctl update for hp/mic when jack ctl exists

When the headphone mic jack enum control is created (via explicitly
specification by user), it doesn't make much sense to change the I/O
direction dynamically per capture source change, since the I/O
direction is rather controlled over the enum ctl.

This also reduces the implicit dependency between the capture source
and the hp mic jack enum ctls, which might confuse a program accessing
the whole control elements at once like alsactl.

In addition, this patch introduces update_hp_automute_hook() function
to call the proper hook function.  It's just to remove the open codes
in multiple places in hda_generic.c.
