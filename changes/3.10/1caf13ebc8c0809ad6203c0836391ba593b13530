tg3: Add new FW_TSO flag

tg3 used the fw_needed member loosely as a synonym for firmware TSO. Now
that the 57766 needs firmware download support, fw_needed can no longer be
used like this. This patch creates a new FW_TSO flag and changes the
code to use it.

Also rearrange all the TSO flags together in the enum.
