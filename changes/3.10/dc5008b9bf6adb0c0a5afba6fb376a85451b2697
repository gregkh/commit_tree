s390/kvm: remove explicit -EFAULT return code checking on guest access

Let's change to the paradigm that every return code from guest memory
access functions that is not zero translates to -EFAULT and do not
explictly compare.
Explictly comparing the return value with -EFAULT has already shown to
be a bit fragile. In addition this is closer to the handling of
copy_to/from_user functions, which imho is in general a good idea.

Also shorten the return code handling in interrupt.c a bit.
