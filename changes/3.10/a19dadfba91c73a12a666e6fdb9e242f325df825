libceph: don't update op in calc_layout()

The ceph_osdc_new_request() an array of osd operations is built up
and filled in partially within that function and partially in the
called function calc_layout().  Move the latter part back out to
ceph_osdc_new_request() so it's all done in one place.  This makes
it unnecessary to pass the op pointer to calc_layout(), so get rid
of that parameter.
