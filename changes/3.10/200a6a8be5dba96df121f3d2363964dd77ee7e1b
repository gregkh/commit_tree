rbd: don't destroy rbd_dev in device release function

Rename rbd_dev_probe_finish() to be rbd_dev_device_setup().  Its
purpose is to set up the Linux side of an rbd device mapping.
Rename rbd_dev_release() to be rbd_dev_device_release(), making
it more obvious it serves as the inverse of the setup function
(or it will).

Encapsulate some of what was done in rbd_dev_release() into a new
function rbd_dev_image_release(), which serves as the inverse of
setting up the ceph side of the mapped rbd image.

Define a new helper rbd_dev_clear_mapping() to simply zero out the
fields of a mapping structure--the inverse of rbd_dev_set_mapping().
