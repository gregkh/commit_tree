x86/mm: Add missing comments for initial kernel direct mapping

Two sets of comments were lost during patch-series shuffling:

  - comments for init_range_memory_mapping()

  - comments in init_mem_mapping that is helpful for reminding people
    that the pagetable is setup top-down

The comments were written by Yinghai in his patch in:

   https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/11/28/620

This patch reintroduces them.
