ab8500-btemp: Filter btemp readings

Battery tempreature readings sometimes fail and results in
a value far from recent values. This patch adds a software
filter that disposes such readings, by allowing direct
updates on temperature only if two samples result in the
same temperature. Else only allow 1 degree change from previous
reported value in the direction of the new measurement.
