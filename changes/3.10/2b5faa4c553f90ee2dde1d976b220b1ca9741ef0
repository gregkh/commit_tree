connector: Added coredumping event to the process connector

Process connector can now also detect coredumping events.

Main aim of patch is get notified at start of coredumping, instead of
having to wait for it to finish and then being notified through EXIT
event.

Could be used for instance by process-managers that want to get
notified as soon as possible about process failures, and not
necessarily beeing notified after coredump, which could be in the
order of minutes depending on size of coredump, piping and so on.
