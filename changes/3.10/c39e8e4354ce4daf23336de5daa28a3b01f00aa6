i2c: xiic: must always write 16-bit words to TX_FIFO

The TX_FIFO register is 10 bits wide.  The lower 8 bits are the data to be
written, while the upper two bits are flags to indicate stop/start.

The driver apparently attempted to optimize write access, by only writing a
byte in those cases where the stop/start bits are zero.  However, we have
seen cases where the lower byte is duplicated onto the upper byte by the
hardware, which causes inadvertent stop/starts.

This patch changes the write access to the transmit FIFO to always be 16 bits
wide.
