cgroup: avoid accessing modular cgroup subsys structure without locking

subsys[i] is set to NULL in cgroup_unload_subsys() at modular unload,
and that's protected by cgroup_mutex, and then the memory *subsys[i]
resides will be freed.

So this is unsafe without any locking:

  if (!ss || ss->module)
  ...

v2:
- add a comment for enum cgroup_subsys_id
- simplify the comment in cgroup_exit()
