x86/mm: Re-enable DEBUG_TLBFLUSH for X86_32

CONFIG_INVLPG got removed in commit
094ab1db7cb7833cd4c820acd868fc26acf3f08e ("x86, 386 removal:
Remove CONFIG_INVLPG").

That commit left one instance of CONFIG_INVLPG untouched, effectively
disabling DEBUG_TLBFLUSH for X86_32. Since all currently supported
x86 CPUs should now be able to support that option, just drop the entire
sub-dependency.
