Btrfs: fix lockdep warning

The locking order for stuff is

__sb_start_write
ordered_mutex

but with sync() we don't do __sb_start_write for some strange reason, which
means that our iput in wait_ordered_extents could start a transaction which does
the __sb_start_write while we're holding the ordered_mutex.  Fix this by using
delayed iput in sync.  Thanks,
