ACPICA: FADT: Remove extraneous warning for very large GPE registers

This change removes a size mismatch warning if the legacy
length field for a GPE register set is larger than the 64-bit
GAS structure can accomodate. GPE register sets can be larger
than the 255 bit limitation of the GAS structure. Linn Crosetto
