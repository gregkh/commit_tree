staging: zcache: enable zcache to be built/loaded as a module

Allow zcache to be built/loaded as a module.  Note runtime dependency
disallows loading if cleancache/frontswap lazy initialization patches
are not present.  Zsmalloc support has not yet been merged into zcache
but, once merged, could now easily be selected via a module_param.

If built-in (not built as a module), the original mechanism of enabling
via a kernel boot parameter is retained, but this should be considered
deprecated.

Note that module unload is explicitly not yet supported.
