fuse: add flag fc->initialized

Existing flag fc->blocked is used to suspend request allocation both in case
of many background request submitted and period of time before init_reply
arrives from userspace. Next patch will skip blocking allocations of
synchronous request (disregarding fc->blocked). This is mostly OK, but
we still need to suspend allocations if init_reply is not arrived yet. The
patch introduces flag fc->initialized which will serve this purpose.
