batman-adv: Fix rcu_barrier() miss due to double call_rcu() in TT code

rcu_barrier() only waits for the currently scheduled rcu functions
to finish - it won't wait for any function scheduled via another
call_rcu() within an rcu scheduled function.

Unfortunately our batadv_tt_orig_list_entry_free_ref() does just that,
via a batadv_orig_node_free_ref() call, leading to our rcu_barrier()
call potentially missing such a batadv_orig_node_free_ref().

This patch fixes this issue by calling the batadv_orig_node_free_rcu()
directly from the rcu callback, removing the unnecessary, additional
call_rcu() layer here.
