ARM: AM33XX: Add missing .clkdm_name to clkdiv32k_ick clock

It is required to enable respective clock-domain before
enabling any clock/module inside that clock-domain.

During common-clock migration, .clkdm_name field got missed
for "clkdiv32k_ick" clock, which leaves "clk_24mhz_clkdm"
unused; so it will be disabled even if childs of this clock-domain
is enabled, which keeps child modules in idle mode.

This fixes the kernel crash observed on AM335xEVM-SK platform,
where clkdiv32_ick clock is being used as a gpio debounce clock
and since clkdiv32k_ick is in idle mode it leads to below crash -
