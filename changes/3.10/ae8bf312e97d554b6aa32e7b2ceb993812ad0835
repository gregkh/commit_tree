drbd: cleanup ondisk meta data layout calculations and defines

Add a comment about our meta data layout variants,
and rename a few defines (e.g. MD_RESERVED_SECT -> MD_128MB_SECT)
to make it clear that they are short hand for fixed constants,
and not arbitrarily to be redefined as one may see fit.

Properly pad struct meta_data_on_disk to 4kB,
and initialize to zero not only the first 512 Byte,
but all of it in drbd_md_sync().
