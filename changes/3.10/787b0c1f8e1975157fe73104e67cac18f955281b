serial: pl011: use generic DMA slave configuration if possible

With the new OF DMA binding, it is possible to completely avoid the
need for platform_data for configuring a DMA channel. In cases where the
platform has already been converted, calling dma_request_slave_channel
should get all the necessary information from the device tree.

This also adds a binding document specific to the pl011 controller,
and extends the generic primecell binding to mention "dmas" and other
common properties.

Like the patch that converts the dw_dma controller, this is completely
untested and is looking for someone to try it out.
