Revert "netprio_cgroup: make local table static"

This reverts commit 763eff57de893a27f8f18855f17033c92598c423.

It causes build regressions, as per Stephen Rothwell:

====================
After merging the final tree, today's linux-next build (powerpc
allyesconfig) failed like this:

net/core/netprio_cgroup.c:250:29: error: static declaration of 'net_prio_subsys' follows non-static declaration
include/linux/cgroup_subsys.h:71:1: note: previous declaration of 'net_prio_subsys' was here
====================
