libceph: separate read and write data

An osd request defines information about where data to be read
should be placed as well as where data to write comes from.
Currently these are represented by common fields.

Keep information about data for writing separate from data to be
read by splitting these into data_in and data_out fields.

This is the key patch in this whole series, in that it actually
identifies which osd requests generate outgoing data and which
generate incoming data.  It's less obvious (currently) that an osd
CALL op generates both outgoing and incoming data; that's the focus
of some upcoming work.

This resolves:
