sched: Keep at least 1 tick per second for active dynticks tasks

The scheduler doesn't yet fully support environments
with a single task running without a periodic tick.

In order to ensure we still maintain the duties of scheduler_tick(),
keep at least 1 tick per second.

This makes sure that we keep the progression of various scheduler
accounting and background maintainance even with a very low granularity.
Examples include cpu load, sched average, CFS entity vruntime,
avenrun and events such as load balancing, amongst other details
handled in sched_class::task_tick().

This limitation will be removed in the future once we get
these individual items to work in full dynticks CPUs.
