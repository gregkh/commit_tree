ACPI: Set length even for TYPE_END_TAG acpi resource

Found with a network device in QEMU/KVM guest not working anymore.

Bisected to commit c13085e5
    ACPICA: Resource Mgr: Prevent infinite loops in resource walks

That commit will check acpi_resource length strictly which causes
acpi_set_current_resources to return failure and IRQ for PCI
devices is not set properly.

Set length for all those TYPE_END_TAG acpi_resources.
