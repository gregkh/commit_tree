rbd: rearrange some code for consistency

This patch just trivially moves around some code for consistency.

In preparation for initializing osd request data fields in
ceph_osdc_build_request(), I wanted to verify that rbd did in fact
call that immediately before it called ceph_osdc_start_request().
It was true (although image requests are built in a group and then
started as a group).  But I made the changes here just to make
it more obvious, by making all of the calls follow a common
sequence:
	osd_req_op_<optype>_init();
	ceph_osd_data_<type>_init()
	osd_req_op_<optype>_<datafield>()
	rbd_osd_req_format()
	...
	ret = rbd_obj_request_submit()

I moved the initialization of the callback for image object requests
into rbd_img_request_fill_bio(), again, for consistency.  To avoid
a forward reference, I moved the definition of rbd_img_obj_callback()
up in the file.
