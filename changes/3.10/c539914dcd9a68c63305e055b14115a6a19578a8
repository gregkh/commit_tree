tile: support new Tilera hypervisor

The Tilera hypervisor shipped in releases up through MDE 4.1 launches
the client operating system (i.e. Linux) at privilege level 1 (PL1).
Starting with MDE 4.2, as part of the work to enable KVM, the
Tilera hypervisor launches Linux at PL2 instead.

This commit makes the KERNEL_PL option default to 2 for tilegx, while
still saying at 1 for tilepro, which doesn't have an updated hypervisor.
It also explains how and when you might want to choose another value.
In addition, we change a small buglet in the on-chip Ethernet driver,
where we were failing to use the KERNEL_PL constant in an API call.

To make the transition cleaner, this change also provides the updated
hv_init() API for the new hypervisor that supports announcing Linux's
compiled-in PL, so the hypervisor can generate a suitable error in the
case of a mismatched hypervisor and Linux binary.
