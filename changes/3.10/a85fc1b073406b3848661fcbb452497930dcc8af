ASoC: atmel-pcm-dma: No need to wrap snd_dmaengine_pcm_close()

If a PCM driver using the dmaengine PCM helper functions doesn't need to do
anything special in its pcm_close callback, snd_dmaengine_pcm_close can be used
directly for as the pcm_close callback and there is no need to wrap it in a
custom function.
