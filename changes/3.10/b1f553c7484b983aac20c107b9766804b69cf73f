iwlwifi: make device configuration bus agnostic

Newer devices can work on different buses. This means that
their configuration can be shared between different buses.
Hence the configuration structures should exported to all
the buses and not only to PCIE. Change this.

Note that this requires all the fields to be the same
amongst the buses. If differences will appear, we can always
define a part that is bus dependent. Today, this is not
needed.
