Input: auo-pixcir-ts - handle reset gpio directly

Devicetree based platforms don't handle device callbacks very well
and until now no board has come along that needs more extended hwinit
than pulling the rst gpio high.

Therefore pull the reset handling directly into the driver and remove
the callbacks from the driver.

If extended device setup is needed at some later point, power-sequences
would probably be the solution of choice.
