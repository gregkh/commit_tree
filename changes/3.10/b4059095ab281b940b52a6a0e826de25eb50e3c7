[media] siano: use the newer stats message for recent firmwares

The old statistics request don't work with newer firmwares.
Add a logic to use the newer stats if firmware major is 8.
Note that I have only 2 devices here, one with firmware 2.1
(Hauppauge model 55009 Rev B1F7) and another one with
firmware 8.1. We may need to adjust the firmware minimal
version for the *_EX message variants, as we start finding
firmware versions between 2.x and 8.x.
This patch was based on Doron Cohen patch:
