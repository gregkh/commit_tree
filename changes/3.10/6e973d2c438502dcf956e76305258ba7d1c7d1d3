clk: vexpress: Add separate SP810 driver

Factor out the SP810 clocking code into a separate driver,
selecting better (faster) parent at clk_prepare() time.
This is to avoid problems with clocking infrastructure
initialisation order, in particular to avoid dependency
of fixed clock being initialized before SP810. It also
makes vexpress platform OF-based clock initialisation code
unnecessary.
