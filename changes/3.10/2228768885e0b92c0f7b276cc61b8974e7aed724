ring-buffer: Select IRQ_WORK

As the wake up logic for waiters on the buffer has been moved
from the tracing code to the ring buffer, it requires also adding
IRQ_WORK as the wake up code is performed via irq_work.

This fixes compile breakage when a user of the ring buffer is selected
but tracing and irq_work are not.
