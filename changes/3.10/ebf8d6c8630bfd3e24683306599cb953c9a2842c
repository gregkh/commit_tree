drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c: fix accidentally enabling rtc channel

During resume, we call hpet_rtc_timer_init after masking an irq bit in
hpet.  This will cause the call to hpet_disable_rtc_channel to be undone
if RTC_AIE is the only bit not masked.

Allowing the cmos interrupt handler to run before resuming caused some
issues where the timer for the alarm was not removed.  This would cause
other, later timers to not be cleared, so utilities such as hwclock
would time out when waiting for the update interrupt.
