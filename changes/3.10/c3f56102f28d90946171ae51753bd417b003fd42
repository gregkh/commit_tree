libceph: validate timespec conversions

A ceph timespec contains 32-bit unsigned values for its seconds and
nanoseconds components.  For a standard timespec, both fields are
signed, and the seconds field is almost surely 64 bits.

Add some explicit casts so the fact that this conversion is taking
place is obvious.  Also trip a bug if we ever try to put out of
range (negative or too big) values into a ceph timespec.
