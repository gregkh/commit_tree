tick: Dynamically set broadcast irq affinity

When a cpu goes to a deep idle state where its local timer is
shutdown, it notifies the time frame work to use the broadcast timer
instead.  Unfortunately, the broadcast device could wake up any CPU,
including an idle one which is not concerned by the wake up at all. So
in the worst case an idle CPU will wake up to send an IPI to the CPU
whose timer expired.

Provide an opt-in feature CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_DYNIRQ which tells the core
that is should set the interrupt affinity of the broadcast interrupt
to the cpu which has the earliest expiry time. This avoids unnecessary
spurious wakeups and IPIs.
