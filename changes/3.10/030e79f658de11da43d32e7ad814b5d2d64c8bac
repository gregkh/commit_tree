ASoC: add snd_soc_register_component()

Current ASoC has register function for platform/codec/dai/card,
but doesn't have for cpu.
It often produces confusion and fault on ASoC.

As result of ASoC community discussion,
we consider new struct snd_soc_component for CPU/CODEC,
and will switch over to use it.

This patch adds very basic struct snd_soc_component,
and register function for it.
