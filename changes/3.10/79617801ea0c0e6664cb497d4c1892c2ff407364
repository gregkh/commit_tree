filter: bpf_jit_comp: refactor and unify BPF JIT image dump output

If bpf_jit_enable > 1, then we dump the emitted JIT compiled image
after creation. Currently, only SPARC and PowerPC has similar output
as in the reference implementation on x86_64. Make a small helper
function in order to reduce duplicated code and make the dump output
uniform across architectures x86_64, SPARC, PPC, ARM (e.g. on ARM
flen, pass and proglen are currently not shown, but would be
interesting to know as well), also for future BPF JIT implementations
on other archs.
