TTY: rocket, fix compilation warning

When CONFIG_PCI is unset, we see these warnings in rocket:
  drivers/tty/rocket.c:3140:13: warning: 'rmSpeakerReset' defined but not used
  drivers/tty/rocket.c:2599:12: warning: 'sPCIInitController' defined but not used

Fix those by moving the functions to one place and make them depend on
CONFIG_PCI.
