OMAPDSS: Fix crash with DT boot

When booting with DT, there's a crash when omapfb is probed. This is
caused by the fact that omapdss+DT is not yet supported, and thus
omapdss is not probed at all. On the other hand, omapfb is always
probed. When omapfb tries to use omapdss, there's a NULL pointer
dereference crash. The same error should most likely happen with omapdrm
and omap_vout also.

To fix this, add an "initialized" state to omapdss. When omapdss has
been probed, it's marked as initialized. omapfb, omapdrm and omap_vout
check this state when they are probed to see that omapdss is actually
there.
