Drivers: hv: Notify the host of permanent hot-add failures

If memory hot-add fails with the error -EEXIST, then this is a permanent
failure. Notify the host of this information, so the host will not attempt
hot-add again. If the failure were a transient failure, host will attempt
a hot-add after some delay.

In this version of the patch, I have added some additional comments
to clarify how the host treats different failure conditions.
