VFIO-AER: Vfio-pci driver changes for supporting AER

- New VFIO_SET_IRQ ioctl option to pass the eventfd that is signaled when
  an error occurs in the vfio_pci_device

- Register pci_error_handler for the vfio_pci driver

- When the device encounters an error, the error handler registered by
  the vfio_pci driver gets invoked by the AER infrastructure

- In the error handler, signal the eventfd registered for the device.

- This results in the qemu eventfd handler getting invoked and
  appropriate action taken for the guest.
