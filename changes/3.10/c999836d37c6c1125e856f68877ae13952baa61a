ASoC: dmaengine_pcm: Add support for compat platforms

Add support for platforms which don't use devicetree yet or have to optionally
support a non-devicetree way to request the DMA channel. The patch adds the
compat_request_channel and compat_filter_fn callbacks to the
snd_dmaengine_pcm_config struct. If the compat_request_channel is implemented it
will be used to request the DMA channel. If not dma_request_channel with
compat_filter_fn as the filter function will be used to request the channel.

The patch also exports the snd_dmaengine_pcm_request_chan() function, since
compat platforms will want to use it to request their DMA channel.
