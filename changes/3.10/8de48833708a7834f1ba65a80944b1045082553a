KVM: nVMX: Allocate shadow vmcs

Allocate a shadow vmcs used by the processor to shadow part of the fields
stored in the software defined VMCS12 (let L1 access fields without causing
exits). Note we keep a shadow vmcs only for the current vmcs12.  Once a vmcs12
becomes non-current, its shadow vmcs is released.
