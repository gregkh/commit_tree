drm/i915: correct the calculation of first_pd_entry_in_global_pt

When ppgtt is enabled, dev_priv->gtt.total has excluded the gtt space
occupied by ppgtt table in i915_gem_init_global_gtt() function. So the
calculation of first_pd_entry_in_global_pt doesn't need to subtract
I915_PPGTT_PD_ENTRIES again. Or else PPGTT directory table will be
destroyed by global gtt allocation.

This regression has been introduced in

    drm/i915: remove intel_gtt structure

The breakage is pretty subtile since the old gtt_total_entries
included the pde range, whereas the new on did not.
