ALSA: usb: Add quirk for 192KHz recording on E-Mu devices

When recording at 176.2KHz or 192Khz, the device adds a 32-bit length
header to the capture packets, which obviously needs to be ignored for
recording to work properly.

Userspace expected:  L0 L1 L2 R0 R1 R2
...but actually got: R2 L0 L1 L2 R0 R1

Also, the last byte of the length header being interpreted as L0 of
the first sample caused spikes every 0.5ms, resulting in a loud 16KHz
tone (about the highest 'B' on a piano) being present throughout
captures.

Tested at all sample rates on an E-Mu 0404USB, and tested for
regressions on a generic USB headset.
