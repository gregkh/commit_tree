KVM: emulator: emulate SALC

This is an almost-undocumented instruction available in 32-bit mode.
I say "almost" undocumented because AMD documents it in their opcode
maps just to say that it is unavailable in 64-bit mode (sections
"A.2.1 One-Byte Opcodes" and "B.3 Invalid and Reassigned Instructions
in 64-Bit Mode").

It is roughly equivalent to "sbb %al, %al" except it does not
set the flags.  Use fastop to emulate it, but do not use the opcode
directly because it would fail if the host is 64-bit!
