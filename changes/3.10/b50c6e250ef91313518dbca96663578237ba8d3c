Btrfs: deal with free space cache errors while replaying log

So everybody who got hit by my fsync bug will still continue to hit this
BUG_ON() in the free space cache, which is pretty heavy handed.  So I took a
file system that had this bug and fixed up all the BUG_ON()'s and leaks that
popped up when I tried to mount a broken file system like this.  With this patch
we just fail to mount instead of panicing.  Thanks,
