libceph: make ceph_msg->bio_seg be unsigned

The bio_seg field is used by the ceph messenger in iterating through
a bio.  It should never have a negative value, so make it an
unsigned.  (I contemplated making it unsigned short to match the
struct bio definition, but it offered no benefit.)

Change variables used to hold bio_seg values to all be unsigned as
well.  Change two variable names in init_bio_iter() to match the
convention used everywhere else.
