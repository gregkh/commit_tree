[media] siano: remove doubled new line

sms_debug() and sms_info() already adds a '\n' at the printed
strings. No need to add more.
That helps to cleanup stuff like:
	[ 4868.205648] smscore_onresponse: message not handled.
	[ 4868.205898] smscore_onresponse: message not handled.
and:
	[ 5467.959769] smscore_onresponse:
	data rate 143069 bytes/secs
While here, provides the message name, when the message is not
handled by the smsmdtv core.
