ipc: move the rcu_read_lock() from sem_lock_and_putref() into callers

This is another ipc semaphore locking cleanup, trying to make the
locking more straightforward.  We move the rcu read locking into the
callers of sem_lock_and_putref(), which in general means that we now
mostly do the rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock() in the same
function.

Mostly.  We still have the ipc_addid/newary/freeary mess, and things
like ipcctl_pre_down_nolock().
