ARM: smp: Drop RCU_NONIDLE usage in cpu_die()

Before f7b861b7a6d9 ("arm: Use generic idle loop") ARM would kill the
CPU within the rcu idle section.  Now that the rcu_idle_enter()/exit()
pair have been pushed lower down in the idle loop this is no longer true
and so using RCU_NONIDLE here is no longer necessary and also harmful
because RCU is not actually idle at this point.
