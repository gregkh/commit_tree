usbfs: Always allow ctrl requests with USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT on the ctrl ep

When usbfs receives a ctrl-request from userspace it calls check_ctrlrecip,
which for a request with USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT tries to map this to an interface
to see if this interface is claimed, except for ctrl-requests with a type of
USB_TYPE_VENDOR.

When trying to use this device: http://www.akaipro.com/eiepro
redirected to a Windows vm running on qemu on top of Linux.

The windows driver makes a ctrl-req with USB_TYPE_CLASS and
USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT with index 0, and the mapping of the endpoint (0) to
the interface fails since ep 0 is the ctrl endpoint and thus never is
part of an interface.

This patch fixes this ctrl-req failing by skipping the checkintf call for
USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT ctrl-reqs on the ctrl endpoint.
