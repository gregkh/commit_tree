bridge: fix switched interval for MLD Query types

General Queries (the one with the Multicast Address field
set to zero / '::') are supposed to have a Maximum Response Delay
of [Query Response Interval], while for Multicast-Address-Specific
Queries it is [Last Listener Query Interval] - not the other way
round. (see RFC2710, section 7.3+7.8)
