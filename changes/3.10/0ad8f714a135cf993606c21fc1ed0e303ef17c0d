s390/cio: fix early init counter usage

Via ccw_device_init_count we keep track of how many devices are in
asynchronous device recognition/initialization. For early devices this
variable was not only used prior to its initialization but used
incorrectly (incremented but never decremented). Fix this by using static
initialization for this variable (and friends), make them visible to
device.c only, and decrement the counter after recognition of early
devices is finished.
