Revert "perf sched: Handle PERF_RECORD_EXIT events"

This reverts commit 0439539f72ea222fbfe511b47318b9c1815a7108.

This caused this segfault:

[root@sandy linux]# perf sched rec
^C[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 1.306 MB perf.data (~57062 samples) ]
perf
[root@sandy linux]# perf sched lat
perf: builtin-sched.c:781: thread_atoms_search: Assertion `!(thread != atoms->thread)' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
[root@sandy linux]#

Further investigation is needed to check that even with machine__remove_thread()
not really deleting the thread referenced in the PERF_RECORD_EXIT (it goes to
machine->dead_threads, because references may still exist to them in things like
 hist, etc) some event later comes for this dead thread and then
machine__findnew_thread() will create a new thead instance that will not be the
same as the one referenced by work_atoms->thread in thread_atoms_search().

For now just revert this patch to get the 'perf sched lat' back working.
