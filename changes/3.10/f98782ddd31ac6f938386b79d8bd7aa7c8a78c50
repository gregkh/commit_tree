mm, vmalloc: iterate vmap_area_list in get_vmalloc_info()

This patch is a preparatory step for removing vmlist entirely.  For
above purpose, we change iterating a vmap_list codes to iterating a
vmap_area_list.  It is somewhat trivial change, but just one thing
should be noticed.

vmlist is lack of information about some areas in vmalloc address space.
For example, vm_map_ram() allocate area in vmalloc address space, but it
doesn't make a link with vmlist.  To provide full information about
vmalloc address space is better idea, so we don't use va->vm and use
vmap_area directly.  This makes get_vmalloc_info() more precise.
