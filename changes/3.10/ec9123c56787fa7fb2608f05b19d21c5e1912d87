libceph: set the data pointers when encoding ops

Still using the osd request r_data_in and r_data_out pointer, but
we're basically only referring to it via the data pointers in the
osd ops.  And we're transferring that information to the request
or reply message only when the op indicates it's needed, in
osd_req_encode_op().

To avoid a forward reference, ceph_osdc_msg_data_set() was moved up
in the file.

Don't bother calling ceph_osd_data_init(), in ceph_osd_alloc(),
because the ops array will already be zeroed anyway.
