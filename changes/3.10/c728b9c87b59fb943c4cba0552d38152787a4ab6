ipc: simplify semtimedop/semctl_main() common error path handling

With various straight RCU lock/unlock movements, one common exit path
pattern had become

	rcu_read_unlock();
	goto out_wakeup;

and in fact there were no cases where we wanted to exit to out_wakeup
_without_ releasing the RCU read lock.

So replace that pattern with "goto out_rcu_wakeup", and remove the old
out_wakeup.
