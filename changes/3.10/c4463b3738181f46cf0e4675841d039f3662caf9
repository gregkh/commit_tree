powerpc/powernv: Defer OPAL exception handler registration

Currently, the OPAL exception vectors are registered before the feature
fixups are processed. This means that the now-firmware-owned vectors
will likely be overwritten by the kernel.

This change moves the exception registration code to an early initcall,
rather than at machine_init time.
