staging: usbip: userspace: libsrc: cleanup parsing

Since the names.c/names.h are taken from another project, some
functions which names.c provides aren't used by usbipd.
This patch fixes:
 - removed useless comments
 - unified debug/error messages by using the macros
   provided by usbip_common.h
 - removed unnused code

The code cleanup includes:
 - remove unused data structures
 - remove code to create them
 - remove code to access them

The file names.c is used to parse the `usb.ids' file. The parser
stores a lot of information about usb devices that is never used.

The `usb.ids' file has several sections. Some variables (like
`lasthut') store the ID of the current section, and those variables
are used to decide which section is currently being parsed (i.e. in
which data structure the current line will be  stored).

We removed the code to read those IDs because they are never used
anyway. We replaced them by the pseudo-ID `1' (instead of reading the
ID from the file) to indicate that the parser is in a section that
can be ignored. If the parser is in such a section, the current line
(which contains sub-items for this section) is discarded.
