[media] soc_camera: error dev remove and v4l2 call

in soc_camera_close(), if ici->ops->remove() removes device firstly,
and then call __soc_camera_power_off(), it has logic error. Since
if remove device, it should disable subdev clk. but in __soc_camera_
power_off(), it will callback v4l2 s_power function which will
read/write subdev registers to control power by i2c. and then
i2c read/write will fail because of clk disable.
So suggest to re-sequence two functions call.
