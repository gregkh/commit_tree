Btrfs: explicitly use global_block_rsv for quota_tree

The quota_tree was set up to use the empty_block_rsv before
which would be problematic when the filesystem is filled up
and ENOSPC happens during internal operations while the quota
tree is updated and COWed (when the btrfs_qgroup_info_item
items) are written. In fact, use_block_rsv() which is used
in btrfs_cow_block() falls back to the global_block_rsv in
this case. But just in order to make it more clear what is
happening, change it to explicitly use the global_block_rsv.
