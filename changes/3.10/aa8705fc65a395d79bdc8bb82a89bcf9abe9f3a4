ath6kl: add tracing support to debug message macros

Now all log messages are sent through the tracing infrastruture as well.
Tracing point doesn't follow debug_mask module parameter, instead it sends
all debug messages, so once you enable ath6kl_log_dbg tracing point you will
get a lot of messages. Needs to be discussed if this is sensible or not.
The overhead should be small enough and we anyway include debug level as
well so it's easy to filter in user space.

I wasn't really sure what to do with ath6kl_dbg_dump() and for now decided
that it also sends the buffer to user space. But most likely in the future
ath6kl_dbg_dump() should go away in favor of using proper tracing points, but
we will see.
