tty: Remove unnecessary re-test of ldisc ref count

Since the tty->ldisc is prevented from being changed by tty_set_ldisc()
when a tty is being hung up, re-testing the ldisc user count is
unnecessary -- ie, it cannot be a different ldisc and the user count
cannot have increased (assuming the caller meets the precondition that
TTY_LDISC flag is cleared)

Removal of the 'early-out' locking optimization is necessary for
the subsequent patch 'tty: Fix ldisc halt sequence on hangup'.
