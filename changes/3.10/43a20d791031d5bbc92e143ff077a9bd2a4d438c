[media] em28xx: bump driver version to 0.2.0

The em28xx driver has changed much, especially since kernel 3.8.
So it's time to bump the driver version.
Changes since kernel 3.8:
- converted the driver to videobuf2
- converted the driver to the v4l2-ctrl framework
- added USB bulk transfer support
- use USB bulk transfers by default for webcams (allows streaming from multiple devices at the same time)
- added image quality bridge controls: contrast, brightness, saturation, blue balance, red balance, sharpness
- removed dependency from module ir-kbd-i2c
- cleaned up the frame data processing code
- removed some unused/obsolete code
- made remote controls of devices with external (i2c) receiver/decoder work again
- fixed audio over USB for device "Terratec Cinergy 250"
- several v4l2 compliance fixes and improvements (including fixes for ioctls enabling/disabling)
- lots of further bug fixes and code improvements
