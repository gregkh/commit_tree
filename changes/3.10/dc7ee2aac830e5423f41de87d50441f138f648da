coredump: change wait_for_dump_helpers() to use wait_event_interruptible()

wait_for_dump_helpers() calls wake_up/kill_fasync from inside the
wait_event-like loop.  This is not needed and in fact this is not
strictly correct, we can/should do this only once after we change
pipe->writers.  We could even check if it becomes zero.

Change this code to use use wait_event_interruptible(), this can also
help to make this wait freezable.

With this patch we check pipe->readers without pipe_lock(), this is
fine.  Once we see pipe->readers == 1 we know that the handler
decremented the counter, this is all we need.
