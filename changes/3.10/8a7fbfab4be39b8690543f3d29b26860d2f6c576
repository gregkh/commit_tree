netxen: write IP address to firmware when using bonding

This patch allows LRO aggregation on bonded devices that contain an
NX3031 device. It also adds a for_each_netdev_in_bond_rcu(bond, slave)
macro which executes for each slave that has bond as master.

V3: After testing and discussing this with Rajesh, I decided to keep the
    vlan ip cache and just rename it to ip_cache since it will store bond
    ip addresses too. A new master flag has been added to the ip cache to
    denote that the address has been added because of a master device.
    I've taken care of the enslave/release cases by checking for various
    combinations of events and flags (e.g. netxen has a master, it's a
    bond master and it's not marked as a slave means it is being enslaved
    and is dev_open()ed in bond_enslave).
    I've changed netxen_free_ip_list() to have a "master" parameter which
    causes all IP addresses marked as master to be deleted (used when a
    netxen is being released). I've made the patch use the new upper
    device API as well. The following cases were tested:
    - bond -> netxen
    - vlan -> netxen
    - vlan -> bond -> netxen

V2: Remove local ip caching, retrieve addresses dynamically and
    restore them if necessary.

Note: Tested with NX3031 adapter.
