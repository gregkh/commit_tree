kconfig menu: move Virtualization drivers near other virtualization options

Make virtualization drivers be logically grouped together (physically
near each other) in the kconfig menu by moving "Virtualization drivers"
to be near "Virtio drivers", Microsort Hyper-V, and Xen driver support.

This is just a user-friendly, visual search change.
