rbd: get rid of some version parameters

Several functions in rbd have parameters meant to allow the version
of an object to be passed in or out.  The purpose of those was to
allow the version of a header object to be maintained, but we no
longer do that.  As a result, these parameters are never actually
needed or used, so get rid of them.
