OMAPDSS: lb035q02: handle gpios in panel driver

The lgphilips panel driver leaves gpio configurations to the platform_enable
and disable calls in the platform's board file. These should happen in the
panel driver itself.

Use the platform data as defined for generic dpi panels to pass gpio information
to the lgphilips driver.

This will help in removing the need for the panel drivers to have platform
related callbacks.
