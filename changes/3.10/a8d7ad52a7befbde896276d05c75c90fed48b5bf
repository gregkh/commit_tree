sched/tracing: Allow tracing the preemption decision on wakeup

Thomas noted that we do the wakeup preemption check after the
wakeup trace point, this means the tracepoint cannot test/report
this decision; which is rather important for latency sensitive
workloads. Therefore move the tracepoint after doing the
preemption check.
