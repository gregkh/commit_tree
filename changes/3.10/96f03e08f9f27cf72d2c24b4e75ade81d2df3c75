rbd: don't bother checking whether order changes

When a format 2 image is refreshed, code is in place to verify that
the object order never changes from what it was originally.  This
relies on the fact that the refresh will occur *after* an initial
load of information about the image.

An upcoming patch makes it possible for the refresh to occur first,
so we can no longer make this order check.  The order really can't
ever change anyway--this was just a sanity check.  So get rid of it.
