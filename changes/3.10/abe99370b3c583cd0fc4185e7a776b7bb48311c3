ASoC: omap: Call omap_mcbsp_set_threshold() from mcbsp hw_params

The omap PCM driver provides a set_threshold callback which gets called by the
PCM driver when either playback or capture is started. The only DAI driver which
sets this callback is the mcbsp driver. This patch removes the callback from the
PCM driver and moves the invocation of the omap_mcbsp_set_threshold() function
to the mcbsp hw_params callback since this is the only place where the threshold
size can change. Doing so allows us to use the default dmaengine PCM trigger
callback in the omap PCM driver.
