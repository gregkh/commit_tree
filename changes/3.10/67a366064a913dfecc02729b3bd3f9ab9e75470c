net: cdc_ncm: demote "unexpected notification" to debug level

Receiving unhandled notifications is most certainly not an error
and should not be logged as one.  Knowing that the device sends
notifications we don't handle is useful for developers, but there
is very little a user can do about this.  The message is therefore
just annoying noise to most users with devices sending unhandled
notifications like e.g. USB_CDC_NOTIFY_RESPONSE_AVAILABLE
