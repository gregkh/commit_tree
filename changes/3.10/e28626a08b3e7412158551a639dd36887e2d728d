rbd: fix a bug in resizing a mapping

When a snapshot context update occurs, rbd_update_mapping_size() is
called to set the capacity of the disk to record the updated
size of the image in case it has changed.

There's a bug though.  The mapping size is in units of *bytes*.  The
code that updates the mapping size field is assigning a value that
has been scaled down to *sectors*.

Fix that.  Also, check to see if the size has actually changed, and
don't bother updating things (specifically, calling set_capacity())
if it has not.

This resolves:
