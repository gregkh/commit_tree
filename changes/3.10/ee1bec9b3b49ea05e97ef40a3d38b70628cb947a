netlink: kconfig: move mmap i/o into netlink kconfig

Currently, in menuconfig, Netlink's new mmaped IO is the very first
entry under the ``Networking support'' item and comes even before
``Networking options'':

  [ ]   Netlink: mmaped IO
  Networking options  --->
  ...

Lets move this into ``Networking options'' under netlink's Kconfig,
since this might be more appropriate. Introduced by commit ccdfcc398
(``netlink: mmaped netlink: ring setup'').
