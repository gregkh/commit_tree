drivers/video/backlight/lp855x_bl.c: fix compiler warning in lp855x_probe

While doing with make W=1 gcc (gcc (GCC) 4.7.2 20121109 (Red Hat
4.7.2-8)) I found

  drivers/video/backlight/lp855x_bl.c: In function `lp855x_probe':
  drivers/video/backlight/lp855x_bl.c:342:35: warning: variable `mode' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

fixed by removing it as since its not used anywhere
