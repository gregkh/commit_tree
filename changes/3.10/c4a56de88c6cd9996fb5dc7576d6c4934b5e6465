ixgbe: add mac type to the version in ethtool_regs

This patch adds the mac type to the version in ethtool_regs.

This will make it easier to check the mac type when dumping registers with
ethtool. The drawback of this is that older versions of ethtool will only
be able to dump in hex format for 82599 and above  when used with the updated
driver.
