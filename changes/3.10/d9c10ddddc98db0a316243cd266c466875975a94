memcg: fix memcg_cache_name() to use cgroup_name()

As cgroup supports rename, it's unsafe to dereference dentry->d_name
without proper vfs locks. Fix this by using cgroup_name() rather than
dentry directly.

Also open code memcg_cache_name because it is called only from
kmem_cache_dup which frees the returned name right after
kmem_cache_create_memcg makes a copy of it. Such a short-lived
allocation doesn't make too much sense. So replace it by a static
buffer as kmem_cache_dup is called with memcg_cache_mutex.
