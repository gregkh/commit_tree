be2net: Fix crash on 2nd invocation of PCI AER/EEH error_detected hook

During a PCI EEH/AER error recovery flow, if the device did not successfully
restart, the error_detected() hook may be called a second time with a
"perm_failure" state. This patch skips over driver cleanup for the second
invocation of the callback.

Also, Lancer error recovery code is fixed-up to handle these changes.
