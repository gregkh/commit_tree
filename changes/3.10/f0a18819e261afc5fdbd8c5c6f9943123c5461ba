parisc: fix SMP races when updating PTE and TLB entries in entry.S

Currently, race conditions exist in the handling of TLB interruptions in
entry.S.  In particular, dirty bit updates can be lost if an accessed
interruption occurs just after the dirty bit interruption on a different
cpu.  Lost dirty bit updates result in user pages not being flushed and
general system instability.  This change adds lock and unlock macros to
synchronize all PTE and TLB updates done in entry.S.  As a result,
userspace stability is significantly improved.
