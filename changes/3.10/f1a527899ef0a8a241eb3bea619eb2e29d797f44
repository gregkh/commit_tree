perf/x86: Fix broken PEBS-LL support on SNB-EP/IVB-EP

This patch fixes broken support of PEBS-LL on SNB-EP/IVB-EP.
For some reason, the LDLAT extra reg definition for snb_ep
showed up as duplicate in the snb table.

This patch moves the definition of LDLAT back into the
snb_ep table.

Thanks to Don Zickus for tracking this one down.
