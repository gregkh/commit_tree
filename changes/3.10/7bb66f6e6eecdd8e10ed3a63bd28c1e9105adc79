ARC: lazy dcache flush broke gdb in non-aliasing configs

gdbserver inserting a breakpoint ends up calling copy_user_page() for a
code page. The generic version of which (non-aliasing config) didn't set
the PG_arch_1 bit hence update_mmu_cache() didn't sync dcache/icache for
corresponding dynamic loader code page - causing garbade to be executed.

So now aliasing versions of copy_user_highpage()/clear_page() are made
default. There is no significant overhead since all of special alias
handling code is compiled out for non-aliasing build
