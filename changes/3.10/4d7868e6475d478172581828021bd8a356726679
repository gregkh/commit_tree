slub: Do not dereference NULL pointer in node_match

The variables accessed in slab_alloc are volatile and therefore
the page pointer passed to node_match can be NULL. The processing
of data in slab_alloc is tentative until either the cmpxhchg
succeeds or the __slab_alloc slowpath is invoked. Both are
able to perform the same allocation from the freelist.

Check for the NULL pointer in node_match.

A false positive will lead to a retry of the loop in __slab_alloc.
