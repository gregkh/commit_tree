[SCSI] bnx2fc: Fix race condition between IO completion and abort

When IO is successfully completed while an abort is pending, eh_abort
incorrectly assumes that abort failed and performes recovery by issuing
cleanup. Howerver, cleanup timesout as the firmware has no clue about
this IO. Fix this by checking if the IO has already completed.
