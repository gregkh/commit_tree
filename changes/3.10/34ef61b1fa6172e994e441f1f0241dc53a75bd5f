tracing: Add __per_cpu annotation to trace array percpu data pointer

With the conversion of the data array to per cpu, sparse now complains
about the use of per_cpu_ptr() on the variable. But The variable is
allocated with alloc_percpu() and is fine to use. But since the structure
that contains the data variable does not annotate it as such, sparse
gives out a lot of false warnings.
