ARM: OMAP2+: Add variable to store number of GPMC waitpins

The GPMC has wait-pin signals that can be assigned to a chip-select
to monitor the ready signal of an external device. Add a variable to
indicate the total number of wait-pins for a given device. This will
allow us to detect if the wait-pin being selected is valid or not.

When booting with device-tree read the number of wait-pins from the
device-tree blob. When device-tree is not used set the number of
wait-pins to 4 which is valid for OMAP2-5 devices. Newer devices
that have less wait-pins (such as AM335x) only support booting with
device-tree and so hard-coding the wait-pin number when not using
device-tree is fine.
