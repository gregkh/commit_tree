memcg: further simplify mem_cgroup_iter

mem_cgroup_iter basically does two things currently.  It takes care of
the house keeping (reference counting, raclaim cookie) and it iterates
through a hierarchy tree (by using cgroup generic tree walk).  The code
would be much more easier to follow if we move the iteration outside of
the function (to __mem_cgrou_iter_next) so the distinction is more
clear.  This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
