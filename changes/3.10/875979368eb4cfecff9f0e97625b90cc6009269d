firmware loader: fix use-after-free by double abort

fw_priv->buf is accessed in both request_firmware_load() and
writing to sysfs file of 'loading' context, but not protected
by 'fw_lock' entirely. The patch makes sure that access on
'fw_priv->buf' is protected by the lock.

So fixes the double abort problem reported by nirinA raseliarison:
