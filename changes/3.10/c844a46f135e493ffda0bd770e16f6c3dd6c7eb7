mmc: sdhci-pxav3: remove cd-broken quirk for permanently present card

Flag PXA_FLAG_CARD_PERMANENT is set in sdhci_pxa_platdata flags to
indicate that the card is always wired to host, like on-chip emmc,
which is permanently present and don't need detection.

So only MMC_CAP_NONREMOVABLE should be set for this case. But current
code also sets SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION, which doesn't make
sense.
