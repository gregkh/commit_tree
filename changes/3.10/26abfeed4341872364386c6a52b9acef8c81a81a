EISA: Initialize device before its resources

Move eisa_init_device() before eisa_request_resources() so the device
name is set before we set up its resources.  That way we can print
better messages.

Previously edev->res[i].name was set to NULL in eisa_request_resources(),
then filled in by eisa_init_device().  Now it is filled in by
eisa_init_device() first, and we don't want to clear it out later in
eisa_request_resources().
