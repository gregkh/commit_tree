ASoC: add .name for snd_soc_component_driver

This patch adds .name member on snd_soc_component_driver.
But this patch doesn't care about whether cmpnt_drv was NULL,
and/or its name was NULL in snd_soc_register_component()
at this point.

Because, it is easy to switch over to
snd_soc_register_component() from snd_soc_register_dais()
if it doesn't care cmpnt_drv was NULL.
