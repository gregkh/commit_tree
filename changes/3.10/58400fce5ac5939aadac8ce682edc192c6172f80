Btrfs: remove some unnecessary spin_lock usages

We use mutex lock to protect all the user change operations.
So when we are calling find_qgroup_rb() to check whether qgroup
exists, we don't have to hold spin_lock.

Besides, when enabling/disabling quota, it must be single thread
when operations come here. spin lock must be firstly used to
clear quota_root when disabling quota, while enabling quota, spin
lock must be used to complete the last assign work.
