parisc: fix partly 16/64k PAGE_SIZE boot

This patch fixes partly PAGE_SIZEs of 16K or 64K by adjusting the
assembler PTE lookup code and the assembler TEMPALIAS code.  Furthermore
some data alignments for PAGE_SIZE have been limited to 4K (or less) to
not waste too much memory with greater page sizes. As a side note, the
palo loader can (currently) only handle up to 10 ELF segments which is
fixed with tighter aligning as well.

My testings indicated that the ldci command in the sba iommu coding
needed adjustment by the PAGE_SHIFT value and that the I/O PDIR Page
size was only set to 4K for my machine (C3000).

All this fixes partly the boot, but there are still quite some caching
problems left.  Examples are e.g. the symbios logic driver which is
failing:

sym0: <896> rev 0x7 at pci 0000:00:0f.0 irq 69
sym0: PA-RISC Firmware, ID 7, Fast-40, SE, parity checking
CACHE TEST FAILED: DMA error (dstat=0x81).sym0: CACHE INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED.

and the tulip network driver which doesn't seem to work correctly
either:

Sending BOOTP requests .net eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII#1
link partner capability of 05e1
..... timed out!

Beside those kernel fixes glibc will need fixes too to be able to handle
>4K page sizes.
