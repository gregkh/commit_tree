Btrfs: stop all workers before cleaning up roots

Dave reported a panic because the extent_root->commit_root was NULL in the
caching kthread.  That is because we just unset it in free_root_pointers, which
is not the correct thing to do, we have to either wait for the caching kthread
to complete or hold the extent_commit_sem lock so we know the thread has exited.
This patch makes the kthreads all stop first and then we do our cleanup.  This
should fix the race.  Thanks,
