f2fs: cover free_nid management with spin_lock

After build_free_nids() searches free nid candidates from nat pages and
current journal blocks, it checks all the candidates if they are allocated
so that the nat cache has its nid with an allocated block address.

In this procedure, previously we used
    list_for_each_entry_safe(fnid, next_fnid, &nm_i->free_nid_list, list).
But, this is not covered by free_nid_list_lock, resulting in null pointer bug.

This patch moves this checking routine inside add_free_nid() in order not to use
the spin_lock.
