tracing: Add helper function trace_create_new_event() to remove duplicate code

Both __trace_add_new_event() and __trace_early_add_new_event() do
basically the same thing, except that __trace_add_new_event() does
a little more.

Instead of having duplicate code between the two functions, add
a helper function trace_create_new_event() that both can use.
This will help against having bugs fixed in one function but not
the other.
