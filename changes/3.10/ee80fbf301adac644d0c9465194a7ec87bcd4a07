packet: account statistics only in tpacket_stats_u

Currently, packet_sock has a struct tpacket_stats stats member for
TPACKET_V1 and TPACKET_V2 statistic accounting, and with TPACKET_V3
``union tpacket_stats_u stats_u'' was introduced, where however only
statistics for TPACKET_V3 are held, and when copied to user space,
TPACKET_V3 does some hackery and access also tpacket_stats' stats,
although everything could have been done within the union itself.

Unify accounting within the tpacket_stats_u union so that we can
remove 8 bytes from packet_sock that are there unnecessary. Note that
even if we switch to TPACKET_V3 and would use non mmap(2)ed option,
this still works due to the union with same types + offsets, that are
exposed to the user space.
