mei: nfc: Initial nfc implementation

NFC ME device is exported through the MEI bus to be consumed by the
NFC subsystem.

NFC is represented by two mei clients: An info one and the actual
NFC one. In order to properly build the ME id we first need to retrieve
the firmware information from the info client and then disconnect from it.
