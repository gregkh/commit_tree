ath9k: add support for DFS master mode

These are the remaining knobs in ath9k to support DFS:
* mark AR9280 and AR9580 as DFS tested
* synchronize DFS regulatory domain to reg notifyer
* set required RX filter flags for radar detection
* process radar PHY errors at DFS detector
* notify DFS master on radar detection

DFS support requires CONFIG_ATH9K_DFS_CERTIFIED to be set.
