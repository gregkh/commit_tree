net/mlx4_en: Add HW timestamping (TS) support

The patch allows to enable/disable HW timestamping for incoming and/or
outgoing packets. It adds and initializes all structs and callbacks
needed by kernel TS API.
To enable/disable HW timestamping appropriate ioctl should be used.
Currently HWTSTAMP_FILTER_ALL/NONE and HWTSAMP_TX_ON/OFF only are
supported.
When enabling TS on receive flow - VLAN stripping will be disabled.
Also were made all relevant changes in RX/TX flows to consider TS request
and plant HW timestamps into relevant structures.
mlx4_ib was fixed to compile with new mlx4_cq_alloc() signature.
