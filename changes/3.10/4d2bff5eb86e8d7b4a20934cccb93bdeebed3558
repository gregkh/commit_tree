ipc: introduce obtaining a lockless ipc object

Through ipc_lock() and therefore ipc_lock_check() we currently return the
locked ipc object.  This is not necessary for all situations and can,
therefore, cause unnecessary ipc lock contention.

Introduce analogous ipc_obtain_object() and ipc_obtain_object_check()
functions that only lookup and return the ipc object.

Both these functions must be called within the RCU read critical section.
