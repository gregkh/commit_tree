usb: musb: make use_sg flag URB specific

Since highmem PIO URB handling was introduced in:

8e8a551 usb: musb: host: Handle highmem in PIO mode

when a URB is being handled it may happen that the static use_sg flag
was set by a previous URB with buffer in highmem.  This leads to error
in handling the present URB.

Fix this by making the use_sg flag URB specific.
