Change "select DMAR" to "select INTEL_IOMMU"

Commit d3f138106b ("iommu: Rename the DMAR and INTR_REMAP config
options") changed all references to DMAR in Kconfig files to INTEL_IOMMU
(and, likewise, changed the references to CONFIG_DMAR everywhere else
to CONFIG_INTEL_IOMMU). That commit missed one "select DMAR" statement
in ia64's Kconfig file. Change that one too.
