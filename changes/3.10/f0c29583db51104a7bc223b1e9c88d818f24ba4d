ACPI / fan: avoid null pointer deference error

Fix a null pointer deference by acpi_driver_data() if device is
null.  We should only set cdev and check this is OK after we are
sure device is not null.

Smatch analysis:

drivers/acpi/fan.c:179 acpi_fan_remove() warn: variable dereferenced
  before check 'device' (see line 177)
