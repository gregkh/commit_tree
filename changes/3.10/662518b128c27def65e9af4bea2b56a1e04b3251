rbd: update in-core header directly

Now that rbd_header_from_disk() only fills in one-time fields once,
we can extend it slightly so it releases the other fields before
replacing their values.  This way there's no need to pass a
temporary buffer and then copy all the results in.  Just use the rbd
device header structure in rbd_header_from_disk() so its values get
updated directly.

Note that this means we need to take the header semaphore at the
point we update things.  So pass the rbd_dev rather than the address
of its header as its first argument to rbd_header_from_disk(), and
have it return an error code.

As a result, rbd_dev_v1_header_read() does all the work,
rbd_read_header() becomes unnecessary, and rbd_dev_v1_refresh()
becomes a very simple wrapper.
