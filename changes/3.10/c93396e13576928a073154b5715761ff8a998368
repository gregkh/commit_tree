[media] gspca: Remove gspca-specific debug magic

Instead use v4l2_dbg and v4l2_err. Note that the PDEBUG macro is kept to
make this patch-set less invasive, but it is simply a wrapper around
v4l2_dbg now. Most of the other changes are there to make the dev parameter
for the v4l2_xxx macros available everywhere we do logging.
