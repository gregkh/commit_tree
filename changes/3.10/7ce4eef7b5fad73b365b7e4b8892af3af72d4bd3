rbd: set mapping read-only flag in rbd_add()

The rbd_dev->mapping field for a parent image is not meaningful.
Since rbd_image_probe() is used both for images being mapped and
their parents, it doesn't make sense to set that flag in that
function.

So move the setting of the mapping.read_only flag out of
rbd_dev_image_probe() and into rbd_add() instead.
