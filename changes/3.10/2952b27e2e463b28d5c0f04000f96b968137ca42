ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Add support for multichannel playback

Davinci McASP has support for I2S multichannel playback.
For I2S playback/receive, each serializer is capable to play 2 channels
(L/R) audio data.Serializer function (Playback-receive-none) is configured
in DT, depending on hardware specification. It is possible to play less
channels than configured in DT. For that purpose,only specific number of
active serializers are enabled. McASP FIFO need to have DMA transfer Bcnt
set to number of enabled serializers, otherwise no data are transfered to
McASP and Alsa generates "DMA/IRQ playback write error (DMA or IRQ trouble?)"
error. For TDM mode, McASP is capable to play or receive 32 channels for one
serializer. McAsp has support for max 16 serializer, therefore max channels
is 32 * 8.
