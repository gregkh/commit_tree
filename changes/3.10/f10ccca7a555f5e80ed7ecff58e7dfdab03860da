s390/cio: ccw_device_force_console don't use static variable

force_console is used to wake up the CCW based console device to
print a panic message in case something goes wrong in a suspend
or resume cycle. Stop using the static console_subchannel and add
a parameter to this function to specify which ccw device we have
to wake up.
