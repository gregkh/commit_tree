x86, MCE, AMD: Use MCG_CAP MSR to find out number of banks on AMD

Currently number of error reporting register banks is hardcoded to
6 on AMD processors. This may break in virtualized scenarios when
a hypervisor prefers to report fewer banks than what the physical
HW provides.

Since number of supported banks is reported in MSR_IA32_MCG_CAP[7:0]
that's what we should use.
