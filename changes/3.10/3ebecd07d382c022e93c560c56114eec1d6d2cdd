drm/i915: Scale ring, rather than ia, frequency on Haswell

Haswell introduces a separate frequency domain for the ring (uncore). So
where we used to increase the CPU (IA) clock with GPU busyness, we now
need to scale the ring frequency directly instead. As the ring limits
our memory bandwidth, it is vital for performance that when the GPU is
busy, we increase the frequency of the ring to increase the available
memory bandwidth.

v2: Fix the algorithm to actually use the scaled gpu frequency for the ring.
v3: s/max_ring_freq/min_ring_freq/ as that is what it is
