tracing: Fix outputting formats of x86-tsc and counter when use trace_clock

Outputting formats of x86-tsc and counter should be a raw format, but after
applying the patch(2b6080f28c7cc3efc8625ab71495aae89aeb63a0), the format was
changed to nanosec. This is because the global variable trace_clock_id was used.
When we use multiple buffers, clock_id of each sub-buffer should be used. Then,
this patch uses tr->clock_id instead of the global variable trace_clock_id.

[ Basically, this fixes a regression where the multibuffer code changed the
  trace_clock file to update tr->clock_id but the traces still use the old
  global trace_clock_id variable, negating the file's effect. The global
  trace_clock_id variable is obsolete and removed. - SR ]
