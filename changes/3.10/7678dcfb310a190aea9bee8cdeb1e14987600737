s390/disassembler: prevent endless loop in print_fn_code()

If the size of the opcode to be printed is larger than "len" we'll
see an overflow of an unsigned long value, which means that the
while loop within print_fn_code() will loop quite a long time until
there is the next chance for an exit.
So add an early exit check.
