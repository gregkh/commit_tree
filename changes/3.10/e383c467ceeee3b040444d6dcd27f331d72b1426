ASoC: core: Drop unused "dapm" field form soc_enum struct

This field was added in commit 2e72f8e ("ASoC: New enum type: value_enum"), but
has never been used since. Considering that the soc_enum struct is usually
shared between all instances of a CODEC, it also doesn't make much sense to have
a pointer to DAPM specific data in it.
