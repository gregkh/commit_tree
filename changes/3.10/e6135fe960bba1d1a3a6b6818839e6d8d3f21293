ALSA: usb-audio: proc: use found syncmaxsize to determine feedback format

freqshift is only set for the data endpoint and syncmaxsize is only set
for the sync endpoint. This results in a syncmaxsize of zero used in the
proc output feedback format calculation, which gives a feedback format
incorrectly shown as 8.16 for UAC2 devices.

As neither the data nor the sync endpoint gives all the relevant
content, output the two combined.

Also remove the sync_endpoint "packet size" which is always zero
and the sync_endpoint "momentary freq" which is constant.

Tested with UAC2 async and UAC1 adaptive, not tested with UAC1 async.
