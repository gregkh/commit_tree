workqueue: consistently use int for @cpu variables

Workqueue is mixing unsigned int and int for @cpu variables.  There's
no point in using unsigned int for cpus - many of cpu related APIs
take int anyway.  Consistently use int for @cpu variables so that we
can use negative values to mark special ones.

This patch doesn't introduce any visible behavior changes.
