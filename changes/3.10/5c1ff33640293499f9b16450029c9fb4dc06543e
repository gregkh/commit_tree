ext4: fix free space estimate in ext4_nonda_switch()

Values stored in s_freeclusters_counter and s_dirtyclusters_counter
are both in cluster units.  Remove the cluster to block conversion
applied to s_freeclusters_counter causing an inflated estimate of
free space because s_dirtyclusters_counter is not similarly
converted.  Rename free_blocks and dirty_blocks to better reflect
the units these variables contain to avoid future confusion.  This
fix corrects ENOSPC failures for xfstests 127 and 231 on bigalloc
file systems.
