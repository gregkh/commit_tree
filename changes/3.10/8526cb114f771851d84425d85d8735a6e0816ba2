[SCSI] iscsi class, qla4xxx: fix sess/conn refcounting when find fns are used

This fixes a bug where the iscsi class/driver did not do a put_device
when a sess/conn device was found. This also simplifies the interface
by not having to pass in some arguments that were duplicated and did
not need to be exported.
