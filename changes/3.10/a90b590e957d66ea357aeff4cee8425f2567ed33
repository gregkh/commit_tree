drm/edid: Check both 60Hz and 59.94Hz when looking for a CEA mode

drm_match_cea_mode() should be able to match both the 60Hz version,
and the 59.94Hz version of modes.

We only store one pixel clock value per mode in edid_cea_modes, so the
other value must be calculated. Depending on the mode, edid_cea_modes
contains the pixel clock for either the 60Hz version or the 59.94Hz
version, so a bit of care is needed so that the calculation produces
the correct result.
