KVM: Fix race in apic->pending_events processing

apic->pending_events processing has a race that may cause INIT and
SIPI
processing to be reordered:

vpu0:                            vcpu1:
set INIT
                               test_and_clear_bit(KVM_APIC_INIT)
                                  process INIT
set INIT
set SIPI
                               test_and_clear_bit(KVM_APIC_SIPI)
                                  process SIPI

At the end INIT is left pending in pending_events. The following patch
fixes this by latching pending event before processing them.
