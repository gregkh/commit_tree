dm stripe: fix regression in stripe_width calculation

Fix a regression in the calculation of the stripe_width in the
dm stripe target which led to incorrect processing of device limits.

The stripe_width is the stripe device length divided by the number of
stripes.  The group of commits in the range f14fa69 ("dm stripe: fix
size test") to eb850de ("dm stripe: support for non power of 2
chunksize") interfered with each other (a merging error) and led to the
stripe_width being set incorrectly to the stripe device length divided by
chunk_size * stripe_count.

For example, a stripe device's table with: 0 33553920 striped 3 512 ...
should result in a stripe_width of 11184640 (33553920 / 3), but due to
the bug it was getting set to 21845 (33553920 / (512 * 3)).

The impact of this bug is that device topologies that previously worked
fine with the stripe target are no longer considered valid.  In
particular, there is a higher risk of seeing this issue if one of the
stripe devices has a 4K logical block size.  Resulting in an error
message like this:
"device-mapper: table: 253:4: len=21845 not aligned to h/w logical block size 4096 of dm-1"

The fix is to swap the order of the divisions and to use a temporary
variable for the second one, so that width retains the intended
value.
