powerpc/perf: Add new BHRB related generic functions, data and flags

This patch adds couple of generic functions to power_pmu structure
which would configure the BHRB and it's filters. It also adds
representation of the number of BHRB entries present on the PMU.
A new PMU flag PPMU_BHRB would indicate presence of BHRB feature.
