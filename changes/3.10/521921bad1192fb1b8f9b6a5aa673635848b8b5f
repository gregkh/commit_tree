kvm: Move guest entry/exit APIs to context_tracking

The kvm_host.h header file doesn't handle well
inclusion when archs don't support KVM.

This results in build crashes for such archs when they
want to implement context tracking because this subsystem
includes kvm_host.h in order to implement the
guest_enter/exit APIs but it doesn't handle KVM off case.

To fix this, move the guest_enter()/guest_exit()
declarations and generic implementation to the context
tracking headers. These generic APIs actually belong to
this subsystem, besides other domains boundary tracking
like user_enter() et al.

KVM now properly becomes a user of this library, not the
other buggy way around.
