USB: serial: wake up MSR-wait queue on disconnect

Make sure processes waiting for modem-status changes are woken up at
disconnect.

This is needed for custom subdriver TIOCMIWAIT-implementations which do
not yet handle hangup.

Even though processes on the tty-port wait queue are woken up at hangup
the wake-up call in usb-serial disconnect is still needed if a woken-up
process may go back to sleep (e.g. due to an incomplete
TIOCMIWAIT-implementation). If a disconnect occurs after a hangup, any
process waiting for changes will not be woken up a second time by the
tty-layer as the port will then have been disassociated from the tty.
