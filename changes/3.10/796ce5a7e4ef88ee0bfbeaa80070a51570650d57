staging/zsmalloc: don't use pgtable-mapping from modules

Building zsmalloc as a module does not work on ARM because it uses
an interface that is not exported:

ERROR: "flush_tlb_kernel_range" [drivers/staging/zsmalloc/zsmalloc.ko] undefined!

Since this is only used as a performance optimization and only on ARM,
we can avoid the problem simply by not using that optimization when
building zsmalloc it is a loadable module.

flush_tlb_kernel_range is often an inline function, but out of the
architectures that use an extern function, only powerpc exports
it.
