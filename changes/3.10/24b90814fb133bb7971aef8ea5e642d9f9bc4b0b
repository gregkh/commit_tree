USB: EHCI: don't turn on PORT_SUSPEND during port resume

This patch (as1637) cleans up the way ehci-hcd handles end-of-resume
port signalling.  When the PORT_RESUME bit in the port's status and
control register is cleared, we shouldn't be setting the PORT_SUSPEND
bit at the same time.  Not doing this doesn't seem to have hurt so
far, but we might as well do the right thing.

Also, the patch replaces an estimated value for what the port status
should be following a resume with the actual register value.
