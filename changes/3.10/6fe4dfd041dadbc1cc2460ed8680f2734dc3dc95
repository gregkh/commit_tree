clocksource: samsung_pwm_timer: Correct programming of clock events

In current code, the tick count value programmed to the hardware is
always decremented by one. This is reasonable for periodic mode, since
there is one extra tick between 0 and COUNT (after reloading), but it
makes oneshot events happen 1 tick earlier than requested, because the
interrupt is triggered on transition from 1 to 0.

This patch removes the decrementation from PWM channel setup code and
moves it instead to periodic timer setup, to make both periodic and
oneshot modes work correctly.
