ARM: default machine descriptor for multiplatform

Since we now have default implementations for init_time and init_irq,
the init_machine callback is the only one that is not yet optional,
but since simple DT based platforms all have the same
of_platform_populate function call in there, we can consolidate them
as well, and then actually boot with a completely empty machine_desc.
Unofortunately we cannot just default to an empty init_machine: We
cannot call of_platform_populate before init_machine because that
does not work in case of auxdata, and we cannot call it after
init_machine either because the machine might need to run code
after adding the devices.

To take the final step, this adds support for booting without defining
any machine_desc whatsoever.

For the case that CONFIG_MULTIPLATFORM is enabled, it adds a
global machine descriptor that never matches any machine but is
used as a fallback if nothing else matches. We assume that without
CONFIG_MULTIPLATFORM, we only want to boot on the systems that the kernel
is built for, so we still retain the build-time warning for missing
machine descriptors and the run-time warning when the platform does not
match in that case.

In the case that we run on a multiplatform kernel and the machine
provides a fully populated device tree, we attempt to keep booting,
hoping that no machine specific callbacks are necessary.

Finally, this also removes the misguided "select ARCH_VEXPRESS" that
was only added to avoid a build error for allnoconfig kernels.
