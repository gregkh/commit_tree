DM RAID: Add message/status support for changing sync action

DM RAID:  Add message/status support for changing sync action

This patch adds a message interface to dm-raid to allow the user to more
finely control the sync actions being performed by the MD driver.  This
gives the user the ability to initiate "check" and "repair" (i.e. scrubbing).
Two additional fields have been appended to the status output to provide more
information about the type of sync action occurring and the results of those
actions, specifically: <sync_action> and <mismatch_cnt>.  These new fields
will always be populated.  This is essentially the device-mapper way of doing
what MD controls through the 'sync_action' sysfs file and shows through the
'mismatch_cnt' sysfs file.
