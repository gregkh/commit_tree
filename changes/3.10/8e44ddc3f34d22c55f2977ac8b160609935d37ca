powerpc/kvm/book3s: Add support for H_IPOLL and H_XIRR_X in XICS emulation

This adds the remaining two hypercalls defined by PAPR for manipulating
the XICS interrupt controller, H_IPOLL and H_XIRR_X.  H_IPOLL returns
information about the priority and pending interrupts for a virtual
cpu, without changing any state.  H_XIRR_X is like H_XIRR in that it
reads and acknowledges the highest-priority pending interrupt, but it
also returns the timestamp (timebase register value) from when the
interrupt was first received by the hypervisor.  Currently we just
return the current time, since we don't do any software queueing of
virtual interrupts inside the XICS emulation code.

These hcalls are not currently used by Linux guests, but may be in
future.
