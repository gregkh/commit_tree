powerpc/eeh: Add eeh_dev to the cache during boot

commit f8f7d63fd96ead101415a1302035137a866f8998 ("powerpc/eeh: Trace eeh
device from I/O cache") broke EEH on pseries for devices that were
present during boot and have not been hotplugged/DLPARed.

eeh_check_failure will get the eeh_dev from the cache, and will get
NULL. eeh_addr_cache_build adds the addresses to the cache, but eeh_dev
for the giving pci_device is not set yet. Just reordering the call to
eeh_addr_cache_insert_dev works fine. The ordering is similar to the one
in eeh_add_device_late.
