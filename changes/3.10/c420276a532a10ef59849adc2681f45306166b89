ceph: add cpu_to_le32() calls when encoding a reconnect capability

In his review, Alex Elder mentioned that he hadn't checked that
num_fcntl_locks and num_flock_locks were properly decoded on the
server side, from a le32 over-the-wire type to a cpu type.
I checked, and AFAICS it is done; those interested can consult
    Locker::_do_cap_update()
in src/mds/Locker.cc and src/include/encoding.h in the Ceph server
code (git://github.com/ceph/ceph).

I also checked the server side for flock_len decoding, and I believe
that also happens correctly, by virtue of having been declared
__le32 in struct ceph_mds_cap_reconnect, in src/include/ceph_fs.h.
