powerpc: Fix build failure after merge of the cgroup tree

After merging the cgroup tree, today's linux-next build (powerpc
ppc64_defconfig) failed like this:

arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c: In function 'arch_update_cpu_topology':
arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c:1465:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'kzalloc' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c:1465:10: error: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast [-Werror]
arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c:1497:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'kfree' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

Caused by commit 30c05350c39d ("powerpc/pseries: Use stop machine to
update cpu maps") from the powerpc tree interacting with (probably)
commit ff794dea52ea ("cpuset: remove include of cgroup.h from cpuset.h")
from the cgroup tree.  Removing includes from header files is fraught
with danger ...

The former should have added an include of linux/slab.h to
arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c.

I have added the following merge fix patch for today (but it should be
applied to the powerpc tree ASAP).
