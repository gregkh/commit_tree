sysrq: fix inconstistent help message of sysrq key

Currently help message of /proc/sysrq-trigger highlight its
upper-case characters, like below:

      SysRq : HELP : loglevel(0-9) reBoot Crash terminate-all-tasks(E)
      memory-full-oom-kill(F) kill-all-tasks(I) ...

this would confuse user trigger sysrq by upper-case character, which is
inconsistent with the real lower-case character registed key.

This inconsistent help message will also lead more confused when
26 upper-case letters put into use in future.

This patch fix it.

Thanks the comments from Andrew and Randy.
