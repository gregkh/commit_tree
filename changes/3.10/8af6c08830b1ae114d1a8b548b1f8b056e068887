Revert "HID: Fix logitech-dj: missing Unifying device issue"

This reverts commit 596264082f10dd4a567c43d4526b2f54ac5520bc.

The reverted commit was a workaround needed when drivers became unable
to communicate with devices during probe(). Now that such
communication is possible, the workaround is not needed.
