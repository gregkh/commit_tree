s390/mem_detect: fix memory hole handling

With git commit 996b4a7d "s390/mem_detect: remove artificial kdump
memory types" the memory detection code got simplified.
As a side effect the array that describes memory chunks may now
contain empty (zeroed) entries.
All call sites can handle this except for

drivers/s390/char/zcore.c::zcore_memmap_open

which has a really odd user space interface. The easiest fix is to
change the memory hole handling code, so that no empty entries exist
before the last valid entry is reached.
