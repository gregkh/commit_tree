macvtap: set transport header before passing skb to lower device

Set the transport header for 1) some drivers (e.g ixgbe) needs l4 header 2)
precise packet length estimation (introduced in 1def9238) needs l4 header to
compute header length.

For the packets with partial checksum, the patch just set the transport header
to csum_start. Otherwise tries to use skb_flow_dissect() to get l4 offset, if it
fails, just pretend no l4 header.
