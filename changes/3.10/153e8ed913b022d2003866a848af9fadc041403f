tracing: Fix the branch tracer that broke with buffer change

The changce to add the trace_buffer struct to have the trace array
have both the main buffer and max buffer broke the branch tracer
because the change did not update that code. As the branch tracer
adds a significant amount of overhead, and must be selected via
a selection (not a allyesconfig) it was missed in testing.
