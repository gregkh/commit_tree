rbd: define parent image request routines

Define rbd_parent_request_create() and rbd_parent_request_destroy()
to handle the creation of parent image requests submitted for
layered image objects.  For simplicity, let rbd_img_request_put()
handle dropping the reference to any image request (parent or not),
and call whichever destructor is appropriate on the last put.
