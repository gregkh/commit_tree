kvm/ppc/booke64: Fix AltiVec interrupt numbers and build breakage

Interrupt numbers defined for Book3E follows IVORs definition. Align
BOOKE_INTERRUPT_ALTIVEC_UNAVAIL and BOOKE_INTERRUPT_ALTIVEC_ASSIST to this
rule which also fixes the build breakage.
IVORs 32 and 33 are shared so reflect this in the interrupts naming.

This fixes a build break for 64-bit booke KVM.
