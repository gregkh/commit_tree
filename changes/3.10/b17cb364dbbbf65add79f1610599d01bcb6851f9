xfs: fix missing KM_NOFS tags to keep lockdep happy

There are several places where we use KM_SLEEP allocation contexts
and use the fact that they are called from transaction context to
add KM_NOFS where appropriate. Unfortunately, there are several
places where the code makes this assumption but can be called from
outside transaction context but with filesystem locks held. These
places need explicit KM_NOFS annotations to avoid lockdep
complaining about reclaim contexts.
