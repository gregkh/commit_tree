MIPS: Extract schedule_mfi info from __schedule

schedule_mfi is supposed to be extracted from schedule(), and
is used in thread_saved_pc and get_wchan.

But, after optimization, schedule() is reduced to a sibling
call to __schedule(), and no real frame info can be extracted.

One solution is to compile schedule() with -fno-omit-frame-pointer
and -fno-optimize-sibling-calls, but that will incur performance
degradation.

Another solution is to extract info from the real scheduler,
__schedule, and this is the approache adopted here.

This patch reads the __schedule address by either following
the 'j' call in schedule if KALLSYMS is disabled or by using
kallsyms_lookup_name to lookup __schedule if KALLSYMS is
available, then, extracts schedule_mfi from __schedule frame info.

This patch also fixes the "Can't analyze schedule() prologue"
warning at boot time.
