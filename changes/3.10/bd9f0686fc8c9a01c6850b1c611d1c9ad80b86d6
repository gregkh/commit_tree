rcu: Repurpose no-CBs event tracing to future-GP events

Dyntick-idle CPUs need to be able to pre-announce their need for grace
periods.  This can be done using something similar to the mechanism used
by no-CB CPUs to announce their need for grace periods.  This commit
moves in this direction by renaming the no-CBs grace-period event tracing
to suit the new future-grace-period needs.
