openvswitch: Simplify datapath locking.

Currently OVS uses combination of genl and rtnl lock to protect
datapath state.  This was done due to networking stack locking.
But this has complicated locking and there are few lock ordering
issues with new tunneling protocols.
Following patch simplifies locking by introducing new ovs mutex
and now this lock is used to protect entire ovs state.
