workqueue: introduce put_pwq_unlocked()

Factor out lock pool, put_pwq(), unlock sequence into
put_pwq_unlocked().  The two existing places are converted and there
will be more with NUMA affinity support.

This is to prepare for NUMA affinity support for unbound workqueues
and doesn't introduce any functional difference.
