staging: comedi: amplc_dio200: split dio200_boards[] into ISA & PCI

Split `dio200_boards[]` into `dio200_isa_boards[]` for ISA cards and
`dio200_pci_boards[]` for PCI cards.  Only initialize the board-name
look-up members of `struct comedi_driver amplc_dio200_driver` if the ISA
part of the driver is enabled in the kernel config
(`CONFIG_COMEDI_AMPLC_DIO200_ISA`) using the array of ISA boards
(`dio200_isa_boards[]`).  The driver doesn't allow manual configuration
of PCI devices, so there is no point having the comedi core match the
names of the PCI boards before it calls our driver's legacy attach
routine (`dio200_attach()`).
