Revert "MIPS: Allow ASID size to be determined at boot time."

This reverts commit d532f3d26716a39dfd4b88d687bd344fbe77e390.

The original commit has several problems:

1) Doesn't work with 64-bit kernels.

2) Calls TLBMISS_HANDLER_SETUP() before the code is generated.

3) Calls TLBMISS_HANDLER_SETUP() twice in per_cpu_trap_init() when
   only one call is needed.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Also revert the bits of the ASID patch which were
hidden in the KVM merge.]
