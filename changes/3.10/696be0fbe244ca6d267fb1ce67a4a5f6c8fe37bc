ALSA: hdspm - Provide ALSA control to disable 96K frames

For 96kHz, MADI allows to multiplex the samples (SMUX) or to use a
dedicated 96K mode. The RME cards default to 96K mode, but since not all
external MADI equipment supports this, provide a switch to users that
changes the on-wire protocol to SMUX.
