DRM/i915: Remove i965_hpd_irq_setup.

After
"Convert HPD interrupts to make use of HPD pin assignment in encoders."
This function is now basically the same as i915_hpd_irq_setup().

Consolidating both functions in one requires one more check for
I915_HAS_HOTPLUG(dev) in the i965 code path and one more check for
IS_G4X(dev) in the i915 code path. These are considered harmless.
