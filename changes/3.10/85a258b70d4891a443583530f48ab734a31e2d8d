ocfs2: fix error handling in ocfs2_ioctl_move_extents()

Smatch complains that if we hit an error (for example if the file is
immutable) then "range" has uninitialized stack data and we copy it to
the user.

I've re-written the error handling to avoid this problem and make it a
little cleaner as well.
