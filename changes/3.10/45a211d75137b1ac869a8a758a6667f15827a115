drm/i915: no lvds quirk for hp t5740

Last year, a patch was made for the "HP t5740e Thin Client" (see
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2012-May/023245.html).
This device reports an lvds panel, but does not really have one.

The predecessor of this device is the "hp t5740", which also does not have
an lvds panel. This patch will add the same quirk for this device.
