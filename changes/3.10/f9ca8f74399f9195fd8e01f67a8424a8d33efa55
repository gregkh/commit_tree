netback: set transport header before passing it to kernel

Currently, for the packets receives from netback, before doing header check,
kernel just reset the transport header in netif_receive_skb() which pretends non
l4 header. This is suboptimal for precise packet length estimation (introduced
in 1def9238: net_sched: more precise pkt_len computation) which needs correct l4
header for gso packets.

The patch just reuse the header probed by netback for partial checksum packets
and tries to use skb_flow_dissect() for other cases, if both fail, just pretend
no l4 header.
