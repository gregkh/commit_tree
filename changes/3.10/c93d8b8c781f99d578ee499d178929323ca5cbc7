ARC: Allow embedded arc-intc to be properly placed in DT intc hierarchy

arc-intc is initialized in arc common code as it is applicable to all
platforms. However platforms with their own external intc still need to
refer to it for correct DT interrupt tree hierarchy setup,

e.g.
static struct of_device_id __initdata tb10x_irq_ids[] = {
	{ .compatible = "snps,arc700-intc", .data = dummy_init_irq },
	{ .compatible = "abilis,tb10x_ictl", .data = tb10x_init_irq },
	{},
};

The fix is to use the generic irqchip framework to tie all irqchips in
a special linker section and then call irqchip_init() which calls the
DT of_irq_init() for all the intc in one go.

That way the platform code need not be aware of arc-intc at all.
