cgroup: restore the call to eventfd->poll()

I mistakenly removed the call to eventfd->poll() while I was actually
intending to remove the return value...

Calling evenfd->poll() will hook cgroup_event_wake() to the poll
waitqueue, which will be called to unregister eventfd when rmdir a
cgroup or close eventfd.
