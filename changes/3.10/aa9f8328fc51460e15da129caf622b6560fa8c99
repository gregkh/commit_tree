[SCSI] sas: unify the pointlessly separated enums sas_dev_type and sas_device_type

These enums have been separate since the dawn of SAS, mainly because the
latter is a procotol only enum and the former includes additional state
for libsas.  The dichotomy causes endless confusion about which one you
should use where and leads to pointless warnings like this:

drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_sas.c: In function 'mvs_update_phyinfo':
drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_sas.c:1162:34: warning: comparison between 'enum sas_device_type' and 'enum sas_dev_type' [-Wenum-compare]

Fix by eliminating one of them.  The one kept is effectively the sas.h
one, but call it sas_device_type and make sure the enums are all
properly namespaced with the SAS_ prefix.
