vm: adjust ifdef for TINY_RCU

There is an ifdef in page_cache_get_speculative() that checks for !SMP
and TREE_RCU, which has been an impossible combination since the advent
of TINY_RCU.  The ifdef enables a fastpath that is valid when preemption
is disabled by rcu_read_lock() in UP systems, which is the case when
TINY_RCU is enabled.  This commit therefore adjusts the ifdef to
generate the fastpath when TINY_RCU is enabled.
