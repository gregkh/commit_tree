mmKconfig: add an option to disable bounce

There are times when HIGHMEM is enabled, but we don't prefer
CONFIG_BOUNCE to be enabled.  CONFIG_BOUNCE can reduce the block device
throughput, and this is not ideal for machines where we don't gain much
by enabling it.  So provide an option to deselect CONFIG_BOUNCE.  The
observation was made while measuring eMMC throughput using iozone on an
ARM device with 1GB RAM.
