rbd: get parent info on refresh

Get parent info for format 2 images on every refresh (rather than
just during the initial probe).  This will be needed to detect the
disappearance of the parent image in the event a mapped image
becomes unlayered (i.e., flattened).  Avoid leaking the previous
parent spec on the second and subsequent times this information is
requested by dropping the previous one (if any) before updating it.
(Also, extract the pool id into a local variable before assigning
it into the parent spec.)

Switch to using a non-zero parent overlap value rather than the
existence of a parent (a non-null parent_spec pointer) to determine
whether to mark a request layered.  It will soon be possible for
a layered image to become unlayered while a request is in flight.

This means that the layered flag for an image request indicates that
there was a non-zero parent overlap at the time the image request
was created.  The parent overlap can change thereafter, which may
lead to special handling at request submission or completion time.

This and the next several patches are related to:

NOTE:
If an error occurs while refreshing the parent info (i.e.,
requesting it after initial probe), the old parent info will
persist.  This is not really correct, and is a scenario that needs
to be addressed.  For now we'll assert that the failure mode is
unlikely, but the issue has been documented in tracker issue 5040.
