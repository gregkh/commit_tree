rbd: reference count parent requests

Keep a reference count for uses of the parent information for an rbd
device.

An initial reference is set in rbd_img_request_create() if the
target image has a parent (with non-zero overlap).  Each image
request for an image with a non-zero parent overlap gets another
reference when it's created, and that reference is dropped when the
request is destroyed.

The initial reference is dropped when the image gets torn down.
