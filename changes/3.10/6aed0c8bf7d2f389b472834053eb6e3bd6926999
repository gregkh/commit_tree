tunnel: use iptunnel_xmit() again

With recent patches from Pravin, most tunnels can't use iptunnel_xmit()
any more, due to ip_select_ident() and skb->ip_summed. But we can just
move these operations out of iptunnel_xmit(), so that tunnels can
use it again.

This by the way fixes a bug in vxlan (missing nf_reset()) for net-next.
