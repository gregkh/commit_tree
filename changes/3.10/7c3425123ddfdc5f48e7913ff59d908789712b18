mm/THP: use pmd_populate() to update the pmd with pgtable_t pointer

We should not use set_pmd_at to update pmd_t with pgtable_t pointer.
set_pmd_at is used to set pmd with huge pte entries and architectures
like ppc64, clear few flags from the pte when saving a new entry.
Without this change we observe bad pte errors like below on ppc64 with
THP enabled.

  BUG: Bad page map in process ld mm=0xc000001ee39f4780 pte:7fc3f37848000001 pmd:c000001ec0000000
