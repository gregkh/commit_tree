mac80211: fix do_stop handling while suspended

When a device is unplugged while suspended, mac80211 is
de-initialized and all interfaces are removed while no
state is actually present in the driver. This can cause
warnings and driver confusion.

Fix this by reordering the do_stop code to not call the
driver when it is suspended, i.e. when there's no state
in the driver anyway.

The previous patches removed a few corner cases in ROC
and virtual monitor interfaces so that now this is safe
to do and no state should be left over.
