KVM: Initialize irqfd from kvm_init().

Currently, eventfd introduces module_init/module_exit functions
to initialize/cleanup the irqfd workqueue. This only works, however,
if no other module_init/module_exit functions are built into the
same module.

Let's just move the initialization and cleanup to kvm_init and kvm_exit.
This way, it is also clearer where kvm startup may fail.
