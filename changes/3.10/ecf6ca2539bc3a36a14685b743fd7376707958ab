iio:ad7923: Implement scale reporting

The driver already claims to support scale reporting in its channel spec, but
doesn't actually implement this yet. This patch uses the regulator API to get
the reference voltage and calculates the scale based on that. The patch also
moves the global configuration bits into a field in the ad7923_state struct,
since depending on the RANGE bit, the range goes either from 0 to VREF or from 0
to 2 * VREF. So we need to know the setting of the RANGE bit when calculating
the scale.
