net: add function to allocate sk_buff head without data area

Add a function to allocate a sk_buff head without any data. This will
be used by memory mapped netlink to attach data from the mmaped area
to the skb.

Additionally change skb_release_all() to check whether the skb has a
data area to allow the skb destructor to clear the data pointer in case
only a head has been allocated.
