powerpc: Replace CPU_FTR_BCTAR with CPU_FTR_ARCH_207S

We are getting low on cpu feature bits. So rather than add a separate bit for
every new Power8 feature, add a bit for arch 2.07 server catagory and use that
instead.

Hijack the value we had for BCTAR, but swap the value with CFAR so that all the
ARCH defines are together.

Note we don't touch CPU_FTR_TM, because it is conditionally enabled if
the kernel is built with TM support.
