[media] mb86a20s: provide CNR stats before FE_HAS_SYNC

State 9 means TS started to be output, and it should be
associated with FE_HAS_SYNC.
The mb86a20scan get CNR statistics at state 7, when frame sync
is obtained.
As CNR may help to adjust the antenna, provide it earlier.
A latter patch could eventually start outputing MER measures
earlier, but that would require a bigger change, and probably
won't be better than the current way, as the time between
changing from state 8 to 9 is generally lower than the time
to get the stats collected.
