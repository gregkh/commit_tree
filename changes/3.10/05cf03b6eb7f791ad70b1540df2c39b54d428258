ARM: OMAP2+: AM33xx: hwmod: Add missing sysc definition to wdt1 entry

This patch adds sysc definitions to the wdt1 hwmod entry, which in-turn
makes sure that sysc idle bit-fields are configured to valid state on
enable/disable callbacks.

With the recent submitted patch from Santosh Shilimkar,
"ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Don't call _init_mpu_rt_base if no sysc"
(commit: 4a98c2d89), it is required to add sysconf
information to each valid hwmod entry, else device will not be
come out from idle state properly and leads to below kernel
crash  -
