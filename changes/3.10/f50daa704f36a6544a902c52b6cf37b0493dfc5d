cgroup: no need to check css refs for release notification

We no longer fail rmdir() when there're still css refs, so we don't
need to check css refs in check_for_release().

This also voids a bug. cgroup_has_css_refs() accesses subsys[i]
without cgroup_mutex, so it can race with cgroup_unload_subsys().

cgroup_has_css_refs()
...
  if (ss == NULL || ss->root != cgrp->root)

if ss pointers to net_cls_subsys, and cls_cgroup module is unloaded
right after the former check but before the latter, the memory that
net_cls_subsys resides has become invalid.
