SSBI: Convert SSBI to device tree

The SSBI bus is exclusive to the Qualcomm MSM targets, and all SoCs
using it will be using device tree.  Convert this driver to indentify
with device tree.

This makes the bus probing a good bit simpler, since the attaching of
child nodes can be represented directly in the devicetree, rather than
having to be inferred by name.
