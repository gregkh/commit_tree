drm/i915: don't check inconsistent modeset state when force-restoring

It will be only consistent once we've restored all the crtcs. Since a
bunch of other callers also want to just restore a single crtc, add a
boolean to disable checking only where it doesn't make sense.

Note that intel_modeset_setup_hw_state already has a call to
intel_modeset_check_state at the end, so we don't reduce the amount of
checking.

v2: Try harder not to create a big patch (Chris).

v3: Even smaller (still Chris). Also fix a trailing space.
