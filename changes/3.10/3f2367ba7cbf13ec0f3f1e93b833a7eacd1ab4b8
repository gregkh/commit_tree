ftrace: Cleanup regex_lock and ftrace_lock around hash updating

Cleanup regex_lock and ftrace_lock locking points around
ftrace_ops hash update code.

The new rule is that regex_lock protects ops->*_hash
read-update-write code for each ftrace_ops. Usually,
hash update is done by following sequence.

1. allocate a new local hash and copy the original hash.
2. update the local hash.
3. move(actually, copy) back the local hash to ftrace_ops.
4. update ftrace entries if needed.
5. release the local hash.

This makes regex_lock protect #1-#4, and ftrace_lock
to protect #3, #4 and adding and removing ftrace_ops from the
ftrace_ops_list. The ftrace_lock protects #3 as well because
the move functions update the entries too.
