NFS4.1 Fix data server connection race

Unlike meta data server mounts which support multiple mount points to
the same server via struct nfs_server, data servers support a single connection.

Concurrent calls to setup the data server connection can race where the first
call allocates the nfs_client struct, and before the cache struct nfs_client
pointer can be set, a second call also tries to setup the connection, finds the
already allocated nfs_client, bumps the reference count, re-initializes the
session,etc. This results in a hanging data server session after umount.
