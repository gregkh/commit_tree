ALSA: usb-audio: Fix autopm error during probing

We've got strange errors in get_ctl_value() in mixer.c during
probing, e.g. on Hercules RMX2 DJ Controller:

  ALSA mixer.c:352 cannot get ctl value: req = 0x83, wValue = 0x201, wIndex = 0xa00, type = 4
  ALSA mixer.c:352 cannot get ctl value: req = 0x83, wValue = 0x200, wIndex = 0xa00, type = 4
  ....

It turned out that the culprit is autopm: snd_usb_autoresume() returns
-ENODEV when called during card->probing = 1.

Since the call itself during card->probing = 1 is valid, let's fix the
return value of snd_usb_autoresume() as success.
