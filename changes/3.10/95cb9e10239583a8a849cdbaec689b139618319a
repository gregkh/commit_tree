NFC: pn533: Fix div by zero while stopping polling

Depends on timing division by zero can happen when user stops
polling.

pn533_stop_poll() resets modulation counter on stop_poll, but
meanwhile we get response for last poll request and try, despite
of stop poll request, to schedule next modulation for polling.
