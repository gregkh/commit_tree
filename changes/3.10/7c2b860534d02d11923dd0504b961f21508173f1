ARM: mcpm: introduce the CPU/cluster power API

This is the basic API used to handle the powering up/down of individual
CPUs in a (multi-)cluster system.  The platform specific backend
implementation has the responsibility to also handle the cluster level
power as well when the first/last CPU in a cluster is brought up/down.
