dm persistent data: support space map resizing

Support extending a dm persistent data metadata space map.

The extend itself is implemented by switching back to the boostrap
allocator and pointing to the new space.  The extra bitmap indexes are
then allocated from the new space, and finally we switch back to the
proper space map ops and tweak the reference counts.
