e1000e: long access timeouts when I217/I218 MAC and PHY are out of sync

When the MAC and PHY are in two different modes (different power levels
and interconnect speeds), it could take a long time before a PHY register
access timed out using the existing MAC-PHY interconnect configuration
coded into the driver for ICH- and PCH-based LOMs.  Introduce an I217/I218-
specific .setup_physical_interface operation which does not override the
interconnect configuration in the NVM.
