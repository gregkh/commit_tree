KVM: nVMX: Provide EFER.LMA saving support

We will need EFER.LMA saving to provide unrestricted guest mode. All
what is missing for this is picking up EFER.LMA from VM_ENTRY_CONTROLS
on L2->L1 switches. If the host does not support EFER.LMA saving,
no change is performed, otherwise we properly emulate for L1 what the
hardware does for L0. Advertise the support, depending on the host
feature.
