SUNRPC: Define rpcsec_gss_info structure

The NFSv4 SECINFO procedure returns a list of security flavors.  Any
GSS flavor also has a GSS tuple containing an OID, a quality-of-
protection value, and a service value, which specifies a particular
GSS pseudoflavor.

For simplicity and efficiency, I'd like to return each GSS tuple
from the NFSv4 SECINFO XDR decoder and pass it straight into the RPC
client.

Define a data structure that is visible to both the NFS client and
the RPC client.  Take structure and field names from the relevant
standards to avoid confusion.
