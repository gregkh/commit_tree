mac80211: use synchronize_rcu() with rcu_barrier()

The RCU docs used to state that rcu_barrier() included a wait
for an RCU grace period; however the comments for rcu_barrier()
as of commit f0a0e6f... "rcu: Clarify memory-ordering properties
of grace-period primitives" contradict this.

So add back synchronize_{rcu,net}() to where they once were,
but keep the rcu_barrier()s for the call_rcu() callbacks.
