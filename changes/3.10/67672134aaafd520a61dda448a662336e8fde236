firewire: ohci: Improve bus reset error messages

Many of the error messages possible from bus_reset_work() do not
contain enough information to distinguish which error condition
occurred nor enough information to evaluate the error afterwards.

Differentiate all error conditions in bus_reset_work(); add
additional information to make error diagnosis possible.
