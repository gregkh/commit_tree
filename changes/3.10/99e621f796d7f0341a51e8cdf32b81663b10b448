syscalls.h: slightly reduce the jungles of macros

a) teach __MAP(num, m, <list of type/name pairs>) to take empty
list (with num being 0, of course)
b) fold types__... and args__... declaration and initialization into
SYSCALL_METADATA(num, ...), making their use conditional on num != 0.
That allows to use the SYSCALL_METADATA instead of its near-duplicate
in SYSCALL_DEFINE0.
c) make SYSCALL_METADATA expand to nothing in case if CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS
is not defined; that allows to make SYSCALL_DEFINE0 and SYSCALL_DEFINEx
definitions independent from CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS.
d) kill SYSCALL_DEFINE - no users left (SYSCALL_DEFINE[0-6] is, of course,
still alive and well).
