ext3: fix data=journal fast mount/umount hang

In data=journal mode, if we unmount the file system before a
transaction has a chance to complete, when the journal inode is being
evicted, we can end up calling into log_wait_commit() for the
last transaction, after the journalling machinery has been shut down.
That triggers the WARN_ONCE in __log_start_commit().

Arguably we should adjust ext3_should_journal_data() to return FALSE
for the journal inode, but the only place it matters is
ext3_evict_inode(), and so it's to save a bit of CPU time, and to make
the patch much more obviously correct by inspection(tm), we'll fix it
by explicitly not trying to waiting for a journal commit when we are
evicting the journal inode, since it's guaranteed to never succeed in
this case.

This can be easily replicated via:

     mount -t ext3 -o data=journal /dev/vdb /vdb ; umount /vdb

This is a port of ext4 fix from Ted Ts'o.
