sh_eth: fix unhandled RFE interrupt

EESR.RFE (receive FIFO overflow) interrupt is enabled by the driver on all SoCs
and sh_eth_error() handles it but it's not present in any initializer/assignment
of the 'eesr_err_check' field of 'struct sh_eth_cpu_data'. This leads to that
interrupt not being handled and cleared, and finally to disabling IRQ and the
driver being non-functional.

Modify DEFAULT_EESR_ERR_CHECK macro and all explicit initializers of the above
mentioned field to contain the EESR.RFE bit. Remove useless backslashes from the
initializers, while at it.
