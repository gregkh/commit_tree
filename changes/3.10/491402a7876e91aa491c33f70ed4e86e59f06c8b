nfsd: fix bug on nfs4 stateid deallocation

NFS4_OO_PURGE_CLOSE is not handled properly. To avoid memory leak, nfs4
stateid which is pointed by oo_last_closed_stid is freed in nfsd4_close(),
but NFS4_OO_PURGE_CLOSE isn't cleared meanwhile. So the stateid released in
THIS close procedure may be freed immediately in the coming encoding function.
Sorry that Signed-off-by was forgotten in last version.
