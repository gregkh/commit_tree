[media] it913x: fix pid filter

I just made commit: "dvb_usb_v2: rework USB streaming logic" that
breaks that driver PID filter.
it913x driver checks use of PID filter directly from DVB USB v2 core
internal variable "adap->pid_filtering" and stores it to own state.
Calling order of .pid_filter_ctrl() and .pid_filter() was changed
and due to that state was updated too late. Update state earlier.
TODO: checking PID filter usage from DVB USB v2 is not very good idea
as PID filter callbacks are called only when PID filter is enabled.
