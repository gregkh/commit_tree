openvswitch: Allow OVS_USERSPACE_ATTR_USERDATA to be variable length.

Until now, the optional OVS_USERSPACE_ATTR_USERDATA attribute had to be
exactly 64 bits long, if it was present.  However, 64 bits is not enough
space to associate as much information with a flow as would be convenient
for some userspace features now under development.  This commit generalizes
the attribute, allowing it to be any length.

This generalization is backward-compatible: if userspace only uses 64-bit
attributes, then it will not see any change in behavior.
