[media] davinci/dm644x_ccdc: fix compiler warning

drivers/media/platform/davinci/dm644x_ccdc.c: In function ‘validate_ccdc_param’:
drivers/media/platform/davinci/dm644x_ccdc.c:233:32: warning: comparison between ‘enum ccdc_gama_width’ and ‘enum ccdc_data_size’ [-Wenum-compare]
It took a bit of work, see this thread of an earlier attempt to fix this:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1923091/
I've chosen not to follow the suggestions in that thread since gamma_width is
really a different property from data_size. What you really want is to know if
gamma_width fits inside data_size and for that you need to translate each
enum into a maximum bit number so you can safely compare the two.
So I put in two static inline translation functions instead, keeping the rest
of the code the same (except for fixing the 'gama' typo).
