[media] media/rc/imon.c: make send_packet() delay larger for 15c2:0036

Some imon devices (like 15c2:0036) need a higher delay between
send_packet calls.

Default value is still 5ms to avoid regressions on already working
hardware.

Also use interruptible wait to avoid load average going too high (and
let caller handle signals).
