[media] blackfin: replace V4L2_IN/OUT_CAP_CUSTOM_TIMINGS by DV_TIMINGS

The use of V4L2_IN/OUT_CAP_CUSTOM_TIMINGS is obsolete, use DV_TIMINGS instead.
Note that V4L2_IN/OUT_CAP_CUSTOM_TIMINGS is just a #define for
V4L2_IN/OUT_CAP_DV_TIMINGS.
At some point in the future these CUSTOM_TIMINGS defines might be removed.
