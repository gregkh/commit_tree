HID: reintroduce fix-up for certain Sony RF receivers

It looks like the manual merge 0d69a3c731e120b05b7da9fb976830475a3fbc01 ("Merge
branches 'for-3.9/sony' and 'for-3.9/steelseries' into for-linus") accidentally
removed Sony RF receiver with USB product id 0x0374 from the "have special
driver" list, effectively nullifying a464918419f94a0043d2f549d6defb4c3f69f68a
("HID: add support for Sony RF receiver with USB product id 0x0374"). Add the
device back to the list.
