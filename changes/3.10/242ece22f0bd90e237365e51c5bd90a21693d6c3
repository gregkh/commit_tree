arch: sparc: prom: looping issue, need additional length check in the outside looping

When "cp >= barg_buf + BARG_LEN-2", it breaks internel looping 'while',
but outside loop 'for' still has effect, so "*cp++ = ' '" will continue
repeating which may cause memory overflow.

So need additional length check for it in the outside looping.

Also beautify the related code which found by "./scripts/checkpatch.pl"
