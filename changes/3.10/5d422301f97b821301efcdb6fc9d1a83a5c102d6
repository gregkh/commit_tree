NFSv4: Fail I/O if the state recovery fails irrevocably

If state recovery fails with an ESTALE or a ENOENT, then we shouldn't
keep retrying. Instead, mark the stateid as being invalid and
fail the I/O with an EIO error.
For other operations such as POSIX and BSD file locking, truncate
etc, fail with an EBADF to indicate that this file descriptor is no
longer valid.
