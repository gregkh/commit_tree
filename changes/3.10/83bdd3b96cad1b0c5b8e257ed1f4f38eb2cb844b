IPoIB: Fix ipoib_hard_header() return value

If you have a patched up dhcp server (and dhclient), they will use
AF_PACKET/SOCK_DGRAM pair to send dhcp packets over IPoIB.

However, when testing an upstream kernel, this has been broken for a
very long time (I tested 2.6.34, 2.6.38, 3.0, 3.1, 3.8, HEAD).

It turns out that the hard_header routine in ipoib is not following
the API and is returning 0 even when it pushed data onto the skb.
This then causes af_packet.c to overwrite the header just pushed with
data from user space.

Fixing this gets DHCP working on IPoIB.
