MPILIB: disable usage of floating point registers on parisc

The umul_ppmm() macro for parisc uses the xmpyu assembler statement
which does calculation via a floating point register.

But usage of floating point registers inside the Linux kernel are not
allowed and gcc will stop compilation due to the -mdisable-fpregs
compiler option.

Fix this by disabling the umul_ppmm() and udiv_qrnnd() macros. The
mpilib will then use the generic built-in implementations instead.
