ALSA: USB: adjust for changed 3.8 USB API

The recent changes in the USB API ("implement new semantics for
URB_ISO_ASAP") made the former meaning of the URB_ISO_ASAP flag the
default, and changed this flag to mean that URBs can be delayed.
This is not the behaviour wanted by any of the audio drivers because
it leads to discontinuous playback with very small period sizes.
Therefore, our URBs need to be submitted without this flag.
