xenbus: delay xenbus frontend resume if xenstored is not running

If the xenbus frontend is located in a domain running xenstored, the device
resume is hanging because it is happening before the process resume. This
patch adds extra logic to the resume code to check if we are the domain
running xenstored and delay the resume if needed.

[Changes in v2:
- Instead of bypassing the resume, process it in a workqueue]
[Changes in v3:

- Several small code fixes]
