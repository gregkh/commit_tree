rbd: encapsulate submission of image object requests

Object requests that are part of an image request are subject to
some additional handling.  Define rbd_img_obj_request_submit() to
encapsulate that, and use it when initially submitting an image
object request, and when re-submitting it during callback of
an object existence check.
