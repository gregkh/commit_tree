powerpc/perf: Add support for SIER

On power8 we have a new SIER (Sampled Instruction Event Register), which
captures information about instructions when we have random sampling
enabled.

Add support for loading the SIER into pt_regs, overloading regs->dar.
Also set the new NO_SIPR flag in regs->result if we don't have SIPR.

Update regs_sihv/sipr() to look for SIPR/SIHV in SIER.
