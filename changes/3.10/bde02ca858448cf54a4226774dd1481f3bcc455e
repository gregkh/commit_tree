audit: use spin_lock_irqsave/restore in audit tty code

Some of the callers of the audit tty function use spin_lock_irqsave/restore.
We were using the forced always enable version, which seems really bad.
Since I don't know every one of these code paths well enough, it makes
sense to just switch everything to the safe version.  Maybe it's a
little overzealous, but it's a lot better than an unlucky deadlock when
we return to a caller with irq enabled and they expect it to be
disabled.
