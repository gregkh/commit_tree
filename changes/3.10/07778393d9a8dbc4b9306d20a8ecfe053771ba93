staging: comedi: pre-lock mutex on creation of comedi device

Return from `comedi_alloc_board_minor()` with the mutex of the created
`struct comedi_device` pre-locked.  This allows further initialization
by the caller without the worry of something getting in there first.

`comedi_auto_config()` no longer needs to check if the device is already
"attached" since whatever was trying to attach the device would need to
have locked the mutex first.
