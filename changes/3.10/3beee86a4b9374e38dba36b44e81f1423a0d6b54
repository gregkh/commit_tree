virtio: Introduce vringh wrappers in virtio_config

Add wrappers for the host vrings to support loose
coupling between the virtio device and driver.

A new struct vringh_config_ops with the functions
find_vrhs() and del_vrhs() is added to the virtio_device
struct. This enables virtio drivers to manage virtio
host rings without detailed knowledge of how the
vrings are created and deleted.

The function vringh_notify() is added so vringh clients
can notify the other side that buffers are added to the
used-ring.
