kprobes/x86: Just return error for sanity check failure instead of using BUG_ON

Return an error from __copy_instruction() and use printk() to
give us a more productive message, since this is just an error
case which we can handle and also the BUG_ON() never tells us
why and what happened.

This is related to the following bug-report:
