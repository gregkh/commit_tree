staging: comedi: s626: remove the uint16_t casts of the bit values

There are a number of uint16_t casts used in the #define's of the
constant bit field values as well as the calls to DEBIreplace().
These cause a number of sparse warnings of the type:

warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (ffff1cff becomes 1cff)

Remove all of the casts and change the types of the parameters to
DEBIreplace from uin16_t to unsigned int. This fixes all the warnings.

Mask the addr that is or'ed with DEBI_CMD_RDWORD then written to the
P_DEBICMD register as well as the val written to the P_DEBIAD register
with 0xffff. The addr and val are only 16-bits but the registers are
32-bits.
