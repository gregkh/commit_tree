Bluetooth: hidp: add new session-management helpers

This is a rewrite of the HIDP session management. It implements HIDP as an
l2cap_user sub-module so we get proper notification when the underlying
connection goes away.

The helpers are not yet used but only added in this commit. The old
session management is still used and will be removed in a following patch.

The old session-management was flawed. Hotplugging is horribly broken and
we have no way of getting notified when the underlying connection goes
down. The whole idea of removing the HID/input sub-devices from within the
session itself is broken and suffers from major dead-locks. We never can
guarantee that the session can unregister itself as long as we use
synchronous shutdowns. This can only work with asynchronous shutdowns.
However, in this case we _must_ be able to unregister the session from the
outside as otherwise the l2cap_conn object might be unlinked before we
are.

The new session-management is based on l2cap_user. There is only one
way how to add a session and how to delete a session: "probe" and "remove"
callbacks from l2cap_user.
This guarantees that the session can be registered and unregistered at
_any_ time without any synchronous shutdown.
On the other hand, much work has been put into proper session-refcounting.
We can unregister/unlink the session only if we can guarantee that it will
stay alive. But for asynchronous shutdowns we never know when the last
user goes away so we must use proper ref-counting.

The old ->conn field has been renamed to ->hconn so we can reuse ->conn in
the new session management. No other existing HIDP code is modified.
