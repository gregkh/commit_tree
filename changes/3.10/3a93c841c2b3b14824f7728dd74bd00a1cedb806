iommu/vt-d: Disable translation if already enabled

This patch disables translation(dma-remapping) before its initialization
if it is already enabled.

This is needed for kexec/kdump boot. If dma-remapping is enabled in the
first kernel, it need to be disabled before initializing its page table
during second kernel boot. Wei Hu also reported that this is needed
when second kernel boots with intel_iommu=off.

Basically iommu->gcmd is used to know whether translation is enabled or
disabled, but it is always zero at boot time even when translation is
enabled since iommu->gcmd is initialized without considering such a
case. Therefor this patch synchronizes iommu->gcmd value with global
command register when iommu structure is allocated.
