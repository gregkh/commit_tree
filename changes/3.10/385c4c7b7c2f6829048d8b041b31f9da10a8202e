ARM: OMAP: Force dmtimer restore if context loss is not detectable

When booting with device-tree the function pointer for detecting context
loss is not populated. Ideally, the pm_runtime framework should be
enhanced to allow a means for reporting context/state loss and we could
avoid populating such function pointers altogether. In the interim until
a generic non-device specific solution is in place, force a restore of
the dmtimer when enabling the timer.
