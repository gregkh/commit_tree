kvm/ppc/booke: Delay kvmppc_lazy_ee_enable

kwmppc_lazy_ee_enable() should be called as late as possible,
or else we get things like WARN_ON(preemptible()) in enable_kernel_fp()
in configurations where preemptible() works.

Note that book3s_pr already waits until just before __kvmppc_vcpu_run
to call kvmppc_lazy_ee_enable().
