powerpc: Context switch more PMU related SPRs

In commit 9353374 "Context switch the new EBB SPRs" we added support for
context switching some new EBB SPRs. However despite four of us signing
off on that patch we missed some. To be fair these are not actually new
SPRs, but they are now potentially user accessible so need to be context
switched.
