ring-buffer: Add ring buffer startup selftest

When testing my large changes to the ftrace system, there was
a bug that looked like the ring buffer was dropping events.
I wrote up a quick integrity checker of the ring buffer to
see if it was.

Although the bug ended up being something stupid I did in ftrace,
and had nothing to do with the ring buffer, I figured if I spent
the time to write up this test, I might as well include it in the
kernel.

I cleaned it up a bit, as the original version was rather ugly.
Not saying this version is pretty, but it's a beauty queen
compared to what I original wrote.

To enable the start up test, set CONFIG_RING_BUFFER_STARTUP_TEST.

Note, it runs for 10 seconds, so it will slow your boot time
by at least 10 more seconds.

What it does is documented in both the comments and the Kconfig
help.
