x86, relocs: Consolidate processing logic

Instead of counting and then processing relocations, do it in a single
pass. This splits the processing logic into separate functions for
realmode and 32-bit (and paves the way for 64-bit). Also extracts helper
functions when emitting relocations.

Based on work by Neill Clift and Michael Davidson.
