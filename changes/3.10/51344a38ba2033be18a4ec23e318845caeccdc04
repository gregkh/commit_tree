rbd: always set read-only flag in rbd_add()

Hold off setting the read-only flag in rbd_add() for an image being
mapped until we have successfully probed the image.  At that point
we know whether it's a snapshot mapping or not, so we can set the
read-only flag in that one place rather than doing so (for
snapshots) in rbd_dev_mapping_set().  To do this, pass a flag to the
image probe routine indicating whether we want a read-only mapping.
