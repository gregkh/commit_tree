ALSA: snd-usb: use ep->stride from urb callbacks

For normal PCM transfer, this change has no effect, as the endpoint's
stride is always frame_bits/8. For DSD DOP streams, however, which is
added later, the hardware stride differs from the software stride, and
the endpoint has the correct information in these cases.
