powerpc/powernv: Add option CONFIG_POWERNV_MSI

As Michael Ellerman suggested, to add CONFIG_POWERNV_MSI for PowerNV
platform. That's similar to CONFIG_PSERIES_MSI for pSeries platform.
For now, we don't make it dependent on CONFIG_EEH since it's not ready
to enable that yet.

Apart from that, we also enable CONFIG_PPC_MSI_BITMAP on selecting
CONFIG_POWERNV_MSI.
