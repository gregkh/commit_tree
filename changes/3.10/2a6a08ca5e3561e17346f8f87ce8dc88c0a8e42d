dtc: Update generated files to output from Bison 2.5

This patch merely updates the generated dtc parser and lexer files to
the output generated by Bison 2.5. The previous versions were generated
from version 2.4.1. The only reason for this commit is to minimize the
diff on the next commit which fixes a bug in the DTC #line directive
parsing. Otherwise the Bison changes would be intermingled with the
functional changes.
