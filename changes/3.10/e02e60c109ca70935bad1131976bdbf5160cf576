sched: Prevent to re-select dst-cpu in load_balance()

Commit 88b8dac0 makes load_balance() consider other cpus in its
group. But, in that, there is no code for preventing to
re-select dst-cpu. So, same dst-cpu can be selected over and
over.

This patch add functionality to load_balance() in order to
exclude cpu which is selected once. We prevent to re-select
dst_cpu via env's cpus, so now, env's cpus is a candidate not
only for src_cpus, but also dst_cpus.

With this patch, we can remove lb_iterations and
max_lb_iterations, because we decide whether we can go ahead or
not via env's cpus.
