usb: dwc3: omap: minor fixes to get dt working

Includes few minor fixes in dwc3-omap like populating the compatible
string in a correct way, extracting the utmi-mode property properly and
changing the index of get_irq since irq of core is removed from hwmod
entry.

Also updated the documentation with dwc3-omap device tree binding
information.
