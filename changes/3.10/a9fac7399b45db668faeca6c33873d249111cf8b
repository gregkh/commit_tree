ssb: pci: Fix flipping of MAC address

Since commit e565275 entitled "ssb: pci: Standardize a function to get mac
address", the SPROM readout of the MAC has had the values flipped so that
00:11:22:33:44:55 became 11:00:33:22:55:44. The fix has been tested on both
little- and big-endian architectures.
