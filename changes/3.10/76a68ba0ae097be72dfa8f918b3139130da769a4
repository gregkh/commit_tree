Bluetooth: rename hci_conn_put to hci_conn_drop

We use _get() and _put() for device ref-counting in the kernel. However,
hci_conn_put() is _not_ used for ref-counting, hence, rename it to
hci_conn_drop() so we can later fix ref-counting and introduce
hci_conn_put().

hci_conn_hold() and hci_conn_put() are currently used to manage how long a
connection should be held alive. When the last user drops the connection,
we spawn a delayed work that performs the disconnect. Obviously, this has
nothing to do with ref-counting for the _object_ but rather for the
keep-alive of the connection.

But we really _need_ proper ref-counting for the _object_ to allow
connection-users like rfcomm-tty, HIDP or others.
