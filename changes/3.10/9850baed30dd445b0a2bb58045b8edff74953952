powerpc: remove dead CONFIG_HVC_SCOM code

Commit c1fb6816fb1b78dd94b673b0fdaa9a7a16e97bd1 ("powerpc: Add
relocation on exception vector handlers") added two lines of code that
depend on the macro CONFIG_HVC_SCOM. That macro doesn't exist. Perhaps
it was intended to use CONFIG_PPC_SCOM here. But since
"maintence_interrupt" is a typo and there's nothing in arch/powerpc that
looks like maintenance_interrupt it seems best to just delete these
lines.
