clk: Unprepare the unused prepared slow clocks at late init

The unused ungated fast clocks are already being disabled from
clk_disable_unused at late init. This patch extend this sequence
to the slow unused prepared clocks to be unprepared.

Unless the optional .is_prepared callback is implemented by a
clk_hw the clk_disable_unused sequence will not unprepare any
unused clocks, since it will fall back to use the software
prepare counter.
