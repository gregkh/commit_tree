pinctrl: select_state: don't call pinctrl_free_setting on error

As Stephen Warren pointed out, pinctrl_free_setting() was called instead
of pinmux_disable_setting() on error.
In this error code, we want to call pinmux_disable_setting() where
pinmux_enable_setting() was called.
And when pinconf_apply_setting() was called, we can't do much to undo
the pin muxing (the closest thing I can think about for "unmuxing" a pin
is muxing it as GPIO input).
