USB: ch341: fix TIOCMIWAIT and disconnect

Use tty-port modem-status-change wait queue on which processes are woken
up at hangup and disconnect.

Currently a process waiting on modem-status changes will not be woken on
device disconnect as wake up was only done in dtr_rts which isn't
guaranteed to be called (e.g. if HUPCL is not set).

Also remove the redundant wake-up call from dtr_rts.
