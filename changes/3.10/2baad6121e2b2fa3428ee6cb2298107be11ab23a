x86, crc32-pclmul: Fix build with older binutils

binutils prior to 2.18 (e.g. the ones found on SLE10) don't support
assembling PEXTRD, so a macro based approach like the one for PCLMULQDQ
in the same file should be used.

This requires making the helper macros capable of recognizing 32-bit
general purpose register operands.

[ hpa: tagging for stable as it is a low risk build fix ]
