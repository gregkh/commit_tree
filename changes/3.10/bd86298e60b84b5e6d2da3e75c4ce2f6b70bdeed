ext4: introduce ext4_get_group_number()

Currently on many places in ext4 we're using
ext4_get_group_no_and_offset() even though we're only interested in
knowing the block group of the particular block, not the offset within
the block group so we can use more efficient way to compute block
group.

This patch introduces ext4_get_group_number() which computes block
group for a given block much more efficiently. Use this function
instead of ext4_get_group_no_and_offset() everywhere where we're only
interested in knowing the block group.
