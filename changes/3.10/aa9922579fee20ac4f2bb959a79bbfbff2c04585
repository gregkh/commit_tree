staging:iio:magnetometer:ak8975 drop I2C_M_NOSTART flag in read_data

This flag makes no sense whatsoever where it is.
Documentation/i2c/i2c-protocol states:

  If you set the I2C_M_NOSTART variable for the first partial message,
  we do not generate Addr, but we do generate the startbit S. This will
  probably confuse all other clients on your bus, so don't try this.

This is exactly what is going on here.  Likelihood given that the
driver never checked for this protocol mangling being available is that
it wasn't present on the test boards and hence this flag was simply
ignored.  No indication of why it would be necessary has been found in
the datasheets.
