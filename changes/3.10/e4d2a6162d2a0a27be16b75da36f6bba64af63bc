[media] tuner: add Sony BTF tuners

This adds support for three Sony BTF tuners:
TUNER_SONY_BTF_PG472Z: PAL+SECAM
TUNER_SONY_BTF_PK467Z: NTSC-M-JP
TUNER_SONY_BTF_PB463Z: NTSC-M
These come from the go7007 staging driver where they were implemented in
the wis-sony-tuner i2c driver.
Adding support for these tuners to tuner-types.c is the first step towards
removing the wis-sony-tuner driver.
