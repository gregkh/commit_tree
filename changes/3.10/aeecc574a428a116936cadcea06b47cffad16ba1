brcmfmac: use skb_cow() in brcmf_sdbrcm_txpkt() to assure alignment

In brcmf_sdbrcm_txpkt() a new packet is allocated and used to transmit
to firmware freeing up the original packet. However, that packet is
still referenced in firmware-signalling so this would result in a
double free. Using skb_cow() avoids this as the packet reference is
unchanged.
