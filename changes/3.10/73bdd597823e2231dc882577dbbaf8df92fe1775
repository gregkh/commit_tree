ALSA: hda - Implement headset jack functionality for some Dell hw

On some machines, there is a headset jack that can support both
headphone, headsets (of both CTIA and OMTP type) and mic-in.

On other machines, the headset jack supports headphone, headsets
(both CTIA and OMTP), but not mic-in.

This patch implements that functionality as different capture sources.
