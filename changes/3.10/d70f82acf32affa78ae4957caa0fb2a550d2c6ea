genksyms: pass symbol-prefix instead of arch

Pass symbol-prefix to genksyms instead of arch, so that the decision
what symbol prefix to use is kept in one place.

Basically genksyms used to take a -a $ARCH argument and it used that to
determine whether to add an underscore symbol prefix. It's now changed
to take a -s $SYMBOL_PREFIX argument so that the caller decides whether
a symbol prefix is required. The build system then uses
CONFIG_HAVE_UNDERSCORE_SYMBOL_PREFIX to determine whether to pass the
argument.
