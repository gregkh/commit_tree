powerpc/fsl: remove the PPC_CLOCK dependency

Config FSL_SOC does not depend on PPC_CLOCK anymore since the following
commit got merged: 93abe8e (clk: add non CONFIG_HAVE_CLK routines)
Config CPM does not use PPC_CLOCK either currently. So remove them.

PPC_CLOCK also keeps Freescale PowerPC archtecture from supporting COMMON_CLK.
