uretprobes: Limit the depth of return probe nestedness

Unlike the kretprobes we can't trust userspace, thus must have
protection from user space attacks. User-space have  "unlimited"
stack, and this patch limits the return probes nestedness as a
simple remedy for it.

Note that this implementation leaks return_instance on siglongjmp
until exit()/exec().

The intention is to have KISS and bare minimum solution for the
initial implementation in order to not complicate the uretprobes
code.

In the future we may come up with more sophisticated solution that
remove this depth limitation. It is not easy task and lays beyond
this patchset.
