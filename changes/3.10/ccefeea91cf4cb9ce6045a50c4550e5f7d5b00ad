ARM: ux500: always select ABX500_CORE

We are probably selecting more drivers than we should in ux500,
but cleaning up that logic for good can be left for another
time. Most of these could be converted into silent options in
the future, since they are always enabled on ux500 and never
needed elsewhere.

As a fixup for 3.10, let's at least select the dependencies for
the other drivers we already select, to make it consistent.

warning: (UX500_SOC_COMMON) selects AB8500_CORE which has unmet direct dependencies (HAS_IOMEM && GENERIC_HARDIRQS && ABX500_CORE && MFD_DB8500_PRCMU)
