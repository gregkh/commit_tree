bonding: fix locking in enslave failure path

In commit 3c5913b53fefc9d9e15a2d0f93042766658d9f3f ("bonding:
primary_slave & curr_active_slave are not cleaned on enslave failure")
I didn't account for the use of curr_active_slave without curr_slave_lock
and since there are such users, we should hold bond->lock for writing while
setting it to NULL (in the NULL case we don't need the curr_slave_lock).
Keeping the bond lock as to avoid the extra release/acquire cycle.
