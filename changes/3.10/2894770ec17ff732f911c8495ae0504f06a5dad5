ASoC: tlv320aic3x: Remove deadlock from snd_soc_dapm_put_volsw_aic3x()

When calling snd_soc_dapm_sync(), it eventually tries to lock the same mutex
already locked in snd_soc_dapm_put_volsw_aic3x() and a deadlock occurs. By
moving the mutex unlock to just before snd_soc_dapm_sync(), this deadlock is
prevented. This problem was introduced in Linux 3.5
