[media] soc-camera: fix typos in the default format-conversion table

The default format conversion table mbus_fmt[] in soc_mediabus.c lists
"natural" conversions between media-bus and fourcc pixel formats, that are
achieved by storing data from the bus in RAM exactly as it arrives, only
possibly padding missing high or low bits. Such data acquisition mode
cannot change data endianness, therefore two locations with opposite
endianness are erroneous. This change might affest the omap1-camera driver,
existing configurations should be verified.
