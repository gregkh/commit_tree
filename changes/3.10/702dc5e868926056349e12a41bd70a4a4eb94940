[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix issue in passing the exp_cmdsn and max_cmdsn

Command Window value from the CQE was used to calculate the
max_cmdsn for that session.The command window value extracted
for SKH-R adapter was not proper. The value was extracted from
BE adapter completion event. Fixed the issue by getting the
cmd_wnd value from SKH-R CQE.

The exp_cmdsn and max_cmdsn values were not converted to BE format
before calling the __iscsi_complete_pdu(). Fixed the issue of converting
to BE format.
