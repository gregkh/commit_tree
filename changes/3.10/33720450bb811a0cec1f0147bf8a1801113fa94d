Bluetooth: Fix HCI request framework

Some HCI commands don't send a Command Complete Event once the HCI
command has completed so they require some special handling from the
HCI request framework. These HCI commands, however, send a Command
Status Event to indicate that the command has been received, and
that the controller is currently performing the task for the command.

So, in order to properly handle those HCI commands, the HCI request
framework should consider the HCI command has completed once the
Command Status Event is received.

This way, we fix some issues regarding the Inquiry command support,
as well as add support for all those HCI commands which would require
some special handling from the HCI request framework.
