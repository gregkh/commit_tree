ALSA: usb-audio: UAC2: do clock validity check earlier

Move the check that parse_audio_format_rates_v2() do after
receiving the clock source entity ID directly into the find
function and add a validation flag to the function.

This patch does not introduce any logic flow change.

It is provided to allow introducing automatic clock switching
easier later. By moving this uac_clock_source_is_valid callsite,
2 additional callsites can be avoided.
