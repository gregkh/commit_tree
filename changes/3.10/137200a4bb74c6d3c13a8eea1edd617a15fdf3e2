IB/ipath: Correct ipath_verbs_register_sysfs() error handling

ipath_verbs_register_sysfs() never returned the correct error
code from device_create_file and never cleaned up from a failure.
Additionally, the caller of ipath_verbs_register_sysfs() doesn't
return the correct "ret" value.

This patch resolves all of these issues.
