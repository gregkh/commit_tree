mm: frontswap: lazy initialization to allow tmem backends to build/run as modules

With the goal of allowing tmem backends (zcache, ramster, Xen tmem) to
be built/loaded as modules rather than built-in and enabled by a boot
parameter, this patch provides "lazy initialization", allowing backends
to register to frontswap even after swapon was run.  Before a backend
registers all calls to init are recorded and the creation of tmem_pools
delayed until a backend registers or until a frontswap store is
attempted.
