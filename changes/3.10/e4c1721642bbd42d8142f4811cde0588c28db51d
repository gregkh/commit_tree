xfrm: force a garbage collection after deleting a policy

In some cases after deleting a policy from the SPD the policy would
remain in the dst/flow/route cache for an extended period of time
which caused problems for SELinux as its dynamic network access
controls key off of the number of XFRM policy and state entries.
This patch corrects this problem by forcing a XFRM garbage collection
whenever a policy is sucessfully removed.
