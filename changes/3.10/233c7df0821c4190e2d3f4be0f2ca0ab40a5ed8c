macvlan: fix passthru mode race between dev removal and rx path

Currently, if macvlan in passthru mode is created and data are rxed and
you remove this device, following panic happens:

NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000198
IP: [<ffffffffa0196058>] macvlan_handle_frame+0x153/0x1f7 [macvlan]

I'm using following script to trigger this:
<script>
while [ 1 ]
do
	ip link add link e1 name macvtap0 type macvtap mode passthru
	ip link set e1 up
	ip link set macvtap0 up
	IFINDEX=`ip link |grep macvtap0 | cut -f 1 -d ':'`
	cat /dev/tap$IFINDEX  >/dev/null &
	ip link del dev macvtap0
done
</script>

I run this script while "ping -f" is running on another machine to send
packets to e1 rx.

Reason of the panic is that list_first_entry() is blindly called in
macvlan_handle_frame() even if the list was empty. vlan is set to
incorrect pointer which leads to the crash.

I'm fixing this by protecting port->vlans list by rcu and by preventing
from getting incorrect pointer in case the list is empty.
