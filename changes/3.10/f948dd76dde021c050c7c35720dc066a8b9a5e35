xfs: add CRC checks to remote symlinks

Add a header to the remote symlink block, containing location and
owner information, as well as CRCs and LSN fields. This requires
verifiers to be added to the remote symlink buffers for CRC enabled
filesystems.

This also fixes a bug reading multiple block symlinks, where the second
block overwrites the first block when copying out the link name.
