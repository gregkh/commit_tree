ext4: speed-up releasing blocks on commit

Improve mb_free_blocks speed by clearing entire range at once instead
of iterating over each bit. Freeing block-by-block also makes buddy
bitmap subtree flip twice making most of the work a no-op. Very few
bits in buddy bitmap require change, e.g. freeing entire group is a 1
bit flip only.  As a result, releasing blocks of 60G file now takes
5ms instead of 2.7s.  This is especially good for non-preemptive
kernels as there is no rescheduling during release.
