      brcmsmac: remove brcms_bss_cfg->associated

The regression behaviour was described on mailing list.

http://mid.gmane.org/5197DC4F.7030503@broadcom.com:
"On laptop I installed kernel with brcmsmac compiled as
module. It comes up and associates during boot, but after
logging in there is no connectivity. Triggering reassoc
gives connectivity for some time, but after a while (1-2 min)
it stops."

Before the mentioned commit the return value of
the function brcms_c_ps_allowed() was always false,
which is desired behaviour as power-save is not
supported at the moment. Therefor, the function is
changed to just return false instead of simply
reverting the mentioned commit.
