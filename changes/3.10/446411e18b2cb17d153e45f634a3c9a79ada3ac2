spi: Initialize cs_gpio and cs_gpios with -ENOENT

The return value from of_get_named_gpio is -ENOENT when the given index
matches a hole in the "cs-gpios" property phandle list. However, the
default value of cs_gpio in struct spi_device and entries of cs_gpios in
struct spi_master is -EINVAL, which is documented to indicate that a
GPIO line should not be used for the given spi_device.

This sets the default value of cs_gpio in struct spi_device and entries
of cs_gpios in struct spi_master to -ENOENT. Thus, -ENOENT is the only
value used to indicate that no GPIO line should be used.
