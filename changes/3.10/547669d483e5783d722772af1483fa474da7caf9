tcp: xps: fix reordering issues

commit 3853b5841c01a ("xps: Improvements in TX queue selection")
introduced ooo_okay flag, but the condition to set it is slightly wrong.

In our traces, we have seen ACK packets being received out of order,
and RST packets sent in response.

We should test if we have any packets still in host queue.
