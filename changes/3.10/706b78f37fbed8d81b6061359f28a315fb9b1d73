dtc: ensure #line directives don't consume data from the next line

Previously, the #line parsing regex ended with ({WS}+[0-9]+)?. The {WS}
could match line-break characters. If the #line directive did not contain
the optional flags field at the end, this could cause any integer data on
the next line to be consumed as part of the #line directive parsing. This
could cause syntax errors (i.e. #line parsing consuming the leading 0
from a hex literal 0x1234, leaving x1234 to be parsed as cell data,
which is a syntax error), or invalid compilation results (i.e. simply
consuming literal 1234 as part of the #line processing, thus removing it
from the cell data).

Fix this by replacing {WS} with [ \t] so that it can't match line-breaks.

Convert all instances of {WS}, even though the other instances should be
irrelevant for any well-formed #line directive. This is done for
consistency and ultimate safety.
