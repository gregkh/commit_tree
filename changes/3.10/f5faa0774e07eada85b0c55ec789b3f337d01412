workqueue: use %current instead of worker->task in worker_maybe_bind_and_lock()

worker_maybe_bind_and_lock() uses both @worker->task and @current at
the same time.  As worker_maybe_bind_and_lock() can only be called by
the current worker task, they are always the same.

Update worker_maybe_bind_and_lock() to use %current consistently.

This doesn't introduce any functional change.
