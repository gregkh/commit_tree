perf/x86/intel/P4: Robistify P4 PMU types

Linus found, while extending integer type extension checks in the
sparse static code checker, various fragile patterns of mixed
signed/unsigned  64-bit/32-bit integer use in perf_events_p4.c.

The relevant hardware register ABI is 64 bit wide on 32-bit
kernels as  well, so clean it all up a bit, remove unnecessary
casts, and make sure we  use 64-bit unsigned integers in these
places.

[ Unfortunately this patch was not tested on real P4 hardware,
  those are pretty rare already. If this patch causes any
  problems on P4 hardware then please holler ... ]
