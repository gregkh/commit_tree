nohz: Assign timekeeping duty to a CPU outside the full dynticks range

This way the full nohz CPUs can safely run with the tick
stopped with a guarantee that somebody else is taking
care of the jiffies and GTOD progression.

Once the duty is attributed to a CPU, it won't change. Also that
CPU can't enter into dyntick idle mode or be hot unplugged.

This may later be improved from a power consumption POV. At
least we should be able to share the duty amongst all CPUs
outside the full dynticks range. Then the duty could even be
shared with full dynticks CPUs when those can't stop their
tick for any reason.

But let's start with that very simple approach first.
