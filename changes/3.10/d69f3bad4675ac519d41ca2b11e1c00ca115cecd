ipc: sysv shared memory limited to 8TiB

Trying to run an application which was trying to put data into half of
memory using shmget(), we found that having a shmall value below 8EiB-8TiB
would prevent us from using anything more than 8TiB.  By setting
kernel.shmall greater than 8EiB-8TiB would make the job work.

In the newseg() function, ns->shm_tot which, at 8TiB is INT_MAX.

ipc/shm.c:
 458 static int newseg(struct ipc_namespace *ns, struct ipc_params *params)
 459 {
...
 465         int numpages = (size + PAGE_SIZE -1) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
...
 474         if (ns->shm_tot + numpages > ns->shm_ctlall)
 475                 return -ENOSPC;

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: make ipc/shm.c:newseg()'s numpages size_t, not int]
