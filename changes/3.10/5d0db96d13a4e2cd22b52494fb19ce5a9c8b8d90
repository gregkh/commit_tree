dm thin: open dev read only when possible

If a thin pool is created in read-only-metadata mode then only open the
metadata device read-only.

Previously it was always opened with FMODE_READ | FMODE_WRITE.

(Note that dm_get_device() still allows read-only dm devices to be used
read-write at the moment: If I create a read-only linear device for the
metadata, via dmsetup load --readonly, then I can still create a rw pool
out of it.)
