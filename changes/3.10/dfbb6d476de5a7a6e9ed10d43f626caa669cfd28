iommu/amd: Don't report firmware bugs with cmd-line ivrs overrides

When the IVRS entries for IOAPIC and HPET are overridden on
the kernel command line, a problem detected in the check
function might not be a firmware bug anymore. So disable
the firmware bug reporting if the user provided valid
ivrs_ioapic or ivrs_hpet entries on the command line.
