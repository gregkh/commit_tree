ieee802154/nl-mac.c: make some MLME operations optional

Check for NULL before calling the following operations from "struct
ieee802154_mlme_ops": assoc_req, assoc_resp, disassoc_req, start_req,
and scan_req.

This fixes a current oops where those functions are called but not
implemented. It also updates the documentation to clarify that they
are now optional by design. If a call to an unimplemented function
is attempted, the kernel returns EOPNOTSUPP via netlink.

The following operations are still required: get_phy, get_pan_id,
get_short_addr, and get_dsn.

Note that the places where this patch changes the initialization
of "ret" should not affect the rest of the code since "ret" was
always set (again) before returning its value.
