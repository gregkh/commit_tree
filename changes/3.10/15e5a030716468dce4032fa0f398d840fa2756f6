net_sched: better precise estimation on packet length for untrusted packets

gso_segs were reset to zero when kernel receive packets from untrusted
source. But we use this zero value to estimate precise packet len which is
wrong. So this patch tries to estimate the correct gso_segs value before using
it in qdisc_pkt_len_init().
