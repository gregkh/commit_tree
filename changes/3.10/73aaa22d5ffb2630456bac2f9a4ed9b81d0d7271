jfs: fix a couple races

This patch fixes races uncovered by xfstests testcase 068.

One race is the result of jfs_sync() trying to write a sync point to the
journal after it has been frozen (or possibly in the process). Since
freezing sync's the journal, there is no need to write a sync point so
we simply want to return.

The second involves jfs_write_inode() being called on a deleted inode.
It calls jfs_flush_journal which is held up by the jfs_commit thread
doing the final iput on the same deleted inode, which itself is
waiting for the I_SYNC flag to be cleared. jfs_write_inode need not
do anything when i_nlink is zero, which is the easy fix.
