rbd: fix cleanup in rbd_add()

Bjorn Helgaas pointed out that a recent commit introduced a
use-after-free condition in an error path for rbd_add().
He correctly stated:

    I think b536f69a3a5 "rbd: set up devices only for mapped images"
    introduced a use-after-free error in rbd_add():
	...
    If rbd_dev_device_setup() returns an error, we call
    rbd_dev_image_release(), which ultimately kfrees rbd_dev.
    Then we call rbd_dev_destroy(), which references fields in
    the already-freed rbd_dev struct before kfreeing it again.

The simple fix is to return the error code after the call to
rbd_dev_image_release().

Closer examination revealed that there's no need to clean up
rbd_opts in that function, so fix that too.

Update some other comments that have also become out of date.
