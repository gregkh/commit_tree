dsa: fix freeing of sparse port allocation

If we have defined a sparse port allocation which is non-contiguous and
contains gaps, the code freeing port_names will just stop when it
encouters a first NULL port_names, which is not right, we should iterate
over all possible number of ports (DSA_MAX_PORTS) until we are done.
