rbd: fix image request leak on parent read

When a read for a layered image object finds the target object
doesn't exist, a read image request for the parent image is created
and submitted.  When that completes, the callback routine was
not releasing that parent image request.  Fix that.

The slab allocation stuff just added has greatly simplified the
search for the source of this memory leak.
