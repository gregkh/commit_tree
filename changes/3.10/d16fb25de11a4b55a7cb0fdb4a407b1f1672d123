ARM: dts: OMAP4460: Add CPU OPP table

Add DT OPP table for OMAP4460 family of devices. This data is
decoded by OF with of_init_opp_table() helper function.

OPP data here is based on existing opp4xxx_data.c

This is in preparation to use generic cpufreq-cpu0 driver for device
tree enabled boot. Legacy non device tree enabled boot continues to
use omap-cpufreq.c and opp4xxx_data.c.
