aio: change reqs_active to include unreaped completions

The aio code tries really hard to avoid having to deal with the
completion ringbuffer overflowing.  To do that, it has to keep track of
the number of outstanding kiocbs, and the number of completions
currently in the ringbuffer - and it's got to check that every time we
allocate a kiocb.  Ouch.

But - we can improve this quite a bit if we just change reqs_active to
mean "number of outstanding requests and unreaped completions" - that
means kiocb allocation doesn't have to look at the ringbuffer, which is
a fairly significant win.
