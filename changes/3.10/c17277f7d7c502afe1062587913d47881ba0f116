TTY: ircomm, use GFP_KERNEL in ircomm_open()

Hi Greg,

I'm unsure if you or Dave should take that one as it's for one a TTY
patch but also living under net/. So I'm uncertain and let you decide!

Thanks,
Mathias

Subject: [PATCH] TTY: ircomm, use GFP_KERNEL in ircomm_open()

We're clearly running in non-atomic context as our only call site is
able to call wait_event_interruptible(). So we're safe to use GFP_KERNEL
here instead of GFP_ATOMIC.
