workqueue: protect wq->nr_drainers and ->flags with wq->mutex

We're expanding wq->mutex to cover all fields specific to each
workqueue with the end goal of replacing pwq_lock which will make
locking simpler and easier to understand.

wq->nr_drainers and ->flags are specific to each workqueue.  Protect
->nr_drainers and ->flags with wq->mutex instead of pool_mutex.

tj: Rebased on top of the current dev branch.  Updated description.
