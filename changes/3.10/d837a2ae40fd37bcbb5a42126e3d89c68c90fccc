mwifiex: fix use-after-free in beacon_ie processing

beacon_ie buffer is allocated in mwifiex_fill_new_bss_desc()
and the buffer pointer is saved in bss_desc->beacon_buf.
beacon_ie is freed before the function returns. However,
bss_desc->beacon_buf is still being accessed afterwards.

Fix it by freeing beacon_ie (bss_desc->beacon_buf) in
caller's scope.
