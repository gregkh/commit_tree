libceph: isolate message page field manipulation

Define a function ceph_msg_data_set_pages(), which more clearly
abstracts the assignment page-related fields for data in a ceph
message structure.  Use this new function in the osd client and mds
client.

Ideally, these fields would never be set more than once (with
BUG_ON() calls to guarantee that).  At the moment though the osd
client sets these every time it receives a message, and in the event
of a communication problem this can happen more than once.  (This
will be resolved shortly, but setting up these helpers first makes
it all a bit easier to work with.)

Rearrange the field order in a ceph_msg structure to group those
that are used to define the possible data payloads.

This partially resolves:
