tracing: Add snapshot feature to instances

Add the "snapshot" file to the the multi-buffer instances.

  cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/instances
  mkdir foo
  ls foo
buffer_size_kb  buffer_total_size_kb  events  free_buffer  set_event
snapshot  trace  trace_clock  trace_marker  trace_options  trace_pipe
tracing_on
  cat foo/snapshot
 # tracer: nop
 #
 #
 # * Snapshot is freed *
 #
 # Snapshot commands:
 # echo 0 > snapshot : Clears and frees snapshot buffer
 # echo 1 > snapshot : Allocates snapshot buffer, if not already allocated.
 #                      Takes a snapshot of the main buffer.
 # echo 2 > snapshot : Clears snapshot buffer (but does not allocate)
 #                      (Doesn't have to be '2' works with any number that
 #                       is not a '0' or '1')
