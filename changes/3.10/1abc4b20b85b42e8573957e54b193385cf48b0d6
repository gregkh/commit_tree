cpufreq / intel_pstate: remove idle time and duration from sample and calculations

Idle time is taken into account in the APERF/MPERF ratio calculation
there is no reason for the driver to track it seperately.  This
reduces the work in the driver and makes the code more readable.

Removal of the tracking of sample duration removes the possibility of
the divide by zero exception when the duration is sub 1us
