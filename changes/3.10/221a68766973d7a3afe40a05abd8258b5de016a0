nfsd4: don't destroy in-use clients

When a setclientid_confirm or create_session confirms a client after a
client reboot, it also destroys any previous state held by that client.

The shutdown of that previous state must be careful not to free the
client out from under threads processing other requests that refer to
the client.

This is a particular problem in the NFSv4.1 case when we hold a
reference to a session (hence a client) throughout compound processing.

The server attempts to handle this by unhashing the client at the time
it's destroyed, then delaying the final free to the end.  But this still
leaves some races in the current code.

I believe it's simpler just to fail the attempt to destroy the client by
returning NFS4ERR_DELAY.  This is a case that should never happen
anyway.
