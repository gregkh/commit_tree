powerpc/perf: Add an explict flag indicating presence of SLOT field

In perf_ip_adjust() we potentially use the MMCRA[SLOT] field to adjust
the reported IP of a sampled instruction.

Currently the logic is written so that if the backend does NOT have
the PPMU_ALT_SIPR flag set then we assume MMCRA[SLOT] exists.

However on power8 we do not want to set ALT_SIPR (it's in a third
location), and we also do not have MMCRA[SLOT].

So add a new flag which only indicates whether MMCRA[SLOT] exists.

Naively we'd set it on everything except power6/7, because they set
ALT_SIPR, and we've reversed the polarity of the flag. But it's more
complicated than that.

mpc7450 is 32-bit, and uses its own version of perf_ip_adjust()
which doesn't use MMCRA[SLOT], so it doesn't need the new flag set and
the behaviour is unchanged.

PPC970 (and I assume power4) don't have MMCRA[SLOT], so shouldn't have
the new flag set. This is a behaviour change on those cpus, though we
were probably getting lucky and the bits in question were 0.

power5 and power5+ set the new flag, behaviour unchanged.

power6 & power7 do not set the new flag, behaviour unchanged.
