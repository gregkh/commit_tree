arm: mvebu: armada-xp-{gp,openblocks-ax3-4}: specify PCIe range

The ranges DT entry needed by the PCIe controller is defined at the
SoC .dtsi level. However, some boards have a NOR flash, and to support
it, they need to override the SoC-level ranges property to add an
additional range. Since PCIe and NOR support came separately, some
boards were not properly changed to include the PCIe range in their
ranges property at the .dts level.

This commit fixes those platforms.
