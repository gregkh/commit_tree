net/mlx4: Add set VF default vlan ID and priority support

Add support to ndo_set_vf_vlan in the driver. Once this call is used the vport
is considered to be in VST mode. In this mode, the PPF driver configures
Ethernet QPs created by this VF to use this vlan id and priority. Currently
RoCE isn't supported on that mode.

The special values of VID=4095 or VID=0,UP=0 are considered as VGT.
