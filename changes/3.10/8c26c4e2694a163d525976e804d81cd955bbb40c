nilfs2: fix issue with flush kernel thread after remount in RO mode because of driver's internal error or metadata corruption

The NILFS2 driver remounts itself in RO mode in the case of discovering
metadata corruption (for example, discovering a broken bmap).  But
usually, this takes place when there have been file system operations
before remounting in RO mode.

Thereby, NILFS2 driver can be in RO mode with presence of dirty pages in
modified inodes' address spaces.  It results in flush kernel thread's
infinite trying to flush dirty pages in RO mode.  As a result, it is
possible to see such side effects as: (1) flush kernel thread occupies
50% - 99% of CPU time; (2) system can't be shutdowned without manual
power switch off.

SYMPTOMS:
(1) System log contains error message: "Remounting filesystem read-only".
(2) The flush kernel thread occupies 50% - 99% of CPU time.
(3) The system can't be shutdowned without manual power switch off.

REPRODUCTION PATH:
(1) Create volume group with name "unencrypted" by means of vgcreate utility.
(2) Run script (prepared by Anthony Doggett <Anthony2486@interfaces.org.uk>):

  ----------------[BEGIN SCRIPT]--------------------
  #!/bin/bash

  VG=unencrypted
  #apt-get install nilfs-tools darcs
  lvcreate --size 2G --name ntest $VG
  mkfs.nilfs2 -b 1024 -B 8192 /dev/mapper/$VG-ntest
  mkdir /var/tmp/n
  mkdir /var/tmp/n/ntest
  mount /dev/mapper/$VG-ntest /var/tmp/n/ntest
  mkdir /var/tmp/n/ntest/thedir
  cd /var/tmp/n/ntest/thedir
  sleep 2
  date
  darcs init
  sleep 2
  dmesg|tail -n 5
  date
  darcs whatsnew || true
  date
  sleep 2
  dmesg|tail -n 5
  ----------------[END SCRIPT]--------------------

(3) Try to shutdown the system.

REPRODUCIBILITY: 100%

FIX:

This patch implements checking mount state of NILFS2 driver in
nilfs_writepage(), nilfs_writepages() and nilfs_mdt_write_page()
methods.  If it is detected the RO mount state then all dirty pages are
simply discarded with warning messages is written in system log.
