s390/pgtable: Fix guest overindication for change bit

When doing the transition invalid->valid in the host page table for
a guest, then the guest view of C/R is in the pgste. After validation
the view is pgste OR real key. We must zero out the real key C/R to
avoid guest over-indication for change (and reference).

Touching the real key is ok also for the host: The change bit is
tracked via write protection and the reference bit is also ok
because set_pte_at was called and  the page will be touched anyway
soon. Furthermore architecture defines reference as "substantially
accurate", over- and underindication are ok.
