x86/pci/mrst: Use configuration mechanism 1 for 00:00.0, 00:02.0, 00:03.0

For real PCI devices 00:00.0, 00:02.0 and 00:03.0, there is either no
PCI shim, or no guarantee of data correctness of offset 256-4k.  So for
whatever reason, Linux kernel should not do MMCFG PCI config access to
those devices.  Instead, always use configuration mechanism 1 for those
devices.

The 00:00.0, 00:02.0 and 00:03.0 devices are built-in single-function
devices and are not PCI-PCI bridges, so this set of devices should be
complete.
