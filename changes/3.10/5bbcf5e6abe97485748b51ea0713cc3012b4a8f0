drbd: adjust upper limit for activity log extents

Now that the on-disk activity-log ring buffer size is adjustable,
the maximum active set can become larger, and is now limited by
the use of 16bit "labels".

This increases the maximum working set from 6433 to 65534 extents,
each of which covers an area of 4MiB.
Which means that if you use the maximum, you'd have to resync
more than 250 GiB after an unclean Primary shutdown.
With capable backend storage and replication links,
this is entirely feasible.
