parport_pc: disable PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO on parisc architecture

If enabled, CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO scans on PC-like hardware for
various super-io chips by accessing i/o ports in a range which will
crash any parisc hardware at once.

In addition, parisc has it's own incompatible superio chip
(CONFIG_SUPERIO), so if we disable PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO completely for
parisc we can avoid that people by accident enable the parport_pc
superio option too.
