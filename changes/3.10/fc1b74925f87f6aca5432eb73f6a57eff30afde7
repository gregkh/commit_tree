KVM: Move vm_list kvm_lock declarations out of x86

The variables vm_list and kvm_lock are common to all architectures, so
move the declarations from arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_host.h to
include/linux/kvm_host.h.

Fixes sparse warnings like these when building for arm64:

  virt/kvm/kvm_main.c: warning: symbol 'kvm_lock' was not declared. Should it be static?
  virt/kvm/kvm_main.c: warning: symbol 'vm_list' was not declared. Should it be static?
