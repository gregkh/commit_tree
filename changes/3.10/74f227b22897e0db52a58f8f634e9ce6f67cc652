powerpc: Use encode avpn where we need only avpn values

In all these cases we are doing something similar to

HPTE_V_COMPARE(hpte_v, want_v) which ignores the HPTE_V_LARGE bit

With MPSS support we would need actual page size to set HPTE_V_LARGE
bit and that won't be available in most of these cases. Since we are ignoring
HPTE_V_LARGE bit, use the  avpn value instead. There should not be any change
in behaviour after this patch.
