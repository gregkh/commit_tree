mm: cleancache: lazy initialization to allow tmem backends to build/run as modules

With the goal of allowing tmem backends (zcache, ramster, Xen tmem) to
be built/loaded as modules rather than built-in and enabled by a boot
parameter, this patch provides "lazy initialization", allowing backends
to register to cleancache even after filesystems were mounted.  Calls to
init_fs and init_shared_fs are remembered as fake poolids but no real
tmem_pools created.  On backend registration the fake poolids are mapped
to real poolids and respective tmem_pools.
