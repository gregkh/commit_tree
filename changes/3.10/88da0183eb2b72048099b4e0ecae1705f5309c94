The patch adds support for THS7353 video amplifier.
The the THS7353 amplifier is very much similar to the
existing THS7303 video amplifier driver.
This patch appropriately makes changes to the existing
ths7303 driver and adds support for the THS7353.
This patch also adds V4L2_IDENT_THS7353 for the THS7353
chip and appropriate changes to Kconfig file for building.
