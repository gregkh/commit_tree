staging: zcache: fix static variables defined in debug.h but used in mutiple C files

After commit 95bdaee214 ("zcache: Move debugfs code out of zcache-main.c file")
be merged, most of knods in zcache debugfs just export zero since these variables
are defined in debug.h but are in use in multiple C files zcache-main.c and debug.c,
in this case variables can't be treated as shared variables.
