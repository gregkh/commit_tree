clk: Fixup errorhandling for clk_set_parent

Fixup the broken feature of allowing reparent of a clk to the
orhpan list and vice verse. When operating on a single-parent
clk, the .set_parent callback for the clk hw is optional to
implement, but for a multi-parent clk it is mandatory.

Moreover improve the errorhandling by verifying the prerequisites
before triggering clk notifiers. This will prevent unnecessary
rollback with ABORT_RATE_CHANGE.
