libfcoe: Fix Conflicting FCFs issue in the fabric

When multiple FCFs in use, and first FIP Advertisement received is
with "Available for Login" i.e A bit set to 0, FCF selection will fail.
The fix is to remove the assumption in the code that first FCF is only
allowed selectable FCF.
Consider the scenario fip->fcfs contains FCF1(fabricname X, marked A=0)
FCF2(fabricname Y, marked A=1). list_first_entry(first) points to FCF1
and 1st iteration we ignore the FCF and on 2nd iteration we compare
FCF1 & FCF2 fabric name and we fails to perform FCF selection.
