xfs: add CRC checking to dir2 free blocks

This addition follows the same pattern as the dir2 block CRCs, but
with a few differences. The main difference is that the free block
header is different between the v2 and v3 formats, so an "in-core"
free block header has been added and _todisk/_from_disk functions
used to abstract the differences in structure format from the code.
This is similar to the on-disk superblock versus the in-core
superblock setup. The in-core strucutre is populated when the buffer
is read from disk, all the in memory checks and modifications are
done on the in-core version of the structure which is written back
to the buffer before the buffer is logged.
