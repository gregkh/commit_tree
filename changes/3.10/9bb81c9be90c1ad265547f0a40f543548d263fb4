rbd: move more initialization into rbd_dev_image_probe()

Move a block of initialization related to the "ceph-side" of an rbd
image out of rbd_dev_probe_finish() and into rbd_dev_image_probe().

Add appropriate error handling to clean things up in the event any
of these new functions return an error.

We know that rbd_dev_snaps_update(), rbd_dev_spec_update(), and
rbd_dev_probe_parent() all clean up after themselves before they
return an error, so no special cleanup is required except when an
earlier call succeeds.  Since rbd_dev_spec_update() only updates the
spec field (whose cleanup will be handled by dropping the last
reference to the spec) there is no cleanup action associatied with
that.
