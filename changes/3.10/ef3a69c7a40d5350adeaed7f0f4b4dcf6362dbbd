mmc: block: fix the host's claim-release in special request

For normal request mmc_blk_issue_rq is called twice with asynchronous
transfer(cur and prev). Host's claim and release can be done in each
mmc_blk_issue_rq. However, Special request is currently excluded in
asynchronous transfer. After special request is finished, if there is
no new request, mmc_release_host won't be called in mmc_blk_issue_rq.
The problem is founded during mmc_suspend.
