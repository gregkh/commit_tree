PCI: Add pcibios hooks for adding and removing PCI buses

On ACPI-based platforms, the pci_slot driver creates PCI slot devices
according to information from ACPI tables by registering an ACPI PCI
subdriver.  The ACPI PCI subdriver will only be called when creating/
destroying PCI root buses, and it won't be called when hot-plugging
P2P bridges.  It may cause stale PCI slot devices after hot-removing
a P2P bridge if that bridge has associated PCI slots.  And the acpiphp
driver has the same issue too.

This patch introduces two hook points into the PCI core, which will
be invoked when creating/destroying PCI buses for PCI host and P2P
bridges.  They could be used to setup/destroy platform dependent stuff
in a unified way, both at boot time and for PCI hotplug operations.
