MIPS: Rewrite pfn_valid to work in modules, too.

This fixes:

  MODPOST 393 modules
ERROR: "min_low_pfn" [arch/mips/kvm/kvm.ko] undefined!
make[3]: *** [__modpost] Error 1

It would have been possible to just export min_low_pfn but in the end
pfn_valid should return 1 for any pfn argument for which a struct page
exists so using min_low_pfn was wrong anyway.
