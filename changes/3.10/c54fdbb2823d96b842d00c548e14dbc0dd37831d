x86: Add cpu capability flag X86_FEATURE_NONSTOP_TSC_S3

On some new Intel Atom processors (Penwell and Cloverview), there is
a feature that the TSC won't stop in S3 state, say the TSC value
won't be reset to 0 after resume. This feature makes TSC a more reliable
clocksource and could benefit the timekeeping code during system
suspend/resume cycle, so add a flag for it.
