drbd: prepare for new striped layout of activity log

Introduce two new on-disk meta data fields: al_stripes and al_stripe_size_4k
The intended use case is activity log on RAID 0 or similar.
Logically consecutive transactions will advance their on-disk position
by al_stripe_size_4k 4kB (transaction sized) blocks.

Right now, these are still asserted to be the backward compatible
values al_stripes = 1, al_stripe_size_4k = 8 (which amounts to 32kB).

Also introduce a caching member for meta_dev_idx in the in-core
structure: even though it is initially passed in in the rcu-protected
disk_conf structure, it cannot change without a detach/attach cycle.
