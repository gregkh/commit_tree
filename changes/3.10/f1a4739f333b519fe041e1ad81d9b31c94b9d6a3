rbd: support page array image requests

This patch adds the ability to build an image request whose data
will be written from or read into memory described by a page array.
(Previously only bio lists were supported.)

Originally this was going to define a new function for this purpose
but it was largely identical to the rbd_img_request_fill_bio().  So
instead, rbd_img_request_fill_bio() has been generalized to handle
both types of image request.

For the moment we still only fill image requests with bio data.
