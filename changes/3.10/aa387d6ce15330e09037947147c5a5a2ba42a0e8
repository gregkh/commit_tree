nfsd: fix EXDEV checking in rename

We again check for the EXDEV a little later on, so the first check is
redundant.  This check is also slightly racier, since a badly timed
eviction from the export cache could leave us with the two fh_export
pointers pointing to two different cache entries which each refer to the
same underlying export.

It's better to compare vfsmounts as the later check does, but that
leaves a minor security hole in the case where the two exports refer to
two different directories especially if (for example) they have
different root-squashing options.

So, compare ex_path.dentry too.
