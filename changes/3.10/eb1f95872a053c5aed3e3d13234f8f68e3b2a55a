mfd: ab8500-debug: Add explicit dependencies

As I am working on SPARSE_IRQ a number of implicit resource
grabs in the kernel become evident. For example, some includes
like <linux/irqs.h> would implicitly include <mach/irqs.h>
and then from there <mach/db8500-regs.h>.

In many cases it is masking the fact that drivers do not
properly use resources to pass their dependencies, base
addresses etc. So write explicit #include statements with
TODO items to have this fixed the proper way to all drivers
doing this.
