s390/mm: speedup storage key initialization

Use sske with multiple block control to initialize storage keys within
a 1 MB frame at once.
It turned out that the sske with mb=1 is an order of magnitude faster
than pfmf. This is only an issue for very large systems (several 100GB)
where storage key initialization could last more than a minute.
