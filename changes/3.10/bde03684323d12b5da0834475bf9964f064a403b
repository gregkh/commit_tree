[media] em28xx: add probing procedure for OmniVision sensors

OmniVision sensors are used as well in Empiatech based cameras such as the
"SpeedLink Vicious And Devine Laplace" webcam (EM2765 + Omnivision OV2640).
With this patch applied, OminiVision sensors with 8 bit address and register
width are detected (recent models have a 16 bit address width and use different
client addresses).
The most commonly used sensors (including the ones listed by Empiatech) are
detected properly, although there is no support for them yet.
