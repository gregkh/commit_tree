x86, mtrr: Fix original mtrr range get for mtrr_cleanup

Joshua reported: Commit cd7b304dfaf1 (x86, range: fix missing merge
during add range) broke mtrr cleanup on his setup in 3.9.5.
corresponding commit in upstream is fbe06b7bae7c.

  *BAD*gran_size: 64K chunk_size: 16M num_reg: 6 lose cover RAM: -0G

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59491

So it rejects new var mtrr layout.

It turns out we have some problem with initial mtrr range retrieval.
The current sequence is:
	x86_get_mtrr_mem_range
		==> bunchs of add_range_with_merge
		==> bunchs of subract_range
		==> clean_sort_range
	add_range_with_merge for [0,1M)
	sort_range()

add_range_with_merge could have blank slots, so we can not just
sort only, that will have final result have extra blank slot in head.

So move that calling add_range_with_merge for [0,1M), with that we
could avoid extra clean_sort_range calling.
