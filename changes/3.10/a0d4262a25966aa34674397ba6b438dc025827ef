pinctrl: s3c64xx: Fix build error caused by undefined chained_irq_enter

Commit de88cbb7 moved definitions of chained_irq_enter and
chained_irq_exit to a generic header, which must be now included instead
of the legacy arch-specific one.

This patch fixes build error caused by including the legacy header
leading to undefined chained_irq_enter and chained_irq_exit symbols.
