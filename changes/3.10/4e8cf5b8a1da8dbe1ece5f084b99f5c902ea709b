net/mlx4_core: Add missing report on VST and spoof-checking dev caps

Commits e6b6a23 "net/mlx4: Add VF MAC spoof checking support" and
3f7fb021 "net/mlx4: Add set VF default vlan ID and priority support"
missed reporting in the device capabilities dump when these features
are actually supported. Also two too noisy debug messages which produce
message on every QP opened by a VF, were left in the code, fix that.
