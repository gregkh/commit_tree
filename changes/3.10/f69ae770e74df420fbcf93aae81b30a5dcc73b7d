batman-adv: Avoid double freeing of bat_counters

On errors in batadv_mesh_init(), bat_counters will be freed in both
batadv_mesh_free() and batadv_softif_init_late(). This patch fixes this
by returning earlier from batadv_softif_init_late() in case of errors in
batadv_mesh_init() and by setting bat_counters to NULL after freeing.
