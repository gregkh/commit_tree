drm/i915: IVB/HSW have 32 fence register

Increase the number of fence registers to 32 on IVB/HSW. VLV however
only has 16 fence registers according to the docs.

Increasing the number of fences was attempted before [1], but there was
some uncertainty about the maximum CPU fence number for FBC. Since then
BSpec has been updated to state that there are in fact 32 fence registers,
and the CPU fence number field in the SNB_DPFC_CTL_SA register is 5 bits,
and the CPU fence number field in the ILK_DPFC_CONTROL register must be
zero. So now it all makes sense.

v2: Include some background information based on the previous attempt
