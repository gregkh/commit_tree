PM / Runtime: Asyncronous idle|suspend devices at system resume

Use the asyncronous runtime PM API when returning the runtime
reference for the device after the system resume is completed.

By using the asyncronous runtime PM API we don't have to wait
for each an every device to become idle|suspended. Instead we
can move on and handle the next device in queue.
