xfs: add support for large btree blocks

Add support for larger btree blocks that contains a CRC32C checksum,
a filesystem uuid and block number for detecting filesystem
consistency and out of place writes.

[dchinner@redhat.com] Also include an owner field to allow reverse
mappings to be implemented for improved repairability and a LSN
field to so that log recovery can easily determine the last
modification that made it to disk for each buffer.

[dchinner@redhat.com] Add buffer log format flags to indicate the
type of buffer to recovery so that we don't have to do blind magic
number tests to determine what the buffer is.

[dchinner@redhat.com] Modified to fit into the verifier structure.
