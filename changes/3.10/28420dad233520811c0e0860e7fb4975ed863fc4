fuse: fix readdirplus Oops in fuse_dentry_revalidate

Fix bug introduced by commit 4582a4ab2a "FUSE: Adapt readdirplus to application
usage patterns".

We need to check for a positive dentry; negative dentries are not added by
readdirplus.  Secondly we need to advise the use of readdirplus on the *parent*,
otherwise the whole thing is useless.  Thirdly all this is only relevant if
"readdirplus_auto" mode is selected by the filesystem.

We advise the use of readdirplus only if the dentry was still valid.  If we had
to redo the lookup then there was no use in doing the -plus version.
