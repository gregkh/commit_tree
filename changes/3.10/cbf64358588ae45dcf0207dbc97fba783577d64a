KVM: x86: Increase the "hard" max VCPU limit

KVM guests today use 8bit APIC ids allowing for 256 ID's. Reserving one
ID for Broadcast interrupts should leave 255 ID's. In case of KVM there
is no need for reserving another ID for IO-APIC so the hard max limit for
VCPUS can be increased from 254 to 255. (This was confirmed by Gleb Natapov
