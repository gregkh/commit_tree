workqueue: introduce workqueue_attrs

Introduce struct workqueue_attrs which carries worker attributes -
currently the nice level and allowed cpumask along with helper
routines alloc_workqueue_attrs() and free_workqueue_attrs().

Each worker_pool now carries ->attrs describing the attributes of its
workers.  All functions dealing with cpumask and nice level of workers
are updated to follow worker_pool->attrs instead of determining them
from other characteristics of the worker_pool, and init_workqueues()
is updated to set worker_pool->attrs appropriately for all standard
pools.

Note that create_worker() is updated to always perform set_user_nice()
and use set_cpus_allowed_ptr() combined with manual assertion of
PF_THREAD_BOUND instead of kthread_bind().  This simplifies handling
random attributes without affecting the outcome.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.

v2: Missing cpumask_var_t definition caused build failure on some
    archs.  linux/cpumask.h included.
