[media] media: davinci: kconfig: fix incorrect selects

drivers/media/platform/davinci/Kconfig uses selects where
it should be using 'depends on'. This results in warnings of
the following sort when doing randconfig builds.
warning: (VIDEO_DM6446_CCDC && VIDEO_DM355_CCDC && VIDEO_ISIF && VIDEO_DAVINCI_VPBE_DISPLAY) selects VIDEO_VPSS_SYSTEM which has unmet direct dependencies (MEDIA_SUPPORT && V4L_PLATFORM_DRIVERS && ARCH_DAVINCI)
The VPIF kconfigs had a strange 'select' and 'depends on' cross
linkage which have been fixed as well by removing unneeded
VIDEO_DAVINCI_VPIF config symbol.
Similarly, remove the unnecessary VIDEO_VPSS_SYSTEM and
VIDEO_VPFE_CAPTURE. They don't select any independent functionality
and were being used to manage code dependencies which can
be handled using makefile.
Selecting video modules is now dependent on all ARCH_DAVINCI
instead of specific EVMs and SoCs earlier. This should help build
coverage. Remove unnecessary 'default y' for some config symbols.
While at it, fix the Kconfig help text to make it more readable
and fix names of modules created during module build.
Rename VIDEO_ISIF to VIDEO_DM365_ISIF as per suggestion from
Prabhakar.
This patch has only been build tested; I have tried to not break
any existing assumptions. I do not have the setup to test video,
so any test reports welcome.
