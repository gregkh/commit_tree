ARM: dts: Add cpufreq controller node for Exynos5440 SoC

Add cpufreq controller device node for Exynos5440 SoC for passing
parameters like controller base address, interrupt and cpufreq
table. This node is added outside cpu0 as this driver is now a platform
driver and a new device structure is needed.
