Input: sysrq - supplement reset sequence with timeout functionality

Some devices have too few buttons, which it makes it hard to have
a reset combo that won't trigger automatically.  As such a
timeout functionality that requires the combination to be held for
a given amount of time before triggering is introduced.

If a key combo is recognized and held for a 'timeout' amount of time,
the system triggers a reset.  If the timeout value is omitted the
driver simply ignores the functionality.
