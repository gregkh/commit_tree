ALSA: usb-audio: Trust fields given in the quirk

The maxpacksize field is given in some quirks, but it gets ignored (in
favour of wMaxPacketSize from the first endpoint.) This patch favours
the one in the quirk.

Digidesign Mbox and Mbox 2 are the only affected quirks and the devices
are assumed to be working without this patch. So for safety against the
values in the quirk being incorrect, remove them.

The datainterval is also ignored but there are not currently any quirks
which choose to override this.
