drbd: fix for deadlock when using automatic split-brain-recovery

With an automatic after split-brain recovery policy of
"after-sb-1pri call-pri-lost-after-sb",
when trying to drbd_set_role() to R_SECONDARY,
we run into a deadlock.

This was first recognized and supposedly fixed by
2009-06-10 "Fixed a deadlock when using automatic split brain recovery when both nodes are"
replacing drbd_set_role() with drbd_change_state() in that code-path,
but the first hunk of that patch forgets to remove the drbd_set_role().

We apparently only ever tested the "two primaries" case.
