staging: comedi: s626: remove WR7146 and SETVECT macros

The WR7146 macro relies on a local variable having a specific name.
This macro is a wrapper around a writel() call. Remove the macro and
just call writel() directly.

The SETVEC macro uses the WR7146 macro so remove it as well and just
do the writel() directly.
