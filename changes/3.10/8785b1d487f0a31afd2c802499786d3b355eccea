rbd: don't release write request until necessary

Previously when a layered write was going to involve a copyup
request, the original osd request was released before submitting the
parent full-object read.  The osd request for the copyup would then
be allocated in rbd_img_obj_parent_read_full_callback().

Shortly we will be handling the event of mapped layered images
getting flattened, and when that occurs we need to resubmit the
original request.  We therefore don't want to release the osd
request until we really konw we're going to replace it--in the
callback function.
