SUNRPC: Refactor gssx_dec_option_array() to kill uninitialized warning

net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_rpc_xdr.c: In function ‘gssx_dec_option_array’:
net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_rpc_xdr.c:258: warning: ‘creds’ may be used uninitialized in this function

Return early if count is zero, to make it clearer to the compiler (and the
casual reviewer) that no more processing is done.
