workqueue: rename wq_mutex to wq_pool_mutex

wq->flush_mutex will be renamed to wq->mutex and cover all fields
specific to each workqueue and eventually replace pwq_lock, which will
make locking simpler and easier to understand.

Rename wq_mutex to wq_pool_mutex to avoid confusion with wq->mutex.
After the scheduled changes, wq_pool_mutex won't be protecting
anything specific to each workqueue instance anyway.

This patch is pure rename.

tj: s/wqs_mutex/wq_pool_mutex/.  Rewrote description.
