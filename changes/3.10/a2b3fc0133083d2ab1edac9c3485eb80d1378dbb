drm/i915: Correct sandybrige overclocking

Change the gen6+ max delay if the pcode read was successful (not the
inverse).

The previous code was all sorts of wrong and has existed since I broke
it:

    drm/i915: Extract PCU communication

I added some parentheses for clarity, and I also corrected the debug
message message to use the mask (wrong before I came along) and added a
print to show the value we're changing from.

Looking over the code, I'm not actually sure what we're trying to do. I
introduced the bug simply by extracting the function not implementing
anything new. We already set max_delay based on the capabilities
register (which is what we use elsewhere to determine min and max).
This would potentially increase it, I suppose? Jesse, I can't find the
document which explains the definitions of the pcode commands, maybe you
have it around.

Based on Jesse's response, this could potentially be for -fixes, or
stable, or maybe lead to us dropping it entirely. As the current code is
is, things won't completely break because of the aforementioned
capabilities register, and in my experimentation, enabling this has no
effect, it goes from 1100->1100.

I found this while reviewing Jesse's VLV patches.
