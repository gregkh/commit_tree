staging: comedi: amplc_pc263: split out PCI support

The "amplc_pc263" module is a hybrid driver for Amplicon PC263 (ISA) and
PCI263 (PCI) and uses conditional compilation (and compiler
optimization) to compile in the support for the different bus types.

Split out support for the PCI263 into a new module "amplc_pci263",
retaining support for the PC263 in the existing module "amplc_pc263".

Don't bother supporting the legacy attach mechanism for PCI board in the
new module as that is no longer in vogue for the comedi drivers and the
PCI263 board has no special configuration requirements.

Although the code to handle the single subdevice of each board is the
same for both drivers, this is only a small amount of code and I don't
think it's worth creating a common module to handle it.
