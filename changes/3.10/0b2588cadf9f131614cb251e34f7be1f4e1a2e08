TTY: fix close of uninitialised ports

Make sure we do not make tty-driver callbacks or wait for port to drain
on uninitialised ports (e.g. when open failed) in
tty_port_close_start().

No callback, such as flush_buffer or wait_until_sent, needs to be made
on a port that has never been opened. Neither does it make much sense to
add drain delay for an uninitialised port.

Currently a drain delay of up to two seconds could be added when a tty
fails to open.
