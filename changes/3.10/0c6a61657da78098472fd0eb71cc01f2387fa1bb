Input: trackpoint - Optimize trackpoint init to use power-on reset

The trackpoint driver sets various parameter default values, all of
which happen to be power-on defaults (Source: IBM TrackPoint Engineering
Specification, Version 4.0. Also confirmed by empirical data).

By sending the power-on reset command to reset all parameters to
power-on state, we can skip the lengthy process of programming all
parameters. In testing, ~2.5 secs of time writing parameters was reduced
to .35 seconds waiting for power-on reset to complete.
