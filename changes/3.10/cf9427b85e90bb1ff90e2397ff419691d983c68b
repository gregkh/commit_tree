powerpc: New hugepage directory format

Change the hugepage directory format so that we can have leaf ptes directly
at page directory avoiding the allocation of hugepage directory.

With the new table format we have 3 cases for pgds and pmds:
(1) invalid (all zeroes)
(2) pointer to next table, as normal; bottom 6 bits == 0
(4) hugepd pointer, bottom two bits == 00, next 4 bits indicate size of table

Instead of storing shift value in hugepd pointer we use mmu_psize_def index
so that we can fit all the supported hugepage size in 4 bits
