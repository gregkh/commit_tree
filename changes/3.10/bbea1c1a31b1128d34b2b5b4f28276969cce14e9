rbd: re-submit write request for flattened clone

Add code to rbd_img_parent_read_full_callback() to detect when a
clone's parent image has disappeared, and re-submit the original
write request in that case.  (See the previous commit for more
reasoning about why this is appropriate.)

Rename some variables in rbd_img_obj_parent_read_full_callback()
to match the convention used in the previous patch.
