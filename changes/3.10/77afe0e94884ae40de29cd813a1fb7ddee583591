ALSA: hda - Allow setting automute/automic hooks after parsing

Some codec drivers (VIA codecs and some Realtek fixups) set the
automute and automic hooks after calling
snd_hda_gen_parse_auto_config().  In the current code, the hook
pointers are referred only in snd_hda_gen_parse_auto_config() and
passed to snd_hda_jack_detect_enable_callback(), thus changing the
hook values won't change the actually called callbacks properly.

This patch fixes this bug by setting the static functions as the
primary callback functions for the jack detection, and let them
calling the appropriate hooks dynamically.
