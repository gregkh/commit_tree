KVM: Move kvm_rebooting declaration out of x86

The variable kvm_rebooting is a common kvm variable, so move its
declaration from arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_host.h to
include/asm/kvm_host.h.

Fixes this sparse warning when building on arm64:

  virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:warning: symbol 'kvm_rebooting' was not declared. Should it be static?
