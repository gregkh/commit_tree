vringh: host-side implementation of virtio rings.

Getting use of virtio rings correct is tricky, and a recent patch saw
an implementation of in-kernel rings (as separate from userspace).

This abstracts the business of dealing with the virtio ring layout
from the access (userspace or direct); to do this, we use function
pointers, which gcc inlines correctly.
