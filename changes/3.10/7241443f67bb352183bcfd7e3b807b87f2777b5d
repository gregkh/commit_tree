Input: auo_pixcir_ts - add devicetree support

Add the necessary code to create the needed platformdata from devicetree
informations.

The interrupt mode of the chip is not set via devicetree, as it is not
a property of the hardware but instead only a preferred type of operation.
This should probably be made settable via configfs in the future.
The option set as default is the mode the datasheet mentions as default.
