powerpc/pci: Fix boot panic on mpc83xx (regression)

The following commit caused a fatal oops when booting on mpc83xx with
a non-express PCI bus (regardless of whether a PCI device is present):

    powerpc/fsl-pci Make PCIe hotplug work with Freescale PCIe controllers

    Up to now the PCIe link status on Freescale PCIe controllers was only
    checked once at boot time. So hotplug did not work. With this patch the
    link status is checked on every config read. PCIe devices not present at
    boot time are found after doing 'echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/rescan'.

This patch fixes the issue by calling setup_indirect_pci for all device types.
fsl_indirect_read_config is now only used for booke/86xx PCIe controllers.
