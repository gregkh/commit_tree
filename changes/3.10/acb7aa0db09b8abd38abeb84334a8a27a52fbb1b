NVMe: Use round_jiffies_relative() for the periodic, once-per-second timer

The nvme driver has a "once per second" event where the management kthread
wakes up the system and then reschedules itself for 1 second later.
For power efficiency reasons, I'd like this timer to happen together
with other wakeups in the system.

This patch makes the schedule_timeout() call in the kthread use
round_jiffies_relative(), causing the wakeup to at least align with other
"once per X seconds" events in the kernel.
