ASoC: snd_soc_register_component() uses properly snd_soc_register_dai[s]()

snd_soc_register_dai()  uses fmt_single_name(), and
snd_soc_register_dais() uses fmt_multiple_name()
for dai->name which is used for name based matching.
This patch uses properly snd_soc_register_dai() it it was single driver,
and uses snd_register_dais() if it were multiple drivers.
