xen-netfront: frags -> slots in xennet_get_responses

This function is in fact counting the ring slots required for responses.
Separate the concepts of ring slots and skb frags make the code clearer, as
now netfront and netback can have different MAX_SKB_FRAGS, slot and frag are
not mapped 1:1 any more.
