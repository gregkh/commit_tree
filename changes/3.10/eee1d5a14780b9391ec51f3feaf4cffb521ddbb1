sctp: Correct type and usage of sctp_end_cksum()

Change the type of the crc32 parameter of sctp_end_cksum()
from __be32 to __u32 to reflect that fact that it is passed
to cpu_to_le32().

There are five in-tree users of sctp_end_cksum().
The following four had warnings flagged by sparse which are
no longer present with this change.

net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_proto_sctp.c:sctp_nat_csum()
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_proto_sctp.c:sctp_csum_check()
net/sctp/input.c:sctp_rcv_checksum()
net/sctp/output.c:sctp_packet_transmit()

The fifth user is net/netfilter/nf_nat_proto_sctp.c:sctp_manip_pkt().
It has been updated to pass a __u32 instead of a __be32,
the value in question was already calculated in cpu byte-order.

net/netfilter/nf_nat_proto_sctp.c:sctp_manip_pkt() has also
been updated to assign the return value of sctp_end_cksum()
directly to a variable of type __le32, matching the
type of the return value. Previously the return value
was assigned to a variable of type __be32 and then that variable
was finally assigned to another variable of type __le32.

Problems flagged by sparse.
Compile and sparse tested only.
