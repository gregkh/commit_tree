ath6kl: add an extra band check to ath6kl_wmi_beginscan_cmd()

Dan reported that smatch found a possible issue in ath6kl_wmi_beginscan_cmd()
where we might access sc->supp_rates beyond the end. It shouldn't happen as
ar->wiphy->bands always have just the first two bands set, but add an extra
check just to be sure.
