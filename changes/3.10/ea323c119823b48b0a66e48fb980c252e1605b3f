Bluetooth: Fix SCO connection reference

This patch fixes decrementing SCO connection reference right after
stablishing the SCO connection with defer setup enabled. The dump below
shows a disconnection command with handle 0, the connection is still in
BT_CONNECT2 state and there isn't a handle associated with it.
