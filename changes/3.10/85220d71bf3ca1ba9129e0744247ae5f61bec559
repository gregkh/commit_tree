mac80211: support secondary channel offset in CSA

Add support for the secondary channel offset IE in channel
switch announcements. This is necessary for proper handling
of CSA on HT access points.

For this to work it is also necessary to convert everything
here to use chandef structs instead of just channels. The
driver updates aren't really correct though. In particular,
the TI wl18xx driver update can't possibly be right since
it just ignores the new channel width for lack of firmware
API.
