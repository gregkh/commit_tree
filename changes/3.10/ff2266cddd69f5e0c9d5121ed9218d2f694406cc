net: sctp: remove sctp_ep_common struct member 'malloced'

There is actually no need to keep this member in the structure, because
after init it's always 1 anyway, thus always kfree called. This seems to
be an ancient leftover from the very initial implementation from 2.5
times. Only in case the initialization of an association fails, we leave
base.malloced as 0, but we nevertheless kfree it in the error path in
sctp_association_new().
