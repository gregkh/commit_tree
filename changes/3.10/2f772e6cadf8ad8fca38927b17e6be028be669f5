mm: break up swap_writepage() for frontswap backends

swap_writepage() is currently where frontswap hooks into the swap write
path to capture pages with the frontswap_store() function.  However, if
a frontswap backend wants to "resume" the writeback of a page to the
swap device, it can't call swap_writepage() as the page will simply
reenter the backend.

This patch separates swap_writepage() into a top and bottom half, the
bottom half named __swap_writepage() to allow a frontswap backend, like
zswap, to resume writeback beyond the frontswap_store() hook.

__add_to_swap_cache() is also made non-static so that the page for which
writeback is to be resumed can be added to the swap cache.
