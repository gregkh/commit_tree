block: add a flag to identify PM request

Add a flag REQ_PM to identify the request is PM related, such requests
will not change the device request queue's runtime status. It is
intended to be used in driver's runtime PM callback, so that driver can
perform some IO to the device there with the queue's runtime status
unaffected. e.g. in SCSI disk's runtime suspend callback, the disk will
be put into stopped power state, and this require sending a command to
the device. Such command processing should not change the disk's runtime
status.
