rbd: fetch object order before using it

rbd_dev_v2_header_onetime() fetches striping information, and
checks whether the image can be read by compariing the stripe unit
to the object size. It determines the object size by shifting
the object order, which is 0 at this point since it has not been
read yet. Move the call to get the image size and object order
before rbd_dev_v2_header_onetime() so it is set before use.
