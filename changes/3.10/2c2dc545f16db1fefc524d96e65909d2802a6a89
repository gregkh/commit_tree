ARM: dts: OMAP2+: Add SDMA controller bindings and nodes

Add SDMA controller binding for OMAP2+ devices and populate DMA client
information for SPI and MMC peripheral on OMAP3+ devices. Please note
that OMAP24xx devices do not have SPI and MMC bindings available yet and
so DMA client information is not populated.
