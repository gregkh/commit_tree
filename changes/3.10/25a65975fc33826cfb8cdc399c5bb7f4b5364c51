ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: add Thermal support on DT

76cc1887496fe80138c6b07c37d7f81e4cf27cde
(thermal: rcar: add Device Tree support)
supported rcar_thermal DT probing.

rcar thermal driver doesn't support IRQ on r8a7779 chip
since it is using old design IRQ.
R-Car/R-Mobile next generation chips are using new design IRQ,
and rcar thermal driver is supporting these.

This patch adds rcar_thermal DT support for r8a7779 without IRQ.
