i2c: Make return type of i2c_del_adapter() void

i2c_del_adapter() is usually called from a drivers remove callback. The Linux
device driver model does not allow the remove callback to fail and all resources
allocated in the probe callback need to be freed, as well as all resources which
have been provided to the rest of the kernel(for example a I2C adapter) need to
be revoked. So any function revoking such resources isn't allowed to fail
either. i2c_del_adapter() adheres to this requirement and will never fail. But
i2c_del_adapter()'s return type is int, which may cause driver authors to think
that it can fail. This led to code constructs like:

	ret = i2c_del_adapter(...);
	BUG_ON(ret);

Since i2c_del_adapter() always returns 0 the BUG_ON is never hit and essentially
becomes dead code, which means it can be removed. Making the return type of
i2c_del_adapter() void makes it explicit that the function will never fail and
should prevent constructs like the above from re-appearing in the kernel code.

All callers of i2c_del_adapter() have already been updated in a previous patch
to ignore the return value, so the conversion of the return type from int to
void can be done without causing any build failures.
