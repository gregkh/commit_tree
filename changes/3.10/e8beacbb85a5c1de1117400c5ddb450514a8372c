spi/spi-fsl-spi: Make driver usable in CPU mode outside of an FSL_SOC environment

This makes the spi-fsl-spi driver usable in CPU mode outside of an FSL_SOC and
even an powerpc environment by moving CPM mode functionality to a separate file
that is only compiled and linked in an FSL_SOC environment and adding some
ifdefs to hide types and functions or provide alternatives.

For devicetree probing a "clock-frequency" property is used for clock frequency
instead of calls to FSL_SOC-specific functions.
