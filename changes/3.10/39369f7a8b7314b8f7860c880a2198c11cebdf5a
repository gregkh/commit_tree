KVM: Make local routines static

The routines get_user_page_nowait(), kvm_io_bus_sort_cmp(), kvm_io_bus_insert_dev()
and kvm_io_bus_get_first_dev() are only referenced within kvm_main.c, so give them
static linkage.

Fixes sparse warnings like these:

  virt/kvm/kvm_main.c: warning: symbol 'get_user_page_nowait' was not declared. Should it be static?
