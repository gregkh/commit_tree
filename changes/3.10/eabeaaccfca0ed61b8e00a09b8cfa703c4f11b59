KVM: nVMX: Clean up and fix pin-based execution controls

Only interrupt and NMI exiting are mandatory for KVM to work, thus can
be exposed to the guest unconditionally, virtual NMI exiting is
optional. So we must not advertise it unless the host supports it.

Introduce the symbolic constant PIN_BASED_ALWAYSON_WITHOUT_TRUE_MSR at
this chance.
