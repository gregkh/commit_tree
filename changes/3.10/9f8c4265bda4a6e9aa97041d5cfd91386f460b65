sh_eth: fix result of sh_eth_check_reset() on timeout

When  the first loop in sh_eth_check_reset() runs to its end, 'cnt' is 0, so the
following check for 'cnt < 0' fails to catch the timeout.  Fix the  condition in
this check, so that the timeout  is actually reported.
While at it, fix the grammar in the failure message...
