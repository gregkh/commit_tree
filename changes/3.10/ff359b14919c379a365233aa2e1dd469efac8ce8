ALSA: hda - Fix 3.9 regression of EAPD init on Conexant codecs

The older Conexant codecs have up to two EAPDs and these are supposed
to be rather statically turned on.  The new generic parser code
assumes the dynamic on/off per path usage, thus it resulted in the
silent output on some machines.

This patch fixes the problem by simply assuming the static EAPD on for
such old Conexant codecs as we did until 3.8 kernel.
