staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: use the pci id_table 'driver_data'

Create an enum to the boardinfo and pass that enum in the pci_driver
id_table as the driver_data.

Change the macro used to fill in the device table from PCI_DEVICE() to
PCI_VDEVICE(). This allows passing the enum as the next field.

This allows removing the 'vendor_id' and 'device_id' data from the
boardinfo as well the search function that was used to locate the
boardinfo for the PCI device.

The pci1753 and pci1753e boards have the same vendor/device id so it
is impossible to determine which board is actually detected. The
boardinfo for the boards is quite different. Group them in the same
enum index in the boardinfo table and #if out the information with
USE_PCI1753E_BOARDINFO. Until a better solution is worked out, this
will allow the driver to be compiled to support the pci1753 (default)
or pci1752e.
