ring-buffer: Init waitqueue for blocked readers

The move of blocked readers to the ring buffer left out the
init of the wait queue that is used. Tests missed this due to running
stress tests against the buffers, which didn't allow for any
readers to end up waiting. Running a simple read and wait triggered
a bug.
