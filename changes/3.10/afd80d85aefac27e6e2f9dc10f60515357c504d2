pmu: prepare for migration support

In order to migrate the PMU state correctly, we need to restore the
values of MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS (a read-only register) and
MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_OVF_CTRL (which has side effects when written).
We also need to write the full 40-bit value of the performance counter,
which would only be possible with a v3 architectural PMU's full-width
counter MSRs.

To distinguish host-initiated writes from the guest's, pass the
full struct msr_data to kvm_pmu_set_msr.
