md/raid10: Allow skipping recovery when clean arrays are assembled

When an array is assembled incrementally with mdadm -I -R
and the array switches to "active" mode, md starts a recovery.

If the array was clean, the "fullsync" flag will be 0. Skip
the full recovery in this case, as RAID1 does (the code was
actually copied from the sync_request() method of RAID1).
