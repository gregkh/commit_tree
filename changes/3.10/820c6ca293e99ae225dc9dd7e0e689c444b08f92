cpufreq: Don't call __cpufreq_governor() for drivers without target()

Some cpufreq drivers implement their own governor and so don't need
us to call generic governors interface via __cpufreq_governor(). Few
recent commits haven't obeyed this law well and we saw some
regressions.

This patch is an attempt to fix the above issue.
