xfs: buffer type overruns blf_flags field

The buffer type passed to log recvoery in the buffer log item
overruns the blf_flags field. I had assumed that flags field was a
32 bit value, and it turns out it is a unisgned short. Therefore
having 19 flags doesn't really work.

Convert the buffer type field to numeric value, and use the top 5
bits of the flags field for it. We currently have 17 types of
buffers, so using 5 bits gives us plenty of room for expansion in
future....
