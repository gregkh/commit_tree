powerpc: Fix MAX_STACK_TRACE_ENTRIES too low warning again

Saw this warning again, and this time from the ret_from_fork path.

It seems we could clear the back chain earlier in copy_thread(), which
could cover both path, and also fix potential lockdep usage in
schedule_tail(), or exception occurred before we clear the back chain.
