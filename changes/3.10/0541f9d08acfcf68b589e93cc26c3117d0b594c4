rtl8192u: Don't use create_proc_read_entry()

Don't use create_proc_read_entry() as that is deprecated, but rather use
proc_create_data() and seq_file instead.  Whilst we're at it, reduce the
number of show functions where we can share them.

Note: proc_get_stats_ap() should probably use seq_file iteration rather than
list_for_each_entry().

Further note: There appears to be a lot of locking missing in this file to
defend against concurrent access by the driver doing normal operations.
Notably, ieee->network_list traversal and RWCAM/RCAMO command/response access.
Further, do any of the registers read have side effects upon reading?
