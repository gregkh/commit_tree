openvswitch: Refine Netlink message size calculation and kill FLOW_BUFSIZE

Kills the FLOW_BUFSIZE constant which needs to be calculated manually
and replaces it with key_attr_size() based on nla_total_size().
Calculates the size of datapath messages instead of relying on
NLMSG_DEFAULT_SIZE and moves the existing message size calculations
into own functions for clarity.
