powerpc: Exception hooks for context tracking subsystem

This is the exception hooks for context tracking subsystem, including
data access, program check, single step, instruction breakpoint, machine check,
alignment, fp unavailable, altivec assist, unknown exception, whose handlers
might use RCU.

This patch corresponds to
[PATCH] x86: Exception hooks for userspace RCU extended QS
  commit 6ba3c97a38803883c2eee489505796cb0a727122

But after the exception handling moved to generic code, and some changes in
following two commits:
56dd9470d7c8734f055da2a6bac553caf4a468eb
  context_tracking: Move exception handling to generic code
6c1e0256fad84a843d915414e4b5973b7443d48d
  context_tracking: Restore correct previous context state on exception exit

it is able for exception hooks to use the generic code above instead of a
redundant arch implementation.
