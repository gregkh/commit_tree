drm/tilcd: select BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT

The dependecies for BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE are defined a bit
strange, but it seems one has to always select both BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
and BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT to avoid this error:

drivers/gpu/drm/tilcdc/tilcdc_panel.c:396:
 undefined reference to `of_find_backlight_by_node'
