drm/i915: Add Reenable Timer to turn Hotplug Detection back on (v4)

We disable hoptplug detection when we encounter a hotplug event
storm. Still hotplug detection is required on some outputs (like
Display Port). The interrupt storm may be only temporary (on certain
Dell Laptops for instance it happens at certain charging states of
the system). Thus we enable it after a certain grace period (2 minutes).
Should the interrupt storm persist it will be detected immediately
and it will be disabled again.

v2: Reordered drm_i915_private: moved hotplug_reenable_timer to hpd state tracker.
v3: Clarified loop start value,
    Removed superfluous test for Ivybridge and Haswell,
    Restructured loop to avoid deep nesting (all suggested by Ville Syrjälä)
v4: Fixed two bugs pointed out by Jani Nikula.
