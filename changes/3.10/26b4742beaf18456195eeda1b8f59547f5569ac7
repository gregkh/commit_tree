ixgbe: fix register access during ethtool loopback test

This patch cleans up the logic in ixgbe_setup_loopback_test() to only access
registers applicable to the MAC type. AUTOC is only valid on MACs older than
X540. MACC is used for X540.

In addition it removes a read of AUTOC and uses the stored value to force the
link up.
