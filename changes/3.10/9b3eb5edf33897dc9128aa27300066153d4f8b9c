gre: Fix GREv4 TCPv6 segmentation.

For ipv6 traffic, GRE can generate packet with strange GSO
bits, e.g. ipv4 packet with SKB_GSO_TCPV6 flag set.  Therefore
following patch relaxes check in inet gso handler to allow
such packet for segmentation.
This patch also fixes wrong skb->protocol set that was done in
gre_gso_segment() handler.
