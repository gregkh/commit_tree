klist: del waiter from klist_remove_waiters before wakeup waitting process

There is a race between klist_remove and klist_release. klist_remove
uses a local var waiter saved on stack. When klist_release calls
wake_up_process(waiter->process) to wake up the waiter, waiter might run
immediately and reuse the stack. Then, klist_release calls
list_del(&waiter->list) to change previous
wait data and cause prior waiter thread corrupt.

The patch fixes it against kernel 3.9.
