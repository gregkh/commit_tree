i2c: Ignore return value of i2c_del_adapter()

i2c_del_adapter() always returns 0. So all checks testing whether it will be
non zero will always evaluate to false and the conditional code is dead code.
This patch updates all callers of i2c_del_mux_adapter() to ignore the return
value and assume that it will always succeed (which it will). In a subsequent
patch the return type of i2c_del_adapter() will be made void.
