netfilter: xt_TCPOPTSTRIP: fix possible mangling beyond packet boundary

This target assumes that tcph->doff is well-formed, that may be well
not the case. Add extra sanity checkings to avoid possible crash due
to read/write out of the real packet boundary. After this patch, the
default action on malformed TCP packets is to drop them. Moreover,
fragments are skipped.
