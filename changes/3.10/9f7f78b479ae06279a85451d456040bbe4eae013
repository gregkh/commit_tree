mac802154: Keep track of the channel when changed

Two sections checked whether the current channel != the new channel
without ever setting the current channel variables.

1. net/mac802154/tx.c: Prevent set_channel() from getting called every
time a packet is sent.

2. net/mac802154/mib.c: Lock (pib_lock) accesses to current_channel and
current_page and make sure they are updated when the channel has been
changed.
