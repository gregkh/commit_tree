drm/i915: (re)init HPD interrupt storm statistics

When an encoder is shared on several connectors there is only
one hotplug line, thus this line needs to be shared among these
connectors.
If HPD detect only works reliably on a subset of those connectors,
we want to poll the others. Thus we need to make sure that storm
detection doesn't mess up the settings for those connectors.
Therefore we store the settings in the intel_connector struct and
restore them from there.
If nothing is set but the encoder has a hpd_pin set we assume this
connector is hotplug capable.
On init/reset we make sure the polled state of the connectors
is (re)set to the default value, the HPD interrupts are marked
enabled.
