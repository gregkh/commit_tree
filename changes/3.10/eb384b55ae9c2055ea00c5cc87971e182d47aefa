Btrfs: fix extent logging with O_DIRECT into prealloc

This is the same as the fix from commit

Btrfs: fix bad extent logging

but for O_DIRECT.  I missed this when I fixed the problem originally, we were
still using the em for the orig_start and orig_block_len, which would be the
merged extent.  We need to use the actual extent from the on disk file extent
item, which we have to lookup to make sure it's ok to nocow anyway so just pass
in some pointers to hold this info.  Thanks,
