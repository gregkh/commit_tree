drm/gma500: Fix hibernation problems on sdvo encoders

The bug is triggered when we do a mode set on a sdvo encoder with all
connectors in the disconnected state. A crtc is considered enabled by
drm even though all of its connectors are disconnected. Work around
this by adding a check in our sdvo restore function.

Also remove the unneeded dpms on. Prepare and Commit will take care of
that.
