Staging: bcm: potential forever loop verifying firmware

There is an ioctl() to write data to the firmware.  After the data
is written, it reads the databack from the firmware and compares
against what the user wanted to write and prints an error message
if it doesn't match.

The problem is that verify process has a forever loop if the
firmware size is not a multiple of 4.  I've fixed it by replacing
the bcm compare function with memcmp().

I have chopped out some debugging code in the process.
