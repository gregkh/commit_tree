[media] em28xx: tuner setup is broken after algo_data change

Commit aab3125c43d8fecc7134e5f1e729fabf4dd196da broke em28xx. I traced
this eventually to the change in what algo_data points to. This pointer
is also passed to em28xx_tuner_callback() through several hidden tuner
layers (yuck!) and that callback was not updated.
