mm: replace hardcoded 3% with admin_reserve_pages knob

Add an admin_reserve_kbytes knob to allow admins to change the hardcoded
memory reserve to something other than 3%, which may be multiple
gigabytes on large memory systems.  Only about 8MB is necessary to
enable recovery in the default mode, and only a few hundred MB are
required even when overcommit is disabled.

This affects OVERCOMMIT_GUESS and OVERCOMMIT_NEVER.

admin_reserve_kbytes is initialized to min(3% free pages, 8MB)

I arrived at 8MB by summing the RSS of sshd or login, bash, and top.

Please see first patch in this series for full background, motivation,
testing, and full changelog.
