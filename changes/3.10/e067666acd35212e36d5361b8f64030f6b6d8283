staging: comedi: amplc_dio200: remove dio200_report_attach()

`dio200_report_attach()` is called from `dio200_common_attach()` to
report the successful attachment of a supported board.  It includes
various information about the board.  Replace the function with a simple
acknowledgement that the attachment completed successfully.  The
`dio200_attach()` and `dio200_auto_attach()` functions also output an
message during the attachment.  Include extra information in those
messages to compensate for the removal of the information output by
`dio200_report_attach()`.
