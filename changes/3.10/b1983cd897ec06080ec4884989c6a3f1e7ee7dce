create_mnt_ns: unidiomatic use of list_add()

while list_add(A, B) and list_add(B, A) are equivalent when both A and B
are guaranteed to be empty, the usual idiom is list_add(what, where),
not the other way round...  Not a bug per se, but only by accident and
it makes RTFS harder for no good reason.
