Revert "ACPI / scan: do not match drivers against objects having scan handlers"

Commit 9f29ab11ddbf ("ACPI / scan: do not match drivers against objects
having scan handlers") introduced a boot regression on Tony's ia64 HP
rx2600.  Tony says:

  "It panics with the message:

   Kernel panic - not syncing: Unable to find SBA IOMMU: Try a generic or DIG kernel

   [...] my problem comes from arch/ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c
   where the code in sba_init() says:

        acpi_bus_register_driver(&acpi_sba_ioc_driver);
        if (!ioc_list) {

   but because of this change we never managed to call ioc_init()
   so ioc_list doesn't get set up, and we die."

Revert it to avoid this breakage and we'll fix the problem it attempted
to address later.
