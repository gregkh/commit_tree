sparc32, leon: Remove separate "ticker" timer for SMP

This reduces the need from two timers to one timer.

Moreover, without this patch, when the "ticker" timer triggers timer_cs_read via
tick_periodic it reads the value of the usual timer it can get an wrapped timer
value without timer_cs_internal_counter having been updated leading to the clock
going backwards. This effectively hangs one cpu that gets stuck in
update_wall_time with an offset slightly smaller than 0xffffffffffffffff.
