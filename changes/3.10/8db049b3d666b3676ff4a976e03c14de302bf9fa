kernel/pid.c: improve flow of a loop inside alloc_pidmap.

find_next_offset() searches for an available "cleaned bit" in the
respective pid bitmap (page), so returns the offset if found, otherwise
it returns a value equals to BITS_PER_PAGE.

For example, suppose find_next_offset didn't find any available bit, so
there's no purpose to call mk_pid (Wasteful Cpu Cycles).

Therefore, I found it could be better to call mk_pid after the checking
(offset < BITS_PER_PAGE) returned sucessfully! Another point: If (offset
< BITS_PER_PAGE) results in a "failure", then mk_pid would be called
again afterwards.
