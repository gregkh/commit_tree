tracing: Add config option to allow snapshot to swap per cpu

When the preempt or irq latency tracers are enabled, they require
the ring buffer to be able to swap the per cpu sub buffers between
two main buffers. This adds a slight overhead to tracing as the
trace recording needs to perform some checks to synchronize
between recording and swaps that might be happening on other CPUs.

The config RING_BUFFER_ALLOW_SWAP is set when a user of the ring
buffer needs the "swap cpu" feature, otherwise the extra checks
are not implemented and removed from the tracing overhead.

The snapshot feature will swap per CPU if the RING_BUFFER_ALLOW_SWAP
config is set. But that only gets set by things like OPROFILE
and the irqs and preempt latency tracers.

This config is added to let the user decide to include this feature
with the snapshot agnostic from whether or not another user of
the ring buffer sets this config.
