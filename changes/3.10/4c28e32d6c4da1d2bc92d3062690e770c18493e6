ALSA: compress_core: Update calc_avail to use cumulative values

The app_pointer is managed locally by the compress core for memory
mapped DSPs but for DSPs that are not memory mapped this would have to
be manually updated from within the DSP driver itself, which is hardly
very idiomatic.

This patch switches to using the cumulative values to calculate the
available buffer space because these are already gracefully passed out
of the DSP driver to the compress core and otherwise should be
functionally equivalent.
