ASoC: ux500_pcm: Use the same snd_pcm_hardware for playback and capture

The snd_pcm_hardware structs for playback and capture in the ux500 PCM are
identical, so remove one of them and use the same snd_pcm_hardware struct for
both playback and capture. Also move the defines used to initialize the
snd_pcm_hardware fields from ux500_pcm.h to ux500_pcm.c since that's the only
place where they are used.

Also drop the assignment of the snd_pcm_hardware struct to runtime->hw since
that is what the call to snd_soc_set_runtime_hwparams() right above it already
does, so the second assignment is redundant.
