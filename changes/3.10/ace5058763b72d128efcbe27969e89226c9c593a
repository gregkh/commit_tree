KVM: s390: fix psw conversion in lpsw handler

When converting a 64 bit psw to a 128 bit psw the addressing mode bit of
the "addr" part of the 64 bit psw must be moved to the basic addressing
mode bit of the "mask" part of the 128 bit psw.
In addition the addressing mode bit must be cleared when moved to the "addr"
part of the 128 bit psw.
Otherwise an invalid psw would be generated if the orginal psw was in the
31 bit addressing mode.
