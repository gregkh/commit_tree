ACPI / PM: Allow device power states to be used for CONFIG_PM unset

Currently, drivers/acpi/device_pm.c depends on CONFIG_PM and all of
the functions defined in there are replaced with static inline stubs
if that option is unset.  However, CONFIG_PM means, roughly, "runtime
PM or suspend/hibernation support" and some of those functions are
useful regardless of that.  For example, they are used by the ACPI
fan driver for controlling fans and acpi_device_set_power() is called
during device removal.  Moreover, device initialization may depend on
setting device power states properly.

For these reasons, make the routines manipulating ACPI device power
states defined in drivers/acpi/device_pm.c available for CONFIG_PM
unset too.
