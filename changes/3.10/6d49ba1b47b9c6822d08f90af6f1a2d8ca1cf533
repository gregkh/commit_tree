btrfs: move leak debug code to functions

Clean up the leak debugging in extent_io.c by moving
the debug code into functions.  This also removes the
list_heads used for debugging from the extent_buffer
and extent_state structures when debug is not enabled.

Since we need a global debug config to do that last
part, implement CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG to accommodate.

Thanks to Dave Sterba for the Kconfig bit.
