perf/x86/amd: Add support for AMD NB and L2I "uncore" counters

Add support for AMD Family 15h [and above] northbridge
performance counters. MSRs 0xc0010240 ~ 0xc0010247 are shared
across all cores that share a common northbridge.

Add support for AMD Family 16h L2 performance counters. MSRs
0xc0010230 ~ 0xc0010237 are shared across all cores that share a
common L2 cache.

We do not enable counter overflow interrupts. Sampling mode and
per-thread events are not supported.
