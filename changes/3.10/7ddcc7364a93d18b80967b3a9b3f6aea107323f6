drm/exynos: hdmi: move mode_fixup to drm common hdmi

Currently, mode_fixup code doesn't consider the limitations of mixer as it
is implemented inside the hdmi driver. Following fix, moves the mode_fixup
to common drm hdmi driver. To check the mode support, it calls both, mixer
and hdmi check_timing callbacks for a given resolution mode.
