ARM: shmobile: add gic_iid macro for ICCIAR / interrupt ID

R-Car H1 datasheet GIC number is indicating
GIC ICCIAR / interrupt ID number, not SPI number,
but current marzen board code is using gic_spi() with
un-understandable calculation.

This patch adds new gic_iid() macro which means
ICCIAR / interrupt ID, and used the number
currently written on datasheet.
