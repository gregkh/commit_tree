workqueue: reject adjusting max_active or applying attrs to ordered workqueues

Adjusting max_active of or applying new workqueue_attrs to an ordered
workqueue breaks its ordering guarantee.  The former is obvious.  The
latter is because applying attrs creates a new pwq (pool_workqueue)
and there is no ordering constraint between the old and new pwqs.

Make apply_workqueue_attrs() and workqueue_set_max_active() trigger
WARN_ON() if those operations are requested on an ordered workqueue
and fail / ignore respectively.
