staging: comedi: ni_labpc: only ISA boards need to request_region()

Currently this driver calls request_region() in labpc_common_attach()
which is the common attach function for the ISA, PCMCIA, and PCI
versions of the labpc board.

The PCMCIA support is handled in a separate driver, ni_labpc_cs.
That driver sets the dev->iobase after aquiring the resource and
then just passes it to labpc_common_attach() which then sets
dev->iobase again.

The PCI support, currently in this driver, calls mite_setup() to
aquire the resource and then passes it to labpc_common_attach()
to set the dev->iobase.

The ISA support, also in this driver, passes a user supplied
configuration option to labpc_common_attach() which then does
the request_region() before setting the dev->iobase.

Move the request_region() to the ISA support code in labpc_attach()
and set the dev->iobase there before calling the common attach
code.

For the PCI support, also set the dev->iobase before calling the
common code.

This allows removing the extra parameter from labpc_common_attach().
