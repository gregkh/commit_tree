ASoC: dmaengine-pcm: Make requesting the DMA channel at PCM open optional

Refactor the dmaengine PCM library to allow the DMA channel to be requested
before opening a PCM substream. snd_dmaengine_pcm_open() now expects a DMA
channel instead of a filter function and filter parameter as its parameters.
snd_dmaengine_pcm_close() is updated to not release the DMA channel. This allows
a dmaengine based PCM driver to request its channels before the substream is
opened.

The patch also introduces two new functions, snd_dmaengine_pcm_open_request_chan()
and snd_dmaengine_pcm_close_release_chan(), which have the same signature and
behaviour of the old snd_dmaengine_pcm_{open,close}() and internally use the new
variants of these functions. All users of snd_dmaengine_pcm_{open,close}() are
updated to use snd_dmaengine_pcm_open_request_chan() and
snd_dmaengine_pcm_close_release_chan().
