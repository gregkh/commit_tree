USB: fix urb-poison imbalance

The calls to usb_poison_urb and usb_unpoison_urb are expected to be
balanced. However, if an urb that has not yet been submitted is
poisoned, its reject counter will not be increased as its ep-field is
NULL. A consecutive call to unpoison will thus in fact poison the urb
as its reject counter will be decremented to a negative value,
effectively preventing the urb from being submitted.

Note that there are currently no in-kernel drivers affected by this.
