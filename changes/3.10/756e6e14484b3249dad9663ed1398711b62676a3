[media] exynos4-is: Make fimc-lite independent of the pipeline->subdevs array

Get the sensor subdev by walking media graph in both cases: when the
device is used as a subdev only and through video node. This allows
to not dereference the pipeline->subdevs[] array and makes the module
more generic and easier to re-use in other media driver.
