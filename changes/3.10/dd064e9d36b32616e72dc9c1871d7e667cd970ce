usb: chipidea: udc: move _ep_queue into an unlocked function

There is no need to call ep_queue unlocked inside the own driver. We
move its functionionality into an unlocked version.

This patch removes potential unlocked timeslots inside
isr_setup_status_phase and isr_get_status_response, in which the lock
got released just before acquired again inside usb_ep_queue.
