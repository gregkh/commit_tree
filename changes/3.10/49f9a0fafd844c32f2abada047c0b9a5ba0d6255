NFSv4.1: Enable open-by-filehandle

Sometimes, we actually _want_ to do open-by-filehandle, for instance
when recovering opens after a network partition, or when called
from nfs4_file_open.
Enable that functionality using a new capability NFS_CAP_ATOMIC_OPEN_V1,
and which is only enabled for NFSv4.1 servers that support it.
