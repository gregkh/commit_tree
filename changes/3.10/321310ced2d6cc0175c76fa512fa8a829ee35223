ipc: move sem_obtain_lock() rcu locking into the only caller

sem_obtain_lock() was another of those functions that returned with the
RCU lock held for reading in the success case.  Move the RCU locking to
the caller (semtimedop()), making it more obvious.  We already did RCU
locking elsewhere in that function.

Side note: why does semtimedop() re-do the semphore lookup after the
sleep, rather than just getting a reference to the semaphore it already
looked up originally?
