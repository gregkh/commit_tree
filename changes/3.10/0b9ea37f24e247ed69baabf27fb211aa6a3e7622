nfsd: eliminate one of the DRC cache searches

The most common case is to do a search of the cache, followed by an
insert. In the case where we have to allocate an entry off the slab,
then we end up having to redo the search, which is wasteful.

Better optimize the code for the common case by eliminating the initial
search of the cache and always preallocating an entry. In the case of a
cache hit, we'll end up just freeing that entry but that's preferable to
an extra search.
