ASoC: generic-dmaengine-pcm: use a more common dma name

The examples in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt recommends
the name for dma channel doing both RX and TX to be "rx-tx".  This
becomes a common pattern that has been adopted by platforms that
converts to generic DMA bindings.  Let's follow this common pattern in
generic-dmaengine-pcm.
