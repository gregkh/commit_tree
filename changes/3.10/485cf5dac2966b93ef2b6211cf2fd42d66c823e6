idle: Fix hlt/nohlt command-line handling in new generic idle

commit d1669912 (idle: Implement generic idle function) added a new
generic idle along with support for hlt/nohlt command line options to
override default idle loop behavior.  However, the command-line
processing is never compiled.

The command-line handling is wrapped by CONFIG_GENERIC_IDLE_POLL_SETUP
and arches that use this feature select it in their Kconfigs.
However, no Kconfig definition was created for this option, so it is
never enabled, and therefore command-line override of the idle-loop
behavior is broken after migrating to the generic idle loop.

To fix, add a Kconfig definition for GENERIC_IDLE_POLL_SETUP.

Tested on ARM (OMAP4/Panda) which enables the command-line overrides
by default.
