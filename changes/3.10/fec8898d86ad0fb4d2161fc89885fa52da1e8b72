uretprobes: Return probe exit, invoke handlers

Uretprobe handlers are invoked when the trampoline is hit, on completion
the trampoline is replaced with the saved return address and the uretprobe
instance deleted.

TODO: handle_trampoline() assumes that ->return_instances is always valid.
We should teach it to handle longjmp() which can invalidate the pending
return_instance's. This is nontrivial, we will try to do this in a separate
series.
