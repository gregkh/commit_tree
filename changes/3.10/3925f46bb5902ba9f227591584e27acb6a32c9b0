powerpc/perf: Enable branch stack sampling framework

Provides basic enablement for perf branch stack sampling framework on
POWER8 processor based platforms. Adds new BHRB related elements into
cpu_hw_event structure to represent current BHRB config, BHRB filter
configuration, manage context and to hold output BHRB buffer during
PMU interrupt before passing to the user space. This also enables
processing of BHRB data and converts them into generic perf branch
stack data format.
