hwmon: Add ST-Ericsson ABX500 hwmon driver

Each of ST-Ericsson X500 chip set series consists of both ABX500 and DBX500
chips. This is ABX500 hwmon driver, where the abx500.c is a common layer for
all ABX500s, and the ab8500.c is specific for AB8500 chip. Under this designed
structure, other chip specific files can be added simply using the same common
layer abx500.c.
