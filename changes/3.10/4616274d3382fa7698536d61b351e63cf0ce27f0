ASoC: dapm: Treat DAI widgets like AIF widgets for power

Even though they are virtual widgets DAI widgets still get counted for the
DAPM context power management so we can't just use the active state to
check if they should be powered as they may not be part of a complete path.

Instead split them into input and output widgets and do the same power
checks as we perform on AIFs.
