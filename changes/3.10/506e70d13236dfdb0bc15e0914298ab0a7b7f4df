powerpc/pmu: Fix order of interpreting BHRB target entries

The current Branch History Rolling Buffer (BHRB) code misinterprets the order
of entries in the hardware buffer.  It assumes that a branch target address
will be read _after_ its corresponding branch.  In reality the branch target
comes before (lower mfbhrb entry) it's corresponding branch.

This is a rewrite of the code to take this into account.
