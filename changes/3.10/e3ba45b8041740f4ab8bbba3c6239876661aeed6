KVM: Move kvm_spurious_fault to x86.c

The routine kvm_spurious_fault() is an x86 specific routine, so
move it from virt/kvm/kvm_main.c to arch/x86/kvm/x86.c.

Fixes this sparse warning when building on arm64:

  virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:warning: symbol 'kvm_spurious_fault' was not declared. Should it be static?
