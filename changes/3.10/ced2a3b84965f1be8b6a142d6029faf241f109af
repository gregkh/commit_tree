ARM: 7750/1: update legacy CPU ID in decompressor cache support jump table

The previous mask values for the legacy ARM CPU IDs were conflicting
with the CPU ID assignments for late-generation CPUs (like the
Qualcomm MSM/QSD or Broadcom Brahma-15 processors). This change
corrects the legacy ARM CPU ID value so that the jump table can
fall-through to the appropriate cache maintenance / MMU functions.
