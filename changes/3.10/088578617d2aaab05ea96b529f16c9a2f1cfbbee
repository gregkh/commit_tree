ALSA: snd-aoa: Add a layout entry for PowerBook6,5

Either one or a combination of commits 81e5d86
"Register i2c devices from device-tree" and 3a3dd01
"Improve detection of devices from device-tree" broke sound on
PowerBook6,5 machines.

Fix it by adding an entry to the new driver to match PowerBook6,5
machines.
