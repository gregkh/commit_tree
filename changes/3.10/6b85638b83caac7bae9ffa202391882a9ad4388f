ARM: OMAP2+: PM: Remove bogus fiq_[enable/disable] tuple

On OMAP platform, FIQ is reserved for secure environment only. If at all
the FIQ needs to be disabled, it involves going through security
API call. Hence the local_fiq_[enable/disable]() in the OMAP code is bogus.
On GP devices too, the fiq is disabled for non-secure software.

So just get rid of it.
