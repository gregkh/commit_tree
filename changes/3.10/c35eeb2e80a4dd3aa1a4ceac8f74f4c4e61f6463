OMAPDSS: DISPC: Configure doublestride for NV12 when using 2D Tiler buffers

When using a DISPC video pipeline to a fetch a NV12 buffer in a 2D container, we
need to set set a doublestride bit in the video pipe's ATTRIBUTES register. This
is needed because the stride for the UV plane(using a 16 bit Tiler container) is
double the stride for the Y plane(using a 8 bit Tiler container) for the 0 or
180 degree views. The ROW_INC register is meant for the Y plane, and the HW will
calculate the row increment needed for the UV plane by using double the stride
value based on whether this bit is set or not.

Set the bit when we are using a 2D Tiler buffer and when rotation is 0 or 180
degrees. The stride value is the same for 90 and 270 degree Tiler views, hence
the bit shouldn't be set.
