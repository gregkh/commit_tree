regulator: palmas: rename probe/remove callback functions

When palmas regulator probe creates stack dump during initialization
due to some crash, it prints the call trace as follows:
[3.166321] [<c028fa20>] (_regmap_read+0x5c/0xa8) from [<c028fab0>] (regmap_read+0x44/0x5c)
[3.174669] [<c028fab0>] (regmap_read+0x44/0x5c) from [<c023062c>] (palmas_probe+0x240/0x7d0)
[3.183193] [<c023062c>] (palmas_probe+0x240/0x7d0) from [<c0284064>] (platform_drv_probe+0x14/0x18)
[3.192322] [<c0284064>] (platform_drv_probe+0x14/0x18) from [<c0282ee4>] (driver_probe_device+0x104/0x214)
[3.202055] [<c0282ee4>] (driver_probe_device+0x104/0x214) from [<c028167c>] (bus_for_each_drv+0x5c/0x88)

The palmas_probe is current name but it helps on debugging if the
function name is more appropriate to the sub-module name.

Renaming the palmas_probe() to palmas_regulator_probe() and
palmas_remove() to palams_regulator_remove().
