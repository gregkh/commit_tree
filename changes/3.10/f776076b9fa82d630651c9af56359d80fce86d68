dmaengine: dw_dmac: simplify master selection

The patch to add the common DMA binding added a dummy dw_dma_slave
structure into the dw_dma_chan structure in order to configure the
masters correctly. It turns out that this can be simplified if we
pick the DMA masters in the dwc_alloc_chan_resources function instead
and save them in the dw_dma_chan structure directly.

This could be simplified further once all users that today use
dw_dma_slave for configuration get converted to device tree based
setup instead.
