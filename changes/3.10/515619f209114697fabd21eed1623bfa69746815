uprobes/perf: Avoid perf_trace_buf_prepare/submit if ->perf_events is empty

perf_trace_buf_prepare() + perf_trace_buf_submit() make no sense
if this task/CPU has no active counters. Change uprobe_perf_print()
to return if hlist_empty(call->perf_events).

Note: this is not uprobe-specific, we can change other users too.
