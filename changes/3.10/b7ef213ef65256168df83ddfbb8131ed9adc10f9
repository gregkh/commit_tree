ipv6: introdcue __ipv6_addr_needs_scope_id and ipv6_iface_scope_id helper functions

__ipv6_addr_needs_scope_id checks if an ipv6 address needs to supply
a 'sin6_scope_id != 0'. 'sin6_scope_id != 0' was enforced in case
of link-local addresses. To support interface-local multicast these
checks had to be enhanced and are now consolidated into these new helper
functions.

v2:
a) migrated to struct ipv6_addr_props

v3:
a) reverted changes for ipv6_addr_props
b) test for address type instead of comparing scope

v4:
a) unchanged
