e1000e: EEE capability advertisement not set/disabled as required

Devices supported by the driver which support EEE (currently 82579, I217
and I218) are advertising EEE capabilities during auto-negotiation even
when EEE has been disabled.  In addition to not acting as expected, this
also caused the EEE status reported by 'ethtool --show-eee' to be wrong
when two of these devices are connected back-to-back and EEE is disabled
on one.  In addition to fixing this issue, the ability for the user to
specify which speeds (100 or 1000 full-duplex) to advertise EEE support
has been added.
