uprobes/tracing: Make uprobe_{trace,perf}_print() uretprobe-friendly

Change uprobe_trace_print() and uprobe_perf_print() to check
is_ret_probe() and fill ring_buffer_event accordingly.

Also change uprobe_trace_func() and uprobe_perf_func() to not
_print() if is_ret_probe() is true. Note that we keep ->handler()
nontrivial even for uretprobe, we need this for filtering and for
other potential extensions.
