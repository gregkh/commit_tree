powerpc/pseries/lparcfg: Fix possible overflow are more than 1026

need set '\0' for 'local_buffer'.

SPLPAR_MAXLENGTH is 1026, RTAS_DATA_BUF_SIZE is 4096. so the contents of
rtas_data_buf may truncated in memcpy.

if contents are really truncated.
  the splpar_strlen is more than 1026. the next while loop checking will
  not find the end of buffer. that will cause memory access violation.
