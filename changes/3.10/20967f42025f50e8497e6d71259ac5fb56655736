ixgbe: Mask off check of frag_off as we only want fragment offset

We were incorrectly checking the entire frag_off field when we only wanted the
fragment offset.  As a result we were not pulling in TCP headers when the DNF
flag was set.

To correct that we will now check for frag off using the IP_OFFSET mask.
