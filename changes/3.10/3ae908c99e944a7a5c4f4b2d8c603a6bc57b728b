xtensa: provide custom CALLER_ADDR* implementations

Definition of CALLER_ADDR* through __builtin_return_address makes
compiler insert calls to __xtensa_libgcc_window_spill, which in turn
makes fast_syscall_spill_registers syscall that clobbers registers when
called from the kernel mode, leading to invalid opcode exceptions on
return to userspace.

Provide definition for CALLER_ADDR0 as MAKE_PC_FROM_RA(a0, a1) and in
case CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is enabled extract CALLER_ADDR{1-3} from
stack.
