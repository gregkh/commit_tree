staging: comedi: ni_labpc: pass the isr_flags to labpc_common_attach()

The PCI and PCMCIA LabPC boards use shared interrupts and need the
IRQF_SHARED flag set when requesting the irq, the ISA boards do not.

Instead of checking the 'bustype' in labpc_common_attach() in order
to determine the isr_flags, just pass the flags as a parameter to the
function.
