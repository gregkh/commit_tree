s390: disable pfmf for clear page instruction

Wit the introduction of large pages Linux also used pfmf for page
clearing. The current implementation is not ideal, though:
- currently we set usage intent=0, but cleared pages are often used
directly after the clearing
- z/VM does not yet provide EDAT
- KVM does have to intercept PFMF even for resident pages

Lets just the mvcl loop in all cases until we have a well defined
pattern were pfmf is besser.
