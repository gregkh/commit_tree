hp_accel: Ignore the error from lis3lv02d_poweron() at resume

The error in lis3lv02_poweron() is harmless in the resume path, so
we should ignore it. It is inline with the other usages of lis3lv02_poweron()
and matches the 3.0 code for this routine. This patch is in suse git and
might have missed making it into the mainline.
