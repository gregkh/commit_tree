params: Fix potential memory leak in add_sysfs_param()

On allocation failure, it would fail to free the old attrs array which
was no longer referenced by anything (since it would free the old
module_param_attrs struct on the way out).

Comment the suspicious-looking krealloc() usage to explain why it *isn't*
actually buggy, despite looking like a classic realloc() usage bug.
