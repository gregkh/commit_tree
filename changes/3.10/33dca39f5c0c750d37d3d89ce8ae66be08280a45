rbd: kill off the snapshot list

We no longer use the snapshot list for anything.  When we need to
look up a snapshot name, id, size, or feature mask, we just do it
directly rather than relying on this list being updated with every
refresh.  The main reason it existed was for the benefit of the
device/sysfs entries that previously were associated with snapshots.

So get rid of the snapshot list, and struct rbd_snap, and the
hundreds of lines of code that supported them.
