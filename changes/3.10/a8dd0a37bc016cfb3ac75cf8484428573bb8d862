libceph: define osd_req_opcode_valid()

Define a separate function to determine the validity of an opcode,
and use it inside osd_req_encode_op() in order to unclutter that
function.

Don't update the destination op at all--and return zero--if an
unsupported or unrecognized opcode is seen in osd_req_encode_op().
