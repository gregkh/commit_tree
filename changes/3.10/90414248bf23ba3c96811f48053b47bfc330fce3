[media] siano: fix checkpatch.pl compliants on smscoreapi.h

Fix the remaining checkpatch.pl compliants at smscoreapi.h,
except by the "line over 80 characters" on comments. Fixing those
would require more time, as the better is to convert them into the
struct descriptions used inside the kernel, as described at:
	Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt
