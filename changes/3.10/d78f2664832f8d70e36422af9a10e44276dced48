KVM: VMX: Register a new IPI for posted interrupt

Posted Interrupt feature requires a special IPI to deliver posted interrupt
to guest. And it should has a high priority so the interrupt will not be
blocked by others.
Normally, the posted interrupt will be consumed by vcpu if target vcpu is
running and transparent to OS. But in some cases, the interrupt will arrive
when target vcpu is scheduled out. And host will see it. So we need to
register a dump handler to handle it.
