i2c: core: Pick i2c bus number from dt alias if present

This allows you to get the equivalent functionality of
i2c_add_numbered_adapter() with all data in the device tree and no
special case code in your driver.  This is a common device tree
technique.

For quick reference, the FDT syntax for using an alias to provide an
ID looks like:
  aliases {
    i2c0 = &i2c_0;
    i2c1 = &i2c_1;
  };
