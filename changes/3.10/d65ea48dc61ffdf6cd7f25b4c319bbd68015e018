parisc: Use unshadowed index register for flush instructions in flush_dcache_page_asm and flush_icache_page_asm

The comment at the start of pacache.S states that the base and index
registers used for fdc,fic, and pdc instructions should not use shadowed
registers. Although this is probably unnecessary for tmpalias flushes,
there is also no reason not to comply.
