rbd: only set up watch for mapped images

Any changes to parent images are immaterial to any mapped clone.
So there is no need to have a watch event registered on header
objects except for the header object of an image that is mapped.
In fact, a watch request is a write operation, and we may only
have read access to a parent image.

We can't set up the watch request until we know the name of the
header object though.  So pass a flag to rbd_dev_image_probe() to
indicate whether this probe is for a mapping or for a parent image.

Change the second parameter to rbd_dev_header_watch_sync() be
Boolean while we're at it.

This resolves:
