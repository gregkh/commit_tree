wireless: move sequence number arithmetic to ieee80211.h

Move the sequence number arithmetic code from mac80211 to
ieee80211.h so others can use it. Also rename the functions
from _seq to _sn, they operate on the sequence number, not
the sequence_control field.

Also move macros to convert the sequence control to/from
the sequence number value from various drivers.
