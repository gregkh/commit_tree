irqdomain: Allow quiet failure mode

Some interrupt controllers refuse to map interrupts marked as
"protected" by firwmare. Since we try to map everyting in the
device-tree on some platforms, we end up with a lot of nasty
WARN's in the boot log for what is a normal situation on those
machines.

This defines a specific return code (-EPERM) from the host map()
callback which cause irqdomain to fail silently.

MPIC is updated to return this when hitting a protected source
printing only a single line message for diagnostic purposes.
