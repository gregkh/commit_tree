s390/kvm,tprot: use new gmap_translate() function

When out-of-memory the tprot code incorrectly injected a program check
for the guest which reported an addressing exception even if the guest
address was valid.
Let's use the new gmap_translate() which translates a guest address to
a user space address whithout the chance of running into an out-of-memory
situation.
Also make it more explicit that for -EFAULT we won't find a vma.
