staging: ti-soc-thermal: Modify update_interval r/w functions to incorporate the OMAP5 feature of COUNTER_DELAY.

Update ti_bandgap_write_update_interval and ti_bandgap_read_update_interval
functions to incorporate the OMAP5 feature of COUNTER_DELAY. The way we
program the delay between two successive temperature conversions
is different for OMAP5 as when compared with OMAP4. Incorporating
the changes required to program the delay for OMAP5.
