tg3: Refactor cpu pause/resume code

The 57766 rxcpu needs to be paused/resumed when we download the firmware just
like we do for existing firmware. Refactor the pause/resume code to be
reusable.

This patch also renames the "offset" argument of tg3_halt_cpu to "cpu_base"
since that's what it really is.
