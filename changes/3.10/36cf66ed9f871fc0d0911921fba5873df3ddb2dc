fuse: make fuse_direct_io() aware about AIO

The patch implements passing "struct fuse_io_priv *io" down the stack up to
fuse_send_read/write where it is used to submit request asynchronously.
io->async==0 designates synchronous processing.

Non-trivial part of the patch is changes in fuse_direct_io(): resources
like fuse requests and user pages cannot be released immediately in async
case.
