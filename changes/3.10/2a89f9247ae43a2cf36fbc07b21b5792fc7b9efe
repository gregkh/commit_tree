VSOCK: Support VM sockets connected to the hypervisor.

The resource ID used for VM socket control packets (0) is already
used for the VMCI_GET_CONTEXT_ID hypercall so a new ID (15) must be
used when the guest sends these datagrams to the hypervisor.

The hypervisor context ID must also be removed from the internal
blacklist.
