PCI/ACPI: Remove support of ACPI PCI subdrivers

Both sub-drivers of the "PCI Root Bridge ("pci_bridge")" driver, "acpiphp"
and "pci_slot", have been converted to hook directly into the PCI core.

With the conversions there are no remaining usages of the 'struct
acpi_pci_driver' list based infrastructure.  This patch removes it.
