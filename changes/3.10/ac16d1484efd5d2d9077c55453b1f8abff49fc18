batman-adv: wait for rtnl in batadv_store_mesh_iface instead of failing if it is taken

The rtnl_lock in batadv_store_mesh_iface has been converted to a rtnl_trylock
some time ago to avoid a possible deadlock between rtnl and s_active on removal
of the sysfs nodes.

The behaviour introduced by that was quite confusing as it could lead to the
sysfs store to fail, making batman-adv setup scripts unreliable. As recently the
sysfs removal was postponed to a worker not running with the rtnl taken, the
deadlock can't occur any more and it is safe to change the trylock back to a
lock to make the sysfs store reliable again.
