PCI: Remove MSI/MSI-X cap check in pci_msi_check_device()

The function pci_msi_check_device() is called while enabling MSI
or MSI-X interrupts to make sure the PCI device can support MSI
or MSI-X capability.  This patch removes the check on MSI or MSI-X
capability in the function and lets the caller do the check.
