ARM: PL011: add support for extended FIFO-size of PL011-r1p5

The latest r1p5-revision of the ARM PL011 UART has 32-byte FIFOs,
while all earlier ones have 16-byte FIFOs. This patch suggests
a way to set the FIFO-size correctly & flexibly by using a member
function named get_fifosize, rather than using the fifosize member
variable. The function takes the UARTPeriphID, and returns the
correct FIFO size.
