mmc: omap_hsmmc: Skip platform_get_resource_byname() for dt case

MMC driver probe will abort for DT case because of failed
platform_get_resource_byname() lookup. Fix it by skipping resource
lookup byname for device tree build.

Issue is hidden because hwmod populates the IO resources which
helps to succeed platform_get_resource_byname() and probe.
