cfg80211/mac80211: disconnect on suspend

If possible that after suspend, cfg80211 will receive request to
disconnect what require action on interface that was removed during
suspend.

Problem can manifest itself by various warnings similar to below one:

To fix the problem disconnect from any associated network before
suspend. User space is responsible to establish connection again
after resume. This basically need to be done by user space anyway,
because associated stations can go away during suspend (for example
NetworkManager disconnects on suspend and connect on resume by default).

Patch also handle situation when driver refuse to suspend with wowlan
configured and try to suspend again without it.
