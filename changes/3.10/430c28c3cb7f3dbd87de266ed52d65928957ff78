rbd: define rbd_osd_req_format_op()

Define rbd_osd_req_format_op(), which encapsulates formatting
an osd op into an object request's osd request message.  Only
one op is supported right now.

Stop calling ceph_osdc_build_request() in rbd_osd_req_create().
Instead, call rbd_osd_req_format_op() in each of the callers of
rbd_osd_req_create().

This is to prepare for the next patch, in which the source ops for
an osd request will be held in the osd request itself.  Because of
that, we won't have the source op to work with until after the
request is created, so we can't format the op until then.

This an the next patch resolve:
