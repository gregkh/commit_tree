rcu: Accelerate RCU callbacks at grace-period end

Now that callback acceleration is idempotent, it is safe to accelerate
callbacks during grace-period cleanup on any CPUs that the kthread happens
to be running on.  This commit therefore propagates the completion
of the grace period to the per-CPU data structures, and also adds an
rcu_advance_cbs() just before the cpu_needs_another_gp() check in order
to reduce false-positive grace periods.
