[media] cx231xx : Add support for OTG102 aka EZGrabber2

Thanks for the response, I have done as you suggested.
Below is an updated patch for the OTG102 device against http://git.linuxtv.org/hverkuil/media_tree.git/shortlog/refs/heads/cx231xx, kernel version 3.8.
With further testing it appears the extra clauses in cx231xx-cards.c were not necessary (in static in cx231xx_init_dev and static int cx231xx_usb_probe), so those have been also been removed.
