workqueue: remove unbound_std_worker_pools[] and related helpers

Workqueue no longer makes use of unbound_std_worker_pools[].  All
unbound worker_pools are created dynamically and there's nothing
special about the standard ones.  With unbound_std_worker_pools[]
unused, workqueue no longer has places where it needs to treat the
per-cpu pools-cpu and unbound pools together.

Remove unbound_std_worker_pools[] and the helpers wrapping it to
present unified per-cpu and unbound standard worker_pools.

* for_each_std_worker_pool() now only walks through per-cpu pools.

* for_each[_online]_wq_cpu() which don't have any users left are
  removed.

* std_worker_pools() and std_worker_pool_pri() are unused and removed.

* get_std_worker_pool() is removed.  Its only user -
  alloc_and_link_pwqs() - only used it for per-cpu pools anyway.  Open
  code per_cpu access in alloc_and_link_pwqs() instead.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
