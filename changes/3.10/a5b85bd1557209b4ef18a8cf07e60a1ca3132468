tracing: Don't succeed if event_enable_func did not register anything

Return 0 instead of the number of activated ftrace function probes if
event_enable_func succeeded and return an error code if it failed or
did not register any functions. But it currently returns the number
of registered functions and if it didn't register anything, it returns 0,
but that is considered success.

This also fixes the return value. As if it succeeds, it returns the
number of functions that were enabled, which is returned back to
the user in ftrace_regex_write (the write() return code). If only
one function is enabled, then the return code of the write is one,
and this can confuse the user program in thinking it only wrote 1
byte.
