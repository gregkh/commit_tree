firewire net: No need to reset dev->local_fifo after failure of fw_core_add_address_handler().

fwnet_broadcast_start() try to register address handler at first
if it was not registered yet; dev->local_fifo ==
FWNET_NO_FIFO_ADDR.

Since dev->local_info not changed if fw_core_add_address_hander()
has failed, we do not need to set dev->local_info to
FWNET_NO_FIFO_ADDR.
