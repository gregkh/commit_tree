SUNRPC: Introduce rpcauth_get_pseudoflavor()

A SECINFO reply may contain flavors whose kernel module is not
yet loaded by the client's kernel.  A new RPC client API, called
rpcauth_get_pseudoflavor(), is introduced to do proper checking
for support of a security flavor.

When this API is invoked, the RPC client now tries to load the
module for each flavor first before performing the "is this
supported?" check.  This means if a module is available on the
client, but has not been loaded yet, it will be loaded and
registered automatically when the SECINFO reply is processed.

The new API can take a full GSS tuple (OID, QoP, and service).
Previously only the OID and service were considered.

nfs_find_best_sec() is updated to verify all flavors requested in a
SECINFO reply, including AUTH_NULL and AUTH_UNIX.  Previously these
two flavors were simply assumed to be supported without consulting
the RPC client.

Note that the replaced version of nfs_find_best_sec() can return
RPC_AUTH_MAXFLAVOR if the server returns a recognized OID but an
unsupported "service" value.  nfs_find_best_sec() now returns
RPC_AUTH_UNIX in this case.
