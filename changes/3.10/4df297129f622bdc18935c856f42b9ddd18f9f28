tracing: Remove most or all of stack tracer stack size from stack_max_size

Currently, the depth reported in the stack tracer stack_trace file
does not match the stack_max_size file. This is because the stack_max_size
includes the overhead of stack tracer itself while the depth does not.

The first time a max is triggered, a calculation is not performed that
figures out the overhead of the stack tracer and subtracts it from
the stack_max_size variable. The overhead is stored and is subtracted
from the reported stack size for comparing for a new max.

Now the stack_max_size corresponds to the reported depth:

 # cat stack_max_size
4640

 # cat stack_trace
        Depth    Size   Location    (48 entries)
        -----    ----   --------
  0)     4640      32   _raw_spin_lock+0x18/0x24
  1)     4608     112   ____cache_alloc+0xb7/0x22d
  2)     4496      80   kmem_cache_alloc+0x63/0x12f
  3)     4416      16   mempool_alloc_slab+0x15/0x17
[...]

While testing against and older gcc on x86 that uses mcount instead
of fentry, I found that pasing in ip + MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE let the
stack trace show one more function deep which was missing before.
