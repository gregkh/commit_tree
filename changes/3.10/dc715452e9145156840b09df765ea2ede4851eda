spi: pl022: use generic DMA slave configuration if possible

With the new OF DMA binding, it is possible to completely avoid the
need for platform_data for configuring a DMA channel. In cases where the
platform has already been converted, calling dma_request_slave_channel
should get all the necessary information from the device tree.

Like the patch that converts the dw_dma controller, this is completely
untested and is looking for someone to try it out.
