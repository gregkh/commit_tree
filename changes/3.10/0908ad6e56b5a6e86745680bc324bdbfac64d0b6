uprobes: Add trap variant helper

Some architectures like powerpc have multiple variants of the trap
instruction. Introduce an additional helper is_trap_insn() for run-time
handling of non-uprobe traps on such architectures.

While there, change is_swbp_at_addr() to is_trap_at_addr() for reading
clarity.

With this change, the uprobe registration path will supercede any trap
instruction inserted at the requested location, while taking care of
delivering the SIGTRAP for cases where the trap notification came in
for an address without a uprobe. See [1] for a more detailed explanation.
