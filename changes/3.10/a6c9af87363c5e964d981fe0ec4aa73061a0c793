tcm_vhost: Add hotplug/hotunplug support

In commit 365a7150094 ([SCSI] virtio-scsi: hotplug support for
virtio-scsi), hotplug support is added to virtio-scsi.

This patch adds hotplug and hotunplug support to tcm_vhost.

You can create or delete a LUN in targetcli to hotplug or hotunplug a
LUN in guest.
