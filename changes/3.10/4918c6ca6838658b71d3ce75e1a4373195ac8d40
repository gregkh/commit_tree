KVM: VMX: Require KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR being called prior to running a VCPU

Very old user space (namely qemu-kvm before kvm-49) didn't set the TSS
base before running the VCPU. We always warned about this bug, but no
reports about users actually seeing this are known. Time to finally
remove the workaround that effectively prevented to call vmx_vcpu_reset
while already holding the KVM srcu lock.
