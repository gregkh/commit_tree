drm/i915: Adding more reserved PCI IDs for Haswell.

At DDX commit Chris mentioned the tendency we have of finding out more
PCI IDs only when users report. So Let's add all new reserved Haswell IDs.

This patch also fix GT3 names. I'no not sending in separated patche because
names are only in few comments and not in variable names.

v2: Fix some mobile ids (by Paulo)
