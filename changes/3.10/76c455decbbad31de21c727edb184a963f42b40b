team: check return value of team_get_port_by_index_rcu() for NULL

team_get_port_by_index_rcu() might return NULL due to race between port
removal and skb tx path. Panic is easily triggeable when txing packets
and adding/removing port in a loop.

introduced by commit 3d249d4ca "net: introduce ethernet teaming device"
and commit 753f993911b "team: introduce random mode" (for random mode)
