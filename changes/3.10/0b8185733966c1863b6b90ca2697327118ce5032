backlight: lp855x: move backlight mode platform data

The brightness of LP855x devices is controlled by I2C register or PWM
input .  This mode was selected through the platform data, but it can be
chosen by the driver internally without platform data configuration.

How to decide the control mode:
  If the PWM period has specific value, the mode is PWM input.
  On the other hand, the mode is register-based.
  This mode selection is done on the _probe().

Move 'mode' from a header file to the driver private data structure,
'lp855 x'.  And correlated code was replaced.
