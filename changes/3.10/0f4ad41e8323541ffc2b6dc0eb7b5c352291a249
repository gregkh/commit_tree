sh: sh7757: Add pin control resources

Add memory resources for the pin control platform device to let the
sh-pfc driver ioremap() registers properly instead of evily casting
register physical addresses to virtual addresses.

The memory resource address range has been extracted from the config and
data registes lists in the sh-pfc driver.
