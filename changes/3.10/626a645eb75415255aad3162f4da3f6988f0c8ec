ARM: shmobile: streamline mackerel SD and MMC devices

This patch fixes the following issues with SD and MMC interfaces on mackerel:
1. replace custom card-detection functions with standard GPIO CD API
2. resources don't have to be numbered
3. add SDHI interrupt names
4. remove OCR masks, where regulators are used
5. only specify SDHI CD interrupts on interfaces where a CD pin is present -
   SDHI0
6. don't instantiate an MMCIF device and initialise MMCIF pins if SDHI1 is
   selected
