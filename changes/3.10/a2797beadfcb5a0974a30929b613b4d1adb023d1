gpio/omap: force restore if context loss is not detectable

When booting with device-tree the function pointer for detecting context
loss is not populated. Ideally, the pm_runtime framework should be
enhanced to allow a means for reporting context/state loss and we could
avoid populating such function pointers altogether. In the interim until
a generic non-device specific solution is in place, force a restore of
the gpio bank when enabling the gpio controller.

Adds a new device-tree property for the OMAP GPIO controller to indicate
if the GPIO controller is located in a power-domain that never loses
power and hence will always maintain its logic state.
