drivers: net: cpsw: fix cpsw clock gating issue across suspend/resume

Due to some hardware integration issue, CPSW sliver modules requires a
reset across suspend/resume cycle for a successful clock gating to
CPGMAC (CPSW and Davinci MDIO) in AM335x PG1.0.
This issue is fixed in PG2.x, though to support suspend/resume on PG1.0
this reset is required.
