fs: remove dentry_lru_prune()

When pruning a dentry, its ancestor dentry can also be pruned. But
the ancestor dentry does not go through dput(), so it does not get
put on the dentry LRU. Hence associating d_prune with removing the
dentry from the LRU is the wrong.

The fix is remove dentry_lru_prune(). Call file system's d_prune()
callback directly when pruning dentries.
