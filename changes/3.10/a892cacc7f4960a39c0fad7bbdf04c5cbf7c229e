workqueue: move pwq_pool_locking outside of get/put_unbound_pool()

The scheduled NUMA affinity support for unbound workqueues would need
to walk workqueues list and pool related operations on each workqueue.

Move wq_pool_mutex locking out of get/put_unbound_pool() to their
callers so that pool operations can be performed while walking the
workqueues list, which is also protected by wq_pool_mutex.
