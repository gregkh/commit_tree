powerpc: Syscall hooks for context tracking subsystem

This is the syscall slow path hooks for context tracking subsystem,
corresponding to
[PATCH] x86: Syscall hooks for userspace RCU extended QS
  commit bf5a3c13b939813d28ce26c01425054c740d6731

TIF_MEMDIE is moved to the second 16-bits (with value 17), as it seems there
is no asm code using it. TIF_NOHZ is added to _TIF_SYCALL_T_OR_A, so it is
better for it to be in the same 16 bits with others in the group, so in the
asm code, andi. with this group could work.
