perf: Fix perf mmap bugs

Vince reported a problem found by his perf specific trinity
fuzzer.

Al noticed 2 problems with perf's mmap():

 - it has issues against fork() since we use vma->vm_mm for accounting.
 - it has an rb refcount leak on double mmap().

We fix the issues against fork() by using VM_DONTCOPY; I don't
think there's code out there that uses this; we didn't hear
about weird accounting problems/crashes. If we do need this to
work, the previously proposed VM_PINNED could make this work.

Aside from the rb reference leak spotted by Al, Vince's example
prog was indeed doing a double mmap() through the use of
perf_event_set_output().

This exposes another problem, since we now have 2 events with
one buffer, the accounting gets screwy because we account per
event. Fix this by making the buffer responsible for its own
accounting.
