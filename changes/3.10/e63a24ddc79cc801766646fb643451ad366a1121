MIPS: Alchemy: fix wait function

Only an interrupt can wake the core from 'wait', enable interrupts
locally before executing 'wait'.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: This leave the race between an interrupt that's
setting TIF_NEED_RESCHEd and entering the WAIT status. but at least it's
going to bring Alchemy back from the dead, so I'm going to apply this
patch.]
