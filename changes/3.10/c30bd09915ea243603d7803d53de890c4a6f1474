timekeeping: Avoid adjust kernel time once hwclock kept in UTC time

If the Hardware Clock kept in local time,kernel will adjust the time
to be UTC time.But if Hardware Clock kept in UTC time,system will make
a dummy settimeofday call first (sys_tz.tz_minuteswest = 0) to make sure
the time is not shifted,so at this point I think maybe it is not necessary
to set the kernel time once the sys_tz.tz_minuteswest is zero.
