ASoC: arizona: Basic support for ISRC rate selection

Since ASoC does not yet really have the framework features needed to
support propagating sample rates through the device well yet implement
basic support for the ISRCs equivalent to that we currently have for the
ASRCs. The user can opt for 8kHz or 16kHz as the rate for the DSP blocks
in addition to the main audio rate, these being the primary use cases.
