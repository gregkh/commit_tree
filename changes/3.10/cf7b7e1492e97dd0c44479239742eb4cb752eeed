ceph: use calc_pages_for() in start_read()

There's a spot that computes the number of pages to allocate for a
page-aligned length by just shifting it.  Use calc_pages_for()
instead, to be consistent with usage everywhere else.  The result
is the same.

The reason for this is to make it clearer in an upcoming patch that
this calculation is duplicated.
