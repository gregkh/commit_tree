clocksource: samsung_pwm_timer: Work around rounding errors in clockevents core

Due to rounding errors in clockevents core (in conversions between ticks
and nsecs), it might happen that the set_next_event callback gets called
with cycles = 0, causing the code to incorrectly program the PWM timer.

This patch modifies the callback to program the timer for 1 tick, if
received tick count value is 0.
