KVM: nVMX: Skip PF interception check when queuing during nested run

While a nested run is pending, vmx_queue_exception is only called to
requeue exceptions that were previously picked up via
vmx_cancel_injection. Therefore, we must not check for PF interception
by L1, possibly causing a bogus nested vmexit.
