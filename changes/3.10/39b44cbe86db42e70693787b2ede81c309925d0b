libceph: set message data when building osd request

All calls of ceph_osdc_start_request() are preceded (in the case of
rbd, almost) immediately by a call to ceph_osdc_build_request().

Move the build calls at the top of ceph_osdc_start_request() out of
there and into the ceph_osdc_build_request().  Nothing prevents
moving these calls to the top of ceph_osdc_build_request(), either
(and we're going to want them there in the next patch) so put them
at the top.

This and the next patch are related to:
