i2c: i2c_del_adapter: Don't treat removing a non-registered adapter as error

Currently i2c_del_adapter() returns -EINVAL when it gets an adapter which is not
registered. But none of the users of i2c_del_adapter() depend on this behavior,
so for the sake of being able to sanitize the return type of i2c_del_adapter
argue, that the purpose of i2c_del_adapter() is to remove an I2C adapter from
the system. If the adapter is not registered in the first place this becomes a
no-op. So we can return success without having to do anything.
