rbd: stop tracking header object version

The rbd code takes care to maintain the version of the header
object.  This was done in hopes of using it to detect a change in
the object between reading it and setting up a watch request to
be notified of changes.

The mechanism was never fully implemented, however.  And we now
avoid the original problem by setting up the watch request before
ever reading the content of the header.

The osd doesn't interpret the object version supplied with a WATCH
osd op, nor does it use the version supplied with a NOTIFY_ACK op
(we can just supply 0 for both).  There is therefore no need to
maintain the header's object version any more, so stop doing so.

We'll be able to simplify some more rbd code in the next few patches
as a result of this.
