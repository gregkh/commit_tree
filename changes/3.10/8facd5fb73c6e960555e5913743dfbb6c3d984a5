net: fix smatch warnings inside datagram_poll

Commit 7d4c04fc170087119727119074e72445f2bb192b ("net: add option to enable
error queue packets waking select") has an issue due to operator precedence
causing the bit-wise OR to bind to the sock_flags call instead of the result of
the terniary conditional. This fixes the *_poll functions to work properly. The
old code results in "mask |= POLLPRI" instead of what was intended, which is to
only include POLLPRI when the socket option is enabled.
