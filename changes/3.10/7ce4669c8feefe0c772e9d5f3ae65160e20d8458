regulator: ab8500: Added get_optimum_mode on regulators with idle mode

With this change, Vtvout, Vintcore12, Vaux1, 2 and 3 regulators
support DRMS (Dynamic Regulator Mode Switching) which will
dynamically handle requests for max current consumption from
several consumers and select a suitable regulator mode.
