xfs: Update xfs_log_commit_cil() comments

xfs_log_commit_iclog() function has been removed by commits 93b8a585:
	xfs: remove the deprecated nodelaylog option

Beginning from Linux 3.3, only delayed logging is supported so that
we call xfs_log_commit_cil() at xfs_trans_commit() only, remove the
useless comments so.
