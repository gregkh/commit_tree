ARM: at91: rename board-dt to more specific name board-dt-sam9

We will produce a board-dt file per SoC core type. That will ease code
readability and will prevent from including superfluous code for supporting
machines that will never be compiled together (particularly the ARM9 and C-A5
upcoming SoCs).
