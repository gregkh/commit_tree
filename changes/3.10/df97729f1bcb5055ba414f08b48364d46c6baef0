drm/i915: add msecs_to_jiffies_timeout to guarantee minimum duration

We need this to avoid premature timeouts whenever scheduling a timeout
based on the current jiffies value. For an explanation see [1].
The following patches will take the helper into use.

Once the more generic solution proposed in the thread at [1] is accepted
this patch can be reverted while keeping the follow-up patches.
