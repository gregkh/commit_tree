fs: fix fsync() error reporting

There are two convenient ways to report errors to userspace

1) retun error to original syscall for example write(2)
2) mark mapping with error flag and return it on later fsync(2)

Second one is broken if (mapping->nrpages == 0) This is real-life
situation because after error pages are likey to be truncated or
invalidated.

We have to return an error regardless to number of pages in the mapping.
