rbd: issue a copyup for layered writes

This implements the main copyup functionality for layered writes.

Here we add a copyup_pages field to the object request, which is
used only for copyup requests to keep track of the page array
containing data read from the parent image.

A copyup request is currently the only request rbd has that requires
two osd operations.  Because of this we handle copyup specially.
All image object requests get an osd request allocated when they are
created.  For a write request, if a copyup is required, the osd
request originally allocated is released, and a new one (with room
for two osd ops) is allocated to replace it.  A new function
rbd_osd_req_create_copyup() allocates an osd request suitable for
a copyup request.

The first op is then filled with a copyup object class method call,
supplying the array of pages containing data read from the parent.
The second op is filled in with the original write request.

The original request otherwise remains intact, and it describes the
original write request (found in the second osd op).  The presence
of the copyup op is sort of implicit; a non-null copyup_pages field
could be used to distinguish between a "normal" write request and a
request containing both a copyup call and a write.
