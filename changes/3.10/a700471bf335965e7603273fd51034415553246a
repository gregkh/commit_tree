drbd: abort start of resync early, if it raced with connection breakage

We've seen a spurious full resync, because a connection breakage
raced with drbd_start_resync(, C_SYNC_TARGET),
and the resulting state change request intended to start the resync
ended up looking like a local invalidate.

Fix:
Double check the state inside the lock,
and don't even request that state change,
if we had connection or IO problems.
