Revert "ALSA: hda - Don't set up active streams twice"

This reverts commit affdb62b815b38261f09f9d4ec210a35c7ffb1f3.

The commit introduced a regression with AD codecs where the stream is
always clean up.  Since the patch is just a minor optimization and
reverting the commit fixes the issue, let's just revert it.
