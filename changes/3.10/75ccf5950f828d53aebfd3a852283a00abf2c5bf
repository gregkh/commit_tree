workqueue: prepare flush_workqueue() for dynamic creation and destrucion of unbound pool_workqueues

Unbound pwqs (pool_workqueues) will be dynamically created and
destroyed with the scheduled unbound workqueue w/ custom attributes
support.  This patch synchronizes pwq linking and unlinking against
flush_workqueue() so that its operation isn't disturbed by pwqs coming
and going.

Linking and unlinking a pwq into wq->pwqs is now protected also by
wq->flush_mutex and a new pwq's work_color is initialized to
wq->work_color during linking.  This ensures that pwqs changes don't
disturb flush_workqueue() in progress and the new pwq's work coloring
stays in sync with the rest of the workqueue.

flush_mutex during unlinking isn't strictly necessary but it's simpler
to do it anyway.
