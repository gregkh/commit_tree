KVM: emulator: fix unimplemented instruction detection

Unimplemented instruction detection is broken for group instructions
since it relies on "flags" field of opcode to be zero, but all
instructions in a group inherit flags from a group encoding. Fix that by
having a separate flag for unimplemented instructions.
