tracing: Use RING_BUFFER_ALL_CPUS for TRACE_PIPE_ALL_CPU

Both RING_BUFFER_ALL_CPUS and TRACE_PIPE_ALL_CPU are defined as
-1 and used to say that all the ring buffers are to be modified
or read (instead of just a single cpu, which would be >= 0).

There's no reason to keep TRACE_PIPE_ALL_CPU as it is also started
to be used for more than what it was created for, and now that
the ring buffer code added a generic RING_BUFFER_ALL_CPUS define,
we can clean up the trace code to use that instead and remove
the TRACE_PIPE_ALL_CPU macro.
