ARM: imx: replicate the diagnostic register of boot cpu into secondary cores

The diagnostic register holds the errata bits.  Mostly bootloader
does not bring up secondary cores, so that when errata bits are set
in bootloader, they are set only for boot cpu.  But on a SMP
configuration, it should be equally done on every single core.
Set up the diagnostic register for secondary cores by replicating
the register from boot cpu.
