[SCSI] csiostor: off by one error

We need to store PROTO_ERR_IMPL_LOGO (26) things here, but the
first element isn't used so the array should have 27 elements.
This matches fwevt_to_rnevt[] which has 27 elements.

The patch solves a Smatch static checker warning on my system:
drivers/scsi/csiostor/csio_rnode.c:880 csio_rnode_fwevt_handler()
	error: buffer overflow '(rn)->stats.n_evt_fw' 26 <= 26
