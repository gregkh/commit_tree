batman-adv: Allow to modify slaves of soft-interfaces through rntl_link

The sysfs configuration interface of batman-adv to add/remove slaves of an
soft-iface is not deadlock free and doesn't follow the currently common way to
modify slaves of an interface.

An additional configuration interface though rtnl_link is introduced which
provides easy device adding/removing with tools like "ip":
$ ip link set dev eth0 master bat0
$ ip link set dev eth0 nomaster
