mac80211/minstrel_ht: increase sampling frequency of some slower rates

If a rate is below the max_tp_rate, sample it frequently if:
- it is above max_tp_rate2, or
- it is above max_prob_rate and is a candidate for max_prob_rate
  (has fewer streams than max_tp_rate).
This helps the retry chain recover more quickly from bad statistics
caused by collisions or interference, and slightly reduces throughput
fluctuations with higher rates.
