rbd: get rid of trivial v1 header wrappers

Get rid of the trivial wrapper functions rbd_dev_v1_refresh() and
rbd_dev_v1_probe(), substituting rbd_dev_v1_header_read() calls
in their place.

Rename rbd_dev_v1_header_read() to be rbd_dev_v1_header_info(), to
be more generic (it will better reflect what happens with format 2
images).
