drm/i915: Better overclock support

Most importantly this will allow users to set overclock frequencies in
sysfs. Previously the max was limited by the RP0 max as opposed to the
overclock max. This is useful if one wants to either limit the max
overclock frequency, or set the minimum frequency to be in the overclock
range. It also fixes an issue where if one sets the max frequency to be
below the overclock max, they wouldn't be able to set back the proper
overclock max.

In addition I've added a couple of other bits:
Show the overclock freq. as max in sysfs
Print the overclock max in debugfs.
Print a warning if the user sets the min frequency to be in the
overclock range.

In this patch I've decided to store the hw_max when we read it from the
pcode at init. The reason I do this is the pcode reads can fail, and are
slow.

v2: Report when user requested overclocked max (Daniel)
Remove when user sets min to overclock range (Daniel)
