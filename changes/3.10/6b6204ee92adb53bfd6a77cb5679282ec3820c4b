md: md_stop_writes() should always freeze recovery.

__md_stop_writes() will currently sometimes freeze recovery.
So any caller must be ready for that to happen, and indeed they are.

However if __md_stop_writes() doesn't freeze_recovery, then
a recovery could start before mddev_suspend() is called, which
could be awkward.  This can particularly cause problems or dm-raid.

So change __md_stop_writes() to always freeze recovery.  This is safe
and more predicatable.
