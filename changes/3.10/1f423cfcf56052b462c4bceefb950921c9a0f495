staging: comedi: no need to evade comedi_auto_unconfig()

When `comedi_unlocked_ioctl()` handled the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl via
a call to `do_devconfig()`, this used to be allowed to attach a legacy
hardware device to any board minor device, and the auto-unconfiguration
code for non-legacy used to search all board minor devices to find the
hardware device being removed.  After calling `do_devconfig()`
successfully, `comedi_unlocked_ioctl()` sets the `hardware_device`
member of the `struct comedi_file_info` to NULL to stop the
auto-unconfiguration code finding it by accident and unconfiguring the
wrong comedi device as a result.

The above is no longer necessary because `do_devconfig()` now only
allows legacy hardware devices to be attached to comedi board minor
device numbers below `comedi_num_legacy_minors` and the
auto-unconfiguration code (particularly
`comedi_release_hardware_device()`) only searches comedi board minor
device numbers greater than or equal to `comedi_num_legacy_minors`, so
there is no overlap.

Remove the now unnecessary setting of `info->hardware_device = NULL` in
`comedi_unlocked_ioctl()`.
