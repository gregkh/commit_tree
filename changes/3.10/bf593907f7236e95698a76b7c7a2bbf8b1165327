powerpc: Fix emulation of illegal instructions on PowerNV platform

Normally, the kernel emulates a few instructions that are unimplemented
on some processors (e.g. the old dcba instruction), or privileged (e.g.
mfpvr).  The emulation of unimplemented instructions is currently not
working on the PowerNV platform.  The reason is that on these machines,
unimplemented and illegal instructions cause a hypervisor emulation
assist interrupt, rather than a program interrupt as on older CPUs.
Our vector for the emulation assist interrupt just calls
program_check_exception() directly, without setting the bit in SRR1
that indicates an illegal instruction interrupt.  This fixes it by
making the emulation assist interrupt set that bit before calling
program_check_interrupt().  With this, old programs that use no-longer
implemented instructions such as dcba now work again.
