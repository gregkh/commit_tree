usb: gadget: f_obex: convert to new function interface with backward compatibility

Converting f_obex to the new function interface requires converting
the f_obex's function code and its users.

This patch converts the f_obex.c to the new function interface.
The file is now compiled into a separate usb_f_obex.ko module.

The old function interface is provided by means of preprocessor
conditional directives. After all users are converted, the old interface
can be removed.
