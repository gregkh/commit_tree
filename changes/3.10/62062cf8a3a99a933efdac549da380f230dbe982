audit: allow checking the type of audit message in the user filter

When userspace sends messages to the audit system it includes a type.
We want to be able to filter messages based on that type without have to
do the all or nothing option currently available on the
AUDIT_FILTER_TYPE filter list.  Instead we should be able to use the
AUDIT_FILTER_USER filter list and just use the message type as one part
of the matching decision.
