mwifiex: modify skb->truesize for PCIE Rx

We allocate SKB buffers of 4K size to make sure that we process
RX AMSDU of 4K. So when skb->len is lesser than 4K; we should
modify skb->truesize. This resolves an issue where kernel has
allocated packets with 2K assumption and starts dropping packets
for large size data transfer.

This fix is already present for USB; extend it to PCIE.
