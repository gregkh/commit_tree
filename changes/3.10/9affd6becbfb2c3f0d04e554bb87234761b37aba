arm: fix mismerge of arch/arm/mach-omap2/timer.c

I badly screwed up the merge in commit 6fa52ed33bea ("Merge tag
'drivers-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/.../arm-soc") by
incorrectly taking the arch/arm/mach-omap2/* data fully from the merge
target because the 'drivers-for-linus' branch seemed to be a proper
superset of the duplicate ARM commits.

That was bogus: commit ff931c821bab ("ARM: OMAP: clocks: Delay clk inits
atleast until slab is initialized") only existed in head, and the
changes to arch/arm/mach-omap2/timer.c from that commit got list.

Re-doing the merge more carefully, I do think this part was the only
thing I screwed up.  Knock wood.
