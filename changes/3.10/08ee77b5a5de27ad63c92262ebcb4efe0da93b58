pwm: lpc32xx: Properly set PWM_ENABLE bit in lpc32xx_pwm_[enable|disable]

According to the LPC32x0 User Manual [1]:

For both PWM1 and PWM2 Control Registers:
BIT 31:
This bit gates the PWM_CLK signal and enables the external output pin
to the PWM_PIN_STATE logical level.

0 = PWM disabled. (Default)
1 = PWM enabled

So in lpc32xx_pwm_enable(), we should set PWM_ENABLE bit.
In lpc32xx_pwm_disable(), we should just clear PWM_ENABLE bit rather than
write 0 to the register which will also clear PWMx_RELOADV and PWMx_DUTY bits.
