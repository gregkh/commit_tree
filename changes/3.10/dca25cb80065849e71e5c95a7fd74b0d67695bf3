drm: modify pages_to_sg prime helper to create optimized SG table

It fixes the issue arises due to passing 'nr_pages' in place of 'nents' to
sg_alloc_table. When ARM_HAS_SG_CHAIN is disabled, it is causing failure in
creating SG table for the buffers having more than 204 physical pages i.e.
equal to SG_MAX_SINGLE_ALLOC.

When using sg_alloc_table_from_pages interface, in place of sg_alloc_table,
page list will be passes to get each contiguous section which is represented
by a single entry in the table. For a Contiguous Buffer, number of entries
should be equal to 1.

Following check is causing the failure which is not applicable for Non-Contig
buffers:

	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(nents > max_ents))
		return -EINVAL;

Above patch is well tested for EXYNOS4 and EXYNOS5 for with/wihtout IOMMU
supprot. NOUVEAU and RADEON platforms also depends on drm_prime_pages_to_sg
helper function.
