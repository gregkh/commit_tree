ARM i.MX6q: Add GPU, VPU, IPU, and OpenVG resets to System Reset Controller (SRC)

The SRC has auto-deasserting reset bits that control reset lines to
the GPU, VPU, IPU, and OpenVG IP modules. This patch adds a reset
controller that can be controlled by those devices using the
reset controller API.
