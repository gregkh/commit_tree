cgroup: make sure parent won't be destroyed before its children

Suppose we rmdir a cgroup and there're still css refs, this cgroup won't
be freed. Then we rmdir the parent cgroup, and the parent is freed
immediately due to css ref draining to 0. Now it would be a disaster if
the still-alive child cgroup tries to access its parent.

Make sure this won't happen.
