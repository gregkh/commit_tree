mm: remove free_area_cache use in powerpc architecture

As all other architectures have been converted to use vm_unmapped_area(),
we are about to retire the free_area_cache.

This change simply removes the use of that cache in
slice_get_unmapped_area(), which will most certainly have a
performance cost. Next one will convert that function to use the
vm_unmapped_area() infrastructure and regain the performance.
