USB: serial: add generic TIOCMIWAIT implementation

Add generic TIOCMIWAIT implementation which correctly handles hangup,
USB-device disconnect, does not rely on the deprecated sleep_on
functions and hence does not suffer from the races currently affecting
several usb-serial drivers.

This makes it much easier to add TIOCMIWAIT support to subdrivers as the
tricky details related to hangup and disconnect (e.g. atomicity, that
the private port data may have been freed when woken up, and waking up
processes at disconnect) have been handled once and for all.

To add support to a subdriver, simply set the tiocmiwait-port-operation
field, update the port icount fields and wake up any process sleeping on
the tty-port modem-status-change wait queue on changes.

Note that the tty-port initialised flag can be used to detect
disconnected as the port will be hung up as part of disconnect (and
cannot be reactivated due to the disconnected flag). However, as the
tty-port implementation currently wakes up processes before calling port
shutdown, the tty-hupping flag must also be checked to detect hangup for
now.
