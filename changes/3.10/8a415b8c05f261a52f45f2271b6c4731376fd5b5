efi, pstore: Read data from variable store before memcpy()

Seiji reported getting empty dmesg-* files, because the data was never
actually read in efi_pstore_read_func(), and so the memcpy() was copying
garbage data.

This patch necessitated adding __efivar_entry_get() which is callable
between efivar_entry_iter_{begin,end}(). We can also delete
__efivar_entry_size() because efi_pstore_read_func() was the only
caller.
