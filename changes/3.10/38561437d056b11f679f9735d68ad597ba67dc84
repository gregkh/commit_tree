ipvs: Use network byte order for sync message size

struct ip_vs_sync_mesg and ip_vs_sync_mesg_v0 are both sent across the wire
and used internally to store IPVS synchronisation messages.

Up until now the scheme used has been to convert the size field
to network byte order before sending a message on the wire and
convert it to host byte order when sending a message.

This patch changes that scheme to always treat the field
as being network byte order. This seems appropriate as
the structure is sent across the wire. And by consistently
treating the field has network byte order it is now possible
to take advantage of sparse to flag any future miss-use.
