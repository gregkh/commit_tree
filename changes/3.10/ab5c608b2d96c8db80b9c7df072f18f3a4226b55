drm/i915: Don't touch South Display when PCH_NOP

Interrupts, clock gating, LVDS, and GMBUS are all within the, "this will
be bad for CPU" range when we have PCH_NOP.

There is a bit of a hack in init clock gating. We want to do most of the
clock gating, but the part we skip will hang the system. It could
probably be abstracted a bit better, but I don't feel it's too
unsightly.

v2: Use inverse HAS_PCH_NOP check (Jani)

v3: Actually do what I claimed in v2 (spotted by Daniel)
Merge Ivybridge IRQ handler PCH check to decrease whitespace (Daniel)
Move LVDS bail into this patch (Ben)

v4: logical rebase conflict resolution with SDEIIR (Ben)

Brush up patch a bit and resolve conflicts:
- Adjust PCH_NOP checks due to Egbert's hpd handling rework.
- Addd a PCH_NOP check in the irq uninstall code.
- Resolve conflicts with Paulo's SDE irq handling race fix.

v5: Drop the added hunks in the ilk irq handler again, they're bogus.
OOps.
