numa, cpu hotplug: change links of CPU and node when changing node number by onlining CPU

When booting x86 system contains memoryless node, node numbers of CPUs
on memoryless node were changed to nearest online node number by
init_cpu_to_node() because the node is not online.

In my system, node numbers of cpu#30-44 and 75-89 were changed from 2 to
0 as follows:

  $ numactl --hardware
  available: 2 nodes (0-1)
  node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
  41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82
  83 84 85 86 87 88 89
  node 0 size: 32394 MB
  node 0 free: 27898 MB
  node 1 cpus: 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
  67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74
  node 1 size: 32768 MB
  node 1 free: 30335 MB

If we hot add memory to memoryless node and offine/online all CPUs on
the node, node numbers of these CPUs are changed to correct node numbers
by srat_detect_node() because the node become online.

In this case, node numbers of cpu#30-44 and 75-89 were changed from 0 to
2 in my system as follows:

  $ numactl --hardware
  available: 3 nodes (0-2)
  node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55
  56 57 58 59
  node 0 size: 32394 MB
  node 0 free: 27218 MB
  node 1 cpus: 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
  67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74
  node 1 size: 32768 MB
  node 1 free: 30014 MB
  node 2 cpus: 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 75 76 77 78 79 80 81
  82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89
  node 2 size: 16384 MB
  node 2 free: 16384 MB

But "cpu to node" and "node to cpu" links were not changed as follows:

  $ ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu30/|grep node
  node0
  $ ls /sys/devices/system/node/node0/|grep cpu30
  cpu30

"numactl --hardware" shows that cpu30 belongs to node 2.  But sysfs
links does not change.

This patch changes "cpu to node" and "node to cpu" links when node
number changed by onlining CPU.
