bonding: allow TSO being set on bonding master

In some situations, we need to disable TSO on bonding slaves.

bonding device automatically unset TSO in bond_fix_features(), and
performance is not good because :

1) We consume more cpu cycles.

2) GSO segmentation has some bugs leading to out of order TCP packets
if this segmentation is done before virtual device. This particular
problem will be addressed in a separate patch.

This patch allows TSO being set/unset on the bonding master,
so that GSO segmentation is done after bonding layer.
