ACPI / dock: Initialize ACPI dock subsystem upfront

Commit 3b63aaa70e1 (PCI: acpiphp: Do not use ACPI PCI subdriver
mechanism) introduced an ACPI dock support regression, because it
changed the relative initialization order of the ACPI dock subsystem
and the ACPI-based PCI hotplug (acpiphp).

Namely, the ACPI dock subsystem has to be initialized before
acpiphp_enumerate_slots() is first run, which after commit
3b63aaa70e1 happens during the initial enumeration of the PCI
hierarchy triggered by the initial ACPI namespace scan in
acpi_scan_init().  For this reason, the dock subsystem has to be
initialized before the initial ACPI namespace scan in
acpi_scan_init().

To make that happen, modify the ACPI dock subsystem to be
non-modular and add the invocation of its initialization routine,
acpi_dock_init(), to acpi_scan_init() directly before the initial
namespace scan.
