ACPI / LPSS: register clock device for Lynxpoint DMA properly

The DMA controller in Lynxpoint is enumerated as a regular ACPI device now. To
work properly it is using the LPSS root clock as a functional clock. That's why
we have to register the clock device accordingly to the ACPI ID of the DMA
controller. The acpi_lpss.c module is responsible to do the job.

This patch also removes hardcoded name of the DMA device in clk-lpt.c and the
name of the root clock in acpi_lpss.c.
