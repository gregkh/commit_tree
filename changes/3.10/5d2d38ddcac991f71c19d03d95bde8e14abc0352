drm/i915: clean up pipe bpp confusion

- gen4 and earlier (save for g4x) only really have a 8bpc pipe, with
  the possibility to dither to 6bpc using the panel fitter
- g4x has hdmi, but no 12 bpc pipe ... !? Clamp hdmi accordingly.
- TV/SDVO out are the only connectors available on platforms with
  a pipe bpp != 8, add code to force the pipe to 8bpc unconditionally.

<rant>
The dither handling on gmch platforms is one giant disaster. I'm hoping
somewhat that vlv enabling will fix this up, but given that the 6bpc
handling for edp was simply added with another quick hack, I don't have
high hopes ...
</rant>

v2: Neither vlv nor g4x have 12bpc pipes. Still set pipe_bpp to 12*3,
but let the crtc code clamp things down to 10bpc on these platforms.

v3: Fix a bpc vs. bpp mixup in the gen4 and earlier pipe_bpp limiter
code.

v4: Drop the hunk in intel_hdmi.c about g4x/vlv 12bpc, it was wrong.
