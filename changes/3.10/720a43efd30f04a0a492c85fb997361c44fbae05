drivers:net: Remove unnecessary OOM messages after netdev_alloc_skb

Emitting netdev_alloc_skb and netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align OOM
messages is unnecessary as there is already a dump_stack
after allocation failures.

Other trivial changes around these removals:

Convert a few comparisons of pointer to 0 to !pointer.
Change flow to remove unnecessary label.
Remove now unused variable.
Hoist assignment from if.
