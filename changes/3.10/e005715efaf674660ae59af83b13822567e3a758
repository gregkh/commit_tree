drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c: don't disable hpet emulation on suspend

There's a bug where rtc alarms are ignored after the rtc cmos suspends
but before the system finishes suspend.  Since hpet emulation is
disabled and it still handles the interrupts, a wake event is never
registered which is done from the rtc layer.

This patch reverts commit d1b2efa83fbf ("rtc: disable hpet emulation on
suspend") which disabled hpet emulation.  To fix the problem mentioned
in that commit, hpet_rtc_timer_init() is called directly on resume.
