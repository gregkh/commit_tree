powerpc/pseries: Perform proper max_bus_speed detection

On pseries machines the detection for max_bus_speed should be done
through an OpenFirmware property. This patch adds a function to perform
this detection and a hook to perform dynamic adding of the function only
for pseries. This is done by overwriting the weak
pcibios_root_bridge_prepare function which is called by
pci_create_root_bus().
