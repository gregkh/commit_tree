tuntap: fix a possible race between queue selection and changing queues

Complier may generate codes that re-read the tun->numqueues during
tun_select_queue(). This may be a race if vlan->numqueues were changed in the
same time and can lead unexpected result (e.g. very huge value).

We need prevent the compiler from generating such codes by adding an
ACCESS_ONCE() to make sure tun->numqueues were only read once.

Bug were introduced by commit c8d68e6be1c3b242f1c598595830890b65cea64a
(tuntap: multiqueue support).
