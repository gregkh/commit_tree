omap2+: Remove useless Makefile line

Merge commit 952414505f55afe5cd6dc004765076aa22b3ed7e ("Merge branch
'next/cleanup' of git://git.linaro.org/people/arnd/arm-soc") added
references to CONFIG_MACH_PCM049 and board-omap4pcm049.o to this
Makefile. But there's no Kconfig symbol MACH_PCM049 and there's no file
board-omap4pcm049.c. This line can safely be removed.
