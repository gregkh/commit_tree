workqueue: kick a worker in pwq_adjust_max_active()

If pwq_adjust_max_active() changes max_active from 0 to
saved_max_active, it needs to wakeup worker.  This is already done by
thaw_workqueues().

If pwq_adjust_max_active() increases max_active for an unbound wq,
while not strictly necessary for correctness, it's still desirable to
wake up a worker so that the requested concurrency level is reached
sooner.

Move wake_up_worker() call from thaw_workqueues() to
pwq_adjust_max_active() so that it can handle both of the above two
cases.  This also makes thaw_workqueues() simpler.
