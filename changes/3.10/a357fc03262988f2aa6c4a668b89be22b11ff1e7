workqueue: protect wq->saved_max_active with wq->mutex

We're expanding wq->mutex to cover all fields specific to each
workqueue with the end goal of replacing pwq_lock which will make
locking simpler and easier to understand.

This patch makes wq->saved_max_active protected by wq->mutex instead
of pwq_lock.  As pwq_lock locking around pwq_adjust_mac_active() is no
longer necessary, this patch also replaces pwq_lock lockings of
for_each_pwq() around pwq_adjust_max_active() to wq->mutex.

tj: Rebased on top of the current dev branch.  Updated description.
