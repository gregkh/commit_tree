acpi: video: enhance the quirk detect logic of _BQC

Currently we decide if the _BQC is using index by first setting the
level to maximum, and then check if _BQC returned maximum; if not, we
say it is using index.

This is not true for some buggy systems, where the _BQC method will
always return a constant value(e.g. 0 or 100 for the two broken system)
and thus break the current logic. So this patch tries to enhance the
quirk detect logic for _BQC: we do this by picking a test_level, it can
be the maximum level or the mininum one based on some condition. And we
don't make the assumption that if _BQC returned a value that is not what
we just set, it must be using an index. Instead, we will compare the
value returned from _BQC and if it doesn't match, see if the returned
value is an index. And if still no, clear the capability of _BQC.
