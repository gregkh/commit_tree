sfc: Disable RSS when using SR-IOV and only 1 RX queue on the PF

On Siena, VFs share RSS configuration with the PF.  We attempted to
support configurations where the PF only uses 1 RX queue and VFs use
multiple RX queues, by (1) setting up RSS for the number of RX queues
per VF (2) disabling RSS in the PF's RX default filters.

Unfortunately commit cd2d5b529cdb ('sfc: Add SR-IOV back-end support
for SFC9000 family') only included (1).  This is (2).
