brcmsmac: remove brcms_bss_cfg->BSS

This was a read only member. The checks using BSS are replaced by
better fitting checks of the new type member.

The change in brcms_c_tbtt() was based on code from b43, in
brcms_c_ps_allowed() the same happens with BSS being true or false,
beaconing and probe responses are just needed in ap mode.
