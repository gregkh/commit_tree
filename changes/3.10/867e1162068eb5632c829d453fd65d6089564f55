bcache: Fix incompatible pointer type warning

The function pointer release in struct block_device_operations
should point to functions declared as void.

Sparse warnings:

drivers/md/bcache/super.c:656:27: warning:
	incorrect type in initializer (different base types)
	drivers/md/bcache/super.c:656:27:
	expected void ( *release )( ... )
	drivers/md/bcache/super.c:656:27:
	got int ( static [toplevel] *<noident> )( ... )

drivers/md/bcache/super.c:656:2: warning:
	initialization from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]

drivers/md/bcache/super.c:656:2: warning:
	(near initialization for ‘bcache_ops.release’) [enabled by default]
