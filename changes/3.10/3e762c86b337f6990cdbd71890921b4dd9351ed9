arm: mach-orion5x: use mv_mbus_dram_info() in PCI code

The PCI code was directly accessing the orion_mbus_dram_info structure
to get access to a description of the SDRAM chip selects in order to
configure the PCIe -> SDRAM address decoding windows.

However, with the introduction of the mvebu-mbus driver, we are going
to remove this global structure and instead leave only the exported
mv_mbus_dram_info() function to access this description of the SDRAM
chip selects. Therefore, we simply switch to using this API.
