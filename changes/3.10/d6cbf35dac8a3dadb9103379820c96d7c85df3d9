cgroup: initialize xattr before calling d_instantiate()

cgroup_create_file() calls d_instantiate(), which may decide to look
at the xattrs on the file. Smack always does this and SELinux can be
configured to do so.

But cgroup_add_file() didn't initialize xattrs before calling
cgroup_create_file(), which finally leads to dereferencing NULL
dentry->d_fsdata.

This bug has been there since cgroup xattr was introduced.
