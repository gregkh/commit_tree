powerpc: fixing ptrace_get_reg to return an error

Currently ptrace_get_reg returns error as a value
what make impossible to tell whether it is a correct value or error code.

The patch adds a parameter which points to the real return data and
returns an error code.

As get_user_msr() never fails and it is used in multiple places so it has not
been changed by this patch.
