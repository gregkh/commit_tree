Btrfs: handle running extent ops with skinny metadata

Chris hit a bug where we weren't finding extent records when running extent ops.
This is because we use the delayed_ref_head when running the extent op, which
means we can't use the ->type checks to see if we are metadata.  We also lose
the level of the metadata we are working on.  So to fix this we can just check
the ->is_data section of the extent_op, and we can store the level of the buffer
we were modifying in the extent_op.  Thanks,
