x86: Fix section mismatch on load_ucode_ap

We are in the process of removing all the __cpuinit annotations.
While working on making that change, an existing problem was
made evident:

  WARNING: arch/x86/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x198f2): Section mismatch
  in reference from the function cpu_init() to the function
  .init.text:load_ucode_ap()   The function cpu_init() references
  the function __init load_ucode_ap().  This is often because cpu_init
  lacks a __init annotation or the annotation of load_ucode_ap is wrong.

This now appears because in my working tree, cpu_init() is no longer
tagged as __cpuinit, and so the audit picks up the mismatch.  The 2nd
hypothesis from the audit is the correct one, as there was an incorrect
__init tag on the prototype in the header (but __cpuinit was used on
the function itself.)

The audit is telling us that the prototype's __init annotation took
effect and the function did land in the .init.text section.  Checking
with objdump on a mainline tree that still has __cpuinit shows that
the __cpuinit on the function takes precedence over the __init on the
prototype, but that won't be true once we make __cpuinit a no-op.

Even though we are removing __cpuinit, we temporarily align both
the function and the prototype on __cpuinit so that the changeset
can be applied to stable trees  if desired.
