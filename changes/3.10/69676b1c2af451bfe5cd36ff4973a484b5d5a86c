Bluetooth: btmrvl: report error if verify_fw_download times out

FW does the synchronization of the different modules during init.
It will report different modules, that it is ready at different times.
The fw download 'winner' will be reported fw ready first. Without this
patch, btmrvl was already continuing before the FW told it too. Probably
on behalf of the 'winner' which then never sees FW ready and times out.
