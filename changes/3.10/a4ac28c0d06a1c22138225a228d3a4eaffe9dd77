batman-adv: Allow to use rntl_link for device creation/deletion

The sysfs configuration interface of batman-adv to add/remove soft-interfaces
is not deadlock free and doesn't follow the currently common way to create new
virtual interfaces.

An additional interface though rtnl_link is introduced which provides easy device
creation/deletion with tools like "ip":

$ ip link add dev bat0 type batadv
$ ip link del dev bat0
