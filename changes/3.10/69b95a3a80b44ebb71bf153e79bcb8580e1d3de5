[media] s3c-camif: Fail on insufficient number of allocated buffers

Ensure the driver gets always at least its minimum required
number of buffers allocated by checking actual number of
allocated buffers in vb2_reqbufs(). And free any partially
allocated buffer queue with signaling an error to user space.
Without this patch applications may wait forever to dequeue
a filled buffer, because the hardware didn't even start after
VIDIOC_STREAMON, VIDIOC_QBUF calls, due to insufficient number
of empty buffers.
