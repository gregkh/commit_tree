rtc-at91rm9200: add match-table compile guard

The members of Atmel's at91sam9x5 family (9x5) have a broken RTC
interrupt mask register (AT91_RTC_IMR).  It does not reflect enabled
interrupts but instead always returns zero.

The kernel's rtc-at91rm9200 driver handles the RTC for the 9x5 family.
Currently when the date/time is set, an interrupt is generated and this
driver neglects to handle the interrupt.  The kernel complains about the
un-handled interrupt and disables it henceforth.  This not only breaks
the RTC function, but since that interrupt is shared (Atmel's SYS
interrupt) then other things break as well (e.g.  the debug port no
longer accepts characters).

Tested on the at91sam9g25.  Bug confirmed by Atmel.

This patch (of 5):

Add missing match-table compile guard.
