btrfs: clean snapshots one by one

Each time pick one dead root from the list and let the caller know if
it's needed to continue. This should improve responsiveness during
umount and balance which at some point waits for cleaning all currently
queued dead roots.

A new dead root is added to the end of the list, so the snapshots
disappear in the order of deletion.

The snapshot cleaning work is now done only from the cleaner thread and the
others wake it if needed.
