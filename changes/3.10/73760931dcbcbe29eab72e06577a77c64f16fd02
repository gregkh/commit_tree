powerpc/perf: Add basic assembly code to read BHRB entries on POWER8

This patch adds the basic assembly code to read BHRB buffer. BHRB entries
are valid only after a PMU interrupt has happened (when MMCR0[PMAO]=1)
and BHRB has been freezed. BHRB read should not be attempted when it is
still enabled (MMCR0[PMAE]=1) and getting updated, as this can produce
non-deterministic results.
