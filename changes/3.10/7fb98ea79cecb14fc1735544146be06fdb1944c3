workqueue: replace get_pwq() with explicit per_cpu_ptr() accesses and first_pwq()

get_pwq() takes @cpu, which can also be WORK_CPU_UNBOUND, and @wq and
returns the matching pwq (pool_workqueue).  We want to move away from
using @cpu for identifying pools and pwqs for unbound pools with
custom attributes and there is only one user - workqueue_congested() -
which makes use of the WQ_UNBOUND conditional in get_pwq().  All other
users already know whether they're dealing with a per-cpu or unbound
workqueue.

Replace get_pwq() with explicit per_cpu_ptr(wq->cpu_pwqs, cpu) for
per-cpu workqueues and first_pwq() for unbound ones, and open-code
WQ_UNBOUND conditional in workqueue_congested().

Note that this makes workqueue_congested() behave sligntly differently
when @cpu other than WORK_CPU_UNBOUND is specified.  It ignores @cpu
for unbound workqueues and always uses the first pwq instead of
oopsing.
