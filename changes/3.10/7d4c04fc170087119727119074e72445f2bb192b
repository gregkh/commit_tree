net: add option to enable error queue packets waking select

Currently, when a socket receives something on the error queue it only wakes up
the socket on select if it is in the "read" list, that is the socket has
something to read. It is useful also to wake the socket if it is in the error
list, which would enable software to wait on error queue packets without waking
up for regular data on the socket. The main use case is for receiving
timestamped transmit packets which return the timestamp to the socket via the
error queue. This enables an application to select on the socket for the error
queue only instead of for the regular traffic.
