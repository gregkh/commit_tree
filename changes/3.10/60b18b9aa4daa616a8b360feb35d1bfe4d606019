gpio/omap: remove extra context restores in *_runtime_resume()

68942edb09f69b6e09522d1d346665eb3aadde49 (gpio/omap: fix wakeups
on level-triggered GPIOs) already restores the fallingdetect and
risingdetect contexts in *_runtime_resume(). These registers were
modified in *_runtime_suspend() to include even those configured
as level-triggered since only edge-triggered gpios can generate
wakeup events. Therefore, the old context restores of the same
registers present later in the code is not needed any more.
Remove them.
