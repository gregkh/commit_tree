inotify: invalid mask should return a error number but not set it

When we run the crackerjack testsuite, the inotify_add_watch test is
stalled.

This is caused by the invalid mask 0 - the task is waiting for the event
but it never comes.  inotify_add_watch() should return -EINVAL as it did
before commit 676a0675cf92 ("inotify: remove broken mask checks causing
unmount to be EINVAL").  That commit removes the invalid mask check, but
that check is needed.

Check the mask's ALL_INOTIFY_BITS before the inotify_arg_to_mask() call.
If none are set, just return -EINVAL.

Because IN_UNMOUNT is in ALL_INOTIFY_BITS, this change will not trigger
the problem that above commit fixed.
