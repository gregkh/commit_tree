drm: Add 1600x1200 (UXGA) screen resolution to the built-in EDIDs

The 1600x1200 (UXGA) screen resolution was lacking in the set of
built-in selectable EDID screen resolutions that can be used to
repair misbehaving monitor firmware.

This patch adds the related data set and expands the documentation.
