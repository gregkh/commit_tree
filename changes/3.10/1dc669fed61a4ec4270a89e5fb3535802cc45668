ALSA: usb-audio: UAC2: support read-only freq control

Some clocks might be read-only, e.g., external clocks (see also
UAC2 4.7.2.1).

In this case, setting the sample frequency will always fail
(even if the rate is equal to the current clock rate),
therefore do not write, but read the value and compare to the
requested rate.
If the clock is read only, avoid reading it twice.

If it doesn't match, return -ENXIO since the clock is invalid for
this configuration.
