leds: add camera LED triggers

Some LED devices support flash/torch functionality through the LED subsystem.
This patch enables direct LED trigger controls by the driver.
Flash on/off and torch on/off can be done simply by other driver space.
Two trigger APIs are added, ledtrig_flash_ctrl() and ledtrig_torch_ctrl().
