rwsem: do not block readers at head of queue if other readers are active

This change fixes a race condition where a reader might determine it
needs to block, but by the time it acquires the wait_lock the rwsem has
active readers and no queued waiters.

In this situation the reader can run in parallel with the existing
active readers; it does not need to block until the active readers
complete.

Thanks to Peter Hurley for noticing this possible race.
