tpm: Add support for new Infineon I2C TPM (SLB 9645 TT 1.2 I2C)

This driver adds support for Infineon's new SLB 9645 TT 1.2 I2C TPMs,
which supports clockstretching, combined reads and a bus speed of
up to 400khz. The device also has a new device id.

The driver works now also fine with device trees, so you can
instantiate your device by adding:
 +       tpm {
 +               compatible = "infineon,slb9645tt";
 +               reg = <0x20>;
 +       };
 for SLB 9645 devices or

 +       tpm {
 +               compatible = "infineon,slb9635tt";
 +               reg = <0x20>;
 +       };
 for SLB 9635 devices

to your device tree.
tpm_i2c_infineon is also retained as a compatible id as a fallback to
slb9635 protocol.

The driver was tested on Beaglebone.
