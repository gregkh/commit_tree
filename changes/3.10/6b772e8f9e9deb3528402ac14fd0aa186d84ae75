ACPI: Update PNPID match handling for notify

When installing/removing a notify handler to/from an ACPI device
object, ACPI core tries to match its associated scan handler to
see if it supports hotplug.  However, the matching logic of the
notify handler is different from the matching logic of attaching
a scan handler to an ACPI device object.  This patch updates the
matching logic of the notify handlers to be consistent with the
attach handling.
