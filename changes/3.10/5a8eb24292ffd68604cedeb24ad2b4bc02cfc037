pci: Add SRIOV helper function to determine if VFs are assigned to guest

This function is meant to add a helper function that will determine if a PF
has any VFs that are currently assigned to a guest.  We currently have been
implementing this function per driver, and going forward I would like to avoid
that by making this function generic and using this helper.

v2: Removed extern from declaration of pci_vfs_assigned in pci.h and return
    0 if SR-IOV is disabled with is inline with other PCI SRIOV functions.
