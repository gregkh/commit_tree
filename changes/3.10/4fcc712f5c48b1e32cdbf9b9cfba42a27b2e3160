aio: fix io_destroy() regression by using call_rcu()

There was a regression introduced by 36f5588905c1 ("aio: refcounting
cleanup"), reported by Jens Axboe - the refcounting cleanup switched to
using RCU in the shutdown path, but the synchronize_rcu() was done in
the context of the io_destroy() syscall greatly increasing the time it
could block.

This patch switches it to call_rcu() and makes shutdown asynchronous
(more asynchronous than it was originally; before the refcount changes
io_destroy() would still wait on pending kiocbs).

Note that there's a global quota on the max outstanding kiocbs, and that
quota must be manipulated synchronously; otherwise io_setup() could
return -EAGAIN when there isn't quota available, and userspace won't
have any way of waiting until shutdown of the old kioctxs has finished
(besides busy looping).

So we release our quota before kioctx shutdown has finished, which
should be fine since the quota never corresponded to anything real
anyways.
