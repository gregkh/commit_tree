rbd: look up snapshot name in names buffer

Rather than scanning the list of snapshot structures for it, scan
the snapshot context buffer containing snapshot names in order to
determine for a format 1 image the name associated with a given
snapshot id.

Pull out the part of rbd_dev_v1_snap_info() that does this scan into
a new function, _rbd_dev_v1_snap_name().  Have that function return
a dynamically-allocated copy of the name, and don't duplicate it in
rbd_dev_v1_snap_info().
