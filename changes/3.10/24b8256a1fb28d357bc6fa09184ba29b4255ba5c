drivers/rtc/rtc-twl.c: fix missing device_init_wakeup() when booted with device tree

When booted in legacy mode device_init_wakeup() gets called by
drivers/mfd/twl-core.c when the children are initialized.  However, when
booted using device tree, the children are created with
of_platform_populate() instead add_children().

This means that the RTC driver will not have device_init_wakeup() set,
and we need to call it from the driver probe like RTC drivers typically
do.

Without this we cannot test PM wake-up events on omaps for cases where
there may not be any physical wake-up event.
