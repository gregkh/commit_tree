tcp: reset timer after any SYNACK retransmit

Linux immediately returns SYNACK on (spurious) SYN retransmits, but
keeps the SYNACK timer running independently. Thus the timer may
fire right after the SYNACK retransmit and causes a SYN-SYNACK
cross-fire burst.

Adopt the fast retransmit/recovery idea in established state by
re-arming the SYNACK timer after the fast (SYNACK) retransmit. The
timer may fire late up to 500ms due to the current SYNACK timer wheel,
but it's OK to be conservative when network is congested. Eric's new
listener design should address this issue.
