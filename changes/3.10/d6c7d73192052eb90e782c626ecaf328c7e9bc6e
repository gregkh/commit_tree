regulator: as3711: Use a static of_regulator_match table for of_regulator_match

The same table can be used for multiple instance of pdev, so we don't need to
allocate memory for of_regulator_match table per pdev.

match->driver_data points to the corresponding entry of as3711_reg_info,
however it is not used in current code, thus this patch does not set
driver_data in the of_regulator_match table.
