fat: introduce 2 new values for the -o nfs mount option

This patchset eliminates the client side ESTALE errors when a FAT
partition exported over NFS has its dentries evicted from the cache.  The
idea is to find the on-disk location_'i_pos' of the dirent of the inode
that has been evicted and use it to rebuild the inode.

This patch:

Provide two possible values 'stale_rw' and 'nostale_ro' for the -o nfs
mount option.The first one allows all file operations but does not reduce
ESTALE errors on memory constrained systems.  The second one eliminates
ESTALE errors but mounts the filesystem as read-only.  Not specifying a
value defaults to 'stale_rw'.
