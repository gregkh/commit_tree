KVM: PPC: Book3S: Add API for in-kernel XICS emulation

This adds the API for userspace to instantiate an XICS device in a VM
and connect VCPUs to it.  The API consists of a new device type for
the KVM_CREATE_DEVICE ioctl, a new capability KVM_CAP_IRQ_XICS, which
functions similarly to KVM_CAP_IRQ_MPIC, and the KVM_IRQ_LINE ioctl,
which is used to assert and deassert interrupt inputs of the XICS.

The XICS device has one attribute group, KVM_DEV_XICS_GRP_SOURCES.
Each attribute within this group corresponds to the state of one
interrupt source.  The attribute number is the same as the interrupt
source number.

This does not support irq routing or irqfd yet.
