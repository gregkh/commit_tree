PCI/PM: Fix fallback to PCI_D0 in pci_platform_power_transition()

Commit b51306c (PCI: Set device power state to PCI_D0 for device
without native PM support) modified pci_platform_power_transition()
by adding code causing dev->current_state for devices that don't
support native PCI PM but are power-manageable by the platform to be
changed to PCI_D0 regardless of the value returned by the preceding
platform_pci_set_power_state().  In particular, that also is done
if the platform_pci_set_power_state() has been successful, which
causes the correct power state of the device set by
pci_update_current_state() in that case to be overwritten by PCI_D0.

Fix that mistake by making the fallback to PCI_D0 only happen if
the platform_pci_set_power_state() has returned an error.
