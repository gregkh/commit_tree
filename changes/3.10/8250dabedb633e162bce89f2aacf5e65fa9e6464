Correct allowed raid levels on balance.

Raid5 with 3 devices is well defined while the old logic allowed
raid5 only with a minimum of 4 devices when converting the block group
profile via btrfs balance. Creating a raid5 with just three devices
using mkfs.btrfs worked always as expected. This is now fixed and the
whole logic is rewritten.
