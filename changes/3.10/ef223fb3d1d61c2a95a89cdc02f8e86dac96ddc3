tty/vt: Return EBUSY if deallocating VT1 and it is busy

Commit 421b40a6286e ("tty/vt: Fix vc_deallocate() lock order") changed
the behavior when deallocating VT 1.  Previously if trying to
deallocate VT1 and it is busy, we would return EBUSY.  The commit
changed this to return 0 (success).

This commit restores the old behavior.
