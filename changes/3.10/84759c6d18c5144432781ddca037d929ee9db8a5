Revert "rw_semaphore: remove up/down_read_non_owner"

This reverts commit 11b80f459adaf91a712f95e7734a17655a36bf30.

Bcache needs rw semaphores for cache coherency in writeback mode -
writes have to take a read lock on a per cache device rw sem, and
release it when the bio completes.

But since this is for bios it's naturally not in the context of the
process that originally took the lock.
