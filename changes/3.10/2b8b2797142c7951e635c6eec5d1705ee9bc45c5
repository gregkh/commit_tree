ARM: plat-orion: Fix num_resources and id for ge10 and ge11

When platform data were moved from arch/arm/mach-mv78xx0/common.c to
arch/arm/plat-orion/common.c with the commit "7e3819d ARM: orion:
Consolidate ethernet platform data", there were few typo made on
gigabit Ethernet interface ge10 and ge11. This commit writes back
their initial value, which allows to use this interfaces again.
