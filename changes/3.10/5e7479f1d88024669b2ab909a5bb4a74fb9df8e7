staging: comedi: addi_apci_16xx: remove the boardinfo from the comedi_driver

This driver uses the comedi auto attach mechanism and does not need
to supply the 'num_names', 'board_name', and 'offset' fields so that
the comedi core can search the boardinfo. These fields are only used
for the legacy attach.
