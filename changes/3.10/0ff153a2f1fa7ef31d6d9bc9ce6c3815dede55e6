f2fs: do not skip writing file meta during fsync

This patch removes data_version check flow during the fsync call.
The original purpose for the use of data_version was to avoid writng inode
pages redundantly by the fsync calls repeatedly.
However, when user can modify file meta and then call fsync, we should not
skip fsync procedure.
So, let's remove this condition check and hope that user triggers in right
manner.
