mtd: nand: remove AG-AND support

We have only one AG-AND driver and it was not touched since 2005. It looks
like AG-AND was not really make it to mass-production and can be considered
a dead technology.

Along with the AG-AND support, this patch removes the BBT_AUTO_REFRESH feature,
because the only user of this feature is AG-AND. And even though it is
implemented as a generic feature, I prefer to remove it because NAND flashes do
not really need it in this form.
