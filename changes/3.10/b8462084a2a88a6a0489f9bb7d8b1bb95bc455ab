rcu: Push lock release to rcu_start_gp()'s callers

If CPUs are to give prior notice of needed grace periods, it will be
necessary to invoke rcu_start_gp() without dropping the root rcu_node
structure's ->lock.  This commit takes a second step in this direction
by moving the release of this lock to rcu_start_gp()'s callers.
