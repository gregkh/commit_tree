KVM: PPC: Book3S: Facilities to save/restore XICS presentation ctrler state

This adds the ability for userspace to save and restore the state
of the XICS interrupt presentation controllers (ICPs) via the
KVM_GET/SET_ONE_REG interface.  Since there is one ICP per vcpu, we
simply define a new 64-bit register in the ONE_REG space for the ICP
state.  The state includes the CPU priority setting, the pending IPI
priority, and the priority and source number of any pending external
interrupt.
