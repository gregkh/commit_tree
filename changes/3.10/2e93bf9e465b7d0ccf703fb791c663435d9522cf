rbd: remove parent devices on probe error

When an error occurs while finishing probing a device it is assumed
that parent devices get cleaned up when deleting a device.  They
don't.  Add a call to clean them up.  Note that this means the
parent spec will already be cleaned up so it doesn't have to be
in one of the rbd_add() error paths.
