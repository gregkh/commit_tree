powerpc: Fix missing/delayed calls to irq_work

When replaying interrupts (as a result of the interrupt occurring
while soft-disabled), in the case of the decrementer, we are exclusively
testing for a pending timer target. However we also use decrementer
interrupts to trigger the new "irq_work", which in this case would
be missed.

This change the logic to force a replay in both cases of a timer
boundary reached and a decrementer interrupt having actually occurred
while disabled. The former test is still useful to catch cases where
a CPU having been hard-disabled for a long time completely misses the
interrupt due to a decrementer rollover.
