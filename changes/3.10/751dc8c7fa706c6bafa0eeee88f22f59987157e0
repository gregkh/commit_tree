[media] dib0090: Fix a warning at dib0090_set_EFUSE

The check if the values for c, h and n are within the range is
always true, as, if one of this values is out of range, the
previous "if" clauses will default to a value within the
range.

That fixes the following warning:

	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0090.c: In function 'dib0090_set_EFUSE':
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0090.c:1545:5: warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type [-Wtype-limits]

and makes the code easier to read.
