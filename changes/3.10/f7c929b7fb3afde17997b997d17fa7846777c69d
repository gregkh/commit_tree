staging: comedi: addi_apci_3200: use the pci id_table 'driver_data'

Create an enum to the boardinfo and pass that enum in the pci_driver
id_table as the driver_data.

Change the macro used to fill in the device table from PCI_DEVICE()
to PCI_VDEVICE(). This allows passing the enum as the next field.

Set the dev->board_ptr before calling addi_auto_attach(). This
removes the need for the common code to search for the boardinfo.

Since the search is not done we can remove the unnecessary board
information from the comedi_driver.

For aesthetic reasons, move the pci device table near the pci_driver.
