xfs: fix remote attribute invalidation for a leaf

When invalidating an attribute leaf block block, there might be
remote attributes that it points to. With the recent rework of the
remote attribute format, we have to make sure we calculate the
length of the attribute correctly. We aren't doing that in
xfs_attr3_leaf_inactive(), so fix it.
