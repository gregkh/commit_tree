tracing: Compare to 1 instead of zero for is_signed_type()

The formats of the trace events show if the type of a event field
is signed or not via a macro called is_signed_type(). This does
a trick with the type and compares a -1 to zero after typecasting
to the tested type. If it returns true, it's signed, otherwise
its not. But this unfortunately triggers a warning by gcc:

  warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false

As we know it is always false (that's why we do it), this is a
false warning. Luckily for us, the comparison works with a 1 as
well, without giving the warning.

Convert the check to compare (type)-1 < (type)0 to (type)-1 < (type)1
to determine if the type is signed or not.
