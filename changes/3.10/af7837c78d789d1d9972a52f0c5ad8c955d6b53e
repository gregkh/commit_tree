powerpc/fsl-booke: Add B4_QDS board support

- Add support for B4 board in board file b4_qds.c,
  It is common for B4860, B4420 and B4220QDS as they share same QDS board
- Add B4QDS support in Kconfig and Makefile

B4860QDS is a high-performance computing evaluation, development and
test platform supporting the B4860 QorIQ Power Architecture processor,
with following major features:

    - Four dual-threaded e6500 Power Architecture processors
      organized in one cluster-each core runs up to 1.8 GHz
    - Two DDR3/3L controllers for high-speed memory interface each
      runs at up to 1866.67 MHz
    - CoreNet fabric that fully supports coherency using MESI protocol
      between the e6500 cores, SC3900 FVP cores, memories and
      external interfaces.
    - Data Path Acceleration Architecture having FMAN, QMan, BMan,
      SEC 5.3 and RMAN
    - Large internal cache memory with snooping and stashing capabilities
    - Sixteen 10-GHz SerDes lanes that serve:
        - Two SRIO interfaces. Each supports up to 4 lanes and
          a total of up to 8 lanes
        - Up to 8-lanes Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) controller
          for glue-less antenna connection
        - Two 10-Gbit Ethernet controllers (10GEC)
        - Six 1G/2.5-Gbit Ethernet controllers for network communications
        - PCI Express controller
        - Debug (Aurora)
    - Various system peripherals

B4420 and B4220 have some differences in comparison to B4860 with fewer
core/clusters(both SC3900 and e6500), fewer DDR controllers,
fewer serdes lanes, fewer SGMII interfaces and reduced target frequencies.

Key differences between B4860 and B4420:
B4420 has:
    - Fewer e6500 cores:
        1 cluster with 2 e6500 cores
    - Fewer SC3900 cores/clusters:
        1 cluster with 2 SC3900 cores per cluster
    - Single DDRC @ 1.6GHz
    - 2 X 4 lane serdes
    - 3 SGMII interfaces
    - no sRIO
    - no 10G

Key differences between B4860 and B4220:

    - Fewer SC3900 cores/clusters:
        1 cluster with 2 SC3900 cores per cluster
    - Single DDRC @ 1.33GHz
    - 2 X 2 lane serdes
    - 2 SGMII interfaces
    - no sRIO
    - no 10G
