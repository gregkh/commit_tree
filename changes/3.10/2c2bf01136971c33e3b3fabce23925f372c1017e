KVM: Use eoi to track RTC interrupt delivery status

Current interrupt coalescing logci which only used by RTC has conflict
with Posted Interrupt.
This patch introduces a new mechinism to use eoi to track interrupt:
When delivering an interrupt to vcpu, the pending_eoi set to number of
vcpu that received the interrupt. And decrease it when each vcpu writing
eoi. No subsequent RTC interrupt can deliver to vcpu until all vcpus
write eoi.
