drm/i915: fix up _wait_for macro

As Thomas Gleixner spotted, it's rather horrible racy:
- We can miss almost a full tick, so need to compensate by 1 jiffy.
- We need to re-check the condition when having timed-out, since a
  the last check could have been before the timeout expired. E.g. when
  we've been preempted or a long irq happened.
