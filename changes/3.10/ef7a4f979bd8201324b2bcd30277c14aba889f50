ALSA: add DSD formats

This patch adds two formats for Direct Stream Digital (DSD), a
pulse-density encoding format which is described here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Stream_Digital

DSD operates on 2.8, 5.6 or 11.2MHz sample rates and as a 1-bit
stream.

The two new types added by this patch describe streams that are capable
of handling DSD samples in DOP format as 8-bit or in 16-bit (or at a x8
or x16 data rate, respectively).

DSD itself specifies samples in *bit*, while DOP and ALSA handle them
as *bytes*. Hence, a factor of 8 or 16 has to be applied for the sample
rare configuration, according to the following table:

                                                  configured hardware
        176.4KHz   352.8kHz   705.6KHz     <----       sample rate

8-bit                2.8MHz     5.6MHz
16-bit    2.8Mhz     5.6MHz    11.2MHz
