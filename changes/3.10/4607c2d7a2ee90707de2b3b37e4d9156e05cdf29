KVM: nVMX: Introduce vmread and vmwrite bitmaps

Prepare vmread and vmwrite bitmaps according to a pre-specified list of fields.
These lists are intended to specifiy most frequent accessed fields so we can
minimize the number of fields that are copied from/to the software controlled
VMCS12 format to/from to processor-specific shadow vmcs. The lists were built
measuring the VMCS fields access rate after L2 Ubuntu 12.04 booted when it was
running on top of L1 KVM, also Ubuntu 12.04. Note that during boot there were
additional fields which were frequently modified but they were not added to
these lists because after boot these fields were not longer accessed by L1.
