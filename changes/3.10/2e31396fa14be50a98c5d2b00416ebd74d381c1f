packet: tx timestamping on tpacket ring

When transmit timestamping is enabled at the socket level, record a
timestamp on packets written to a PACKET_TX_RING. Tx timestamps are
always looped to the application over the socket error queue. Software
timestamps are also written back into the packet frame header in the
packet ring.
