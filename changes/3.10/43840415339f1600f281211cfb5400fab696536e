input: matrix-keymap: Add function to read the new DT binding

We now have a binding which adds two parameters to the matrix keypad DT
node. This is separate from the GPIO-driven matrix keypad binding, and
unfortunately incompatible, since that uses row-gpios/col-gpios for the
row and column counts.

So the easiest option here is to provide a function for non-GPIO drivers
to use to decode the binding.

Note: We could in fact create an entirely separate structure to hold
these two fields, but it does not seem worth it, yet. If we have more
parameters then we can add this, and then refactor each driver to hold
such a structure.
