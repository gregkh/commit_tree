tracing: Enable snapshot when any latency tracer is enabled

The snapshot utility is extremely useful, and does not add any more
overhead in memory when another latency tracer is enabled. They use
the snapshot underneath. There's no reason to hide the snapshot file
when a latency tracer has been enabled in the kernel.

If any of the latency tracers (irq, preempt or wakeup) is enabled
then also select the snapshot facility.

Note, snapshot can be enabled without the latency tracers enabled.
