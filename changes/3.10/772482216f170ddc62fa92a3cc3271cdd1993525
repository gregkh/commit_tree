tracing: Get trace_events kernel command line working again

With the new descriptors used to allow multiple buffers in the
tracing directory added, the kernel command line parameter
trace_events=... no longer works. This is because the top level
(global) trace array now has a list of descriptors associated
with the events and the files in the debugfs directory. But in
early bootup, when the command line is processed and the events
enabled, the trace array list of events has not been set up yet.

Without the list of events in the trace array, the setting of
events to record will fail because it would not match any events.

The solution is to set up the top level array in two stages.
The first is to just add the ftrace file descriptors that just point
to the events. This will allow events to be enabled and start tracing.
The second stage is called after the filesystem is set up, and this
stage will create the debugfs event files and directories associated
with the trace array events.
