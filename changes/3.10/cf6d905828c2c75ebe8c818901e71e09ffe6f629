MIPS: microMIPS: Fix macro naming in micro-assembler.

The macros did not properly take into account the ISA that
the kernel was being compiled with. A classic MIPS kernel
will have the standard 'uasm_i_##op' macro functions with
'MM_uasm_i_##op' macro functions for the microMIPS version.
A pure microMIPS kernel will have the standard macros with
'CL_uasm_i_##op' macro functions for the classic version.
