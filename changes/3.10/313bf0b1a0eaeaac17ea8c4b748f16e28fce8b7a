                                                         brightness ctrl
                                                       <actual driving here>

Flash/torch LEDs are controlled by other driver using LED camera trigger
APIs, ledtrig_flash_ctrl()/ledtrig_torch_ctrl().
Then, actual device control is activated by each LED driver such like
LM355x or LM3642.
