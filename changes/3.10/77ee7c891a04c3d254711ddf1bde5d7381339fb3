cfg80211: comprehensively check station changes

The station change API isn't being checked properly before
drivers are called, and as a result it is difficult to see
what should be allowed and what not.

In order to comprehensively check the API parameters parse
everything first, and then have the driver call a function
(cfg80211_check_station_change()) with the additionally
information about the kind of station that is being changed;
this allows the function to make better decisions than the
old code could.

While at it, also add a few checks, particularly in mesh
and clarify the TDLS station lifetime in documentation.

To be able to reduce a few checks, ignore any flag set bits
when the mask isn't set, they shouldn't be applied then.
