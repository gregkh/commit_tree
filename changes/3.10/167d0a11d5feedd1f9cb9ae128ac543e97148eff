ALSA: asihpi: add format support check in snd_card_asihpi_capture_formats

Some Asihpi formats are not supported or invalid, and their mapping to
ALSA format is set to -1.
Before performing the format conversion into ALSA bitwise formats,
add a consistency check for the requested format, as done in
snd_card_asihpi_playback_formats().

Compile tested only.
