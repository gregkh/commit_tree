MN10300: Fix ret_from_kernel_thread

ret_from_kernel_thread needs to set A2 to the thread_info pointer before
jumping to syscall_exit.

Without this, we never correctly start userspace.

This was caused by the rejuggling of the fork/exec paths in commit
ddf23e87a804 ("mn10300: switch to saner kernel_execve() semantics")
