pinctrl: check pinctrl ready for gpio range

pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range() only checks whether a certain GPIO pin
is in gpio range. But maybe some GPIO pins don't have back-end pinctrl
interface, it means that these pins are always configured as GPIO
function. For example, gpio159 isn't related to back-end pinctrl device
in Hi3620 while other GPIO pins are related to back-end pinctrl device.

Append pinctrl_ready_for_gpio_range() that is used to check whether
pinctrl device with GPIO range is ready. This function will be called
after pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range() fails.

If pinctrl device with GPIO range is found, it means that pinctrl device
is already launched and a certain GPIO pin just don't have back-end pinctrl
interface. Then pinctrl_request_gpio() shouldn't return -EPROBE_DEFER in
this case.
