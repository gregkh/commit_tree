kconfig/menu.c: fix multiple references to expressions in menu_add_prop()

menu_add_prop() applies upper menus' visibilities to actual prompts
by AND-ing the prompts visibilities with the upper menus ones.

This creates a further reference to the menu's visibilities and when
the expression reduction functions do their work, they may remove or
modify expressions that have multiple references, thus causing
unpredictable side-effects.

The following example Kconfig constructs a case where this causes
problems: a menu and a prompt which's visibilities depend on the same
symbol.  When invoking mconf with this Kconfig and pressing "Z" we
see a problem caused by a free'd expression still referenced by the
menu's visibility:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
mainmenu "Kconfig Testing Configuration"

config VISIBLE
	def_bool n

config Placeholder
	bool "Place holder"

menu "Invisible"
	visible if VISIBLE

config TEST_VAR
	bool "Test option" if VISIBLE

endmenu
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This patch fixes this problem by creating copies of the menu's
visibility expressions before AND-ing them with the prompt's one.
