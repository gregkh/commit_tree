pwm: davinci: Add Kconfig support for ECAP & EHRPWM devices

Add EHRPWM and ECAP support build support for DAVINCI_DA8XX platforms.

Also, since DAVINCI platforms doesn't support TI-PWM-Subsystem module,
remove the select option for CONFIG_PWM_TIPWMSS.

Also, update CONFIG_PWM_TIPWMSS compiler directive appropriately in
pwm-tipwmss.h to fix the below compiler error upon removal of
CONFIG_PWM_TIPWMSS for DAVINCI platforms.
