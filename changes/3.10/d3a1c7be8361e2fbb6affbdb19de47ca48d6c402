clk: composite: rename 'div' references to 'rate'

Rename all div_hw and div_ops related variables and functions to use
rate_hw, rate_ops, etc.  This is to make the rate-change portion of the
composite clk implementation more generic.  A patch following this one
will allow for fixed-rate clocks to reuse this infrastructure.
