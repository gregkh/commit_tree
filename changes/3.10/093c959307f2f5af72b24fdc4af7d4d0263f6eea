mtip32xx: Correctly handle bio->bi_idx != 0 conditions

Stacking drivers may append bvecs to existing bio's, resulting
in non-zero bi_idx conditions.  This patch counts the loops of
bio_for_each_segment() rather than inheriting the bi_idx value
to pass as a segment count to the hardware submission routine.
