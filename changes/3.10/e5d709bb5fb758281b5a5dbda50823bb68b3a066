s390/memory hotplug: provide memory_block_size_bytes() function

Commit 0c2c99b1b "memory hotplug: Allow memory blocks to span
multiple memory sections" introduced a weak memory_block_size_bytes()
function which can be used to set the size of a memory block as
seen in sysfs.
Provide an s390 specific override which makes sure that each
memory block has at least a size of 256MB or the increment size of
of a memory increment, whatever is larger.
This way we can make sure that the number of memory sysfs objects
doesn't explode for very large memory configurations.
