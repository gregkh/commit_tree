staging: dwc2: fix wrong setting of DMA masks

We were setting the DMA masks in dwc2_driver_probe(), but that is
before the driver parameters have been set to their default values.
That meant the DMA masks could be set wrong. Fix it by moving the
DMA mask setting into dwc2_hcd_init(), after the driver parameters
have been set.
