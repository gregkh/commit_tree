ALSA: hda - Disable the sanity check in snd_hda_add_pincfg()

When pin default configs are overridden via patch option, these are
evaluated before fixups are applied.  Since some fixups change the
whole codec trees and/or add pins dynamically, this sanity check might
not pass when pins aren't present at the time the function is called.

We may reorder the execution, but an easier fix is simply to disable
this sanity check.
