powerpc/pseries: Update firmware_has_feature() to check architecture vector 5 bits

The firmware_has_feature() function makes it easy to check for supported
features of the hypervisor. This patch extends the capability of
firmware_has_feature() to include checking for specified bits
in vector 5 of the architecture vector as reported in the device tree.

As part of this the #defines used for the architecture vector are re-defined
such that each option has the index into vector 5 and the feature bit encoded
into it. This makes checking for architecture bits when initiating data
for firmware_has_feature much easier.
