clk: samsung: Fix pll36xx_recalc_rate to handle kdiv properly

The KDIV value is often listed as unsigned but it needs to be treated
as a 16-bit signed value when using it in calculations.  Fix our rate
recalculation to do this correctly.

Before doing this, I tried setting EPLL on exynos5250 to:
  rate, m, p, s, k = 80000000, 107, 2, 4, 43691

This rate is exactly from the table in the exynos5250 user manual.

I read this back as 80750003 with:
  cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/fin_pll/fout_epll/clk_rate

After this patch, it reads back as 80000003
