misc: apds990x: add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions

Add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions to fix the following
build warning when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not selected. This is because
sleep PM callbacks defined by SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS are only used
when the CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled.

drivers/misc/apds990x.c:1205:12: warning: 'apds990x_suspend' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/misc/apds990x.c:1214:12: warning: 'apds990x_resume' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
