rbd: set the mapping size and features later

Defer setting the size and features fields of a mapped image until
after the Linux disk structure is set up.  Set the capacity of the
disk after that.

Rearrange the definition of rbd_image_header, separating the fields
that are set only once from those that can be updated.
