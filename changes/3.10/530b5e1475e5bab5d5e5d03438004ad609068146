powerpc/pseries: Move architecture vector definitions to prom.h

As part of handling of PRRN events we need to check vector 5 of the
architecture vector bits reported in the device tree to ensure PRRN event
handling is enabled. To do this firmware_has_feature() is updated (in a
subsequent patch) to make this check vector 5 bits. To avoid having to
re-define bits in the architecture vector the bit definitions are moved
to prom.h.
