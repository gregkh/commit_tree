xen-netback: better names for thresholds

This patch only changes some names to avoid confusion.

In this patch we have:

  MAX_SKB_SLOTS_DEFAULT -> FATAL_SKB_SLOTS_DEFAULT
  max_skb_slots -> fatal_skb_slots
  #define XEN_NETBK_LEGACY_SLOTS_MAX XEN_NETIF_NR_SLOTS_MIN

The fatal_skb_slots is the threshold to determine whether a packet is
malicious.

XEN_NETBK_LEGACY_SLOTS_MAX is the maximum slots a valid packet can have at
this point. It is defined to be XEN_NETIF_NR_SLOTS_MIN because that's
guaranteed to be supported by all backends.
