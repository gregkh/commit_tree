idle: Remove unused ARCH_HAS_DEFAULT_IDLE

The Kconfig symbol ARCH_HAS_DEFAULT_IDLE is unused. Commit
a0bfa1373859e9d11dc92561a8667588803e42d8 ("cpuidle: stop
depending on pm_idle") removed the only place were it was
actually used. But it did not remove its Kconfig entries (for sh
and x86). Remove those two entries now.
