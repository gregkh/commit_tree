drm/i915: Workaround incoherence between fences and LLC across multiple CPUs

In order to fully serialize access to the fenced region and the update
to the fence register we need to take extreme measures on SNB+, and
manually flush writes to memory prior to writing the fence register in
conjunction with the memory barriers placed around the register write.

Fixes i-g-t/gem_fence_thrash

v2: Bring a bigger gun
v3: Switch the bigger gun for heavier bullets (Arjan van de Ven)
v4: Remove changes for working generations.
v5: Reduce to a per-cpu wbinvd() call prior to updating the fences.
v6: Rewrite comments to ellide forgotten history.
