mm: remove old aio use_mm() comment

Bunch of performance improvements and cleanups Zach Brown and I have
been working on.  The code should be pretty solid at this point, though
it could of course use more review and testing.

The results in my testing are pretty impressive, particularly when an
ioctx is being shared between multiple threads.  In my crappy synthetic
benchmark, with 4 threads submitting and one thread reaping completions,
I saw overhead in the aio code go from ~50% (mostly ioctx lock
contention) to low single digits.  Performance with ioctx per thread
improved too, but I'd have to rerun those benchmarks.

The reason I've been focused on performance when the ioctx is shared is
that for a fair number of real world completions, userspace needs the
completions aggregated somehow - in practice people just end up
implementing this aggregation in userspace today, but if it's done right
we can do it much more efficiently in the kernel.

Performance wise, the end result of this patch series is that submitting
a kiocb writes to _no_ shared cachelines - the penalty for sharing an
ioctx is gone there.  There's still going to be some cacheline
contention when we deliver the completions to the aio ringbuffer (at
least if you have interrupts being delivered on multiple cores, which
for high end stuff you do) but I have a couple more patches not in this
series that implement coalescing for that (by taking advantage of
interrupt coalescing).  With that, there's basically no bottlenecks or
performance issues to speak of in the aio code.

This patch:

use_mm() is used in more places than just aio.  There's no need to mention
callers when describing the function.
