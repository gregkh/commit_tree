cgroup: remove bind() method from cgroup_subsys.

The bind() method of cgroup_subsys is not used in any of the
controllers (cpuset, freezer, blkio, net_cls, memcg, net_prio,
devices, perf, hugetlb, cpu and cpuacct)

tj: Removed the entry on ->bind() from
    Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt.  Also updated a couple
    paragraphs which were suggesting that dynamic re-binding may be
    implemented.  It's not gonna.
