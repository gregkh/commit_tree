rbd: use snap_id not index to look up snap info

In order to align with what was needed for format 1 rbd images,
rbd_dev_v2_snap_info() was set up to take as argument an index into
the array of snapshot ids in a rbd device's snapshot context.

This switches that around, so we pass the snapshot id instead.
In doing this, rbd_snap_name() now returns a dynamically-allocated
string rather than a fixed one, so there's no need to make a
duplicate in its caller, rbd_dev_spec_update().

This means the following functions take a snapshot id where they
previously used an index value:
    rbd_dev_snap_info()
    rbd_dev_v1_snap_info()
    rbd_dev_v2_snap_info()

A new function, rbd_dev_snap_index(), determines the snap index for
format 1 images and uses it to look up the name.
