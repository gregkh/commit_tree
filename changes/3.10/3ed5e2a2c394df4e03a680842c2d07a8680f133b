SUNRPC: Report network/connection errors correctly for SOFTCONN rpc tasks

In the case of a SOFTCONN rpc task, we really want to ensure that it
reports errors like ENETUNREACH back to the caller. Currently, only
some of these errors are being reported back (connect errors are not),
and they are being converted by the RPC layer into EIO.
