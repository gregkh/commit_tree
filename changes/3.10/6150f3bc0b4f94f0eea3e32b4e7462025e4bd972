ARM: AT91SAM9G45: same platform data structure for all crypto peripherals

Only AES use DMA in AT91SAM9G45 (TDES and SHA use PDC).

However latest Atmel TDES and SHA IP releases use DMA instead of PDC.
  --> Atmel TDES and SHA drivers need DMA platform data for those IP releases.

Goal of this patch is to use the same platform data structure for all Atmel
crypto peripherals. This structure contains information about DMA interface.
