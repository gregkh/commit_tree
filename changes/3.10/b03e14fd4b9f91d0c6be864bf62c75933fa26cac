drm/omap: Take a fb reference in omap_plane_update()

When userspace calls SET_PLANE ioctl, drm core takes a reference of the fb and
passes control to the update_plane op defined by the drm driver.

In omapdrm, we have a worker thread which queues framebuffers objects received
from update_plane and displays them at the appropriate time.

It is possible that the framebuffer is destoryed by userspace between the time
of calling the ioctl and apply-worker being scheduled. If this happens, the
apply-worker holds a pointer to a framebuffer which is already destroyed.

Take an extra refernece/unreference of the fb in omap_plane_update() to prevent
this from happening. A reference is taken of the fb passed to update_plane(),
the previous framebuffer (held by plane->fb) is unreferenced. This will prevent
drm from destroying the framebuffer till the time it's unreferenced by the
apply-worker.

This is in addition to the exisitng reference/unreference in update_pin(),
which is taken for the scanout of the plane's current framebuffer, and an
unreference the previous framebuffer.
