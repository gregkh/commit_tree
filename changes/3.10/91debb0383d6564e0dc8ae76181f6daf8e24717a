tty: ifx6x60: Remove unused suspend/resume callbacks

The ifx6x60 driver implements both legacy suspend/resume callbacks and
dev_pm_ops. The SPI core is going to ignore legacy suspend/resume
callbacks if a driver implements dev_pm_ops. Since the legacy suspend/resume
callbacks are empty in this case it is safe to just remove them.
