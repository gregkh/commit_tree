kvm/ppc/mpic: add KVM_CAP_IRQ_MPIC

Enabling this capability connects the vcpu to the designated in-kernel
MPIC.  Using explicit connections between vcpus and irqchips allows
for flexibility, but the main benefit at the moment is that it
simplifies the code -- KVM doesn't need vm-global state to remember
which MPIC object is associated with this vm, and it doesn't need to
care about ordering between irqchip creation and vcpu creation.
