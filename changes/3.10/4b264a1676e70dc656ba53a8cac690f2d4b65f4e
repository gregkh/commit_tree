3c59x: fix PCI resource management

The driver wrongly claimed I/O ports at an address returned by pci_iomap() --
even if it was passed an MMIO address.  Fix this by claiming/releasing all PCI
resources in the PCI driver's probe()/remove() methods instead and get rid of
'must_free_region' flag weirdness (why would Cardbus claim anything for us?).
