vsprintf: Add extension %pSR - print_symbol replacement

print_symbol takes a long and converts it to a function
name and offset.  %pS does something similar, but doesn't
translate the address via __builtin_extract_return_addr.
%pSR does the translation.

This will enable replacing multiple calls like
	printk(...);
	printk_symbol(addr);
	printk("\n");
with a single non-interleavable in dmesg
	printk("... %pSR\n", (void *)addr);

Update documentation too.
