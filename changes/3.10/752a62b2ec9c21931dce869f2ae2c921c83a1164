[media] cx24123: improve precision when calculating symbol rate ratio

Symbol rate ratio were using a rough calculus, as the code was
limited to 32 bits arithmetic. Change it to 64 bits, in order
to better estimate the bandwidth low-pass filter on the demod.
This should reduce the noise and improve reception.
