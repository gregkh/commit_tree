ALSA: hda - fixup D3 pin and right channel mute on Haswell HDMI audio

When graphics initializes the HDMI chip, sometimes this leads to
pins going into D3 and right channel being muted. If the audio driver
finishes initialization before the graphic driver does, this situation
becomes permanent.

This is a workaround that checks for this situation and corrects it on
playback prepare. It has been verified working on at least one machine.
