slab: Return NULL for oversized allocations

The inline path seems to have changed the SLAB behavior for very large
kmalloc allocations with  commit e3366016 ("slab: Use common
kmalloc_index/kmalloc_size functions"). This patch restores the old
behavior but also adds diagnostics so that we can figure where in the
code these large allocations occur.
