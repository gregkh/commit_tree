net/davinci_cpdma: don't check for jiffies with interrupts

__cpdma_chan_process() holds the lock with interrupts off (and its
caller as well), same goes for cpdma_ctlr_start(). With interrupts off,
jiffies will not make any progress and if the wait condition never gets
true we wait for ever.
Tgis patch adds a a simple udelay and counting down attempt.
