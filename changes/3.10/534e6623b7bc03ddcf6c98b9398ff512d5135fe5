Btrfs: add all ioctl checks before user change for quota operations

Since all the quota configurations are loaded in memory, and we can
have ioctl checks before operating in the disk. It is safe to do such
things because qgroup_ioctl_lock is held outside.

Without these extra checks firstly, it should be ok to do user change
for quota operations. For example:

if we want to add an existed qgroup, we will do:
	->add_qgroup_item()
		->add_qgroup_rb()

add_qgroup_item() will return -EEXIST to us, however, qgroups are all
in memory, why not check them in memory firstly.
