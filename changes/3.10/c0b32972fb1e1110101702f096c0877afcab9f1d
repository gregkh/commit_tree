md/raid5: avoid an extra write when writing to a known-bad-block.

If we write to a known-bad-block it will be flags as having
a ReadError by analyse_stripe, but the write will proceed anyway
(as it should).  Then the read-error handling will kick in an
write again, then re-read.

We don't need that 'write-again', so set R5_ReWrite so it looks like
it has already been done.  Then we will just get the re-read, which we
want.
