x86, wakeup, sleep: Use pvops functions for changing GDT entries

We check the TSS descriptor before we try to dereference it.
Also we document what the value '9' actually means using the
AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Volume 2, pg 90:
"Hex value 9: Available 64-bit TSS" and pg 91:
"The available 32-bit TSS (09h), which is redefined as the
available 64-bit TSS."

Without this, on Xen, where the GDT is available as R/O (to
protect the hypervisor from the guest modifying it), we end up
with a pagetable fault.
