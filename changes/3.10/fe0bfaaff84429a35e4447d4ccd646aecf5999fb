mm: trace filemap add and del

Use the events API to trace filemap loading and unloading of file pieces
into the page cache.

This patch aims at tracing the eviction reload cycle of executable and
shared libraries pages in a memory constrained environment.

The typical usage is to spot a specific device and inode (for example
/lib/libc.so) to see the eviction cycles, and find out if frequently
used code is rather spread across many pages (bad) or coallesced (good).
