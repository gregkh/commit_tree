Bluetooth: Fix mgmt handling of power on failures

If hci_dev_open fails we need to ensure that the corresponding
mgmt_set_powered command gets an appropriate response. This patch fixes
the missing response by adding a new mgmt_set_powered_failed function
that's used to indicate a power on failure to mgmt. Since a situation
with the device being rfkilled may require special handling in user
space the patch uses a new dedicated mgmt status code for this.
