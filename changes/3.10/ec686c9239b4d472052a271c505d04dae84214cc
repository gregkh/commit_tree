fs/fscache/stats.c: fix memory leak

There is a kernel memory leak observed when the proc file
/proc/fs/fscache/stats is read.

The reason is that in fscache_stats_open, single_open is called and the
respective release function is not called during release.  Hence fix
with correct release function - single_release().
