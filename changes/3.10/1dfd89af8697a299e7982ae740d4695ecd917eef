LOCKD: Ensure that nlmclnt_block resets block->b_status after a server reboot

After a server reboot, the reclaimer thread will recover all the existing
locks. For locks that are blocked, however, it will change the value
of block->b_status to nlm_lck_denied_grace_period in order to signal that
they need to wake up and resend the original blocking lock request.

Due to a bug, however, the block->b_status never gets reset after the
blocked locks have been woken up, and so the process goes into an
infinite loop of resends until the blocked lock is satisfied.
