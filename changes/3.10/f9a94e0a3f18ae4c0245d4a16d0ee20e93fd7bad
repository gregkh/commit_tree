Revert "mmc: core: wait while adding MMC host to ensure root mounts successfully"

This reverts commit 3500ed90b26a9935b943b5e2e4cd3226600d6b58.

The reverted patch caused a significant performance regression when
booting with the root file system on eMMC.

Before the patch:

[    1.625623] VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) readonly on device 179:2.

After the patch:

[    1.935851] VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) readonly on device 179:2.

That was an addition of 310 ms which is a 19% performance degradation.
