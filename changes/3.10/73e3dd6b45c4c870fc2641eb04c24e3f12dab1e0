e1000e: fix numeric overflow in phc settime method

The PTP Hardware Clock settime function in the e1000e driver
computes nanoseconds from a struct timespec. The code converts the
seconds field .tv_sec by multiplying it with NSEC_PER_SEC. However,
both operands are of type long, resulting in an unintended overflow.
The patch fixes the issue by using the helper function from time.h.
