x86, quirks: Shut-up a long-standing gcc warning

So gcc nags about those since forever in randconfig builds.

arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c: In function ‘ati_ixp4x0_rev’:
arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c:361:4: warning: ‘b’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c: In function ‘ati_force_enable_hpet’:
arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c:367:4: warning: ‘d’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c:357:6: note: ‘d’ was declared here
arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c:407:21: warning: ‘val’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]

This function quirk is called on a SB400 chipset only anyway so the
distant possibility of a PCI access failing becomes almost impossible
there. Even if it did fail, then something else more serious is the
problem.

So zero-out the variables so that gcc shuts up but do a coarse check
on the PCI accesses at the end and signal whether any of them had an
error. They shouldn't but in case they do, we'll at least know and we
can address it.
