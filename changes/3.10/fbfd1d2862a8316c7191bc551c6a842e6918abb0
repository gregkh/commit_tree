ipc: fix double sem unlock in semctl error path

Fix another ipc locking buglet introduced by the scalability patches:
when semctl_down() was changed to delay the semaphore locking, one error
path for security_sem_semctl() went through the semaphore unlock logic
even though the semaphore had never been locked.

Introduced by commit 16df3674efe3 ("ipc,sem: do not hold ipc lock more
than necessary")
