ARM: bcm2835: override the HW UART periphid

Stephen Warren reported the recent commit 78506f2 (add support for
extended FIFO-size of PL011-r1p5) breaks the serial port on the
BCM2835 ARM SoC.

A UART compatible with the ARM PL011-r1p5 should have 32-deep FIFOs.
The BCM2835 UART just looks like an ARM PL011-r1p5, but has 16-deep
FIFOs just like PL011-r1p4 or earlier revisions. As a workaround for
this compatibility issue, this patch overrides the HW UART periphid
register values with the actually compatible UART periphid 0x00241011
(r1p3 or r1p4).
