uprobes: Use file_inode()

Cleanup. Now that we have f_inode/file_inode() we can use it instead
of vm_file->f_mapping->host.

This should not make any difference for uprobes, but in theory this
change is more correct. We use this inode as a key, to compare it
with uprobe->inode set by uprobe_register(inode), and the caller uses
d_inode.
