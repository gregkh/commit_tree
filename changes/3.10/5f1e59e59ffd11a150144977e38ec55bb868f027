brcmsmac: add support for probe response template

The ucode is able to answer probe response by itself. This writes such
a template into the specific memory. Currently the probe requests are
also send to mac80211 so there are more answers send to a requesting
client. We have to make the ucode stop sending probe requests to the
driver.
