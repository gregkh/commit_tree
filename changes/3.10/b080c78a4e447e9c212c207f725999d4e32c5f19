regulator: ab8500: Update voltage handling for fixed voltage regulators

There are a few over-lapping methods for voltage selection operating
in the AB8500 regulator driver currently. This patch removes unused,
unnecessary variables from the regulator_info structures and provides
voltage tables for those regulators which have fixed voltages.
