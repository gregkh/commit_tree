ACPI / scan: Introduce acpi_scan_match_handler()

Introduce helper routine acpi_scan_match_handler() that will find the
ACPI scan handler matching a given device ID, if there is one, and
rework acpi_scan_attach_handler() to use the new routine (that
routine will also be useful for other purposes going forward).
