x86/mm/cpa: Cleanup split_large_page() and its callee

So basically we're generating the pte_t * from a struct page and
we're handing it down to the __split_large_page() internal version
which then goes and gets back struct page * from it because it
needs it.

Change the caller to hand down struct page * directly and the
callee can compute the pte_t itself.

Net save is one virt_to_page() call and simpler code. While at
it, make __split_large_page() static.
