usb: phy: twl4030-usb: don't enable PHY during init

There is no need to do it, otg.set_suspend(false) (which itself
comes from runtime_pm OMAP glue calls) will enable it later anyway.
This used to be the place where things were enabled if booted with
cable connected before runtime_pm conversion, but now can be dropped.
