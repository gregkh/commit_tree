devres: allow adding custom actions to the stack

Sometimes drivers need to execute one-off actions in their error handling
or device teardown paths. An example would be toggling a GPIO line to
reset the controlled device into predefined state.

To allow performing such actions when using managed resources let's allow
adding them to stack/group of devres resources.
