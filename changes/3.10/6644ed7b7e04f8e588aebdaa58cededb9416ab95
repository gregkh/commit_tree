libceph: make message data be a pointer

Begin the transition from a single message data item to a list of
them by replacing the "data" structure in a message with a pointer
to a ceph_msg_data structure.

A null pointer will indicate the message has no data; replace the
use of ceph_msg_has_data() with a simple check for a null pointer.

Create functions ceph_msg_data_create() and ceph_msg_data_destroy()
to dynamically allocate and free a data item structure of a given type.

When a message has its data item "set," allocate one of these to
hold the data description, and free it when the last reference to
the message is dropped.

This partially resolves:
