KVM: MMU: make kvm_mmu_available_pages robust against n_used_mmu_pages > n_max_mmu_pages

As noticed by Ulrich Obergfell <uobergfe@redhat.com>, the mmu
counters are for beancounting purposes only - so n_used_mmu_pages and
n_max_mmu_pages could be relaxed (example: before f0f5933a1626c8df7b),
resulting in n_used_mmu_pages > n_max_mmu_pages.

Make code robust against n_used_mmu_pages > n_max_mmu_pages.
