x86/mm/hotplug: Put kernel_physical_mapping_remove() declaration in CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE

kernel_physical_mapping_remove() is only called by
arch_remove_memory() in init_64.c, which is enclosed in
CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE. So when we don't configure
CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE, the compiler will give a warning:

	warning: ‘kernel_physical_mapping_remove’ defined but not used

So put kernel_physical_mapping_remove() in
CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE.
