sierra_net: keep status interrupt URB active

The driver and firmware sync up through SYNC messages, and the
firmware's affirmative reply to these SYNC messages appears to be the
"Reset" indication received via the status interrupt endpoint.  Thus the
driver needs the status interrupt endpoint always active so that the
Reset indication can be received even if the netdev is closed, which is
the case right after device insertion.

If the Reset indication is not received by the driver, it continues
sending SYNC messages to the firmware, which crashes about 10 seconds
later and the device stops responding.
