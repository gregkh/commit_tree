ARM: exynos: add debug_ll_io_init() call in exynos_init_io()

If the early MMU mapping of the UART happens to get booted out of the
TLB between the start of paging_init() and when we finally re-add the
UART at the very end of s3c_init_cpu(), we'll get a hang at bootup if
we've got early_printk enabled.  Avoid this hang by calling
debug_ll_io_init() early.

Without this patch, you can reliably reproduce a hang when early
printk is enabled by adding flush_tlb_all() at the start of
exynos_init_io().  After this patch the hang goes away.
