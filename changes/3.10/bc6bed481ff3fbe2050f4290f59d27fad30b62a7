Docs: Expectations for bug reporters and maintainers

Outline how often it's polite to ping kernel maintainers about bugs, and
suggest that kernel maintainers should respond to bugs in 1 to 5
business days.

Emphasize that regressions, userspace breakage, and kernel crashes are
exceptions to that rule.  Suggest escalation to LKML and Linus if these
bugs are ignored during the merge window.
