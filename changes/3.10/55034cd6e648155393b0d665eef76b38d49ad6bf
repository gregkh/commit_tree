tracing: Add alloc_snapshot kernel command line parameter

If debugging the kernel, and the developer wants to use
tracing_snapshot() in places where tracing_snapshot_alloc() may
be difficult (or more likely, the developer is lazy and doesn't
want to bother with tracing_snapshot_alloc() at all), then adding

  alloc_snapshot

to the kernel command line parameter will tell ftrace to allocate
the snapshot buffer (if configured) when it allocates the main
tracing buffer.

I also noticed that ring_buffer_expanded and tracing_selftest_disabled
had inconsistent use of boolean "true" and "false" with "0" and "1".
I cleaned that up too.
