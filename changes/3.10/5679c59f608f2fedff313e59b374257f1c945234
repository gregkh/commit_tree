rbd: add target object existence flags

This creates two new flags for object requests to indicate what is
known about the existence of the object to which a request is to be
sent.  The KNOWN flag will be true if the the EXISTS flag is
meaningful.  That is:

    KNOWN   EXISTS
    -----   ------
      0       0     don't know whether the object exists
      0       1     (not used/invalid)
      1       0     object is known to not exist
      1       0     object is known to exist

This will be used in determining how to handle write requests for
data objects for layered rbd images.
