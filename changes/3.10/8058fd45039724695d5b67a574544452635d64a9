libceph: drop mutex on error in handle_reply()

The osd client mutex is acquired just before getting a reference to
a request in handle_reply().  However the error paths after that
don't drop the mutex before returning as they should.

Drop the mutex after dropping the request reference.  Also add a
bad_mutex label at that point and use it so the failed request
lookup case can be handled with the rest.
