proc: Make the PROC_I() and PDE() macros internal to procfs

Make the PROC_I() and PDE() macros internal to procfs.  This means making
PDE_DATA() out of line.  This could be made more optimal by storing
PDE()->data into inode->i_private.

Also provide a __PDE_DATA() that is inline and internal to procfs.
