802: fix a possible race condition

(Resend with a better changelog)

garp_pdu_queue() should ways be called with this spin lock.
garp_uninit_applicant() only holds rtnl lock which is not
enough here.  A possible race can happen as garp_pdu_rcv()
is called in BH context:

	garp_pdu_rcv()
	  |->garp_pdu_parse_msg()
	    |->garp_pdu_parse_attr()
	      |-> garp_gid_event()

Found by code inspection.
