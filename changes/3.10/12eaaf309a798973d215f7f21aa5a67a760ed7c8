set_task_comm: kill the pointless memset() + wmb()

set_task_comm() does memset() + wmb() before strlcpy().  This buys
nothing and to add to the confusion, the comment is wrong.

- We do not need memset() to be "safe from non-terminating string
  reads", the final char is always zero and we never change it.

- wmb() is paired with nothing, it cannot prevent from printing
  the mixture of the old/new data unless the reader takes the lock.
