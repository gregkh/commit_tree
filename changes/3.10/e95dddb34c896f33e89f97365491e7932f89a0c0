ARM: imx: enable anatop suspend/resume

Anatop module have sereval configurations for user
to reduce the power consumption in suspend, provide
suspend/resume interface for further use and enable
fet_odrive to reduce CORE LDO leakage during suspend.

As we have a common anatop file, remove all the operations
of anatop module in other files, use anatop interfaces to
do that.
