rcu: Provide compile-time control for no-CBs CPUs

Currently, the only way to specify no-CBs CPUs is via the rcu_nocbs
kernel command-line parameter.  This is inconvenient in some cases,
particularly for randconfig testing, so this commit adds a new set of
kernel configuration parameters.  CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_NONE (the default)
retains the old behavior, CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ZERO offloads callback
processing from CPU 0 (along with any other CPUs specified by the
rcu_nocbs boot-time parameter), and CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL offloads
callback processing from all CPUs.
