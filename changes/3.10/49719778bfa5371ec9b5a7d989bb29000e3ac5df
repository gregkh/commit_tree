libceph: support raw data requests

Allow osd request ops that aren't otherwise structured (not class,
extent, or watch ops) to specify "raw" data to be used to hold
incoming data for the op.  Make use of this capability for the osd
STAT op.

Prefix the name of the private function osd_req_op_init() with "_",
and expose a new function by that (earlier) name whose purpose is to
initialize osd ops with (only) implied data.

For now we'll just support the use of a page array for an osd op
with incoming raw data.
