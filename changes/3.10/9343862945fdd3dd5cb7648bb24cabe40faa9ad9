cgroup: convert cgroupfs_root flag bits to masks and add CGRP_ prefix

There's no reason to be using bitops, which tends to be more
cumbersome, to handle root flags.  Convert them to masks.  Also, as
they'll be moved to include/linux/cgroup.h and it's generally a good
idea, add CGRP_ prefix.

Note that flags are assigned from (1 << 1).  The first bit will be
used by a flag which will be added soon.
