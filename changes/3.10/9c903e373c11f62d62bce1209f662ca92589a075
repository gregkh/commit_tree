Bluetooth: l2cap: introduce l2cap_conn ref-counting

If we want to use l2cap_conn outside of l2cap_core.c, we need refcounting
for these objects. Otherwise, we cannot synchronize l2cap locks with
outside locks and end up with deadlocks.

Hence, introduce ref-counting for l2cap_conn objects. This doesn't affect
l2cap internals at all, as they use a direct synchronization.
We also keep a reference to the parent hci_conn for locking purposes as
l2cap_conn depends on this. This doesn't affect the connection itself but
only the lifetime of the (dead) object.
