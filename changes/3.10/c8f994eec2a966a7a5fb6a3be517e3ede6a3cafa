mac80211: purge remain-on-channel items when suspending

They can't really be executed while suspended and could
trigger work warnings, so abort all ROC items. When the
system resumes the notifications about this will be
delivered to userspace which can then act accordingly
(though it will assume they were canceled/finished.)
