s390/mm,gmap: implement gmap_translate()

Implement gmap_translate() function which translates a guest absolute address
to a user space process address without establishing the guest page table

This is useful for kvm guest address translations where no memory access
is expected to happen soon (e.g. tprot exception handler).
