Revert "USB: chipidea: add vbus detect for udc"

There are several problems with this patch:
  + in introduces a sparse warning for a condition that's always negative,
  + and because of that, it actually doesn't do anything useful,
  + and vbus detection belongs to otg, not device function anyway.

This reverts commit 8c4fc031954b4eb72daf13d3c907a985a3eee208.
