mmc: dw_mmc: setpower on MMC_POWER_{UP,OFF}

Call the setpower platform callback in response to set_ios with
ios->power_mode == MMC_POWER_UP or MMC_POWER_OFF, instead of from the
card detect work function.

This appears to fix a problem I have where a card stuck in a funny state
doesn't get properly cleared by the power being turned off, presumably
due to lack of power sequencing. This resulted in the following log
messages after boot:
