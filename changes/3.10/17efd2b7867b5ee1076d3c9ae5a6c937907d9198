tty: serial/samsung: prepare for common clock API

With the common clock interface, there is no way to provide the
"clock_source" sysfs attribute for the samsung serial ports. Given that
this file was purely informational and had fixed contents, we have reason
to believe that no user space programs were relying on it.

The sysfs file is not documented in the ABI docs.
