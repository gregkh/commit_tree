fcoe: Use correct API to set vlan tag for FCoE Ethertype skbs

fcoe_xmit was coded such that it would skip the vlan net device/layer
and instead set some vlan flags and transmit on the real net device.
The real net device has code that would add the vlan tag for fcoe skbs.
This avoids some extra processing for data frames and provides a small
performance improvement.

Since fcoe_xmit was not using the vlan net device, __vlan_put_tag
within the real net device's xmit routine was ultimately being
called to set the vlan tag.

With the below change the behavior of __vlan_put_tag changed slightly,
it now sets the skb->protocol = vlan_proto. vlan_proto was not a field
being set by fcoe_xmit, so the skb->protocol is now not being set to
ETH_P_8021Q, as it should be.

This patch converts fcoe_xmit to use the vlan_put_tag routine which
will tag the skb and fcoe will continue to transmit fcoe skbs on the
real net device.

For reference, the below change was the one that altered the
__vlan_put_tag behavior.

      net: vlan: add protocol argument to packet tagging functions

      Add a protocol argument to the VLAN packet tagging functions. In case of HW
      tagging, we need that protocol available in the ndo_start_xmit functions,
      so it is stored in a new field in the skb. The new field fits into a hole
      (on 64 bit) and doesn't increase the sks's size.
