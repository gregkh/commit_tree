irqchip: armada-370-xp: slightly cleanup irq controller driver

In preparation for the introduction of MSI support in the IRQ

additional defines for the manipulation of doorbells. Just like IPIs
are implemented using doorbells, MSIs will also use doorbells, so it
makes sense to do this preparatory cleanup first.
