ASoC: mxs: Embed the mxs_dma_data struct in the mxs_pcm_dma_params struct

Currently the mxs_dma_data struct, which gets passed to the dmaengine driver, is
allocated in the pcm driver's open callback. The mxs_dma_data struct has exactly
one field which is initialized from the the same field in the mxs_pcm_dma_params
struct. The mxs_pcm_dma_params struct gets passed to the pcm driver from the dai
driver. Instead of taking this indirection embed the mxs_dma_data struct
directly in the mxs_pcm_dma_params struct. This allows us to simplify the pcm
driver quite a bit, since we don't have to care about memory managing the
mxs_dma_data struct anymore.
