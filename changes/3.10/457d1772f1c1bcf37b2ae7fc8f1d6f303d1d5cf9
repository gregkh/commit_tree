uprobes/tracing: Generalize struct uprobe_trace_entry_head

struct uprobe_trace_entry_head has a single member for reporting,
"unsigned long ip". If we want to support uretprobes we need to
create another struct which has "func" and "ret_ip" and duplicate
a lot of functions, like trace_kprobe.c does.

To avoid this copy-and-paste horror we turn ->ip into ->vaddr[]
and add couple of trivial helpers to calculate sizeof/data. This
uglifies the code a bit, but this allows us to avoid a lot more
complications later, when we add the support for ret-probes.
