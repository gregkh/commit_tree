drm/i915: handle walking compact dma scatter lists

So far the assumption was that each dma scatter list entry contains only
a single page. This might not hold in the future, when we'll introduce
compact scatter lists, so prepare for this everywhere in the i915 code
where we walk such a list.

We'll fix the place _creating_ these lists separately in the next patch
to help the reviewing/bisectability.
