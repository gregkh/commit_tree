btrfs: abort unlink trans in missed error case

__btrfs_unlink_inode() aborts its transaction when it sees errors after
it removes the directory item.  But it missed the case where
btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log() returns an error.  If this happens then
the unlink appears to fail but the items have been removed without
updating the directory size.  The directory then has leaked bytes in
i_size and can never be removed.

Adding the missing transaction abort at least makes this failure
consistent with the other failure cases.

I noticed this while reading the code after someone on irc reported
having a directory with i_size but no entries.  I tested it by forcing
btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log() to return -ENOMEM.
