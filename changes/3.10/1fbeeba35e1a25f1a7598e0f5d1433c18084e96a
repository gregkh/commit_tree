block: remove refs to XD disks from documentation

Commit d1a6f4f19728d6e90480e53601a90fc9f6a348ad
"block: delete super ancient PC-XT driver for 1980's hardware"
deleted the XD disk driver, but there are still a few
references to it in the documentation directory. Delete
the remnants and thus also free up the major block device
13 for reuse.
