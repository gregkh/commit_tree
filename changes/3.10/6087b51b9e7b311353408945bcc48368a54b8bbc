rbd: rename __rbd_add_snap_dev()

Rename __rbd_add_snap_dev() to be rbd_snap_create().  We no longer
have devices for non-mapped snapshots, and we're not actually
"adding" it to the list in this function, just creating it.

Rename rbd_remove_snap_dev() to be rbd_snap_destroy() for reasons
similar to the above.  Stop having this function delete the snapshot
from its list (to be symmetrical with its create counterpart) and do
that in the caller instead.
