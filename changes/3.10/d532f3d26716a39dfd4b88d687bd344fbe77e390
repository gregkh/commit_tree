MIPS: Allow ASID size to be determined at boot time.

Original patch by Ralf Baechle and removed by Harold Koerfgen
with commit f67e4ffc79905482c3b9b8c8dd65197bac7eb508. This
allows for more generic kernels since the size of the ASID
and corresponding masks can be determined at run-time. This
patch is also required for the new Aptiv cores and has been
tested on Malta and Malta Aptiv platforms.
