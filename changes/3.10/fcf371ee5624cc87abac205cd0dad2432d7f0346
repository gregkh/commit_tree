regulator: core: Add regulator_map_voltage_ascend() API

A lot of regulator hardware has ascendant voltage list.
This patch adds regulator_map_voltage_ascend() and export it.

Drivers that have ascendant voltage list can use this as their map_voltage()
operation, this is more efficient than default regulator_map_voltage_iterate()
function.
