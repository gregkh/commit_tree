usb: phy: nop: Add some parameters to platform data

Add clk_rate parameter to platform data. If supplied, the
NOP phy driver will program the clock to that rate during probe.

Also add 2 flags, needs_vcc and needs_reset.
If the flag is set and the regulator couldn't be found
then the driver will bail out with -EPROBE_DEFER.
