i2c: Add bus recovery infrastructure

Add i2c bus recovery infrastructure to i2c adapters as specified in the i2c
protocol Rev. 03 section 3.1.16 titled "Bus clear".

Sometimes during operation i2c bus hangs and we need to give dummy clocks to
slave device to start the transfer again. Now we may have capability in the bus
controller to generate these clocks or platform may have gpio pins which can be
toggled to generate dummy clocks. This patch supports both.

This patch also adds in generic bus recovery routines gpio or scl line based
which can be used by bus controller. In addition controller driver may provide
its own version of the bus recovery routine.

This doesn't support multi-master recovery for now.
