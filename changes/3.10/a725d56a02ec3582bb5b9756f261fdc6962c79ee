KVM: Introduce CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQ_ROUTING

Quite a bit of code in KVM has been conditionalized on availability of
IOAPIC emulation. However, most of it is generically applicable to
platforms that don't have an IOPIC, but a different type of irq chip.

Make code that only relies on IRQ routing, not an APIC itself, on
CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQ_ROUTING, so that we can reuse it later.
