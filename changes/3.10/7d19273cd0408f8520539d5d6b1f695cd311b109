ARC: [TB10x] Remove redundant abilis,simple-pinctrl mechanism

The TB10x platform port includes a custom mechanism using to set up
default pin controller configurations using abilis,simple-default
pin configurations of nodes compatible with abilis,simple-pinctrl. This
mechanism is redundant with the Linux standard "default" pin
configuration, see commit ab78029ecc347debbd737f06688d788bd9d60c1d
"drivers/pinctrl: grab default handles from device core".
This patch removes the TB10x custom mechanism in favour of the Linux
standard.
