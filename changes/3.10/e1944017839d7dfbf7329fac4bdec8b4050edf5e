USB: fix latency in uhci-hcd and ohci-hcd

Commits c44b225077bb1fb25ed5cd5c4f226897b91bedd4 (UHCI: implement new
semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP) and
6a41b4d3fe8cd4cc95181516fc6fba7b1747a27c (OHCI: implement new
semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP) increased the latency for isochronous URBs
in uhci-hcd and ohci-hcd respectively to 2 milliseconds, in an
attempt to avoid underruns.  It turns out that not only was this
unnecessary -- 1-ms latency works okay -- it also causes problems with
certain application loads such as real-time audio.

This patch changes the latency for both drivers back to 1 ms.

This should be applied to -stable kernels going back to 3.8.
