clk: Add composite clock type

Not all clocks are required to be decomposed into basic clock
types but at the same time want to use the functionality
provided by these basic clock types instead of duplicating.

For example, Tegra SoC has ~100 clocks which can be decomposed
into Mux -> Div -> Gate clock types making the clock count to
~300. Also, parent change operation can not be performed on gate
clock which forces to use mux clock in driver if want to change
the parent.

Instead aggregate the basic clock types functionality into one
clock and just use this clock for all operations. This clock
type re-uses the functionality of basic clock types and not
limited to basic clock types but any hardware-specific
implementation.
