USB: EHCI: convert singly-linked lists to list_heads

This patch (as1664) converts ehci-hcd's async_unlink, async_iaa, and
intr_unlink from singly-linked lists to standard doubly-linked
list_heads.  Originally it didn't seem necessary to use list_heads,
because items are always added to and removed from these lists in FIFO
order.  But now with more list processing going on, it's easier to use
the standard routines than continue with a roll-your-own approach.

I don't know if the code ends up being notably shorter, but the
patterns will be more familiar to any kernel hacker.
