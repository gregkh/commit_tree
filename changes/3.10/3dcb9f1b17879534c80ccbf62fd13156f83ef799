ARM: OMAP3: remove cpuidle_wrap_enter

In a previous commit the en_core_tk_irqen flag has been added but we missed
the cpuidle_wrap_enter which was doing the job to measure the time for the
'omap3_enter_idle' function.

Actually, I don't see any reason to use this wrapper in the code. In the better
case, the time computation is not correctly done because of the different
operations done in omap3_enter_idle_bm which were not taken into account
before the en_core_tk_irqen flag was set.

As the time is reflected for the state overridden by the omap3_enter_idle_bm,
using the wrapper is pointless now, so removing it.
