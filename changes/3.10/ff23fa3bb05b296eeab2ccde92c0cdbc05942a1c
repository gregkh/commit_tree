spi/omap-mcspi: check condition also after timeout

It is possible that the handler gets interrupted after checking the
status. After it resumes the time out is due but the condition it was
waiting for might be true as well. Therefore it is necessary to check
the condition in case of an time out to be sure that the condition is
not true after the time passed by.
