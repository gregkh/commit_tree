libceph: don't clear bio_iter in prepare_write_message()

At one time it was necessary to clear a message's bio_iter field to
avoid a bad pointer dereference in write_partial_msg_pages().

That no longer seems to be the case.  Here's why.

The message's bio fields represent (in this case) outgoing data.
Between where the bio_iter is made NULL in prepare_write_message()
and the call in that function to prepare_message_data(), the
bio fields are never used.

In prepare_message_data(), init-bio_iter() is called, and the result
of that overwrites the value in the message's bio_iter field.

Because it gets overwritten anyway, there is no need to set it to
NULL.  So don't do it.
