ARC: [mm] optimise icache flush for kernel mappings

This change continues the theme from prev commit - this time icache
handling for kernel's own code modification (vmalloc: loadable modules,
breakpoints for kprobes/kgdb...)

flush_icache_range() calls the CDU icache helper with vaddr to enable
exact line invalidate.

For a true kernel-virtual mapping, the vaddr is actually virtual hence
valid as index into cache. For kprobes breakpoint however, the vaddr arg
is actually paddr - since that's how normal kernel is mapped in ARC
memory map.  This implies that CDU will use the same addr for
indexing as for tag match - which is fine since kernel code would only
have that "implicit" mapping and none other.

This should speed up module loading significantly - specially on default
ARC700 icache configurations (32k) which alias.
