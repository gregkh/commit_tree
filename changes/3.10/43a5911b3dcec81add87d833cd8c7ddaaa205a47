regulator: ab8500: Clean out SoC registers

Clean out initialisation that is handled by SoC. Regulator
settings for Vpll (partly), Vsmps1, Vsmps2, Vsmps3 (partly),
Vrf1, Varm, Vape, Vbb, Vmod are cleaned out. They should not
be touched by the kernel.

We also update many of the initialisation values to be more
in-line with the current development efforts of ST-Ericsson
internal engineers.
