ARM: imx: enable RBC to support anatop LPM mode

RBC is to control whether some ANATOP sub modules
can enter lpm mode when SOC is into STOP mode, if
RBC is enabled and PMIC_VSTBY_REQ is set, ANATOP
will have below behaviors:

1. Digital LDOs(CORE, SOC and PU) are bypassed;
2. Analog LDOs(1P1, 2P5, 3P0) are disabled;

As the 2P5 is necessary for DRAM IO pre-drive in
STOP mode, so we need to enable weak 2P5 in STOP
mode when 2P5 LDO is disabled.

For RBC settings, there are some rules as below
due to hardware design:

1. All interrupts must be masked during operating
   RBC registers;
2. At least 2 CKIL(32K) cycles is needed after the
   RBC setting is changed.
