ARM: tegra: add APB DMA nodes to Tegra114 DT

NVIDIA's Tegra114 has 32 channels APB DMA controller. Add DT entry for
APB DMA controllers and make it compatible with "nvidia,tegra114-apbdma".

Tegra114 DMA controller is not compatible with Tegra30/Tegra20 DMA
controller driver as in Tegra114, the global pause also clock gate the
DMA register and hence it iw not possible to write the DMA register
with global pause.
