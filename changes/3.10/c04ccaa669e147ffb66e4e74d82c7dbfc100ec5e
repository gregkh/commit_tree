drbd: read meta data early, base on-disk offsets on super block

We used to calculate all on-disk meta data offsets, and then compare
the stored offsets, basically treating them as magic numbers.

Now with the activity log striping, the activity log size is no longer
fixed.  We need to first read the super block, then base the activity
log and bitmap offsets on the stored offsets/al stripe settings.
