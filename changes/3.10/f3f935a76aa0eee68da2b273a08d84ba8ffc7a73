crypto: camellia - add AVX2/AES-NI/x86_64 assembler implementation of camellia cipher

Patch adds AVX2/AES-NI/x86-64 implementation of Camellia cipher, requiring
32 parallel blocks for input (512 bytes). Compared to AVX implementation, this
version is extended to use the 256-bit wide YMM registers. For AES-NI
instructions data is split to two 128-bit registers and merged afterwards.
Even with this additional handling, performance should be higher compared
to the AES-NI/AVX implementation.
