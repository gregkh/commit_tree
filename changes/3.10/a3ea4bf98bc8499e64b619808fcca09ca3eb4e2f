[media] em28xx: add support for em25xx i2c bus B read/write/check device operations

The webcam "SpeedLink VAD Laplace" (em2765 + ov2640) uses a special algorithm
for i2c communication with the sensor, which is connected to a second i2c bus.
We don't know yet how to find out which devices support/use it.
It's very likely used by all em25xx and em276x+ bridges.
Tests with other em28xx chips (em2820, em2882/em2883) show, that this
algorithm always succeeds there although no slave device is connected.
The algorithm likely also works for real i2c client devices (OV2640 uses SCCB),
because the Windows driver seems to use it for probing Samsung and Kodak
sensors.
