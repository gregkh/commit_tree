staging: zcache: zero-filled pages awareness

Compression of zero-filled pages can unneccessarily cause internal
fragmentation, and thus waste memory. This special case can be
optimized.

This patch captures zero-filled pages, and marks their corresponding
zcache backing page entry as zero-filled. Whenever such zero-filled
page is retrieved, we fill the page frame with zero.
