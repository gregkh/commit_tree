ASoC: codecs: remove hidden prompt

The Kconfig symbol SND_SOC_OF_SIMPLE got removed in commit
f0fba2ad1b6b53d5360125c41953b7afcd6deff0 ("ASoC: multi-component - ASoC
Multi-Component Support"). But that commit missed one instance. Remove
it now, together with the prompt it has effectively hidden ever since.
