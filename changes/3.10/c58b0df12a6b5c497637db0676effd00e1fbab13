nohz: Select VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN from full dynticks config

Turn the full dynticks passive dependency on VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN
to an active one.

The full dynticks Kconfig is currently hidden behind the full dynticks
cputime accounting, which is an awkward and counter-intuitive layout:
the user first has to select the dynticks cputime accounting in order
to make the full dynticks feature to be visible.

We definetly want it the other way around. The usual way to perform
this kind of active dependency is use "select" on the depended target.
Now we can't use the Kconfig "select" instruction when the target is
a "choice".

So this patch inspires on how the RCU subsystem Kconfig interact
with its dependencies on SMP and PREEMPT: we make sure that cputime
accounting can't propose another option than VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN
when NO_HZ_FULL is selected by using the right "depends on" instruction
for each cputime accounting choices.

v2: Keep full dynticks cputime accounting available even without
full dynticks, as per Paul McKenney's suggestion.
