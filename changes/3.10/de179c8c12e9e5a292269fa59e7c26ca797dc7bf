netlink: have length check of rtnl msg before deref

When the legacy array rtm_min still exists, the length check within
these functions is covered by rtm_min[RTM_NEWTFILTER],
rtm_min[RTM_NEWQDISC] and rtm_min[RTM_NEWTCLASS].

But after Thomas Graf removed rtm_min several days ago, these checks
are missing. Other doit functions should be OK.
