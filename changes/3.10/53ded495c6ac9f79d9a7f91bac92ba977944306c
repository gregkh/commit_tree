libceph: define mds_alloc_msg() method

The only user of the ceph messenger that doesn't define an alloc_msg
method is the mds client.  Define one, such that it works just like
it did before, and simplify ceph_con_in_msg_alloc() by assuming the
alloc_msg method is always present.

This and the next patch resolve:
