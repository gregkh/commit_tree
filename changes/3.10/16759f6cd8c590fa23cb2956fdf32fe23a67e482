tty: Document unsafe ldisc reference acquire

Merge get_ldisc() into its only call site.
Note how, after merging, the unsafe acquire of an ldisc reference
is obvious.

   CPU 0 in tty_ldisc_try()         |  CPU 1 in tty_ldisc_halt()
                                    |
test_bit(TTY_LDISC, &tty_flags)     |
if (true)                           |  clear_bit(TTY_LDISC, &tty_flags)
  tty->ldisc != 0?                  |  atomic_read(&tty->ldisc->users)
  if (true)                         |  ret_val == 1?
    atomic_inc(&tty->ldisc->users)  |  if (false)
                                    |    wait
                                    |
<goes on assuming safe ldisc use>   |  <doesn't wait - proceeds w/ close>
                                    |

The spin lock in tty_ldisc_try() does nothing wrt synchronizing
the ldisc halt since it's not acquired as part of halting.
