TTY: add tty_port_tty_wakeup helper

It allows for cleaning up on a considerable amount of places. They did
port_get, wakeup, kref_put. Now the only thing needed is to call
tty_port_tty_wakeup which does exactly that.

One exception is ifx6x60 where tty_wakeup was open-coded. We now call
tty_wakeup properly there.
