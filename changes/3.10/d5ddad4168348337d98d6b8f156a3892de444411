target: Propigate up ->cmd_kref put return via transport_generic_free_cmd

Go ahead and propigate up the ->cmd_kref put return value from
target_put_sess_cmd() -> transport_release_cmd() -> transport_put_cmd()
-> transport_generic_free_cmd().

This is useful for certain fabrics when determining the active I/O
shutdown case with SCF_ACK_KREF where a final target_put_sess_cmd()
is still required by the caller.
