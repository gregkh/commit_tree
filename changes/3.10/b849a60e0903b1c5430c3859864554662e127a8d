ARM: make cr_alignment read-only #ifndef CONFIG_CPU_CP15

This makes cr_alignment a constant 0 to break code that tries to modify
the value as it's likely that it's built on wrong assumption when
CONFIG_CPU_CP15 isn't defined. For code that is only reading the value 0
is more or less a fine value to report.
