efivarfs: Move to fs/efivarfs

Now that efivarfs uses the efivar API, move it out of efivars.c and
into fs/efivarfs where it belongs. This move will eventually allow us
to enable the efivarfs code without having to also enable
CONFIG_EFI_VARS built, and vice versa.

Furthermore, things like,

    mount -t efivarfs none /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

will now work if efivarfs is built as a module without requiring the
use of MODULE_ALIAS(), which would have been necessary when the
efivarfs code was part of efivars.c.
