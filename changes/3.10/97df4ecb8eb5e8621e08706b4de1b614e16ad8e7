staging: ti-soc-thermal: report alert events on OMAP5 devices

OMAP5430 devices have the capability to generate
alert temperature. Thus, whenever a T_ALERT IRQ is served,
the ti-bandgap will call .report_temperature to notify the
thermal framework about thermal zone update request.

This patch allows OMAP5430 devices to notify
the thermal framework about T_ALERT events.
