tracing: Add comment for trace event flag IGNORE_ENABLE

All the trace event flags have comments but the IGNORE_ENABLE flag
which is set for ftrace internal events that should not be enabled
via the debugfs "enable" file. That is, if the top level enable file
is set, it will enable all events. It use to just check the ftrace
event call descriptor "reg" field and skip those whithout it, but now
some ftrace internal events have a reg field but still need to be
skipped. The flag was created to ignore those events.

Now document it.
