ARC: [kbuild] Avoid DTB rebuilds if DTS are untouched

Currently, for every ARC kernel build I see the following:

--------------->8-----------------
  DTB    arch/arc/boot/dts/angel4.dtb.S
  AS      arch/arc/boot/dts/angel4.dtb.o
  LD      arch/arc/boot/dts/built-in.o
rm arch/arc/boot/dts/angel4.dtb.S        <-- forces rebuild next iter
  CHK     kernel/config_data.h
--------------->8-----------------

This is because *.dts.S is intermediate file in dtb generation and is by
default deleted by make which needs a ".SECONDARY" hint to NOT do so.

This could have ideally been done in scripts/Makefile.lib - for benefit
of all, however .SECONDARY doesn't seem to work with wildcards.

Thanks to Stephen for suggesting .SECONDARY (vs .PRECIOUS) and making
that work using a non wildcard version in arch makefile.

Thanks to James Hogan for pointing out that *.dtb.S now needs to be
added to clean-files
