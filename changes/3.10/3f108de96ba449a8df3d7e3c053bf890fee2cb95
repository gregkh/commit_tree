parisc: memory overflow, 'name' length is too short for using

'path.bc[i]' can be asigned by PCI_SLOT() which can '> 10', so sizeof(6
* "%u:" + "%u" + '\0') may be 21.

Since 'name' length is 20, it may be memory overflow.

And 'path.bc[i]' is 'unsigned char' for printing, we can be sure the
max length of 'name' must be less than 28.

So simplify thinking, we can use 28 instead of 20 directly, and do not
think of whether 'patchc.bc[i]' can '> 100'.
