xfs: shortform directory offsets change for dir3 format

Because the header size for the CRC enabled directory blocks is
larger, the offset of the first entry into a directory block is
different to the dir2 format. The shortform directory stores the
dirent's offset so that it doesn't change when moving from shortform
to block form and back again, and hence it needs to take into
account the different header sizes to maintain the correct offsets.
