ray_cs: read past the end of the array

"translate" should either be set or disabled.  We also use it an
offset into the framing[] array when we're generating the proc
file.  Framing looks like this:

static const char *framing[] = { "Encapsulation", "Translation" }

So when we're setting translate we need to restrict the values to
either 1 or 0 or it can an out of bounds read.
