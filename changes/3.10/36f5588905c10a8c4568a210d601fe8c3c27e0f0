aio: refcounting cleanup

The usage of ctx->dead was fubar - it makes no sense to explicitly check
it all over the place, especially when we're already using RCU.

Now, ctx->dead only indicates whether we've dropped the initial
refcount. The new teardown sequence is:

  set ctx->dead
  hlist_del_rcu();
  synchronize_rcu();

Now we know no system calls can take a new ref, and it's safe to drop
the initial ref:

  put_ioctx();

We also need to ensure there are no more outstanding kiocbs.  This was
done incorrectly - it was being done in kill_ctx(), and before dropping
the initial refcount.  At this point, other syscalls may still be
submitting kiocbs!

Now, we cancel and wait for outstanding kiocbs in free_ioctx(), after
kioctx->users has dropped to 0 and we know no more iocbs could be
submitted.
