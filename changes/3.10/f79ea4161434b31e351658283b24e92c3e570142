block: Refactor blk_update_request()

Converts it to use bio_advance(), simplifying it quite a bit in the
process.

Note that req_bio_endio() now always calls bio_advance() - which means
it always loops over the biovec, not just on partial completions. Don't
expect it to affect performance, but worth noting.

Tested it by forcing partial updates, and dumping before and after on
various bio/bvec fields when doing a partial update.
