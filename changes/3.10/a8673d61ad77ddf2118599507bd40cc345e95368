ceph: use I_COMPLETE inode flag instead of D_COMPLETE flag

commit c6ffe10015 moved the flag that tracks if the dcache contents
for a directory are complete to dentry. The problem is there are
lots of places that use ceph_dir_{set,clear,test}_complete() while
holding i_ceph_lock. but ceph_dir_{set,clear,test}_complete() may
sleep because they call dput().

This patch basically reverts that commit. For ceph_d_prune(), it's
called with both the dentry to prune and the parent dentry are
locked. So it's safe to access the parent dentry's d_inode and
clear I_COMPLETE flag.
