rbd: zero format 1 header structure earlier

The passed-in header structure is zeroed in rbd_header_from_disk().
Instead, have the caller do it.  Note that there are two callers,
rbd_dev_v1_refresh() and rbd_dev_v1_probe().  The latter already has
a zeroed header structure so zeroing it isn't necessary there.
