bnx2x: correct reading of speed capabilities

When the bnx2x driver reads the port configuration - mask irrelevant bits.

Without this change, the unintended bits may cause the driver to needlessly
toggle the link, as a comparison in the link flap avoidance flow will show
that the old link did not advertise the same capabilities and thus cannot
be retained.
