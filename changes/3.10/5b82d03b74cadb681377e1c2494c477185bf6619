clk: ux500: Add support for sysctrl clocks

The abx500 sysctrl clocks are using the ab8500 sysctrl driver to
modify the clock hardware. Sysctrl clocks are represented by a
ab8500 sysctrl register and with a corresponding bitmask.

The sysctrl clocks are slow path clocks, which means clk_prepare
and clk_unprepare will be used to gate|ungate these clocks.
