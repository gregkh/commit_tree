batman-adv: reorder clean up routine in order to avoid race conditions

nc_worker accesses the originator table during its periodic
work, but since the originator table is freed before
stopping the worker this leads to a global protection fault.

Fix this by killing the worker (in nc_free) before freeing
the originator table.

Moreover tidy up the entire clean up routine by running all
the subcomponents freeing procedures first and then killing
the TT and the originator tables at the end.
