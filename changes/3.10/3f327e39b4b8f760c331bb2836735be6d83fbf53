PCI: acpiphp: Re-enumerate devices when host bridge receives Bus Check

When a PCI host bridge device receives a Bus Check notification, we
must re-enumerate starting with the bridge to discover changes (devices
that have been added or removed).

Prior to 668192b678 ("PCI: acpiphp: Move host bridge hotplug to
pci_root.c"), this happened in _handle_hotplug_event_bridge().  After that
commit, _handle_hotplug_event_bridge() is not installed for host bridges,
and the host bridge notify handler, _handle_hotplug_event_root() did not
re-enumerate.

This patch adds re-enumeration to _handle_hotplug_event_root().

This fixes cases where we don't notice the addition or removal of
PCI devices, e.g., the PCI-to-USB ExpressCard in the bugzilla below.
