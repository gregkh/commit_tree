ftrace: Have ftrace_regex_write() return either read or error

As ftrace_regex_write() reads the result of ftrace_process_regex()
which can sometimes return a positive number, only consider a
failure if the return is negative. Otherwise, it will skip possible
other registered probes and by returning a positive number that
wasn't read, it will confuse the user processes doing the writing.
