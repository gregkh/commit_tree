xfs: add CRC checks to block format directory blocks

Now that directory buffers are made from a single struct xfs_buf, we
can add CRC calculation and checking callbacks. While there, add all
the fields to the on disk structures for future functionality such
as d_type support, uuids, block numbers, owner inode, etc.

To distinguish between the different on disk formats, change the
magic numbers for the new format directory blocks.
