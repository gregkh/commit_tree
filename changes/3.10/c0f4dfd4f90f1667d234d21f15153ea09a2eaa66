rcu: Make RCU_FAST_NO_HZ take advantage of numbered callbacks

Because RCU callbacks are now associated with the number of the grace
period that they must wait for, CPUs can now take advance callbacks
corresponding to grace periods that ended while a given CPU was in
dyntick-idle mode.  This eliminates the need to try forcing the RCU
state machine while entering idle, thus reducing the CPU intensiveness
of RCU_FAST_NO_HZ, which should increase its energy efficiency.
