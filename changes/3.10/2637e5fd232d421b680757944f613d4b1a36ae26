i2c: octeon: Fix i2c fail problem when a process is terminated by a signal

I've been debugging the abnormal operation of i2c on octeon. If a process is
terminated by signal in the middle of i2c operation, next i2c read operation
which is done by another process was failed. So i changed to ignore signal in
the middle of i2c operation. After that the problem was not reproduced.
