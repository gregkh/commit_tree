ALSA: hda - VIA prefers side surrounds over HP

The recent fix for the independent HP reduced the availability of the
side surround output, because there are only 4 DACs for 7.1 and a HP
outputs.  Adjust the badness tables for VIA so that 7.1 outputs are
activated for the cost of missing independent HP.

Once when we implement the dynamic DAC switching to multiple outputs,
this conflicts will be eased in future...
