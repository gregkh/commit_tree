staging: comedi: ni_65xx: use the pci id_table 'driver_data'

Create an enum to the boardinfo and pass that enum in the pci_driver
id_table as the driver_data.

Change the macro used to fill in the device table from PCI_DEVICE() to
PCI_VDEVICE(). This allows passing the enum as the next field.

This allows removing the 'dev_id' data from the boardinfo as well the
search function that was used to locate the boardinfo for the PCI device.

Since we now have a local variable in the attach that has the boardinfo
pointer, use that instead of calling the local board() helper function
each time the boardinfo is accessed.
