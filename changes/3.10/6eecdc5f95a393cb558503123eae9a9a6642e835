usbnet: allow status interrupt URB to always be active

Some drivers (sierra_net) need the status interrupt URB
active even when the device is closed, because they receive
custom indications from firmware.  Add functions to refcount
the status interrupt URB submit/kill operation so that
sub-drivers and the generic driver don't fight over whether
the status interrupt URB is active or not.

A sub-driver can call usbnet_status_start() at any time, but
the URB is only submitted the first time the function is
called.  Likewise, when the sub-driver is done with the URB,
it calls usbnet_status_stop() but the URB is only killed when
all users have stopped it.  The URB is still killed and
re-submitted for suspend/resume, as before, with the same
refcount it had at suspend.
