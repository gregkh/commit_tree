    rt2800: use BBP_R1 for setting tx power

unfortunately does not work well with RT5390 and RT3290 chips as they
require different temperature compensation TX power settings (TSSI
tuning). Since that commit make wireless connection very unstable on
those chips, restore previous behavior to fix regression. Once we
implement proper TSSI tuning on 5390/3290 we can restore back setting
TX power by BBP_R1 register for those chips.
