irqchip: gic: call gic_cpu_init() as well in CPU_STARTING_FROZEN case

Commit c011470 (irqchip: gic: Perform the gic_secondary_init() call via
CPU notifier) moves gic_secondary_init() that used to be called in
.smp_secondary_init hook into a notifier call.  But it changes the
system behavior a little bit.  Before the commit, gic_cpu_init()
is called not only when kernel brings up the secondary cores but also
when system resuming procedure hot-plugs the cores back to kernel.
While after the commit, the function will not be called in the latter
case, where the 'action' will not be CPU_STARTING but
CPU_STARTING_FROZEN.  This behavior difference at least causes the
following suspend/resume regression on imx6q.

Fix the regression by checking 'action' being CPU_STARTING_FROZEN to
have gic_cpu_init() called for secondary cores when system resumes.
