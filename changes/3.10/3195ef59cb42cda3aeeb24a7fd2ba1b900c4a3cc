x86: Do full rtc synchronization with ntp

Every 11 minutes ntp attempts to update the x86 rtc with the current
system time.  Currently, the x86 code only updates the rtc if the system
time is within +/-15 minutes of the current value of the rtc. This
was done originally to avoid setting the RTC if the RTC was in localtime
mode (common with Windows dualbooting).  Other architectures do a full
synchronization and now that we have better infrastructure to detect
when the RTC is in localtime, there is no reason that x86 should be
software limited to a 30 minute window.

This patch changes the behavior of the kernel to do a full synchronization
(year, month, day, hour, minute, and second) of the rtc when ntp requests
a synchronization between the system time and the rtc.

I've used the RTC library functions in this patchset as they do all the
required bounds checking.
