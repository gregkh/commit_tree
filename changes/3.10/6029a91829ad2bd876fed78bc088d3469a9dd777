workqueue: add workqueue->unbound_attrs

Currently, when exposing attrs of an unbound workqueue via sysfs, the
workqueue_attrs of first_pwq() is used as that should equal the
current state of the workqueue.

The planned NUMA affinity support will make unbound workqueues make
use of multiple pool_workqueues for different NUMA nodes and the above
assumption will no longer hold.  Introduce workqueue->unbound_attrs
which records the current attrs in effect and use it for sysfs instead
of first_pwq()->attrs.
