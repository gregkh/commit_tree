usb: storage: Convert US_DEBUGP to usb_stor_dbg

Use a more current logging style with dev_printk
where possible.

o Convert uses of US_DEBUGP to usb_stor_dbg
o Add "struct us_data *" to usb_stor_dbg uses
o usb_stor_dbg now uses struct device */dev_vprint_emit
o Removed embedded function names
o Coalesce formats
o Remove trailing whitespace
o Remove useless OOM messages
o Remove useless function entry/exit logging
o Convert some US_DEBUGP uses to dev_info and dev_dbg

Object size is slightly reduced when debugging
is enabled, slightly increased with no debugging
because some initialization and removal messages
are now always emitted.
