PCI: acpiphp: Remove all functions even if function 0 doesn't exist

Currently function disable_device() detects slot state by checking
existence of PCI function 0.  It's unreliable because the PCI device
for function 0 may be removed through the sysfs interface.  If that
happens, it will cause powering off a hotplug slot without destroying
all PCI devices.

On the other hand, it won't hurt us except wasting some computation
power if the check is removed, because all code of disable_device()
is self-protected.  So remove the check.
