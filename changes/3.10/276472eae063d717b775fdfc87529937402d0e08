ipvs: remove rs_lock by using RCU

rs_lock was used to protect rs_table (hash table)
from updaters (under global mutex) and readers (packet handlers).
We can remove rs_lock by using RCU lock for readers. Reclaiming
dest only with kfree_rcu is enough because the readers access
only fields from the ip_vs_dest structure.

Use hlist for rs_table.

As we are now using hlist_del_rcu, introduce in_rs_table
flag as replacement for the list_empty checks which do not
work with RCU. It is needed because only NAT dests are in
the rs_table.
