perf/x86: Add flags to event constraints

This patch adds a flags field to each event constraint.
It can be used to store event specific features which can
then later be used by scheduling code or low-level x86 code.

The flags are propagated into event->hw.flags during the
get_event_constraint() call. They are cleared during the
put_event_constraint() call.

This mechanism is going to be used by the PEBS-LL patches.
It avoids defining yet another table to hold event specific
information.
