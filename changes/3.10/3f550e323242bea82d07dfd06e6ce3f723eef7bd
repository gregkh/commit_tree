ALSA: hda - Allow to change I/O direction in hp/mic jack mode ctl

The previous commits added the capability to change the pin control of
hp/mic shared jack, but it actually didn't work as expected when the
value is changed from the output to the input, since I forgot to reset
the pin I/O bit in that case.  This patch fixes the problem.
