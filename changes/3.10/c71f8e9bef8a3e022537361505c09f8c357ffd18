ARM: OMAP2+: Detect incorrectly aligned GPMC base address

Each GPMC chip-select can be configured to map 16MB, 32MB, 64MB or 128MB
of address space. The physical base address where a chip-select starts
is also configurable and must be aligned on a boundary that is equal to
or greater than the size of the address space mapped bt the chip-select.
When enabling a GPMC chip-select, ensure that the base address is aligned
to the appropriate boundary.
