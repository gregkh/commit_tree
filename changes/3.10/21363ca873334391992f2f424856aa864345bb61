target/file: Fix off-by-one READ_CAPACITY bug for !S_ISBLK export

This patch fixes a bug where FILEIO was incorrectly reporting the number
of logical blocks (+ 1) when using non struct block_device export mode.

It changes fd_get_blocks() to follow all other backend ->get_blocks() cases,
and reduces the calculated dev_size by one dev->dev_attrib.block_size
number of bytes, and also fixes initial fd_block_size assignment at
fd_configure_device() time introduced in commit 0fd97ccf4.
