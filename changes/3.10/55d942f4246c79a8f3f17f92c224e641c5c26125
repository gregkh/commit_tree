mac80211: restrict peer's VHT capabilities to own

Implement restricting peer VHT capabilities to the device's own
capabilities. This is useful when a single driver supports more
than one device and the devices have different capabilities
(often they will differ in the number of spatial streams), but
in particular is also necessary for VHT capability overrides to
work correctly -- otherwise it'd be possible to e.g. advertise,
due to overrides, that TX-STBC is not supported, but then still
use it to TX to the AP because it supports RX-STBC.
