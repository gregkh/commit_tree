net/macb: fix ISR clear-on-write behavior only for some SoC

Commit 749a2b6 (net/macb: clear tx/rx completion flags in ISR)
introduces clear-on-write on ISR register. This behavior is not always
implemented when using Cadence MACB/GEM and is breaking other platforms.
We are using the Design Configuration Register 1 information and a capability
property to actually activate this clear-on-write behavior on ISR.
