MIPS: sead3: Use generic suspend/resume for LEDs.

Setting the LED_CORE_SUSPENDRESUME flag causes the LED driver core to call
led_classdev_suspend/led_classdev_resume during suspend/resume. Since this is
exactly what the driver's custom suspend/resume callbacks do we can replace them
by setting the LED_CORE_SUSPENDRESUME flag.
