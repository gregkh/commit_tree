libceph: slightly defer registering osd request

One of the first things ceph_osdc_start_request() does is register
the request.  It then acquires the osd client's map semaphore and
request mutex and proceeds to map and send the request.

There is no reason the request has to be registered before acquiring
the map semaphore.  So hold off doing so until after the map
semaphore is held.

Since register_request() is nothing more than a wrapper around
__register_request(), call the latter function instead, after
acquiring the request mutex.

That leaves register_request() unused, so get rid of it.

This partially resolves:
