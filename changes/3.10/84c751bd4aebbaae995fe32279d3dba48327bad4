ptrace: add ability to retrieve signals without removing from a queue (v4)

This patch adds a new ptrace request PTRACE_PEEKSIGINFO.

This request is used to retrieve information about pending signals
starting with the specified sequence number.  Siginfo_t structures are
copied from the child into the buffer starting at "data".

The argument "addr" is a pointer to struct ptrace_peeksiginfo_args.
struct ptrace_peeksiginfo_args {
	u64 off;	/* from which siginfo to start */
	u32 flags;
	s32 nr;		/* how may siginfos to take */
};

"nr" has type "s32", because ptrace() returns "long", which has 32 bits on
i386 and a negative values is used for errors.

Currently here is only one flag PTRACE_PEEKSIGINFO_SHARED for dumping
signals from process-wide queue.  If this flag is not set, signals are
read from a per-thread queue.

The request PTRACE_PEEKSIGINFO returns a number of dumped signals.  If a
signal with the specified sequence number doesn't exist, ptrace returns
zero.  The request returns an error, if no signal has been dumped.

Errors:
EINVAL - one or more specified flags are not supported or nr is negative
EFAULT - buf or addr is outside your accessible address space.

A result siginfo contains a kernel part of si_code which usually striped,
but it's required for queuing the same siginfo back during restore of
pending signals.

This functionality is required for checkpointing pending signals.  Pedro
Alves suggested using it in "gdb" to peek at pending signals.  gdb already
uses PTRACE_GETSIGINFO to get the siginfo for the signal which was already
dequeued.  This functionality allows gdb to look at the pending signals
which were not reported yet.

The prototype of this code was developed by Oleg Nesterov.
