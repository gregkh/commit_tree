staging: ti-soc-thermal: split writable data from readonly data

This patch changes the data structures of this driver so
that readonly data can reside only in the conf pointer.
Now each register has a struct to hold its configuration info,
to be used base on chip version for instance, and a
struct of values to be written, like register shadow and priv data.
