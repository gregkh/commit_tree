perf tools: Add support for weight v7 (modified)

perf record has a new option -W that enables weightened sampling.

Add sorting support in top/report for the average weight per sample and the
total weight sum. This allows to both compare relative cost per event
and the total cost over the measurement period.

Add the necessary glue to perf report, record and the library.

v2: Merge with new hist refactoring.
v3: Fix manpage. Remove value check.
Rename global_weight to weight and weight to local_weight.
v4: Readd sort keys to manpage
v5: Move weight to end
v6: Move weight to template
v7: Rename weight key.

Original patch from Andi modified by Stephane Eranian <eranian@google.com>
to include ONLY the weight supporting code and apply to pristine 3.8.0-rc4.
