perf: net_dropmonitor: Fix symbol-relative addresses

The comparison between traced and symbol addresses is backwards: if
the traced address doesn't exactly match a symbol (which we don't
expect it to), we'll show the next symbol and the offset to it,
whereas we should show the previous symbol and the offset from it.
