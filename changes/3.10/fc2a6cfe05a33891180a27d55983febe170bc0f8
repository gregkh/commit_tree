powerpc: Fix interrupt range check on debug exception

We do not want to take single step and branch-taken debug exception
in kernel exception code. But the address range check was not covering
all kernel exception handlers address range.

With this patch we defined the interrupt_end label which defines the
end on kernel exception code. So now we check interrupt_base to
interrupt_end range for not handling debug exception in kernel
exception entry.
