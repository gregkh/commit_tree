PCI/ACPI: Handle PCI slot devices when creating/destroying PCI buses

Currently the pci_slot driver doesn't update PCI slot devices when PCI
device hotplug event happens, which may cause memory leak and returning
stale information to user.

Now the pci_slot driver has been changed as built-in driver, so invoke
PCI slot enumeration and destroy routines directly from the PCI core.
And remove ACPI PCI sub-driver related code because it isn't needed
any more.
