jfs: Several bugs in jfs_freeze() and jfs_unfreeze()

The mentioned functions do not pay attention to the error codes returned
by the functions updateSuper(), lmLogInit() and lmLogShutdown(). It brings
to system crash later when writing to log.

The patch adds corresponding code to check and return the error codes
and to print correct error messages in case of errors.
