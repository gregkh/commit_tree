tracing: Add internal ftrace trace_puts() for ftrace to use

There's a few places that ftrace uses trace_printk() for internal
use, but this requires context (normal, softirq, irq, NMI) buffers
to keep things lockless. But the trace_puts() does not, as it can
write the string directly into the ring buffer. Make a internal helper
for trace_puts() and have the internal functions use that.

This way the extra context buffers are not used.
