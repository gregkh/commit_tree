slab: Common kmalloc slab index determination

Extract the function to determine the index of the slab within
the array of kmalloc caches as well as a function to determine
maximum object size from the nr of the kmalloc slab.

This is used here only to simplify slub bootstrap but will
be used later also for SLAB.
