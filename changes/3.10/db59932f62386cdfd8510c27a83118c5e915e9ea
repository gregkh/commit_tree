metag: perf: fixes for interrupting perf counters

The overflow handler needs to read modify write when re-enabling the
counter so as not to change the counter value as it may have been
changed to ready the next interrupt on overflow. Similarly for
interrupting counters metag_pmu_enable_counter needs to leave the
counter value unchanged rather than resetting it to zero.
