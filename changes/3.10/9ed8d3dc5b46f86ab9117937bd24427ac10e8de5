[SCSI] scsi_debug: call map_region() and unmap_region() only when needed

If the logical block provisioning is not enabled, map_region() and
unmap_region() have no effect and they don't need to be called.

So this makes map_region() and unmap_region() to be called only
when scsi_debug_lbp() returns true, i.e. logical block provisioning is
enabled.

While I'm at it, this also removes meaningless non-zero check for
scsi_debug_unmap_granularity.

Because scsi_debug_unmap_granularity cannot be zero with usual setting:
scsi_debug_unmap_granularity is 1 by default, and it can be changed to
zero with explicit module parameter setting only when the logical block
provisioning is disabled.  But it is only meaningful module parameter
when the logical block provisioning is enabled.
