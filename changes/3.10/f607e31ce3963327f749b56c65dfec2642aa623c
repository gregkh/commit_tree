ASoC: arizona: Fix interaction between headphone outputs and identification

Running HPDET while the headphone outputs are enabled can disrupt the
operation of HPDET. In order to avoid this HPDET needs to disable the
headphone outputs and ASoC needs to not enable them while HPDET is
running.

Do the ASoC side of this by storing the enable state in the core driver
structure and only writing to the device if a flag indicating that the
accessory detection side is in a state where it can have the headphone
output stage enabled.
