drivers/video/backlight/platform_lcd.c: introduce probe callback

Platform LCD devices may need to do some device-specific initialization
before they can be used (regulator or GPIO setup, for example), but
currently the driver does not support any way of doing this.  This patch
adds a probe() callback to plat_lcd_data which platform LCD devices can
set to indicate that device-specific initialization is needed.
