mfd: Add ChromeOS EC implementation

This is the base EC implementation, which provides a high level
interface to the EC for use by the rest of the kernel. The actual
communcations is dealt with by a separate protocol driver which
registers itself with this interface.

Interrupts are passed on through a notifier.

A simple message structure is used to pass messages to the
protocol driver.
