mmc: mmci: Move ios_handler functionality into the driver

There are currently two instances of the ios_handler being used.
Both of which mearly toy with some regulator settings. Now there
is a GPIO regulator API, we can use that instead, and lessen the
per platform burden. By doing this, we also become more Device
Tree compatible.
