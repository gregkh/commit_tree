vfs: Fix invalid ida_remove() call

When the group id of a shared mount is not allocated, the umount still
tries to call mnt_release_group_id(), which eventually hits a kernel
warning at ida_remove() spewing a message like:
  ida_remove called for id=0 which is not allocated.

This patch fixes the bug simply checking the group id in the caller.
