x86, gdt, hibernate: Store/load GDT for hibernate path.

The git commite7a5cd063c7b4c58417f674821d63f5eb6747e37
("x86-64, gdt: Store/load GDT for ACPI S3 or hibernate/resume path
is not needed.") assumes that for the hibernate path the booting
kernel and the resuming kernel MUST be the same. That is certainly
the case for a 32-bit kernel (see check_image_kernel and
CONFIG_ARCH_HIBERNATION_HEADER config option).

However for 64-bit kernels it is OK to have a different kernel
version (and size of the image) of the booting and resuming kernels.
Hence the above mentioned git commit introduces an regression.

This patch fixes it by introducing a 'struct desc_ptr gdt_desc'
back in the 'struct saved_context'. However instead of having in the
'save_processor_state' and 'restore_processor_state' the
store/load_gdt calls, we are only saving the GDT in the
save_processor_state.

For the restore path the lgdt operation is done in
hibernate_asm_[32|64].S in the 'restore_registers' path.

The apt reader of this description will recognize that only 64-bit
kernels need this treatment, not 32-bit. This patch adds the logic
in the 32-bit path to be more similar to 64-bit so that in the future
the unification process can take advantage of this.
