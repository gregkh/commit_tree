n_tty: Fix stuck throttled driver

As noted in the following comment:

  /* FIXME: there is a tiny race here if the receive room check runs
     before the other work executes and empties the buffer (upping
     the receiving room and unthrottling. We then throttle and get
     stuck. This has been observed and traced down by Vincent Pillet/
     We need to address this when we sort out out the rx path locking */

Use new safe throttle/unthrottle functions to re-evaluate conditions
if interrupted by the complement flow control function.
