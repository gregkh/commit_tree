drm: Kill user_modes list and the associated ioctls

There is no way to use modes added to the user_modes list. We never
look at the contents of said list in the kernel, and the only operations
userspace can do are attach and detach. So the only "benefit" of this
interface is wasting kernel memory.

Fortunately it seems no real user space application ever used these
ioctls. So just kill them.

Also remove the prototypes for the non-existing drm_mode_addmode_ioctl()
and drm_mode_rmmode_ioctl() functions.

v2: Use drm_noop instead of completely removing the ioctls
