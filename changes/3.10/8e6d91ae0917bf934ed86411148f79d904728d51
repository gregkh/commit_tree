tuntap: forbid changing mq flag for persistent device

We currently allow changing the mq flag (IFF_MULTI_QUEUE) for a persistent
device. This will result a mismatch between the number the queues in netdev and
tuntap. This is because we only allocate a 1q netdevice when IFF_MULTI_QUEUE was
not specified, so when we set the IFF_MULTI_QUEUE and try to attach more queues
later, netif_set_real_num_tx_queues() may fail which result a single queue
netdevice with multiple sockets attached.

Solve this by disallowing changing the mq flag for persistent device.

Bug was introduced by commit edfb6a148ce62e5e19354a1dcd9a34e00815c2a1
(tuntap: reduce memory using of queues).
