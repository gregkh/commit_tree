ARM: Push selects for TWD/SCU into machine entries

The TWD and SCU configs are selected by default as long as
MSM_SCORPIONMP is false and/or MCT is false. Implementing the
logic this way certainly saves lines in the Kconfig but it
precludes those machines which select MSM_SCORPIONMP or MCT from
participating in the single zImage effort because when those
machines are combined with other SMP capable machines the TWD and
SCU are no longer selected by default.

Push the select out to the machine entries so that we can compile
these machines together and still select the appropriate configs.
