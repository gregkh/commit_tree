sfc: Fix replacement detection in efx_filter_insert_filter()

efx_filter_insert_filter() uses the first table entry in the hash chain
that either has the same match values or is empty.  This means that
replacement doesn't always work correctly:

1. Insert filter F1 with match values M1, hashing to H1, at first
   possible entry E1.
2. Insert filter F2 with match values M2, hashing to H1, at second
   possible entry E2.
3. Remove filter F1.
4. Insert filter F3 with match values M2, hashing to H1, at first
   possible entry E1.

F3 should have either replaced F2 or been rejected (depending on
priority and the replace_equal parameter).

Instead, search for both a matching filter that the inserted filter
would replace, and an available insertion point, up to the applicable
maximum search depths.  If we insert at lower depth than a replaced
filter, clear the replaced filter.
