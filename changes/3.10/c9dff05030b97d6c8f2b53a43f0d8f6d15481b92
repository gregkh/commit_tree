ARM: shmobile: Add second I/O range for r8a7790 PFC

Add the GPIO I/O memory range to the r8a7790 PFC device.

This extra I/O memory range is needed when using the PFC
tables to drive both pin functions (using PINCTRL or
function GPIO for old code) and actual GPIO. The goal is
however to use a separate GPIO driver in the long run
and when that happens this extra I/O memory range can
be removed.
