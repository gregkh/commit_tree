netfilter: nf_log: prepare net namespace support for loggers

This patch adds netns support to nf_log and it prepares netns
support for existing loggers. It is composed of four major
changes.

1) nf_log_register has been split to two functions: nf_log_register
   and nf_log_set. The new nf_log_register is used to globally
   register the nf_logger and nf_log_set is used for enabling
   pernet support from nf_loggers.

   Per netns is not yet complete after this patch, it comes in
   separate follow up patches.

2) Add net as a parameter of nf_log_bind_pf. Per netns is not
   yet complete after this patch, it only allows to bind the
   nf_logger to the protocol family from init_net and it skips
   other cases.

3) Adapt all nf_log_packet callers to pass netns as parameter.
   After this patch, this function only works for init_net.

4) Make the sysctl net/netfilter/nf_log pernet.
