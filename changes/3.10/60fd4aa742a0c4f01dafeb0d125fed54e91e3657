USB: EHCI: reorganize ehci_iaa_watchdog()

This patch (as1635) rearranges the control-flow logic in
ehci_iaa_watchdog() slightly to agree better with the comments.  It
also changes a verbose-debug message to a regular debug message.
Expiration of the IAA watchdog is an unusual event and can lead to
problems; we need to know about it if it happens during debugging.  It
should not be necessary to set a "verbose" compilation option.

No behavioral changes other than the debug message.  Lots of apparent
changes to the source text, though, because the indentation level was
decreased.
