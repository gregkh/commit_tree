sata_rcar: fix interrupt handling

The driver's interrupt handling code is too picky in deciding whether it should
handle an interrupt or not which causes completely unneeded spurious interrupts.
Thus make sata_rcar_{ata|serr}_interrupt() *void*; add ATA status register read
to sata_rcar_ata_interrupt() to clear an unexpected ATA interrupt -- it doesn't
get cleared by writing to the SATAINTSTAT register in the interrupt mode we use.

Also, in sata_rcar_ata_interrupt() we should check SATAINTSTAT register only for
enabled interrupts and we should clear  only those interrupts  that we have read
as active first time around, because else we have  a  race and risk clearing  an
interrupt that  can  occur between read  and write of the  SATAINTSTAT  register
and never registering it...
