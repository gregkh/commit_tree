HID: use hid_hw_request() instead of direct call to usbhid

This allows the hid drivers to be independent from the transport layer.

The patch was constructed by replacing all occurences of
usbhid_submit_report() by its hid_hw_request() counterpart.
Then, drivers not requiring USB_HID anymore have their USB_HID
dependency cleaned in the Kconfig file.

Finally, few drivers still depends on USB_HID. Many of them
are requiring the io wait callback. They are found in the next patch.
