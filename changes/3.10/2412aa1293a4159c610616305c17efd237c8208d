ia64: Make sure interrupts enabled when we "safe_halt()"

In commit d166991234347215dc23fc9dc15a63a83a1a54e1
   idle: Implement generic idle function
Thomas Gleixner cleaned up many things but perturbed some
fragile code that was keeping ia64 alive. So we started
seeing:
   WARNING: at kernel/cpu/idle.c:94 cpu_idle_loop+0x360/0x380()
and other unpleasantness like system hangs during boot.

We really shouldn't ever halt with interrupts disabled.
