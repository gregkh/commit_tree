direct-io: submit bio after boundary buffer is added to it

Currently, dio_send_cur_page() submits bio before current page and cached
sdio->cur_page is added to the bio if sdio->boundary is set.  This is
actually wrong because sdio->boundary means the current buffer is the last
one before metadata needs to be read.  So we should rather submit the bio
after the current page is added to it.
