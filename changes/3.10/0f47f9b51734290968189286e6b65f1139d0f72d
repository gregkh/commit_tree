KVM: extend EMULATE_EXIT_USER to support different exit reasons

Currently the instruction emulator code returns EMULATE_EXIT_USER
and common code initializes the "run->exit_reason = .." and
"vcpu->arch.hcall_needed = .." with one fixed reason.
But there can be different reasons when emulator need to exit
to user space. To support that the "run->exit_reason = .."
and "vcpu->arch.hcall_needed = .." initialization is moved a
level up to emulator.
