dmatest: cancel thread immediately when asked for

If user have the timeout alike issues and wants to cancel the thread
immediately, the current call of wait_event_freezable_timeout is preventing to
this until timeout is expired. Thus, user will experience the unnecessary
delays.

Adding kthread_should_stop() check inside wait_event_freezable_timeout() solves
that.
