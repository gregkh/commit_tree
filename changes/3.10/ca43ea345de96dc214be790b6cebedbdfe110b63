ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Add a new flag to handle SIDLE in SWSUP only in active

Some IPs (like UART) need the sidle mode to be controlled in SW only
while they are active. Once they go inactive, they need the IP to be
put back in HW control so they are also wakeup capable.

The flag HWMOD_SWSUP_SIDLE takes care of IPs which need the sidle
mode to be *always* controlled in SWSUP. We now have a need to control
IPs sidle mode in SWSUP only while its active.

So define a new flag 'HWMOD_SWSUP_SIDLE_ACT' to help the framework
know about these new IP requirements.
