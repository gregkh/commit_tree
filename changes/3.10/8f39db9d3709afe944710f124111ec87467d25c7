virtio-blk: use virtqueue_add_sgs on bio path

(This is a respin of Paolo Bonzini's patch, but it calls
virtqueue_add_sgs() instead of his multi-part API).

Move the creation of the request header and response footer to
__virtblk_add_req.  vbr->sg only contains the data scatterlist,
the header/footer are added separately using virtqueue_add_sgs().

With this change, virtio-blk (with use_bio) is not relying anymore on
the virtio functions ignoring the end markers in a scatterlist.
The next patch will do the same for the other path.
