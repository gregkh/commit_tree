input: Add ChromeOS EC keyboard driver

Use the key-matrix layer to interpret key scan information from the EC
and inject input based on the FDT-supplied key map. This driver registers
itself with the ChromeOS EC driver to perform communications.

The matrix-keypad FDT binding is used with a small addition to control
ghosting.
