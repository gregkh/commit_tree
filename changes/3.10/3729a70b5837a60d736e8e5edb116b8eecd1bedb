omapdss: Features: Fix some parameter ranges

Increase the DSS_FCLK and DSI_FCLK max supported frequencies, these come because
some frequencies were increased from OMAP5 ES1 to OMAP5 ES2. We support only
OMAP5 ES2 in the kernel, so replace the ES1 values with ES2 values. Increase the
DSI PLL Fint range, this was previously just copied from the OMAP4 param range
struct.

Fix the maximum DSS_FCLK on OMAP2, it's 133 Mhz according to the TRM.
