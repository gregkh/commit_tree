KVM: x86: remove vcpu's CPL check in host-invoked XCR set

__kvm_set_xcr function does the CPL check when set xcr. __kvm_set_xcr is
called in two flows, one is invoked by guest, call stack shown as below,

  handle_xsetbv(or xsetbv_interception)
    kvm_set_xcr
      __kvm_set_xcr

the other one is invoked by host, for example during system reset:

  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl
    kvm_vcpu_ioctl_x86_set_xcrs
      __kvm_set_xcr

The former does need the CPL check, but the latter does not.
