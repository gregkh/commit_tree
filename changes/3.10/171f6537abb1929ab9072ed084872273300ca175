Btrfs: cleanup fs roots if we fail to mount

We can run the tree logging recovery or the orphan cleanup on mount, so we'll
end up looking up a random fs tree in the meantime.  So we need to clean this up
so we don't leave extent buffers hanging around on the cache.  With this patch
we no longer leak extent buffers on failure to mount.  Thanks,
