nbd: increase default and max request sizes

Raise the default max request size for nbd to 128KB (from 127KB) to get it
4KB aligned.  This patch also allows the max request size to be increased
(via /sys/block/nbd<x>/queue/max_sectors_kb) to 32MB.

The patch makes nbd network traffic more efficient by:
- reducing request fragmentation (4KB alignment)
- reducing the number of requests (fewer round trips, less network overhead)

Especially in high latency networks, larger request size can make a dramatic
