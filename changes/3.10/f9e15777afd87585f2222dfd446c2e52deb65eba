libceph: be explicit about message data representation

A ceph message has a data payload portion.  The memory for that data
(either the source of data to send or the location to place data
that is received) is specified in several ways.  The ceph_msg
structure includes fields for all of those ways, but this
mispresents the fact that not all of them are used at a time.

Specifically, the data in a message can be in:
    - an array of pages
    - a list of pages
    - a list of Linux bios
    - a second list of pages (the "trail")
(The two page lists are currently only ever used for outgoing data.)

Impose more structure on the ceph message, making the grouping of
some of these fields explicit.  Shorten the name of the
"page_alignment" field.
