perf annotate: Cleanup disasm__calc_percent()

The loop end condition is calculated from next disasm_line or the symbol
size if it's the last disasm_line.  But it doesn't need to be calculated
at every iteration.  Moving it out of the function can simplify code a
bit.  Also the src_line doesn't need to be checked in every time.
