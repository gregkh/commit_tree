mtd: add new fields to nand_flash_dev{}

As time goes on, we begin to meet the situation that we can not get enough
information from some nand chips's id data. Take some Toshiba's nand chips
for example. I have 4 Toshiba's nand chips in my hand:
	TC58NVG2S0F, TC58NVG3S0F, TC58NVG5D2, TC58NVG6D2

When we read these chips' datasheets, we will get the geometry of these chips:
	TC58NVG2S0F : 4096 + 224
	TC58NVG3S0F : 4096 + 232
	TC58NVG5D2  : 8192 + 640
	TC58NVG6D2  : 8192 + 640

But we can not parse out the correct oob size for these chips from the id data.

This patch adds some new fields to the nand_flash_dev{}:
  @id_len: the valid length of the id data. See the comments in
           nand_id_has_period()
  @oobsize: the oob size.
