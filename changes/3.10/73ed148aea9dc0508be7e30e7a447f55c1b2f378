powerpc/powernv: Improve kexec reliability

We add a machine_shutdown hook that frees the OPAL interrupts
(so they get masked at the source and don't fire while kexec'ing)
and which triggers an IODA reset on all the PCIe host bridges
which will have the effect of blocking all DMAs and subsequent
PCIs interrupts.
