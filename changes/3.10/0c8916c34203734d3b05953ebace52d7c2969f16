tracing: Add rmdir to remove multibuffer instances

Add a method to the hijacked dentry descriptor of the
"instances" directory to allow for rmdir to remove an
instance of a multibuffer.

Example:

  cd /debug/tracing/instances
  mkdir hello
  ls
hello/
  rmdir hello
  ls

Like the mkdir method, the i_mutex is dropped for the instances
directory. The instances directory is created at boot up and can
not be renamed or removed. The trace_types_lock mutex is used to
synchronize adding and removing of instances.

I've run several stress tests with different threads trying to
create and delete directories of the same name, and it has stood
up fine.
