[SCSI] Handle MLQUEUE busy response in scsi_send_eh_cmnd

scsi_send_eh_cmnd() is calling queuecommand() directly, so
it needs to check the return value here.
The only valid return codes for queuecommand() are 'busy'
states, so we need to wait for a bit to allow the LLDD
to recover.

Based on an earlier patch from Wen Xiong.

[jejb: fix confusion between msec and jiffies values and other issues]
[bvanassche: correct stall_for interval]
