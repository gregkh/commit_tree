Bluetooth: Remove RFCOMM session refcnt

Previous commits have improved the handling of the RFCOMM session
timer and the RFCOMM session pointers such that freed RFCOMM
session structures should no longer be erroneously accessed. The
RFCOMM session refcnt now has no purpose and will be deleted by
this commit.

Note that the RFCOMM session is now deleted as soon as the
RFCOMM control channel link is no longer required. This makes the
lifetime of the RFCOMM session deterministic and absolute.
Previously with the refcnt, there was uncertainty about when
the session structure would be deleted because the relative
refcnt prevented the session structure from being deleted at will.

It was noted that the refcnt could malfunction under very heavy
real-time processor loading in embedded SMP environments. This
could cause premature RFCOMM session deletion or double session
deletion that could result in kernel crashes. Removal of the
refcnt prevents this issue.

There are 4 connection / disconnection RFCOMM session scenarios:
host initiated control link ---> host disconnected control link
host initiated ctrl link ---> remote device disconnected ctrl link
remote device initiated ctrl link ---> host disconnected ctrl link
remote device initiated ctrl link ---> remote device disc'ed ctrl link

The control channel connection procedures are independent of the
disconnection procedures. Strangely, the RFCOMM session refcnt was
applying special treatment so erroneously combining connection and
disconnection events. This commit fixes this issue by removing
some session code that used the "initiator" member of the session
structure that was intended for use with the data channels.
