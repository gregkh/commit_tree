[media] rc: winbond-cir: fix potential double free in wbcir_probe()

Since rc_unregister_device() frees its argument, the subsequently
call to rc_free_device() on the same variable will cause a double
free bug. Fix by set argument to NULL, thus when fall through to
rc_free_device(), nothing will be done there.
