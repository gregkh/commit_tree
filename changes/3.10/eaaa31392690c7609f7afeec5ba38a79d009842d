netlink: Diag core and basic socket info dumping (v2)

The netlink_diag can be built as a module, just like it's done in
unix sockets.

The core dumping message carries the basic info about netlink sockets:
family, type and protocol, portis, dst_group, dst_portid, state.

Groups can be received as an optional parameter NETLINK_DIAG_GROUPS.

Netlink sockets cab be filtered by protocols.

The socket inode number and cookie is reserved for future per-socket info
retrieving. The per-protocol filtering is also reserved for future by
requiring the sdiag_protocol to be zero.

The file /proc/net/netlink doesn't provide enough information for
dumping netlink sockets. It doesn't provide dst_group, dst_portid,
groups above 32.

v2: fix NETLINK_DIAG_MAX. Now it's equal to the last constant.
