ath9k: prevent aggregation session deadlocks

Waiting for all subframes of an existing aggregation session to drain
before allowing mac80211 to start a new one is fragile and deadlocks
caused by this behavior have been observed.

Since mac80211 has proper synchronization for aggregation session
start/stop handling, a better approach to session handling is to simply
allow mac80211 to start a new session at any time. This requires
changing the code to discard any packets outside of the BlockAck window
in the A-MPDU software retry code.

This patch implements the above and also simplifies the code.
