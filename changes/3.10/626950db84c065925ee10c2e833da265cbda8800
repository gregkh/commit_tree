sfc: Add AER and EEH support for Siena

The Linux side of EEH is triggered by MMIO reads, but this
driver's data path does not issue any MMIO reads (except in
legacy interrupt mode).  Therefore add a monitor function
to poll EEH periodically.

When preparing to reset the device based on our own error
detection, also poll EEH and defer to its recovery mechanism
if appropriate.

[bwh: Use a separate condition for the initial link poll; fix some
 style errors]
