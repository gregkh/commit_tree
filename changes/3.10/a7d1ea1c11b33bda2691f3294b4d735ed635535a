vfio-pci: Enable raw access to unassigned config space

Devices like be2net hide registers between the gaps in capabilities
and architected regions of PCI config space.  Our choices to support
such devices is to either build an ever growing and unmanageable white
list or rely on hardware isolation to protect us.  These registers are
really no different than MMIO or I/O port space registers, which we
don't attempt to regulate, so treat PCI config space in the same way.
