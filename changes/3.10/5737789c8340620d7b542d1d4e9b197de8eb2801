powerpc: Make hard_irq_disable() do the right thing vs. irq tracing

If hard_irq_disable() is called while interrupts are already soft-disabled
(which is the most common case) all is already well.

However you can (and in some cases want) to call it while everything is
enabled (to make sure you don't get a lazy even, for example before entry
into KVM guests) and in this case we need to inform the irq tracer that
the irqs are going off.

We have to change the inline into a macro to avoid an include circular
dependency hell hole.
