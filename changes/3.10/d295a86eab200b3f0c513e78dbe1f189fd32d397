i2c: mv64xxx: work around signals causing I2C transactions to be aborted

Do not use interruptible waits in an I2C driver; if a process uses
signals (eg, Xorg uses SIGALRM and SIGPIPE) then these signals can
cause the I2C driver to abort a transaction in progress by another
driver, which can cause that driver to fail.  I2C drivers are not
expected to abort transactions on signals.
