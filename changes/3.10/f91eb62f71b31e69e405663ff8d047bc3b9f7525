init: scream bloody murder if interrupts are enabled too early

As I was testing a lot of my code recently, and having several
"successes", I accidentally noticed in the dmesg this little line:

  start_kernel(): bug: interrupts were enabled *very* early, fixing it

Sure enough, one of my patches two commits ago enabled interrupts early.
The sad part here is that I never noticed it, and I ran several tests with
ktest too, and ktest did not notice this line.

What ktest looks for (and so does many other automated testing scripts) is
a back trace produced by a WARN_ON() or BUG().  As a back trace was never
produced, my buggy patch could have slipped into linux-next, or even
worse, mainline.

Adding a WARN(!irqs_disabled()) makes this bug a little more obvious:

Do you see it?

The original version of this patch just slapped a WARN_ON() in there and
kept the printk().  Ard van Breemen suggested using the WARN() interface,
which makes the code a bit cleaner.

Also, while examining other warnings in init/main.c, I found two other
locations that deserve a bloody murder scream if their conditions are hit,
and updated them accordingly.
