clocksource: mct: Add missing semicolons in exynos_mct.c

The CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE lines were added without a semicolon at the
end.  On my system this causes a compile-time error that looks like:

drivers/clocksource/exynos_mct.c:557:202: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast [enabled by default]
drivers/clocksource/exynos_mct.c:558:1: error: expected ',' or ';' before 'static'

The error didn't show up till now because there was an extra semicolon
at end of the CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE definition that was removed by
Arnd Bergmann in "clocksource: make CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE type safe"
