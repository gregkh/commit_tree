aio: make aio_read_evt() more efficient, convert to hrtimers

Previously, aio_read_event() pulled a single completion off the
ringbuffer at a time, locking and unlocking each time.  Change it to
pull off as many events as it can at a time, and copy them directly to
userspace.

This also fixes a bug where if copying the event to userspace failed,
we'd lose the event.

Also convert it to wait_event_interruptible_hrtimeout(), which
simplifies it quite a bit.
