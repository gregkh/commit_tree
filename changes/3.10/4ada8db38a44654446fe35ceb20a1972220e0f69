net: Restore NETIF_F_* bit ordering.

Commit 8ad227ff89a7 ("net: vlan: add 802.1ad support") added some new
NETIF_F_* features bits, but it added them in the middle of existing
values.

Userland depends upon the flag bits via the per-netdevice 'flags' sysfs
file.

So restore the previous ordering by adding the new flags at the end.
