mac80211: handle wide bandwidth channel switch

Parse and react to the wide bandwidth channel switch element
in beacons/action frames. Finding the element was done in a
previous patch (it has different positions in beacons/action
frames), now handle it. If there's something wrong with it
simply disconnect.
