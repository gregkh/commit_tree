clk: Restructure code for __clk_reparent

Split __clk_reparent into three pieces, one for doing the actual
reparent for updating the clock tree topology, one for the
COMMON_CLK_DEBUG code and one for doing the rate recalculation.

This patch also makes it possible to hold the spinlock over the
update of the clock tree topology, which could not be done before
when both debugfs updates and clock rate updates was done within
the same function.
