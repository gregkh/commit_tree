romfs: fix nommu map length to keep inside filesystem

Checks introduced in commit 4991e7251 ("romfs: do not use
mtd->get_unmapped_area directly") re-introduce problems fixed in the earlier
commit 2b4b2482e ("romfs: fix romfs_get_unmapped_area() argument check").

If a flat binary app is located at the end of a romfs, its page aligned
length may be outside of the romfs filesystem. The flat binary loader, via
nommu do_mmap_pgoff(), page aligns the length it is mmaping. So simple
offset+size checks will fail - returning EINVAL.

We can truncate the length to keep it inside the romfs filesystem, and that
also keeps the call to mtd_get_unmapped_area() happy.

Are there any side effects to truncating the size here though?
