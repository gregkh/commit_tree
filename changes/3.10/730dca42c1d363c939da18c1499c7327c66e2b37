KVM: x86: Rework request for immediate exit

The VMX implementation of enable_irq_window raised
KVM_REQ_IMMEDIATE_EXIT after we checked it in vcpu_enter_guest. This
caused infinite loops on vmentry. Fix it by letting enable_irq_window
signal the need for an immediate exit via its return value and drop
KVM_REQ_IMMEDIATE_EXIT.

This issue only affects nested VMX scenarios.
