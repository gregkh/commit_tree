MIPS: Netlogic: Optimize and fix write_c0_eimr()

Remove the irq save/restore from write_c0_eimr(), as it is always called
with interrupts off.

This allows us to remove workaround in write_c0_eimr() to fix up the
flags used by local_irq_save. This fixup worked on XLR, but will break
when 32-bit support is added to r2 cpus like XLP.
