ASoC: imx-pcm: Embed the imx_dma_data struct in the dma_params struct

Currently the imx_dma_data struct, which gets passed to the dmaengine driver, is
allocated and constructed in the pcm driver from the data stored in the
dma_params struct. The dma_params struct gets passed to the pcm driver from the
dai driver. Instead of going this route of indirection embed the dma_data struct
directly into the dma_params struct and let the dai driver fill it in. This
allows us to simplify the imx-pcm-dma driver quite a bit, since it doesn't have
care about memory managing the imx_dma_data struct anymore.
