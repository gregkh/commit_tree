arm: omap: board-omap3pandora: use tpo panel's gpio handling

The omap3pandora board file currently passes the reset gpio number to the
tpo-td043mtea1 panel driver via the reset_gpio field in omap_dss_device.

Platform related information should be passed via the panel driver's platform
data struct.

Add the reset gpio information to panel_tpo_td043_data so that it's passed to
the panel driver.
