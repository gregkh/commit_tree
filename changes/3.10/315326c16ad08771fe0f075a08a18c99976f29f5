tracing: Fix trace events build without modules

The new multi-buffers added a descriptor that kept track of module
events, and the directories they use, with struct ftace_module_file_ops.
This is used to add a ref count to keep modules from unloading while
their files are being accessed.

As the descriptor is only needed when CONFIG_MODULES is enabled, it
is only declared when the config is enabled. But that struct is
dereferenced in a few areas outside the #ifdef CONFIG_MODULES.

By adding some helper routines and moving code around a little,
events can be compiled again without modules.
