watchdog: Add comments to explain the watchdog_disabled variable

The watchdog_disabled flag is a bit cryptic. However it's
usefulness is multifold. Uses are:

 1. Check if smpboot_register_percpu_thread function passed.

 2. Makes sure that user enables and disables the watchdog in
    sequence i.e. enable watchdog->disable watchdog->enable watchdog
    Unlike enable watchdog->enable watchdog which is wrong.
