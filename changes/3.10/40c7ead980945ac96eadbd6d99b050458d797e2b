drm/i915: PCH_NOP

Given certain fusing options discussed in the previous patch, it's
possible to end up with platforms that normally have PCH but that PCH
doesn't actually exist. In many cases, this is easily remedied with
setting 0 pipes. This covers the other corners.

Requiring this is a symptom of improper code splitting (using
HAS_PCH_SPLIT instead of proper GEN checking, basically). I do not want
to fix this.
