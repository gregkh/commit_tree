tty: Signal foreground group processes in hangup

When the session leader is exiting, signal the foreground group
processes as part of the hangup sequence, instead of after the
hangup is complete. This prepares for hanging up the
line discipline _after_ signalling processes which
may be blocking on ldisc i/o.

Parameterize __tty_hangup() to distinguish between when the
session leader is exiting and all other hangups; signal the
foreground group after signalling the session leader and its
process group, which preserves the original signal order.
