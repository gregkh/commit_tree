OMAPDSS: picodlp panel: remove platform_enable/disable callbacks

The picodlp panel driver now manages the gpios required to configure the
panel. This was previously done in omap_dss_device's platform_enable/disable
callbacks defined in board files using this panel.

All the board files using this panel now pass the gpio information as platform
data via the panel_generic_dpi_data struct, which is needed by the panel driver
to configure the gpios connected to the panel. Hence, the
platform_enable/disable ops can be safely removed now.
