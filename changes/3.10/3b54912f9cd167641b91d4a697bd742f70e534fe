3c509.c: call SET_NETDEV_DEV for all device types (ISA/ISAPnP/EISA)

The venerable 3c509 driver only sets its device parent in one case, the ISAPnP one.
It does this with the SET_NETDEV_DEV function. It should register with the device
hierarchy in two additional cases: standard (non-PnP) ISA and EISA.

- Currently they appear here:
/sys/devices/virtual/net/eth0 (standard ISA)
/sys/devices/virtual/net/eth1 (EISA)

- Rather, they should instead be here:
/sys/devices/isa/3c509.0/net/eth0 (standard ISA)
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.0/00:04/net/eth1 (EISA)

Tested on ISA and EISA boards.
