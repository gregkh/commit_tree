cpufreq: governors: Fix CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_{INIT|EXIT} notifiers

There are two types of INIT/EXIT activities that we need to do for
governors:
 - Done only once per governor (doesn't depend how many instances of
   the governor there are). eg: cpufreq_register_notifier() for
   conservative governor.
 - Done per governor instance, eg: sysfs_{create|remove}_group().

There were some corner cases where current code isn't able to handle
them separately and so failing for some test cases.

We use two separate variables now for keeping track of above two
requirements.
 - governor->initialized for first one
 - dbs_data->usage_count for per governor instance
