ext4: fix online resizing for ext3-compat file systems

Commit fb0a387dcdc restricts block allocations for indirect-mapped
files to block groups less than s_blockfile_groups.  However, the
online resizing code wasn't setting s_blockfile_groups, so the newly
added block groups were not available for non-extent mapped files.
