idle: Enable interrupts in the weak arch_cpu_idle() implementation

PARISC bootup triggers the warning at kernel/cpu/idle.c:96. That's
caused by the weak arch_cpu_idle() implementation, which is provided
to avoid that architectures implement idle_poll over and over.

The switchover to polling mode happens in the first call of the weak
arch_cpu_idle() implementation, but that code fails to reenable
interrupts and therefor triggers the warning.

Fix this by enabling interrupts in the weak arch_cpu_idle() code.
