rbd: update capacity in rbd_dev_refresh()

When a mapped image changes size, we change the capacity recorded
for the Linux disk associated with it, in rbd_update_mapping_size().
That function is called in two places--the format 1 and format 2
refresh routines.

There is no need to set the capacity while holding the header
semaphore.  Instead, do it in the common rbd_dev_refresh(), using
the logic that's already there to initiate disk revalidation.

Add handling in the request function, just in case a request
that exceeds the capacity of the device comes in (perhaps one
that was started before a refresh shrunk the device).
