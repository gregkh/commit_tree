rbd: don't look up snapshot id in rbd_dev_mapping_set()

Currently rbd_dev_mapping_set() looks up the snapshot id for the
snapshot whose name is found in the rbd device's spec structure.

That function gets called by rbd_dev_device_setup(), which is
called by rbd_add() *after* rbd_dev_image_probe().  If the
image probe succeeds, the rbd device's spec will already have
been updated to include names and ids for all fields.

Therefore there's no need to look up the snapshot id in
rbd_dev_mapping_set().
