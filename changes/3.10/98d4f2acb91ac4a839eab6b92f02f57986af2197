ARM: Kirkwood: DT board setup for CloudBox

This patch adds DT board setup for the LaCie NAS CloudBox. The CloudBox
is a low cost NAS based on the Network Space v2.

Chipset list:
- CPU MARVELL 88F6702 1Ghz
- SDRAM memory: 256MB DDR2-800 (2x128MB x8) 400Mhz
- 1 Ethernet Gigabit port (PHY MARVELL 88E1318)
- SPI flash, NOR 512KB
- 1 push button
- 2 LEDs (red and blue)

There is no EEPROM and no USB ports embedded.

Note that this board must not be confused with the Network Space Mini v2
which is embedded in a previous LaCie product also named CloudBox.
