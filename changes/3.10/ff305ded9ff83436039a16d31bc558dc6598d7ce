tracing: Return error if register_ftrace_function_probe() fails for event_enable_func()

register_ftrace_function_probe() returns the number of functions
it registered, which can be zero, it can also return a negative number
if something went wrong. But event_enable_func() only checks for
the case that it didn't register anything, it needs to also check
for the case that something went wrong and return that error code
as well.

Added some comments about the code as well, to make it more
understandable.
