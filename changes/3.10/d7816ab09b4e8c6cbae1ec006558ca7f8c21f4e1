regulator: ab8500: Fix list_voltage for fixed voltage regulators

commit b080c78a4e447e9c212c207f725999d4e32c5f19
"regulator: ab8500: Update voltage handling for fixed voltage regulators"
removes min_uV settings and sets volt_table for all fixed voltages, thus
we can not use regulator_list_voltage_linear now. Use
regulator_list_voltage_table instead.
