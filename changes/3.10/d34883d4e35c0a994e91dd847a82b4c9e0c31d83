mm: mmu_notifier: re-fix freed page still mapped in secondary MMU

Commit 751efd8610d3 ("mmu_notifier_unregister NULL Pointer deref and
multiple ->release()") breaks the fix 3ad3d901bbcf ("mm: mmu_notifier:
fix freed page still mapped in secondary MMU").

Since hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() is changed now, we can not revert that
patch directly, so this patch reverts the commit and simply fix the bug
spotted by that patch

This bug spotted by commit 751efd8610d3 is:

    There is a race condition between mmu_notifier_unregister() and
    __mmu_notifier_release().

    Assume two tasks, one calling mmu_notifier_unregister() as a result
    of a filp_close() ->flush() callout (task A), and the other calling
    mmu_notifier_release() from an mmput() (task B).

                        A                               B
    t1                                            srcu_read_lock()
    t2            if (!hlist_unhashed())
    t3                                            srcu_read_unlock()
    t4            srcu_read_lock()
    t5                                            hlist_del_init_rcu()
    t6                                            synchronize_srcu()
    t7            srcu_read_unlock()
    t8            hlist_del_rcu()  <--- NULL pointer deref.

This can be fixed by using hlist_del_init_rcu instead of hlist_del_rcu.

The another issue spotted in the commit is "multiple ->release()
callouts", we needn't care it too much because it is really rare (e.g,
can not happen on kvm since mmu-notify is unregistered after
exit_mmap()) and the later call of multiple ->release should be fast
since all the pages have already been released by the first call.
Anyway, this issue should be fixed in a separate patch.

-stable suggestions: Any version that has commit 751efd8610d3 need to be
backported.  I find the oldest version has this commit is 3.0-stable.
