USB: io_ti: fix chars_in_buffer overhead

Use the new generic usb-serial wait_until_sent implementation to wait
for hardware buffers to drain.

This removes the need to check the hardware buffers in chars_in_buffer
and thus removes the overhead introduced by commit 263e1f9f ("USB:
io_ti: query hardware-buffer status in chars_in_buffer") without
breaking tty_wait_until_sent (used by, for example, tcdrain, tcsendbreak
and close).
