[media] m5602_ov7660: return error at ov7660_init()

It used to be a code that returns arror at ov7660_init.
However, this was removed by changeset c84e412f:

As complained by gcc:
	drivers/media/usb/gspca/m5602/m5602_ov7660.c: In function 'ov7660_init':
	drivers/media/usb/gspca/m5602/m5602_ov7660.c:99:9: warning: variable 'err' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

It should be noticed that the original error code was crappy, as it wasn't
returning any error if sensor init fails.

Fix it by returning an error if the sensor can't be initialized.
