drm/i915: check fb->pixel_format instead of bits_per_pixel

We've mostly switched over to the new more flexible schema, but
there's one check left in the modeset code.

Motivated by a question from Ville whether there's really no way an
unsupported pixel_format can escape into our platform update_plane
callbacks.

v2: Ville noticed that the fb->depth check is redudant when we already
check fb->pixel_format.
