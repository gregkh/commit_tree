staging: comedi: acl7225b: cleanup boardinfo

For aesthetic reasons, move the boardinfo table near the struct
definition. Remove the unnecessary comments in the struct definition.
Reformat the boardinfo in C99 format and add some whitespace to
help readability.

Rename the boardinfo struct and the boardinfo table so they have
namespace associated with the driver.

Remove the ACL7225_SIZE and P16R16DIO_SIZE defines. They are only
used in the boardinfo table and the open-coded values provide the
information more clearly.
