aio: use cancellation list lazily

Cancelling kiocbs requires adding them to a per kioctx linked list,
which is one of the few things we need to take the kioctx lock for in
the fast path.  But most kiocbs can't be cancelled - so if we just do
this lazily, we can avoid quite a bit of locking overhead.

While we're at it, instead of using a flag bit switch to using ki_cancel
itself to indicate that a kiocb has been cancelled/completed.  This lets
us get rid of ki_flags entirely.
