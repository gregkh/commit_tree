MN10300: Enable IRQs more in system call exit work path

Enable IRQs when calling schedule() for TIF_NEED_RESCHED and
do_notify_resume().  If interrupts are enabled during do_notify_resume(), a
warning can be seen (see lower down).

Whilst we're at it, resume_userspace can be made local to entry.S as it is not
called outside of there and it can be merged with the part of work_resched that
occurs after schedule() is called.
