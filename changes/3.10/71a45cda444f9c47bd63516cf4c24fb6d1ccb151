ASoC: Add snd_soc_{add, remove}_platform

snd_soc_{add,remove}_platform are similar to snd_soc_register_platform and
snd_soc_unregister_platform with the difference that they won't allocate and
free the snd_soc_platform structure.

Also add snd_soc_lookup_platform which looks up a platform by the device it has
been registered for.
