crypto: x86 - build AVX block cipher implementations only if assembler supports AVX instructions

These modules require AVX support in assembler, so add new check to Makefile
for this.

Other option would be to use CONFIG_AS_AVX inside source files, but that would
result dummy/empty/no-fuctionality modules being created.
