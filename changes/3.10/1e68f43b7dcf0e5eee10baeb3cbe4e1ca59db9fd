ARM: dts: omap4-panda|sdp: Fix mux for twl6030 IRQ pin and msecure line

Earlier commits ensured proper muxing of pins related to proper
TWL6030 behavior: see commit 265a2bc8 (ARM: OMAP3: TWL4030: ensure
sys_nirq1 is mux'd and wakeup enabled) and commit 1ef43369 (ARM:
OMAP4: TWL: mux sys_drm_msecure as output for PMIC).

However these only fixed legacy boot and not DT boot.  For DT boot,
the default mux values need to be set properly in DT.

Special thanks to Nishanth Menon for the review and catching some
major flaws in earlier versions.

Tested on OMAP4430/Panda and OMAP4460/Panda-ES.
