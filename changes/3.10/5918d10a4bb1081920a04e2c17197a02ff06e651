thp: fix huge zero page logic for page with pfn == 0

Current implementation of huge zero page uses pfn value 0 to indicate
that the page hasn't allocated yet.  It assumes that buddy page
allocator can't return page with pfn == 0.

Let's rework the code to store 'struct page *' of huge zero page, not
its pfn.  This way we can avoid the weak assumption.
