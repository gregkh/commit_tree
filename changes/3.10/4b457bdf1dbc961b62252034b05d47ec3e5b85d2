packet: move hw/sw timestamp extraction into a small helper

This patch introduces a small, internal helper function, that is used by
PF_PACKET. Based on the flags that are passed, it extracts the packet
timestamp in the receive path. This is merely a refactoring to remove
some duplicate code in tpacket_rcv(), to make it more readable, and to
enable others to use this function in PF_PACKET as well, e.g. for TX.
