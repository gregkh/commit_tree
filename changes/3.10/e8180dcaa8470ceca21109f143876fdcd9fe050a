ARM: KVM: prevent NULL pointer dereferences with KVM VCPU ioctl

Some ARM KVM VCPU ioctls require the vCPU to be properly initialized
with the KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT ioctl before being used with further
requests. KVM_RUN checks whether this initialization has been
done, but other ioctls do not.
Namely KVM_GET_REG_LIST will dereference an array with index -1
without initialization and thus leads to a kernel oops.
Fix this by adding checks before executing the ioctl handlers.

 [ Removed superflous comment from static function - Christoffer ]

Changes from v1:
 * moved check into a static function with a meaningful name
