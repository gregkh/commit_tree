tracing: Encapsulate global_trace and remove dependencies on global vars

The global_trace variable in kernel/trace/trace.c has been kept 'static' and
local to that file so that it would not be used too much outside of that
file. This has paid off, even though there were lots of changes to make
the trace_array structure more generic (not depending on global_trace).

Removal of a lot of direct usages of global_trace is needed to be able to
create more trace_arrays such that we can add multiple buffers.
