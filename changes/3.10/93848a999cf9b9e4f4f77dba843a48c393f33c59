xfs: add version 3 inode format with CRCs

Add a new inode version with a larger core.  The primary objective is
to allow for a crc of the inode, and location information (uuid and ino)
to verify it was written in the right place.  We also extend it by:

	a creation time (for Samba);
	a changecount (for NFSv4);
	a flush sequence (in LSN format for recovery);
	an additional inode flags field; and
	some additional padding.

These additional fields are not implemented yet, but already laid
out in the structure.

[dchinner@redhat.com] Added LSN and flags field, some factoring and rework to
capture all the necessary information in the crc calculation.
