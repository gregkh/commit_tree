be2net: fix EQ from getting full while cleaning RX CQ

While cleaning RX queues, the CQ DB may be rung several times (with rearm)
while waiting for the flush compl. Each CQ-notify with rearm can result in
an event. The EQ may get full resulting in a HW error.

Fix this by not re-arming the CQ while notifying a valid completion.
Also, there's no need to wait for 1ms after destroying RXQ, as the code in
be_rx_cq_clean() waits for the flush compl to arrive.
