xfs: split out symlink code into it's own file.

The symlink code is about to get more complicated when CRCs are
added for remote symlink blocks. The symlink management code is
mostly self contained, so move it to it's own files so that all the
new code and the existing symlink code will not be intermingled
with other unrelated code.
