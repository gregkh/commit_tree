rbd: don't destroy ceph_opts in rbd_add()

Whether rbd_client_create() successfully creates a new client or
not, it takes responsibility for getting the ceph_opts structure
it's passed destroyed.  If successful, the structure becomes
associated with the created client; if not, rbd_client_create()
will destroy it.

Previously, rbd_get_client() would call ceph_destroy_options()
if rbd_get_client() failed, and that meant it got called twice.
That led freeing various pointers more than once, which is never a
good idea.
