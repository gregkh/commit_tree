arm64: mm: Correct show_pte behaviour

show_pte makes use of the *_none_or_clear_bad style functions. If a
pgd, pud or pmd is identified as being bad, it will then be cleared.

As show_pte appears to be called from either the user or kernel
fault handlers this side effect can lead to unpredictable behaviour;
especially as TLB entries are not invalidated.

This patch removes the page table sanitisation from show_pte. If a
bad pgd, pud or pmd is encountered it is left unmodified.
