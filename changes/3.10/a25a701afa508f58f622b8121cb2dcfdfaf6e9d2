staging: comedi: ni_pcimio: use the pci id_table 'driver_data'

Create an enum to the boardinfo and pass that enum in the pci_driver
id_table as the driver_data. A couple of the entries in the boardinfo
are #if 0'ed out due to unknown device ids. Add the enums for them
also but comment them out.

Change the macro used to fill in the device table from PCI_DEVICE() to
PCI_VDEVICE(). This allows passing the enum as the next field.

This allows removing the 'device_id' data from the boardinfo as well the
search function that was used to locate the boardinfo for the PCI device.

Remove the dev_info function trace noise in the attach.

Use the boardinfo 'board' pointer instead of accessing the data directly
with the 'boardtype' macro in the attach.
