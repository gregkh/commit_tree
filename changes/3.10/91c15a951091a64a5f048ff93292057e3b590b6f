s390/hibernate: Save and restore absolute zero pages

Since commit 5f954c34 ([S390] hibernation: fix lowcore handling)
the absolute zero lowcore is lost during suspend/resume.
For example, this leads to the problem that the re-IPL device
for kdump is no longer set after resume.

With this patch during suspend a buffer is allocated in the new PM
notifier "suspend_pm_cb" and then the absolute zero lowcore is saved
to that buffer. The resume code then copies back this buffer to
absolute zero and afterwards the PM notifier releases the memory.
