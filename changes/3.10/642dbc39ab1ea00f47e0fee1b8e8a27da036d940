sched: Fix wrong rq's runnable_avg update with rt tasks

The current update of the rq's load can be erroneous when RT
tasks are involved.

The update of the load of a rq that becomes idle, is done only
if the avg_idle is less than sysctl_sched_migration_cost. If RT
tasks and short idle duration alternate, the runnable_avg will
not be updated correctly and the time will be accounted as idle
time when a CFS task wakes up.

A new idle_enter function is called when the next task is the
idle function so the elapsed time will be accounted as run time
in the load of the rq, whatever the average idle time is. The
function update_rq_runnable_avg is removed from idle_balance.

When a RT task is scheduled on an idle CPU, the update of the
rq's load is not done when the rq exit idle state because CFS's
functions are not called. Then, the idle_balance, which is
called just before entering the idle function, updates the rq's
load and makes the assumption that the elapsed time since the
last update, was only running time.

As a consequence, the rq's load of a CPU that only runs a
periodic RT task, is close to LOAD_AVG_MAX whatever the running
duration of the RT task is.

A new idle_exit function is called when the prev task is the
idle function so the elapsed time will be accounted as idle time
in the rq's load.
