tracing: Add "uptime" trace clock that uses jiffies

Add a simple trace clock called "uptime" for those that are
interested in the uptime of the trace. It uses jiffies as that's
the safest method, as other uptime clocks grab seq locks, which could
cause a deadlock if taken from an event or function tracer.
