ceph: use i_release_count to indicate dir's completeness

Current ceph code tracks directory's completeness in two places.
ceph_readdir() checks i_release_count to decide if it can set the
I_COMPLETE flag in i_ceph_flags. All other places check the I_COMPLETE
flag. This indirection introduces locking complexity.

This patch adds a new variable i_complete_count to ceph_inode_info.
Set i_release_count's value to it when marking a directory complete.
By comparing the two variables, we know if a directory is complete
