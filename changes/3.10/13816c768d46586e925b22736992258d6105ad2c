virtio_ring: virtqueue_add_sgs, to add multiple sgs.

virtio_scsi can really use this, to avoid the current hack of copying
the whole sg array.  Some other things get slightly neater, too.

This causes a slowdown in virtqueue_add_buf(), which is implemented as
a wrapper.  This is addressed in the next patches.
