e1000e: fix scheduling while atomic bugs

The previous commit ce43a2168c59bc47b5f0c1825fd5f9a2a9e3b447 (e1000e:
cleanup USLEEP_RANGE checkpatch checks) converted a number of delays and
sleeps as recommended in ./Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt.
Unfortunately, a few of the udelay() to usleep_range() conversions are in
code paths that are in an atomic context in which usleep_range() should
not be used.  Revert those specific changes.
