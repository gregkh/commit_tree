proc: Supply a function to remove a proc entry by PDE

Supply a function (proc_remove()) to remove a proc entry (and any subtree
rooted there) by proc_dir_entry pointer rather than by name and (optionally)
root dir entry pointer.  This allows us to eliminate all remaining pde->name
accesses outside of procfs.
