video: mxsfb: Introduce regulator support

Instead of using a custom binding for retrieving the GPIO that activates the
LCD from devicetree, use a standard regulator.

This approach has the advantage to be more generic.

For example: in the case of a board that has a PMIC supplying the LCD voltage,
the current approach would not work, as it only searches for a GPIO pin.
