regulator: ab8500: Separate regulator and MFD platform data

The ab8500 MFD should not have knowledge about regulator-
specific platform data like number of regulators and
regulator registers. As the regulator platform data is
about to grow with external regulators, this information
is moved to a new structure provided by the regulator
driver.
