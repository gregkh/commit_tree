xfs: push rounddown_pow_of_two() to after prealloc throttle

The round down occurs towards the beginning of the function. Push
it down after throttling has occurred. This is to support adding
further transformations to 'alloc_blocks' that might not preserve
power-of-two alignment (and thus could lead to rounding down
multiple times).
