clk: add si5351 i2c common clock driver

This patch adds a common clock driver for Silicon Labs Si5351a/b/c
i2c programmable clock generators. Currently, the driver does not
support VXCO feature of si5351b. Passing platform_data or DT bindings
selectively allows to overwrite stored Si5351 configuration which is
very helpful for clock generators with empty eeprom configuration.
Corresponding device tree binding documentation is also added.
