virtio-blk: use virtqueue_add_sgs on req path

(This is a respin of Paolo Bonzini's patch, but it calls
virtqueue_add_sgs() instead of his multi-part API).

This is similar to the previous patch, but a bit more radical
because the bio and req paths now share the buffer construction
code.  Because the req path doesn't use vbr->sg, however, we
need to add a couple of arguments to __virtblk_add_req.

We also need to teach __virtblk_add_req how to build SCSI command
requests.
