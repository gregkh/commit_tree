s390/ftrace: fix mcount adjustment

Tony Jones reported that the ftrace self tests on s390 do not work:

<6>Testing dynamic ftrace ops #1: (0 0 0 0 0) FAILED!
<6>Testing tracer irqsoff:
<3>failed to start irqsoff tracer
<4>.. no entries found ..FAILED!
<6>Testing tracer wakeup:
<3>failed to start wakeup tracer
<4>.. no entries found ..FAILED!
<6>Testing tracer function_graph:
<4>Failed to init function_graph tracer, init returned -19
<4>FAILED!

This happens because we forgot to adjust the instruction pointer that gets
passed to the ftrace trace function by MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE.

In addition change MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE to the correct value on 31 bit.
It only worked so far because the to be patched instruction was identical.
