stmmac: start adding pcs and rgmii core irq

This patch starts adding in the main ISR the management of the PCS and
RGMII/SGMII core interrupts. This is to help further development
on this area. Currently the core irq handler only clears the
PCS and S-R_MII interrupts and reports the event in the ethtool stats.
