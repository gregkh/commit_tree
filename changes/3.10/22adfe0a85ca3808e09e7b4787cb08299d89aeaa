cxgb4: Add T5 write combining support

This patch implements a low latency Write Combining (aka Write Coalescing) work
request path. PCIE maps User Space Doorbell BAR2 region writes to the new
interface to SGE. SGE pulls a new message from PCIE new interface and if its a
coalesced write work request then pushes it for processing. This patch copies
coalesced work request to memory mapped BAR2 space.
