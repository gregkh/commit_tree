xen-netfront: reduce gso_max_size to account for max TCP header

The maximum packet including header that can be handled by netfront / netback
wire format is 65535. Reduce gso_max_size accordingly.

Drop skb and print warning when skb->len > 65535. This can 1) save the effort
to send malformed packet to netback, 2) help spotting misconfiguration of
netfront in the future.
