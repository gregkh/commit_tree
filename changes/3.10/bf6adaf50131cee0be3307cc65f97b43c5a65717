Docs: Add a tips section to REPORTING-BUGS.

Lots of grumpy maintainers would love to have annoying newbies and
disorganized bug reporters read Eric S. Raymond's "How To Ask Questions
The Smart Way".  Simon Tatham's "How to Report Bugs Effectively" is also
relevant.

It's likely no one will bother to read these, but it does give
maintainers something to point to.
