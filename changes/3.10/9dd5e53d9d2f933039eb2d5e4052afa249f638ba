extcon: arizona: Retry HPDET identification for high impedance

Sometimes we can trigger measurements early if contacts are shorted during
a slow insertion. As well as debouncing add further robustness by retrying
if we get a high impedance measurement for headphones as this can indicate
that the headphones were not yet connected.
