ARM: Kirkwood: TS219: Fix crash by double PCIe instantiation

When creating the DT based boards-ts219.c the none DT ts219-setup.c
was used as a template. This includes a lateinit() call to initialize
the PCIe bus. The code makes use of machine_is_ts219() which is never
true on DT, so a FIXME was added and the code left as is. This was
unproblematic until b73690c8f8b5d: "ARM: Kirkwood: Support basic
hotplug for PCI-E" which changes the way the PCIe bus is
initialized. The non-DT ts219-setup.c now crashes during boot.  The
lateinit() call in the DT boards-ts219.c is being called,
machine_is_ts219() is true and so the PCIe is initialized a second
time.

This patch removes the useless, and now clearly dangerous, code from
boards-ts219.c, making ts219-setup.c work again.
