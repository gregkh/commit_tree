md: never update metadata when array is read-only.

Normally we don't even try to update the metadata if
the array is read-only.  However future patches
will increase the number of things that can happen on a read-only
array, so it is safest to explicitly disable this.

Every time that mddev->ro is set to 0, either
 - md_update_sb will be called again (at least if MD_CHANGE_DEVS
   is set) or
 - the mddev->thread is scheduled, which will also run
   md_update_sb if needed.

So this is safe: if the array ever become read-write the
metadata will be updated.
