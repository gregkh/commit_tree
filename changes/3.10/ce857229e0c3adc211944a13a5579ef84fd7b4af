ipc: fix GETALL/IPC_RM race for sysv semaphores

We can step on WARN_ON_ONCE() in sem_getref() if a semaphore is removed
just as we are about to call sem_getref() from semctl_main(); results
are not pretty.

We should fail with -EIDRM, same as if IPC_RM happened while we'd been
doing allocation there.  This also expands sem_getref() at its only
callsite (and fixed there), while sem_getref_and_unlock() is simply
killed off - it has no callers at all.
