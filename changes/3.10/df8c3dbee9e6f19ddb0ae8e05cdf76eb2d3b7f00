extcon: arizona: Fix interaction between headphone outputs and identification

Running HPDET while the headphone outputs are enabled can disrupt the
operation of HPDET. In order to avoid this HPDET needs to disable the
headphone outputs and ASoC needs to not enable them while HPDET is
running.

For extcon instead of checking if the headphone output is enabled when
doing magic application unconditionally disable the output and restore
the state which ASoC wants set when undoing the magic.
