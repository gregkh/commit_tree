include/linux/memory.h: implement register_hotmemory_notifier()

When CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=n, we don't want the memory-hotplug notifier
handlers to be included in the .o files, for space reasons.

The existing hotplug_memory_notifier() tries to handle this but testing
with gcc-4.4.4 shows that it doesn't work - the hotplug functions are
still present in the .o files.

So implement a new register_hotmemory_notifier() which is a copy of
register_hotcpu_notifier(), and which actually works as desired.
hotplug_memory_notifier() and register_memory_notifier() callsites
should be converted to use this new register_hotmemory_notifier().

While we're there, let's repair the existing hotplug_memory_notifier():
it simply stomps on the register_memory_notifier() return value, so
well-behaved code cannot check for errors.  Apparently non of the
existing callers were well-behaved :(
