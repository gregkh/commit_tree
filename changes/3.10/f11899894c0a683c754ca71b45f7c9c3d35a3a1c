clocksource: add samsung pwm timer driver

This adds a new clocksource driver for the PWM timer that is
present in most Samsung SoCs, based on the existing driver in
arch/arm/plat-samsung/samsung-time.c and many changes implemented by
Tomasz Figa.

Originally, the conversion of all Samsung machines to the new driver was
planned for 3.10, but that work ended up being too late and too invasive
just before the merge window.

Unfortunately, other changes in the Exynos platform resulted in some
Exynos4 setups, particularly the Universal C210 board to be broken. In
order to fix that with minimum risk, so we now leave the existing pwm
clocksource driver in place for all older platforms and use the new
driver only for device tree enabled boards. This way, we can get the
broken machines running again using DT descriptions.

All clocksource changes were implemented by Tomasz, while the DT
registration was rewritten by Arnd.
