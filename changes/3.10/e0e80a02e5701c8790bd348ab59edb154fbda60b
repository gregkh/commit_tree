cpuset: use rebuild_sched_domains() in cpuset_hotplug_workfn()

In cpuset_hotplug_workfn(), partition_sched_domains() is called without
hotplug lock held, which is actually needed (stated in the function
header of partition_sched_domains()).

This patch tries to use rebuild_sched_domains() to solve the above
issue, and makes the code looks a little simpler.
