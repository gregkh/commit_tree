perf stat: Refactor aggregation code

Refactor aggregation code by introducing a single aggr_mode variable and an
enum for aggregation.

Also refactor cpumap code having to do with cpu to socket mappings. All in
preparation for extended modes, such as cpu -> core.

Also fix socket aggregation and ensure that sockets are printed in increasing
order.
