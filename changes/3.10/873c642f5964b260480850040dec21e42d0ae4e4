tracing: Clear all trace buffers when unloaded module event was used

Currently we do not know what buffer a module event was enabled in.
On unload, it is safest to clear all buffer instances, not just the
top level buffer.

Todo: Clear only the buffer that the event was used in. The
infrastructure is there to do this, but it makes the code a bit
more complex. Lets get the current code vetted before we add that.
