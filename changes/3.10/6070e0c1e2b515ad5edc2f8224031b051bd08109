ceph: don't early drop Fw cap

ceph_aio_write() has an optimization that marks CEPH_CAP_FILE_WR
cap dirty before data is copied to page cache and inode size is
updated. The optimization avoids slow cap revocation caused by
balance_dirty_pages(), but introduces inode size update race. If
ceph_check_caps() flushes the dirty cap before the inode size is
updated, MDS can miss the new inode size. So just remove the
optimization.
