clk: Add axi-clkgen driver

This driver adds support for the AXI clkgen pcore to the common clock framework.
The AXI clkgen pcore is a AXI front-end to the MMCM_ADV frequency synthesizer
commonly found in Xilinx FPGAs.

The AXI clkgen pcore is used in Analog Devices' reference designs targeting
Xilinx FPGAs.
