cgroup: fix broken file xattrs

We should store file xattrs in struct cfent instead of struct cftype,
because cftype is a type while cfent is object instance of cftype.

For example each cgroup has a tasks file, and each tasks file is
associated with a uniq cfent, but all those files share the same
struct cftype.

Alexey Kodanev reported a crash, which can be reproduced:

  # mount -t cgroup -o xattr /sys/fs/cgroup
  # mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test
  # setfattr -n trusted.value -v test_value /sys/fs/cgroup/tasks
  # rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test
  # umount /sys/fs/cgroup
  oops!

In this case, simple_xattrs_free() will free the same struct simple_xattrs
twice.

tj: Dropped unused local variable @cft from cgroup_diput().
