libceph: create source file "net/ceph/snapshot.c"

This creates a new source file "net/ceph/snapshot.c" to contain
utility routines related to ceph snapshot contexts.  The main
motivation was to define ceph_create_snap_context() as a common way
to create these structures, but I've moved the definitions of
ceph_get_snap_context() and ceph_put_snap_context() there too.
(The benefit of inlining those is very small, and I'd rather
keep this collection of functions together.)
