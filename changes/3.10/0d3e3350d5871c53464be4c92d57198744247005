mmc: core: fix performance regression initializing MMC host controllers

Commit fa5501890d8974301042e0202d342a6cbe8609f4 introduced a performance
regression by adding mmc_power_up() to mmc_start_host().  mmc_power_up()
is not necessary to host controller initialization, it is part of card
initialization and is performed anyway asynchronously.

This patch allows a driver to leave the power up in asynchronous code
(as it was before).

On my current target platform this reduces driver initialization from:

[    1.313220] initcall sdhci_acpi_driver_init+0x0/0x12 returned 0 after 102008 usecs

to this:

[    1.217209] initcall sdhci_acpi_driver_init+0x0/0x12 returned 0 after 8331 usecs
