[CIFS] cifs: Rename cERROR and cFYI to cifs_dbg

It's not obvious from reading the macro names that these macros
are for debugging.  Convert the names to a single more typical
kernel style cifs_dbg macro.

	cERROR(1, ...)   -> cifs_dbg(VFS, ...)
	cFYI(1, ...)     -> cifs_dbg(FYI, ...)
	cFYI(DBG2, ...)  -> cifs_dbg(NOISY, ...)

Move the terminating format newline from the macro to the call site.

Add CONFIG_CIFS_DEBUG function cifs_vfs_err to emit the
"CIFS VFS: " prefix for VFS messages.

Size is reduced ~ 1% when CONFIG_CIFS_DEBUG is set (default y)

$ size fs/cifs/cifs.ko*
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 265245	   2525	    132	 267902	  4167e	fs/cifs/cifs.ko.new
 268359    2525     132  271016   422a8 fs/cifs/cifs.ko.old

Other miscellaneous changes around these conversions:

o Miscellaneous typo fixes
o Add terminating \n's to almost all formats and remove them
  from the macros to be more kernel style like.  A few formats
  previously had defective \n's
o Remove unnecessary OOM messages as kmalloc() calls dump_stack
o Coalesce formats to make grep easier,
  added missing spaces when coalescing formats
o Use %s, __func__ instead of embedded function name
o Removed unnecessary "cifs: " prefixes
o Convert kzalloc with multiply to kcalloc
o Remove unused cifswarn macro
