[media] tw2804: Revert ADC Control commit 523a4f7fbcf856fb1c2a4850f44edea6738ee37b

Case: In AdLink MPG24 there is bt878 exists (it captures one frame of all video
inputs), Video Signal for it one transmits through tw2804 chip, so we can't
control ADC (shut on/off) on tw2804, as some another can use bttv capture way.
