usb: Make USB persist default configurable

Commit 9214d1d8 set the USB persist flag as a default for all devices.
This might be desirable for some distributions, but it certainly has its
trade-offs... most importantly, it can significantly increase system
resume time, because the kernel blocks on resuming (and sometimes
resetting) USB devices before it unfreezes userspace.

This patch introduces a new config option CONFIG_USB_DEFAULT_PERSIST,
which allows distributions to make this decision on their own without
the need to carry a custom patch or revert the kernel's setting in
userspace.
