ALSA: usb-audio: work around Android accessory firmware bug

When the Android firmware enables the audio interfaces in accessory
mode, it always declares in the control interface's baInterfaceNr array
that interfaces 0 and 1 belong to the audio function.  However, the
accessory interface itself, if also enabled, already is at index 0 and
shifts the actual audio interface numbers to 1 and 2, which prevents the
PCM streaming interface from being seen by the host driver.

To get the PCM interface interface to work, detect when the descriptors
point to the (for this driver useless) accessory interface, and redirect
to the correct one.
