SUNRPC: allow disabling idle timeout

In the gss-proxy case we don't want to have to reconnect at random--we
want to connect only on gss-proxy startup when we can steal gss-proxy's
context to do the connect in the right namespace.

So, provide a flag that allows the rpc_create caller to turn off the
idle timeout.
