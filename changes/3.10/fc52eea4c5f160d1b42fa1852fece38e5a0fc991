6lowpan: handle dev_queue_xmit() error code properly

dev_queue_xmit() will return a positive value if the packet could not be
queued, often because the real network device (in our case the mac802154
wpan device) has its queue stopped.  lowpan_xmit() should handle the
positive return code (for the debug statement) and return that value to
the higher layer so the higher layer will retry sending the packet.
