rbd: rename rbd_dev_probe()

Rename rbd_dev_probe() to be rbd_dev_image_probe().  Its purpose
will eventually be to probe for the existence of a valid rbd image
for the rbd device--focusing only on the ceph side and not the Linux
device side of initialization.

For now the two "sides" are not fully separated, and this function
is still the entry point for initializing the full rbd device.
