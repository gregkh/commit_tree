staging: sync: Update new fence status with sync_fence_signal_pt

If a fence's pt is signaled before sync_fence_create is called, the fence
will never transition into the signaled state.  This also address a tiny
race if a merged fence's pt after sync_fence_get_status checks it's status
and before fence->status is updated.
