staging: comedi: add comedi_release_hardware_device()

Add `comedi_release_hardware_device()` as a replacement for the call
sequence `comedi_find_board_minor()`, `comedi_free_board_minor()`.  This
is slightly safer as we can make sure nothing funny happens to the found
`comedi_file_info_table[]` entry in the middle of the sequence.  Change
`comedi_auto_unconfig()` to call the new function instead of the old
sequence.  Remove `comedi_find_board_minor()` as it has no other
callers.
