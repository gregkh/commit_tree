    drm/i915: Add "Automatic" mode for the "Broadcast RGB" property

but that removed the check to avoid a full modeset if the value is
unchanged. Unfortunately X sets all properties with their current
value at start-up, resulting in some ugly flickering which shouldn't
be there.

v2: Change old_range from bool to uint32_t, spotted by Ville.

v3: Actually git add everything ;-)
