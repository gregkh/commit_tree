tracing: Only clear trace buffer on module unload if event was traced

Currently, when a module with events is unloaded, the trace buffer is
cleared. This is just a safety net in case the module might have some
strange callback when its event is outputted. But there's no reason
to reset the buffer if the module didn't have any of its events traced.

Add a flag to the event "call" structure called WAS_ENABLED and gets set
when the event is ever enabled, and this flag never gets cleared. When a
module gets unloaded, if any of its events have this flag set, then the
trace buffer will get cleared.
