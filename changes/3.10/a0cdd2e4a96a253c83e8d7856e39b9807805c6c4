wlan-ng: clean up prism2sta_inf_chinforesults()

This function is ugly because it hits against the 80 character
limit.  This patch does several things to clean it up.

1) Introduces "result" instead of inf->info.chinforesult.result[n].
2) Reverses the ".scanchannels & (1 << i)" so everthing can be
   pulled in one indent level.
3) Use "chan" instead of "channel".
4) Tweaks the line breaks to the call to pr_debug().
