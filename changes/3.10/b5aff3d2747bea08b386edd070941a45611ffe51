tcm_qla2xxx: Fix residual for underrun commands that fail

Suppose an initiator sends a DATA IN command with an allocation length
shorter than the FC transfer length -- we get a target message like

    TARGET_CORE[qla2xxx]: Expected Transfer Length: 256 does not match SCSI CDB Length: 0 for SAM Opcode: 0x12

In that case, the target core adjusts the data_length and sets
se_cmd->residual_count for the underrun.  But now suppose that command
fails and we end up in tcm_qla2xxx_queue_status() -- that function
unconditionally overwrites residual_count with the already adjusted
data_length, and the initiator will burp with a message like

    qla2xxx [0000:00:06.0]-301d:0: Dropped frame(s) detected (0x100 of 0x100 bytes).

Fix this by adding on to the existing underflow residual count instead.
