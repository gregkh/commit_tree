clk: Fixup locking issues for clk_set_parent

Updating the clock tree topology must be protected with the spinlock
when doing clk_set_parent, otherwise we can not handle the migration
of the enable_count in a safe manner.

While issuing the .set_parent callback to make the clk-hw perform the
switch to the new parent, we can not hold the spinlock since it is must
be allowed to be slow path. This complicates error handling, but is still
possible to achieve.
