ext4: fix type-widening bug in inode table readahead code

Due to a missing cast, the high 32-bits of a 64-bit block number used
when calculating the readahead block for inode tables can get lost.
This means we can end up fetching the wrong blocks for readahead for
file systems > 16TB.

Linus found this when experimenting with an enhacement to the sparse
static code checker which checks for missing widening casts before
binary "not" operators.
