stmmac: support extend descriptors

This patch is to support the extend descriptors available
in the chips newer than the 3.50.

In case of the extend descriptors cannot be supported,
at runtime, the driver will continue to work using the old style.

In detail, this support extends the main descriptor structure
adding new descriptors: 4, 5, 6, 7. The desc4 gives us extra
information about the received ethernet payload when it is
carrying PTP packets or TCP/UDP/ICMP over IP packets.
The descriptors 6 and 7 are used for saving HW L/H timestamps (PTP).

V2: this new version removes the Koption added in the first implementation
because all the checks now to verify if the extended descriptors are
actually supported happen at probe time.
