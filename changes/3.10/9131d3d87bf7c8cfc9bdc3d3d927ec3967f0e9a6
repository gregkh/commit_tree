drm: cleanup: use drm_framebuffer_reference instead of a kref_get

drm_framebuffer_lookup() does a kref_get() for the framebuffer if it finds one
corresponding to the fb id passed to it. Use drm_framebuffer_reference() instead
for clarity since it's the function used in other places to take a reference.
