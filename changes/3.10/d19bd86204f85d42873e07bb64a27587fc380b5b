KVM: PPC: Book3S: Add support for ibm,int-on/off RTAS calls

This adds support for the ibm,int-on and ibm,int-off RTAS calls to the
in-kernel XICS emulation and corrects the handling of the saved
priority by the ibm,set-xive RTAS call.  With this, ibm,int-off sets
the specified interrupt's priority in its saved_priority field and
sets the priority to 0xff (the least favoured value).  ibm,int-on
restores the saved_priority to the priority field, and ibm,set-xive
sets both the priority and the saved_priority to the specified
priority value.
