[media] s5p-fimc: Add device tree support for FIMC device driver

This patch adds device tree support for FIMC driver on S5PV210
and Exynos4 SoCs.
The FIMC IP block's features and quirks encoded statically in
the driver are now parsed from the device tree. Once all relevant
platforms are converted to device tree based booting the FIMC
variant data structures will all be removed from the driver.
