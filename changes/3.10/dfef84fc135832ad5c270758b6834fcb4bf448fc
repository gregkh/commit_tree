[media] siano: get rid of CammelCase from smscoreapi.h

It is almost impossible to see a compliant with checkpatch.pl
on those Siano drivers, as there are simply too much violations
on it. So, now that a big change was done, the better is to
cleanup the checkpatch compliants.

Let's first replace all CammelCase symbols found at smscoreapi.h
using camel_case namespace. That removed 144 checkpatch.pl
compliants on this file. Of course, the other files need to be
fixed accordingly.
