perf stat: Add per-core aggregation

This patch adds the --per-core option to perf stat.

This option is used to aggregate system-wide counts
on a per physical core basis. On processors with
hyperthreading, this means counts of all HT threads
running on a physical core are aggregated.

This mode is useful to find imblance between physical
cores running an uniform workload. Cores are identified
by socket: S0-C1, means physical core 1 on socket 0. Note
that cores are identified using their physical core id,
thus their numbering may not be continuous.

Per core aggregation can be combined with interval printing:

 # perf stat -a --per-core -I 1000 -e cycles sleep 1000
 #           time core         cpus             counts events
      1.000090030 S0-C0           1          4,765,747 cycles
      1.000090030 S0-C1           1          5,580,647 cycles
      1.000090030 S0-C2           1            221,181 cycles
      1.000090030 S0-C3           1            266,092 cycles
