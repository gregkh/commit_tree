rbd: define zero_pages()

Define a new function zero_pages() that zeroes a range of memory
defined by a page array, along the lines of zero_bio_chain().  It
saves and the irq flags like bvec_kmap_irq() does, though I'm not
sure at this point that it's necessary.

Update rbd_img_obj_request_read_callback() to use the new function
if the object request contains page rather than bio data.

For the moment, only bio data is used for osd READ ops.
