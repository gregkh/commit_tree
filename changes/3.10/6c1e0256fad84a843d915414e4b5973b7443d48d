context_tracking: Restore correct previous context state on exception exit

On exception exit, we restore the previous context tracking state based on
the regs of the interrupted frame. Iff that frame is in user mode as
stated by user_mode() helper, we restore the context tracking user mode.

However there is a tiny chunck of low level arch code after we pass through
user_enter() and until the CPU eventually resumes userspace.
If an exception happens in this tiny area, exception_enter() correctly
exits the context tracking user mode but exception_exit() won't restore
it because of the value returned by user_mode(regs).

As a result we may return to userspace with the wrong context tracking
state.

To fix this, change exception_enter() to return the context tracking state
prior to its call and pass this saved state to exception_exit(). This restores
the real context tracking state of the interrupted frame.

(May be this patch was suggested to me, I don't recall exactly. If so,
sorry for the missing credit).
