staging: comedi: mite: use pci_ioremap_bar()

Use pci_ioremap_bar() to ioremap the PCI resources. That function
just takes the pci device and a bar number. It also has some
additional sanity checks to make sure the bar is actually a
memory resource.

This also makes sure that the entire PCI bar is ioremap'ed instead
of assuming the size of a bar.

For aesthetic reasons, don't set the private data phys_addr vars
until after the ioremap is successful.
