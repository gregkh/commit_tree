pinctrl/pinconfig: add debug interface

This update adds a debugfs interface to modify a pin configuration
for a given state in the pinctrl map. This allows to modify the
configuration for a non-active state, typically sleep state.
This configuration is not applied right away, but only when the state
will be entered.

This solution is mandated for us by HW validation: in order
to test and verify several pin configurations during sleep without
recompiling the software.

Change log in this patch set;
Take into account latest feedback from Stephen Warren:
- stale comments update
- improved code efficiency and readibility
- limit size of global variable pinconf_dbg_conf
- remove req_type as it can easily be added later when
add/delete requests support is implemented
