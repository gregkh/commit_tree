init: Do not warn on non-zero initcall return

Commit f91eb62f71b3 ("init: scream bloody murder if interrupts are
enabled too early") added three new warnings.  The first two seemed
reasonable, but the third included a warning when an initcall returned
non-zero.  Although, the third WARN() does include an imbalanced preempt
disabled, or irqs disable, it shouldn't warn if it only had an initcall
that just returns non-zero.

In fact, according to Linus, it shouldn't print at all.  As it only
prints with initcall_debug set, and that already shows enough
information to fix things.
