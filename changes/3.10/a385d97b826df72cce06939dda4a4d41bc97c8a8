ALSA: hda - Introduce "Headset Mic" name

Headset mic jacks, i e TRRS style jacks with Headphone Left,
Headphone Right, Mic and GND signals, are becoming increasingly
common and are now being shipped by several manufacturers.

Unfortunately, the HDA specification does not give us any hint
of whether a Mic pin belongs to such a jack or not, but it would
still be helpful for the user to know (especially if there is one
TRS Mic jack and one TRRS headset jack).

This new fixup causes the first (non-dock, non-internal) mic to
be a headset mic jack. The algorithm can be later refined if needed.
