ACPI: Remove acpi_device dependency in acpi_device_set_id()

This patch updates the internal operations of acpi_device_set_id()
to setup acpi_device_pnp without using acpi_device.  There is no
functional change to acpi_device_set_id() in this patch.

acpi_pnp_type is added to acpi_device_pnp, so that PNPID type is
self-contained within acpi_device_pnp.  acpi_add_id(), acpi_bay_match(),
acpi_dock_match(), acpi_ibm_smbus_match() and acpi_is_video_device()
are changed to take acpi_handle as an argument, instead of acpi_device.
