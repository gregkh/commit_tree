nfsd4: handle seqid-mutating open errors from xdr decoding

If a client sets an owner (or group_owner or acl) attribute on open for
create, and the mapping of that owner to an id fails, then we return
BAD_OWNER.  But BAD_OWNER is a seqid-mutating error, so we can't
shortcut the open processing that case: we have to at least look up the
owner so we can find the seqid to bump.
