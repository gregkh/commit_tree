net/mlx4: Add structures to keep VF Ethernet ports information

This patch add struct mlx4_vport_state where all the parameters related
to management of VFs port (virtual ports of the NIC eswitch) are kept.

The driver keeps an administrative and operational copy of the settings.
The current administrative copy becomes operational on the event of probing
a VF either on a VM or on the host.
