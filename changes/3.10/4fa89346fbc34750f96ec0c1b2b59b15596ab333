ALSA: ASoC: add codec driver for TI TAS5086

This patch adds a driver for TI's TA5086 6-channel PWM processor.

This chip has a very unusual register layout, specifically because the
registers are of unequal size, and multi-byte registers require bulk
writes to take effect. Regmap does not support these kind of mappings.

Currently, the driver does not touch any of the registers >= 0x20, so
it doesn't matter, because the register map is mapped to an 8-bit array.
In case more features will be added in the future that require access
to higher registers, the entire regmap H/W I/O routines have to be
open-coded.
