ACPI / PM: Fix error code path for power resources initialization

Commit 781d737 (ACPI: Drop power resources driver) introduced a
bug in the power resources initialization error code path causing
a NULL pointer to be referenced in acpi_release_power_resource()
if there's an error triggering a jump to the 'err' label in
acpi_add_power_resource().  This happens because the list_node
field of struct acpi_power_resource has not been initialized yet
at this point and doing a list_del() on it is a bad idea.

To prevent this problem from occuring, initialize the list_node
field of struct acpi_power_resource upfront.
