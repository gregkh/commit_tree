team: move add to port list before port enablement

team_port_enable() adds port to port_hashlist. Reader sees port
in team_get_port_by_index_rcu() and returns it, but
team_get_first_port_txable_rcu() tries to go through port_list, where the
port is not inserted yet -> NULL pointer dereference.
Fix this by reordering port_list and port_hashlist insertion.
Panic is easily triggeable when txing packets and adding/removing port
in a loop.
