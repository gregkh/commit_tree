ARM: dts: mvebu: Fix wrong the address reg value for the L2-cache node

During the conversion to the internal-regs' subnode, the L2-cache node
haven not been converted (due to a wrong choice made by myself during
the resolution of the merge conflict when I rebased the commit). This
leads to wrong address for L2 cache which prevent it to be used on
Armada 370. This commit fix the address reg of the e L2-cache node.
