fs: make binfmt support for #! scripts modular and removable

Add a new configuration option CONFIG_BINFMT_SCRIPT to configure support
for interpreted scripts starting with "#!"; allow compiling out that
support, or building it as a module.  Embedded systems running exclusively
compiled binaries could leave this support out, and systems that don't
need scripts before mounting the root filesystem can build this as a
module.
