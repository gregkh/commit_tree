ARM/dts: OMAP3: fix pinctrl-single configuration

 - Fix 'function-mask' referring to TRM (Omap 36xx) Section 13.4.4:
   "Pad Functional Multiplexing and Configuration".
 - Fix 'omap3_pmx_wkup' referring to TRM Table 13-6:
   "Wkup Control Module Pad Configuration Register Fields".

Note that these fixes are not critical currently as we
are not yet using the missing range of pinmux registers
at this point.
