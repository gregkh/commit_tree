drbd: Fix disconnect to keep the peer disk state if connection breaks during operation

The issue was that if the connection broke while we did the
gracefull state change to C_DISCONNECTING (C_TEARDOWN), then
we returned a success code from the state engine. (SS_CW_NO_NEED)

The result of that is that we missed to call the fence-peer
script in such a case.

Fixed that by introducing a new error code (SS_OUTDATE_WO_CONN).
This one should never reach back into user space.
