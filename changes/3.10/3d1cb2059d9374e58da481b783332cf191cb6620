workqueue: include workqueue info when printing debug dump of a worker task

One of the problems that arise when converting dedicated custom
threadpool to workqueue is that the shared worker pool used by workqueue
anonimizes each worker making it more difficult to identify what the
worker was doing on which target from the output of sysrq-t or debug
dump from oops, BUG() and friends.

This patch implements set_worker_desc() which can be called from any
workqueue work function to set its description.  When the worker task is
dumped for whatever reason - sysrq-t, WARN, BUG, oops, lockdep assertion
and so on - the description will be printed out together with the
workqueue name and the worker function pointer.

The printing side is implemented by print_worker_info() which is called
from functions in task dump paths - sched_show_task() and
dump_stack_print_info().  print_worker_info() can be safely called on
any task in any state as long as the task struct itself is accessible.
It uses probe_*() functions to access worker fields.  It may print
garbage if something went very wrong, but it wouldn't cause (another)
oops.

The description is currently limited to 24bytes including the
terminating \0.  worker->desc_valid and workder->desc[] are added and
the 64 bytes marker which was already incorrect before adding the new
fields is moved to the correct position.

Here's an example dump with writeback updated to set the bdi name as
worker desc.
