usb: gadget: s3c-hsudc: delete outdated comment

since commit d93e260 (usb: gadget: s3c-hsudc: use udc_start and udc_stop
functions) the 'driver' parameter has been deleted from
s3c_hsudc_stop_activity() but its documentation was left outdated. This
patch deletes the comment since it makes no sense anymore.
