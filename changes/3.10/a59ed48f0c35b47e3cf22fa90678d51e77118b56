[media] exynos4-is: Set fimc-lite subdev owner module

The FIMC-LITE.n subdevs have currently sd->owner field not set,
the exynos-fimc-lite module can be removed at any time, regardless
it is in use by other modules. When this module is unloaded the
kernel can crash easily by accessing video or media device nodes.
