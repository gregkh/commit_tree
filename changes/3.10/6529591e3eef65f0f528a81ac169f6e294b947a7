USB: Serial: cypress_M8: Enable FRWD Dongle hidcom device

The patch adds a new HIDCOM device and does not affect other devices
driven by the cypress_M8 module. Changes are:
- add VendorID ProductID to device tables
- skip unstable speed check because FRWD uses 115200bps
- skip reset at probe which is an issue workaround for this
particular device.
