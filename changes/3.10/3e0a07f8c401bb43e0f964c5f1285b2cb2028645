ARM: 7773/1: PJ4B: Add support for errata 4742

This commit fixes the regression on Armada 370 (the kernal hang during
boot) introduced by the commit: "ARM: 7691/1: mm: kill unused
TLB_CAN_READ_FROM_L1_CACHE and use ALT_SMP instead".

When coming out of either a Wait for Interrupt (WFI) or a Wait for
Event (WFE) IDLE states, a specific timing sensitivity exists between
the retiring WFI/WFE instructions and the newly issued subsequent
instructions. This sensitivity can result in a CPU hang scenario.  The
workaround is to insert either a Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB) or
Data Memory Barrier (DMB) command immediately after the WFI/WFE
instruction.

This commit was based on the work of Lior Amsalem, but heavily
modified to apply the errata fix dynamically according to the
processor type thanks to the suggestions of Russell King and Nicolas
Pitre.
