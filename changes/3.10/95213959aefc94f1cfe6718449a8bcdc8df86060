powerpc/perf: Add new BHRB related instructions for POWER8

This patch adds new POWER8 instruction encoding for reading
and clearing Branch History Rolling Buffer entries. The new
instruction 'mfbhrbe' (move from branch history rolling buffer
entry) is used to read BHRB buffer entries and instruction
'clrbhrb' (clear branch history rolling buffer) is used to
clear the entire buffer. The instruction 'clrbhrb' has straight
forward encoding. But the instruction encoding format for
reading the BHRB entries is like 'mfbhrbe RT, BHRBE' where it
takes two arguments, i.e the index for the BHRB buffer entry to
read and a general purpose register to put the value which was
read from the buffer entry.
