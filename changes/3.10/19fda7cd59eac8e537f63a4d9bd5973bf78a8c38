usb: dwc3: add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions

Add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions to fix the following
build warning when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not selected. This is because
sleep PM callbacks defined by SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS are only used
when the CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled. Unnecessary CONFIG_PM ifdefs
are removed.
