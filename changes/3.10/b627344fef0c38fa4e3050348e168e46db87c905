tracing: Fix read blocking on trace_pipe_raw

If the ring buffer is empty, a read to trace_pipe_raw wont block.
The tracing code has the infrastructure to wake up waiting readers,
but the trace_pipe_raw doesn't take advantage of that.

When a read is done to trace_pipe_raw without the O_NONBLOCK flag
set, have the read block until there's data in the requested buffer.
