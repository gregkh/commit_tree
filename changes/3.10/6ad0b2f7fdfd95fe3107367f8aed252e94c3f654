VSOCK: Fix misc device registration

When we call vsock_core_init to init VSOCK the second time,
vsock_device.minor still points to the old dynamically allocated minor
number. misc_register will allocate it for us successfully as if we were
asking for a static one. However, when other user call misc_register to
allocate a dynamic minor number, it will give the one used by
vsock_core_init(), causing this:

  [  405.470687] WARNING: at fs/sysfs/dir.c:536 sysfs_add_one+0xcc/0xf0()
  [  405.470689] Hardware name: OptiPlex 790
  [  405.470690] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/dev/char/10:54'

Always set vsock_device.minor to MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR before we
register.
