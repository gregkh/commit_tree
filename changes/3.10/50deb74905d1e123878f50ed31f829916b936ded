[media] go7007: tuner/std related fixes

- The Adlink is initially detected as a sensor board, so the driver config
  is set up as if it was a sensor. Later the driver discovers that it really
  is a video capture card and that means that the driver configuration has
  to be updated for a PAL/NTSC capture card.
- Setup the correct initial std based on the TV tuner type.
- Remember the exact std the user selected, don't map it to STD_PAL or NTSC.
- Use v4l2_disable_ioctl to disable ioctls based on the board config and
  drop a lot of checking code in each of those ioctls since that is no longer
  needed.
- enum_input should use tvnorms to fill its std field.
- configure the input, std and initial tuner frequency at driver initialization.
- fix std handling in the s2250 driver.
- the code handling scaling for devices without a scaler was broken. This is
  now fixed.
- correctly set readbuffers and capability in g/s_parm.
- remove the bogus test for capturemode in s_parm.
- correctly implement enum_framesizes/intervals.
