ALSA: snd-usb: add support for DSD DOP stream transport

In order to provide a compatibility way for pushing DSD
samples through ordinary PCM channels, the "DoP open Standard" was
invented. See http://www.dsd-guide.com for the official document.

The host is required to stuff DSD marker bytes (0x05, 0xfa,
alternating) in the MSB of 24 bit wide samples on the bus, in addition
to the 16 bits of actual DSD sample payload.

To support this, the hardware and software stride logic in the driver
has to be tweaked a bit, as we make the userspace believe we're
operating on 16 bit samples, while we in fact push one more byte per
channel down to the hardware.

The DOP runtime information is stored in struct snd_usb_substream, so
we can keep track of our state across multiple calls to
prepare_playback_urb_dsd_dop().
