ASoC: davinci-mcasp: don't overwrite DIT settings

Channel size settings will be made at the end of
davinci_mcasp_hw_params() routine and thus overwrite frame
format settings made for DIT mode. This patch fixes this issue
by taking op_mode into account. Tested with official PSP 3.2
kernel and sii9022a HDMI transmitter.
