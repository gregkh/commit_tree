USB: serial: clean up generic-operation handling

Most USB serial drivers are, and should be, using as much of the generic
implementation as possible.

Rename the fixup_generic function to a more descriptive name.
Reword the related debug message in a more neutral tone (and remember to
add the missing newline).
Finally, move the operations initialisation to after the initial sanity
checks.
