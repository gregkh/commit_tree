workqueue: drop WQ_RESCUER and test workqueue->rescuer for NULL instead

WQ_RESCUER is superflous.  WQ_MEM_RECLAIM indicates that the user
wants a rescuer and testing wq->rescuer for NULL can answer whether a
given workqueue has a rescuer or not.  Drop WQ_RESCUER and test
wq->rescuer directly.

This will help simplifying __alloc_workqueue_key() failure path by
allowing it to use destroy_workqueue() on a partially constructed
workqueue, which in turn will help implementing dynamic management of
pool_workqueues.

While at it, clear wq->rescuer after freeing it in
destroy_workqueue().  This is a precaution as scheduled changes will
make destruction more complex.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
