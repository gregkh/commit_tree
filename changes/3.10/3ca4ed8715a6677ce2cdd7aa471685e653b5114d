i2c-designware: enable/disable the controller properly

The correct way to disable or enable the controller is to wait until the
DW_IC_ENABLE_STATUS register bit matches the bit we program into DW_IC_ENABLE
register. This procedure is described in the DesignWare I2C databook.

By doing this we can be sure that the controller is in correct state once
the function returns.
