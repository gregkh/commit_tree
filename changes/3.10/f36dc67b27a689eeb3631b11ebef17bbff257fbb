workqueue: change argument of worker_maybe_bind_and_lock() to @pool

worker_maybe_bind_and_lock() currently takes @worker but only cares
about @worker->pool.  This patch updates worker_maybe_bind_and_lock()
to take @pool instead of @worker.  This will be used to better define
synchronization rules regarding rescuer->pool updates.

This doesn't introduce any functional change.
