powerpc/power8: Fix secondary CPUs hanging on boot for HV=0

In __restore_cpu_power8 we determine if we are HV and if not, we return
before setting HV only resources.

Unfortunately we forgot to restore the link register from r11 before
returning.

This will happen on boot and with secondary CPUs not coming online.

This adds the missing link register restore.
