arm: plat-orion: only build addr-map.c when needed

-flagmail-match: MVEBU

For now, addr-map.c is needed by all 5 Marvell EBU
sub-architectures. However, we are going to introduce the orion-mbus
driver, which will replace the address decoding code from
addr-map.c. In order to ease the migration process, we will do that
one sub-architecture at a time, which will require us to remove the
compilation of addr-map.c one sub-architecture at a time.

Therefore, we split the unconditional obj-y inclusion of addr-map.c
into 5 conditionals obj-$(CONFIG_...) lines, one per sub-architecture.
