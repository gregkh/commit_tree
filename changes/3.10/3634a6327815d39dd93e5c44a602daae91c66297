fuse: truncate pagecache range on hole punch

fuse supports hole punch via the fallocate() FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
interface. When a hole punch is passed through, the page cache
is not cleared and thus allows reading stale data from the cache.

This is easily demonstrable (using FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE) by reading a
smallish random data file into cache, punching a hole and creating
a copy of the file. Drop caches or remount and observe that the
original file no longer matches the file copied after the hole
punch. The original file contains a zeroed range and the latter
file contains stale data.

Protect against writepage requests in progress and punch out the
associated page cache range after a successful client fs hole
punch.
