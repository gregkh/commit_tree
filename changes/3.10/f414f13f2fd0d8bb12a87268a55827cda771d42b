ARM: make machine_desc->init_time default to clocksource_of_init

Originally from a default machine descriptor patch from Arnd, pull out
just the default call to clocksource_of_init part. This is needed so that
platforms can simply remove .init_time calls as they are converted to use
clocksource_of_init.
