cfg80211: introduce critical protocol indication from user-space

Some protocols need a more reliable connection to complete
successful in reasonable time. This patch adds a user-space
API to indicate the wireless driver that a critical protocol
is about to commence and when it is done, using nl80211 primitives
NL80211_CMD_CRIT_PROTOCOL_START and NL80211_CRIT_PROTOCOL_STOP.

There can be only on critical protocol session started per
registered cfg80211 device.

The driver can support this by implementing the cfg80211 callbacks
.crit_proto_start() and .crit_proto_stop(). Examples of protocols
that can benefit from this are DHCP, EAPOL, APIPA. Exactly how the
link can/should be made more reliable is up to the driver. Things
to consider are avoid scanning, no multi-channel operations, and
alter coexistence schemes.
