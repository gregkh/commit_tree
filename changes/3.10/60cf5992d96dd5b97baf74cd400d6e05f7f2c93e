libceph: don't pass request to calc_layout()

The only remaining reason to pass the osd request to calc_layout()
is to fill in its r_num_pages and r_page_alignment fields.  Once it
fills those in, it doesn't do anything more with them.

We can therefore move those assignments into the caller, and get rid
of the "req" parameter entirely.

Note, however, that the only caller is ceph_osdc_new_request(),
and that immediately overwrites those fields with values based on
its passed-in page offset.  So the assignment inside calc_layout()
was redundant anyway.

This resolves:
