ALSA: Make snd_BUG_ON() always evaluate and return the conditional expression

Having snd_BUG_ON() only evaluate its conditional when CONFIG_SND_DEBUG
is set leads to frequent bugs, since other similar macros in the kernel
have different behavior. Let's make snd_BUG_ON() act like those macros
so it will stop being accidentally misused.
