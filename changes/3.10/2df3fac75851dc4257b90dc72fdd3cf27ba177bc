rbd: define rbd_dev_v2_header_info()

This rearranges rbd_dev_v2_refresh() so it works more like
rbd_dev_v1_header_info().  While format 1 images need to read the
whole header object to get any information, format 2 can collect
almost all information selectively.  So the one-time initialization
will remain in a separate function--based on rbd_dev_v2_probe().

Rename rbd_dev_v2_refresh() to be rbd_dev_v2_header_info(), and have
it call rbd_dev_v2_header_onetime() if it's being called for the
first time for the given rbd device.

Rename rbd_dev_v2_probe() to be rbd_dev_v2_header_onetime() and
remove the image size and snapshot context calls it held in
common with the refresh function.
