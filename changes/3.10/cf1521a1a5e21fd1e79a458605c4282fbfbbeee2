crypto: twofish - add AVX2/x86_64 assembler implementation of twofish cipher

Patch adds AVX2/x86-64 implementation of Twofish cipher, requiring 16 parallel
blocks for input (256 bytes). Table look-ups are performed using vpgatherdd
instruction directly from vector registers and thus should be faster than
earlier implementations. Implementation also uses 256-bit wide YMM registers,
which should give additional speed up compared to the AVX implementation.
