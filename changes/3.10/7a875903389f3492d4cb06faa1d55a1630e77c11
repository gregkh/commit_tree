caif: remove caif_shm

caif_shm is an old implementation
caif_shm will be replaced by caif_virtio

[ As explained by Linus Walleij: "U5500 used this, but was cancelled
  and the silicon did not reach anyone outside ST-Ericsson.  Then for
  the next platforms, we have gone for the leaner & cleaner approach
  of using virtio, rpmesg and rproc." ]
