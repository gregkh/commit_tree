perf/x86: Add support for PEBS Precise Store

This patch adds support for PEBS Precise Store
which is available on Intel Sandy Bridge and
Ivy Bridge processors.

To use Precise store, the proper PEBS event
must be used: mem_trans_retired:precise_stores.
For the perf tool, the generic mem-stores event
exported via sysfs can be used directly.
