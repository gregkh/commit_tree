ARM: mvebu: Add support for NOR flash device on Openblocks AX3 board

The Plat'home Openblocks AX3 has a 128 MiB NOR flash device connected
to the Device Bus. This commit adds the device tree node to support this device.

The SoC supports a flexible and dynamic decoding window allocation scheme;
but since this feature is still not implemented we need to specify the window
base address in the device tree node itself.
This base address has been selected in a completely arbitrary fashion.
