HID: i2c-hid: fix length for set/get report in i2c hid

With the current i2c hid driver set/get report does not work
as expected, for e.g sensor hub properties like power state,
frequency etc is not set properly on the device as a result
we do not get events.
The problem is that i2c hid driver in function i2c_hid_request
sets length equal to default buffer size for which the sensor
hub does not respond on get/set commands. Use report length
and calculate it based on report size and id.
