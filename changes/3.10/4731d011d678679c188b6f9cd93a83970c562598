net: tcp_memcontrol: minor: remove unused variable

Commit 10b96f7306e5 (``tcp_memcontrol: remove a redundant statement
in tcp_destroy_cgroup()'') says ``We read the value but make no use
of it.'', but forgot to remove the variable declaration as well. This
was a follow-up commit of 3f1346193 (``memcg: decrement static keys
at real destroy time'') that removed the read of variable 'val'.

This fixes therefore:

  CC      net/ipv4/tcp_memcontrol.o
net/ipv4/tcp_memcontrol.c: In function ‘tcp_destroy_cgroup’:
net/ipv4/tcp_memcontrol.c:67:6: warning: unused variable ‘val’ [-Wunused-variable]
