Bluetooth: Fix local name setting for LE-only controllers

This patch fixes the mgmt_set_local_name command to send the appropriate
HCI commands based on BR/EDR support and LE support. Local name and EIR
data should only be sent for BR/EDR capable controllers whereas an
update to the AD should only happen for LE capable controllers.
