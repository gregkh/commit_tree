HWPOISON: check dirty flag to match against clean page

Currently page_action() does not check dirty flag to determine whether
the error page is "clean mlocked/unevictable LRU" page.  This doesn't
cause any misjudgement because we do matching against "dirty
mlocked/unevictable LRU" just before the check.  But in order to make
code consistent and/or to avoid potential regression, we had better
check dirty flag explicitly.
