netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: zero copy support

nfqnl_build_packet_message() actually copy the packet
inside the netlink message, while it can instead use
zero copy.

Make sure the skb 'copy' is the last component of the
cooked netlink message, as we cant add anything after it.

Patch cooked in Copenhagen at Netfilter Workshop ;)

Still to be addressed in separate patches :

-GRO/GSO packets are segmented in nf_queue()
and checksummed in nfqnl_build_packet_message().

Proper support for GSO/GRO packets (no segmentation,
and no checksumming) needs application cooperation, if we
want no regressions.
