NFSv4: Handle timeouts correctly when probing for lease validity

When we send a RENEW or SEQUENCE operation in order to probe if the
lease is still valid, we want it to be able to time out since the
lease we are probing is likely to time out too. Currently, because
we use soft mount semantics for these RPC calls, the return value
is EIO, which causes the state manager to exit with an "unhandled
error" message.
This patch changes the call semantics, so that the RPC layer returns
ETIMEDOUT instead of EIO. We then have the state manager default to
a simple retry instead of exiting.
