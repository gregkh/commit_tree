cpufreq: governors: Calculate iowait time only when necessary

Currently we always calculate the CPU iowait time and add it to idle time.
If we are in ondemand and we use io_is_busy, we re-calculate iowait time
and we subtract it from idle time.

With this patch iowait time is calculated only when necessary avoiding
the double call to get_cpu_iowait_time_us. We use a parameter in
function get_cpu_idle_time to distinguish when the iowait time will be
added to idle time or not, without the need of keeping the prev_io_wait.
