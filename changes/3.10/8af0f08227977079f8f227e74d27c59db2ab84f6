ext4: fix readdir error in the case of inline_data+dir_index

Zach reported a problem that if inline data is enabled, we don't
tell the difference between the offset of '.' and '..'. And a
getdents will fail if the user only want to get '.' and what's worse,
if there is a conversion happens when the user calls getdents
many times, he/she may get the same entry twice.

In theory, a dir block would also fail if it is converted to a
hashed-index based dir since f_pos will become a hash value, not the
real one, but it doesn't happen.  And a deep investigation shows that
we uses a hash based solution even for a normal dir if the dir_index
feature is enabled.

So this patch just adds a new htree_inlinedir_to_tree for inline dir,
and if we find that the hash index is supported, we will do like what
we do for a dir block.
