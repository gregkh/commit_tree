staging: comedi: adjust module count on device cleanup

`comedi_device_cleanup()` is called just before freeing a comedi device.
It is possible for the device to still be open in which case the module
reference counts for the core comedi module and possibly the low-level
driver module will remain out of whack because `comedi_close()` will not
find the comedi device and so will not decrement the module counts.

This really needs to be handled better, but for now decrement the module
counts in `comedi_device_cleanup()` according to the number of
outstanding opens.
