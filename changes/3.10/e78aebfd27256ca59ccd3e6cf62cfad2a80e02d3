uretprobes: Reserve the first slot in xol_vma for trampoline

Allocate trampoline page, as the very first one in uprobed
task xol area, and fill it with breakpoint opcode.

Also introduce get_trampoline_vaddr() helper, to wrap the
trampoline address extraction from area->vaddr. That removes
confusion and eases the debug experience in case ->vaddr
notion will be changed.
