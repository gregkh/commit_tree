netfilter: ipt_ULOG: fix non-null terminated string in the nf_log path

If nf_log uses ipt_ULOG as logging output, we can deliver non-null
terminated strings to user-space since the maximum length of the
prefix that is passed by nf_log is NF_LOG_PREFIXLEN but pm->prefix
is 32 bytes long (ULOG_PREFIX_LEN).

This is actually happening already from nf_conntrack_tcp if ipt_ULOG
is used, since it is passing strings longer than 32 bytes.
