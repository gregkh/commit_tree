NFC: llcp: Service Name Lookup netlink interface

This adds a netlink interface for service name lookup support.
Multiple URIs can be passed nested into the NFC_ATTR_LLC_SDP attribute
using the NFC_CMD_LLC_SDREQ netlink command.
When the SNL reply is received, a NFC_EVENT_LLC_SDRES event is sent to
the user space. URI and SAP tuples are passed back, nested into
NFC_ATTR_LLC_SDP attribute.
