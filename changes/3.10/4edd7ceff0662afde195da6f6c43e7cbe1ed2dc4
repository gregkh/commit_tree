mm, hotplug: avoid compiling memory hotremove functions when disabled

__remove_pages() is only necessary for CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE.  PowerPC
pseries will return -EOPNOTSUPP if unsupported.

Adding an #ifdef causes several other functions it depends on to also
become unnecessary, which saves in .text when disabled (it's disabled in
most defconfigs besides powerpc, including x86).  remove_memory_block()
becomes static since it is not referenced outside of
drivers/base/memory.c.

Build tested on x86 and powerpc with CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE both enabled
and disabled.
