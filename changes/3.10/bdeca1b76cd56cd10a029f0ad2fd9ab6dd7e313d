NFSv4: Don't recheck permissions on open in case of recovery cached open

If we already checked the user access permissions on the original open,
then don't bother checking again on recovery. Doing so can cause a
deadlock with NFSv4.1, since the may_open() operation is not privileged.
Furthermore, we can't report an access permission failure here anyway.
