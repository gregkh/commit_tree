Revert "drm/i915: revert eDP bpp clamping code changes"

This reverts commit 57c219633275c7e7413f8bc7be250dc092887458.

It's an ugly hack for a Haswell SDV platform where the vbt doesn't
seem to fully agree with the panel. Since it seems to cause issues on
real eDP platform let's just kill this hack again.
