s390: system call path micro optimization

Add a pointer to the system call table to the thread_info structure.
The TIF_31BIT bit is set or cleared by SET_PERSONALITY exactly once
for the lifetime of a process. With the pointer to the correct system
call table in thread_info the system call code in entry64.S path can
drop the check for TIF_31BIT which saves a couple of instructions.
