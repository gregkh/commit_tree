USB: EHCI: change return value of qh_completions()

This patch (as1658) cleans up the usage of qh_completions() in
ehci-hcd.  Currently the function's return value indicates whether any
URBs were given back; the idea was that the caller can scan the QH
over again to handle any URBs that were dequeued by a completion
handler.  This is not necessary; when qh_completions() is ready to
give back dequeued URBs, it does its own rescanning.

Therefore the new return value will be a flag indicating whether the
caller needs to unlink the QH.  This is more convenient than forcing
the caller to check qh->needs_rescan, and it makes a lot more sense --
why should "needs_rescan" imply that an unlink is needed?  The callers
are also changed to remove the unneeded rescans.

Lastly, the check for whether qh->qtd_list is non-empty is removed
from the start of qh_completions().  Two of the callers have to make
this test anyway, so the same test can simply be added to the other
two callers.
