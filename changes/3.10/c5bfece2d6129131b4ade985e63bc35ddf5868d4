nohz: Switch from "extended nohz" to "full nohz" based naming

"Extended nohz" was used as a naming base for the full dynticks
API and Kconfig symbols. It reflects the fact the system tries
to stop the tick in more places than just idle.

But that "extended" name is a bit opaque and vague. Rename it to
"full" makes it clearer what the system tries to do under this
config: try to shutdown the tick anytime it can. The various
constraints that prevent that to happen shouldn't be considered
as fundamental properties of this feature but rather technical
issues that may be solved in the future.
