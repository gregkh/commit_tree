clk: divider: Introduce CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO flag

Dividers which have CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED set have a redundant state,
being a divider value of zero. Some hardware implementations allow a
zero divider which simply doesn't alter the frequency. I.e. it acts like
a divide by one or bypassing the divider.
This flag is used to handle such HW in the clk-divider model.
