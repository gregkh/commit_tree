ARM: 7709/1: mcpm: Add explicit AFLAGS to support v6/v7 multiplatform kernels

The full mcpm layer is not likely to be relevant to v6 based
platforms, so a multiplatform kernel won't use that code if booted
on v6 hardware.

This patch modifies the AFLAGS for affected mcpm .S files to
specify armv7-a explicitly for that code.
