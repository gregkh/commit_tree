cifs: only set ops for inodes in I_NEW state

It's generally not safe to reset the inode ops once they've been set. In
the case where the inode was originally thought to be a directory and
then later found to be a DFS referral, this can lead to an oops when we
try to trigger an inode op on it after changing the ops to the blank
referral operations.
