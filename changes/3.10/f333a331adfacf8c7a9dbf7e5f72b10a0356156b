spi/tegra114: add spi driver

Add SPI driver for NVIDIA's Tegra114 SPI controller. This controller
is different than the older SoCs SPI controller in internal design as
well as register interface.

This driver supports the:
- non DMA based transfer for smaller transfer i.e. less than FIFO depth.
- APB DMA based transfer for larger transfer i.e. more than FIFO depth.
- Clock gating through runtime PM callbacks.
- registration through DT only.
