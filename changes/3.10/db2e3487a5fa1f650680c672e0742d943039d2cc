staging: comedi: set hw_dev in comedi_alloc_board_minor()

Call `comedi_set_hw_dev()` to set the `hw_dev` member of `struct
comedi_device` in `comedi_alloc_board_minor()` instead of in
`comedi_auto_config()`.  Don't bother to check for an error returned by
`comedi_set_hw_dev()` here; it only fails when changing a non-NULL
pointer to a different non-NULL pointer and since the `struct
comedi_device` has just been allocated and initialized, its `hw_dev`
will be NULL already.  Calling `comedi_set_hw_dev()` with a non-NULL
hardware device pointer increments the kref counter for the hardware
device.

If `comedi_alloc_board_minor()` fails further down the function, we rely
on its call to `comedi_device_cleanup()` to call `comedi_clear_hw_dev()`
(via `comedi_device_detach()` and `cleanup_device()`) to clear `hw_dev`
and decrement its kref counter.  (That's the "beneficial side-effect"
mentioned in the patch that replaced `__comedi_device_detach()`.)

Remove the call to `comedi_set_hw_dev()` from `comedi_auto_config()` as
the call to `comedi_alloc_board_minor()` does it for us.
