mwifiex: clear is_suspended flag when interrupt is received early

When the XO-4 with 8787 wireless is woken up due to wake-on-WLAN
mwifiex is often flooded with "not allowed while suspended" messages
and the interface is unusable.

This can be readily reproduced when putting the XO-4 in a loop where
it goes to sleep due to inactivity, but then wakes up due to an
incoming ping. The error is hit within an hour or two.

This issue happens when an interrupt comes in early while host sleep
is still activated. Driver handles this case by auto cancelling host
sleep. However is_suspended flag is still set which prevents any cmd
or data from being sent to firmware. Fix it by clearing is_suspended
flag in this path.
