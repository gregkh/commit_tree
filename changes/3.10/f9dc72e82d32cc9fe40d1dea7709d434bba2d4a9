s390/kvm,gaccess: shorten copy_to/from_guest code

The code can be significantly shortened. There is no functional change,
except that for large (> PAGE_SIZE) copies the guest translation would
be done more frequently.
However, there is not a single user which does this currently. If one
gets added later on this functionality can be added easily again.
