vxlan: fix race between flush and incoming learning

It is possible for a packet to arrive during vxlan_stop(), and
have a dynamic entry created. Close this by checking if device
is up.

 CPU1                             CPU2
vxlan_stop
  vxlan_flush
     hash_lock acquired
                                  vxlan_encap_recv
                                     vxlan_snoop
                                        waiting for hash_lock
     hash_lock relased
  vxlan_flush done
                                        hash_lock acquired
                                        vxlan_fdb_create

This is a day-one bug in vxlan goes back to 3.7.
