bonding: fix multiple 3ad mode sysfs race conditions

When bond_3ad_get_active_agg_info() is used in all show_ad_ functions
it is not protected against slave manipulation and since it walks over
the slaves and uses them, this can easily result in NULL pointer
dereference or use of freed memory. Both the new wrapper and the
internal function are exported to the bonding as they're needed in
different places.
