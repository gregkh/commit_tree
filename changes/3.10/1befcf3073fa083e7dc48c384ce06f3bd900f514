workqueue: introduce numa_pwq_tbl_install()

Factor out pool_workqueue linking and installation into numa_pwq_tbl[]
from apply_workqueue_attrs() into numa_pwq_tbl_install().  link_pwq()
is made safe to call multiple times.  numa_pwq_tbl_install() links the
pwq, installs it into numa_pwq_tbl[] at the specified node and returns
the old entry.

@last_pwq is removed from link_pwq() as the return value of the new
function can be used instead.

This is to prepare for NUMA affinity support for unbound workqueues.
