serial: samsung: Avoid waiting forever for TX ready

The no_console_suspend option allows the console to write to the UART
during early resume, before the serial port itself is resumed. Such
writes hang indefinitely waiting for TX ready.

This adds a check to the console putchar function to drop characters
instead of hanging if the port hasn't been initialized. That way, we
can use no_console_suspend without risk of hanging.
