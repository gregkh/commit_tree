cpuidle: add maintainer entry

Currently cpuidle drivers are spread across different archs.

As a result, there are several different paths for cpuidle patch
submissions: cpuidle core changes go through linux-pm, ARM driver
changes go to the arm-soc or SoC-specific trees, sh changes go
through the sh arch tree, pseries changes go through the PowerPC tree
and finally intel changes go through the Len's tree while ACPI idle
changes go through linux-pm.

That makes it difficult to consolidate code and to propagate
modifications from the cpuidle core to the different drivers.

Hopefully, a movement has started to put the majority of cpuidle
drivers under drivers/cpuidle like cpuidle-calxeda.c and
cpuidle-kirkwood.c.

Add a maintainer entry for cpuidle to MAINTAINERS to clarify the
situation and to indicate to new cpuidle driver authors that those
drivers should not go into arch-specific directories.

The upstreaming process is unchanged: Rafael takes patches for
merging into his tree, but with an Acked-by: tag from the driver's
maintainer, so indicate in the drivers' headers who maintains them.

The arrangement will be the same as for cpufreq.
