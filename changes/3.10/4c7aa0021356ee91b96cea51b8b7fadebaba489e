arm64: kernel: initialise cpu_logical_map from the DT

When booting the kernel, the cpu logical id map must be initialised
using device tree data passed by FW or through an embedded blob.

This patch parses the reg property in device tree "cpu" nodes,
retrieves the corresponding CPUs hardware identifiers (MPIDR) and
initialises the cpu logical map accordingly.

The device tree HW identifiers are considered valid if all CPU nodes
contain a "reg" property, there are no duplicate "reg" entries and the
DT defines a CPU node whose "reg" property defines affinity levels
that matches those of the boot CPU.

The primary CPU is assigned cpu logical number 0 to keep the current
convention valid.

Based on a0ae02405076ac32bd17ece976e914b5b6075bb0 (ARM: kernel: add
device tree init map function).
