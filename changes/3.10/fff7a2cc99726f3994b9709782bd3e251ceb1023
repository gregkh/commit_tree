staging: comedi: adl_pci8164: remove buggy dev_dbg()

The dev_dbg() messages in the adl_pci8164_insn_{read,out} functions
output the 'data' that was read/write to the device. Two 'data' values
are always printed, data[0] and data[1].

The 'data' pointer points to an array of unsigned int values. The number
of values in the array is indicated by insn->n. The number of data
elements is never checked so the dev_dbg() could be trying to access
a 'data' element that is invalid.

Instead of fixing the dev_dbg() just remove them. They are really just
added noise.
