bounce: Refactor __blk_queue_bounce to not use bi_io_vec

A bunch of what __blk_queue_bounce() was doing was problematic for the
immutable bvec work; this cleans that up and the code is quite a bit
smaller, too.

The __bio_for_each_segment() in copy_to_high_bio_irq() was changed
because that one's looping over the original bio, not the bounce bio -
a later patch renames __bio_for_each_segment() ->
bio_for_each_segment_all(), and documents that
bio_for_each_segment_all() is only for code that owns the bio.
