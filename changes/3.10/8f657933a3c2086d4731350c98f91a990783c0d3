MIPS: Quit exposing Kconfig symbols in uapi headers.

The kernel's struct pt_regs has many fields conditional on various
Kconfig variables, we cannot be exporting this garbage to user-space.

Move the kernel's definition to asm/ptrace.h, and put a uapi only
version in uapi/asm/ptrace.h gated by #ifndef __KERNEL__
