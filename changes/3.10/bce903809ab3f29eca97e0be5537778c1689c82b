workqueue: add wq_numa_tbl_len and wq_numa_possible_cpumask[]

Unbound workqueues are going to be NUMA-affine.  Add wq_numa_tbl_len
and wq_numa_possible_cpumask[] in preparation.  The former is the
highest NUMA node ID + 1 and the latter is masks of possibles CPUs for
each NUMA node.

This patch only introduces these.  Future patches will make use of
them.

v2: NUMA initialization move into wq_numa_init().  Also, the possible
    cpumask array is not created if there aren't multiple nodes on the
    system.  wq_numa_enabled bool added.
