backlight: lp855x: remove duplicate platform data

The 'load_new_rom_data' was used for checking whether new ROM data should
be updated or not.

However, we can decide it with 'size_program' data.  If the size is
greater than 0, it means updating ROM area is required.  Otherwise, the
default ROM data will be used.  Therefore, this duplicate platform data
can be removed.
