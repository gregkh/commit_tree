USB: EHCI: fix regression related to qh_refresh()

This patch adds some code that inadvertently got left out of commit
c1fdb68e3d73741630ca16695cf9176c233be7ed (USB: EHCI: changes related
to qh_refresh()).  The calls to qh_refresh() and qh_link_periodic()
were taken out of qh_schedule(); therefore it is necessary to call
these routines manually after calling qh_schedule().
