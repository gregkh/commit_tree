Bluetooth: hidp: verify l2cap sockets

We need to verify that the given sockets actually are l2cap sockets. If
they aren't, we are not supposed to access bt_sk(sock) and we shouldn't
start the session if the offsets turn out to be valid local BT addresses.

That is, if someone passes a TCP socket to HIDCONNADD, then we access some
random offset in the TCP socket (which isn't even guaranteed to be valid).

Fix this by checking that the socket is an l2cap socket.
