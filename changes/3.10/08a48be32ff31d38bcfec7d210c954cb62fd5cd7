ARM: OMAP4: change the device names in usb_bind_phy

After the device names are created using PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO, the old
device names given in usb_bind_phy are no longer valid causing the musb
controller not to get the phy reference. Updated the usb_bind_phy with
the new device names to get MUSB functional in omap4 panda.
