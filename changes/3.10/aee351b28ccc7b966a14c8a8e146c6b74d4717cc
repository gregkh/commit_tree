staging: comedi: addi_apci_*: replace ADDIDATA_OLD with AMCC

PCI vendor ID 0x10e8 is assigned to Applied Micro Circuits Corporation
(recently AppliedMicro, but AMCC on NASDAQ).  The ID currently appears
as `PCI_VENDOR_ID_ADDIDATA_OLD` in "include/linux/pci_ids.h" and is used
by the "addi_apci_1500", "addi_apci_1710" and "addi_apci_3120" comedi
drivers.  (It is also used by the "8250_pci" serial driver.)

"comedidev.h" defines `PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC` locally with the same value
as `PCI_VENDOR_ID_ADDIDATA_OLD` and is currently used by the
"adl_pci9118" comedi driver.  Despite `PCI_VENDOR_ID_ADDIDATA_OLD` being
in "pci_ids.h", `PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC` is a more sensible name, so change
the comedi drivers to use it.

Once several drivers are using `PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC` we'll have a good
excuse to move it into "pci_ids.h" and change the "8250_pci" serial
driver to use it.
