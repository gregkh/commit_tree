powerpc/powernv: Properly drop characters if console is closed

If the firmware returns an error such as "closed" (or hardware
error), we should drop characters.

Currently we only do that when a firmware compatible with OPAL v2
APIs is detected, in the code that calls opal_console_write_buffer_space(),
which didn't exist with OPAL v1 (or didn't work).

However, when enabling early debug consoles, the flag indicating
that v2 is supported isn't set yet, causing us, in case of errors
or closed console, to spin forever.
