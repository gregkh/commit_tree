ALSA: hda/via - Disable broken dynamic power control

Since the transition to the generic parser, the actual routes used
there don't match always with the assumed static paths in some
set_widgets_power_state callbacks.  This results in the wrong power
setup in the end.  As a temporary workaround, we need to disable the
calls together with the non-functional dynamic power control enum.
