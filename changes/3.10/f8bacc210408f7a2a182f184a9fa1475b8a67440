cfg80211: clean up mesh plink station change API

Make the ability to leave the plink_state unchanged not use a
magic -1 variable that isn't in the enum, but an explicit change
flag; reject invalid plink states or actions and move the needed
constants for plink actions to the right header file. Also
reject plink_state changes for non-mesh interfaces.
