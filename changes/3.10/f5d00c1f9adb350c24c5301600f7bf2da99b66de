tick: Remove useless timekeeping duty attribution to broadcast source

Since 7300711e ("clockevents: broadcast fixup possible waiters"),
the timekeeping duty is assigned to the CPU that handles the tick
broadcast clock device by the time it is set in one shot mode.

This is an issue in full dynticks mode where the timekeeping duty
must stay handled by the boot CPU for now. Otherwise it prevents
secondary CPUs from offlining and this breaks
suspend/shutdown/reboot/...

As it appears there is no reason for this timekeeping duty to be
moved to the broadcast CPU, besides nothing prevent it from being
later re-assigned to another target, let's simply remove it.
