ARM: msm: Wait for timer clear to complete

Without looping on the status bit, there is no way to guarantee
that a clear of the timer has actually completed. This can cause
us to enable the timer before the count has cleared and miss a
timer interrupt. To simplify this patch, remove the timer
register setup done during timer init, since it's duplicate work
that is eventually done in the set_next_event() callback.
