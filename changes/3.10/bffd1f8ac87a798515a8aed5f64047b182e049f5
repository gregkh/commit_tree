thermal: exynos: Adapt to temperature emulation core thermal framework

This removes the driver specific sysfs support of the temperature
emulation and uses the newly added core thermal framework for thermal
emulation. An exynos platform specific handler is added to support this.

In this patch, the exynos senor(tmu) related code and exynos framework
related (thermal zone, cooling devices) code are intentionally kept separate.
So an emulated function pointer is passed from sensor to framework. This is
beneficial in adding more sensor support using the same framework code
which is an ongoing work. The goal is to finally split them totally. Even
the existing read_temperature also follows the same execution method.
