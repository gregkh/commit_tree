x86: Make Linux guest support optional

Put all config options needed to run Linux as a guest behind a
CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST menu so that they don't get built-in by default
but be selectable by the user. Also, make all units which depend on
x86_hyper, depend on this new symbol so that compilation doesn't fail
when CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST is disabled but those units assume its
presence.

Sort options in the new HYPERVISOR_GUEST menu, adapt config text and
drop redundant select.
