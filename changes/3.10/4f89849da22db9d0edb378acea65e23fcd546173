frontswap: get rid of swap_lock dependency

Frontswap initialization routine depends on swap_lock, which want to be
atomic about frontswap's first appearance.  IOW, frontswap is not present
and will fail all calls OR frontswap is fully functional but if new
swap_info_struct isn't registered by enable_swap_info, swap subsystem
doesn't start I/O so there is no race between init procedure and page I/O
working on frontswap.

So let's remove unnecessary swap_lock dependency.
