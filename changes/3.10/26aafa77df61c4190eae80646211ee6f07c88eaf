spi: mxs-spi: move to use generic DMA helper

With the generic DMA device tree helper supported by mxs-dma driver,
client devices only need to call dma_request_slave_channel() for
requesting a DMA channel from dmaengine.

Since mxs is a DT only platform now, along with the changes, the non-DT
case handling in probe function also gets removed.
