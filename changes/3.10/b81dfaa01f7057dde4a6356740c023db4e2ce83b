i2c: mux: Add i2c-arb-gpio-challenge 'mux' driver

The i2c-arb-gpio-challenge driver implements an I2C arbitration scheme
where masters need to claim the bus with a GPIO before they can start
a transaction.  This should generally only be used when standard I2C
multimaster isn't appropriate for some reason (errata/bugs).

This driver is based on code that Simon Glass added to the i2c-s3c2410
driver in the Chrome OS kernel 3.4 tree.  The current incarnation as a
mux driver is as suggested by Grant Likely.  See
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1877311/> for some history.
