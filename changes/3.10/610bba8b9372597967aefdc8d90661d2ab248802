dm thin: fix metadata dev resize detection

Fix detection of the need to resize the dm thin metadata device.

The code incorrectly tried to extend the metadata device when it
didn't need to due to a merging error with patch 24347e9 ("dm thin:
detect metadata device resizing").

  device-mapper: transaction manager: couldn't open metadata space map
  device-mapper: thin metadata: tm_open_with_sm failed
  device-mapper: thin: aborting transaction failed
  device-mapper: thin: switching pool to failure mode
