rtl8187se: Use a dir under /proc/net/r8180/

Create a dir under /proc/net/r8180/ named for the device and create that
device's files under there.  This means that there won't be a problem for
multiple devices in the system (if such is possible) and it means we don't
need to save the 'device directory' PDE any more as we can just do a proc
subtree removal.
