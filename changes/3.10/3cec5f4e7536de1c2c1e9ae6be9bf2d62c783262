mfd: da9055: Change irq state to default

This patch changes the irq state from high to the now default low.
Because the default PMIC irq state of DA9055 got changed from high to low.
This change should not affect any of the existing users since all of them
use active low state.

This patch has been tested on smdkv6410.
