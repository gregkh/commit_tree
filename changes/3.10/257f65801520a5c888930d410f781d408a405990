staging: vt6656: Fix stuck in scanning with variable uScanChannel.

When pMgmt->uScanChannel > pDevice->byMaxChannel scanning ends
but no SIOCGIWSCAN(scan done) message is sent. This section of code is
duplicate of that in WLAN_CMD_SCAN_END which sends scan done.
So remove it and jump eCommandState to WLAN_CMD_SCAN_END.

Increment uScanChannel on !ChannelValid.

At WLAN_CMD_SCAN_END reset uScanChannel to 0 when done.
