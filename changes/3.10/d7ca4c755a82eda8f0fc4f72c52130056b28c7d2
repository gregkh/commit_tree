ARM: davinci: mmc: derive version information from device name

Remove specifying mmc controller IP version information via platform
data, instead specify device name so that driver derives it from
platform_device_id table. Also change the clock node name to match
the changed dev_id.
Tested on da850-evm to make sure driver loads without clk_get failures.
