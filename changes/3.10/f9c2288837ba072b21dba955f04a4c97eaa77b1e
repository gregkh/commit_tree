netlink: implement memory mapped recvmsg()

Add support for mmap'ed recvmsg(). To allow the kernel to construct messages
into the mapped area, a dataless skb is allocated and the data pointer is
set to point into the ring frame. This means frames will be delivered to
userspace in order of allocation instead of order of transmission. This
usually doesn't matter since the order is either not determinable by
userspace or message creation/transmission is serialized. The only case
where this can have a visible difference is nfnetlink_queue. Userspace
can't assume mmap'ed messages have ordered IDs anymore and needs to check
this if using batched verdicts.

For non-mapped sockets, nothing changes.
