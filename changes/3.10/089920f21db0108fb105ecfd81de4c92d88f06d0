drm/radeon: fix write back suspend regression with uvd v2

UVD ring can't use scratch thus it does need writeback buffer to keep
a valid address or radeon_ring_backup will trigger a kernel fault.

It's ok to not unpin the write back buffer on suspend as it leave in
gtt and thus does not need eviction.

v2: Fix the uvd case.
