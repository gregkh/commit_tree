drm/i915: wire up SDVO hpd support on cpt/ppt

Now with Egbert Eich's hpd infrastructure rework merged this is dead
simple. And we need this to make output detection work on SDVO - with
the cleaned-up drm polling helpers outputs which claim to have hpd
support are no longer polled.

Now SDVO claims to do that, but it's not actually wired up. So just do
it.
