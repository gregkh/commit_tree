drbd: move invalidating the whole bitmap out of after_state ch()

To avoid other state change requests, after passing through
sanitize_state(), to be mistaken for an invalidate,
move the "set all bits as out-of-sync" into the invalidate path.

Make invalidate and invalidate-remote behave consistently wrt.
current connection state (need either an established replication link,
or really be disconnected). Also mention that in the documentation.
