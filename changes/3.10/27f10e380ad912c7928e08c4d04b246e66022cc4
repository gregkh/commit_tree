brcmfmac: support creation of P2P_DEVICE through user-space

The current driver code creates a P2P_DEVICE through a module
parameter. This device has a dummy netdevice which is not how this
interface type is intended. This patch add proper support for the
P2P_DEVICE interface type. This requires a wpa_supplicant with such
support as well.
