spi: spi-xilinx: Remove ISR race condition

The ISR currently consumes the rx buffer data and re-enables transmission
from within interrupt context. This is bad because if the interrupt
occurs again before the ISR exits, the new interrupt will be erroneously
cleared by the still completing ISR.

Simplified the ISR by just setting the completion variable and exiting with
no action. Then just looped the transmit functionality in
xilinx_spi_txrx_bufs().
