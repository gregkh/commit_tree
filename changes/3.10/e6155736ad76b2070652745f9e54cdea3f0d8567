ext4: limit group search loop for non-extent files

In the case where we are allocating for a non-extent file,
we must limit the groups we allocate from to those below
2^32 blocks, and ext4_mb_regular_allocator() attempts to
do this initially by putting a cap on ngroups for the
subsequent search loop.

However, the initial target group comes in from the 
allocation context (ac), and it may already be beyond
the artificially limited ngroups.  In this case,
the limit

	if (group == ngroups)
		group = 0;

at the top of the loop is never true, and the loop will
run away.

Catch this case inside the loop and reset the search to
start at group 0.
