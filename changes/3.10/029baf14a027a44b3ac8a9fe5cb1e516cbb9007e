ARM: 7683/1: pci: add a align_resource hook

The PCI specifications says that an I/O region must be aligned on a 4
KB boundary, and a memory region aligned on a 1 MB boundary.

However, the Marvell PCIe interfaces rely on address decoding windows
(which allow to associate a range of physical addresses with a given
device). For PCIe memory windows, those windows are defined with a 1
MB granularity (which matches the PCI specs), but PCIe I/O windows can
only be defined with a 64 KB granularity, so they have to be 64 KB
aligned. We therefore need to tell the PCI core about this special
alignement requirement.

The PCI core already calls pcibios_align_resource() in the ARM PCI
core, specifically for such purposes. So this patch extends the ARM
PCI core so that it calls a ->align_resource() hook registered by the
PCI driver, exactly like the existing ->map_irq() and ->swizzle()
hooks.

A particular PCI driver can register a align_resource() hook, and do
its own specific alignement, depending on the specific constraints of
the underlying hardware.
