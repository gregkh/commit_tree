sysfs: Add crash_notes_size to export percpu note size

For percpu notes, we are exporting only address and not size. So
the userspace tool kexec-tools is putting an upper limit of 1024
and putting the value in p_memsz and p_filesz fields. So the patch
add the new sysfile crash_notes_size to export the exact percpu
note size and let the kexec-tools parse it intead of using 1024.

The idea came from Vivek Goyal. And a later patch will be sent to
kexec-tools to let it parse the size.
