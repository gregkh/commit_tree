ARM: KVM: define KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS unconditionally

The CONFIG_KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS symbol is needed in order to build the
kernel/context_tracking.c code, which includes the vgic data structures
implictly through the kvm headers. Definining the symbol to zero
on builds without KVM resolves this build error:
