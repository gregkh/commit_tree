ASoC: tegra: add Tegra114 support to the AHUB driver

Tegra114's AHUB shares a design with Tegra30, with the followin changes:
* Supports more (10 vs. 4) bi-directional FIFO channels into RAM.
* Requires a separate block of registers to support the above.
* Supports more attached clients, i.e. new audio multiplexing and
  de-multiplexing modules.
* Is affected by more clocks due to the above.

This change fully defines the device tree binding changes required to
represent these changes, and minimally extends the driver to support
the new hardware, without exposing any of the new FIFO channels.
