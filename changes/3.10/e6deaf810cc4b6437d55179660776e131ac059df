rtlwifi: rtl8192c: rtl8192ce: rtl8192cu: rtl8192de: rtl8723ae: Add changes required by adding rtl81988ee

This patch combines the remaining changes in the rtlwifi family to handle
the addition of rtl8188ee. A number of these changes eliminate some CamelCase
variable names, and other shorten common variable names so that long lines
in the new driver could be shortened.
