ARM: 7691/1: mm: kill unused TLB_CAN_READ_FROM_L1_CACHE and use ALT_SMP instead

Many ARMv7 cores have hardware page table walkers that can read the L1
cache. This is discoverable from the ID_MMFR3 register, although this
can be expensive to access from the low-level set_pte functions and is a
pain to cache, particularly with multi-cluster systems.

A useful observation is that the multi-processing extensions for ARMv7
require coherent table walks, meaning that we can make use of ALT_SMP
patching in proc-v7-* to patch away the cache flush safely for these
cores.
