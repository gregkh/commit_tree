arm: mvebu: fix the 'ranges' property to handle PCIe

Since 82a682676 ('ARM: dts: mvebu: Convert all the mvebu files to use
the range property') all the device nodes of Armada 370/XP are under a
common 'ranges' property that translates the device register addresses
into their absolute address, thanks to the base address of the
internal register space.

However, beyond just the register areas, there are also PCIe I/O and
memory regions, whose addresses should be properly translated. This
patch fixes the Armada 370 and XP ranges property to take PCIe into
account properly.
