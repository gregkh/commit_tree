driver core: add uid and gid to devtmpfs

Some drivers want to tell userspace what uid and gid should be used for
their device nodes, so allow that information to percolate through the
driver core to userspace in order to make this happen.  This means that
some systems (i.e.  Android and friends) will not need to even run a
udev-like daemon for their device node manager and can just rely in
devtmpfs fully, reducing their footprint even more.
