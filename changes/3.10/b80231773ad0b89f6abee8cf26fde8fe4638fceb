wil6210: sync with new firmware

Adjust driver for changes in the FW API.
Noticeable changes in the FW are:
- temperature sensing
- infrastructure for multiple connections
- infrastructure for P2P
- signal strength indication

This commit introduces only changes that are required to support same functionality
as previous firmware, no new features.
