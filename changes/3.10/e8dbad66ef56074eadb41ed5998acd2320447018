tuntap: correct the return value in tun_set_iff()

commit (3be8fbab tuntap: fix error return code in tun_set_iff()) breaks the
creation of multiqueue tuntap since it forbids to create more than one queues
for a multiqueue tuntap device. We need return 0 instead -EBUSY here since we
don't want to re-initialize the device when one or more queues has been already
attached. Add a comment and correct the return value to zero.
