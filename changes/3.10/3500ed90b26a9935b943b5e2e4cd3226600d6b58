mmc: core: wait while adding MMC host to ensure root mounts successfully

MMC hosts are added asynchronously. We need to wait until detect returns to
avoid failed root filesystem mounts.

VFS: Cannot open root device "mmcblk0p1" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6
Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
mmc0: host does not support reading read-only switch. assuming write-enable.
