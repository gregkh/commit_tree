USB: ti_usb_3410_5052: fix chars_in_buffer overhead

Use the new generic usb-serial wait_until_sent implementation to wait
for hardware buffers to drain.

This removes the need to check the hardware buffers in chars_in_buffer
and thus removes the overhead introduced by commit 2c992cd73 ("USB:
ti_usb_3410_5052: query hardware-buffer status in chars_in_buffer")
without breaking tty_wait_until_sent (used by, for example, tcdrain,
tcsendbreak and close).
