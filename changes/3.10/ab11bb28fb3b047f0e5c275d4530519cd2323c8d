ath9k: always set common->macaddr to the MAC adress of a virtual interface

In some cases it can be useful to change the MAC address of a virtual
interface to something that's completely different from the EEPROM
stored MAC address. In this case it is a bad idea to use the EEPROM MAC
address for calculating the BSSID mask, as that would make it too wide.

In one case a few devices have been observed to send ACKs for many
packets on the channel not directed at them, which results in a neat
Denial of Service attack on the channel.
