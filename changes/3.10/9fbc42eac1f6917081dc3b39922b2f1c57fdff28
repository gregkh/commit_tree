cputime: Dynamically scale cputime for full dynticks accounting

The full dynticks cputime accounting is able to account either
using the tick or the context tracking subsystem. This way
the housekeeping CPU can keep the low overhead tick based
solution.

This latter mode has a low jiffies resolution granularity and
need to be scaled against CFS precise runtime accounting to
improve its result. We are doing this for CONFIG_TICK_CPU_ACCOUNTING,
now we also need to expand it to full dynticks accounting dynamic
off-case as well.
