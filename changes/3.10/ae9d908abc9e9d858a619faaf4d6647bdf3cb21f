ARM: omap2: gpmc: Fix gpmc_cs_reserved() return value

Currently gpmc_cs_reserved() return value is somewhat inconsistent,
returning a negative value on an error condition, a positive value
if the chip select is reserved and zero if it's available.

Fix this by returning a boolean value as the function name suggests:
  * true if the chip select is reserved,
  * false if it's available
