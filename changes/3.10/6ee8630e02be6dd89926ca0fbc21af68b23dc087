mm: allow arch code to control the user page table ceiling

On architectures where a pgd entry may be shared between user and kernel
(e.g.  ARM+LPAE), freeing page tables needs a ceiling other than 0.
This patch introduces a generic USER_PGTABLES_CEILING that arch code can
override.  It is the responsibility of the arch code setting the ceiling
to ensure the complete freeing of the page tables (usually in
pgd_free()).
