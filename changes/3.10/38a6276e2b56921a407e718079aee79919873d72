drivers/rtc/rtc-tegra.c: protect suspend/resume callbacks with CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

CONFIG_PM doesn't actually enable any of the PM callbacks, it only allows
to enable CONFIG_PM_SLEEP and CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME.  This means if CONFIG_PM
is used to protect system sleep callbacks then it may end up unreferenced
if only runtime PM is enabled.  Hence protecting sleep callbacks with
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.
