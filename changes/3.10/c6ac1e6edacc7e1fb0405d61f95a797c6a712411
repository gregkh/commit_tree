metag: perf: add missing prev_count updates

The prev_count needs setting when changing the counter value, otherwise
the calculated delta will be wrong, which for frequency sampling
(dynamic period sampling) results in sampling at too high a frequency.

For non-interrupting performance counters it should also be cleared when
enabling the counter since the write to the PERF_COUNT register will
clear the perf counter.

This also includes a minor change to remove the u64 cast from the
metag_pmu->write() call as metag_pmu->write() takes a u32 anyway, and in
any case GCC is smart enough to optimise away the cast.
