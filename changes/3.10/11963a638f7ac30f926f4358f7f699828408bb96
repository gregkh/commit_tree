drm/exynos: enable FIMD clocks

Common Clock Framework introduced the need to prepare clocks before
enabling them, otherwise clk_enable() fails. This patch adds clk_prepare_enable
and clk_disable_unprepare() calls to the driver.
This patch also removes clk_disable() from fimd_remove() as it will be done
by pm_runtime_put_sync.
