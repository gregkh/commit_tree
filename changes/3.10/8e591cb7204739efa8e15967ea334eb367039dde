KVM: PPC: Book3S: Add infrastructure to implement kernel-side RTAS calls

For pseries machine emulation, in order to move the interrupt
controller code to the kernel, we need to intercept some RTAS
calls in the kernel itself.  This adds an infrastructure to allow
in-kernel handlers to be registered for RTAS services by name.
A new ioctl, KVM_PPC_RTAS_DEFINE_TOKEN, then allows userspace to
associate token values with those service names.  Then, when the
guest requests an RTAS service with one of those token values, it
will be handled by the relevant in-kernel handler rather than being
passed up to userspace as at present.
