vhost: Allow device specific fields per vq

This is useful for any device who wants device specific fields per vq.
For example, tcm_vhost wants a per vq field to track requests which are
in flight on the vq. Also, on top of this we can add patches to move
things like ubufs from vhost.h out to net.c.
