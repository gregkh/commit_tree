rbd: use rbd_obj_method_sync() return value

Now that rbd_obj_method_sync() returns the number of bytes
returned by the method call, that value should be used by
callers to ensure we don't overrun the valid portion of the
buffer.

Fix the two spots that remained that weren't doing that,
rbd_dev_image_name() and rbd_dev_v2_snap_name().

Rearrange the error path slightly in rbd_dev_v2_snap_name().
