sched: Avoid cputime scaling overflow

Here is patch, which adds Linus's cputime scaling algorithm to the
kernel.

This is a follow up (well, fix) to commit
d9a3c9823a2e6a543eb7807fb3d15d8233817ec5 ("sched: Lower chances
of cputime scaling overflow") which commit tried to avoid
multiplication overflow, but did not guarantee that the overflow
would not happen.

Linus crated a different algorithm, which completely avoids the
multiplication overflow by dropping precision when numbers are
big.

It was tested by me and it gives good relative error of
scaled numbers. Testing method is described here:
