perf/x86/intel/lbr: Fix LBR filter

The LBR 'from' adddress is under full userspace control; ensure
we validate it before reading from it.

Note: is_module_text_address() can potentially be quite
expensive; for those running into that with high overhead
in modules optimize it using an RCU backed rb-tree.
