sh-pfc: Make GPIO support optional

When implemented as a separate IP block, GPIOs should be handled by a
separate driver. To make this possible GPIO support needs to be optional
in the sh-pfc driver.

If no GPIO data registers are supplied in the SoC information structure
skip registration of the gpiochip.
