PCI/ACPI: Prepare stub functions to handle ACPI PCI (hotplug) slots

Prepare two stub functions to handle ACPI PCI slots and ACPI PCI hotplug
slots, which will be invoked by the PCI core when creating/destroying
PCI buses.

It will be used to get rid of ACPI PCI subdrivers for pci_slot and
acpiphp, and eventually remove the ACPI PCI subdriver mechanism.

And it will also be used to handle ACPI PCI (hotplug) slots in a unified
way, both at boot time and for PCI hotplug operations.
