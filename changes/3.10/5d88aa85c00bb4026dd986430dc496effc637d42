powerpc/pseries: Update CPU maps when device tree is updated

Platform events such as partition migration or the new PRRN firmware
feature can cause the NUMA characteristics of a CPU to change, and these
changes will be reflected in the device tree nodes for the affected
CPUs.

This patch registers a handler for Open Firmware device tree updates
and reconfigures the CPU and node maps whenever the associativity
changes. Currently, this is accomplished by marking the affected CPUs in
the cpu_associativity_changes_mask and allowing
arch_update_cpu_topology() to retrieve the new associativity information
using hcall_vphn().

Protecting the NUMA cpu maps from concurrent access during an update
operation will be addressed in a subsequent patch in this series.
