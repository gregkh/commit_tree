ARM: SAMSUNG: change GENERIC_GPIO to ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB

When I applied regarding samsung-time patches, the "select GENERIC_GPIO"
has been added wrong, so this patch fixes that.
And since the GENERIC_GPIO in arch/arm/ will be gone away, this adds
ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB for S3C24XX and S5PC100 instead.
