btrfs: make static code static & remove dead code

Big patch, but all it does is add statics to functions which
are in fact static, then remove the associated dead-code fallout.

removed functions:

btrfs_iref_to_path()
__btrfs_lookup_delayed_deletion_item()
__btrfs_search_delayed_insertion_item()
__btrfs_search_delayed_deletion_item()
find_eb_for_page()
btrfs_find_block_group()
range_straddles_pages()
extent_range_uptodate()
btrfs_file_extent_length()
btrfs_scrub_cancel_devid()
btrfs_start_transaction_lflush()

btrfs_print_tree() is left because it is used for debugging.
btrfs_start_transaction_lflush() and btrfs_reada_detach() are
left for symmetry.

ulist.c functions are left, another patch will take care of those.
