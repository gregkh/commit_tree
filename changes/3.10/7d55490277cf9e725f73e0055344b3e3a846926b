arm: mach-dove: convert to use mvebu-mbus driver

This commit migrates the mach-dove platforms to use the mvebu-mbus
driver and therefore removes the Dove-specific addr-map code.

The dove_init_early() function now initializes the mvebu-mbus driver
by calling mvebu_mbus_init().

The address decoding windows are now registered in the
dove_setup_cpu_wins() function. It is worth noting that the four PCIe
address decoding windows will ultimately no longer have to be
registered here: it will be done automatically by the PCIe driver once
Dove has been migrated to use the upcoming mvebu PCIe driver.
