Bluetooth: btmrvl: fix thread stopping race

There is currently a race condition in the btmrvl_remove_card() which
is causing hangs on suspend for OLPC. When the race occurs,
kthread_stop() never returns.

The problem is that btmrvl_service_main_thread() calls kthread_should_stop()
and then does a fair number of things before restarting the loop and
sleeping.

If the thread gets stopped after kthread_should_stop() is checked, but
before the sleep happens, the thread will go to sleep and won't necessarily
be woken up.

Move the kthread_should_stop() check into a race-free place.
