[media] drivers/staging: davinci: vpfe: fix dependency for building the driver

from commit 3778d05036cc7ddd983ae2451da579af00acdac2
[media: davinci: kconfig: fix incorrect selects]
VIDEO_VPFE_CAPTURE was removed but there was a negative
dependancy for building the DM365 VPFE MC based capture driver
(VIDEO_DM365_VPFE), This patch fixes this dependency by replacing
the VIDEO_VPFE_CAPTURE with VIDEO_DM365_ISIF, so as when older DM365
ISIF v4l driver is selected the newer media controller driver for
DM365 isnt visible.
