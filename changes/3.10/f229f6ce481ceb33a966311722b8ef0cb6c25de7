netfilter: add my copyright statements

Add copyright statements to all netfilter files which have had significant
changes done by myself in the past.

Some notes:

- nf_conntrack_ecache.c was incorrectly attributed to Rusty and Netfilter
  Core Team when it got split out of nf_conntrack_core.c. The copyrights
  even state a date which lies six years before it was written. It was
  written in 2005 by Harald and myself.

- net/ipv{4,6}/netfilter.c, net/netfitler/nf_queue.c were missing copyright
  statements. I've added the copyright statement from net/netfilter/core.c,
  where this code originated

- for nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c I've also added Jozsef, since I didn't want
  it to give the wrong impression
