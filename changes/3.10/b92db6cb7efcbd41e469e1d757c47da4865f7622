rcu: Rearrange locking in rcu_start_gp()

If CPUs are to give prior notice of needed grace periods, it will be
necessary to invoke rcu_start_gp() without dropping the root rcu_node
structure's ->lock.  This commit takes a first step in this direction
by moving the release of this lock to the end of rcu_start_gp().
