ARM: at91: suspend both memory controllers on at91sam9263

For the past three years, we have had a #warning in
mach-at91 about the sdram_selfrefresh_enable or
at91sam9_standby functions possibly not working on
at91sam9263. In the meantime a function was added
to do the right thing on at91sam9g45, which looks like
it should also work on '9263.
