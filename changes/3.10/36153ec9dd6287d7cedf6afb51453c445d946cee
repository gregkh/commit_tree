libceph: move cursor into message

A message will only be processing a single data item at a time, so
there's no need for each data item to have its own cursor.

Move the cursor embedded in the message data structure into the
message itself.  To minimize the impact, keep the data->cursor
field, but make it be a pointer to the cursor in the message.

Move the definition of ceph_msg_data above ceph_msg_data_cursor so
the cursor can point to the data without a forward definition rather
than vice-versa.
