USB: adds comment on suspend callback

This patch adds comments on interface driver suspend callback
to emphasize that the failure return value is ignored by
USB core in system sleep context, so do not try to recover
device for this case and let resume/reset_resume callback
handle the suspend failure if needed.

Also kerneldoc for usb_suspend_both() is updated with the
fact.
