usb: dwc3: gadget: free trb pool only from epnum 2

we never allocate a TRB pool for physical endpoints
0 and 1 so trying to free it (a invalid TRB pool pointer)
will lead us in a warning while removing dwc3.ko module.

In order to fix the situation, all we have to do is skip
dwc3_free_trb_pool() for physical endpoints 0 and 1 just
as we while deleting endpoints from the endpoints list.
