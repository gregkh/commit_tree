arm64: add support for 8250/16550 earlyprintk

This patch adds support for using earlyprintk with 8250/16550 UART
ports. The 8250/16550 UART can either have 8-bit or 32-bit aligned
registers which is HW vendor dependent.

Kernel args for 8-bit aligned regs: earlyprintk=uart8250-8bit,<phys_address>

Kernel args for 32-bit aligned regs: earlyprintk=uart8250-32bit,<phys_address>
