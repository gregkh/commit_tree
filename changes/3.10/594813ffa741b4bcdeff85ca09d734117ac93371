ALSA: hda - Don't call vmaster hook when bus->shutdown is set

The flag bus->shutdown implies that the control elements might have
been already destroyed.  When a codec is resumed at this state and
tries to call vmaster hook (e.g. in snd_hda_gen_init()), it would
refer to a non-existing object, resulting in Oops in the end.

This patch just adds a check of the flag in the caller side for
avoiding such a crash.

Though, the best would be to clear hook->sw_kctl by the destructor of
the corresponding ctl element, but vmaster uses its own private_free,
it can't be done easily.  So let it be for a while.
