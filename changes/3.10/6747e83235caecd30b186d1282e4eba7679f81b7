powerpc/spufs: Initialise inode->i_ino in spufs_new_inode()

In commit 85fe402 (fs: do not assign default i_ino in new_inode), the
initialisation of i_ino was removed from new_inode() and pushed down
into the callers. However spufs_new_inode() was not updated.

This exhibits as no files appearing in /spu, because all our dirents
have a zero inode, which readdir() seems to dislike.
