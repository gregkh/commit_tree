mrf24j40: Enable link-layer acknowledgement and retry

On the MRF24J40, link-layer acknowledgment request and retry must be
turned on explicitly for each packet.  Turn this on in the hardware based
on the FC_ACK_REQ bit being set in the packet.

Also, now that failure to receive an ACK will cause the hardware to report
failure of transmission, change the log level for this failure to debug
level.
