s390/mem_detect: limit memory detection loop to "mem=" parameter

The current memory detection loop will detect all present memory of
a machine. This is true even if the user specified the "mem=" parameter
on the kernel command line.
This can be a problem since the memory detection may cause a fully
populated host page table for the guest, even for those parts of the
memory that the guest will never use afterwards.

So fix this and only detect memory up to a user supplied "mem=" limit
if specified.
