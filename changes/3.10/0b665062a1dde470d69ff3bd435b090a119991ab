regulator: ab8500: Don't update lp_mode_req flag in set_mode() error paths

Currently, set invalid mode setting for shared mode regulators may change
sm->lp_mode_req flag. This patch ensures we don't set lp_mode_req flag to wrong
status if set_mode() fails.

This patch includes some clean up, and these changes makes this patch looks like
code refactor. The clean up is mainly to avoid adding ugly code to handle
failure paths.
