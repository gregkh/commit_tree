mlx4_core: Reduce warning message for SRQ_LIMIT event to debug level

Commit acba2420f9d2 ("mlx4_core: Add wrapper functions and comm
channel and slave event support to EQs") introduced a warning printout
for SRQ LIMIT events.

This warning can flood the log when (correct, normally operating) apps
use SRQ LIMIT events as a trigger to post WQEs to SRQs.  Reduce the
warning message to be a debug printout.
