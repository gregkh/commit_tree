x86/PCI: Map PCI setup data with ioremap() so it can be in highmem

f9a37be0f0 ("x86: Use PCI setup data") added support for using PCI ROM
images from setup_data.  This used phys_to_virt(), which is not valid for
highmem addresses, and can cause a crash when booting a 32-bit kernel via
the EFI boot stub.

pcibios_add_device() assumes that the physical addresses stored in
setup_data are accessible via the direct kernel mapping, and that calling
phys_to_virt() is valid.  This isn't guaranteed to be true on x86 where the
direct mapping range is much smaller than on x86-64.

Calling phys_to_virt() on a highmem address results in the following:

 BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 39a3c198

The solution is to use ioremap() instead of phys_to_virt() to map the
setup data into the kernel address space.
