mn10300: Fix include dependency in irqflags.h et al.

We need to pick up the definition of raw_smp_processor_id() from
asm/smp.h.  For the !SMP case, we need to supply a definition of
raw_smp_processor_id().

Because of the include dependencies we cannot use smp_call_func_t in
asm/smp.h, but we do need linux/thread_info.h
