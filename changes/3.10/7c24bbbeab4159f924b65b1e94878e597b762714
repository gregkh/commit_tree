batman-adv: forward late OGMs from best next hop

When a packet is received from another node first and later from the
best next hop, this packet is dropped. However the first OGM was sent
with the BATADV_NOT_BEST_NEXT_HOP flag and thus dropped by neighbors.
The late OGM from the best neighbor is then dropped because it is a
duplicate.

If this situation happens constantly, a node might end up not forwarding
the "valid" OGMs anymore, and nodes behind will starve from not getting
valid OGMs.

Fix this by refining the duplicate checking behaviour: The actions
should depend on whether it was a duplicate for a neighbor only or for
the originator. OGMs which are not duplicates for a specific neighbor
will now be considered in batadv_iv_ogm_forward(), but only actually
forwarded for the best next hop. Therefore, late OGMs from the best
next hop are forwarded now and not dropped as duplicates anymore.
