Thermal: build thermal governors into thermal_sys module

The thermal governors are part of the thermal framework,
rather than a seperate feature/module.
Because the generic thermal layer can not work without
thermal governors, and it must load the thermal governors
during its initialization.

Build them into one module in this patch.

This also fix a problem that the generic thermal layer does not
work when CONFIG_THERMAL=m and CONFIG_THERMAL_GOV_XXX=y.
