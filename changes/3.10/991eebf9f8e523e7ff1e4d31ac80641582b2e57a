KVM: VMX: do not try to reexecute failed instruction while emulating invalid guest state

During invalid guest state emulation vcpu cannot enter guest mode to try
to reexecute instruction that emulator failed to emulate, so emulation
will happen again and again.  Prevent that by telling the emulator that
instruction reexecution should not be attempted.
