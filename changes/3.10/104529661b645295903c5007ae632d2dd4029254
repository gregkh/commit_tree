pktcdvd: silence static checker warning

Static checkers complain about widening the binary "not" operations here
because sectors are u64 and "(pd)->settings.size" is unsigned int.
It unintentionally clears the high 32 bits of the sector.  This means
that the driver won't work for devices with over 2TB of space.  Since
this is a DVD drive, we're unlikely to reach that limit, but we may as
well silence the warning.
