s390/kdump: Add PM notifier for kdump

For s390 the page table mapping for the crashkernel memory is removed to
protect the pre-loaded kdump kernel and ramdisk. Because the crashkernel
memory is not included in the page tables for suspend/resume it is not
included in the suspend image. Therefore after resume the resumed system
does no longer contain the pre-loaded kdump kernel and when kdump is
triggered it fails.

This patch adds a PM notifier that creates the page tables before suspend
is done and removes them for resume. This ensures that the kdump kernel
is included in the suspend image.
