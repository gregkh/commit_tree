tracing: Make syscall events suitable for multiple buffers

Currently the syscall events record into the global buffer. But if
multiple buffers are in place, then we need to have syscall events
record in the proper buffers.

By adding descriptors to pass to the syscall event functions, the
syscall events can now record into the buffers that have been assigned
to them (one event may be applied to mulitple buffers).

This will allow tracing high volume syscalls along with seldom occurring
syscalls without losing the seldom syscall events.
