perf: Fix mmap() accounting hole

Vince's fuzzer once again found holes. This time it spotted a leak in
the locked page accounting.

When an event had redirected output and its close() was the last
reference to the buffer we didn't have a vm context to undo accounting.

Change the code to destroy the buffer on the last munmap() and detach
all redirected events at that time. This provides us the right context
to undo the vm accounting.
