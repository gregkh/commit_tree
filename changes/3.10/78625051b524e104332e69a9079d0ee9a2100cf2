libceph: consolidate message prep code

In prepare_write_message_data(), various fields are initialized in
preparation for writing message data out.  Meanwhile, in
read_partial_message(), there is essentially the same block of code,
operating on message variables associated with an incoming message.

Generalize prepare_write_message_data() so it works for both
incoming and outcoming messages, and use it in both spots.  The
did_page_crc is not used for input (so it's harmless to initialize
it).
