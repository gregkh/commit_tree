USB: EHCI: split needs_rescan into two flags

This patch (as1662) does some more QH-related cleanup in ehci-hcd.
The qh->needs_rescan flag is currently used for two different
purposes; the patch replaces it with two separate flags for greater
clarity: qh->dequeue_during_giveback indicates that a completion
handler dequeued an URB (implying that a rescan is needed), and
qh->exception indicates that the QH is in an exceptional state
requiring an unlink (either it encountered an I/O error or an unlink
was requested).

The new flags get set where the dequeue, exception, or unlink request
occurred, rather than where the unlink is started.  This is so that in
the future, if we need to, we will be able to tell apart unlinks that
truly were required from those that were carried out merely because
the QH wasn't being used.
