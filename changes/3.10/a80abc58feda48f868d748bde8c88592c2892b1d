[media] r820t: Add a tuner driver for Rafael Micro R820T silicon tuner

This driver was written from scratch, based on an existing driver
that it is part of rtl-sdr git tree, released under GPLv2:

	https://github.com/n1gp/gr-baz
	http://cgit.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr/plain/src/tuner_r820t.c
	(there are also other variants of it out there)
>From what I understood from the threads, the original driver was converted
to userspace from a Realtek tree. I couldn't find the original tree.
However, the original driver look awkward on my eyes. So, I decided to
write a new version from it from the scratch, while trying to reproduce
everything found there.
TODO:
- After locking, the original driver seems to have some routines to
  improve reception. This was not implemented here yet.
- RF Gain set/get is not implemented.
