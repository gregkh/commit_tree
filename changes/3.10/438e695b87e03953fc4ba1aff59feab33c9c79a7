regulator: ab8500: Get rid of is_enabled from struct ab8500_regulator_info

The intention of this patch is to simplify the code.

Maintain the is_enabled flag is not trivial, it not only needs to set/clear the
flag in disable()/enable() but also needs to set the flag in is_enable() to get
initial status. The only benefit of keeping is_enabled flag is just save a
register read when set_mode(). Remove is_enabled flag makes the code simpler.

This patch also moves ab8500_regulator_is_enabled() close to
ab8500_regulator_[en|dis]able functions.
This is required to avoid a forward declaration because now we call
ab8500_regulator_is_enabled() in ab8500_regulator_set_mode().
This change also makes the code better in readability by moving similar
functions to one place.
