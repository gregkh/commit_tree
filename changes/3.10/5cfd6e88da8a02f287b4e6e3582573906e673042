brcmfmac: cleanup module information macros

The output of modinfo shows a bit of strangeness because module
information macros are used in multiple source files:

license:        Dual BSD/GPL
description:    Broadcom 802.11 wireless LAN fullmac driver.
author:         Broadcom Corporation
firmware:       brcm/brcmfmac-sdio.txt
firmware:       brcm/brcmfmac-sdio.bin
firmware:       brcm/brcmfmac43236b.bin
license:        Dual BSD/GPL
description:    Broadcom 802.11n wireless LAN fullmac usb driver.
author:         Broadcom Corporation

This patch cleans it up.
