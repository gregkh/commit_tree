vfio-pci: Use byte granularity in config map

The config map previously used a byte per dword to map regions of
config space to capabilities.  Modulo a bug where we round the length
of capabilities down instead of up, this theoretically works well and
saves space so long as devices don't try to hide registers in the gaps
between capabilities.  Unfortunately they do exactly that so we need
byte granularity on our config space map.  Increase the allocation of
the config map and split accesses at capability region boundaries.
