mac80211: pass queue bitmap to flush operation

There are a number of situations in which mac80211 only
really needs to flush queues for one virtual interface,
and in fact during this frames might be transmitted on
other virtual interfaces. Calculate and pass a queue
bitmap to the driver so it knows which queues to flush.
