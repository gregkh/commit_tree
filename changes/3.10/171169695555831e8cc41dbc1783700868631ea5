workqueue: introduce for_each_pool()

With the scheduled unbound pools with custom attributes, there will be
multiple unbound pools, so it wouldn't be able to use
for_each_wq_cpu() + for_each_std_worker_pool() to iterate through all
pools.

Introduce for_each_pool() which iterates through all pools using
worker_pool_idr and use it instead of for_each_wq_cpu() +
for_each_std_worker_pool() combination in freeze_workqueues_begin().
