s390/mm,gmap: segment mapping race

The gmap_map_segment function creates a special invalid segment table
entry with the address of the requested target location in the process
address space. The first access will create the connection between the
gmap segment table and the target page table of the main process.
If two threads do this concurrently both will walk the page tables and
allocate a gmap_rmap structure for the same segment table entry.
To avoid the race recheck the segment table entry after taking to page
table lock.
