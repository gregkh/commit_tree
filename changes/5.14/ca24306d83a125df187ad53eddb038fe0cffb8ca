bootconfig: Change array value to use child node

It is not possible to put an array value with subkeys under
a key node, because both of subkeys and the array elements
are using "next" field of the xbc_node.

Thus this changes the array values to use "child" field in
the array case. The reason why split this change is to
test it easily.
