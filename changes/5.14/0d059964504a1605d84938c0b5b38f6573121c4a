nl80211: limit band information in non-split data

In non-split data, we shouldn't be adding S1G and 6 GHz
data (or future bands) since we're really close to the
4k message size limit. Remove those bands, any modern
userspace that can use S1G or 6 GHz should already be
using split dumps, and if not then it needs to update.
