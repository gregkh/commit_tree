usb: gadget: f_uac2: add adaptive sync support for capture

Current f_uac2 USB OUT (aka 'capture') synchronization
implements 'ASYNC' scenario which means USB Gadget has
it's own freerunning clock and can update Host about
real clock frequency through feedback endpoint so Host
can align number of samples sent to the USB gadget to
prevent overruns/underruns

In case if Gadget can has no it's internal clock and
can consume audio samples at any rate (for example,
on the Gadget side someone records audio directly to
a file, or audio samples are played through an
external DAC as soon as they arrive), UAC2 spec
suggests 'ADAPTIVE' synchronization type.

Change UAC2 driver to make it configurable through
additional 'c_sync' configfs file.

Default remains 'asynchronous' with possibility to
switch it to 'adaptive'
