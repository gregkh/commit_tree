media: ipu3-cio2: Drop reference on error path in cio2_bridge_connect_sensor()

The commit 71f642833284 ("ACPI: utils: Fix reference counting in
for_each_acpi_dev_match()") moved adev assignment outside of error
path and hence made acpi_dev_put(sensor->adev) a no-op. We still
need to drop reference count on error path, and to achieve that,
replace sensor->adev by locally assigned adev.
