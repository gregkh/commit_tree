ALSA: bebob: delete workaround for protocol version 3

In a commit c4d860a0d256 ("ALSA: bebob: loosen up severity of checking
continuity for BeBoB v3 quirk"), a workaround was added for the quirk in
BeBoB protocol version 3 against the discontinuity of data block counter.
As long as seeing with sequence replay for media clock recovery, such
quirk disappears.

This commit deletes the workaround.
