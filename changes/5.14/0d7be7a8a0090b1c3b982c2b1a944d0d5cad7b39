scsi: elx: efct: Eliminate unnecessary boolean check in efct_hw_command_cancel()

clang warns:

drivers/scsi/elx/efct/efct_hw.c:1523:17: warning: address of array
'ctx->buf' will always evaluate to 'true' [-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
                              (!ctx->buf ? U32_MAX : *((u32 *)ctx->buf)));
                               ~~~~~~^~~

buf is an array in the middle of a struct so deferencing it is not a
problem as long as ctx is not NULL. Eliminate the check, which fixes the
warning.
