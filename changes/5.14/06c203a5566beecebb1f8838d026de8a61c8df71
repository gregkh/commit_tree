scsi: iscsi: Force immediate failure during shutdown

If the system is not up, we can just fail immediately since iscsid is not
going to ever answer our netlink events. We are already setting the
recovery_tmo to 0, but by passing stop_conn STOP_CONN_TERM we never will
block the session and start the recovery timer, because for that flag
userspace will do the unbind and destroy events which would remove the
devices and wake up and kill the eh.

Since the conn is dead and the system is going dowm this just has us use
STOP_CONN_RECOVER with recovery_tmo=0 so we fail immediately. However, if
the user has set the recovery_tmo=-1 we let the system hang like they
requested since they might have used that setting for specific reasons
(one known reason is for buggy cluster software).
