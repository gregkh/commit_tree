netdevsim: Implement legacy/switchdev mode for VFs

Implement callbacks to set/get eswitch mode value. Add helpers to check
current mode.

Instantiate VFs' net devices and devlink ports on switchdev enabling and
remove them on legacy enabling. Changing number of VFs while in
switchdev mode triggers VFs creation/deletion.

Also disable NDO API callback to set VF rate, since it's legacy API.
Switchdev API to set VF rate will be implemented in one of the next
patches.
