iio: adc: ad7780: convert to device-managed functions

With the devm_ad_sd_setup_buffer_and_trigger() helper, it's a bit easier
now to convert the probe of the AD7780 driver to use device-managed
functions.

Only the regulator disable requires a devm_add_action_or_reset() callback.

This change does that, cleaning up the driver a bit.
