ice: do not abort devlink info if board identifier can't be found

The devlink dev info command reports version information about the
device and firmware running on the board. This includes the "board.id"
field which is supposed to represent an identifier of the board design.
The ice driver uses the Product Board Assembly identifier for this.

In some cases, the PBA is not present in the NVM. If this happens,
devlink dev info will fail with an error. Instead, modify the
ice_info_pba function to just exit without filling in the context
buffer. This will cause the board.id field to be skipped. Log a dev_dbg
message in case someone wants to confirm why board.id is not showing up
for them.
