ASoC: wm_adsp: Let soc_cleanup_component_debugfs remove debugfs

soc_cleanup_component_debugfs will debugfs_remove_recursive
the component->debugfs_root, so adsp doesn't need to also
remove the same entry.
By doing that adsp also creates a race with core component,
which causes a NULL pointer dereference
