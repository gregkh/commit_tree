xfs: fix an integer overflow error in xfs_growfs_rt

During a realtime grow operation, we run a single transaction for each
rt bitmap block added to the filesystem.  This means that each step has
to be careful to increase sb_rblocks appropriately.

Fix the integer overflow error in this calculation that can happen when
the extent size is very large.  Found by running growfs to add a rt
volume to a filesystem formatted with a 1g rt extent size.
