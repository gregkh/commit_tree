KVM: SVM: add module param to control the #SMI interception

In theory there are no side effects of not intercepting #SMI,
because then #SMI becomes transparent to the OS and the KVM.

Plus an observation on recent Zen2 CPUs reveals that these
CPUs ignore #SMI interception and never deliver #SMI VMexits.

This is also useful to test nested KVM to see that L1
handles #SMIs correctly in case when L1 doesn't intercept #SMI.

Finally the default remains the same, the SMI are intercepted
by default thus this patch doesn't have any effect unless
non default module param value is used.
