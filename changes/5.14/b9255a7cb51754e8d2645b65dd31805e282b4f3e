PCI/MSI: Enforce MSI[X] entry updates to be visible

Nothing enforces the posted writes to be visible when the function
returns. Flush them even if the flush might be redundant when the entry is
masked already as the unmask will flush as well. This is either setup or a
rare affinity change event so the extra flush is not the end of the world.

While this is more a theoretical issue especially the logic in the X86
specific msi_set_affinity() function relies on the assumption that the
update has reached the hardware when the function returns.

Again, as this never has been enforced the Fixes tag refers to a commit in:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git
