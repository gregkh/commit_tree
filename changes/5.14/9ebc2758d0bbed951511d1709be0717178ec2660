Revert "net: really fix the build..."

This reverts commit ce78ffa3ef1681065ba451cfd545da6126f5ca88.

Wren and Nicolas reported that ath11k was failing to initialise QCA6390
Wi-Fi 6 device with error:

qcom_mhi_qrtr: probe of mhi0_IPCR failed with error -22

Commit ce78ffa3ef16 ("net: really fix the build..."), introduced in
v5.14-rc5, caused this regression in qrtr. Most likely all ath11k
devices are broken, but I only tested QCA6390. Let's revert the broken
commit so that ath11k works again.
