ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: add type to device private data struct

While this driver can already handle different device variants, the
variant information cannot be used in the driver code and therefor
cannot have different code paths depending on the device variant.

This change adds a `type` value into the `aic32x4_priv` structure, that
contains a device variant identifier, which was set when the driver was
bound to the device.
