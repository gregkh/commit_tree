ACPI: PM: s2idle: Invert Microsoft UUID entry and exit

It was reported by a user with a Dell m15 R5 (5800H) that
the keyboard backlight was turning on when entering suspend
and turning off when exiting (the opposite of how it should be).

The user bisected it back to commit 5dbf50997578 ("ACPI: PM:
s2idle: Add support for new Microsoft UUID").  Previous to that
commit the LEDs didn't turn off at all.  Confirming in the spec,
these were reversed when introduced.

Fix them to match the spec.
