scsi: isci: Use correctly sized target buffer for memcpy()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), avoid intentionally writing across
neighboring array fields.

Switch from rsp_ui to resp_buf, since resp_ui isn't SSP_RESP_IU_MAX_SIZE
bytes in length. This avoids future compile-time warnings.
