RDMA/hfi1: Remove use of kmap()

kmap() is being deprecated and will break uses of device dax after PKS
protection is introduced.[1]

The kmap() used in sdma does not need to be global.  Use the new
kmap_local_page() which works with PKS and may provide better performance
for this thread local mapping anyway.
