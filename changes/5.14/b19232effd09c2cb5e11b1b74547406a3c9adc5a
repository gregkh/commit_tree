net: bridge: mcast: prepare query reception for mcast router split

In preparation for the upcoming split of multicast router state into
their IPv4 and IPv6 variants and as the br_multicast_mark_router() will
be split for that remove the select querier wrapper and instead add
ip4 and ip6 variants for br_multicast_query_received().
