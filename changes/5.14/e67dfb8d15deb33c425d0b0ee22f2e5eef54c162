selftests: Clean forgotten resources as part of cleanup()

Several tests do not set some ports down as part of their cleanup(),
resulting in IPv6 link-local addresses and associated routes not being
deleted.

These leaks were found using a BPF tool that monitors ASIC resources.

Solve this by setting the ports down at the end of the tests.
