ARM: configs: Update the nhk8815_defconfig

The platform lost the framebuffer due to a commit solving a
circular dependency in v5.14-rc1, so add it back in by explicitly
selecting the framebuffer.

Also fix up some Kconfig options that got dropped or moved around
while we're at it.

Fixes: f611b1e7624c ("drm: Avoid circular dependencies for CONFIG_FB")
