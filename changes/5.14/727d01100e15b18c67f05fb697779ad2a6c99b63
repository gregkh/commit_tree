x86/fpu: Rename __fpregs_load_activate() to fpregs_restore_userregs()

Rename it so that it becomes entirely clear what this function is
about. It's purpose is to restore the FPU registers to the state which was
saved in the task's FPU memory state either at context switch or by an in
kernel FPU user.
