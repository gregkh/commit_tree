selftests: forwarding: Add test for custom multipath hash with IPv6 GRE

Test that when the hash policy is set to custom, traffic is distributed
only according to the inner fields set in the fib_multipath_hash_fields
sysctl.

Each time set a different field and make sure traffic is only
distributed when the field is changed in the packet stream.

The test only verifies the behavior of IPv4/IPv6 overlays on top of an
IPv6 underlay network. The previous patch verified the same with an IPv4
underlay network.

Example output:

 # ./ip6gre_custom_multipath_hash.sh
