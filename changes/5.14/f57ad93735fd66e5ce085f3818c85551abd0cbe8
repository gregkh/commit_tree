btrfs: rename PagePrivate2 to PageOrdered inside btrfs

Inside btrfs we use Private2 page status to indicate we have an ordered
extent with pending IO for the sector.

But the page status name, Private2, tells us nothing about the bit
itself, so this patch will rename it to Ordered.
And with extra comment about the bit added, so reader who is still
uncertain about the page Ordered status, will find the comment pretty
easily.
