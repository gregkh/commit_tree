ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Allow arbitrary ordering of mux entries

Some Gen 3 devices do not put all of the mux entries for the same port
types together in order in the "set mux" message data. To prepare for
this, replace the struct scarlett2_ports num[] array and the
assignment_order[] array with mux_assignment[], a list of port types
and ranges that is defined in the struct scarlett2_device_info.
