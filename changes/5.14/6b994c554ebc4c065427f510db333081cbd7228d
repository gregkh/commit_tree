ASoC: SOF: Intel: Kconfig: fix SoundWire dependencies

The previous Kconfig cleanup added simplifications but also introduced
a new one by moving a boolean to a tristate. This leads to randconfig
problems.

This patch moves the select operations in the SOUNDWIRE_LINK_BASELINE
option. The INTEL_SOUNDWIRE config remains a tristate for backwards
compatibility with older configurations but is essentially an on/off
switch.
