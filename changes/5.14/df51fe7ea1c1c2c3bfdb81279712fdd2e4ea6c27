perf/x86/amd: Don't touch the AMD64_EVENTSEL_HOSTONLY bit inside the guest

If we use "perf record" in an AMD Milan guest, dmesg reports a #GP
warning from an unchecked MSR access error on MSR_F15H_PERF_CTLx:

  [] unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0xc0010200 (tried to write 0x0000020000110076) at rIP: 0xffffffff8106ddb4 (native_write_msr+0x4/0x20)
  [] Call Trace:
  []  amd_pmu_disable_event+0x22/0x90
  []  x86_pmu_stop+0x4c/0xa0
  []  x86_pmu_del+0x3a/0x140

The AMD64_EVENTSEL_HOSTONLY bit is defined and used on the host,
while the guest perf driver should avoid such use.
