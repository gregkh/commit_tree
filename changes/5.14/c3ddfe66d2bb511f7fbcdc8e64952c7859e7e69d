opp: Drop empty-table checks from _put functions

The current_opp is released only when whole OPP table is released,
otherwise it's only marked as removed by dev_pm_opp_remove_table().
Functions like dev_pm_opp_put_clkname() and dev_pm_opp_put_supported_hw()
are checking whether OPP table is empty and it's not if current_opp is
set since it holds the refcount of OPP, this produces a noisy warning
from these functions about busy OPP table. Remove the checks to fix it.
