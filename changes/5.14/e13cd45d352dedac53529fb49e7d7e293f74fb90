vdpa/mlx5: Support creating resources with uid == 0

Currently all resources must be created with uid != 0 which is essential
when userspace processes are allocating virtquueue resources. Since this
is a kernel implementation, it is perfectly legal to open resources with
uid == 0.

In case firmware supports, avoid allocating user context.
