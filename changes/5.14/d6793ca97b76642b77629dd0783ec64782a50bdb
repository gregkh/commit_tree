RDMA/mlx5: Delay emptying a cache entry when a new MR is added to it recently

Fixing a typo that causes a cache entry to shrink immediately after adding
to it new MRs if the entry size exceeds the high limit.  In doing so, the
cache misses its purpose to prevent the creation of new mkeys on the
runtime by using the cached ones.
