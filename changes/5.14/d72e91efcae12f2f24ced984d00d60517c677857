octeontx2-af: Remove unnecessary devm_kfree

Remove devm_kfree of memory where VLAN entry to RVU PF mapping
info is saved. This will be freed anyway at driver exit.
Having this could result in warning from devm_kfree() if
the memory is not allocated due to errors in rvu_nix_block_init()
before nix_setup_txvlan().
