netfilter: nfnetlink_hook: missing chain family

The family is relevant for pseudo-families like NFPROTO_INET
otherwise the user needs to rely on the hook function name to
differentiate it from NFPROTO_IPV4 and NFPROTO_IPV6 names.

Add nfnl_hook_chain_desc_attributes instead of using the existing
NFTA_CHAIN_* attributes, since these do not provide a family number.
