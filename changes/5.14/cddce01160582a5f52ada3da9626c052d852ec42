nbd: Aovid double completion of a request

There is a race between iterating over requests in
nbd_clear_que() and completing requests in recv_work(),
which can lead to double completion of a request.

To fix it, flush the recv worker before iterating over
the requests and don't abort the completed request
while iterating.
