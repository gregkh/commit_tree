ASoC: topology: Select SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS

The indexes of the devices are described within the topology file, it is a
possibility that the topology encodes invalid indexes when DYNAMIC_MINORS
is not enabled in kernel:

 #define SNDRV_MINOR_COMPRESS		2	/* 2 - 3 */
 #define SNDRV_MINOR_HWDEP		4	/* 4 - 7 */
 #define SNDRV_MINOR_RAWMIDI		8	/* 8 - 15 */
 #define SNDRV_MINOR_PCM_PLAYBACK	16	/* 16 - 23 */
 #define SNDRV_MINOR_PCM_CAPTURE	24	/* 24 - 31 */

If the topology assigns an index greater than 7 for PLAYBACK/CAPTURE PCM
then there will be minor number collision.

As an example:
card0 creates a capture PCM with index 10 -> minor = 34
card1 creates compress device with index 0 -> minor = 34

Card1 will fail to instantiate because the minor for the compress stream is
already taken.

To avoid seemingly mysterious issues with card creation, select the
DYNAMIC_MINORS when the topology is enabled.

The other option would be to try to do out of bound index checks in case of
DYNAMIC_MINOR is not enabled and do not even attempt to create the device
with failing the topology load.
