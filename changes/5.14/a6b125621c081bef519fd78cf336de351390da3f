MAINTAINERS: repair reference in USB IP DRIVER FOR HISILICON KIRIN 970

Commit 8de6b7edd493 ("phy: phy-hi3670-usb3: move driver from staging into
phy") moves phy-hi3670-usb3.c from ./drivers/staging/hikey9xx/ to
./drivers/phy/hisilicon/, but the new file entry in MAINTAINERS refers to
./drivers/phy/hisilicon/phy-kirin970-usb3.c.

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains:

  warning: no file matches  F:  drivers/phy/hisilicon/phy-kirin970-usb3.c

Repair the file entry by referring to the right location.

Fixes: 8de6b7edd493 ("phy: phy-hi3670-usb3: move driver from staging into phy")
