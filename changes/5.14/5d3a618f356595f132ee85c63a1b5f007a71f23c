drm/i915: fix not reading DSC disable fuse in GLK

We were using GRAPHICS_VER() to handle SKL_DFSM register, which means we
were not handling GLK correctly since that has GRAPHICS_VER == 9, but
DISPLAY_VER == 10. Switch the entire branch to check DISPLAY_VER
which makes it more in line with Bspec.

Even though the Bspec has an exception for RKL in
TGL_DFSM_PIPE_D_DISABLE, we don't have to do anything as the bit has
disable semantic and RKL doesn't have pipe D.

Bspec: 50075, 7548
Fixes: 2b5a4562edd0 ("drm/i915/display: Simplify GLK display version tests")
