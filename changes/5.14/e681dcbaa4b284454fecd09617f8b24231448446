sched: Fix get_push_task() vs migrate_disable()

push_rt_task() attempts to move the currently running task away if the
next runnable task has migration disabled and therefore is pinned on the
current CPU.

The current task is retrieved via get_push_task() which only checks for
nr_cpus_allowed == 1, but does not check whether the task has migration
disabled and therefore cannot be moved either. The consequence is a
pointless invocation of the migration thread which correctly observes
that the task cannot be moved.

Return NULL if the task has migration disabled and cannot be moved to
another CPU.
