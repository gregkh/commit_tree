ASoC: codecs: lpass-wsa-macro: handle unexpected input

Static analysis reports this problem

lpass-wsa-macro.c:1732:6: warning: Array subscript is undefined
        if (wsa->ec_hq[ec_tx]) {
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The happens because 'ec_tx' is never initialized and there is
no default in switch statement that sets ec_tx.  Add a default
case that returns an error before the array is accessed.
