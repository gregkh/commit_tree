genirq: Provide IRQCHIP_AFFINITY_PRE_STARTUP

X86 IO/APIC and MSI interrupts (when used without interrupts remapping)
require that the affinity setup on startup is done before the interrupt is
enabled for the first time as the non-remapped operation mode cannot safely
migrate enabled interrupts from arbitrary contexts. Provide a new irq chip
flag which allows affected hardware to request this.

This has to be opt-in because there have been reports in the past that some
interrupt chips cannot handle affinity setting before startup.
