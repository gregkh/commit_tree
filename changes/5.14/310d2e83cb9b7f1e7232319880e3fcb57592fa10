powerpc: Re-enable ARCH_ENABLE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCK

Commit 66f24fa766e3 ("mm: drop redundant ARCH_ENABLE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCK")
broke PMD split page table lock for powerpc.

It selects the non-existent config ARCH_ENABLE_PMD_SPLIT_PTLOCK in
arch/powerpc/platforms/Kconfig.cputype, but clearly intended to
select ARCH_ENABLE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCK (notice the word swapping!), as
that commit did for all other architectures.

Fix it by selecting the correct symbol ARCH_ENABLE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCK.
