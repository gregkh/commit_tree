can: m_can: make TXESC, RXESC config more explicit

Introduce masks for the three RXESC fields (RBDS, F1DS, F0DS) and the
one TXESC field (TBDS). Update m_can_chip_config() to explicitly set all
four fields to the 64-byte option (0x7) (and these defs are renamed to
be more concise).

This is an improvement in maintainability, and also makes it easier to
implement more flexible configuration of the M_CAN buffers in the
future.
