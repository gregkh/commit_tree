dm: Forbid requeue of writes to zones

A target map method requesting the requeue of a bio with
DM_MAPIO_REQUEUE or completing it with DM_ENDIO_REQUEUE can cause
unaligned write errors if the bio is a write operation targeting a
sequential zone. If a zoned target request such a requeue, warn about
it and kill the IO.

The function dm_is_zone_write() is introduced to detect write operations
to zoned targets.

This change does not affect the target drivers supporting zoned devices
and exposing a zoned device, namely dm-crypt, dm-linear and dm-flakey as
none of these targets ever request a requeue.
