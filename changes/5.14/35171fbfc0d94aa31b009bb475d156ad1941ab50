ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix headset mic for Acer SWIFT SF314-56 (ALC256)

The issue on Acer SWIFT SF314-56 is that headset microphone doesn't work.
The following quirk fixed headset microphone issue. The fixup was found by trial and error.
Note that the fixup of SF314-54/55 (ALC256_FIXUP_ACER_HEADSET_MIC) was not successful on my SF314-56.
