iwlwifi: pnvm: accept multiple HW-type TLVs

Some products (So) may have two different types of products
with different mac-type that are otherwise equivalent, and
have the same PNVM data, so the PNVM file will contain two
(or perhaps later more) HW-type TLVs. Accept the file and
use the data section that contains any matching entry.
