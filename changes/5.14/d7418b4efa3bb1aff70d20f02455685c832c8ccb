net/mlx5: DR, Allow encap action for RX for supporting devices

Encap actions on RX flow were not supported on older devices.
However, this is no longer the case in devices that support STEv1.
This patch adds support for encap l3/l2 on RX flow for supported
devices: update actions state machine by adding the newely supported
transitions and add the required support in STEv0/1 files.
The new transitions that are supported are:
 - from decap/modify-header/pop-vlan to encap
 - from encap to termination table
