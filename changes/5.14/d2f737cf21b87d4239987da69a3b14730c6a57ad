net: hns3: refactor queue map of debugfs

Currently, the debugfs command for queue map is implemented by
"echo xxxx > cmd", and record the information in dmesg. It's
unnecessary and heavy. To improve it, create a single file
"queue_map" for it, and query it by command "cat queue_map",
return the result to userspace, rather than record in dmesg.

The display style is below:
$ cat queue_map
local_queue_id   global_queue_id   vector_id
0                0                 341
