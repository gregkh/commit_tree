scsi: mpi3mr: Add support for timestamp sync with firmware

This operation requests that the IOC update the TimeStamp.

When the I/O Unit is powered on it sets the TimeStamp field value to
0x0000_0000_0000_0000 and increments the current value every millisecond.
A host driver sets the TimeStamp field to the current time by using an
IOCInit request. The TimeStamp field is periodically updated by the host
driver.
