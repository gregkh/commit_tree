RDMA/rxe: Fix memory allocation while in a spin lock

rxe_mcast_add_grp_elem() in rxe_mcast.c calls rxe_alloc() while holding
spinlocks which in turn calls kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL) which is
incorrect.  This patch replaces rxe_alloc() by rxe_alloc_locked() which
uses GFP_ATOMIC.  This bug was caused by the below mentioned commit and
failing to handle the need for the atomic allocate.

Fixes: 4276fd0dddc9 ("RDMA/rxe: Remove RXE_POOL_ATOMIC")
