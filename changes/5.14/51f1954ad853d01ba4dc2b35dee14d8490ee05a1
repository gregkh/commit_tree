usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix dwc3_calc_trbs_left()

We can't depend on the TRB's HWO bit to determine if the TRB ring is
"full". A TRB is only available when the driver had processed it, not
when the controller consumed and relinquished the TRB's ownership to the
driver. Otherwise, the driver may overwrite unprocessed TRBs. This can
happen when many transfer events accumulate and the system is slow to
process them and/or when there are too many small requests.

If a request is in the started_list, that means there is one or more
unprocessed TRBs remained. Check this instead of the TRB's HWO bit
whether the TRB ring is full.
