blk-iolatency: error out if blk_get_queue() failed in iolatency_set_limit()

If queue is dying while iolatency_set_limit() is in progress,
blk_get_queue() won't increment the refcount of the queue. However,
blk_put_queue() will still decrement the refcount later, which will
cause the refcout to be unbalanced.

Thus error out in such case to fix the problem.
