usb: gadget: u_audio: fix race condition on endpoint stop

If the endpoint completion callback is call right after the ep_enabled flag
is cleared and before usb_ep_dequeue() is call, we could do a double free
on the request and the associated buffer.

Fix this by clearing ep_enabled after all the endpoint requests have been
dequeued.
