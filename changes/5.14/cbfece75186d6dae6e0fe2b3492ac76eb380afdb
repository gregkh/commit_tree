ARM: ixp4xx: fix building both pci drivers

When both the old and the new PCI drivers are enabled
in the same kernel, there are a couple of namespace
conflicts that cause a build failure:

drivers/pci/controller/pci-ixp4xx.c:38: error: "IXP4XX_PCI_CSR" redefined [-Werror]
   38 | #define IXP4XX_PCI_CSR                  0x1c
      |

      |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rename both the ixp4xx_pci_read/ixp4xx_pci_write functions and the
IXP4XX_PCI_CSR macro. In each case, I went with the version that
has fewer callers to keep the change small.
