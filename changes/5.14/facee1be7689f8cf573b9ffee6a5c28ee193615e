KVM: arm64: Fix off-by-one in range_is_memory

Hyp checks whether an address range only covers RAM by checking the
start/endpoints against a list of memblock_region structs. However,
the endpoint here is exclusive but internally is treated as inclusive.
Fix the off-by-one error that caused valid address ranges to be
rejected.
