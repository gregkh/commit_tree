bnxt: disable napi before canceling DIM

napi schedules DIM, napi has to be disabled first,
then DIM canceled.

Noticed while reading the code.

Fixes: 0bc0b97fca73 ("bnxt_en: cleanup DIM work on device shutdown")
Fixes: 6a8788f25625 ("bnxt_en: add support for software dynamic interrupt moderation")
