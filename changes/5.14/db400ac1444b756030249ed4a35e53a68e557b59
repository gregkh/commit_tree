clk: divider: Switch from .round_rate to .determine_rate by default

.determine_rate is meant to replace .round_rate. The former comes with a
benefit which is especially relevant on 32-bit systems: since
.determine_rate uses an "unsigned long" (compared to a "signed long"
which is used by .round_rate) the maximum value on 32-bit systems
increases from 2^31 (or approx. 2.14GHz) to 2^32 (or approx. 4.29GHz).
Switch to a .determine_rate implementation by default so 32-bit systems
can benefit from the increased maximum value as well as so we have one
fewer user of .round_rate.
