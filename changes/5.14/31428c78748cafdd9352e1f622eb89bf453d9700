ASoC: component: Remove misplaced prefix handling in pin control functions

When the component level pin control functions were added they for some
no longer obvious reason handled adding prefixing of widget names. This
meant that when the lack of prefix handling in the DAPM level pin
operations was fixed by ae4fc532244b3bb4d (ASoC: dapm: use component
prefix when checking widget names) the one device using the component
level API ended up with the prefix being applied twice, causing all
lookups to fail.

Fix this by removing the redundant prefixing from the component code,
which has the nice side effect of also making that code much simpler.
