kunit: Add 'kunit_shutdown' option

Add a new kernel command-line option, 'kunit_shutdown', which allows the
user to specify that the kernel poweroff, halt, or reboot after
completing all KUnit tests; this is very handy for running KUnit tests
on UML or a VM so that the UML/VM process exits cleanly immediately
after running all tests without needing a special initramfs.
