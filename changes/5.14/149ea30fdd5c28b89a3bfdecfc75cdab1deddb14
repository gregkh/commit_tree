devlink: Fix phys_port_name of virtual port and merge error

Merge commit cited in fixes tag was incorrect. Due to it phys_port_name
of the virtual port resulted in incorrect name.

Also the phys_port_name of the physical port was written twice due to
the merge error.

Fix it by removing the old code and inserting back the misplaced code.

Related commits of interest in net and net-next branches that resulted
in merge conflict are:

in net-next branch:
commit f285f37cb1e6 ("devlink: append split port number to the port name")

in net branch:
commit b28d8f0c25a9 ("devlink: Correct VIRTUAL port to not have phys_port attributes")
