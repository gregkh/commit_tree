sched/uclamp: Fix locking around cpu_util_update_eff()

cpu_cgroup_css_online() calls cpu_util_update_eff() without holding the
uclamp_mutex or rcu_read_lock() like other call sites, which is
a mistake.

The uclamp_mutex is required to protect against concurrent reads and
writes that could update the cgroup hierarchy.

The rcu_read_lock() is required to traverse the cgroup data structures
in cpu_util_update_eff().

Surround the caller with the required locks and add some asserts to
better document the dependency in cpu_util_update_eff().
