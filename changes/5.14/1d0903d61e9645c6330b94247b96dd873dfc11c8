blk-wbt: introduce a new disable state to prevent false positive by rwb_enabled()

Now that we disable wbt by simply zero out rwb->wb_normal in
wbt_disable_default() when switch elevator to bfq, but it's not safe
because it will become false positive if we change queue depth. If it
become false positive between wbt_wait() and wbt_track() when submit
write request, it will lead to drop rqw->inflight to -1 in wbt_done(),
which will end up trigger IO hung. Fix this issue by introduce a new
state which mean the wbt was disabled.
