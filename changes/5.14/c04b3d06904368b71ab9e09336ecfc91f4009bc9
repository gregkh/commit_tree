Revert "mm: swap: check if swap backing device is congested or not"

Due to the change about how block layer detects congestion the
justification of commit 8fd2e0b505d1 ("mm: swap: check if swap backing
device is congested or not") doesn't stand anymore, so the commit could
be just reverted in order to solve the race reported by commit
2efa33fc7f6e ("mm/shmem: fix shmem_swapin() race with swapoff").  The
fix was reverted by the previous patch.
