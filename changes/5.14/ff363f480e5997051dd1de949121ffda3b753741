x86/msi: Force affinity setup before startup

The X86 MSI mechanism cannot handle interrupt affinity changes safely after
startup other than from an interrupt handler, unless interrupt remapping is
enabled. The startup sequence in the generic interrupt code violates that
assumption.

Mark the irq chips with the new IRQCHIP_AFFINITY_PRE_STARTUP flag so that
the default interrupt setting happens before the interrupt is started up
for the first time.

While the interrupt remapping MSI chip does not require this, there is no
point in treating it differently as this might spare an interrupt to a CPU
which is not in the default affinity mask.

For the non-remapping case go to the direct write path when the interrupt
is not yet started similar to the not yet activated case.
