drm: Mark AGP implementation and ioctls as legacy

Only UMs drivers use DRM's core AGP code and ioctls. Mark the icotls
as legacy. Add the _legacy_ infix to all AGP functions. Move the
declarations to the public and internal legacy header files. The agp
field in struct drm_device is now located in the structure's legacy
section. Adapt drivers to the changes.

AGP code now depends on CONFIG_DRM_LEGACY.
