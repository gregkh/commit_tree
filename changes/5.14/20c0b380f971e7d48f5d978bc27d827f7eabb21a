io_uring: Use WRITE_ONCE() when writing to sq_flags

The compiler should be forbidden from any strange optimization for async
writes to user visible data-structures. Without proper protection, the
compiler can cause write-tearing or invent writes that would confuse the
userspace.

However, there are writes to sq_flags which are not protected by
WRITE_ONCE(). Use WRITE_ONCE() for these writes.

This is purely a theoretical issue. Presumably, any compiler is very
unlikely to do such optimizations.
