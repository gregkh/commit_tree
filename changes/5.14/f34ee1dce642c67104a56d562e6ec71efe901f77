dm crypt: Fix zoned block device support

Zone append BIOs (REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND) always specify the start sector
of the zone to be written instead of the actual sector location to
write. The write location is determined by the device and returned to
the host upon completion of the operation. This interface, while simple
and efficient for writing into sequential zones of a zoned block
device, is incompatible with the use of sector values to calculate a
cypher block IV. All data written in a zone end up using the same IV
values corresponding to the first sectors of the zone, but read
operation will specify any sector within the zone resulting in an IV
mismatch between encryption and decryption.

To solve this problem, report to DM core that zone append operations are
not supported. This result in the zone append operations being emulated
using regular write operations.
