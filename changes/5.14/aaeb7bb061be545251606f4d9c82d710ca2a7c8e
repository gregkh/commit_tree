nvme: set the PRACT bit when using Write Zeroes with T10 PI

When using Write Zeroes on a namespace that has protection
information enabled they behavior without the PRACT bit
counter-intuitive and will generally lead to validation failures
when reading the written blocks.  Fix this by always setting the
PRACT bit that generates matching PI data on the fly.
