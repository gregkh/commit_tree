crypto: sa2ul - Fix pm_runtime enable in sa_ul_probe()

The pm_runtime APIs added first in commit 7694b6ca649f ("crypto: sa2ul -
Add crypto driver") are not unwound properly and was fixed up partially
in commit 13343badae09 ("crypto: sa2ul - Fix PM reference leak in
sa_ul_probe()"). This fixed up the pm_runtime usage count but not the
state. Fix this properly.
