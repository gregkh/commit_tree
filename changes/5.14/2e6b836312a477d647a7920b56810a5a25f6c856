ASoC: intel: atom: Fix reference to PCM buffer address

PCM buffers might be allocated dynamically when the buffer
preallocation failed or a larger buffer is requested, and it's not
guaranteed that substream->dma_buffer points to the actually used
buffer.  The address should be retrieved from runtime->dma_addr,
instead of substream->dma_buffer (and shouldn't use virt_to_phys).

Also, remove the line overriding runtime->dma_area superfluously,
which was already set up at the PCM buffer allocation.
