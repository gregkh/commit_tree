net: wireless: wext_compat.c: Remove redundant assignment to ps

Variable 'ps' is set to wdev->ps but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

net/wireless/wext-compat.c:1170:7: warning: Value stored to 'ps' during
its initialization is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
