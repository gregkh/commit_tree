mmc: mmci: stm32: Check when the voltage switch procedure should be done

If the card has not been power cycled, it may still be using 1.8V
signaling. This situation is detected in mmc_sd_init_card function and
should be handled in mmci stm32 variant.  The host->pwr_reg variable is
also correctly protected with spin locks.
