USB: serial: pl2303: fix HX type detection

The device release number for HX-type devices is configurable in
EEPROM/OTPROM and cannot be used reliably for type detection.

Assume all (non-H) devices with bcdUSB 1.1 and unknown bcdDevice to be
of HX type while adding a bcdDevice check for HXD and TB (1.1 and 2.0,
respectively).
