char: xillybus: Add driver for XillyUSB (Xillybus variant for USB)

The XillyUSB driver is the USB variant for the Xillybus FPGA IP core.
Even though it presents a nearly identical API on the FPGA and host,
it's almost a complete rewrite of the driver: The framework for exchanging
data on a USB bus is fundamentally different from doing the same with a
PCIe interface, which leaves very little in common between the existing
driver and the new one for XillyUSB.
