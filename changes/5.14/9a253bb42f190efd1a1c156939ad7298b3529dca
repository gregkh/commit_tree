arm64: dts: qcom: c630: fix correct powerdown pin for WSA881x

WSA881x powerdown pin is connected to GPIO1, GPIO2 not GPIO2 and GPIO3,
so correct this. This was working so far due to a shift bug in gpio driver,
however once that is fixed this will stop working, so fix this!

For some reason we forgot to add this dts change in last merge cycle so
currently audio is broken in 5.13 as the gpio driver fix already landed
in 5.13.
