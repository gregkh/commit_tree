arm64: clean vdso & vdso32 files

commit a5b8ca97fbf8 ("arm64: do not descend to vdso directories twice")
changes the cleaning behavior of arm64's vdso files, in that vdso.lds,
vdso.so, and vdso.so.dbg are not removed upon a 'make clean/mrproper':

$ make defconfig ARCH=arm64
$ make ARCH=arm64
$ make mrproper ARCH=arm64
$ git clean -nxdf
Would remove arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso.lds
Would remove arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso.so
Would remove arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso.so.dbg

To remedy this, manually descend into arch/arm64/kernel/vdso upon
cleaning.

After this commit:
$ make defconfig ARCH=arm64
$ make ARCH=arm64
$ make mrproper ARCH=arm64
$ git clean -nxdf
<empty>

Similar results are obtained for the vdso32 equivalent.
