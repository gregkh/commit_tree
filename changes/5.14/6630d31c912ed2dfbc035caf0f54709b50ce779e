cxl/mem: Get rid of @cxlm.base

@cxlm.base only existed to support holding the base found in the
register block mapping code, and pass it along to the register setup
code. Now that the register setup function has all logic around managing
the registers, from DVSEC to iomapping up to populating our CXL specific
information, it is easy to turn the @base values into local variables
and remove them from our device driver state.
