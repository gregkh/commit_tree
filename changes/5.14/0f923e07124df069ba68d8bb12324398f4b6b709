KVM: nSVM: avoid picking up unsupported bits from L2 in int_ctl (CVE-2021-3653)

* Invert the mask of bits that we pick from L2 in
  nested_vmcb02_prepare_control

* Invert and explicitly use VIRQ related bits bitmask in svm_clear_vintr

This fixes a security issue that allowed a malicious L1 to run L2 with
AVIC enabled, which allowed the L2 to exploit the uninitialized and enabled
AVIC to read/write the host physical memory at some offsets.
