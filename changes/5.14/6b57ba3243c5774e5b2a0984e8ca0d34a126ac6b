drm/mediatek: mtk-dpi: Set out_fmt from config if not the last bridge

atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() is only called when the bridge is the last
element in the bridge chain.

If mtk-dpi is not the last bridge, the format of output_bus_cfg is
MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED, and mtk_dpi_dual_edge() will fail to write correct
value to regs.
