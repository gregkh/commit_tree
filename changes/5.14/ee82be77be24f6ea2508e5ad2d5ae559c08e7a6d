staging: rtl8188eu: remove unused variables from core/rtw_efuse.c

Remove set but unused variables from within the file core/rtw_efuse.c
in the function efuse_read_phymap_from_txpktbuf, as they are triggering
kernel test robot warnings. Also, remove the local 'lenc' array as well,
as nothing is done with its values. Keep the two usb_read8 calls
however, as this patch is purely for warnings, not to change behaviour
of the code.
