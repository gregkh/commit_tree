drivers core: Fix oops when driver probe fails

dma_range_map is freed to early, which might cause an oops when
a driver probe fails.

This issue is introduced by commit d0243bbd5dd3 ("drivers core:
Free dma_range_map when driver probe failed"). It frees
dma_range_map before the call to devres_release_all, which is too
early. The solution is to free dma_range_map only after
devres_release_all.
