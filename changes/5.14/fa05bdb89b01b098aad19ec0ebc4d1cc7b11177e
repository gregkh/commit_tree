Revert "flow_offload: action should not be NULL when it is referenced"

This reverts commit 9ea3e52c5bc8bb4a084938dc1e3160643438927a.

Cited commit added a check to make sure 'action' is not NULL, but
'action' is already dereferenced before the check, when calling
flow_offload_has_one_action().

Therefore, the check does not make any sense and results in a smatch
warning:

include/net/flow_offload.h:322 flow_action_mixed_hw_stats_check() warn:
variable dereferenced before check 'action' (see line 319)

Fix by reverting this commit.
