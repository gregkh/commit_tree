cifs: Call close synchronously during unlink/rename/lease break.

During unlink/rename/lease break, deferred work for close is
scheduled immediately but in an asynchronous manner which might
lead to race with actual(unlink/rename) commands.

This change will schedule close synchronously which will avoid
the race conditions with other commands.
