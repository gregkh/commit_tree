cfi: Use rcu_read_{un}lock_sched_notrace

If rcu_read_lock_sched tracing is enabled, the tracing subsystem can
perform a jump which needs to be checked by CFI. For example, stm_ftrace
source is enabled as a module and hooks into enabled ftrace events. This
can cause an recursive loop where find_shadow_check_fn ->
rcu_read_lock_sched -> (call to stm_ftrace generates cfi slowpath) ->
find_shadow_check_fn -> rcu_read_lock_sched -> ...

To avoid the recursion, either the ftrace codes needs to be marked with
__no_cfi or CFI should not trace. Use the "_notrace" in CFI to avoid
tracing so that CFI can guard ftrace.
