ASoC: Intel: boards: fix xrun issue on platform with max98373

On TGL platform with max98373 codec the trigger start sequence is
fe first, then codec component and sdw link is the last. Recently
a delay was introduced in max98373 codec driver and this resulted
to the start of sdw stream transmission was delayed and the data
transmitted by fw can't be consumed by sdw controller, so xrun happened.

Adding delay in trigger function is a bad idea. This patch enable spk
pin in prepare function and disable it in hw_free to avoid xrun issue
caused by delay in trigger.
