KVM: x86: Drop pointless @reset_roots from kvm_init_mmu()

Remove the @reset_roots param from kvm_init_mmu(), the one user,
kvm_mmu_reset_context() has already unloaded the MMU and thus freed and
invalidated all roots.  This also happens to be why the reset_roots=true
paths doesn't leak roots; they're already invalid.

No functional change intended.
