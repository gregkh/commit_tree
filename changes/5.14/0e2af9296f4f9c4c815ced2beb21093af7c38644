xfs: improve FSGROWFSRT precondition checking

Improve the checking at the start of a realtime grow operation so that
we avoid accidentally set a new extent size that is too large and avoid
adding an rt volume to a filesystem with rmap or reflink because we
don't support rt rmap or reflink yet.

While we're at it, separate the checks so that we're only testing one
aspect at a time.
