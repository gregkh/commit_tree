drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Cleanup managing of drvdata

Let's:
- Set the drvdata as soon as it's allocated. This just sets up a
  pointer so there's no downside here.
- Remove the useless call to i2c_set_clientdata() which is literally
  the same thing as dev_set_drvdata().

No functional changes intended.
