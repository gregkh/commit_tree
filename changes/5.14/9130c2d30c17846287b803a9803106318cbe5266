net: dsa: microchip: ksz8795: Use software untagging on CPU port

On the CPU port, we can support both tagged and untagged VLANs at the
same time by doing any necessary untagging in software rather than
hardware.  To enable that, keep the CPU port's Remove Tag flag cleared
and set the dsa_switch::untag_bridge_pvid flag.
