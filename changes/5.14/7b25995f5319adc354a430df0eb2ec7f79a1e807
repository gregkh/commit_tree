of: of_reserved_mem: mark nomap memory instead of removing

Since commit 86588296acbf ("fdt: Properly handle "no-map" field in the memory region"),
nomap memory is changed to call memblock_mark_nomap() instead of
memblock_remove(). But it only changed the reserved memory with fixed
addr and size case in early_init_dt_reserve_memory_arch(), not
including the dynamical allocation by size case in
early_init_dt_alloc_reserved_memory_arch().
