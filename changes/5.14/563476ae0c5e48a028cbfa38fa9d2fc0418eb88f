net/mlx5: Synchronize correct IRQ when destroying CQ

The CQ destroy is performed based on the IRQ number that is stored in
cq->irqn. That number wasn't set explicitly during CQ creation and as
expected some of the API users of mlx5_core_create_cq() forgot to update
it.

This caused to wrong synchronization call of the wrong IRQ with a number
0 instead of the real one.

As a fix, set the IRQ number directly in the mlx5_core_create_cq() and
update all users accordingly.
