ice: Fix perout start time rounding

Internal tests found out that the latest code doesn't bring up 1PPS out
as expected. As a result of incorrect define used to round the time up
the time was round down to the past second boundary.

Fix define used for rounding to properly round up to the next Top of
second in ice_ptp_cfg_clkout to fix it.
