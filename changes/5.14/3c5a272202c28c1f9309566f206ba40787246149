PM: domains: Improve runtime PM performance state handling

GENPD core doesn't support handling performance state changes while
consumer device is runtime-suspended or when runtime PM is disabled.
GENPD core may override performance state that was configured by device
driver while RPM of the device was disabled or device was RPM-suspended.

Let's close that gap by allowing drivers to control performance state
while RPM of a consumer device is disabled and to set up performance
state of RPM-suspended device that will be applied by GENPD core on
RPM-resume of the device.
