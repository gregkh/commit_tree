kprobes: Do not increment probe miss count in the fault handler

Kprobes has a counter 'nmissed', that is used to count the number of
times a probe handler was not called. This generally happens when we hit
a kprobe while handling another kprobe.

However, if one of the probe handlers causes a fault, we are currently
incrementing 'nmissed'. The comment in fault handler indicates that this
can be used to account faults taken by the probe handlers. But, this has
never been the intention as is evident from the comment above 'nmissed'
in 'struct kprobe':

	/*count the number of times this probe was temporarily disarmed */
	unsigned long nmissed;
