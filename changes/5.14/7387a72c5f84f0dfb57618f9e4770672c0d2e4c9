tipc: call tipc_wait_for_connect only when dlen is not 0

__tipc_sendmsg() is called to send SYN packet by either tipc_sendmsg()
or tipc_connect(). The difference is in tipc_connect(), it will call
tipc_wait_for_connect() after __tipc_sendmsg() to wait until connecting
is done. So there's no need to wait in __tipc_sendmsg() for this case.

This patch is to fix it by calling tipc_wait_for_connect() only when dlen
is not 0 in __tipc_sendmsg(), which means it's called by tipc_connect().

Note this also fixes the failure in tipcutils/test/ptts/:

  # ./tipcTS &
  # ./tipcTC 9
  (hang)
