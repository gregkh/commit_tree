KVM: x86: Check for pending interrupts when APICv is getting disabled

When APICv is active, interrupt injection doesn't raise KVM_REQ_EVENT
request (see __apic_accept_irq()) as the required work is done by hardware.
In case KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE collides with such injection, the interrupt
may never get delivered.

Currently, the described situation is hardly possible: all
kvm_request_apicv_update() calls normally happen upon VM creation when
no interrupts are pending. We are, however, going to move unconditional
kvm_request_apicv_update() call from kvm_hv_activate_synic() to
synic_update_vector() and without this fix 'hyperv_connections' test from
kvm-unit-tests gets stuck on IPI delivery attempt right after configuring
a SynIC route which triggers APICv disablement.
