PCI: Add pci_reset_bus_function() Secondary Bus Reset interface

pci_parent_bus_reset() resets a device by performing a Secondary Bus Reset
on a PCI-to-PCI bridge leading to the device.

pci_dev_reset_slot_function() does the same, except that it uses a hotplug
driver to keep the reset from looking like a hot-remove followed by a
hot-add.

Add a pci_reset_bus_function() wrapper, which attempts the hotplug driver
slot reset and falls back to the parent bus reset if that fails.  This
provides a single interface for performing a Secondary Bus Reset.
