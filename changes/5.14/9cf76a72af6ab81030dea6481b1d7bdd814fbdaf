ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: fix reversed bclk/wclk master bits

These are backwards from Table 7-71 of the TLV320AIC3100 spec [1].

This was broken in 12eb4d66ba2e when BCLK_MASTER and WCLK_MASTER
were converted from 0x08 and 0x04 to BIT(2) and BIT(3), respectively.

-#define AIC31XX_BCLK_MASTER		0x08
-#define AIC31XX_WCLK_MASTER		0x04
+#define AIC31XX_BCLK_MASTER		BIT(2)
+#define AIC31XX_WCLK_MASTER		BIT(3)

Probably just a typo since the defines were not listed in bit order.
