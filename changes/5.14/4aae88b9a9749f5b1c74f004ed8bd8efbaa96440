HID: intel-ish-hid: ishtp: Add dma_no_cache_snooping() callback

Different platforms have different DMA capability, on most of
platforms, DMA support cache snooping. But few platforms,
such as ElkhartLake (EHL), don't support cache snooping
which requires cache flush from driver.

So add a hardware level callback to let ishtp driver know if cache
flush is needed.

As most of platform support cache snooping, so driver will not
do cache flush by default, until platform implements this callback
and return true explicitly.
