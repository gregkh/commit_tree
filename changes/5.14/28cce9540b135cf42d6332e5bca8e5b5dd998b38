ARM: dts: lager: Configure pull-up for SOFT_SW GPIO keys

The GPIO pins connected to the 4 Software Switches (SW2) do not have
external pull-up resistors, but rely on internal pull-ups being enabled.
Fortunately this is satisfied by the initial state of these pins.

Make this explicit by enabling bias-pull-up, to remove the dependency on
initial state and/or boot loader configuration.
