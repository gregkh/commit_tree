PCI: Increase D3 delay for AMD Renoir/Cezanne XHCI

The Renoir XHCI controller apparently doesn't resume reliably with the
standard D3hot-to-D0 delay.  Increase it to 20ms.

[Alex: I talked to the AMD USB hardware team and the AMD Windows team and
they are not aware of any HW errata or specific issues.  The HW works fine
in Windows.  I was told Windows uses a rather generous default delay of
100ms for PCI state transitions.]
