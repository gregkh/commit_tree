ovl: fix deadlock in splice write

There's possibility of an ABBA deadlock in case of a splice write to an
overlayfs file and a concurrent splice write to a corresponding real file.

The call chain for splice to an overlay file:

 -> do_splice                     [takes sb_writers on overlay file]
   -> do_splice_from
     -> iter_file_splice_write    [takes pipe->mutex]
       -> vfs_iter_write
         ...
         -> ovl_write_iter        [takes sb_writers on real file]

And the call chain for splice to a real file:

 -> do_splice                     [takes sb_writers on real file]
   -> do_splice_from
     -> iter_file_splice_write    [takes pipe->mutex]

Syzbot successfully bisected this to commit 82a763e61e2b ("ovl: simplify
file splice").

Fix by reverting the write part of the above commit and by adding missing
bits from ovl_write_iter() into ovl_splice_write().
