spi: atmel: Fix CS and initialization bug

Commit 5fa5e6dec762 ("spi: atmel: Switch to transfer_one transfer
method") switched to using transfer_one and set_cs.  The
core doesn't call set_cs when the chip select lines are gpios.  Add the
SPI_MASTER_GPIO_SS flag to the driver to ensure the calls to set_cs
happen since the driver programs configuration registers there.
