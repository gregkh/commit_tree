USB: Verify the port status when timeout happens during port suspend

On the Realtek high-speed Hub(0bda:5487), the port which has wakeup
enabled_descendants will sometimes timeout when setting PORT_SUSPEND
feature. After checking the PORT_SUSPEND bit in wPortStatus, it is
already set which means the port has been suspended. We should treat
it suspended to make sure it will be resumed correctly.
