ALSA: oxfw: fix functioal regression for silence in Apogee Duet FireWire

OXFW 971 has no function to use the value in syt field of received
isochronous packet for playback timing generation. In kernel prepatch for
v5.14, ALSA OXFW driver got change to send NO_INFO value in the field
instead of actual timing value. The change brings Apogee Duet FireWire to
generate no playback sound, while output meter moves.

As long as I investigate, _any_ value in the syt field takes the device to
generate sound. It's reasonable to think that the device just ignores data
blocks in packet with NO_INFO value in its syt field for audio data
processing.

This commit adds a new flag for the quirk to fix regression.
