ALSA: hda: Fix hang during shutdown due to link reset

During system shutdown codecs may be still active, and resetting the
controller->codec HW link in this state - based on the bug reporter's
tests - leads to the shutdown sequence to get stuck. This happens at
least on the reporter's KBL system with an ALC662 codec.

For now fix the issue by skipping the link reset step.
