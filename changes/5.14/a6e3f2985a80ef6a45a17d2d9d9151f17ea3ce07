ip6_tunnel: fix GRE6 segmentation

Commit 6c11fbf97e69 ("ip6_tunnel: add MPLS transmit support")
moved assiging inner_ipproto down from ipxip6_tnl_xmit() to
its callee ip6_tnl_xmit(). The latter is also used by GRE.

Since commit 38720352412a ("gre: Use inner_proto to obtain inner
header protocol") GRE had been depending on skb->inner_protocol
during segmentation. It sets it in gre_build_header() and reads
it in gre_gso_segment(). Changes to ip6_tnl_xmit() overwrite
the protocol, resulting in GSO skbs getting dropped.

Note that inner_protocol is a union with inner_ipproto,
GRE uses the former while the change switched it to the latter
(always setting it to just IPPROTO_GRE).

Restore the original location of skb_set_inner_ipproto(),
it is unclear why it was moved in the first place.
