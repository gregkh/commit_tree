mxser: don't start TX from tty_operations::put_char

TX is not supposed to be started from tty_operations::put_char. Line
disciplines ought to call tty_operations::put_char several times and
then do a single tty_operations::flush_chars to start TX.

Fix this in mxser by removing TX startup from mxser_put_char.
