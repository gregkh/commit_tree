net/smc: Correct smc link connection counter in case of smc client

SMC clients may be assigned to a different link after the initial
connection between two peers was established. In such a case,
the connection counter was not correctly set.

Update the connection counter correctly when a smc client connection
is assigned to a different smc link.
