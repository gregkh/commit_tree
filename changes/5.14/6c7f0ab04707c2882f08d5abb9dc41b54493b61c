perf trace: Free malloc'd trace fields on exit

ASan reports several memory leaks running:

  # perf test "88: Check open filename arg using perf trace + vfs_getname"

The first of these leaks is related to struct trace fields never being
deallocated.

This patch adds the function trace__exit, which is called at the end of
cmd_trace, replacing the existing deallocation, which is now moved
inside the new function.

This function deallocates:

 - ev_qualifier
 - ev_qualifier_ids.entries
 - syscalls.table
 - sctbl
 - perfconfig_events
