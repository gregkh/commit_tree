io_uring: don't resched with empty task_list

Entering tctx_task_work() with empty task_list is a strange scenario,
that can happen only on rare occasion during task exit, so let's not
check for task_list emptiness in advance and do it do-while style. The
code still correct for the empty case, just would do extra work about
which we don't care.

Do extra step and do the check before cond_resched(), so we don't
resched if have nothing to execute.
