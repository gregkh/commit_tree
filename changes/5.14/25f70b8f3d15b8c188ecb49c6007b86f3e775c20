pwm: tiecap: Ensure configuring period and duty_cycle isn't wrongly skipped

As the last call to ecap_pwm_apply() might have exited early if
state->enabled was false, the values for period and duty_cycle stored in
pwm->state might not have been written to hardware and it must be
ensured that they are configured before enabling the PWM.
