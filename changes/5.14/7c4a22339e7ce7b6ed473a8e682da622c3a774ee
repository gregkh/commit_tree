libbpf, doc: Eliminate warnings in libbpf_naming_convention

Use "code-block: none" instead of "c" for non-C-language code blocks.
Removes these warnings:

  lnx-514-rc4/Documentation/bpf/libbpf/libbpf_naming_convention.rst:111: WARNING: Could not lex literal_block as "c". Highlighting skipped.
  lnx-514-rc4/Documentation/bpf/libbpf/libbpf_naming_convention.rst:124: WARNING: Could not lex literal_block as "c". Highlighting skipped.
