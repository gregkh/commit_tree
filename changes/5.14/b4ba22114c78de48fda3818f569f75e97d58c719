crypto/nx: Get NX capabilities for GZIP coprocessor type

The hypervisor provides different NX capabilities that it
supports. These capabilities such as recommended minimum
compression / decompression lengths and the maximum request
buffer size in bytes are used to define the user space NX
request.

NX will reject the request if the buffer size is more than
the maximum buffer size. Whereas compression / decompression
lengths are recommended values for better performance.

Changes to get NX overall capabilities which points to the
specific features that the hypervisor supports. Then retrieve
the capabilities for the specific feature (available only
for NXGZIP).
