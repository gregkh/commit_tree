Revert "block/mq-deadline: Add cgroup support"

This reverts commit 08a9ad8bf607 ("block/mq-deadline: Add cgroup support")
and a follow-up commit c06bc5a3fb42 ("block/mq-deadline: Remove a
WARN_ON_ONCE() call"). The added cgroup support has the following issues:

* It breaks cgroup interface file format rule by adding custom elements to a
  nested key-value file.

* It registers mq-deadline as a cgroup-aware policy even though all it's
  doing is collecting per-cgroup stats. Even if we need these stats, this
  isn't the right way to add them.

* It hasn't been reviewed from cgroup side.
