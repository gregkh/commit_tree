sctp: do not update transport pathmtu if SPP_PMTUD_ENABLE is not set

Currently, in sctp_packet_config(), sctp_transport_pmtu_check() is
called to update transport pathmtu with dst's mtu when dst's mtu
has been changed by non sctp stack like xfrm.

However, this should only happen when SPP_PMTUD_ENABLE is set, no
matter where dst's mtu changed. This patch is to fix by checking
SPP_PMTUD_ENABLE flag before calling sctp_transport_pmtu_check().

Thanks Jacek for reporting and looking into this issue.

v1->v2:
  - add the missing "{" to fix the build error.
