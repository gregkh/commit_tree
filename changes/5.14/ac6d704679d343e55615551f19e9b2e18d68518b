iommu/dma: Pass address limit rather than size to iommu_setup_dma_ops()

Passing a 64-bit address width to iommu_setup_dma_ops() is valid on
virtual platforms, but isn't currently possible. The overflow check in
iommu_dma_init_domain() prevents this even when @dma_base isn't 0. Pass
a limit address instead of a size, so callers don't have to fake a size
to work around the check.

The base and limit parameters are being phased out, because:
* they are redundant for x86 callers. dma-iommu already reserves the
  first page, and the upper limit is already in domain->geometry.
* they can now be obtained from dev->dma_range_map on Arm.
But removing them on Arm isn't completely straightforward so is left for
future work. As an intermediate step, simplify the x86 callers by
passing dummy limits.
