hwmon: (max31790) Clear fan fault after reporting it

Fault bits in MAX31790 are sticky and have to be cleared explicitly.
A write operation into either the 'Target Duty Cycle' register or the
'Target Count' register is necessary to clear a fault.

At the same time, we can never clear cached fault status values before
reading them because the companion fault status for any given fan is
cleared as well when clearing a fault.
