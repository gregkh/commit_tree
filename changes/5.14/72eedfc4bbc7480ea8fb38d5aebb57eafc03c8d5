net: wwan: core: expand ports number limit

Currently, we limit the total ports number to 256. It is quite common
for PBX or SMS gateway to be equipped with a lot of modems. In now days,
a modem could have 2-4 control ports or even more, what only accelerates
the ports exhausing rate.

To avoid facing the port number limitation issue reports, increase the
limit up the maximum number of minors (i.e. up to 1 << MINORBITS).
