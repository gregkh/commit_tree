KVM: selftests: Add hugepage support for x86-64

Add x86-64 hugepage support in the form of a x86-only variant of
virt_pg_map() that takes an explicit page size.  To keep things simple,
follow the existing logic for 4k pages and disallow creating a hugepage
if the upper-level entry is present, even if the desired pfn matches.

Opportunistically fix a double "beyond beyond" reported by checkpatch.
