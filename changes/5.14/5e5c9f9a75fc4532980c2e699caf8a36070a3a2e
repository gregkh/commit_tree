thermal/core/thermal_of: Stop zone device before unregistering it

Zone device is enabled after thermal_zone_of_sensor_register() completion,
but it's not disabled before senor is unregistered, leaving temperature
polling active. This results in accessing a disabled zone device and
produces a warning about this problem. Stop zone device before
unregistering it in order to fix this "use-after-free" problem.
