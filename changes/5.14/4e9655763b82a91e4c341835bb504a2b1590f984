Revert "btrfs: compression: don't try to compress if we don't have enough pages"

This reverts commit f2165627319ffd33a6217275e5690b1ab5c45763.

[BUG]
It's no longer possible to create compressed inline extent after commit
f2165627319f ("btrfs: compression: don't try to compress if we don't
have enough pages").

[CAUSE]
For compression code, there are several possible reasons we have a range
that needs to be compressed while it's no more than one page.

- Compressed inline write
  The data is always smaller than one sector and the test lacks the
  condition to properly recognize a non-inline extent.

- Compressed subpage write
  For the incoming subpage compressed write support, we require page
  alignment of the delalloc range.
  And for 64K page size, we can compress just one page into smaller
  sectors.

For those reasons, the requirement for the data to be more than one page
is not correct, and is already causing regression for compressed inline
data writeback.  The idea of skipping one page to avoid wasting CPU time
could be revisited in the future.

[FIX]
Fix it by reverting the offending commit.
