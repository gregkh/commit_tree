regulator: Add a routine to set the current limit for QCOM PMIC VBUS

Add hooks to regulator_get_current_limit_regmap() and
regulator_set_current_limit_regmap() with an accompanying map of amperages.

This lets us use the existing helper functions to map requested current
settings to register bit-map/indicies.

This change is required to elevate the default 2 Amps set by the bootloader
to 3 Amps or indeed to constrain the value lower as the system design may
dictate.

The valid range is 500 mA to 3 A in increments of 500 mA.
