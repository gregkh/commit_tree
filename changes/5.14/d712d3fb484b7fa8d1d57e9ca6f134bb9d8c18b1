scsi: pm80xx: Fix TMF task completion race condition

The TMF timeout timer may trigger at the same time when the response from a
controller is being handled. When this happens the SAS task may get freed
before the response processing is finished.

Fix this by calling complete() only when SAS_TASK_STATE_DONE is not set.

A similar race condition was fixed in commit b90cd6f2b905 ("scsi: libsas:
fix a race condition when smp task timeout")
