net/mlx5: Allocating a pool of MSI-X vectors for SFs

SFs (Sub Functions) currently use IRQs from the global IRQ table their
parent Physical Function have. In order to better scale, we need to
allocate more IRQs and share them between different SFs.

Driver will maintain 3 separated irq pools:
1. A pool that serve the PF consumer (PF's netdev, rdma stacks), similar
to what the driver had before this patch. i.e, this pool will share irqs
between rdma and netev, and will keep the irq indexes and allocation
order. The last is important for PF netdev rmap (aRFS).

2. A pool of control IRQs for SFs. The size of this pool is the number
of SFs that can be created divided by SFS_PER_IRQ. This pool will serve
the control path EQs of the SFs.

3. A pool of completion data path IRQs for SFs transport queues. The
size of this pool is:
num_irqs_allocated - pf_pool_size - sf_ctrl_pool_size.
This pool will served netdev and rdma stacks. Moreover, rmap is not
supported on SFs.

Sharing methodology of the SFs pools is explained in the next patch.

Important note: rmap is not supported on SFs because rmap mapping cannot
function correctly for IRQs that are shared for different core/netdev RX
rings.
