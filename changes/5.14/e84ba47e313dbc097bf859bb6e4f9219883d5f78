x86/fpu: Hook up PKRU into ptrace()

One nice thing about having PKRU be XSAVE-managed is that it gets naturally
exposed into the XSAVE-using ABIs.  Now that XSAVE will not be used to
manage PKRU, these ABIs need to be manually enabled to deal with PKRU.

ptrace() uses copy_uabi_xstate_to_kernel() to collect the tracee's
XSTATE. As PKRU is not in the task's XSTATE buffer, use task->thread.pkru
for filling in up the ptrace buffer.
