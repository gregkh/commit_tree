USB: gadget: udc: fix kernel-doc syntax in file headers

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
The header for drivers/usb/gadget/udc/trace files follows this syntax, but
the content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.

This line was probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but is parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warning from kernel-doc.
For e.g., running scripts/kernel-doc -none drivers/usb/gadget/udc/trace.h
emits:
warning: expecting prototype for udc.c(). Prototype was for TRACE_SYSTEM() instead

Provide a simple fix by replacing this occurrence with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
