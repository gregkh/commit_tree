KVM: arm64: Introduce two cache maintenance callbacks

To prepare for performing CMOs for guest stage-2 in the fault handlers
in pgtable.c, here introduce two cache maintenance callbacks in struct
kvm_pgtable_mm_ops. We also adjust the comment alignment for the
existing part but make no real content change at all.
