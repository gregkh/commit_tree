drm/msm/dpu: simplify IRQ enabling/disabling

Merge dpu_core_irq_enable() into dpu_core_irq_register_callback() and
dpu_core_irq_disable() into dpu_core_irq_unregister_callback(), because
they are called in pairs. There is no need to have separate
enable/disable pair, we can enable hardware IRQ when first callback is
registered and when the last callback is unregistered.
