sch_cake: fix srchost/dsthost hashing mode

When adding support for using the skb->hash value as the flow hash in CAKE,
I accidentally introduced a logic error that broke the host-only isolation
modes of CAKE (srchost and dsthost keywords). Specifically, the flow_hash
variable should stay initialised to 0 in cake_hash() in pure host-based
hashing mode. Add a check for this before using the skb->hash value as
flow_hash.

Fixes: b0c19ed6088a ("sch_cake: Take advantage of skb->hash where appropriate")
