KVM: arm64: Remove list_head from hyp_page

The list_head member of struct hyp_page is only needed when the page is
attached to a free-list, which by definition implies the page is free.
As such, nothing prevents us from using the page itself to store the
list_head, hence reducing the size of the vmemmap.
