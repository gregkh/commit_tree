drm/amd/display: disable desktop VRR when using older flip model

[WHY]
OS uses older flip model which does not work with desktop
VRR causing memory allocations at the wrong IRQ level.

[HOW]
Checks added to flip model to verify model is 2.2 or greater when
doing any of the desktop VRR checks for full updates. This
prevents full updates when VRR changes until a mode change.
