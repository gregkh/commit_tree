ipv6: ICMPV6: add response to ICMPV6 RFC 8335 PROBE messages

This patch builds off of commit 2b246b2569cd2ac6ff700d0dce56b8bae29b1842
and adds functionality to respond to ICMPV6 PROBE requests.

Add icmp_build_probe function to construct PROBE requests for both
ICMPV4 and ICMPV6.

Modify icmpv6_rcv to detect ICMPV6 PROBE messages and call the
icmpv6_echo_reply handler.

Modify icmpv6_echo_reply to build a PROBE response message based on the
queried interface.

This patch has been tested using a branch of the iputils git repo which can
be found here: https://github.com/Juniper-Clinic-2020/iputils/tree/probe-request
