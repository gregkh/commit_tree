bpf: Fix regression on BPF_OBJ_GET with non-O_RDWR flags

This reverts commit d37300ed1821 ("bpf: program: Refuse non-O_RDWR flags
in BPF_OBJ_GET"). It breaks Android userspace which expects to be able to
fetch programs with just read permissions.

See: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/libs/net/common/native/bpf_syscall_wrappers/include/BpfSyscallWrappers.h;drc=7005c764be23d31fa1d69e826b4a2f6689a8c81e;l=124

Side-note: another option to fix it would be to extend bpf_prog_new_fd()
and to pass in used file mode flags in the same way as we do for maps via
bpf_map_new_fd(). Meaning, they'd end up in anon_inode_getfd() and thus
would be retained for prog fd operations with bpf() syscall. Right now
these flags are not checked with progs since they are immutable for their
lifetime (as opposed to maps which can be updated from user space). In
future this could potentially change with new features, but at that point
it's still fine to do the bpf_prog_new_fd() extension when needed. For a
simple stable fix, a revert is less churn.
