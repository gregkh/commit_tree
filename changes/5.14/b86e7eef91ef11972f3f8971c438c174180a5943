drm/amd/display: Avoid gpio conflict on MST branch

[Why]
Similar to SST branch, gpio conflict also needs to be avoided on
MST. Without doing so, there is a chance that gpio conflict will
occur if multiple gpio interrupts arrive simultaneously.

[How]
By mutex locking/unlocking &aconnector->hpd_lock,
we won't get gpio conflict when handling hpd.
