powerpc/64s: Fix scv implicit soft-mask table for relocated kernels

The implict soft-mask table addresses get relocated if they use a
relative symbol like a label. This is right for code that runs relocated
but not for unrelocated. The scv interrupt vectors run unrelocated, so
absolute addresses are required for their soft-mask table entry.

This fixes crashing with relocated kernels, usually an asynchronous
interrupt hitting in the scv handler, then hitting the trap that checks
whether r1 is in userspace.
