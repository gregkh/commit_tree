kvm: x86: disable the narrow guest module parameter on unload

When the kvm_intel module unloads the module parameter
'allow_smaller_maxphyaddr' is not cleared because the backing variable is
defined in the kvm module.  As a result, if the module parameter's state
was set before kvm_intel unloads, it will also be set when it reloads.
Explicitly clear the state in vmx_exit() to prevent this from happening.
