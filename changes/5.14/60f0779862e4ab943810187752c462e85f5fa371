virtio: Improve vq->broken access to avoid any compiler optimization

Currently vq->broken field is read by virtqueue_is_broken() in busy
loop in one context by virtnet_send_command().

vq->broken is set to true in other process context by
virtio_break_device(). Reader and writer are accessing it without any
synchronization. This may lead to a compiler optimization which may
result to optimize reading vq->broken only once.

Hence, force reading vq->broken on each invocation of
virtqueue_is_broken() and also force writing it so that such
update is visible to the readers.

It is a theoretical fix that isn't yet encountered in the field.
