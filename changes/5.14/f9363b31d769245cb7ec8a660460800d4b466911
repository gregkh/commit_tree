checkpatch: scripts/spdxcheck.py now requires python3

Since commit d0259c42abff ("spdxcheck.py: Use Python 3"), spdxcheck.py
explicitly expects to run as python3 script.  If "python" still points to
python v2.7 and the script is executed with "python scripts/spdxcheck.py",
the following error may be seen even if git-python is installed for
python3.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scripts/spdxcheck.py", line 10, in <module>
    import git
ImportError: No module named git

To fix the problem, check for the existence of python3, check if
the script is executable and not just for its existence, and execute
it directly.
