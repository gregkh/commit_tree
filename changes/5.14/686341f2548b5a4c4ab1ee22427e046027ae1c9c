s390/vdso64: add sigreturn,rt_sigreturn and restart_syscall

Add minimalistic trampolines to vdso64 so we can return from signal
without using the stack which requires pgm check handler hacks when
NX is enabled.

restart_syscall will be called from vdso to work around the architectural
limitation that the syscall number might be encoded in the svc instruction,
and therefore can not be changed.
