drm/i915/selftests: use vma_lookup() in __igt_mmap()

vma_lookup() will look up the vma at a specific address.  find_vma() will
start the search for a specific address and continue upwards.  This fixes
an issue with the selftest as the returned vma may not be the newly
created vma, but simply the vma at a higher address.
