powerpc/pseries: Fix update of LPAR security flavor after LPM

After LPM, when migrating from a system with security mitigation enabled
to a system with mitigation disabled, the security flavor exposed in
/proc is not correctly set back to 0.

Do not assume the value of the security flavor is set to 0 when entering
init_cpu_char_feature_flags(), so when called after a LPM, the value is
set correctly even if the mitigation are not turned off.
