net: dsa: xrs700x: allow HSR/PRP supervision dupes for node_table

Add an inbound policy filter which matches the HSR/PRP supervision
MAC range and forwards to the CPU port without discarding duplicates.
This is required to correctly populate time_in[A] and time_in[B] in the
HSR/PRP node_table. Leave the policy disabled by default and
enable/disable it when joining/leaving hsr.
