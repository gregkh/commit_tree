s390: enable HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT

In commit b02002cc4c0f ("s390/pci: Implement ioremap_wc/prot() with
MIO") we implemented both ioremap_wc() and ioremap_prot() however until
now we had not set HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT in Kconfig, do so now.

This also requires implementing pte_pgprot() as this is used in the
generic_access_phys() code enabled by CONFIG_HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT. As with
ioremap_wc() we need to take the MMIO Write Back bit index into account.

Moreover since the pgprot value returned from pte_pgprot() is to be used
for mappings into kernel address space we must make sure that it uses
appropriate kernel page table protection bits. In particular a pgprot
value originally coming from userspace could have the _PAGE_PROTECT
bit set to enable fault based dirty bit accounting which would then make
the mapping inaccessible when used in kernel address space.
