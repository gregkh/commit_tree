rcu: Restrict RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD to at most four CPUs

Kernels built with CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y can experience
significant lock contention due to RCU's resulting focus on ending grace
periods as soon as possible.  This is OK, but only if there are not very
many CPUs.  This commit therefore puts this Kconfig option off-limits
to systems with more than four CPUs.
