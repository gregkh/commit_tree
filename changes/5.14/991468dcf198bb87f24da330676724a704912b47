io_uring: explicitly catch any illegal async queue attempt

Catch an illegal case to queue async from an unrelated task that got
the ring fd passed to it. This should not be possible to hit, but
better be proactive and catch it explicitly. io-wq is extended to
check for early IO_WQ_WORK_CANCEL being set on a work item as well,
so it can run the request through the normal cancelation path.
