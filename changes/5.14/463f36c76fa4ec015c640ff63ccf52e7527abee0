s390/boot: fix use of expolines in the DMA code

The DMA code section of the decompressor must be compiled with expolines
if Spectre V2 mitigation has been enabled for the decompressed kernel.
This is required because although the decompressor's image contains
the DMA code section, it is handed over to the decompressed kernel for use.

Because the DMA code is already slow w/o expolines, use expolines always
regardless whether the decompressed kernel is using them or not. This
simplifies the DMA code by dropping the conditional compilation of
expolines.
