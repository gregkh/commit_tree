iavf: Fix ping is lost after untrusted VF had tried to change MAC

Make changes to MAC address dependent on the response of PF.
Disallow changes to HW MAC address and MAC filter from untrusted
VF, thanks to that ping is not lost if VF tries to change MAC.
Add a new field in iavf_mac_filter, to indicate whether there
was response from PF for given filter. Based on this field pass
or discard the filter.
If untrusted VF tried to change it's address, it's not changed.
Still filter was changed, because of that ping couldn't go through.
