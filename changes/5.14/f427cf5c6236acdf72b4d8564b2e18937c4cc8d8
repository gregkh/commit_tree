xfs: remove indirect calls from xfs_inode_walk{,_ag}

It turns out that there is a 1:1 mapping between the execute and goal
parameters that are passed to xfs_inode_walk_ag:

	xfs_blockgc_scan_inode <=> XFS_ICWALK_BLOCKGC
	xfs_dqrele_inode <=> XFS_ICWALK_DQRELE

Because of this exact correspondence, we don't need the execute function
pointer and can replace it with a direct call.

For the price of a forward static declaration, we can eliminate the
indirect function call.  This likely has a negligible impact on
performance (since the execute function runs transactions), but it also
simplifies the function signature.
