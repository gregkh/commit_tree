platform/surface: aggregator_cdev: Allow enabling of events from user-space

While events can already be enabled and disabled via the generic request
IOCTL, this bypasses the internal reference counting mechanism of the
controller. Due to that, disabling an event will turn it off regardless
of any other client having requested said event, which may break
functionality of that client.

To solve this, add IOCTLs wrapping the ssam_controller_event_enable()
and ssam_controller_event_disable() functions, which have been
previously introduced for this specific purpose.
