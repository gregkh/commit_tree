bpf, docs: Add llvm_reloc.rst to explain llvm bpf relocations

LLVM upstream commit https://reviews.llvm.org/D102712 made some changes
to bpf relocations to make them llvm linker lld friendly. The scope of
existing relocations R_BPF_64_{64,32} is narrowed and new relocations
R_BPF_64_{ABS32,ABS64,NODYLD32} are introduced.

Let us add some documentation about llvm bpf relocations so people can
understand how to resolve them properly in their respective tools.
