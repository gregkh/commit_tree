habanalabs: read preboot status bits in an earlier stage

On newer releases, host won't be able to trigger an interrupt directly
to the ASIC GIC controller.
To be able to decide whether GIC can/not be used, we must read device's
preboot status bits in a stage that precedes the possible first use of
GIC (when device is in dirty state).
