cifs: set a minimum of 2 minutes for refreshing dfs cache

We don't want to refresh the dfs cache in very short intervals, so
setting a minimum interval of 2 minutes is OK.

If it needs to be refreshed immediately, one could have the cache
cleared with

	$ echo 0 > /proc/fs/cifs/dfscache

and then remounting the dfs share.
