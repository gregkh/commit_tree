power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Rename fuel_gauge_blacklist to no_battery_list

As documented in the updated "Naming" chapter of
Documentation/process/coding-style.rst, usage of the work blacklist
should be avoided where possible.

Rename the list of devices which have no battery to the
axp288_no_battery_list, which also more accurately describes the
contents of the list.
