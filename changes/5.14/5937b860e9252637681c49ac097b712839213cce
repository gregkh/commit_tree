iio: accel: mma8452: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Remove() callback calls pm_runtime_put_noidle() but there it is not
balancing a get.  No actual affect because the runtime pm core prevents
the reference count going negative.

Whilst here use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() rather than open coded version.
Again, coccinelle script missed this one due to more complex code
structure.
