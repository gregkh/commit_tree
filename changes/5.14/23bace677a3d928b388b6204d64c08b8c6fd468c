habanalabs: allow reset upon device release

We introduce a new type of reset which is reset upon device release.
This reset is very similar to soft reset except the fact it is
performed only upon device release and not upon user sysfs request
nor TDR.

The purpose of this reset is to make sure the device is returned to
IDLE state after the current user has finished working with the device.
