wcn36xx: Add host resume request support

This commit is the corresponding resume() path request to the firmware when
resuming. Unlike the suspend() version which is a unidirectional
indication, the resume version is a standard request/response.

Once the resume() request completes ipv4 ARP, ipv6 NS and GTK rekey offload
stop working and can subsequently be rolled back.
