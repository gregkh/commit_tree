ASoC: rt286: Remove redundant assignment to d_len_code

Variable d_len_code is set to zero, but this value is never read as
it is overwritten or not used later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

sound/soc/codecs/rt286.c:728:2: warning: Value stored to 'd_len_code' is
never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
