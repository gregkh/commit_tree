net: switchdev: zero-initialize struct switchdev_notifier_fdb_info emitted by drivers towards the bridge

The blamed commit added a new field to struct switchdev_notifier_fdb_info,
but did not make sure that all call paths set it to something valid.
For example, a switchdev driver may emit a SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_BRIDGE
notifier, and since the 'is_local' flag is not set, it contains junk
from the stack, so the bridge might interpret those notifications as
being for local FDB entries when that was not intended.

To avoid that now and in the future, zero-initialize all
switchdev_notifier_fdb_info structures created by drivers such that all
newly added fields to not need to touch drivers again.

Fixes: 2c4eca3ef716 ("net: bridge: switchdev: include local flag in FDB notifications")
