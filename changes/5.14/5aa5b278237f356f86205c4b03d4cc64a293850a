xfs: don't expose misaligned extszinherit hints to userspace

Commit 603f000b15f2 changed xfs_ioctl_setattr_check_extsize to reject an
attempt to set an EXTSZINHERIT extent size hint on a directory with
RTINHERIT set if the hint isn't a multiple of the realtime extent size.
However, I have recently discovered that it is possible to change the
realtime extent size when adding a rt device to a filesystem, which
means that the existence of directories with misaligned inherited hints
is not an accident.

As a result, it's possible that someone could have set a valid hint and
added an rt volume with a different rt extent size, which invalidates
the ondisk hints.  After such a sequence, FSGETXATTR will report a
misaligned hint, which FSSETXATTR will trip over, causing confusion if
the user was doing the usual GET/SET sequence to change some other
attribute.  Change xfs_fill_fsxattr to omit the hint if it isn't aligned
properly.
