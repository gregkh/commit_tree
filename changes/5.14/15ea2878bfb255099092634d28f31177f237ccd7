iio: core: move @id from struct iio_dev to struct iio_dev_opaque

Continuing from Alexandru Ardelean's introduction of the split between
driver modifiable fields and those that should only be set by the core.

This could have been done in two steps to make the actual move after
introducing iio_device_id() but there seemed limited point to that
given how mechanical the majority of the patch is.

Includes fixup from Alex for missing mxs-lradc-adc conversion.
