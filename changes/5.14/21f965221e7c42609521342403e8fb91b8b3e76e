io_uring: only assign io_uring_enter() SQPOLL error in actual error case

If an SQPOLL based ring is newly created and an application issues an
io_uring_enter(2) system call on it, then we can return a spurious
-EOWNERDEAD error. This happens because there's nothing to submit, and
if the caller doesn't specify any other action, the initial error
assignment of -EOWNERDEAD never gets overwritten. This causes us to
return it directly, even if it isn't valid.

Move the error assignment into the actual failure case instead.
