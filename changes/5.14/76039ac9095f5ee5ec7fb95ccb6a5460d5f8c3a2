IB/cm: Protect cm_dev, cm_ports and mad_agent with kref and lock

During cm_dev deregistration in cm_remove_one(), the cm_device and
cm_ports will be freed, after that they should not be accessed. The
mad_agent needs to be protected as well.

This patch adds a cm_device kref to protect cm_dev and cm_ports, and a
mad_agent_lock spinlock to protect mad_agent.
