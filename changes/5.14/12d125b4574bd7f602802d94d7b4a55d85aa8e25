stmmac: Revert "stmmac: align RX buffers"

This reverts commit a955318fe67e ("stmmac: align RX buffers"),
which breaks at least one platform (Nvidia Jetson-X1), causing
packet corruption. This is 100% reproducible, and reverting
the patch results in a working system again.

Given that it is "only" a performance optimisation, let's
return to a known working configuration until we can have a
good understanding of what is happening here.
