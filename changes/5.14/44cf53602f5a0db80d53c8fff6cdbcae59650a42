Revert "usb: renesas-xhci: Fix handling of unknown ROM state"

This reverts commit d143825baf15f204dac60acdf95e428182aa3374.

Justin reports some of his systems now fail as result of this commit:

 xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: Direct firmware load for renesas_usb_fw.mem failed with error -2
 xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: request_firmware failed: -2
 xhci_hcd: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -2

The revert brings back the original issue the commit tried to solve but
at least unbreaks existing systems relying on previous behavior.
