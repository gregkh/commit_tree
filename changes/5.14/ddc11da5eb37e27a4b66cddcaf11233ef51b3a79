perf tools: Check mem-loads auxiliary event

For some platforms, an auxiliary event has to be enabled
simultaneously with the load latency event.

For Alderlake, the auxiliary event is created in "cpu_core" pmu.

So first we need to check the existing of "cpu_core" pmu
and then check if this pmu has auxiliary event.
