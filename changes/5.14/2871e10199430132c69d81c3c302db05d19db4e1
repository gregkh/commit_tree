drm/amdgpu: Don't query CE and UE errors

On QUERY2 IOCTL don't query counts of correctable
and uncorrectable errors, since when RAS is
enabled and supported on Vega20 server boards,
this takes insurmountably long time, in O(n^3),
which slows the system down to the point of it
being unusable when we have GUI up.
