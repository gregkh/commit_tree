s390/ccwgroup: release the cdevs from within dev->release()

Wiring up the cdevs is an essential part of the gdev creation. So
release them during the gdev destruction, ie. on the last put_device().
This could cause us to hold on to the cdevs a tiny bit longer, but
that's not a real concern.

As we have much less certainty of what context this put_device() is
executed from, switch to irqsave locking.
