net: bridge: include the is_local bit in br_fdb_replay

Since commit 2c4eca3ef716 ("net: bridge: switchdev: include local flag
in FDB notifications"), the bridge emits SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_DEVICE
events with the is_local flag populated (but we ignore it nonetheless).

We would like DSA to start treating this bit, but it is still not
populated by the replay helper, so add it there too.
