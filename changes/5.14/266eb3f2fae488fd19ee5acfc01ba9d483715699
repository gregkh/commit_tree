fuse: Call vfs_get_tree() for submounts

We recently fixed an infinite loop by setting the SB_BORN flag on
submounts along with the write barrier needed by super_cache_count().
This is the job of vfs_get_tree() and FUSE shouldn't have to care
about the barrier at all.

Split out some code from fuse_dentry_automount() to the dedicated
fuse_get_tree_submount() handler for submounts and call vfs_get_tree().
