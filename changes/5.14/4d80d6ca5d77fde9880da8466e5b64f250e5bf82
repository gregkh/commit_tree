genirq: Export affinity setter for modules

Perf modules abuse irq_set_affinity_hint() to set the affinity of system
PMU interrupts just because irq_set_affinity() was not exported.

The fact that irq_set_affinity_hint() actually sets the affinity is a
non-documented side effect and the name is clearly saying it's a hint.

To clean this up, export the real affinity setter.
