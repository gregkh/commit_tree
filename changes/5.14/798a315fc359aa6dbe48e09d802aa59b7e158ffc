pinctrl: mediatek: Fix fallback behavior for bias_set_combo

Some pin doesn't support PUPD register, if it fails and fallbacks with
bias_set_combo case, it will call mtk_pinconf_bias_set_pupd_r1_r0() to
modify the PUPD pin again.

Since the general bias set are either PU/PD or PULLSEL/PULLEN, try
bias_set or bias_set_rev1 for the other fallback case. If the pin
doesn't support neither PU/PD nor PULLSEL/PULLEN, it will return
-ENOTSUPP.
