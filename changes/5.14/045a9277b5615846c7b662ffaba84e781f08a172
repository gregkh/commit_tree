PCI/sysfs: Use correct variable for the legacy_mem sysfs object

Two legacy PCI sysfs objects "legacy_io" and "legacy_mem" were updated
to use an unified address space in the commit 636b21b50152 ("PCI: Revoke
mappings like devmem").  This allows for revocations to be managed from
a single place when drivers want to take over and mmap() a /dev/mem
range.

Following the update, both of the sysfs objects should leverage the
iomem_get_mapping() function to get an appropriate address range, but
only the "legacy_io" has been correctly updated - the second attribute
seems to be using a wrong variable to pass the iomem_get_mapping()
function to.

Thus, correct the variable name used so that the "legacy_mem" sysfs
object would also correctly call the iomem_get_mapping() function.
