ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Add speaker switching support

The 18i8 and 18i20 Gen 3 support "speaker switching". Add a Speaker
Switch control which can be set to Off/Main/Alt.

When speaker switching is enabled or disabled, the interface may
change the state of the Analog Outputs 3 and 4 routing and the global
mute button, so use a flag private->speaker_switching_switched to note
that those should be checked when the next "monitor other"
notification is received.
