fs: dlm: make buffer handling per msg

This patch makes the void pointer handle for lowcomms functionality per
message and not per page allocation entry. A refcount handling for the
handle was added to keep the message alive until the user doesn't need
it anymore.

There exists now a per message callback which will be called when
allocating a new buffer. This callback will be guaranteed to be called
according the order of the sending buffer, which can be used that the
caller increments a sequence number for the dlm message handle.

For transition process we cast the dlm_mhandle to dlm_msg and vice versa
until the midcomms layer will implement a specific dlm_mhandle structure.
