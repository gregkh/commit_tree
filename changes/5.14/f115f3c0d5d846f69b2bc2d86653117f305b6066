iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Decrease the queue size of evtq and priq

Commit d25f6ead162e ("iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Increase maximum size of queues")
expands the cmdq queue size to improve the success rate of concurrent
command queue space allocation by multiple cores. However, this extension
does not apply to evtq and priq, because for both of them, the SMMU driver
is the consumer. Instead, memory resources are wasted. Therefore, the
queue size of evtq and priq is restored to the original setting, one page.
