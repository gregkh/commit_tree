ceph: reduce contention in ceph_check_delayed_caps()

Function ceph_check_delayed_caps() is called from the mdsc->delayed_work
workqueue and it can be kept looping for quite some time if caps keep
being added back to the mdsc->cap_delay_list.  This may result in the
watchdog tainting the kernel with the softlockup flag.

This patch breaks this loop if the caps have been recently (i.e. during
the loop execution).  Any new caps added to the list will be handled in
the next run.

Also, allow schedule_delayed() callers to explicitly set the delay value
instead of defaulting to 5s, so we can ensure that it runs soon
afterward if it looks like there is more work.
