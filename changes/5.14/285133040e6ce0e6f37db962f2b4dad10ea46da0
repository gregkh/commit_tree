arm64: Import latest memcpy()/memmove() implementation

Import the latest implementation of memcpy(), based on the
upstream code of string/aarch64/memcpy.S at commit afd6244 from
https://github.com/ARM-software/optimized-routines, and subsuming
memmove() in the process.

Note that for simplicity Arm have chosen to contribute this code
to Linux under GPLv2 rather than the original MIT license.

Note also that the needs of the usercopy routines vs. regular memcpy()
have now diverged so far that we abandon the shared template idea
and the damage which that incurred to the tuning of LDP/STP loops.
We'll be back to tackle those routines separately in future.
