net: usb: asix: ax88772: move embedded PHY detection as early as possible

Some HW revisions need additional MAC configuration before the embedded PHY
can be enabled. If this is not done, we won't be able to get response
from the internal PHY.

This issue was detected on chipcode == AX_AX88772_CHIPCODE variant,
where ax88772_hw_reset() was executed with missing embd_phy flag.
