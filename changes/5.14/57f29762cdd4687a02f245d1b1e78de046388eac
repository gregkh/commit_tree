mm: vmscan: fix missing psi annotation for node_reclaim()

In a debugging session the other day, Rik noticed that node_reclaim()
was missing memstall annotations.  This means we'll miss pressure and
lost productivity resulting from reclaim on an overloaded local NUMA
node when vm.zone_reclaim_mode is enabled.

There haven't been any reports, but that's likely because
vm.zone_reclaim_mode hasn't been a commonly used feature recently, and
the intersection between such setups and psi users is probably nil.

But secondary memory such as CXL-connected DIMMS, persistent memory etc,
and the page demotion patches that handle them
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210401183216.443C4443@viggo.jf.intel.com/)
could soon make this a more common codepath again.
