net: dsa: hellcreek: Adjust schedule look ahead window

Traffic schedules can only be started up to eight seconds within the
future. Therefore, the driver periodically checks every two seconds whether the
admin base time provided by the user is inside that window. If so the schedule
is started. Otherwise the check is deferred.

However, according to the programming manual the look ahead window size should
be four - not eight - seconds. By using the proposed value of four seconds
starting a schedule at a specified admin base time actually works as expected.
