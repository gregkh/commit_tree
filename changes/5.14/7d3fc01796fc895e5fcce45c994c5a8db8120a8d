cifs: create sd context must be a multiple of 8

We used to follow the rule earlier that the create SD context
always be a multiple of 8. However, with the change:
cifs: refactor create_sd_buf() and and avoid corrupting the buffer
...we recompute the length, and we failed that rule.
Fixing that with this change.
