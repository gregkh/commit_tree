RDMA/rxe: Fix memory leak in error path code

In rxe_mr_init_user() at the third error the driver fails to free the
memory at mr->map. This patch adds code to do that.  This error only
occurs if page_address() fails to return a non zero address which should
never happen for 64 bit architectures.

Fixes: 8700e3e7c485 ("Soft RoCE driver")
