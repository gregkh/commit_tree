cxl/pci: Introduce cxl_decode_register_block()

Each register block located in the DVSEC needs to be decoded from 2
words, 'register offset high' and 'register offset low'.

Create a function, cxl_decode_register_block() to perform this decode
and return the bar, offset, and register type of the register block.

Then use the values decoded in cxl_mem_map_regblock() instead of passing
the raw registers.
