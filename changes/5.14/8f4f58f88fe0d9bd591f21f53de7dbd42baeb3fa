net: dsa: microchip: ksz8795: Reject unsupported VLAN configuration

The switches supported by ksz8795 only have a per-port flag for Tag
Removal.  This means it is not possible to support both tagged and
untagged VLANs on the same port.  Reject attempts to add a VLAN that
requires the flag to be changed, unless there are no VLANs currently
configured.

VID 0 is excluded from this check since it is untagged regardless of
the state of the flag.

On the CPU port we could support tagged and untagged VLANs at the same
time.  This will be enabled by a later patch.
