clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: Remove unused [RM]MSTPCR() definitions

The Realtime Module Stop Control Register definitions (RMSTPCR(i)) are
incorrect for i >= 8 on R-Car Gen2 and Gen3.

As these are unused, and not planned to be used, just like the
corresponding Modem Module Stop Control Register definitions (MMSTPCR())
on R-Mobile APE6 (they are intended for the software running on the
Real-Time and Modem CPU cores), they can just be removed.
