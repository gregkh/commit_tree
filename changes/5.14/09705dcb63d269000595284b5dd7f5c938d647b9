devres: Enable trace events

In some cases the printf() mechanism is too heavy and can't be used.
For example, when debugging a race condition involving devres API.
When CONFIG_DEBUG_DEVRES is enabled I can't reproduce an issue, and
otherwise it's quite visible with a useful information being collected.

Enable trace events for devres part of the driver core.
