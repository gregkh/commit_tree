ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Add mute support

For each analogue output, in addition to the output volume (gain)
control, the hardware also has a mute control. Add ALSA mute controls
for each analogue output.

If the device has the line_out_hw_vol feature, then the mute control
is disabled along with the output volume control when the switch is
set to HW.
