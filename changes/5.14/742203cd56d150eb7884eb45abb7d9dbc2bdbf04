drm: rockchip: add missing registers for RK3066

Add dither_up, dsp_lut_en and data_blank registers to enable their
respective functionality for RK3066's VOP.

While at that also fix .rb_swap and .format registers for all windows,
which have to be set though RK3066_SYS_CTRL1 register.
Also remove .scl from win1: Scaling is only supported on the primary
plane.
