MIPS: Fix PKMAP with 32-bit MIPS huge page support

When 32-bit MIPS huge page support is enabled, we halve the number of
pointers a PTE page holds, making its last half go to waste.
Correspondingly, we should halve the number of kmap entries, as we just
initialized only a single pte table for that in pagetable_init().
