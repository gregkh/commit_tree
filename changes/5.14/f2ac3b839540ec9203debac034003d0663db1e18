ALSA: firewire-motu: sequence replay for source packet header

This commit takes ALSA firewire-motu driver to perform sequence replay for
media clock recovery.

Unlike the other types of device, the devices in MOTU FireWire series
require two levels of sequence replay; the sequence of the number of
data blocks per packet and the sequence of source packet header per data
block. The former is already cached by ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 packet streaming
engine and ready to be replayed. The latter is also cached by ALSA
firewire-motu driver itself with a previous patch. This commit takes
the driver to replay both of them from the caches.

The sequence replay is tested with below models:

 * 828 mkII
 * Traveler
 * UltraLite
 * 828 mk3 FireWire
 * 828 mk3 Hybrid (except for high sampling transfer frequency
 * UltraLite mk3 FireWire
 * 4pre
 * AudioExpress

Unfortunately, below models still don't generate better sound, requires
more work:

 * 8pre
 * 828 mk3 Hybrid at high sampling transfer frequency

As long as I know, MOTU protocol version 1 requires extra care of the
format of data block, thus below models are not supported yet in this
time:

 * 828
 * 896
