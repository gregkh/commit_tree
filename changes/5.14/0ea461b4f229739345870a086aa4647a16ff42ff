regulator: bd71815: Get rid of struct bd71815_pmic

The content of bd71815_regulators is never changed, no need to duplicate
it, thus remove descs[BD71815_REGULATOR_CNT].
The *regmap, *dev and *rdev[BD71815_REGULATOR_CNT] are not really needed.
The *gps is unused.

Thus the struct bd71815_pmic can be removed.
