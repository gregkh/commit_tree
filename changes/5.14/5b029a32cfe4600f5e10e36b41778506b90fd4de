bpf: Fix ringbuf helper function compatibility

Commit 457f44363a88 ("bpf: Implement BPF ring buffer and verifier support
for it") extended check_map_func_compatibility() by enforcing map -> helper
function match, but not helper -> map type match.

Due to this all of the bpf_ringbuf_*() helper functions could be used with
a wrong map type such as array or hash map, leading to invalid access due
to type confusion.

Also, both BPF_FUNC_ringbuf_{submit,discard} have ARG_PTR_TO_ALLOC_MEM as
argument and not a BPF map. Therefore, their check_map_func_compatibility()
presence is incorrect since it's only for map type checking.
