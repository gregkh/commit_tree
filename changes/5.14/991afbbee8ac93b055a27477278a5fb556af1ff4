KVM: SVM: #SMI interception must not skip the instruction

Commit 5ff3a351f687 ("KVM: x86: Move trivial instruction-based
exit handlers to common code"), unfortunately made a mistake of
treating nop_on_interception and nop_interception in the same way.

Former does truly nothing while the latter skips the instruction.

SMI VM exit handler should do nothing.
(SMI itself is handled by the host when we do STGI)
