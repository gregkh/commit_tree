mmc: core: Read performance enhancements registers for SD cards

In SD spec v6.x the SD function extension registers for performance
enhancements were introduced. These registers let the SD card announce
supports for various performance related features, like "self-maintenance",
"cache" and "command queuing".

Let's extend the parsing of SD function extension registers and store the
information in the struct mmc_card. This prepares for subsequent changes to
implement the complete support for new the performance enhancement
features.
