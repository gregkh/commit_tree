genirq/msi: Ensure deactivation on teardown

msi_domain_alloc_irqs() invokes irq_domain_activate_irq(), but
msi_domain_free_irqs() does not enforce deactivation before tearing down
the interrupts.

This happens when PCI/MSI interrupts are set up and never used before being
torn down again, e.g. in error handling pathes. The only place which cleans
that up is the error handling path in msi_domain_alloc_irqs().

Move the cleanup from msi_domain_alloc_irqs() into msi_domain_free_irqs()
to cure that.
