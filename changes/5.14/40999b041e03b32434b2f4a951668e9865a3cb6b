powerpc/pseries: minor enhancements in dlpar_memory_remove_by_ic()

We don't need the 'lmbs_available' variable to count the valid LMBs and
to check if we have less than 'lmbs_to_remove'. We must ensure that the
entire LMB range must be removed, so we can error out immediately if any
LMB in the range is marked as reserved.

Add a couple of comments explaining the reasoning behind the differences
we have in this function in contrast to what it is done in its sister
function, dlpar_memory_remove_by_count().
