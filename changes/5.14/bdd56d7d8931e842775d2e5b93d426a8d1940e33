ACPI: sysfs: Make sparse happy about address space in use

Sparse is not happy about address space in use in acpi_data_show():

drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:428:14: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:428:14:    expected void [noderef] __iomem *base
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:428:14:    got void *
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:431:59: warning: incorrect type in argument 4 (different address spaces)
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:431:59:    expected void const *from
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:431:59:    got void [noderef] __iomem *base
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:433:30: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:433:30:    expected void *logical_address
drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:433:30:    got void [noderef] __iomem *base

Indeed, acpi_os_map_memory() returns a void pointer with dropped specific
address space. Hence, we don't need to carry out __iomem in acpi_data_show().
