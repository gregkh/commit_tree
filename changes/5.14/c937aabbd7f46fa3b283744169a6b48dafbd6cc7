fs: dlm: always run complete for possible waiters

This patch changes the ping_members() result that we always run
complete() for possible waiters. We handle the -EINTR error code as
successful. This error code is returned if the recovery is stopped which
is likely that a new recovery is triggered with a new members
configuration and ping_members() runs again.
