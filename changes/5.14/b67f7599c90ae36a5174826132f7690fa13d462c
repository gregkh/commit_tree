ChromeOS EC ANX7688 is a display bridge that converts HDMI 2.0 to
DisplayPort 1.3 Ultra-HDi (4096x2160p60). It is an Analogix ANX7688 chip
which is connected to and operated by the ChromeOS Embedded Controller
(See google,cros-ec.yaml). It is accessed using I2C tunneling through
the EC and therefore its node should be a child of an EC I2C tunnel node
(See google,cros-ec-i2c-tunnel.yaml).

ChromOS EC ANX7688 is found on Acer Chromebook R13 (elm)
