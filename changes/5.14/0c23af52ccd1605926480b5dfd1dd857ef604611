RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix stats counters

Statistical counters are not incrementing in some adapter versions with
newer FW. This is due to the stats context length mismatch between FW and
driver. Since the L2 driver updates the length correctly, use the stats
length from L2 driver while allocating the DMA'able memory and creating
the stats context.

Fixes: 9d6b648c3112 ("bnxt_en: Update firmware interface spec to 1.10.1.65.")
