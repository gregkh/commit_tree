drm/i915/display/dg1: Correctly map DPLLs during state readout

_DG1_DPCLKA0_CFGCR0 maps between DPLL 0 and 1 with one bit for phy A
and B while _DG1_DPCLKA1_CFGCR0 maps between DPLL 2 and 3 with one
bit for phy C and D.

Reusing _cnl_ddi_get_pll() don't take that into cosideration returing
DPLL 0 and 1 for phy C and D.

That is a regression introduced in the refactor done in
commit 351221ffc5e5 ("drm/i915: Move DDI clock readout to
encoder->get_config()").
While at it also dropping the macros previously used, not reusing it
to improve readability.
