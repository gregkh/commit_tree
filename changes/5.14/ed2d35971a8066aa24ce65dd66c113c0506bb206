net: bridge: mcast: split router port del+notify for mcast router split

In preparation for the upcoming split of multicast router state into
their IPv4 and IPv6 variants split router port deletion and notification
into two functions. When we disable a port for instance later we want to
only send one notification to switchdev and netlink for compatibility
and want to avoid sending one for IPv4 and one for IPv6. For that the
split is needed.
