net: hns3: minor refactor related to desc_cb handling

desc_cb is used to store mapping and freeing info for the
corresponding desc, which is used in the cleaning process.
There will be more desc_cb type coming up when supporting the
tx bounce buffer, change desc_cb type to bit-wise value in order
to reduce the desc_cb type checking operation in the data path.

Also move the desc_cb type definition to hns3_enet.h because it
is only used in hns3_enet.c, and declare a local variable desc_cb
in hns3_clear_desc() to reduce lines of code.
