bitmap_parse: Support 'all' semantics

RCU code supports an 'all' group as a special case when parsing rcu_nocbs
parameter. This patch moves the 'all' support to the core bitmap_parse
code, so that all bitmap users can enjoy this extension.

Moving 'all' parsing to a bitmap_parse level also allows users to pass
patterns together with 'all' in regular group:pattern format, for example,
"rcu_nocbs=all:1/2" would offload all the even-numbered CPUs regardless
of the number of CPUs on the system.
