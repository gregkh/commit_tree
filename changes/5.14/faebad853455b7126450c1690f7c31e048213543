net: hns3: fix different snprintf() limit

This patch doesn't affect runtime at all, it's just a correctness issue.

The ptp->info.name[] buffer has 16 characters but the snprintf() limit
was capped at 32 characters.  Fortunately, HCLGE_DRIVER_NAME is "hclge"
which isn't close to 16 characters so we're fine.
