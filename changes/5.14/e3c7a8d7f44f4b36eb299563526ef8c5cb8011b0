s390: move restart of execve() syscall

On s390, execve might have to be restarted for PGSTE binaries
like kvm. In the past this was done via the PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART
bit. However, with the recent changes, syscalls are now restarted
differently. Now that execve() is the only call that might get
restarted via PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART, move the loop to do_syscall().
This also has the advantage that the restart is no longer visible
to userspace.
