drm/amdkfd: set memory limit to avoid OOM with HMM enabled

HMM migration alloc sizeof(struct page) on system memory for each VRAM
page, it is 1GB system memory reserved for 64GB VRAM. To avoid
application OOM, increase system memory used size based on VRAM size of
all GPUs, then application alloc memory will fail if system memory usage
reach the limit.
