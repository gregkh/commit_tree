firmware: arm_ffa: Add initial FFA bus support for device enumeration

The Arm FF for Armv8-A specification has concept of endpoints or
partitions. In the Normal world, a partition could be a VM when
the Virtualization extension is enabled or the kernel itself.

In order to handle multiple partitions, we can create a FFA device for
each such partition on a dedicated FFA bus. Similarly, different drivers
requiring FFA transport can be registered on the same bus. We can match
the device and drivers using UUID. This is mostly for the in-kernel
users with FFA drivers.
