drm/bridge: anx7625: Synchronously run runtime suspend.

Originally when using pm_runtime_put, there's a chance that the runtime
suspend hook will be run after the following anx7625_bridge_mode_set
call, resulting in the display_timing_valid field to be cleared, and the
following power on fail.

Change all pm_runtime_put to pm_runtime_put_sync, so all power off
operations are guaranteed to be done after the call returns.
