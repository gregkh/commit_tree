iio: adc: ti-ads7950: Ensure CS is deasserted after reading channels

The ADS7950 requires that CS is deasserted after each SPI word. Before
commit e2540da86ef8 ("iio: adc: ti-ads7950: use SPI_CS_WORD to reduce
CPU usage") the driver used a message with one spi transfer per channel
where each but the last one had .cs_change set to enforce a CS toggle.
This was wrongly translated into a message with a single transfer and
.cs_change set which results in a CS toggle after each word but the
last which corrupts the first adc conversion of all readouts after the
first readout.
