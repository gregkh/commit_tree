driver core: Drop helper devm_platform_ioremap_resource_wc()

Since the macro was introduced in 2019 (commit bb6243b4f73d ("drivers:
platform: provide devm_platform_ioremap_resource_wc()") there is only a
single user which hardly justifies the function for the small task it
provides.

So drop the helper and open-code it in the only user. Adapt the non-wc
case accordingly.

For a all-mod-config build on amd64 this change introduces the following
changes according to bloat-o-meter:

add/remove: 0/1 grow/shrink: 1/0 up/down: 20/-252 (-232)
Function                                     old     new   delta
devm_platform_ioremap_resource_wc            252       -    -252
sram_probe                                   796     816     +20
