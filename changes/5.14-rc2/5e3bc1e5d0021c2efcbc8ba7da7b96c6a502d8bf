net: ipa: introduce ipa_mem_find()

Introduce a new function that abstracts finding information about a
region in IPA-local memory, given its memory region ID.  For now it
simply uses the region ID as an index into the IPA memory array.
If the region is not defined, ipa_mem_find() returns a null pointer.

Update all code that accesses the ipa->mem[] array directly to use
ipa_mem_find() instead.  The return value must be checked for null
when optional memory regions are sought.
