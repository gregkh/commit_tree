x86/fpu/signal: Handle #PF in the direct restore path

If *RSTOR raises an exception, then the slow path is taken. That's wrong
because if the reason was not #PF then going through the slow path is waste
of time because that will end up with the same conclusion that the data is
invalid.

Now that the wrapper around *RSTOR return an negative error code, which is
the negated trap number, it's possible to differentiate.

If the *RSTOR raised #PF then handle it directly in the fast path and if it
was some other exception, e.g. #GP, then give up and do not try the fast
path.

This removes the legacy frame FRSTOR code from the slow path because FRSTOR
is not a ia32_fxstate frame and is therefore handled in the fast path.
