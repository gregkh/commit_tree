arm64: entry: organise entry vectors consistently

In subsequent patches we'll rename the entry handlers based on their
original EL, register width, and exception class. To do so, we need to
make all 3 mandatory arguments to the `kernel_ventry` macro, and
distinguish EL1h from EL1t.

In preparation for this, let's make the current set of arguments
mandatory, and move the `regsize` column before the branch label suffix,
making the vectors easier to read column-wise.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
