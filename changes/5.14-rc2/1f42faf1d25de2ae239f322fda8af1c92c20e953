arm64: __clean_dcache_area_poc to take end parameter instead of size

To be consistent with other functions with similar names and
functionality in cacheflush.h, cache.S, and cachetlb.rst, change
to specify the range in terms of start and end, as opposed to
start and size.

Because the code is shared with __dma_clean_area, it changes the
parameters for that as well. However, __dma_clean_area is local to
cache.S, so no other users are affected.

No functional change intended.
