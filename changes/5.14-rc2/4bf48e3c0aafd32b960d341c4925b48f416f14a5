KVM: x86: Use guest MAXPHYADDR from CPUID.0x8000_0008 iff TDP is enabled

Ignore the guest MAXPHYADDR reported by CPUID.0x8000_0008 if TDP, i.e.
NPT, is disabled, and instead use the host's MAXPHYADDR.  Per AMD'S APM:

  Maximum guest physical address size in bits. This number applies only
  to guests using nested paging. When this field is zero, refer to the
  PhysAddrSize field for the maximum guest physical address size.
