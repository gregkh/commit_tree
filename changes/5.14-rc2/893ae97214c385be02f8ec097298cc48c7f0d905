octeontx2-af: cn10k: Support configurable LMTST regions

This patch extends the lmtst_tbl_setup_req mbox to support run time
LMTST configuration.
RVU PF/VF and DPDK/ODP allocates a LMT region, creates a translation
entry for a device via VFIO IOCTLs.
This IOVA is shared with AF through above mbox. AF then uses
RVU_SMMU transulation Widget and gets PA for the IOVA and updates
the LMTtable entry for that device.
