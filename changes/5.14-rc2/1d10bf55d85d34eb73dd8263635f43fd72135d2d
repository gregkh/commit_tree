rcu-tasks: Don't delete holdouts within trc_inspect_reader()

As Yanfei pointed out, although invoking trc_del_holdout() is safe
from the viewpoint of the integrity of the holdout list itself,
the put_task_struct() invoked by trc_del_holdout() can result in
use-after-free errors due to later accesses to this task_struct structure
by the RCU Tasks Trace grace-period kthread.

This commit therefore removes this call to trc_del_holdout() from
trc_inspect_reader() in favor of the grace-period thread's existing call
to trc_del_holdout(), thus eliminating that particular class of
use-after-free errors.
