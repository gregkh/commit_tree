net: qualcomm: rmnet: eliminate some ifdefs

If IPV6 is not enabled in the kernel configuration, the RMNet
checksum code indicates a buffer containing an IPv6 packet is not
supported.  The same thing happens if a buffer contains something
other than an IPv4 or IPv6 packet.

We can rearrange things a bit in two functions so that some #ifdef
calls can simply be eliminated.
