dt-bindings: power: supply: charger-manager: Convert to DT schema format

Convert the binding to DT schema format.

I slightly modified the binding by allowing regulator-[0-9] and cable-[0-9]
instead of regulator@[0-9] and cable@[0-9], so that DT compiler does not
complain about missing 'reg' property. The driver actually ignores the
nodename and can handle both styles.
