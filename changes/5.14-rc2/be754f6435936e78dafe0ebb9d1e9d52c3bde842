net: qualcomm: rmnet: trailer value is a checksum

The csum_value field in the rmnet_map_dl_csum_trailer structure is a
"real" Internet checksum.  It is a 16 bit value, in big endian format,
which represents an inverted ones' complement sum over pairs of bytes.

Make that clear by changing its type to __sum16.

This makes a typecast in rmnet_map_ipv4_dl_csum_trailer() and
another in rmnet_map_ipv6_dl_csum_trailer() unnecessary.
