usb: cdnsp: Useless condition has been removed

This code generates a Smatch warning:

drivers/usb/cdns3/cdnsp-mem.c:1085 cdnsp_mem_cleanup()
warn: variable dereferenced before check 'pdev->dcbaa' (see line 1067)

The unchecked dereference happens inside the function when we call:

cdnsp_free_priv_device(pdev);

But fortunately, the "pdev->dcbaa" pointer can never be NULL so it
does not lead to a runtime issue. We can just remove the NULL check
which silences the warning and makes the code consistent.
