Revert "arm64: cache: Lower ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to 64 (L1_CACHE_BYTES)"

This reverts commit 65688d2a05deb9f0671a7e2301eadbfe7e27c9e9.

Unfortunately, the original Qualcomm Kryo cores integrated into the
MSM8996 SoC feature an L2 cache with 128-byte lines which sits above
the Point of Coherency. Consequently, we must restore ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN
to its former ugly self so that non-coherent DMA can be performed safely
on devices built using this SoC.

Thanks to Jeffrey Hugo for confirming this with a hardware designer.
