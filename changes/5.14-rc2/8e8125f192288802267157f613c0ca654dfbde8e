habanalabs: add debug flag to prevent failure on timeout

Sometimes it is useful to allow the command to continue running despite
the timeout occurred, to differentiate between really stuck or just very
time consuming commands. This can be achieved by passing a new debug
flag alongside the cs, HL_CS_FLAGS_SKIP_RESET_ON_TIMEOUT.

Anyway, if the timeout occurred, a warning print shall be issued,
however this shall not fail the submission.
