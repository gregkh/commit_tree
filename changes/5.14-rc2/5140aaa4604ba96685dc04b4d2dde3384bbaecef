s390: iucv: Avoid field over-reading memcpy()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally reading across neighboring array fields.

Add a wrapping struct to serve as the memcpy() source so the compiler
can perform appropriate bounds checking, avoiding this future warning:

In function '__fortify_memcpy',
    inlined from 'iucv_message_pending' at net/iucv/iucv.c:1663:4:
./include/linux/fortify-string.h:246:4: error: call to '__read_overflow2_field' declared with attribute error: detected read beyond size of field (2nd parameter)
