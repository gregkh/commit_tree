locking/atomic: net: use linux/atomic.h for xchg & cmpxchg

As xchg*() and cmpxchg*() may be instrumented by atomic-instrumented.h,
it's necessary to include <linux/atomic.h> to use these, rather than
<asm/cmpxchg.h>, which is effectively an arch-internal header.

In a couple of places we include <asm/cmpxchg.h>, but get away with this
as <linux/atomic.h> gets pulled in inidrectly by another include. Before
we convert more architectures to use atomic-instrumented.h, let's fix
these up to use <linux/atomic.h> so that we don't make things more
fragile.
