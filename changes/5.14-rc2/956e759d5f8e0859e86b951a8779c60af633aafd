i40e: Fix missing rtnl locking when setting up pf switch

A recent change that made i40e use new udp_tunnel infrastructure
uses a method that expects to be called under rtnl lock.

However, not all codepaths do the lock prior to calling
i40e_setup_pf_switch.

Fix that by adding additional rtnl locking and unlocking.
