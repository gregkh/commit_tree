staging: rtl8188eu: remove _dbg_dump_tx_info function

Remove the _dbg_dump_tx_info function from hal/rtl8188e_xmit.c, as
it doesn't actually do anything and is only called from one place.
It used to have some redundant debugging statements in it, but these
have now been removed anyway, so all it does is read information from
the adapter to set a variable 'dump_txdesc' which is then never used.
This fixes a kernel test robot warning.
