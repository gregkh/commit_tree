net: bridge: multicast: fix PIM hello router port marking race

When a PIM hello packet is received on a bridge port with multicast
snooping enabled, we mark it as a router port automatically, that
includes adding that port the router port list. The multicast lock
protects that list, but it is not acquired in the PIM message case
leading to a race condition, we need to take it to fix the race.
