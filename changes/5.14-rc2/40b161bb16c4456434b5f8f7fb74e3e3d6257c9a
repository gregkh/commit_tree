net: pch_gbe: remove unneeded MODULE_VERSION() call

Remove MODULE_VERSION(), as it doesn't seem to serve any practical purpose.
For in-tree drivers, the kernel version matters. The code received lots of
changes, but module version remained constant, since the driver landed in
mainline. So, this version doesn't seem have any practical meaning anymore.
