drm/amdgpu: Fix RAS function interface

The correctable and uncorrectable errors
are calculated at each invocation of this
function. Therefore, it is highly inefficient to
return just one of them based on a Boolean
input. If the caller wants both, twice the work
would be done. (And this work is O(n^3) on
Vega20.)

Fix this "interface" to simply return what it had
calculated--both values. Let the caller choose
what it wants to record, inspect, use.
