ice: process 1588 PTP capabilities during initialization

The device firmware reports PTP clock capabilities to each PF during
initialization. This includes various information for both the overall
device and the individual function, including

For functions:
* whether this function has timesync enabled
* whether this function owns one of the 2 possible clock timers, and
  which one
* which timer the function is associated with
* the clock frequency, if the device supports multiple clock frequencies
* The GPIO pin association for the timer owned by this PF, if any

For the device:
* Which PF owns timer 0, if any
* Which PF owns timer 1, if any
* whether timer 0 is enabled
* whether timer 1 is enabled

Extract the bits from the capabilities information reported by firmware
and store them in the device and function capability structures.o

This information will be used in a future change to have the function
driver enable PTP hardware clock support.
