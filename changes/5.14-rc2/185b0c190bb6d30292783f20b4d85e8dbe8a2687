selftests: forwarding: Add test for custom multipath hash with IPv4 GRE

Test that when the hash policy is set to custom, traffic is distributed
only according to the inner fields set in the fib_multipath_hash_fields
sysctl.

Each time set a different field and make sure traffic is only
distributed when the field is changed in the packet stream.

The test only verifies the behavior of IPv4/IPv6 overlays on top of an
IPv4 underlay network. A subsequent patch will do the same with an IPv6
underlay network.

Example output:

 # ./gre_custom_multipath_hash.sh
