btrfs: zoned: fix types for u64 division in btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work

The types in calculation of the used percentage in the reclaiming
messages are both u64, though bg->length is either 1GiB (non-zoned) or
the zone size in the zoned mode. The upper limit on zone size is 8GiB so
this could theoretically overflow in the future, right now the values
fit.
