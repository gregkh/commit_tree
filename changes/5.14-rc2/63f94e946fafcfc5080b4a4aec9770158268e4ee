cifs: fix missing null session check in mount

Although it is unlikely to be have ended up with a null
session pointer calling cifs_try_adding_channels in cifs_mount.
Coverity correctly notes that we are already checking for
it earlier (when we return from do_dfs_failover), so at
a minimum to clarify the code we should make sure we also
check for it when we exit the loop so we don't end up calling
cifs_try_adding_channels or mount_setup_tlink with a null
ses pointer.
