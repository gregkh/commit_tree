net: bridge: multicast: fix MRD advertisement router port marking race

When an MRD advertisement is received on a bridge port with multicast
snooping enabled, we mark it as a router port automatically, that
includes adding that port to the router port list. The multicast lock
protects that list, but it is not acquired in the MRD advertisement case
leading to a race condition, we need to take it to fix the race.
