tcp: consistently disable header prediction for mptcp

The MPTCP receive path is hooked only into the TCP slow-path.
The DSS presence allows plain MPTCP traffic to hit that
consistently.

Since commit e1ff9e82e2ea ("net: mptcp: improve fallback to TCP"),
when an MPTCP socket falls back to TCP, it can hit the TCP receive
fast-path, and delay or stop triggering the event notification.

Address the issue explicitly disabling the header prediction
for MPTCP sockets.
