KVM: nVMX: Reset eVMCS clean fields data from prepare_vmcs02()

When nested state migration happens during L1's execution, it
is incorrect to modify eVMCS as it is L1 who 'owns' it at the moment.
At least genuine Hyper-V seems to not be very happy when 'clean fields'
data changes underneath it.

'Clean fields' data is used in KVM twice: by copy_enlightened_to_vmcs12()
and prepare_vmcs02_rare() so we can reset it from prepare_vmcs02() instead.

While at it, update a comment stating why exactly we need to reset
'hv_clean_fields' data from L0.
