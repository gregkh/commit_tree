arm64: defconfig: Do not override the MTK_PMIC_WRAP symbol

Commit 'fbbe38309d56 ("arm64: defconfig: Allow mt8173-based boards to boot
from usb")' added the MTK_PMIC_WRAP config built-in. It needs to be
built-in in order to be able to boot from USB or the MMC without needing
a ramdisk, but that symbol was already defined as a module so now we are
getting the following warning:

  arch/arm64/configs/defconfig:996:warning: override: reassigning to symbol MTK_PMIC_WRAP

Remove the MTK_PMIC_WRAP=m from the defconfig to remove the error.
