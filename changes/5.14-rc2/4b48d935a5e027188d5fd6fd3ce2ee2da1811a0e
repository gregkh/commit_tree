Input: cyttsp - convert bindings to YAML and extend

This converts the CYTTSP "Cypress TrueTouch Standard Product"
to YAML bindings and fixes and adds some things in the process:

- Rename the bindings file to cypress,cy8ctma340 after the main
  product in the series.
- Add proper compatibles for the two known products:
  CY8CTMA340 and CY8CTST341.
- Deprecate "cypress,cyttsp-spi" and "cypress,cyttsp-i2c"
  because device compatibles should be named after the
  hardware and not after which bus they are connected to.
  The topology implicitly tells us which bus it is and what
  interface to used.
- Add VCPIN and VDD supplies, these are present just like
  on the CY8CTMA140.
