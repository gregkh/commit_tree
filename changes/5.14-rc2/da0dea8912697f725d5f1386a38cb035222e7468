pwm: spear: Free resources only after pwmchip_remove()

Before pwmchip_remove() returns the PWM is expected to be functional. So
remove the pwmchip before disabling the clocks. The check for
pwmchip_remove()'s return value is dropped as this function returns
effectively always 0 and returning an error in a remove callback is
useless anyhow (as the device core ignores it and drops devm allocated
resources).
