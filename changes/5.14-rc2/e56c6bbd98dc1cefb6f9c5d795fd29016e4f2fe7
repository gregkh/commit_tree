net: ocelot: fix switchdev objects synced for wrong netdev with LAG offload

The point with a *dev and a *brport_dev is that when we have a LAG net
device that is a bridge port, *dev is an ocelot net device and
*brport_dev is the bonding/team net device. The ocelot net device
beneath the LAG does not exist from the bridge's perspective, so we need
to sync the switchdev objects belonging to the brport_dev and not to the
dev.
