gve: DQO: Remove incorrect prefetch

The prefetch is incorrectly using the dma address instead of the virtual
address.

It's supposed to be:
prefetch((char *)buf_state->page_info.page_address +
	 buf_state->page_info.page_offset)

However, after correcting this mistake, there is no evidence of
performance improvement.
