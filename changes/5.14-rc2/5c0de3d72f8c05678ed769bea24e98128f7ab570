dm writecache: make writeback pause configurable

Commit 95b88f4d71cb953e02206be3c757083601391a0f ("dm writecache: pause
writeback if cache full and origin being written directly") introduced a
code that pauses cache flushing if we are issuing writes directly to the
origin.

Improve that initial commit by making the timeout code configurable
(via the option "pause_writeback"). Also change the default from 1s to
3s because it performed better.
