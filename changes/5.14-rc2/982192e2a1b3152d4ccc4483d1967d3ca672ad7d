staging: fbtft: Replace custom ->reset() with generic one

The custom ->reset() repeats the generic one, replace it.

Note, in newer kernels the context of the function is a sleeping one,
it's fine to switch over to the sleeping functions. Keeping the reset
line asserted longer than 20 microseconds is also okay, it's an idling
state of the hardware.
