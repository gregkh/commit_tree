pstore/blk: Use the normal block device I/O path

Stop poking into block layer internals and just open the block device
file an use kernel_read and kernel_write on it. Note that this means
the transformation from name_to_dev_t can't be used anymore when
pstore_blk is loaded as a module: a full filesystem device path name
must be used instead. Additionally removes ":internal:" kerndoc link,
since no such documentation remains.
