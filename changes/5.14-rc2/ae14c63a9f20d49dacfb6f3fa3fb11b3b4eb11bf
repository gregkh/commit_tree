Revert "mm/slub: use stackdepot to save stack trace in objects"

This reverts commit 788691464c29455346dc613a3b43c2fb9e5757a4.

It's not clear why, but it causes unexplained problems in entirely
unrelated xfs code.  The most likely explanation is some slab
corruption, possibly triggered due to CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON.  See [1].

It ends up having a few other problems too, like build errors on
arch/arc, and Geert reporting it using much more memory on m68k [3] (it
probably does so elsewhere too, but it is probably just more noticeable
on m68k).

The architecture issues (both build and memory use) are likely just
because this change effectively force-enabled STACKDEPOT (along with a
very bad default value for the stackdepot hash size).  But together with
the xfs issue, this all smells like "this commit was not ready" to me.
