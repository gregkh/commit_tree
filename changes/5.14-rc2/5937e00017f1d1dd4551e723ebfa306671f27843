xfs: Fix multiple fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix
the following warnings by replacing /* fallthrough */ comments,
and its variants, with the new pseudo-keyword macro fallthrough:

fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:487:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:500:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:532:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:594:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:607:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:1410:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:1445:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c:1473:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fallthrough */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings, so in order to globally enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, these comments need to be
replaced with fallthrough; in the whole codebase.
