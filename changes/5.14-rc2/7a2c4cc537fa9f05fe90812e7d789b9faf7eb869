devm-helpers: Add resource managed version of work init

A few drivers which need a work-queue must cancel work at driver detach.
Some of those implement remove() solely for this purpose. Help drivers to
avoid unnecessary remove and error-branch implementation by adding managed
verision of work initialization. This will also help drivers to avoid
mixing manual and devm based unwinding when other resources are handled by
devm.
