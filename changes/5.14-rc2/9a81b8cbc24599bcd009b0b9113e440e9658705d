dt-bindings: reset: Convert ti,sci-reset to json schema

Convert the ti,sci-reset to json schema for better checks and documentation.

Differences being:
 - Drop consumer example as they are documented in the corresponding
   bindings themselves.
 - Drop phandle description for reset consumer or cell definition as it is
   redundant.
