xsk: Fix broken Tx ring validation

Fix broken Tx ring validation for AF_XDP. The commit under the Fixes
tag, fixed an off-by-one error in the validation but introduced
another error. Descriptors are now let through even if they straddle a
chunk boundary which they are not allowed to do in aligned mode. Worse
is that they are let through even if they straddle the end of the umem
itself, tricking the kernel to read data outside the allowed umem
region which might or might not be mapped at all.

Fix this by reintroducing the old code, but subtract the length by one
to fix the off-by-one error that the original patch was
addressing. The test chunk != chunk_end makes sure packets do not
straddle chunk boundraries. Note that packets of zero length are
allowed in the interface, therefore the test if the length is
non-zero.
