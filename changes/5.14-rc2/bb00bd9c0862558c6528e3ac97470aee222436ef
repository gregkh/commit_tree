KVM: nSVM: Restore nested control upon leaving SMM

If the VM was migrated while in SMM, no nested state was saved/restored,
and therefore svm_leave_smm has to load both save and control area
of the vmcb12. Save area is already loaded from HSAVE area,
so now load the control area as well from the vmcb12.
