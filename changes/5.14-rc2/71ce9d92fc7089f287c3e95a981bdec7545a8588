octeontx2-pf: Fix uninitialized boolean variable pps

In the case where act->id is FLOW_ACTION_POLICE and also
act->police.rate_bytes_ps > 0 or act->police.rate_pkt_ps is not > 0
the boolean variable pps contains an uninitialized value when
function otx2_tc_act_set_police is called. Fix this by initializing
pps to false.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable)"
