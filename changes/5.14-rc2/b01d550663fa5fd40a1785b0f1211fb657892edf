spi: Fix self assignment issue with ancillary->mode

There is an assignment of ancillary->mode to itself which looks
dubious since the proceeding comment states that the speed and
mode is taken over from the SPI main device, indicating that
ancillary->mode should assigned using the value spi->mode.
Fix this.
