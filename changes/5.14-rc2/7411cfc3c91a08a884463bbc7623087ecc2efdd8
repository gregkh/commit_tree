ARM: 9070/1: Make UNWINDER_ARM depend on ld.bfd or ld.lld 11.0.0+

When linking aspeed_g5_defconfig with ld.lld 10.0.1, the following error
occurs:

ld.lld: error: .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms1:(.ARM.exidx+0x34D98): relocation
R_ARM_PREL31 out of range: 2135538592 is not in [-1073741824,
1073741823]

This was resolved in ld.lld 11.0.0 but the minimum supported version of
ld.lld for the kernel is 10.0.1. Prevent CONFIG_UNWINDER_ARM from being
selected in this case so that the problematic sections cannot be
created.
