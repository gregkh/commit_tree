net: hns3: refactor dump reset info of debugfs

Currently, the debugfs command for reset info is implemented by
"echo xxxx > cmd", and record the information in dmesg. It's
unnecessary and heavy. To improve it, create a single file
"reset_info" for it, and query it by command "cat reset_info",
return the result to userspace, rather than record in dmesg.

The display style is below:
$cat reset_info
PF reset count: 0
FLR reset count: 0
GLOBAL reset count: 0
IMP reset count: 0
reset done count: 0
HW reset done count: 0
reset count: 0
reset fail count: 0
vector0 interrupt enable status: 0x1
reset interrupt source: 0x0
reset interrupt status: 0x0
RAS interrupt status:0x0
hardware reset status: 0x0
handshake status: 0x80
function reset status: 0x0

Change to the "hclge_show_rst_info" in the "hclge_reset_err_handle",
when the reset fails, display reset info immediately.
