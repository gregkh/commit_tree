ALSA: bebob: correct duplicated entries with TerraTec OUI

ALSA bebob driver has duplicated entries for modalias of
'ieee1394:ven00000AACmo00000002sp0000A02Dver00010001' since entries for
two devices below have the same parameters:

 * Acoustic Reality eAR Master One, Eroica, Figaro, and Ciaccona
 * TerraTec Aureon 7.1 FireWire

I relied on FFADO revision 737 to add the former entry, on the other hand,
the latter is based on message posted by actual user with information of
sysfs node:

 * https://sourceforge.net/p/ffado/mailman/ffado-user/thread/5743F969.2080204%40marcobaldo.ch/

It appears that they have OUI of Terratec Electronic GmbH (0x000aac) and
the same model ID, thus suffice to say that they have something common
in their internals.

Although it's not going to make a big difference, this commit arranges
the entries.
