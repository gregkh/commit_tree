net: bridge: sync fdb to new unicast-filtering ports

Since commit 2796d0c648c9 ("bridge: Automatically manage
port promiscuous mode.")
bridges with `vlan_filtering 1` and only 1 auto-port don't
set IFF_PROMISC for unicast-filtering-capable ports.

Normally on port changes `br_manage_promisc` is called to
update the promisc flags and unicast filters if necessary,
but it cannot distinguish between *new* ports and ones
losing their promisc flag, and new ports end up not
receiving the MAC address list.

Fix this by calling `br_fdb_sync_static` in `br_add_if`
after the port promisc flags are updated and the unicast
filter was supposed to have been filled.
