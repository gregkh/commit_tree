drm/amdkfd: add sysfs counters for vm fault and migration

This is part of SVM profiling API, export sysfs counters for
per-process, per-GPU vm retry fault, pages migrated in and out of GPU vram.

counters will not be updated in parallel in GPU retry fault handler and
migration to vram/ram path, use READ_ONCE to avoid compiler
optimization.
