ALSA: firewire-lib: handle the case that empty isochronous packet payload for CIP

Two quadlets are at least included in isochronous packet payload for
Common Isochronous Packet (CIP) format in IEC 61883-1. However, it's
better to equip ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 packet streaming engine for contrary
packet.

This commit handles isochronous cycle to process such packet so that the
cycle is skipped.
