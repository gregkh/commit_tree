ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Make NOP_USB_XCEIV driver built-in

The usage of usb-nop-xceiv PHY on Raspberry Pi boards with BCM283x has
been a "regression source" a lot of times. The last case is breakage of
USB mass storage boot has been commit e590474768f1 ("driver core: Set
fw_devlink=on by default") for multi_v7_defconfig. As long as
NOP_USB_XCEIV is configured as module, the dwc2 USB driver defer probing
endlessly and prevent booting from USB mass storage device. So make
the driver built-in as in bcm2835_defconfig and arm64/defconfig.

Fixes: e590474768f1 ("driver core: Set fw_devlink=on by default")
