serial: fsl_lpuart: remove manual RTSCTS control from 8-bit LPUART

The LPUART doesn't have the ability to control the RTS or CTS line
manually. Instead it will set it automatically when data is send or
handle it when data is received. Thus drop the wrong code in set_mctrl.
For the 32 bit version this was already done in the commit 2b30efe2e88a
("tty: serial: lpuart: Remove unnecessary code from set_mctrl"). Keep
the 8-bit version in sync and remove it there, too.
