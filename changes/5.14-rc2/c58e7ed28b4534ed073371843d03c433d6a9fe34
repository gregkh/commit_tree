PM: runtime: document common mistake with pm_runtime_get_sync()

pm_runtime_get_sync(), contradictory to intuition, does not drop the
runtime PM usage counter on errors which lead to several wrong usages in
drivers (missing the put).  pm_runtime_resume_and_get() was added as a
better implementation so document the preference of using it, hoping it
will stop bad patterns.
