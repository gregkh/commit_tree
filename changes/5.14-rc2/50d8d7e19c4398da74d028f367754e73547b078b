dt-bindings: display: renesas,du: Make resets optional on R-Car H1

The "resets" property is not present on R-Car Gen1 SoCs.
Supporting it would require migrating from renesas,cpg-clocks to
renesas,cpg-mssr.

Reflect this in the DT bindings by removing the global "required:
resets".  All SoCs that do have "resets" properties already have
SoC-specific rules making it required.
