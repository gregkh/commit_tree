arm64: entry: move NMI preempt logic to C

Currently portions of our preempt logic are written in C while other
parts are written in assembly. Let's clean this up a little bit by
moving the NMI preempt checks to C. For now, the preempt count (and
need_resched) checking is left in assembly, and will be converted
with the body of the IRQ handler in subsequent patches.

Other than the increased lockdep coverage there should be no functional
change as a result of this patch.
