scsi: target: sbp_target: Remove redundant assignment to pg_size

Variable pg_size is set to '0x100 << pg_size', but this value is never read
and it is not used later on. Hence it is a redundant assignment and can be
removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/target/sbp/sbp_target.c:1264:3: warning: Value stored to
'pg_size' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
