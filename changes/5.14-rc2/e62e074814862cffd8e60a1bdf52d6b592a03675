arm64: Add missing header <asm/smp.h> in two files

Add missing header <asm/smp.h> on include/asm/smp_plat.h, as it calls function
cpu_logical_map(). Also include it on kernel/cpufeature.c since it has calls to
functions cpu_panic_kernel() and cpu_die_early().

Both files call functions defined on this header, make the header dependencies
less fragile.
