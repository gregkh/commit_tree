hv_netvsc: Avoid field-overflowing memcpy()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Add flexible array to represent start of buf_info, improving readability
and avoid future warning where memcpy() thinks it is writing past the
end of the structure.
