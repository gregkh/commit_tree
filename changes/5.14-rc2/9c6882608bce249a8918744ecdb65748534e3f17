io_uring: use right task for exiting checks

When we use delayed_work for fallback execution of requests, current
will be not of the submitter task, and so checks in io_req_task_submit()
may not behave as expected. Currently, it leaves inline completions not
flushed, so making io_ring_exit_work() to hang. Use the submitter task
for all those checks.
