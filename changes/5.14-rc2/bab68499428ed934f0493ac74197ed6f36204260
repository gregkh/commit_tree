dm zoned: check zone capacity

The dm-zoned target cannot support zoned block devices with zones that
have a capacity smaller than the zone size (e.g. NVMe zoned namespaces)
due to the current chunk zone mapping implementation as it is assumed
that zones and chunks have the same size with all blocks usable.
If a zoned drive is found to have zones with a capacity different from
the zone size, fail the target initialization.
