firmware: arm_ffa: Fix the comment style

clang produces the following warning:

    drivers/firmware/arm_ffa/driver.c:123: warning: expecting
    prototype for FF(). Prototype was for FFA_PAGE_SIZE() instead

    This comment starts with '/**', but isn't a kernel-doc comment.
    Refer Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst

Fix the same by removing the kernel-doc style comment here.
