ice: Refactor VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES handling

Currently, when a VF requests queue configuration via
VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES the PF driver expects that this message
will only be called once and we always assume the queues being
configured start from 0. This is incorrect and is causing issues when
a VF tries to send this message for multiple queue blocks. Fix this by
using the queue_id specified in the virtchnl message and allowing for
individual Rx and/or Tx queues to be configured.

Also, reduce the duplicated for loops for configuring the queues by
moving all the logic into a single for loop.
