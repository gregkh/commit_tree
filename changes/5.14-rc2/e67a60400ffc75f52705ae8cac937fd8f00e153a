habanalabs: read f/w's 2-nd sts and err registers

Maintain both STS1 and ERR1 registers used for status communication
with F/W.
Those are not maintained as we currently have less than 31
statuses/error defined and so LKD did not refer to those register.
The reason to read them now is to try to support future f/w versions
with current driver.
