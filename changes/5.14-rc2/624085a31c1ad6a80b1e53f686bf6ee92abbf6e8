ipv6: fix out-of-bound access in ip6_parse_tlv()

First problem is that optlen is fetched without checking
there is more than one byte to parse.

Fix this by taking care of IPV6_TLV_PAD1 before
fetching optlen (under appropriate sanity checks against len)

Second problem is that IPV6_TLV_PADN checks of zero
padding are performed before the check of remaining length.

Fixes: c1412fce7ecc ("net/ipv6/exthdrs.c: Strict PadN option checking")
