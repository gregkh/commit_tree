wireless: wext-spy: Fix out-of-bounds warning

Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:

net/wireless/wext-spy.c:178:2: warning: 'memcpy' offset [25, 28] from the object at 'threshold' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'low' with type 'struct iw_quality' at offset 20 [-Warray-bounds]

The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
memcpy(). This causes a legitimate compiler warning because memcpy()
overruns the length of &threshold.low and &spydata->spy_thr_low. As
these are just a couple of struct members, fix this by using direct
assignments, instead of memcpy().

This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().
