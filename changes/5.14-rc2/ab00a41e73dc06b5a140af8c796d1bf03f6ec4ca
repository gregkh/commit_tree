usb: dwc3: trace: Remove unused fields in dwc3_log_trb

Commit 0bd0f6d201eb ("usb: dwc3: gadget: remove allocated/queued request
tracking") removed the allocated & queued fields from struct dwc3_ep
but neglected to also remove them from the dwc3_log_trb event class's
TP_STRUCT definition which are now unused. Remove them to save eight
bytes per trace event entry.
