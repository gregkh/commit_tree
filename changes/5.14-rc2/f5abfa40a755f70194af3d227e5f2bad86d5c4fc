iio: adc: Add missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE

MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is used to extract the device information out of the
driver and builds a table when being compiled. If using this macro,
kernel can find the driver if available when the device is plugged in,
and then loads that driver and initializes the device.
