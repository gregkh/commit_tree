selftests/powerpc: EBB selftest for MMCR0 control for PMU SPRs in ISA v3.1

With the MMCR0 control bit (PMCCEXT) in ISA v3.1, read access to
group B registers is restricted when MMCR0 PMCC=0b00. In other
platforms (like power9), the older behaviour works where group B
PMU SPRs are readable.

Patch creates a selftest which verifies that the test takes a
SIGILL when attempting to read PMU registers via helper function
"dump_ebb_state" for ISA v3.1.
