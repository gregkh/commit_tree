blk-cgroup: prevent rcu_sched detected stalls warnings while iterating blkgs

We run a test that create millions of cgroups and blkgs, and then trigger
blkg_destroy_all(). blkg_destroy_all() will hold spin lock for a long
time in such situation. Thus release the lock when a batch of blkgs are
destroyed.

blkcg_activate_policy() and blkcg_deactivate_policy() might have the
same problem, however, as they are basically only called from module
init/exit paths, let's leave them alone for now.
