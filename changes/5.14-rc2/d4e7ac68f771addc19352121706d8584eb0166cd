ipmi: kcs_bmc: Strip private client data from struct kcs_bmc

Move all client-private data out of `struct kcs_bmc` into the KCS client
implementation.

With this change the KCS BMC core code now only concerns itself with
abstract `struct kcs_bmc` and `struct kcs_bmc_client` types, achieving
expected separation of concerns. Further, the change clears the path for
implementation of alternative userspace interfaces.

The chardev data-structures are rearranged in the same manner applied to
the KCS device driver data-structures in an earlier patch - `struct
kcs_bmc_client` is embedded in the client's private data and we exploit
container_of() to translate as required.

Finally, now that it is free of client data, `struct kcs_bmc` is renamed
to `struct kcs_bmc_device` to contrast `struct kcs_bmc_client`.
