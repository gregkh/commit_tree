x86/entry: Split PUSH_AND_CLEAR_REGS into two submacros

PUSH_AND_CLEAR_REGS, as the name implies, performs two functions:
pushing registers and clearing registers. They don't necessarily have
to be performed in immediate sequence, although all current users
do. Split it into two macros for the case where that isn't desired;
the FRED enabling patchset will eventually make use of this.
