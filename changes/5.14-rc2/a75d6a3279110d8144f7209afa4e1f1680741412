staging: rtl8188eu: remove ASSERT and ODM_RT_ASSERT macros

Remove the ASSERT and ODM_RT_ASSERT macros from include/odm_debug.h
as they are unnecessary.

ASSERT does nothing, compiling to a single empty statement.
ODM_RT_ASSERT is used in only one place, in the ODM_RAStateCheck
function with hal/odm.c - it seems to have been intended as an
assertion of some kind, but given it is always called with false
here, there is little point in it not just being a pr_info() call.

Also, the lines relating to the file, function and line number are
not needed as the pr_info() with the function name and error message
is sufficient should anyone wish to track down this error at a source
level, within what is currently a relatively small function.
