torture: Make kvm-remote.sh account for network failure in pathname checks

In a long-duration kvm-remote.sh run, almost all of the remote accesses will
be simple file-existence checks.  These are thus the most likely to be caught
out by network failures, which do happen from time to time.

This commit therefore takes a first step towards tolerating temporary
network outages by making the file-existence checks repeat in the face of
such an outage.  They also print a message every minute during a outage,
allowing the user to take appropriate action.
