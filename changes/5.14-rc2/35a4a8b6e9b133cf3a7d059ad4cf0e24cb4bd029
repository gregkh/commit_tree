arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Sanitize pins

In order to prepare for feature development, the DTs
have to be workable with.. To achieve that:

- Rename msmgpio to tlmm (consistency with newer DTs)
- Rid msm8996-pins.dtsi and add the contents to msm8996.dtsi
- Modernize the pin nodes, make them more concise
- Add generic pin configuration for some hardware
- Fix up some names in preparation for BLSP/UART name cleaning..
