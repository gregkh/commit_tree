libbpf: Reject static maps

Static maps never really worked with libbpf, because all such maps were always
silently resolved to the very first map. Detect static maps (both legacy and
BTF-defined) and report user-friendly error.

Tested locally by switching few maps (legacy and BTF-defined) in selftests to
static ones and verifying that now libbpf rejects them loudly.
