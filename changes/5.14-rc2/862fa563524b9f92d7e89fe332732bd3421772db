powerpc/64: interrupt soft-enable race fix

Prevent interrupt restore from allowing racing hard interrupts going
ahead of previous soft-pending ones, by using the soft-masked restart
handler to allow a store to clear the soft-mask while knowing nothing
is soft-pending.

This probably doesn't matter much in practice, but it's a simple
demonstrator / test case to exercise the restart table logic.
