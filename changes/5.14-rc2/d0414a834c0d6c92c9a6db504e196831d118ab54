drm/amd/display: Extend AUX timeout for DP initial reads

[WHY]
DP LL Compliance tests require that the first DPCD transactions after a
hotplug have a timeout interval of 3.2 ms.  In cases where LTTPR is
disabled, this means that the first reads from DP_SET_POWER and DP_DPCD_REV must have an extended
timeout.
