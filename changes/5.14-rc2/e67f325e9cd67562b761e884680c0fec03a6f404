net: stmmac: explicitly deassert GMAC_AHB_RESET

We are currently assuming that GMAC_AHB_RESET will already be deasserted
by the bootloader. However if this has not been done, probing of the GMAC
will fail. To remedy this we must ensure GMAC_AHB_RESET has been deasserted
prior to probing.

v2 changes:
 - remove NULL condition check for stmmac_ahb_rst in stmmac_main.c
 - unwrap dev_err() message in stmmac_main.c
 - add PTR_ERR() around plat->stmmac_ahb_rst in stmmac_platform.c

v3 changes:
 - add error pointer to dev_err() output
 - add reset_control_assert(stmmac_ahb_rst) in stmmac_dvr_remove
 - revert PTR_ERR() around plat->stmmac_ahb_rst since this is performed
   on the returned value of ret by the calling function
