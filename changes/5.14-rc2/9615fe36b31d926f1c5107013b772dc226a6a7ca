skbuff: Fix build with SKB extensions disabled

We will fail to build with CONFIG_SKB_EXTENSIONS disabled after
8550ff8d8c75 ("skbuff: Release nfct refcount on napi stolen or re-used
skbs") since there is an unconditionally use of skb_ext_find() without
an appropriate stub. Simply build the code conditionally and properly
guard against both COFNIG_SKB_EXTENSIONS as well as
CONFIG_NET_TC_SKB_EXT being disabled.
