x86/fpu/signal: Let xrstor handle the features to init

There is no reason to do an extra XRSTOR from init_fpstate for feature
bits which have been cleared by user space in the FX magic xfeatures
storage.

Just clear them in the task's XSTATE header and do a full restore which
will put these cleared features into init state.

There is no real difference in performance because the current code
already does a full restore when the xfeatures bits are preserved as the
signal frame setup has stored them, which is the full UABI feature set.

 [ bp: Use the negated mxcsr_feature_mask in the MXCSR check. ]
