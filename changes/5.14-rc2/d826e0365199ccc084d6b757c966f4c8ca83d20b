kernfs: move revalidate to be near lookup

While the dentry operation kernfs_dop_revalidate() is grouped with
dentry type functions it also has a strong affinity to the inode
operation ->lookup().

It makes sense to locate this function near to kernfs_iop_lookup()
because we will be adding VFS negative dentry caching to reduce path
lookup overhead for non-existent paths.

There's no functional change from this patch.
