arm64: smp: initialize cpu offset earlier

Now that we have a consistent place to initialize CPU context registers
early in the boot path, let's also initialize the per-cpu offset here.
This makes the primary and secondary boot paths more consistent, and
allows for the use of per-cpu operations earlier, which will be
necessary for instrumentation with KCSAN.

Note that smp_prepare_boot_cpu() still needs to re-initialize CPU0's
offset as immediately prior to this the per-cpu areas may be
reallocated, and hence the boot-time offset may be stale. A comment is
added to make this clear.
