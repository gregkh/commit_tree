memblock: free_unused_memmap: use pageblock units instead of MAX_ORDER

The code that frees unused memory map uses rounds start and end of the
holes that are freed to MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES to preserve continuity of the
memory map for MAX_ORDER regions.

Lots of core memory management functionality relies on homogeneity of the
memory map within each pageblock which size may differ from MAX_ORDER in
certain configurations.

Although currently, for the architectures that use free_unused_memmap(),
pageblock_order and MAX_ORDER are equivalent, it is cleaner to have common
notation thought mm code.

Replace MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES with pageblock_nr_pages and update the comments
to make it more clear why the alignment to pageblock boundaries is
required.
