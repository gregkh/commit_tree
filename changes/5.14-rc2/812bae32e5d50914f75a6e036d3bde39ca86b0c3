ARM: dts: aspeed: Update e3c246d4i vuart properties

This device-tree was merged with a provisional vuart IRQ-polarity
property that was still under review and ended up taking a somewhat
different form.  This patch updates it to match the final form of the
new vuart properties, which additionally allow specifying the SIRQ
number and LPC address.
