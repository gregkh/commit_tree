mm/zsmalloc.c: remove confusing code in obj_free()

Patch series "Cleanup for zsmalloc".

This series contains cleanups to remove confusing code in obj_free(),
combine two atomic ops and improve readability for async_free_zspage().
More details can be found in the respective changelogs.

This patch (of 2):

OBJ_ALLOCATED_TAG is only set for handle to indicate allocated object.
It's irrelevant with obj.  So remove this misleading code to improve
readability.
