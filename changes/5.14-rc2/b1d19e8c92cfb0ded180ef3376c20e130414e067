scsi: iscsi: Add iscsi_cls_conn refcount helpers

There are a couple places where we could free the iscsi_cls_conn while it's
still in use. This adds some helpers to get/put a refcount on the struct
and converts an exiting user. Subsequent commits will then use the helpers
to fix 2 bugs in the eh code.
