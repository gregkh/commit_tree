kvm: debugfs: fix memory leak in kvm_create_vm_debugfs

In commit bc9e9e672df9 ("KVM: debugfs: Reuse binary stats descriptors")
loop for filling debugfs_stat_data was copy-pasted 2 times, but
in the second loop pointers are saved over pointers allocated
in the first loop.  All this causes is a memory leak, fix it.
