mcb: Use DEFINE_RES_MEM() helper macro and fix the end address

Use DEFINE_RES_MEM() to save a couple of lines of code, which makes the
code a bit shorter and easier to read. The start address does not need to
appear twice.

By the way, the value of '.end' should be "start + size - 1". So the
previous writing should have omitted subtracted 1.

Fixes: 73edc8f7ccef ("mcb: Added support for LPC or non PCI based MCB carrier")
