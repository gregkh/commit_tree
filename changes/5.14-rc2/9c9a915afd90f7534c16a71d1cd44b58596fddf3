s390/processor: always inline stap() and __load_psw_mask()

s390 is the only architecture which makes use of the __no_kasan_or_inline
attribute for two functions. Given that both stap() and __load_psw_mask()
are very small functions they can and should be always inlined anyway.

Therefore get rid of __no_kasan_or_inline and always inline these
functions.
