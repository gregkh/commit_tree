dmaengine: ti: omap-dma: Skip pointless cpu_pm context restore on errors

There's no need to restore DMA context on CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER_FAILED as
the DMA context won't be lost on errors.

Note that this does not cause invalid context restore as we already check
for busy DMA with omap_dma_busy() in CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER, and block any
deeper idle states for the SoC by returning NOTIFY_BAD if busy.

If other drivers block deeper idle states with cpu_pm, we now just do a
pointless restore, but only if dma was not busy on CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER.

Let's update the CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER_FAILED handling for correctness,
and add a comment.
