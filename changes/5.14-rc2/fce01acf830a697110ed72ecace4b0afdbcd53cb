powerpc/64e: fix CONFIG_RELOCATABLE build warnings

CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y causes build warnings from unresolved relocations.
Fix these by using TOC addressing for these cases.

Commit 24d33ac5b8ff ("powerpc/64s: Make prom_init require RELOCATABLE")
caused some 64e configs to select RELOCATABLE resulting in these
warnings, but the underlying issue was already there.

This passes basic qemu testing.
