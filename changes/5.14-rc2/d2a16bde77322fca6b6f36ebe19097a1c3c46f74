sfc: add logs explaining XDP_TX/REDIRECT is not available

If it's not possible to allocate enough channels for XDP, XDP_TX and
XDP_REDIRECT don't work. However, only a message saying that not enough
channels were available was shown, but not saying what are the
consequences in that case. The user didn't know if he/she can use XDP
or not, if the performance is reduced, or what.
