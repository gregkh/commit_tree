ipv6: exthdrs: do not blindly use init_net

I see no reason why max_dst_opts_cnt and max_hbh_opts_cnt
are fetched from the initial net namespace.

The other sysctls (max_dst_opts_len & max_hbh_opts_len)
are in fact already using the current ns.

Note: it is not clear why ipv6_destopt_rcv() use two ways to
get to the netns :

 1) dev_net(dst->dev)
    Originally used to increment IPSTATS_MIB_INHDRERRORS

 2) dev_net(skb->dev)
     Tom used this variant in his patch.

Maybe this calls to use ipv6_skb_net() instead ?
