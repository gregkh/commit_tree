habanalabs: enable dram scramble before linux f/w

In current code, for dynamic f/w loading flow, DRAM scrambling is
enabled post Linux fit image is loaded to the card. This can cause the
device CPU to go into reset state.

The correct sequence should be:
1. Load boot fit image
2. Enable scrambling
3. Load Linux fit image

This commit aligns the DRAM scrambling enabling with the static f/w load
flow.
