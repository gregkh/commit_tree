KVM: x86/mmu: Always set new mmu_role immediately after checking old role

Refactor shadow MMU initialization to immediately set its new mmu_role
after verifying it differs from the old role, and so that all flavors
of MMU initialization share the same check-and-set pattern.  Immediately
setting the role will allow future commits to use mmu_role to configure
the MMU without consuming stale state.
