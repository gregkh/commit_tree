regmap: mdio: Fix regmap_bus pointer constness

A const qualifier was omitted in the declaration of the regmap_bus
pointer, resulting in the following errors:

drivers/base/regmap/regmap-mdio.c: In function ‘__regmap_init_mdio’:
drivers/base/regmap/regmap-mdio.c:87:7: warning: assignment discards
‘const’ qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-qualifiers]
   87 |   bus = &regmap_mdio_c22_bus;
      |       ^
drivers/base/regmap/regmap-mdio.c:89:7: warning: assignment discards
‘const’ qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-qualifiers]
   89 |   bus = &regmap_mdio_c45_bus;
      |       ^

Fix this by ensuring the pointer has the same qualifiers as the assigned
values.
