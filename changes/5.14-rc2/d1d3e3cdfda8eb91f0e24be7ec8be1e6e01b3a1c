staging: rtl8712: fix error handling in r871xu_drv_init

Previous error handling path was unique for all
possible errors and there was unnecessary branching.
Also, one step for freeing drv_sw was missing. All
these problems was fixed by restructuring error
handling path.

Also, moved out free_netdev() from r8712_free_drv_sw() for
correct error handling.
