arm64: tegra: Enable SMMU support for USB on Tegra194

As of commit c7289b1c8a4e ("arm64: tegra: Enable SMMU support on
Tegra194"), SMMU support is enabled system-wide on Tegra194. However,
there was a bit of overlap between the SMMU enablement and the USB
support addition, so the USB device tree nodes are missing the iommus
and interconnects properties. This in turn leads to SMMU faults for
these devices, since by default the ARM SMMU will fault.

Add the iommus and interconnects properties to the XUSB and XUDC device
tree nodes to restore their functionality.
