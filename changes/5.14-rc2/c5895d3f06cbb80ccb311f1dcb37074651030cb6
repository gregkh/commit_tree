sched: Simplify sched_info_on()

The situation around sched_info is somewhat complicated, it is used by
sched_stats and delayacct and, indirectly, kvm.

If SCHEDSTATS=Y (but disabled by default) sched_info_on() is
unconditionally true -- this is the case for all distro kernel configs
I checked.

If for some reason SCHEDSTATS=N, but TASK_DELAY_ACCT=Y, then
sched_info_on() can return false when delayacct is disabled,
presumably because there would be no other users left; except kvm is.

Instead of complicating matters further by accurately accounting
sched_stat and kvm state, simply unconditionally enable when
SCHED_INFO=Y, matching the common distro case.
