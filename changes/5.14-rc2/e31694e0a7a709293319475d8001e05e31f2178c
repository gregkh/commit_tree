objtool: Don't make .altinstructions writable

When objtool creates the .altinstructions section, it sets the SHF_WRITE
flag to make the section writable -- unless the section had already been
previously created by the kernel.  The mismatch between kernel-created
and objtool-created section flags can cause failures with external
tooling (kpatch-build).  And the section doesn't need to be writable
anyway.

Make the section flags consistent with the kernel's.
