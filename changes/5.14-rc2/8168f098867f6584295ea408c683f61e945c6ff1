arm64: entry: split bad stack entry

We'd like to keep all the entry sequencing in entry-common.c, as this
will allow us to ensure this is consistent, and free from any unsound
instrumentation.

Currently handle_bad_stack() performs the NMI entry sequence in traps.c.
Let's split the low-level entry sequence from the reporting, moving the
former to entry-common.c and keeping the latter in traps.c. To make it
clear that reporting function never returns, it is renamed to
panic_bad_stack().
