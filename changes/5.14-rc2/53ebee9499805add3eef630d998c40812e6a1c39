iio: afe: iio-rescale: Support processed channels

It happens that an ADC will only provide raw or processed
voltage conversion channels. (adc/ab8500-gpadc.c).
On the Samsung GT-I9070 this is used for a light sensor
and current sense amplifier so we need to think of something.

The idea is to allow processed channels and scale them
with 1/1 and then the rescaler can modify the result
on top.
