scsi: qedi: Wake up if cmd_cleanup_req is set

If we got a response then we should always wake up the conn. For both the
cmd_cleanup_req == 0 or cmd_cleanup_req > 0, we shouldn't dig into
iscsi_itt_to_task because we don't know what the upper layers are doing.

We can also remove the qedi_clear_task_idx call here because once we signal
success libiscsi will loop over the affected commands and end up calling
the cleanup_task callout which will release it.
