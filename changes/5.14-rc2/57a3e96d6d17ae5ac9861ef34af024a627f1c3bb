KVM: x86/mmu: Fix return value in tdp_mmu_map_handle_target_level()

Currently tdp_mmu_map_handle_target_level() returns 0, which is
RET_PF_RETRY, when page fault is actually fixed.  This makes
kvm_tdp_mmu_map() also return RET_PF_RETRY in this case, instead of
RET_PF_FIXED.  Fix by initializing ret to RET_PF_FIXED.

Note that kvm_mmu_page_fault() resumes guest on both RET_PF_RETRY and
RET_PF_FIXED, which means in practice returning the two won't make
difference, so this fix alone won't be necessary for stable tree.
