scsi: zfcp: Report port fc_security as unknown early during remote cable pull

On remote cable pull, a zfcp_port keeps its status and only gets
ZFCP_STATUS_PORT_LINK_TEST added. Only after an ADISC timeout, we would
actually start port recovery and remove ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_UNBLOCKED which
zfcp_sysfs_port_fc_security_show() detected and reported as "unknown"
instead of the old and possibly stale zfcp_port->connection_info.

Add check for ZFCP_STATUS_PORT_LINK_TEST for timely "unknown" report.
