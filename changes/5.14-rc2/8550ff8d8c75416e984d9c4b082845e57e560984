skbuff: Release nfct refcount on napi stolen or re-used skbs

When multiple SKBs are merged to a new skb under napi GRO,
or SKB is re-used by napi, if nfct was set for them in the
driver, it will not be released while freeing their stolen
head state or on re-use.

Release nfct on napi's stolen or re-used SKBs, and
in gro_list_prepare, check conntrack metadata diff.
