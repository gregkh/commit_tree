arm64: entry: add missing noinstr

We intend that all the early exception handling code is marked as
`noinstr`, but we forgot this for __el0_error_handler_common(), which is
called before we have completed entry from user mode. If it were
instrumented, we could run into problems with RCU, lockdep, etc.

Mark it as `noinstr` to prevent this.

The few other functions in entry-common.c which do not have `noinstr` are
called once we've completed entry, and are safe to instrument.
