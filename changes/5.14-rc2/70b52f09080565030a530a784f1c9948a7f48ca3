mmc: block: Disable CMDQ on the ioctl path

According to the eMMC Spec:
"When command queuing is enabled (CMDQ Mode En bit in CMDQ_MODE_EN
field is set to ‘1’) class 11 commands are the only method through
which data transfer tasks can be issued. Existing data transfer
commands, namely CMD18/CMD17 and CMD25/CMD24, are not supported when
command queuing is enabled."
which means if CMDQ is enabled, the FFU commands will not be supported.
To fix this issue, just simply disable CMDQ on the ioctl path, and
re-enable CMDQ once ioctl request is completed.
