ext4: update journal documentation

Add a section about journal checkpointing, including information about
the ioctl EXT4_IOC_CHECKPOINT which can be used to trigger a journal
checkpoint from userspace.

Also, update the journal allocation information to reflect that up to
10240000 blocks are used for the journal and that the journal is not
necessarily contiguous.
