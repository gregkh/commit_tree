drivers/soc/litex: remove 8-bit subregister option

Since upstream LiteX recommends that Linux support be limited to
designs configured with 32-bit CSR subregisters (see commit a2b71fde
in upstream LiteX, https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex), remove
the option to select 8-bit subregisters, significantly reducing the
complexity of LiteX CSR (MMIO register) accessor methods.

NOTE: for details on the underlying mechanics of LiteX CSR registers,
see https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/CSR-Bus or the original
LiteX accessors (litex/soc/software/include/hw/common.h in the upstream
repository).
