serial: tty: uartlite: fix console setup

Remove the hack to assign the global console_port variable at probe time.
This assumption that cons->index is -1 is wrong for systems that specify
'console=' in the cmdline (or 'stdout-path' in dts). Hence, on such system
the actual console assignment is ignored, and the first UART that happens
to be probed is used as console instead.

Move the logic to console_setup() and map the console to the correct port
through the array of available ports instead.
