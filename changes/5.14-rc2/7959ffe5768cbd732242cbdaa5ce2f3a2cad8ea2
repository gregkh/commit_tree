drm/i915/adl_p: Add dedicated SAGV watermarks

XE_LPD reduces the number of regular watermark latency levels from 8
to 6 on non-dgfx platforms.  However the hardware also adds a special
purpose SAGV wateramrk (and an accompanying transition watermark) that
will be used by the hardware in place of the level 0 values during SAGV
transitions.
