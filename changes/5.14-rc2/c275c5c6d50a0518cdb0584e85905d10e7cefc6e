kasan: disable freed user page poisoning with HW tags

Poisoning freed pages protects against kernel use-after-free. The
likelihood of such a bug involving kernel pages is significantly higher
than that for user pages. At the same time, poisoning freed pages can
impose a significant performance cost, which cannot always be justified
for user pages given the lower probability of finding a bug. Therefore,
disable freed user page poisoning when using HW tags. We identify
"user" pages via the flag set GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE, which indicates
a strong likelihood of not being directly accessible to the kernel.
