scsi: 3w-9xxx: Fix endianness issues in command packets

The controller expects all data it sends/receives to be little-endian.
Therefore, the packet struct definitions should use the __le16/32/64
types. Once those are correct, sparse reports several issues with the
driver code, which are fixed here as well.

The main issue observed was at the call to scsi_set_resid(), where the
byteswapped parameter would eventually trigger the alignment check at
drivers/scsi/sd.c:2009. At that point, the kernel would continuously
complain about an "Unaligned partial completion", and no further I/O could
occur.

This gets the controller working on big endian powerpc64.
