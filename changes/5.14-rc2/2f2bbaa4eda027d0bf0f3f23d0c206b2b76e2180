arm64: entry: organise entry handlers consistently

In entry.S we have two comments which distinguish EL0 and EL1 exception
handlers, but the code isn't actually laid out to match, and there are a
few other inconsistencies that would be good to clear up.

This patch organizes the entry handers consistently:

* The handlers are laid out in order of the vectors, to make them easier
  to navigate.

* The inconsistently-applied alignment is removed

* The handlers are consistently marked with SYM_CODE_START_LOCAL()
  rather than SYM_CODE_START_LOCAL_NOALIGN(), giving them the same
  default alignment as other assembly code snippets.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
