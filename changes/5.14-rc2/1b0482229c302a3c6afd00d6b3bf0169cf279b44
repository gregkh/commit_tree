powerpc/64s/interrupt: preserve regs->softe for NMI interrupts

If an NMI interrupt hits in an implicit soft-masked region, regs->softe
is modified to reflect that. This may not be necessary for correctness
at the moment, but it is less surprising and it's unhelpful when
debugging or adding checks.

Make sure this is changed back to how it was found before returning.
