arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Rename speedbin node

The speedbin value blown in the efuse is used to determine is used to
determine the voltage and frequency value for different IPs, including
GPU, CPUs... So it's really not a gpu specific information.

This patch simply renames 'gpu_speed_bin' node to 'speedbin'.
