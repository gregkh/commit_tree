net: ipv6: fix return value of ip6_skb_dst_mtu

Commit 628a5c561890 ("[INET]: Add IP(V6)_PMTUDISC_RPOBE") introduced
ip6_skb_dst_mtu with return value of signed int which is inconsistent
with actually returned values. Also 2 users of this function actually
assign its value to unsigned int variable and only __xfrm6_output
assigns result of this function to signed variable but actually uses
as unsigned in further comparisons and calls. Change this function
to return unsigned int value.
