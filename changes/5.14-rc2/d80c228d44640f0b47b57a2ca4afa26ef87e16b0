block: fix the problem of io_ticks becoming smaller

On the IO submission path, blk_account_io_start() may interrupt
the system interruption. When the interruption returns, the value
of part->stamp may have been updated by other cores, so the time
value collected before the interruption may be less than part->
stamp. So when this happens, we should do nothing to make io_ticks
more accurate? For kernels less than 5.0, this may cause io_ticks
to become smaller, which in turn may cause abnormal ioutil values.
