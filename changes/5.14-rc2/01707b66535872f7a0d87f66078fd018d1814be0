x86/fpu: Rename "dynamic" XSTATEs to "independent"

The salient feature of "dynamic" XSTATEs is that they are not part of the
main task XSTATE buffer.  The fact that they are dynamically allocated is
irrelevant and will become quite confusing when user math XSTATEs start
being dynamically allocated.  Rename them to "independent" because they
are independent of the main XSTATE code.

This is just a search-and-replace with some whitespace updates to keep
things aligned.
