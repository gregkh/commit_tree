KVM: x86: Use kernel's x86_phys_bits to handle reduced MAXPHYADDR

Use boot_cpu_data.x86_phys_bits instead of the raw CPUID information to
enumerate the MAXPHYADDR for KVM guests when TDP is disabled (the guest
version is only relevant to NPT/TDP).

When using shadow paging, any reductions to the host's MAXPHYADDR apply
to KVM and its guests as well, i.e. using the raw CPUID info will cause
KVM to misreport the number of PA bits available to the guest.

Unconditionally zero out the "Physical Address bit reduction" entry.
For !TDP, the adjustment is already done, and for TDP enumerating the
host's reduction is wrong as the reduction does not apply to GPAs.
