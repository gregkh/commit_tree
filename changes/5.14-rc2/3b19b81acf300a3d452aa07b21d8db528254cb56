KVM: nVMX: Release enlightened VMCS on VMCLEAR

Unlike VMREAD/VMWRITE/VMPTRLD, VMCLEAR is a valid instruction when
enlightened VMCS is in use. TLFS has the following brief description:
"The L1 hypervisor can execute a VMCLEAR instruction to transition an
enlightened VMCS from the active to the non-active state". Normally,
this change can be ignored as unmapping active eVMCS can be postponed
until the next VMLAUNCH instruction but in case nested state is migrated
with KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE/KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE, keeping eVMCS mapped
may result in its synchronization with VMCS12 and this is incorrect:
L1 hypervisor is free to reuse inactive eVMCS memory for something else.

Inactive eVMCS after VMCLEAR can just be unmapped.
