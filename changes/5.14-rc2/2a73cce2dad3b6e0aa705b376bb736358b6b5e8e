scripts/setlocalversion: remove mercurial, svn and git-svn supports

The mercurial, svn, git-svn supports were added by the following commits:

 - 3dce174cfcba ("kbuild: support mercurial in setlocalversion")

 - ba3d05fb6369 ("kbuild: add svn revision information to setlocalversion")

 - ff80aa97c9b4 ("setlocalversion: add git-svn support")

They did not explain why they are useful for the kernel source tree.
Let's revert all of them, and see if somebody will complain about it.
