drm/amd/display: force CP to DESIRED when removing display

[WHY]
- Commit from userspace could cause link stream to disable and hdcp
auth to reset when the HDCP has already been enabled at the moment.
CP should fall back to DESIRED from ENABLED in such cases.
- This change was previously reverted due to a regression caused, which
has now been cleared.

[HOW]
In hdcp display removal, change CP to DESIRED if at the moment CP
is ENABLED before the auth reset and removal of linked list element.
