bpf, devmap: Convert remaining READ_ONCE() to rcu_dereference_check()

There were a couple of READ_ONCE()-invocations left-over by the devmap
RCU conversion. Convert these to rcu_dereference_check() as well to avoid
complaints from sparse.

Fixes: 782347b6bcad ("xdp: Add proper __rcu annotations to redirect map entries")
