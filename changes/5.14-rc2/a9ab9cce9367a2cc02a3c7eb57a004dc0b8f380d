rcu-tasks: Don't delete holdouts within trc_wait_for_one_reader()

Invoking trc_del_holdout() from within trc_wait_for_one_reader() is
only a performance optimization because the RCU Tasks Trace grace-period
kthread will eventually do this within check_all_holdout_tasks_trace().
But it is not a particularly important performance optimization because
it only applies to the grace-period kthread, of which there is but one.
This commit therefore removes this invocation of trc_del_holdout() in
favor of the one in check_all_holdout_tasks_trace() in the grace-period
kthread.
