ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Fix for loop increment in scarlett2_usb_get_config

Clang warns:

sound/usb/mixer_scarlett_gen2.c:1189:32: warning: expression result

It appears the intention was to cast the void pointer to a u16 pointer
so that the data could be iterated through like an array of u16 values.
However, the cast happens after the increment because a cast is an
rvalue, whereas the post-increment operator only works on lvalues, so
the loop does not iterate as expected. This is not a bug in practice
because count is not greater than one at the moment but this could
change in the future so this should be fixed.

Replace the cast with a temporary variable of the proper type, which is
less error prone and fixes the iteration. Do the same thing for the
'u8 *' below this if block.
