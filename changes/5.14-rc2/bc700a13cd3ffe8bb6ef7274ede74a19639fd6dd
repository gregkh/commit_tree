media: sti/hva: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
added pm_runtime_resume_and_get() in order to automatically handle
dev->power.usage_count decrement on errors.

While the hva driver does it right, there are lots of errors
on other drivers due to its misusage. So, let's change
this driver to also use pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), as we're
doing similar changes all over the media subsystem.
