scsi: elx: efct: Fix pointer error checking in debugfs init

debugfs_create_xxx routines, which return pointers, are being checked for
error by looking for NULL values. The routines may return pointer-munged
-Exxx codes, so they should be using IS_ERR() to adapt.

There are two cases:

 - The first case is on initial directory creation, which actually doesn't
   need to be checked. So remove the check.

 - Creation of the sessions subdirectory. Modify this creation to create
   under the initial directory created, and fix failure check.
