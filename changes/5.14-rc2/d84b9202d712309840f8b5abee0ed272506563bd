media: cedrus: Fix .buf_prepare

The driver should only set the payload on .buf_prepare if the
buffer is CAPTURE type. If an OUTPUT buffer has a zero bytesused
set by userspace then v4l2-core will set it to buffer length.

If we overwrite bytesused for OUTPUT buffers, too, then
vb2_get_plane_payload() will return incorrect value which might be then
written to hw registers by the driver in cedrus_h264.c or cedrus_vp8.c.
