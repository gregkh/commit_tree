drm/msm/disp/dpu1: avoid perf update in frame done event

Crtc perf update from frame event work can result in
wrong bandwidth and clock update from dpu if the work
is scheduled after the swap state has happened.

Avoid such issues by moving perf update to complete
commit once the frame is accepted by the hardware.
