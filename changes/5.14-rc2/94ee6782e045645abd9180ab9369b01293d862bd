mmc: sdhci-acpi: Disable write protect detection on Toshiba Encore 2 WT8-B

On the Toshiba Encore 2 WT8-B the  microSD slot always reports the card
being write-protected even though microSD cards do not have a write-protect
switch at all.

Add a new DMI_QUIRK_SD_NO_WRITE_PROTECT quirk entry to sdhci-acpi.c's
DMI quirk table for this.
