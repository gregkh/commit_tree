staging: fbtft: Rectify GPIO handling

The infamous commit c440eee1a7a1 ("Staging: staging: fbtft: Switch to
the GPIO descriptor interface") broke GPIO handling completely.
It has already four commits to rectify and it seems not enough.
In order to fix the mess here we:

  1) Set default to "inactive" for all requested pins

  2) Fix CS#, RD#, and WR# pins polarity since it's active low
     and GPIO descriptor interface takes it into consideration
     from the Device Tree or ACPI

  3) Consolidate chip activation (CS# assertion) under default
     ->reset() callback

To summarize the expectations about polarity for GPIOs:

   RD#			Low
   WR#			Low
   CS#			Low
   RESET#		Low
   DC or RS		High
   RW			High
   Data	0 .. 15		High

See also Adafruit learning course [1] for the example of the schematics.

While at it, drop unneeded NULL checks, since GPIO API is tolerant to that.
