tty: make tty_get_{char,frame}_size available

Many tty drivers contain code to compute bits count depending on termios
cflags. So extract this code from serial core to two separate tty helper
functions:
* tty_get_char_size -- only size of a character, without flags,
* tty_get_frame_size -- complete size of a frame including flags.

In the next patch, calls to these new functions replace many copies of
this code.

Note that we accept only cflag as a parameter. That's because some
callers like pch_uart_startup or sunsab_console_setup don't have at hand
termios which we could pass around.
