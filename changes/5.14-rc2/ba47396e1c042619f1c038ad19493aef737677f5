Revert "bpf: Check for BPF_F_ADJ_ROOM_FIXED_GSO when bpf_skb_change_proto"

This reverts commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e.

See the followup commit for the reasoning why I believe the appropriate
approach is to simply make this change without a flag, but it can basically
be summarized as using this helper without the flag is bug-prone or outright
buggy, and thus the default should be this new behaviour.

As this commit has only made it into net-next/master, but not into
any real release, such a backwards incompatible change is still ok.
