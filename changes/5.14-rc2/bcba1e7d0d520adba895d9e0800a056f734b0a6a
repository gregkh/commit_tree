take LOOKUP_{ROOT,ROOT_GRABBED,JUMPED} out of LOOKUP_... space

Separate field in nameidata (nd->state) holding the flags that
should be internal-only - that way we both get some spare bits
in LOOKUP_... and get simpler rules for nd->root lifetime rules,
since we can set the replacement of LOOKUP_ROOT (ND_ROOT_PRESET)
at the same time we set nd->root.
