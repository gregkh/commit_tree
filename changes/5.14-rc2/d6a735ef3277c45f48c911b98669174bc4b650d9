perf bpf_counter: Move common functions to bpf_counter.h

Some helper functions will be used for cgroup counting too.  Move them
to a header file for sharing.

Committer notes:

Fix the build on older systems with:

  -       struct bpf_map_info map_info = {0};
  +       struct bpf_map_info map_info = { .id = 0, };

This wasn't breaking the build in such systems as bpf_counter.c isn't
built due to:

tools/perf/util/Build:

  perf-$(CONFIG_PERF_BPF_SKEL) += bpf_counter.o

The bpf_counter.h file on the other hand is included from places that
are built everywhere.
