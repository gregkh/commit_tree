selftests: forwarding: Add test for custom multipath hash

Test that when the hash policy is set to custom, traffic is distributed
only according to the outer fields set in the fib_multipath_hash_fields
sysctl.

Each time set a different field and make sure traffic is only
distributed when the field is changed in the packet stream.

The test only verifies the behavior with non-encapsulated IPv4 and IPv6
packets. Subsequent patches will add tests for IPv4/IPv6 overlays on top
of IPv4/IPv6 underlay networks.

Example output:

 # ./custom_multipath_hash.sh
