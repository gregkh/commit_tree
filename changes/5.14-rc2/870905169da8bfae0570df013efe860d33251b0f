rcu/nocb: Prepare for fine-grained deferred wakeup

Tuning the deferred wakeup level must be done from a safe wakeup
point. Currently those sites are:

* ->nocb_timer
* user/idle/guest entry
* CPU down
* softirq/rcuc

All of these sites perform the wake up for both RCU_NOCB_WAKE and
RCU_NOCB_WAKE_FORCE.

In order to merge ->nocb_timer and ->nocb_bypass_timer together, we plan
to add a new RCU_NOCB_WAKE_BYPASS that really should be deferred until
a timer fires so that we don't wake up the NOCB-gp kthread too early.

To prepare for that, this commit specifies the per-callsite wakeup
level/limit.
