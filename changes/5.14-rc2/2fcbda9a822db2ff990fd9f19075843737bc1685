Input: pm8941-pwrkey - add support for PMK8350 PON_HLOS PMIC peripheral

On Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMIC PMK8350, the PON peripheral
is split into two peripherals: PON_HLOS and PON_PBS.  The
application processor only has write access to PON_HLOS which
limits it to only receiving PON interrupts.

Add support for the PMK8350 PON_HLOS peripheral so that its
KPDPWR_N and RESIN_N interrupts can be used to detect key
presses.
