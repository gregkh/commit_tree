sctp: move 198 addresses from unusable to private scope

The doc draft-stewart-tsvwg-sctp-ipv4-00 that restricts 198 addresses
was never published. These addresses as private addresses should be
allowed to use in SCTP.

As Michael Tuexen suggested, this patch is to move 198 addresses from
unusable to private scope.
