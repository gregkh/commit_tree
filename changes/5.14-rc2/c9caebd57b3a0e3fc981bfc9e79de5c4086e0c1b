media: hantro: merge Rockchip platform drivers

Merge the two Rockchip platform drivers into one as it was suggested at
[1] and [2].
This will hopefully make it easier to add new variants (which are surely
to come for Rockchip).
Also rename from "rk3288" to "v(d/e)pu1" and "rk3399" to "v(d/e)pu2"
where applicable, as this is the dicition the vendor uses and will
also refelect the variants that get added later in this series. Rename
from "rk3288" to "rockchip" if applicable to both hardware versions.
