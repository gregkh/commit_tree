ACPI: Check StorageD3Enable _DSD property in ACPI code

Although first implemented for NVME, this check may be usable by
other drivers as well. Microsoft's specification explicitly mentions
that is may be usable by SATA and AHCI devices.  Google also indicates
that they have used this with SDHCI in a downstream kernel tree that
a user can plug a storage device into.
