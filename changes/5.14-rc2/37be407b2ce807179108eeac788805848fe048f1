KVM: nSVM: Fix L1 state corruption upon return from SMM

VMCB split commit 4995a3685f1b ("KVM: SVM: Use a separate vmcb for the
nested L2 guest") broke return from SMM when we entered there from guest
(L2) mode. Gen2 WS2016/Hyper-V is known to do this on boot. The problem
manifests itself like this:

  kvm_exit:             reason EXIT_RSM rip 0x7ffbb280 info 0 0
  kvm_emulate_insn:     0:7ffbb280: 0f aa

Note: return to L2 succeeded but upon first exit to L1 its RIP points to
'RSM' instruction but we're not in SMM.

The problem appears to be that VMCB01 gets irreversibly destroyed during
SMM execution. Previously, we used to have 'hsave' VMCB where regular
(pre-SMM) L1's state was saved upon nested_svm_vmexit() but now we just
switch to VMCB01 from VMCB02.

Pre-split (working) flow looked like:
- SMM is triggered during L2's execution
- L2's state is pushed to SMRAM
- nested_svm_vmexit() restores L1's state from 'hsave'
- SMM -> RSM
- enter_svm_guest_mode() switches to L2 but keeps 'hsave' intact so we have
  pre-SMM (and pre L2 VMRUN) L1's state there
- L2's state is restored from SMRAM
- upon first exit L1's state is restored from L1.

This was always broken with regards to svm_get_nested_state()/
svm_set_nested_state(): 'hsave' was never a part of what's being
save and restored so migration happening during SMM triggered from L2 would
never restore L1's state correctly.

Post-split flow (broken) looks like:
- SMM is triggered during L2's execution
- L2's state is pushed to SMRAM
- nested_svm_vmexit() switches to VMCB01 from VMCB02
- SMM -> RSM
- enter_svm_guest_mode() switches from VMCB01 to VMCB02 but pre-SMM VMCB01
  is already lost.
- L2's state is restored from SMRAM
- upon first exit L1's state is restored from VMCB01 but it is corrupted
 (reflects the state during 'RSM' execution).

VMX doesn't have this problem because unlike VMCB, VMCS keeps both guest
and host state so when we switch back to VMCS02 L1's state is intact there.

To resolve the issue we need to save L1's state somewhere. We could've
created a third VMCB for SMM but that would require us to modify saved
state format. L1's architectural HSAVE area (pointed by MSR_VM_HSAVE_PA)
seems appropriate: L0 is free to save any (or none) of L1's state there.
Currently, KVM does 'none'.

Note, for nested state migration to succeed, both source and destination
hypervisors must have the fix. We, however, don't need to create a new
flag indicating the fact that HSAVE area is now populated as migration
during SMM triggered from L2 was always broken.
