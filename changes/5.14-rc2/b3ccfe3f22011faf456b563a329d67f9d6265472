staging: rtl8188eu: remove all DBG_88E calls from hal/usb_halinit.c

Remove all DBG_88E calls from hal/usb_halinit.c as this macro is
unnecessary, and many of these calls are dubious in terms of necessity.
Removing all calls will ultimately allow the removal of the macro
itself. Also remove unused jiffies variable from the start of
rtl8188eu_hal_init.
