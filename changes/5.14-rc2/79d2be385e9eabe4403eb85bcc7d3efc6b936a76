octeontx2-pf: offload DMAC filters to CGX/RPM block

DMAC filtering can be achieved by either NPC MCAM rules or
CGX/RPM MAC filters. Currently we are achieving this by NPC
MCAM rules. This patch offloads DMAC filters to CGX/RPM MAC
filters instead of NPC MCAM rules. Offloading DMAC filter to
CGX/RPM block helps in reducing traffic to NPC block and
save MCAM rules
