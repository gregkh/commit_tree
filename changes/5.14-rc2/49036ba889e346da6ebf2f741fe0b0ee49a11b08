mmc: sdhci: Clear unused bounce buffer at DMA mmap error path

When DMA-mapping of the bounce buffer fails, the driver tries to fall
back, but it leaves the allocated host->bounce_buffer although its
size is zero.  Later on, the driver checks the use of bounce buffer
with host->bounce_buffer pointer, and it tries to use the buffer
incorrectly, resulting in Oops.

This patch clears the release the unused buffer and clears the
bounce_buffer pointer for addressing the problem.
