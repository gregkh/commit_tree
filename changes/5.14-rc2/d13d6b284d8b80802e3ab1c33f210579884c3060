ALSA: firewire-motu: add support for MOTU 828

MOTU 828 is a first model in MOTU FireWire series, produced in 2001. This
model consists of three chips:
 * Texas Instruments TSB41AB1 (Physical layer for IEEE 1394 bus)
 * Philips Semiconductors 1394L21BE (Link layer for IEEE 1394 bus and
   packet processing layer)
 * QuickLogic QuickRAM QL4016 (Data block processing layer and digital
   signal processing)

This commit adds a support for this model, with its unique protocol as
version 1. The features of this protocol are:

 * no MIDI support.
 * Rx packets have no data chunks for control and status messages.
 * Tx packets have 2 data chunks for control and status messages in the
   end of each data block. The chunks consist of data block counter
   (4 byte) and message (2 byte).
 * All of settings are represented in bit flag in one quadlet address
   (0x'ffff'f000'0b00).
 * When optical interface is configured as S/PDIF, signals of the interface
   is multiplexed for packets, instead of signals of coaxial interface.
 * The internal multiplexer is not configured by software.

I note that the device has a quirk to mute output voluntarily during
receiving batch of packets in the beginning of packet streaming. The
operation to unmute should be done by software enough after the device
shifts the state, however it's not deterministic. Furthermore, just
after switching rate of sampling clock, the device keeps the state longer.
This patch manages to sleep 100 msec before unmute operation, but it may
fail to release the mute in the case that the rate is changed. As a
workaround, users can restart packet streaming at the same rate, or write
to specific register from userspace.
