mptcp: setsockopt: handle SOL_SOCKET in one place only

Move the pre-check to the function that handles all SOL_SOCKET values.

At this point there is complete coverage for all values that were
accepted by the pre-check.

BUSYPOLL functions are accepted but will not have any functionality
yet until its clear how the expected mptcp behaviour should look like.
