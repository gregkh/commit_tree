arm64: Add cpuidle context save/restore helpers

As we need to start doing some additional work on all idle
paths, let's introduce a set of macros that will perform
the work related to the GICv3 pseudo-NMI idle entry exit.

Stubs are introduced to 32bit ARM for compatibility.
As these helpers are currently unused, there is no functional
change.
