arm64: dts: meson-sm1-odroid-c4: remove invalid hub_5v regulator

Drop the hub_5v regulator which controls the HUB Reset line with GPIOH_4 which
is already controlled by a GPIO HOG.

Until we can properly describe how to control USB HUBs reset lines, keeping
the GPIO HOG is an acceptable solution we use on multiple boards.
