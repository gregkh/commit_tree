powerpc/vas: Move update_csb/dump_crb to common book3s platform

If a coprocessor encounters an error translating an address, the
VAS will cause an interrupt in the host. The kernel processes
the fault by updating CSB. This functionality is same for both
powerNV and pseries. So this patch moves these functions to
common vas-api.c and the actual functionality is not changed.
