ibmvnic: retry reset if there are no other resets

Normally, if a reset fails due to failover or other communication error
there is another reset (eg: FAILOVER) in the queue and we would process
that reset. But if we are unable to communicate with PHYP or VIOS after
H_FREE_CRQ, there would be no other resets in the queue and the adapter
would be in an undefined state even though it was in the OPEN state
earlier. While starting the reset we set the carrier to off state so
we won't even get the timeout resets.

If the last queued reset fails, retry it as a hard reset (after the
usual 60 second settling time).
