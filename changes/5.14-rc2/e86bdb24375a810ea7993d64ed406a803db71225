scripts: kernel-doc: reduce repeated regex expressions into variables

There are some regex expressions in the kernel-doc script, which are used
repeatedly in the script.

Reduce such expressions into variables, which can be used everywhere.

A quick manual check found that no errors and warnings were added/removed
in this process.
