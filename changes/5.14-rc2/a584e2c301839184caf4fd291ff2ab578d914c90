drm/meson: dw-hdmi: disable DW-HDMI CEC sub-driver

On the Amlogic SoCs, the DW-HDMI HW support is here but the DW-HDMI CEC signal
is not connected to a physical pin, leading to confusion when the dw-hdmi cec
controller can't communicate on the bus.

Disable it to avoid exposing a non-functinal bus.
