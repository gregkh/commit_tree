drm/i915/adl_p: Disable FIFO underrun recovery

The FIFO underrun recovery mechanism has a boatload of cases
where it can't be used. The description is also a bit ambiguous
as it doesn't specify whether plane downscaling needs to be considered
or just pipe downscaling. We may not even have sufficient state
tracking to decide this on demand, so for now just disable the
whole thing.
