net: broadcom: bcm4908_enet: reset DMA rings sw indexes properly

Resetting software indexes in bcm4908_dma_alloc_buf_descs() is not
enough as it's called during device probe only. Driver resets DMA on
every .ndo_open callback and it's required to reset indexes then.

This fixes inconsistent rings state and stalled traffic after interface
down & up sequence.
