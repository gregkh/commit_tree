This is an use-after-free issue caused by not updating asoc->shkey after
it was replaced in the key list asoc->endpoint_shared_keys, and the old
key was freed.

This patch is to fix by also updating active_key for asoc when old key is
being replaced with a new one. Note that this issue doesn't exist in
sctp_auth_del_key_id(), as it's not allowed to delete the active_key
from the asoc.
