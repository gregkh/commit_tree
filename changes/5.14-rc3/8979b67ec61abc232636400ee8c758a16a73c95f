iio: potentiostat: lmp91000: Fix alignment of buffer in iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()

Add __aligned(8) to ensure the buffer passed to
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() is suitable for the naturally
aligned timestamp that will be inserted.

Here structure is not used, because this buffer is also used
elsewhere in the driver.
