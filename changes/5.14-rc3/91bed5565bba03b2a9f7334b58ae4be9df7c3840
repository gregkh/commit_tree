Revert "qed: fix possible unpaired spin_{un}lock_bh in _qed_mcp_cmd_and_union()"

This reverts commit 6206b7981a36476f4695d661ae139f7db36a802d.

That patch added additional spin_{un}lock_bh(), which was harmless
but pointless. The orginal code path has guaranteed the pair of
spin_{un}lock_bh().

We'd better revert it before we find the exact root cause of the
bug_on mentioned in that patch.
