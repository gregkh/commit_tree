cfg80211: allow advertising vendor-specific capabilities

There may be cases where vendor-specific elements need to be
used over the air. Rather than have driver or firmware add
them and possibly cause problems that way, add them to the
iftype-data band capabilities. This way we can advertise to
userspace first, and use them in mac80211 next.
