mm: gup: pack has_pinned in MMF_HAS_PINNED

has_pinned 32bit can be packed in the MMF_HAS_PINNED bit as a noop
cleanup.

Any atomic_inc/dec to the mm cacheline shared by all threads in pin-fast
would reintroduce a loss of SMP scalability to pin-fast, so there's no
future potential usefulness to keep an atomic in the mm for this.

set_bit(MMF_HAS_PINNED) will be theoretically a bit slower than WRITE_ONCE
(atomic_set is equivalent to WRITE_ONCE), but the set_bit (just like
atomic_set after this commit) has to be still issued only once per "mm",
so the difference between the two will be lost in the noise.

will-it-scale "mmap2" shows no change in performance with enterprise
config as expected.

will-it-scale "pin_fast" retains the > 4000% SMP scalability performance
improvement against upstream as expected.

This is a noop as far as overall performance and SMP scalability are
concerned.
