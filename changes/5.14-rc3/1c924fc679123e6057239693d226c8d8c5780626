clk: renesas: div6: Consider all parents for requested rate

Currently the .determine_rate() callback considers only the current
parent clock, limiting the range of achievable clock rates on DIV6
clocks with multiple parents, as found on SH/R-Mobile SoCs.

Extend the callback to consider all available parent clocks.
