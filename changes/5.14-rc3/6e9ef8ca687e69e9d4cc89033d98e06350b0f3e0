hwmon: (pmbus/bpa-rs600) Handle Vin readings >= 256V

The BPA-RS600 doesn't follow the PMBus spec for linear data.
Specifically it treats the mantissa as an unsigned 11-bit value instead
of a two's complement 11-bit value. At this point it's unclear whether
this only affects Vin or if Pin/Pout1 are affected as well. Erring on
the side of caution only Vin is dealt with here.
