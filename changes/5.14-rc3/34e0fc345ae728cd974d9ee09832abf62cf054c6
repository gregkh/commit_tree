arm64: tegra: Enable audio IOMMU support on Tegra194

Add iommus and interconnects properties to the sound device tree node on
Tegra194. This ensures that the correct SID is used for translation of
physical to I/O virtual addresses and that the path to system memory is
properly described, which in turn can impact the range of memory that
the device can address.
