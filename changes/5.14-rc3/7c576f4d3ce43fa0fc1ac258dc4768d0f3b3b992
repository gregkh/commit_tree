powerpc: Convert irq_domain_add_legacy_isa use to irq_domain_add_legacy

irq_domain_add_legacy_isa is a pain. It only exists for the benefit of
two PPC-specific drivers, and creates an ugly dependency between asm/irq.h
and linux/irqdomain.h

Instead, let's convert these two drivers to irq_domain_add_legacy(),
stop using NUM_ISA_INTERRUPTS by directly setting NR_IRQS_LEGACY.

The dependency cannot be broken yet as there is a lot of PPC-related
code that depends on it, but that's the first step towards it.

A followup patch will remove irq_domain_add_legacy_isa.
