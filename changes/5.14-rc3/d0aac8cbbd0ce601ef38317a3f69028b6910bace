ARM: dts: sun8i: r40: add devicetree for Forlinx FETA40i-C & OKA40i-C

The FETA40i-C is a SoM by Forlinx based on the Allwinner R40/A40i.

SoM specifications:

- SoC: R40 or A40i
- PMIC: AXP221S
- RAM: 1GiB/2GiB DDR3 (dual-rank)
- eMMC: 8GB,
- Mates with carrier board via four 80-pin connectors (AXK6F80337YG).

OKA40i-C is a carrier board by the same manufacturer for this SoM,
whose main purpose is as a development board with a wide variety of
peripherals:

- Power: DC5V barrel or USB OTG or 4.2V Lipo battery
- Video out: HDMI, TV out, LVDS
- WiFi+Bluetooth: RL-UM02WBS-8723BU-V1.2 (802.11 b/g/n, BT V2.1/3.0/4.0)
- Ethernet: 10/100Mbps
- Storage: ÂµSD, fullsize SD, eMMC (on SoM), SATA
- USB: 3 x USB2.0 Host (2 via hub, 1 native), 1 x USB2.0 OTG (micro-B)
- UART: RS232, RS485, 4 3.3v uarts (of which 2 have RTS/CTS)
- Other I/O: SPI x2, TWI, SDIO header, GPIO header, JTAG header
- Mini PCIe slot with sim holder for WLAN modem
- Smart card holder
- RTC (RX8010SJ)
- Two user LEDs
- Three user buttons (via KeyADC).

This patch adds a devicetree for the aforementioned SoM and devboard.
In order to reflect the modularity of this devboard and simplify adding
support for future hardware based on the same SoM, the devicetree is split:
Everything pertaining to the SoM itself is described in a separate .dtsi
file, which is included by the devboard's .dts.
