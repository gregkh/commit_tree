riscv: Fix memory_limit for 64-bit kernel

As described in Documentation/riscv/vm-layout.rst, the end of the
virtual address space for 64-bit kernel is occupied by the modules/BPF/
kernel mappings so this actually reduces the amount of memory we are able
to map and then use in the linear mapping. So make sure this limit is
correctly set.
