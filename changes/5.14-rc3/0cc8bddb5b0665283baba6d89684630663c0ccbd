net: phy: abort loading yt8511 driver in unsupported modes

While investigating the clang `ge` uninitialized variable report, it was
discovered the default switch would have unintended consequences. Due to
the switch to __phy_modify, the driver would modify the ID values in the
default scenario.

Fix this by promoting the interface mode switch and aborting when the
mode is not a supported RGMII mode.

This prevents the `ge` and `fe` variables from ever being used
uninitialized.
