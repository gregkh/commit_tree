KVM: LAPIC: Keep stored TMCCT register value 0 after KVM_SET_LAPIC

KVM_GET_LAPIC stores the current value of TMCCT and KVM_SET_LAPIC's memcpy
stores it in vcpu->arch.apic->regs, KVM_SET_LAPIC could store zero in
vcpu->arch.apic->regs after it uses it, and then the stored value would
always be zero. In addition, the TMCCT is always computed on-demand and
never directly readable.
