powerpc/pseries/vas: Include irqdomain.h

There are patches in flight to break the dependency between asm/irq.h
and linux/irqdomain.h, which would break compilation of vas.c because it
needs the declaration of irq_create_mapping() etc.

So add an explicit include of irqdomain.h to avoid that becoming a
problem in future.
