printk: fix cpu lock ordering

The cpu lock implementation uses a full memory barrier to take
the lock, but no memory barriers when releasing the lock. This
means that changes performed by a lock owner may not be seen by
the next lock owner. This may have been "good enough" for use
by dump_stack() as a serialization mechanism, but it is not
enough to provide proper protection for a critical section.

Correct this problem by using acquire/release memory barriers
for lock/unlock, respectively.
