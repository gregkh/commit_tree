iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Move the adreno smmu specific impl

Adreno(GPU) SMMU and APSS(Application Processor SubSystem) SMMU
both implement "arm,mmu-500" in some QTI SoCs and to run through
adreno smmu specific implementation such as enabling split pagetables
support, we need to match the "qcom,adreno-smmu" compatible first
before apss smmu or else we will be running apps smmu implementation
for adreno smmu and the additional features for adreno smmu is never
set. For ex: we have "qcom,sc7280-smmu-500" compatible for both apps
and adreno smmu implementing "arm,mmu-500", so the adreno smmu
implementation is never reached because the current sequence checks
for apps smmu compatible(qcom,sc7280-smmu-500) first and runs that
specific impl and we never reach adreno smmu specific implementation.
