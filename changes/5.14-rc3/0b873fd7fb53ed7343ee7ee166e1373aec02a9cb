KVM: x86/mmu: Remove redundant is_tdp_mmu_enabled check

This check is redundant because the root shadow page will only be a TDP
MMU page if is_tdp_mmu_enabled() returns true, and is_tdp_mmu_enabled()
never changes for the lifetime of a VM.

It's possible that this check was added for performance reasons but it
is unlikely that it is useful in practice since to_shadow_page() is
cheap. That being said, this patch also caches the return value of
is_tdp_mmu_root() in direct_page_fault() since there's no reason to
duplicate the call so many times, so performance is not a concern.
