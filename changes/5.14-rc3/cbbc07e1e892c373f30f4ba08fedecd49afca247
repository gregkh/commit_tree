usb: host: move EH SINGLE_STEP_SET_FEATURE implementation to core

It is needed at USB Certification test for Embedded Host 2.0, and
the detail is at CH6.4.1.1 of On-The-Go and Embedded Host Supplement
to the USB Revision 2.0 Specification. Since other USB 2.0 capable
host like XHCI also need it, so move it to HCD core.
