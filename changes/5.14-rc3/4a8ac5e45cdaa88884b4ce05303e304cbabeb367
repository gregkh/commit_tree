i2c: mpc: Poll for MCF

During some transfers the bus can still be busy when an interrupt is
received. Commit 763778cd7926 ("i2c: mpc: Restore reread of I2C status
register") attempted to address this by re-reading MPC_I2C_SR once but
that just made it less likely to happen without actually preventing it.
Instead of a single re-read, poll with a timeout so that the bus is given
enough time to settle but a genuine stuck SCL is still noticed.
