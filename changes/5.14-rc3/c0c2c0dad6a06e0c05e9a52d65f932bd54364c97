lockdep/selftests: Fix selftests vs PROVE_RAW_LOCK_NESTING

When PROVE_RAW_LOCK_NESTING=y many of the selftests FAILED because
HARDIRQ context is out-of-bounds for spinlocks. Instead make the
default hardware context the threaded hardirq context, which preserves
the old locking rules.

The wait-type specific locking selftests will have a non-threaded
HARDIRQ variant.
