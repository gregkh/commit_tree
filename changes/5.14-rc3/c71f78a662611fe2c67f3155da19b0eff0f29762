ASoC: rt5631: Fix regcache sync errors on resume

The ALC5631 does not like multi-write accesses, avoid them. This fixes:

rt5631 4-001a: Unable to sync registers 0x3a-0x3c. -121

errors on resume from suspend (and all registers after the registers in
the error not being synced).

Inspired by commit 2d30e9494f1e ("ASoC: rt5651: Fix regcache sync errors
on resume") from Hans de Geode, which fixed the same errors on ALC5651.
