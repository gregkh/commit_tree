igc: Refactor igc_clean_rx_ring()

Refactor igc_clean_rx_ring() helper, preparing the code for AF_XDP
zero-copy support which is added by upcoming patches.

The refactor consists of encapsulating page-shared specific code into
its own helper, leaving common code that will be shared by both
page-shared and xsk pool in igc_clean_rx_ring().
