bitmap: Make bitmap_remap() and bitmap_bitremap() available to users

Currently the bitmap_remap() and bitmap_bitremap() are available
only for CONFIG_NUMA=y case, while some users may benefit out of it
and being independent to NUMA code. Make them available to users
by moving out of ifdeffery and exporting for modules.
