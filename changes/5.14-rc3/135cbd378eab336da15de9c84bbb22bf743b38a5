spi: imx: mx51-ecspi: Reinstate low-speed CONFIGREG delay

Since 00b80ac935539 ("spi: imx: mx51-ecspi: Move some initialisation to
prepare_message hook."), the MX51_ECSPI_CONFIG write no longer happens
in prepare_transfer hook, but rather in prepare_message hook, however
the MX51_ECSPI_CONFIG delay is still left in prepare_transfer hook and
thus has no effect. This leads to low bus frequency operation problems
described in 6fd8b8503a0dc ("spi: spi-imx: Fix out-of-order CS/SCLK
operation at low speeds") again.

Move the MX51_ECSPI_CONFIG write delay into the prepare_message hook
as well, thus reinstating the low bus frequency fix.

Fixes: 00b80ac935539 ("spi: imx: mx51-ecspi: Move some initialisation to prepare_message hook.")
