bpf: Selftest to verify mixing bpf2bpf calls and tailcalls with insn patch

This adds some extra noise to the tailcall_bpf2bpf4 tests that will cause
verify to patch insns. This then moves around subprog start/end insn
index and poke descriptor insn index to ensure that verify and JIT will
continue to track these correctly.

If done correctly verifier should pass this program same as before and
JIT should emit tail call logic.
