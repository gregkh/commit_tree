ipv4: Calculate multipath hash inside switch statement

A subsequent patch will add another multipath hash policy where the
multipath hash is calculated directly by the policy specific code and
not outside of the switch statement.

Prepare for this change by moving the multipath hash calculation inside
the switch statement.

No functional changes intended.
