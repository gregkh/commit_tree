dt-bindings: clock: Convert ti,sci-clk to json schema

Convert the ti,sci-clk to json schema for better checks and documentation.

Differences being:
 - Drop consumer example as they are documented in the corresponding
   bindings themselves.
 - Standardize the node name as clock-controller rather than clocks as
   it is more appropriate.
 - Drop phandle description for clock-cells as it is redundant.
