mm, memcg: mark cgroup_memory_nosocket, nokmem and noswap as __ro_after_init

cgroup_memory_nosocket, cgroup_memory_nokmem and cgroup_memory_noswap
are initialized during the kernel initialization and never change
their value afterwards.

cgroup_memory_nosocket, cgroup_memory_nokmem are written only from
cgroup_memory(), which is marked as __init.

cgroup_memory_noswap is written from setup_swap_account() and
mem_cgroup_swap_init(), both are marked as __init.

Mark all three variables as __ro_after_init.
