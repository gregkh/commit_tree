KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: inline kvmhv_load_hv_regs_and_go into __kvmhv_vcpu_entry_p9

Now the initial C implementation is done, inline more HV code to make
rearranging things easier.

And rename __kvmhv_vcpu_entry_p9 to drop the leading underscores as it's
now C, and is now a more complete vcpu entry.
