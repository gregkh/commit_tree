ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Fix data_mutex lock

The private->vol_updated flag was being checked outside of the
mutex_lock/unlock() of private->data_mutex leading to the volume data
being fetched twice from the device unnecessarily or old volume data
being returned.

Update scarlett2_*_ctl_get() and include the private->vol_updated flag
check inside the critical region.
