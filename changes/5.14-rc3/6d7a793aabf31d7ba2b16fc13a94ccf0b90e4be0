drm/i915/display: Allow fastsets when DP_SDP_VSC infoframe do not match with PSR enabled

When PSR is enabled it handles DP_SDP_VSC, changing revision and all
the other fields as necessary.
It can also enabled and disable this SDP as needed without a full
modeset.

So here masking DP_SDP_VSC bit when previous and future state PSR
enabled, it will still be checked when comparing the asked state
to what was programmed to hardware.
