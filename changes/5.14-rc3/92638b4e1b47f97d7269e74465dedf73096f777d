mm: arch: remove indirection level in alloc_zeroed_user_highpage_movable()

In an upcoming change we would like to add a flag to
GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE so that it would no longer be an OR
of GFP_HIGHUSER and __GFP_MOVABLE. This poses a problem for
alloc_zeroed_user_highpage_movable() which passes __GFP_MOVABLE
into an arch-specific __alloc_zeroed_user_highpage() hook which ORs
in GFP_HIGHUSER.

Since __alloc_zeroed_user_highpage() is only ever called from
alloc_zeroed_user_highpage_movable(), we can remove one level
of indirection here. Remove __alloc_zeroed_user_highpage(),
make alloc_zeroed_user_highpage_movable() the hook, and use
GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE in the hook implementations so that they will
pick up the new flag that we are going to add.
