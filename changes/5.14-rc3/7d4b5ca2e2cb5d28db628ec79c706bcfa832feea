cxl/acpi: Add downstream port data to cxl_port instances

In preparation for infrastructure that enumerates and configures the CXL
decode mechanism of an upstream port to its downstream ports, add a
representation of a CXL downstream port.

On ACPI systems the top-most logical downstream ports in the hierarchy
are the host bridges (ACPI0016 devices) that decode the memory windows
described by the CXL Early Discovery Table Fixed Memory Window
Structures (CEDT.CFMWS).
