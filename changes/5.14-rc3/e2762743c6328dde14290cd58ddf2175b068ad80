KVM: PPC: Book3S 64: Minimise hcall handler calling convention differences

This sets up the same calling convention from interrupt entry to
KVM interrupt handler for system calls as exists for other interrupt
types.

This is a better API, it uses a save area rather than SPR, and it has
more registers free to use. Using a single common API helps maintain
it, and it becomes easier to use in C in a later patch.
