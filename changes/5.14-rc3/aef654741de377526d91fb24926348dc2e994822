dt-bindings: clk: emev2: Convert to json-schema

Convert the Renesas EMMA Mobile EV2 System Management Unit (SMU) Device
Tree binding documentation to json-schema.

Drop the separate provider examples, as they mostly duplicate the global
example.  Drop the consumer example, as it doesn't belong here.
Update the global example to match reality.
