net: bridge: mcast: prepare mdb netlink for mcast router split

In preparation for the upcoming split of multicast router state into
their IPv4 and IPv6 variants and to avoid IPv6 #ifdef clutter later add
some inline functions for the protocol specific parts in the mdb router
netlink code. Also the we need iterate over the port instead of router
list to be able put one router port entry with both the IPv4 and IPv6
multicast router info later.
