drivers/perf: hisi: Fix data source control

'Data source' is a new function for HHA PMU and config / clear
interface was wrong by mistake. 'HHA_DATSRC_CTRL' register is
mainly used for data source configuration, if we enable bit0
as driver, it will go on count the event and we didn't check
it carefully. So fix the issue and do as the initial purpose.
