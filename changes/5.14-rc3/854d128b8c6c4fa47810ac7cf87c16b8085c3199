soc/tegra: fuse: Don't return -ENOMEM when allocate lookups failed

fuse->base can not be unmapped if allocate lookups failed in
tegra_init_fuse(), because it is an early_initcall, the driver
will be loaded anyway and fuse->base will be accessed by other
functions later, so remove the return -ENOMEM after allocating
lookups failed to make less confusing.
