scsi: mpi3mr: Add support for queue command processing

Send Port Enable Request to FW for Device Discovery.  As part of port
enable completion driver calls scan_start and scan_finished hooks.  SCSI
layer references like sdev, starget, etc. are added but actual device
discovery will be supported once driver adds complete event process
handling.
