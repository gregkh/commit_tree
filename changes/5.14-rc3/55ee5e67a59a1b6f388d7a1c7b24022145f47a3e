iommu/vt-d: Add common code for dmar latency performance monitors

The execution time of some operations is very performance critical, such
as cache invalidation and PRQ processing time. This adds some common code
to monitor the execution time range of those operations. The interfaces
include enabling/disabling, checking status, updating sampling data and
providing a common string format for users.
