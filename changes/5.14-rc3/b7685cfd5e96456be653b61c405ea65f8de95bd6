KVM: nVMX: Force enlightened VMCS sync from nested_vmx_failValid()

'need_vmcs12_to_shadow_sync' is used for both shadow and enlightened
VMCS sync when we exit to L1. The comment in nested_vmx_failValid()
validly states why shadow vmcs sync can be omitted but this doesn't
apply to enlightened VMCS as it 'shadows' all VMCS12 fields.
