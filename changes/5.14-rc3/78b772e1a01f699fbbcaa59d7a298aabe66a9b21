drm/i915/display: Fill PSR state during hardware configuration read out

So far if we had a mismatch between the state asked and what was
programmed in hardware for PSR, this mismatch would go unnoticed.

So here adding the PSR to the hardware configuration readout,
EDP_PSR_CTL and EDP_PSR2_CTL can't be directly read because its state
flips due to other factors like frontbuffer modifications and CRC.
