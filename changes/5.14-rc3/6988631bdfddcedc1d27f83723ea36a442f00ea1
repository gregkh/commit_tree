locking/atomic: cmpxchg: make `generic` a prefix

The asm-generic implementations of cmpxchg_local() and cmpxchg64_local()
use a `_generic` suffix to distinguish themselves from arch code or
wrappers used elsewhere.

Subsequent patches will add ARCH_ATOMIC support to these
implementations, and will distinguish more functions with a `generic`
portion. To align with how ARCH_ATOMIC uses an `arch_` prefix, it would
be helpful to use a `generic_` prefix rather than a `_generic` suffix.

In preparation for this, this patch renames the existing functions to
make `generic` a prefix rather than a suffix. There should be no
functional change as a result of this patch.
