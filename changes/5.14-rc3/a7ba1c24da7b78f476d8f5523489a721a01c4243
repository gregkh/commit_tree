iio: accel: bma180/bmc150: Move BMA254 to bmc150-accel driver

Commit c1d1c4a62db5 ("iio: accel: bma180: BMA254 support") added
BMA254 support to the bma180 driver and changed some naming to BMA25x
to make it easier to add support for BMA253 and BMA255.

Unfortunately, there is quite some overlap between the bma180 driver
and the bmc150-accel driver. Back when the commit was made, the
bmc150-accel driver actually already had support for BMA255, and
adding support for BMA254 would have been as simple as adding a new
compatible to bmc150-accel.

The bmc150-accel driver is a bit better for BMA254 since it also
supports the motion trigger/interrupt functionality. Fortunately,
moving BMA254 support over to bmc150-accel is fairly simple because
the drivers have compatible device tree bindings.

Revert most of the changes for BMA254 support in bma180 and move
BMA254 over to bmc150-accel. This has the following advantages:

  - Support for motion trigger/interrupt
  - Fix incorrect scale values (BMA254 currently uses the same as
    BMA250 but actually they're different because of 10 vs 12 bits
    data size)
  - Less code than before :)

BMA250 could be potentially also moved but it's more complicated
because its chip_id conflicts with the one for BMA222 in bmc150-accel.
Perhaps there are also other register differences, I did not investigate
further yet (and I have no way to test it).
