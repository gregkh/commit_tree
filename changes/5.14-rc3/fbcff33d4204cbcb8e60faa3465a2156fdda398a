cifs: Avoid field over-reading memcpy()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally reading across neighboring fields.

Instead of using memcpy to read across multiple struct members, just
perform per-member assignments as already done for other members.
