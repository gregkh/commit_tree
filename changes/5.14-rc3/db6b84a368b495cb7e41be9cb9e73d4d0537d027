riscv: Make sure the kernel mapping does not overlap with IS_ERR_VALUE

The check that is done in setup_bootmem currently only works for 32-bit
kernel since the kernel mapping has been moved outside of the linear
mapping for 64-bit kernel. So make sure that for 64-bit kernel, the kernel
mapping does not overlap with the last 4K of the addressable memory.
