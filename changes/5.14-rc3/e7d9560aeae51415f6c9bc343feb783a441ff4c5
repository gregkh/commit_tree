Revert "drm/amd/display: Fix overlay validation by considering cursors"

This reverts commit 33f409e60eb0c59a4d0d06a62ab4642a988e17f7.

The patch that we are reverting here was originally applied because it
fixes multiple IGT issues and flickering in Android. However, after a
discussion with Sean Paul and Mark, it looks like that this patch might
cause problems on ChromeOS. For this reason, we decided to revert this
patch.
