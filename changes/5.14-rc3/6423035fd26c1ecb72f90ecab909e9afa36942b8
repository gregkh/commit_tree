cxl/hdm: Fix decoder count calculation

The decoder count in the HDM decoder capability structure is an encoded
field. As defined in the spec:

Decoder Count: Reports the number of memory address decoders implemented
by the component.
0 – 1 Decoder
1 – 2 Decoders
2 – 4 Decoders
3 – 6 Decoders
4 – 8 Decoders
5 – 10 Decoders
All other values are reserved

Nothing is actually fixed by this as nothing actually used this mapping
yet.
