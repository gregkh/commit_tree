netfilter: nft_exthdr: Support SCTP chunks

Chunks are SCTP header extensions similar in implementation to IPv6
extension headers or TCP options. Reusing exthdr expression to find and
extract field values from them is therefore pretty straightforward.

For now, this supports extracting data from chunks at a fixed offset
(and length) only - chunks themselves are an extensible data structure;
in order to make all fields available, a nested extension search is
needed.
