drm/panel: panel-simple: Add missing pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() calls

The PM Runtime docs specifically call out the need to call
pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() in the remove() callback if
pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() was called in probe():

> Drivers in ->remove() callback should undo the runtime PM changes done
> in ->probe(). Usually this means calling pm_runtime_disable(),
> pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() etc.

We should do this. This fixes a warning splat that I saw when I was
testing out the panel-simple's remove().
