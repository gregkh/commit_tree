ARM: dts: am33xx-clocks: add spread spectrum support

Registers for adjusting the spread spectrum clocking (SSC) have been
added. As reported by the TI spruh73x RM, SSC is supported only for LCD
and MPU PLLs, but the CM_SSC_DELTAMSTEP_DPLL_XXX and
CM_SSC_MODFREQDIV_DPLL_XXX registers, as well as the enable field in the
CM_CLKMODE_DPLL_XXX registers are mapped for all PLLs (CORE, MPU, DDR,
PER, DISP).
