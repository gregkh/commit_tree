drm/i915/display: Replace intel_psr_enabled() calls by intel_crtc_state check

All of this places don't need to intel_psr_enabled() that will lock
psr mutex, check state and unlock.

Instead it can directly check PSR state in intel_crtc_state, the only
place that was not possible was intel_read_dp_vsc_sdp() but since
"drm/i915/display: Fill PSR state during hardware configuration read
out" it is possible.
