ASoC: q6dsp: Undo buggy warning fix

This reverts commit 5f1b95d08de712327e452d082a50fded435ec884.

The warnings that commit 5f1b95d08de7 ("ASoC: q6dsp: q6afe: remove
unneeded dead-store initialization") was trying to fix were already
fixed in commit 12900bacb4f3 ("ASoC: qcom: q6afe: remove useless
assignments"). With both commits in the tree, port_id is uninitialized,
as pointed out by clang:

sound/soc/qcom/qdsp6/q6afe.c:1213:18: warning: variable 'port_id' is
uninitialized when used here [-Wuninitialized]
        stop->port_id = port_id;
                        ^~~~~~~
sound/soc/qcom/qdsp6/q6afe.c:1186:13: note: initialize the variable
'port_id' to silence this warning
        int port_id;
                   ^
                    = 0
1 warning generated.

Bring back the initialization so that everything works as intended.
