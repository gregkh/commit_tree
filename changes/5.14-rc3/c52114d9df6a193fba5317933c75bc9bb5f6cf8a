lib/test_hmm: remove set but unused page variable

The HMM selftests use atomic_check_access() to check atomic access to a
page has been revoked.  It doesn't matter if the page mapping has been
removed from the mirrored page tables as that also implies atomic access
has been revoked.  Therefore remove the unused page variable to fix this
compiler warning:

  lib/test_hmm.c:631:16: warning: variable `page' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
