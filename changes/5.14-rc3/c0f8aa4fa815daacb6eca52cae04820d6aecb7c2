mm: define default MAX_PTRS_PER_* in include/pgtable.h

Commit c65e774fb3f6 ("x86/mm: Make PGDIR_SHIFT and PTRS_PER_P4D variable")
made PTRS_PER_P4D variable on x86 and introduced MAX_PTRS_PER_P4D as a
constant for cases which need a compile-time constant (e.g.  fixed-size
arrays).

powerpc likewise has boot-time selectable MMU features which can cause
other mm "constants" to vary.  For KASAN, we have some static
PTE/PMD/PUD/P4D arrays so we need compile-time maximums for all these
constants.  Extend the MAX_PTRS_PER_ idiom, and place default definitions
in include/pgtable.h.  These define MAX_PTRS_PER_x to be PTRS_PER_x unless
an architecture has defined MAX_PTRS_PER_x in its arch headers.

Clean up pgtable-nop4d.h and s390's MAX_PTRS_PER_P4D definitions while
we're at it: both can just pick up the default now.
