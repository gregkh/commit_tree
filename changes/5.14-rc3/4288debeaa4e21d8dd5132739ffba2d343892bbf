usb: typec: tcpci: Fix up sink disconnect thresholds for PD

"Table 4-3 VBUS Sink Characteristics" of "Type-C Cable and Connector
Specification" defines the disconnect voltage thresholds of various
configurations. This change fixes the disconnect threshold voltage
calculation based on vSinkPD_min and vSinkDisconnectPD as defined
by the table.
