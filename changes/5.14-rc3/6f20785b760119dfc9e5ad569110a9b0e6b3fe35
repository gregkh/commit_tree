drm/i915/display: fix typo when returning table

Fix table returned when port_clock > 270000:

	drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_ddi_buf_trans.c:752:47: error: variable 'adlp_dkl_phy_dp_ddi_trans_hbr2_hbr3' is not needed and will not be emitted [-Werror,-Wunneeded-internal-declaration]

Initial version of the patch had it in a single table, but on second
version the table got split, but we continued to reference just one of
them.
