drm/i915: Don't zero out the Y plane's watermarks

Don't zero out the watermarks for the Y plane since we've already
computed them when computing the UV plane's watermarks (since the
UV plane always appears before ethe Y plane when iterating through
the planes).

This leads to allocating no DDB for the Y plane since .min_ddb_alloc
also gets zeroed. And that of course leads to underruns when scanning
out planar formats.
