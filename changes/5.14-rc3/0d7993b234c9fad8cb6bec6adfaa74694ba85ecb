spi: spi-sun6i: Fix chipselect/clock bug

The current sun6i SPI implementation initializes the transfer too early,
resulting in SCK going high before the transfer. When using an additional
(gpio) chipselect with sun6i, the chipselect is asserted at a time when
clock is high, making the SPI transfer fail.

This is due to SUN6I_GBL_CTL_BUS_ENABLE being written into
SUN6I_GBL_CTL_REG at an early stage. Moving that to the transfer
function, hence, right before the transfer starts, mitigates that
problem.
