eeprom: ee1004: Improve creating dummy devices

i2c_new_dummy_device() calls i2c_new_client_device() that complains
if it fails to create the device. Therefore we don't have to emit an
error message in case of failure. In addition ensure that
ee1004_set_page is only set if creating the device succeeded.
