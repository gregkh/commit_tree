btrfs: introduce try-lock semantics for exclusive op start

Add try-lock for exclusive operation start to allow callers to do more
checks. The same operation must already be running. The try-lock and
unlock must pair and are a substitute for btrfs_exclop_start, thus it
must also pair with btrfs_exclop_finish to release the exclop context.
