Drivers: hv: Move Hyper-V extended capability check to arch neutral code

The extended capability query code is currently under arch/x86, but it
is architecture neutral, and is used by arch neutral code in the Hyper-V
balloon driver. Hence the balloon driver fails to build on other
architectures.

Fix by moving the ext cap code out from arch/x86.  Because it is also
called from built-in architecture specific code, it can't be in a module,
so the Makefile treats as built-in even when CONFIG_HYPERV is "m".  Also
drivers/Makefile is tweaked because this is the first occurrence of a
Hyper-V file that is built-in even when CONFIG_HYPERV is "m".

While here, update the hypercall status check to use the new helper
function instead of open coding. No functional change.
