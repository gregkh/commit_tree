platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Ignore VPC event bit 10

VPC event bit 10 gets set on a Yoga 300-11IBR when the EC believes that the
device has changed between laptop/tent/stand/tablet mode.

The EC relies on getting angle info from 2 accelerometers through a special
windows service calling a DSM on the DUAL250E ACPI-device. Linux does not
do this, making the laptop/tent/stand/tablet mode info unreliable.

Ignore VPC event bit 10 to avoid the warnings triggered by the default case
in ideapad_acpi_notify().

Note that the plan for Linux is to have iio-sensor-proxy read the 2
accelerometers and have it provide info about which mode 360Â° hinges
2-in-1s to the rest of userspace:
