KVM: arm64: Remove hyp_pool pointer from struct hyp_page

Each struct hyp_page currently contains a pointer to a hyp_pool struct
where the page should be freed if its refcount reaches 0. However, this
information can always be inferred from the context in the EL2 code, so
drop the pointer to save a few bytes in the vmemmap.
