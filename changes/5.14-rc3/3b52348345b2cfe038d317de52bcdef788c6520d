lib/decompressors: remove set but not used variabled 'level'

Fixes gcc '-Wunused-but-set-variable' warning:

lib/decompress_unlzo.c:46:5: warning: variable `level' set but
not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

It is never used and so can be removed.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: warning: value computed is not used]
