xdp: Move the rxq_info.mem clearing to unreg_mem_model()

xdp_rxq_info_unreg() implicitly calls xdp_rxq_info_unreg_mem_model().
This may well be confusing to the driver authors, and lead to double free
if they call xdp_rxq_info_unreg_mem_model() before xdp_rxq_info_unreg()
(when mem model type == MEM_TYPE_PAGE_POOL).

In fact error path of mvpp2_rxq_init() seems to currently do exactly that.

The double free will result in refcount underflow in page_pool_destroy().
Make the interface a little more programmer friendly by clearing type and
id so that xdp_rxq_info_unreg_mem_model() can be called multiple times.
