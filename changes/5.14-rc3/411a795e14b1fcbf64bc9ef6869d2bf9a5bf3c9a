net: qualcomm: rmnet: drop some unary NOTs

We compare a payload checksum with a pseudo checksum value for
equality in rmnet_map_ipv4_dl_csum_trailer().  Both of those values
are computed with a unary NOT (~) operation.  The result of the
comparison is the same if we omit that NOT for both values.

Remove these operations in rmnet_map_ipv6_dl_csum_trailer() also.
