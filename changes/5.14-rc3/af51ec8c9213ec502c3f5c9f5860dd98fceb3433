iio: hid: trigger: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

The call to pm_runtime_put_noidle() in remove() callback is not
balanced by any gets

Note this doesn't cause any problems beyond reader confusion as the runtime
pm core protects against the reference counter going negative.

Whilst here, use pm_runtiem_resume_and_get() to simplify code a little.
