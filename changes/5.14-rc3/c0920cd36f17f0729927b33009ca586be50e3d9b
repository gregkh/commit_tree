scsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Set no linger

Userspace (open-iscsi based tools at least) sets no linger on the socket to
prevent stale data from being sent. However, with the in-kernel cleanup if
userspace is not up the sockfd_put will release the socket without having
set that sockopt.

iscsid sets that opt at socket close time, but it seems ok to set this at
setup time in the kernel for all tools.
