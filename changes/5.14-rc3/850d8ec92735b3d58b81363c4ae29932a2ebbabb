ARM: configs: Update Versatile defconfig

This updates the Versatile defconfig for the changes
in the v5.14-rc1 kernel:

- The Framebuffer CONFIG_FB needs to be explicitly selected
  or we don't get any framebuffer anymore. DRM has stopped to
  select FB because of circular dependency.
- The CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS are not needed when using DRM
  framebuffer emulation as DRM does.
- The Acorn fonts are removed, the default framebuffer font
  works fine. I don't know why this was selected in the first
  place or how the Kconfig was altered so it was removed.

Fixes: f611b1e7624c ("drm: Avoid circular dependencies for CONFIG_FB")
