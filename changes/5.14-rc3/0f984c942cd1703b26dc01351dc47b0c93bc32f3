drm/amd/display: Line Buffer changes

DCN 3x increased Line buffer size for DCHUB latency hiding, from 4 lines
of 4K resolution lines to 5 lines of 4K resolution lines. All Line
Buffer can be used as extended memory for P State change latency hiding.
The maximum number of lines is increased to 32 lines. Finally,
LB_MEMORY_CONFIG_1 (LB memory piece 1) and LB_MEMORY _CONFIG_2 (LB
memory piece 2) are not affected, no change in size, only 3 pieces is
affected, i.e., when all 3 pieces are used in both LB_MEMORY_CONFIG_0
and LB_MEMORY_CONFIG_3 (for 4:2:0) modes.
