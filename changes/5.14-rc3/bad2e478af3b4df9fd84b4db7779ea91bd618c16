selftests/bpf: Turn on libbpf 1.0 mode and fix all IS_ERR checks

Turn ony libbpf 1.0 mode. Fix all the explicit IS_ERR checks that now will be
broken because libbpf returns NULL on error (and sets errno). Fix
ASSERT_OK_PTR and ASSERT_ERR_PTR to work for both old mode and new modes and
use them throughout selftests. This is trivial to do by using
libbpf_get_error() API that all libbpf users are supposed to use, instead of
IS_ERR checks.

A bunch of checks also did explicit -1 comparison for various fd-returning
APIs. Such checks are replaced with >= 0 or < 0 cases.

There were also few misuses of bpf_object__find_map_by_name() in test_maps.
Those are fixed in this patch as well.
