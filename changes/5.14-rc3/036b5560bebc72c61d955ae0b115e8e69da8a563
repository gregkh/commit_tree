powerpc/inst: Avoid pointer dereferencing in ppc_inst_equal()

Avoid casting/dereferencing ppc_inst() as u64* , check each member
of the struct when relevant.

And remove the 0xff initialisation of the suffix for non
prefixed instruction. An instruction with 0xff as a suffix
might be invalid, but still is a prefixed instruction and
has to be considered as this.
