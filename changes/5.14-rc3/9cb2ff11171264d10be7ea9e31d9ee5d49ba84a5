spi: cadence-quadspi: Disable Auto-HW polling

cadence-quadspi has a builtin Auto-HW polling funtionality using which
it keep tracks of completion of write operations. When Auto-HW polling
is enabled, it automatically initiates status register read operation,
until the flash clears its busy bit.

cadence-quadspi controller doesn't allow an address phase when
auto-polling the busy bit on the status register. Unlike SPI NOR
flashes, SPI NAND flashes do require the address of status register
when polling the busy bit using the read register operation. As
Auto-HW polling is enabled by default, cadence-quadspi returns a
timeout for every write operation after an indefinite amount of
polling on SPI NAND flashes.

Disable Auto-HW polling completely as the spi-nor core, spinand core,
etc. take care of polling the busy bit on their own.
