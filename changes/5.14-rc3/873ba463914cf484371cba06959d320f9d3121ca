arm64: decouple check whether pfn is in linear map from pfn_valid()

The intended semantics of pfn_valid() is to verify whether there is a
struct page for the pfn in question and nothing else.

Yet, on arm64 it is used to distinguish memory areas that are mapped in
the linear map vs those that require ioremap() to access them.

Introduce a dedicated pfn_is_map_memory() wrapper for
memblock_is_map_memory() to perform such check and use it where
appropriate.

Using a wrapper allows to avoid cyclic include dependencies.

While here also update style of pfn_valid() so that both pfn_valid() and
pfn_is_map_memory() declarations will be consistent.
