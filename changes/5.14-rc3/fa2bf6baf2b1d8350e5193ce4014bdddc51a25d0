octeontx2-af: Enable transmit side LBK link

For enabling VF-VF switching the packets egressing
out of CGX mapped VFs needed to be sent to LBK
so that same packets are received back to the system.
But the LBK link also needs to be enabled in addition
to a VF's mapped CGX_LMAC link otherwise hardware
raises send error interrupt indicating selected LBK
link is not enabled in NIX_AF_TL3_TL2X_LINKX_CFG register.
Hence this patch enables all LBK links in
TL3_TL2_LINKX_CFG registers.
Also to enable packet flow between PFs/VFs of NIX0
to PFs/VFs of NIX1(in 98xx silicon) the NPC TX DMAC
rules has to be installed such that rules must be hit
for any TX interface i.e., NIX0-TX or NIX1-TX provided
DMAC match creteria is met. Hence this patch changes the
behavior such that MCAM is programmed to match with any
NIX0/1-TX interface for TX rules.
