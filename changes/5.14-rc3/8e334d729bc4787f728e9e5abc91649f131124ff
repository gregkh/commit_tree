arm64: smp: unify task and sp setup

Once we enable the MMU, we have to initialize:

* SP_EL0 to point at the active task
* SP to point at the active task's stack
* SCS_SP to point at the active task's shadow stack

For all tasks (including init_task), this information can be derived
from the task's task_struct.

Let's unify __primary_switched and __secondary_switched to consistently
acquire this information from the relevant task_struct. At the same
time, let's fold this together with initializing a task's final frame.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
