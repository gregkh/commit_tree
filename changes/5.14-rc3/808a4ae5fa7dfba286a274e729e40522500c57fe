vgaarb: Use ACPI HID name to find integrated GPU

Commit 3d42f1ddc47a ("vgaarb: Keep adding VGA device in queue") assumes
the first device is an integrated GPU. However, on AMD platforms an
integrated GPU can have higher PCI device number than a discrete GPU.

Integrated GPU on ACPI platform generally has _DOD and _DOS method, so
use that as predicate to find integrated GPU. If the new strategy
doesn't work, fallback to use the first device as boot VGA.
