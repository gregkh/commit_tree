KVM: hyper-v: Collect hypercall params into struct

As of now there are 7 parameters (and flags) that are used in various
hyper-v hypercall handlers. There are 6 more input/output parameters
passed from XMM registers which are to be added in an upcoming patch.

To make passing arguments to the handlers more readable, capture all
these parameters into a single structure.
