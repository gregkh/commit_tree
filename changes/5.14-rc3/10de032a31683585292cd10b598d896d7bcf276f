mt76: mt7921: add back connection monitor support

Hw beacon cmd to the mt7921 firmware doesn't only filter out the beacon,
but also performs its own connection monitoring, including periodic
keep-alives to the AP and probing the AP on beacon loss. Will indicate
the host with the event when the firmware detects the connection is lost.
