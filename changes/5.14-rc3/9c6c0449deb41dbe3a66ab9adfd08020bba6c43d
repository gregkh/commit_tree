bpftool: Set errno on skeleton failures and propagate errors

Follow libbpf's error handling conventions and pass through errors and errno
properly. Skeleton code always returned NULL on errors (not ERR_PTR(err)), so
there are no backwards compatibility concerns. But now we also set errno
properly, so it's possible to distinguish different reasons for failure, if
necessary.
