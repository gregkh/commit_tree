ARM: shmobile: defconfig: Restore graphical consoles

As of commit f611b1e7624ccdbd ("drm: Avoid circular dependencies for
CONFIG_FB"), CONFIG_FB is no longer auto-enabled.  While CONFIG_FB may
be considered unneeded for systems where graphics is provided by a DRM
driver, R-Mobile A1 still relies on a frame buffer device driver for
graphics support.

Restore support for graphics on R-Mobile A1 and graphical consoles on
DRM-based systems by explicitly enabling CONFIG_FB in the defconfig for
Renesas ARM systems.
