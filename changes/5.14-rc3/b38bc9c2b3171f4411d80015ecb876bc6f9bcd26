fs: dlm: fix srcu read lock usage

This patch holds the srcu connection read lock in cases where we lookup
the connections and accessing it. We don't hold the srcu lock in workers
function where the scheduled worker is part of the connection itself.
The connection should not be freed if any worker is scheduled or
pending.
