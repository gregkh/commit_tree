i2c: core: Add stub for i2c_verify_client() if !CONFIG_I2C

If I2C is not compiled, there is no way we should see a call to
i2c_verify_client() on a device that is an i2c client. As such,
provide a stub to return NULL to resolve an associated build failure.

The build is failing with this link error
ld: fxls8962af-core.o: in function `fxls8962af_fifo_transfer':
fxls8962af-core.c: undefined reference to `i2c_verify_client'
