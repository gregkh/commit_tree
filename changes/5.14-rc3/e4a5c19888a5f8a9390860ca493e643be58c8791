spi: stm32h7: fix full duplex irq handler handling

In case of Full-Duplex mode, DXP flag is set when RXP and TXP flags are
set. But to avoid 2 different handlings, just add TXP and RXP flag in
the mask instead of DXP, and then keep the initial handling of TXP and
RXP events.
Also rephrase comment about EOTIE which is one of the interrupt enable
bits. It is not triggered by any event.
