perf/x86/intel/uncore: Generalize I/O stacks to PMON mapping procedure

Currently I/O stacks to IIO PMON mapping is available on Skylake servers
only and need to make code more general to easily enable further platforms.
So, introduce get_topology() callback in struct intel_uncore_type which
allows to move common code to separate function and make mapping procedure
more general.
