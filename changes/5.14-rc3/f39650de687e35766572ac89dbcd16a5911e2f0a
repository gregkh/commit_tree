kernel.h: split out panic and oops helpers

kernel.h is being used as a dump for all kinds of stuff for a long time.
Here is the attempt to start cleaning it up by splitting out panic and
oops helpers.

There are several purposes of doing this:
- dropping dependency in bug.h
- dropping a loop by moving out panic_notifier.h
- unload kernel.h from something which has its own domain

At the same time convert users tree-wide to use new headers, although for
the time being include new header back to kernel.h to avoid twisted
indirected includes for existing users.
