memblock: ensure there is no overflow in memblock_overlaps_region()

There maybe an overflow in memblock_overlaps_region() if it is called with
base and size such that

	base + size > PHYS_ADDR_MAX

Make sure that memblock_overlaps_region() caps the size to prevent such
overflow and remove now duplicated call to memblock_cap_size() from
memblock_is_region_reserved().
