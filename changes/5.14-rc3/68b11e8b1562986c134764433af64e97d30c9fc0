io_uring: explicitly count entries for poll reqs

If __io_queue_proc() fails to add a second poll entry, e.g. kmalloc()
failed, but it goes on with a third waitqueue, it may succeed and
overwrite the error status. Count the number of poll entries we added,
so we can set pt->error to zero at the beginning and find out when the
mentioned scenario happens.
