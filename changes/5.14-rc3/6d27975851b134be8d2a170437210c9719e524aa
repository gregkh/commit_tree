ACPI: scan: Rearrange dep_unmet initialization

The dep_unmet field in struct acpi_device is used to store the
number of unresolved _DEP dependencies (that is, operation region
dependencies for which there are no drivers present) for the ACPI
device object represented by it.

That field is initialized to 1 for all ACPI device objects in
acpi_add_single_object(), via acpi_init_device_object(), so as to
avoid evaluating _STA prematurely for battery device objects in
acpi_scan_init_status(), and it is "fixed up" in acpi_bus_check_add()
after the acpi_add_single_object() called by it has returned.

This is not particularly straightforward and causes dep_unmet to
remain 1 for device objects without dependencies created by invoking
acpi_add_single_object() directly, outside acpi_bus_check_add().

For this reason, rearrange acpi_add_single_object() to initialize
dep_unmet completely before calling acpi_scan_init_status(), which
requires passing one extra bool argument to it, and update all of
its callers accordingly.
