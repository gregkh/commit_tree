riscv: __asm_copy_to-from_user: Fix: fail on RV32

Had a bug when converting bytes to bits when the cpu was rv32.

The a3 contains the number of bytes and multiple of 8
would be the bits. The LGREG is holding 2 for RV32 and 3 for
RV32, so to achieve multiple of 8 it must always be constant 3.
The 2 was mistakenly used for rv32.
