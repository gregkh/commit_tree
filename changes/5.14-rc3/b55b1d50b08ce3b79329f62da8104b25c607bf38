net: stmmac: fix NPD with phylink_set_pcs if there is no MDIO bus

priv->plat->mdio_bus_data is optional, some platforms may not set it,
however we proceed to look straight at priv->plat->mdio_bus_data->has_xpcs.

Since the xpcs is instantiated based on the has_xpcs property, we can
avoid looking at the priv->plat->mdio_bus_data structure altogether and
just check for the presence of the xpcs pointer.
