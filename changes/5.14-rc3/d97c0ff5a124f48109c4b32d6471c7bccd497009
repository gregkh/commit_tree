extcon: sm5502: Add support for SM5504

SM5504 is another MUIC from Silicon Mitus that is fairly similar
to SM5502. They seem to use the same register set, but:

  - SM5504 has some additional bits in SM5502_REG_CONTROL
  - SM5504 has a quite different set of interrupts
  - SM5504 reports USB OTG as dev_type1 = BIT(0) instead of BIT(7)

Overall it's minor and we can support this by defining a separate
struct sm5502_type for SM5504.
