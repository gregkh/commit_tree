bnxt_en: Fix PTP capability discovery

The current PTP initialization logic does not account for firmware
reset that may cause PTP capability to change.  The valid pointer
bp->ptp_cfg is used to indicate that the device is capable of PTP
and that it has been initialized.  So we must clean up bp->ptp_cfg
and free it if the firmware after reset does not support PTP.
