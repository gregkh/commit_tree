dt-bindings: arm: add compatible for Forlinx OKA40i-C and FETA40i-C

The FETA40i-C is a SoM by Forlinx based on the Allwinner R40/A40i SoC.
The OKA40i-C is a carrier/development board by the same company based on
this SoM.

This patch adds compatible strings for these two devices in preparation for
the next patch containing a devicetree for them.
