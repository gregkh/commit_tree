usb: typec: stusb160x: register role switch before interrupt registration

During interrupt registration, attach state is checked. If attached,
then the Type-C state is updated with typec_set_xxx functions and role
switch is set with usb_role_switch_set_role().

If the usb_role_switch parameter is error or null, the function simply
returns 0.

So, to update usb_role_switch role if a device is attached before the
irq is registered, usb_role_switch must be registered before irq
registration.
