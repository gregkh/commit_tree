ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Update get_config to do endian conversion

For configuration items with a size of 16, scarlett2_usb_get_config()
was filling *buf with little-endian data. Update it to convert to CPU
endian. This function is not currently used so affects nothing yet;
will be used by the upcoming talkback feature.
