powerpc/32: Interchange r1 and r11 in SYSCALL_ENTRY on booke

To better match non booke version of SYSCALL_ENTRY macro,
interchange r1 and r11 in the booke version.

While at it, in both versions use r1 instead of r11 to save
_NIP and _CCR.

All other uses of r11 will go away in next patch, so don't
bother changing them for now.
