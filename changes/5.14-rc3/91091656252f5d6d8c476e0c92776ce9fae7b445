s390/bpf: Perform r1 range checking before accessing jit->seen_reg[r1]

Currently array jit->seen_reg[r1] is being accessed before the range
checking of index r1. The range changing on r1 should be performed
first since it will avoid any potential out-of-range accesses on the
array seen_reg[] and also it is more optimal to perform checks on r1
before fetching data from the array. Fix this by swapping the order
of the checks before the array access.
