CIFS: Clarify SMB1 code for POSIX delete file

Coverity also complains about the way we calculate the offset
(starting from the address of a 4 byte array within the
header structure rather than from the beginning of the struct
plus 4 bytes) for SMB1 CIFSPOSIXDelFile. This changeset
doesn't change the address but makes it slightly clearer.
