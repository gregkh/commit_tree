staging: rtl8723bs: rtl8723b_hal_init.c: fix build warnings about unused variables

0-day keeps spitting out annoying messages:

drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/hal/rtl8723b_hal_init.c:3895:18: warning: variable 'ra_info2' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/hal/rtl8723b_hal_init.c:3895:8: warning: variable 'ra_info1' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Oddly, it's not catching all of the "set but not used" variables in this
switch statement.  Fix it up just removing the storage of the values
read.  Leave the read from the hardware as odds are it is required in
order to keep it working properly as I do not have the hardware to test
with.

I bet the whole case can be removed, but that will have to wait until
later...
