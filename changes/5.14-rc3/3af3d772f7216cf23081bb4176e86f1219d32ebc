block_dump: remove block_dump feature

We have already delete block_dump feature in mark_inode_dirty() because
it can be replaced by tracepoints, now we also remove the part in
submit_bio() for the same reason. The part of block dump feature in
submit_bio() dump the write process, write region and sectors on the
target disk into kernel message. it can be replaced by
block_bio_queue tracepoint in submit_bio_checks(), so we do not need
block_dump anymore, remove the whole block_dump feature.
