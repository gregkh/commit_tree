media: sti/bdisp: fix pm_runtime_get_sync() usage count

The pm_runtime_get_sync() internally increments the
dev->power.usage_count without decrementing it, even on errors.

The bdisp_start_streaming() doesn't take it into account, which
would unbalance PM usage counter at bdisp_stop_streaming().

The logic at bdisp_probe() is correct, but the best is to use
the same call along the driver.

So, replace it by the new pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), introduced by:
commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
in order to properly decrement the usage counter, avoiding
a potential PM usage counter leak.
