streamline_config.pl: make spacing consistent

Patch series "streamline_config.pl: Fix Perl spacing".

Talking with John Hawley about how vim and emacs deal with Perl files with
respect to tabs and spaces, I found that some of my Perl code in the
kernel had inconsistent spacing.  The way emacs handles Perl by default is
to use 4 spaces per indent, but make all 8 spaces into a single tab.  Vim
does not do this by default.  But if you add the vim variable control:

 # vim: softtabstop=4

to a perl file, it makes vim behave the same way as emacs.

The first patch is to change all 8 spaces into a single tab (mostly from
people editing the file with vim).  The next patch adds the softtabstop
variable to make vim act like emacs by default.

This patch (of 2):

As Perl code tends to have 4 space indentation, but uses tabs for every 8
spaces, make that consistent in the streamline_config.pl code.  Replace
all 8 spaces with a single tab.
