usb: phy: tegra: Correct definition of B_SESS_VLD_WAKEUP_EN bit

The B_SESS_VLD_WAKEUP_EN bit 6 was added by a mistake in a previous
commit. This bit corresponds to B_SESS_END_WAKEUP_EN, which we don't use.
The B_VBUS_VLD_WAKEUP_EN doesn't exist at all and B_SESS_VLD_WAKEUP_EN
needs to be in place of it. We don't utilize B-sensors in the driver,
so it never was a problem, nevertheless let's correct the definition of
the bits.
