mxser: cleanup LSR handling in mxser_receive_chars

mxser_interrupt is a bit confusing as it passes a pointer to LSR
variable ("status") to mxser_receive_chars. That function can indeed
update the LCR variable. Make this clear by not passing a variable by
reference, instead, return updated status. And change its type
accordingly -- to u8.

Note that the next patches will rework ISR so that even the definition
of status will be u8 soon too.
