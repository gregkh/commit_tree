net/mlx5: Removing rmap per IRQ

In next patches, IRQs will be requested according to demand, instead of
statically on driver boot.
Also, currently, rmap is managed by the IRQ layer. rmap management will
move out from the IRQ layer in future patches.

Therefore, we want to remove the IRQ from the rmap, when IRQ is destroyed,
instead of removing all the IRQs from the rmap when irq_table is destroyed.
