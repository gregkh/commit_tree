media: marvel-ccic: fix some issues when getting pm_runtime

Calling pm_runtime_get_sync() is bad, since even when it
returns an error, pm_runtime_put*() should be called.
So, use instead pm_runtime_resume_and_get().

While here, ensure that the error condition will be checked
during clock enable an media open() calls.
