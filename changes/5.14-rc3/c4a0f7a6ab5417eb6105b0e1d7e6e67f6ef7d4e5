usb: dwc2: Skip clock gating on Samsung SoCs

Commit 0112b7ce68ea ("usb: dwc2: Update dwc2_handle_usb_suspend_intr
function.") changed the way the driver handles power down modes in a such
way that it uses clock gating when no other power down mode is available.

This however doesn't work well on the DWC2 implementation used on the
Samsung SoCs. When a clock gating is enabled, system hangs. It looks that
the proper clock gating requires some additional glue code in the shared
USB2 PHY and/or Samsung glue code for the DWC2. To restore driver
operation on the Samsung SoCs simply skip enabling clock gating mode
until one finds what is really needed to make it working reliably.
