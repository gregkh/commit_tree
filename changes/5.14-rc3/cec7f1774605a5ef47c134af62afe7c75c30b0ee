drm/virtio: Fix double free on probe failure

The virtio_gpu_init() will free vgdev and vgdev->vbufs on failure.
But such failure will be caught by virtio_gpu_probe() and then
virtio_gpu_release() will be called to do some cleanup which
will free vgdev and vgdev->vbufs again. So let's set dev->dev_private
to NULL to avoid double free.
