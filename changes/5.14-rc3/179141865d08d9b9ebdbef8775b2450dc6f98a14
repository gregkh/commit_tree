rcuscale: Allow CPU hotplug to be enabled

It is no longer possible to disable CPU hotplug in many configurations,
which means that the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n lines in rcuscale's Kconfig
options are just a source of useless diagnostics.  In addition, rcuscale
doesn't do CPU-hotplug operations in any case.  This commit therefore
changes these lines to read CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y.
