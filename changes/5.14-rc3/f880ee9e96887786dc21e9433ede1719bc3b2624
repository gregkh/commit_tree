soc/tegra: pmc: Add core power domain

NVIDIA Tegra SoCs have multiple power domains, each domain corresponds
to an external SoC power rail. Core power domain covers vast majority of
hardware blocks within a Tegra SoC. The voltage of a power domain should
be set to a level which satisfies all devices within the power domain.
Add support for the core power domain which controls voltage state of the
domain. This allows us to support system-wide DVFS on Tegra20-210 SoCs.
The PMC powergate domains now are sub-domains of the core domain, this
requires device-tree updating, older DTBs are unaffected and will continue
to work as before.
