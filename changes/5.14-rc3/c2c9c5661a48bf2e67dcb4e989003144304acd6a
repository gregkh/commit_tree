clk: agilex/stratix10: add support for the 2nd bypass

The EMAC clocks on Stratix10/Agilex/N5X have an additional bypass that
was not being accounted for. The bypass selects between
emaca_clk/emacb_clk and boot_clk.

Because the bypass register offset is different between Stratix10 and
Agilex/N5X, it's best to create a new function to calculate the bypass.
