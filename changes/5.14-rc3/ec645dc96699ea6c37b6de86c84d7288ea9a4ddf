block: increase BLKCG_MAX_POLS

After mq-deadline learned to deal with cgroups, the BLKCG_MAX_POLS value
became too small for all the elevators to be registered properly. The
following issue is seen:

```
calling  bfq_init+0x0/0x8b @ 1
blkcg_policy_register: BLKCG_MAX_POLS too small
initcall bfq_init+0x0/0x8b returned -28 after 507 usecs
```

which renders BFQ non-functional.

Increase BLKCG_MAX_POLS to allow enough space for everyone.
