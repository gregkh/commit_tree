x86/fpu: Dont restore PKRU in fpregs_restore_userspace()

switch_to() and flush_thread() write the task's PKRU value eagerly so
the PKRU value of current is always valid in the hardware.

That means there is no point in restoring PKRU on exit to user or when
reactivating the task's FPU registers in the signal frame setup path.

This allows to remove all the xstate buffer updates with PKRU values once
the PKRU state is stored in thread struct while a task is scheduled out.
