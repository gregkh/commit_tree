sched/fair: Fix CFS bandwidth hrtimer expiry type

The time remaining until expiry of the refresh_timer can be negative.
Casting the type to an unsigned 64-bit value will cause integer
underflow, making the runtime_refresh_within return false instead of
true. These situations are rare, but they do happen.

This does not cause user-facing issues or errors; other than
possibly unthrottling cfs_rq's using runtime from the previous period(s),
making the CFS bandwidth enforcement less strict in those (special)
situations.
