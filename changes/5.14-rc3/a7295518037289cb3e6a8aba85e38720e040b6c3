ARM: dts: aspeed: ast2600evb: Add dts file for A1 and A0

aspeed-ast2600-evb.dts was modified for supporting A2 evb.

Since A1/A0 evbs don't have GPIO regulators and SD clock frequency
(SCU210) is different to A2 as well. Adding a new dts that removes new
nodes created in aspeed-ast2600-evb.dts is necessary.
