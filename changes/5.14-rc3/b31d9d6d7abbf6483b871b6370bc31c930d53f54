xhci: solve a double free problem while doing s4

when system is doing s4, the process of xhci_resume may be as below:
1、xhci_mem_cleanup
2、xhci_init->xhci_mem_init->xhci_mem_cleanup(when memory is not enough).
xhci_mem_cleanup will be executed twice when system is out of memory.
xhci->port_caps is freed in xhci_mem_cleanup,but it isn't set to NULL.
It will be freed twice when xhci_mem_cleanup is called the second time.

We got following bug when system resumes from s4:

Original patch that caused this issue was backported to 4.4 stable,
so this should be backported to 4.4 stabe as well.
