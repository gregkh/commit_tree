MDIO_MASTER operation have a dedicated busy wait that is not protected
by the mdio mutex. This can cause situation where the MASTER operation
is done and a normal operation is executed between the MASTER read/write
and the MASTER busy_wait. Rework the qca8k_mdio_read/write function to
address this issue by binding the lock for the whole MASTER operation
and not only the mdio read/write common operation.
