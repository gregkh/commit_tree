ALSA: intel8x0: Fix breakage at ac97 clock measurement

The recent workaround for the wild interrupts in commit c1f0616124c4
("ALSA: intel8x0: Don't update period unless prepared") leaded to a
regression, causing the interrupt storm during ac97 clock measurement
at the driver probe.  We need to handle the interrupt while the clock
measurement as well as the proper PCM streams.
