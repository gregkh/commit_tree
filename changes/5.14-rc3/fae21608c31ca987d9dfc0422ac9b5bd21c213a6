scsi: mpt3sas: Transition IOC to Ready state during shutdown

The IOC firmware assumes that the host driver is still alive after shutdown
and continues to post events to host memory (due to faulty expander phy
links, etc). This leads to 0x2666 (a bus fault occurred during a host-IOC
memory access).

Perform an IOC soft reset as part of shutdown to disable event posting.
