mm: rmap: make try_to_unmap() void function

Currently try_to_unmap() return bool value by checking page_mapcount(),
however this may return false positive since page_mapcount() doesn't check
all subpages of compound page.  The total_mapcount() could be used
instead, but its cost is higher since it traverses all subpages.

Actually the most callers of try_to_unmap() don't care about the return
value at all.  So just need check if page is still mapped by page_mapped()
when necessary.  And page_mapped() does bail out early when it finds
mapped subpage.
