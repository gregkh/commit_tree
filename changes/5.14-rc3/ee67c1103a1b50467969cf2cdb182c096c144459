arm64: acpi: Map EFI_MEMORY_WT memory as Normal-NC

The only user we have of Normal Write-Through memory is in the ACPI code
when mapping memory regions advertised as EFI_MEMORY_WT. Since most (all?)
CPUs treat write-through as non-cacheable under the hood, don't bother
with the extra memory type here and just treat EFI_MEMORY_WT the same way
as EFI_MEMORY_WC by mapping it to the Normal-NC memory type instead and
emitting a warning if we have failed to find an alternative EFI memory
type.
