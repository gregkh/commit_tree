jump_label, x86: Allow short NOPs

Now that objtool is able to rewrite jump_label instructions, have the
compiler emit a JMP, such that it can decide on the optimal encoding,
and set jump_entry::key bit1 to indicate that objtool should rewrite
the instruction to a matching NOP.

For x86_64-allyesconfig this gives:

  jl\     NOP     JMP
  short:  22997   124
  long:   30874   90

IOW, we save (22997+124) * 3 bytes of kernel text in hotpaths.
