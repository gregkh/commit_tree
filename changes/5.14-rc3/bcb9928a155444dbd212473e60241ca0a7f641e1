net: dsa: properly check for the bridge_leave methods in dsa_switch_bridge_leave()

This was not caught because there is no switch driver which implements
the .port_bridge_join but not .port_bridge_leave method, but it should
nonetheless be fixed, as in certain conditions (driver development) it
might lead to NULL pointer dereference.
