ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Make regmap cache only on probe()

Currently the tlv320aic31xx driver has regulator support but does not
enable the regulators during probe, deferring this until something causes
ASoC to make the card active. It does put the device into cache only mode
but only when the component level probe is called, however if interrupts
are in use the driver will access the regmap before then which if the
regulators are not powered on would cause I/O problems.
