cifs: support share failover when remounting

When remouting a DFS share, force a new DFS referral of the path and
if the currently cached targets do not match any of the new targets or
there was no cached targets, then mark it for reconnect.

For example:

    $ mount //dom/dfs/link /mnt -o username=foo,password=bar
    $ ls /mnt
    oldfile.txt

    change target share of 'link' in server settings

    $ mount /mnt -o remount,username=foo,password=bar
    $ ls /mnt
    newfile.txt
