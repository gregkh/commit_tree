usb: ehci: Prevent missed ehci interrupts with edge-triggered MSI

When MSI is used by the ehci-hcd driver, it can cause lost interrupts which
results in EHCI only continuing to work due to a polling fallback. But the
reliance of polling drastically reduces performance of any I/O through EHCI.

Interrupts are lost as the EHCI interrupt handler does not safely handle
edge-triggered interrupts. It fails to ensure all interrupt status bits are
cleared, which works with level-triggered interrupts but not the
edge-triggered interrupts typical from using MSI.

To fix this problem, check if the driver may have raced with the hardware
setting additional interrupt status bits and clear status until it is in a
stable state.
