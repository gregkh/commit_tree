arm64: dts: qcom: msm8994-angler: Fix gpio-reserved-ranges 85-88

Reserve GPIO pins 85-88 as these aren't meant to be accessible from the
application CPUs (causes reboot). Yet another fix similar to
9134586715e3, 5f8d3ab136d0, which is needed to allow angler to boot after
3edfb7bd76bd ("gpiolib: Show correct direction from the beginning").

Fixes: feeaf56ac78d ("arm64: dts: msm8994 SoC and Huawei Angler (Nexus 6P) support")
