powerpc/xmon: Add support for running a command on all cpus in xmon

It is sometimes desirable to run a command on all cpus in xmon. A
typical scenario is to obtain the backtrace from all cpus in xmon if
there is a soft lockup. Add rudimentary support for the same. The
command to be run on all cpus should be prefixed with 'c#'. As an
example, 'c#t' will run 't' command and produce a backtrace on all cpus
in xmon.

Since many xmon commands are not sensible for running in this manner, we
only allow a predefined list of commands -- 'r', 'S' and 't' for now.
