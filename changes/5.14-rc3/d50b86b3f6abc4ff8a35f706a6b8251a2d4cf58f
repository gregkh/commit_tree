ASoC: rk817: remove redundant assignment to pointer node, add missing of_node_put

The pointer node is being initialized with a value that is never read and
it is being updated later with a new value.  The initialization is
redundant and can be removed.

The function is missing a of_node_put on node, fix this by adding the call
before returning.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
