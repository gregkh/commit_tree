selftests: mptcp: fix case multiple subflows limited by server

After patch "mptcp: fix syncookie process if mptcp can not_accept new
subflow", if subflow is limited, MP_JOIN SYN is dropped, and no SYN/ACK
will be replied.

So in case "multiple subflows limited by server", the expected SYN/ACK
number should be 1.
