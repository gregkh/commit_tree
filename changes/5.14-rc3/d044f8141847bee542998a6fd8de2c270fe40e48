arm64: Fix comments to refer to correct function __flush_icache_range

Many comments refer to the function flush_icache_range, where the
intent is in fact __flush_icache_range. Fix these comments to
refer to the intended function.

That's probably due to commit 3b8c9f1cdfc506e9 ("arm64: IPI each
CPU after invalidating the I-cache for kernel mappings"), which
renamed flush_icache_range() to __flush_icache_range() and added
a wrapper.

No functional change intended.
