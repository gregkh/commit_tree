iio: chemical: atlas: Fix buffer alignment in iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()

Variable location for the timestamp, so just use __aligned(8)
to ensure it is always possible to naturally align it.

Found during an audit of all calls of uses of
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()

Fixes tag is not accurate, but it will need manual backporting beyond
that point if anyone cares.
