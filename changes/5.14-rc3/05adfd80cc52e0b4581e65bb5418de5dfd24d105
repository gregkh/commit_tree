drm/amdgpu: Use delayed work to collect RAS error counters

On Context Query2 IOCTL return the correctable and
uncorrectable errors in O(1) fashion, from cached
values, and schedule a delayed work function to
calculate and cache them for the next such IOCTL.

v2: Cancel pending delayed work at ras_fini().
v3: Remove conditionals when dealing with delayed
    work manipulation as they're inherently racy.
