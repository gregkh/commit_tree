usb: xhci: avoid renesas_usb_fw.mem when it's unusable

Commit a66d21d7dba8 ("usb: xhci: Add support for Renesas controller with
memory") added renesas_usb_fw.mem firmware reference to xhci-pci.  Thus
modinfo indicates xhci-pci.ko has "firmware: renesas_usb_fw.mem".  But
the firmware is only actually used with CONFIG_USB_XHCI_PCI_RENESAS.  An
unusable firmware reference can trigger safety checkers which look for
drivers with unmet firmware dependencies.

Avoid referring to renesas_usb_fw.mem in circumstances when it cannot be
loaded (when CONFIG_USB_XHCI_PCI_RENESAS isn't set).
