gpio: stmpe: fully use convert probe to device-managed

The IRQ is registered via devm_request_threaded_irq(), making the driver
only partially device-managed. This changeset converts the entire driver
to using only devres APIs.

This change also removes platform_set_drvdata() since the information is
never retrieved to be used in the driver.
