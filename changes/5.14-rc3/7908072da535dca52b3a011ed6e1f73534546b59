arm64: Do not enable uaccess for invalidate_icache_range

invalidate_icache_range() works on kernel addresses, and doesn't
need uaccess. Remove the code that toggles uaccess_ttbr0_enable,
as well as the code that emits an entry into the exception table
(via the macro invalidate_icache_by_line).

Changes return type of invalidate_icache_range() from int (which
used to indicate a fault) to void, since it doesn't need uaccess
and won't fault. Note that return value was never checked by any
of the callers.

No functional change intended.
Possible performance impact due to the reduced number of
instructions.
