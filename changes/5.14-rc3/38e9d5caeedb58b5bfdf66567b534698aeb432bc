iio: chemical: sgp30: Drop use of %hx in format string.

Since:
commit cbacb5ab0aa0 ("docs: printk-formats: Stop encouraging use of
unnecessary %h[xudi] and %hh[xudi]")
use of these format strings has been discouraged.

As there are only a few such uses in IIO, lets clear them all out and
avoid chance of them getting copied into new drivers.
