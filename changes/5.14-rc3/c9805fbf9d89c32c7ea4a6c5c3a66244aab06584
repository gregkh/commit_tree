serial: 8250_aspeed_vuart: initialize vuart->port in aspeed_vuart_probe()

Previously this had only been initialized if we hit the throttling path
in aspeed_vuart_handle_irq(); moving it to the probe function is a
slight consistency improvement and avoids redundant reinitialization in
the interrupt handler.  It also serves as preparation for converting the
driver's I/O accesses to use port->port.membase instead of its own
vuart->regs.
