drm/i915: Don't include intel_de.h from intel_display_types.h

Hoist the intel_de.h include from intel_display_types.h one
level up. I need this in order to untangle the include order
so that I can add tracepoints into intel_de.h.

This little cocci script did most of the work for me:
@find@
@@
(
intel_de_read(...)
|
intel_de_read_fw(...)
|
intel_de_write(...)
|
intel_de_write_fw(...)
)

@has_include@
@@
(
 #include "intel_de.h"
|
 #include "display/intel_de.h"
)

@depends on find && !has_include@

+ #include "intel_de.h"
  #include "intel_display_types.h"

@depends on find && !has_include@
