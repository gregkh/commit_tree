sctp: send the next probe immediately once the last one is acked

These is no need to wait for 'interval' period for the next probe
if the last probe is already acked in search state. The 'interval'
period waiting should be only for probe failure timeout and the
current pmtu check when it's in search complete state.

This change will shorten the probe time a lot in search state, and
also fix the document accordingly.
