iio: magn: bmc150: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

probe() error paths after runtime pm is enabled, should disable it.
remove() should not call pm_runtime_put_noidle() as there is no
matching get() to have raised the reference count.  This case
has no affect a the runtime pm core protects against going negative.

Whilst here use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to tidy things up a little.
coccicheck script didn't get this one due to complex code structure so
found by inspection.
