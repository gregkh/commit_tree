r8152: Fix a deadlock by doubly PM resume

r8152 driver sets up the MAC address at reset-resume, while
rtl8152_set_mac_address() has the temporary autopm get/put.  This may
lead to a deadlock as the PM lock has been already taken for the
execution of the runtime PM callback.

This patch adds the workaround to avoid the superfluous autpm when
called from rtl8152_reset_resume().
