cifs: fix fallocate when trying to allocate a hole.

Remove the conditional checking for out_data_len and skipping the fallocate
if it is 0. This is wrong will actually change any legitimate the fallocate
where the entire region is unallocated into a no-op.

Additionally, before allocating the range, if FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE is set then
we need to clamp the length of the fallocate region as to not extend the size of the file.
