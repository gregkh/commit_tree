orinoco: Avoid field-overflowing memcpy()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring array fields.

Validate the expected key size and introduce a wrapping structure
to use as the multi-field memcpy() destination so that overflows
can be correctly detected.
