bnxt_en: don't disable an already disabled PCI device

If device is already disabled in reset path and PCI io error is
detected before the device could be enabled, driver could
call pci_disable_device() for already disabled device. Fix this
problem by calling pci_disable_device() only if the device is already
enabled.
