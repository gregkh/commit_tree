firmware: arm_scmi: Fix range check for the maximum number of pending messages

SCMI message headers carry a sequence number and such field is sized to
allow for MSG_TOKEN_MAX distinct numbers; moreover zero is not really an
acceptable maximum number of pending in-flight messages.

Fix accordingly the checks performed on the value exported by transports
in scmi_desc.max_msg
