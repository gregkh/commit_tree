usb: renesas_usbhs: Fix superfluous irqs happen after usb_pkt_pop()

This driver has a potential issue which this driver is possible to
cause superfluous irqs after usb_pkt_pop() is called. So, after
the commit 3af32605289e ("usb: renesas_usbhs: fix error return
code of usbhsf_pkt_handler()") had been applied, we could observe
the following error happened when we used g_audio.

    renesas_usbhs e6590000.usb: irq_ready run_error 1 : -22

To fix the issue, disable the tx or rx interrupt in usb_pkt_pop().
