regulator: fixed: Mark regulator-fixed-domain as deprecated

A power domain should not be modelled as a regulator, not even for the
simplest case as recent discussions have concluded around the existing
regulator-fixed-domain DT binding.

Fortunately, there is only one user of the binding that was recently added.
Therefore, let's mark the binding as deprecated to prevent it from being
further used.
