media: rcar-fcp: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
added pm_runtime_resume_and_get() in order to automatically handle
dev->power.usage_count decrement on errors.

Use the new API, in order to cleanup the error check logic.

As a bonus, pm_runtime_resume_and_get() always return 0 on success.
So, the code can be simplified.
