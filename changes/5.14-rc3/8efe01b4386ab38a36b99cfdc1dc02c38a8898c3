arm64: dts: rockchip: Update RK3399 PCI host bridge window to 32-bit address memory

The PCIe host bridge on RK3399 advertises a single 64-bit memory
address range even though it lies entirely below 4GB.

Previously the OF PCI range parser treated 64-bit ranges more
leniently (i.e., as 32-bit), but since commit 9d57e61bf723 ("of/pci:
Add IORESOURCE_MEM_64 to resource flags for 64-bit memory addresses")
the code takes a stricter view and treats the ranges as advertised in
the device tree (i.e, as 64-bit).

The change in behaviour causes failure when allocating bus addresses
to devices connected behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge that require
non-prefetchable memory ranges. The allocation failure was observed
for certain Samsung NVMe drives connected to RockPro64 boards.

Update the host bridge window attributes to treat it as 32-bit address
memory. This fixes the allocation failure observed since commit
9d57e61bf723.
