arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add pompom rev3

The only kernel visible change with respect to rev2 is that pompom
rev3 changed the charger thermistor from a 47k to a 100k NTC to use
a thermistor which is supported by the PM6150 ADC driver.

Disable the charger thermal zone for pompom rev1 and rev2 to avoid
the use of bogus temperature values from the unsupported thermistor.
