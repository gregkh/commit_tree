ASoC: qcom: Fix broken support to MI2S TERTIARY and QUATERNARY

lpass hdmi support patch totally removed support for MI2S TERTIARY
and QUATERNARY.

One of the major issue was spotted with the design of having
separate SoC specific header files for the common lpass driver.
This design is prone to break as an when new SoC header is added
as the common DAI ids of other SoCs will be overwritten by the
new ones.

Having a common header qcom,lpass.h should fix the issue and any new
DAI ids should be added to the common header.

With this change lpass also needs a new of_xlate function to resolve
dai name.
