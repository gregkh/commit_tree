fs: Handle I_DONTCACHE in iput_final() instead of generic_drop_inode()

If generic_drop_inode() returns true, it means iput_final() can evict
this inode regardless of whether it is dirty or not. If we check
I_DONTCACHE in generic_drop_inode(), any inode with this bit set will be
evicted unconditionally. This is not the desired behavior because
I_DONTCACHE only means the inode shouldn't be cached on the LRU list.
As for whether we need to evict this inode, this is what
generic_drop_inode() should do. This patch corrects the usage of
I_DONTCACHE.

This patch was proposed in [1].
