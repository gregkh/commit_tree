drm/amd/display: Add OPTC memory low power support

[Why]
The OPTC memory blocks should be powered down when they are not in use.
This will reduce power consumption.

[How]
1. Set ODM_MEM_UNASSIGNED_PWR_MODE to shutdown memory when unassigned
2. Set ODM_MEM_VBLANK_PWR_MODE to light sleep mode when in vblank
3. Added a debug option to allow this behaviour to be turned off
4. Restructured debug options to use a bitfield in a way that's more clear
