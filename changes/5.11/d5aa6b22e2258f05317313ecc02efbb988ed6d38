SUNRPC: xprt_load_transport() needs to support the netid "rdma6"

According to RFC5666, the correct netid for an IPv6 addressed RDMA
transport is "rdma6", which we've supported as a mount option since
Linux-4.7. The problem is when we try to load the module "xprtrdma6",
that will fail, since there is no modulealias of that name.

Fixes: 181342c5ebe8 ("xprtrdma: Add rdma6 option to support NFS/RDMA IPv6")
