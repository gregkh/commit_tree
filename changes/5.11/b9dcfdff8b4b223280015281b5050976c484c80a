selftests/vm: use a common gup_test.h

Avoid the need to copy-paste the gup_test ioctl commands and the struct
gup_test definition, between the kernel and the user space application, by
providing a new header file for these.  This allows easier and safer
adding of new ioctl calls, as well as reducing the overall line count.

Details: The header file has to be able to compile independently, because
of the arguably unfortunate way that the Makefile is written: the Makefile
tries to build all of its prerequisites, when really it should be only
building the .c files, and leaving the other prerequisites (LOCAL_HDRS) as
pure dependencies.

That Makefile limitation is probably not worth fixing, but it explains why
one of the includes had to be moved into the new header file.

Also: simplify the ioctl struct (struct gup_test), by deleting the unused
__expansion[10] field.  This sort of thing is what you might see in a
stable ABI, but this low-level, kernel-developer-oriented selftests/vm
system is very much not subject to ABI stability.  So "expansion" and
"reserved" fields are unnecessary here.
