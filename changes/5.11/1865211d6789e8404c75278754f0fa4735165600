ALSA: usb-audio: Move snd_usb_autoresume() call out of setup_hw_info()

This is a preliminary work for the upcoming hw-constraint change for
the implicit feedback mode.

Currently snd_usb_autoresume() is called at the end of
setup_hwinfo().  It's a bit confusing; because of this implicit
refcount usage, the caller side needs to call snd_usb_autosuspend()
later in the error path although it's not seen inside the function.
Instead, it's clearer to call both snd_usb_autoresume() and suspend()
in the very same function.

It's only refactoring and no functional changes.
