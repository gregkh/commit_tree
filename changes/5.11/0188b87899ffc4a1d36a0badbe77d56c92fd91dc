kretprobe: Avoid re-registration of the same kretprobe earlier

Our system encountered a re-init error when re-registering same kretprobe,
where the kretprobe_instance in rp->free_instances is illegally accessed
after re-init.

Implementation to avoid re-registration has been introduced for kprobe
before, but lags for register_kretprobe(). We must check if kprobe has
been re-registered before re-initializing kretprobe, otherwise it will
destroy the data struct of kretprobe registered, which can lead to memory
leak, system crash, also some unexpected behaviors.

We use check_kprobe_rereg() to check if kprobe has been re-registered
before running register_kretprobe()'s body, for giving a warning message
and terminate registration process.
