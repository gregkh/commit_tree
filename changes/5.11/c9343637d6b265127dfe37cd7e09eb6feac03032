s390/ftrace: assume -mhotpatch or -mrecord-mcount always available

Currently the kernel minimal compiler requirement is gcc 4.9 or
clang 10.0.1.
* gcc -mhotpatch option is supported since 4.8.
* A combination of -pg -mrecord-mcount -mnop-mcount -mfentry flags is
supported since gcc 9 and since clang 10.

Drop support for old -pg function prologues. Which leaves binary
compatible -mhotpatch / -mnop-mcount -mfentry prologues in a form:
	brcl	0,0
Which are also do not require initial nop optimization / conversion and
presence of _mcount symbol.
