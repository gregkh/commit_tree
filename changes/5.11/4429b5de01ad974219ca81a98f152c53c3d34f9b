drm/virtio: implement blob resources: report blob mem to userspace

The stride field has never been used, so repurpose it to be
"blob_mem". This way, userspace can know the memory properties
of the blob if it's passed between userspace processes and
no suitable userspace API exists to transmit that knowledge.
