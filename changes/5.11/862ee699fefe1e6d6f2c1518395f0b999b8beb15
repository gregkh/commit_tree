USB: sisusbvga: Make console support depend on BROKEN

The console part of sisusbvga is broken vs. printk(). It uses in_atomic()
to detect contexts in which it cannot sleep despite the big fat comment in
preempt.h which says: Do not use in_atomic() in driver code.

in_atomic() does not work on kernels with CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT=n which
means that spin/rw_lock held regions are not detected by it.

There is no way to make this work by handing context information through to
the driver and this only can be solved once the core printk infrastructure
supports sleepable console drivers.

Make it depend on BROKEN for now.
