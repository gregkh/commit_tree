arm64: Remove arm64_dma32_phys_limit and its uses

With the introduction of a dynamic ZONE_DMA range based on DT or IORT
information, there's no need for CMA allocations from the wider
ZONE_DMA32 since on most platforms ZONE_DMA will cover the 32-bit
addressable range. Remove the arm64_dma32_phys_limit and set
arm64_dma_phys_limit to cover the smallest DMA range required on the
platform. CMA allocation and crashkernel reservation now go in the
dynamically sized ZONE_DMA, allowing correct functionality on RPi4.
