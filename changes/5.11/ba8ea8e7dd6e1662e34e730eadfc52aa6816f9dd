tick/sched: Remove bogus boot "safety" check

can_stop_idle_tick() checks whether the do_timer() duty has been taken over
by a CPU on boot. That's silly because the boot CPU always takes over with
the initial clockevent device.

But even if no CPU would have installed a clockevent and taken over the
duty then the question whether the tick on the current CPU can be stopped
or not is moot. In that case the current CPU would have no clockevent
either, so there would be nothing to keep ticking.

Remove it.
