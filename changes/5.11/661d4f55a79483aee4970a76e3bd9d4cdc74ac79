sbitmap: remove swap_lock

map->swap_lock protects map->cleared from concurrent modification,
however sbitmap_deferred_clear() is already atomically drains it, so
it's guaranteed to not loose bits on concurrent
sbitmap_deferred_clear().

A one threaded tag heavy test on top of nullbk showed ~1.5% t-put
increase, and 3% -> 1% cycle reduction of sbitmap_get() according to perf.
