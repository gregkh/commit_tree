Patch fixes uninitialized variable warning in bad_accesses test

bad_accesses.c: In function ‘bad_access’:
bad_accesses.c:52:9: error: ‘x’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
   printf("Bad - no SEGV! (%c)\n", x);
         ^
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
