io_uring: iopoll requests should also wake task ->in_idle state

If we're freeing/finishing iopoll requests, ensure we check if the task
is in idling in terms of cancelation. Otherwise we could end up waiting
forever in __io_uring_task_cancel() if the task has active iopoll
requests that need cancelation.
