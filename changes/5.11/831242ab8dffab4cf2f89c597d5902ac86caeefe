checkpatch: add fix and improve warning msg for non-standard signature

Currently checkpatch warns for BAD_SIGN_OFF on non-standard signature
styles.

A large number of these warnings occur because of typo mistakes in
signature tags.  An evaluation over v4.13..v5.8 showed that out of 539
warnings due to non-standard signatures, 87 are due to typo mistakes.

Following are the standard signature tags which are often incorrectly
used, along with their individual counts of incorrect use (over
v4.13..v5.8):

Provide a fix by calculating levenshtein distance for the signature tag
with all the standard signatures and suggest a fix with a signature, whose
edit distance is less than or equal to 2 with the misspelled signature.

Out of the 86 mispelled signatures fixed with this approach, 85 were found
to be good corrections and 1 was bad correction.

Following was found to be a bad correction:
