rwsem: Implement down_read_killable_nested

In preparation for converting exec_update_mutex to a rwsem so that
multiple readers can execute in parallel and not deadlock, add
down_read_killable_nested.  This is needed so that kcmp_lock
can be converted from working on a mutexes to working on rw_semaphores.
