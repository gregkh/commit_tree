staging: mt7621-pci: parse and prepare resources in 'mt7621_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges'

Remove 'mt7621_pcie_add_resources' where resources are added to the host
windows moving this code into the function where all the parsing and
preparing code is being done: 'mt7621_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges'.
The memory resource has been properly parsed for the PCI APIs so we
only need to retrieve it and use it in those places we need.
