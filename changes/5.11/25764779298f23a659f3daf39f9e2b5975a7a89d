A function has a different name between their prototype
and its kernel-doc markup:

	../net/tipc/link.c:2551: warning: expecting prototype for link_reset_stats(). Prototype was for tipc_link_reset_stats() instead
	../net/tipc/node.c:1678: warning: expecting prototype for is the general link level function for message sending(). Prototype was for tipc_node_xmit() instead
