drm/i915: WA for platforms with double buffered address update enable bit

In Gen 9 and Gen 10 platforms, async address update enable bit is
double buffered. Due to this, during the transition from async flip
to sync flip we have to wait until this bit is updated before continuing
with the normal commit for sync flip.

v9: -Rename skl_toggle_async_sync() to skl_disable_async_flip_wa(). (Ville)
    -Place the declarations appropriately as per need. (Ville)
    -Take the lock before the reg read. (Ville)
    -Fix comment and formatting. (Ville)
    -Use IS_GEN_RANGE() for gen check. (Ville)
    -Move skl_disable_async_flip_wa() to intel_pre_plane_update(). (Ville)

v10: -Rebased.
