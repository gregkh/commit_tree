HID: Increase HID maximum report size to 16KB

Currently the maximum HID report size which can be buffered by the kernel is
8KB. This is sufficient for the vast majority of HID devices on the market, as
most HID reports are fairly small.

However, some unusual devices such as the Elgate Stream Deck exist which use a
report size slightly over 8KB for the image data that is sent to the device.
Reports these large cannot be buffered by the regular HID subsystem currently,
thus the only way to use such device is to bypass the HID subsystem entirely.

This increases the maximum HID report size to 16KB, which should cover all
sanely designed HID devices.
