mm: hugetlbfs: fix cannot migrate the fallocated HugeTLB page

If a new hugetlb page is allocated during fallocate it will not be
marked as active (set_page_huge_active) which will result in a later
isolate_huge_page failure when the page migration code would like to
move that page.  Such a failure would be unexpected and wrong.

Only export set_page_huge_active, just leave clear_page_huge_active as
static.  Because there are no external users.
