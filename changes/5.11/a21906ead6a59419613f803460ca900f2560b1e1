drm/i915/display/fbc: Implement WA 22010751166

Underruns happens when plane height + y offset is not a modulo of 4
when FBC is enabled. It happens when scanline is at vactive - 10 but
that is not feasible to do from the software side so here completely
disabling FBC when height + y offset matches to avoid visual glitches.

Specification says that it only affects TGL display C stepping and
newer but to simply the check and as TGL is already in final costumers
hands, pre-production display stepping A and B was also included.
