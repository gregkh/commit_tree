nvme-fc: avoid calling _nvme_fc_abort_outstanding_ios from interrupt context

Recent patches changed calling sequences. nvme_fc_abort_outstanding_ios
used to be called from a timeout or work context. Now it is being called
in an io completion context, which can be an interrupt handler.
Unfortunately, the abort outstanding ios routine attempts to stop nvme
queues and nested routines that may try to sleep, which is in conflict
with the interrupt handler.

Correct replacing the direct call with a work element scheduling, and the
abort outstanding ios routine will be called in the work element.
