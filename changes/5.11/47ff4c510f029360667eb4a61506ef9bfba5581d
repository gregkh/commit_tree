scsi: lpfc: Enable common send_io interface for SCSI and NVMe

To set up common use by the SCSI and NVMe I/O paths, create a new routine
that issues FCP I/O commands which can be used by either protocol.  The new
routine addresses SLI-3 vs SLI-4 differences within its implementation.

Replace the (SLI-3 centric) iocb routine in the SCSI path with this new
WQE-centric common routine.
