leds: rt8515: Add Richtek RT8515 LED driver

This adds a driver for the Richtek RT8515 dual channel
torch/flash white LED driver.

This LED driver is found in some mobile phones from
Samsung such as the GT-S7710 and GT-I8190.

A V4L interface is added.

We do not have a proper datasheet for the RT8515 but
it turns out that RT9387A has a public datasheet and
is essentially the same chip. We designed the driver
in accordance with this datasheet. The day someone
needs to drive a RT9387A this driver can probably
easily be augmented to handle that chip too.

Sakari Ailus, Pavel Machek and Andy Shevchenko helped
significantly in getting this driver right.
