usb: dwc3: ulpi: Use VStsDone to detect PHY regs access completion

In accordance with [1] the DWC_usb3 core sets the GUSB2PHYACCn.VStsDone
bit when the PHY vendor control access is done and clears it when the
application initiates a new transaction. The doc doesn't say anything
about the GUSB2PHYACCn.VStsBsy flag serving for the same purpose. Moreover
we've discovered that the VStsBsy flag can be cleared before the VStsDone
bit. So using the former as a signal of the PHY control registers
completion might be dangerous. Let's have the VStsDone flag utilized
instead then.
