media: ccs-pll: Add trivial dual PLL support

Add support for sensors that have separate VT and OP domain PLLs.

This support is trivial in the sense that it aims for the same VT pixel
rate than that on the CSI-2 bus. The vast majority of sensors is better
supported by higher frequencies in VT domain in binned and possibly scaled
configurations.
