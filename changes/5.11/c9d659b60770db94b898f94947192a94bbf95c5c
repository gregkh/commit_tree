PCI/ERR: Bind RCEC devices to the Root Port driver

If a Root Complex Integrated Endpoint (RCiEP) is implemented, it may signal
errors through a Root Complex Event Collector (RCEC).  Each RCiEP must be
associated with no more than one RCEC.

For an RCEC (which is technically not a Bridge), error messages "received"
from associated RCiEPs must be enabled for "transmission" in order to cause
a System Error via the Root Control register or (when the Advanced Error
Reporting Capability is present) reporting via the Root Error Command
register and logging in the Root Error Status register and Error Source
Identification register.

Given the commonality with Root Ports and the need to also support AER and
PME services for RCECs, extend the Root Port driver to support RCEC devices
by adding the RCEC Class ID to the driver structure.
