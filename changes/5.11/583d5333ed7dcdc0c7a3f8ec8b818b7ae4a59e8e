net: hdlc_fr: Simpify fr_rx by using "goto rx_drop" to drop frames

When the fr_rx function drops a received frame (because the protocol type
is not supported, or because the PVC virtual device that corresponds to
the DLCI number and the protocol type doesn't exist), the function frees
the skb and returns.

The code for freeing the skb and returning is repeated several times, this
patch uses "goto rx_drop" to replace them so that the code looks cleaner.
