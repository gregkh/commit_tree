powerpc/vdso: Add missing includes and clean vdso_setup_syscall_map()

Instead of including extern references locally in
vdso_setup_syscall_map(), add the missing headers.

sys_ni_syscall() being a function, cast its address to
an unsigned long instead of declaring it as a fake
unsigned long object.

At the same time, remove a comment which paraphrases the
function name.
