s390/vfio-ap: clean up vfio_ap resources when KVM pointer invalidated

The vfio_ap device driver registers a group notifier with VFIO when the
file descriptor for a VFIO mediated device for a KVM guest is opened to
receive notification that the KVM pointer is set (VFIO_GROUP_NOTIFY_SET_KVM
event). When the KVM pointer is set, the vfio_ap driver takes the
following actions:
1. Stashes the KVM pointer in the vfio_ap_mdev struct that holds the state
   of the mediated device.
2. Calls the kvm_get_kvm() function to increment its reference counter.
3. Sets the function pointer to the function that handles interception of
   the instruction that enables/disables interrupt processing.
4. Sets the masks in the KVM guest's CRYCB to pass AP resources through to
   the guest.

In order to avoid memory leaks, when the notifier is called to receive
notification that the KVM pointer has been set to NULL, the vfio_ap device
driver should reverse the actions taken when the KVM pointer was set.
