crypto: lib/sha256 - Don't clear temporary variables

The assignments to clear a through h and t1/t2 are optimized out by the
compiler because they are unused after the assignments.

Clearing individual scalar variables is unlikely to be useful, as they
may have been assigned to registers, and even if stack spilling was
required, there may be compiler-generated temporaries that are
impossible to clear in any case.

So drop the clearing of a through h and t1/t2.
