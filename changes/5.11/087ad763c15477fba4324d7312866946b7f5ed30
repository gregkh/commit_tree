Revert "of: platform: Batch fwnode parsing when adding all top level devices"

This reverts commit 93d2e4322aa74c1ad1e8c2160608eb9a960d69ff.

The fw_devlink_pause/resume() optimization attempt is getting replaced
with a much more robust optimization by the end of this series. So, stop
using those APIs.
