kasan: fix stack traces dependency for HW_TAGS

Currently, whether the alloc/free stack traces collection is enabled by
default for hardware tag-based KASAN depends on CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL.
The intention for this dependency was to only enable collection on slow
debug kernels due to a significant perf and memory impact.

As it turns out, CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL is not considered a debug option
and is enabled on many productions kernels including Android and Ubuntu.
As the result, this dependency is pointless and only complicates the
code and documentation.

Having stack traces collection disabled by default would make the
hardware mode work differently to to the software ones, which is
confusing.

This change removes the dependency and enables stack traces collection
by default.

Looking into the future, this default might makes sense for production
kernels, assuming we implement a fast stack trace collection approach.
