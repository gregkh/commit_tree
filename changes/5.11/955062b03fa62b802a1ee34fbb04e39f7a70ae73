net: bridge: mcast: add support for raw L2 multicast groups

Extend the bridge multicast control and data path to configure routes
for L2 (non-IP) multicast groups.

The uapi struct br_mdb_entry union u is extended with another variant,
mac_addr, which does not change the structure size, and which is valid
when the proto field is zero.

To be compatible with the forwarding code that is already in place,
which acts as an IGMP/MLD snooping bridge with querier capabilities, we
need to declare that for L2 MDB entries (for which there exists no such
thing as IGMP/MLD snooping/querying), that there is always a querier.
Otherwise, these entries would be flooded to all bridge ports and not
just to those that are members of the L2 multicast group.

Needless to say, only permanent L2 multicast groups can be installed on
a bridge port.
