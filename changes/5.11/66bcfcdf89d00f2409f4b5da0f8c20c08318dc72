seqlock: Prefix internal seqcount_t-only macros with a "do_"

When the seqcount_LOCKNAME_t group of data types were introduced, two
classes of seqlock.h sequence counter macros were added:

  - An external public API which can either take a plain seqcount_t or
    any of the seqcount_LOCKNAME_t variants.

  - An internal API which takes only a plain seqcount_t.

To distinguish between the two groups, the "*_seqcount_t_*" pattern was
used for the latter. This confused a number of mm/ call-site developers,
and Linus also commented that it was not a standard practice for marking
seqlock.h internal APIs.

Distinguish the latter group of macros by prefixing a "do_".
