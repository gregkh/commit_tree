drm/nouveau: fix dma syncing warning with debugging on.

Since I wrote the below patch if you run a debug kernel you can a
dma debug warning like:
nouveau 0000:1f:00.0: DMA-API: device driver tries to sync DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000016e012000] [size=4096 bytes]

The old nouveau code wasn't consolidate the pages like the ttm code,
but the dma-debug expects the sync code to give it the same base/range
pairs as the allocator.

Fix the nouveau sync code to consolidate pages before calling the
sync code.
