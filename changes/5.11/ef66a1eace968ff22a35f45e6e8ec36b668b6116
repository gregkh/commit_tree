ibmvnic: Clear failover_pending if unable to schedule

Normally we clear the failover_pending flag when processing the reset.
But if we are unable to schedule a failover reset we must clear the
flag ourselves. We could fail to schedule the reset if we are in PROBING
state (eg: when booting via kexec) or because we could not allocate memory.

Thanks to Cris Forno for helping isolate the problem and for testing.
