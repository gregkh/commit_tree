dt-bindings:iio:accel:fsl,mma8452: txt to yaml conversion.

Simple binding so mostly straight forward to convert.
Original binding was unclear on how many interrupts there are.
The device has two such lines, whilst I believe the driver currently
only uses one at a time.  The binding should allow both to be specified.
