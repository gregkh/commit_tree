powerpc/mm: Move setting PTE specific flags to pfn_pmd()

powerpc used to set the PTE specific flags in set_pte_at(). That is
different from other architectures. To be consistent with other
architectures powerpc updated pfn_pte() to set _PAGE_PTE in commit
379c926d6334 ("powerpc/mm: move setting pte specific flags to
pfn_pte")

That commit didn't do the same for pfn_pmd() because we expect
pmd_mkhuge() to do that. But as per Linus that is a bad rule:

  The rule that you must use "pmd_mkhuge()" seems _completely_ wrong.
  The only valid use to ever make a pmd out of a pfn is to make a
  huge-page.

Hence update pfn_pmd() to set _PAGE_PTE.
