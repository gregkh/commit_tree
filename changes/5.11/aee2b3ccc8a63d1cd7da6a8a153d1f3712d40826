can: tcan4x5x: fix bittiming const, use common bittiming from m_can driver

According to the TCAN4550 datasheet "SLLSF91 - DECEMBER 2018" the tcan4x5x has
the same bittiming constants as a m_can revision 3.2.x/3.3.0.

The tcan4x5x chip I'm using identifies itself as m_can revision 3.2.1, so
remove the tcan4x5x specific bittiming values and rely on the values in the
m_can driver, which are selected according to core revision.
