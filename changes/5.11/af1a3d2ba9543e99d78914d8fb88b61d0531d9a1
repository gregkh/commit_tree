cifs: In the new mount api we get the full devname as source=

so we no longer need to handle or parse the UNC= and prefixpath=
options that mount.cifs are generating.

This also fixes a bug in the mount command option where the devname
would be truncated into just //server/share because we were looking
at the truncated UNC value and not the full path.

I.e.  in the mount command output the devive //server/share/path
would show up as just //server/share
