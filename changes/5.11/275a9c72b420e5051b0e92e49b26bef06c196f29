dpaa_eth: reserve space for the xdp_frame under the A050385 erratum

When the erratum workaround is triggered, the newly created xdp_frame
structure is stored at the start of the newly allocated buffer. Avoid
the structure from being overwritten by explicitly reserving enough
space in the buffer for storing it.

Account for the fact that the structure's size might increase in time by
aligning the headroom to DPAA_FD_DATA_ALIGNMENT bytes, thus guaranteeing
the data's alignment.
