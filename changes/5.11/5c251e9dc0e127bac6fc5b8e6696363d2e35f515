signal: Add task_sigpending() helper

This is in preparation for maintaining signal_pending() as the decider of
whether or not a schedule() loop should be broken, or continue sleeping.
This is different than the core signal use cases, which really need to know
whether an actual signal is pending or not. task_sigpending() returns
non-zero if TIF_SIGPENDING is set.

Only core kernel use cases should care about the distinction between
the two, make sure those use the task_sigpending() helper.
