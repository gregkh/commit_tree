scsi: ufs-pci: Ensure UFS device is in PowerDown mode for suspend-to-disk ->poweroff()

The expectation for suspend-to-disk is that devices will be powered-off, so
the UFS device should be put in PowerDown mode. If spm_lvl is not 5, then
that will not happen. Change the pm callbacks to force spm_lvl 5 for
suspend-to-disk poweroff.
