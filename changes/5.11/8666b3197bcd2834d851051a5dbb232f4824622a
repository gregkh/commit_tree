media: i2c: ov5695: simplify getting state container

The pointer to 'struct v4l2_subdev' is stored in drvdata via
v4l2_i2c_subdev_init() so there is no point of a dance like:

    struct i2c_client *client = to_i2c_client(struct device *dev)
    struct v4l2_subdev *sd = i2c_get_clientdata(client);

This allows to remove local variable 'client' and few pointer
dereferences.
