iommu/hyper-v: Remove I/O-APIC ID check from hyperv_irq_remapping_select()

commit a491bb19f728 ("iommu/hyper-v: Implement select() method on remapping
irqdomain") restricted the irq_domain_ops::select() callback to match on
I/O-APIC index 0, which was correct until the parameter was changed to
carry the I/O APIC ID in commit f36a74b9345a.

If the ID is not 0 then the match fails. Therefore I/O-APIC init fails to
retrieve the parent irqdomain for the I/O-APIC resulting in a boot panic:

    kernel BUG at arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:2408!

Fix it by matching the I/O-APIC independent of the ID as there is only one
I/O APIC emulated by Hyper-V.
