gpio: ep93xx: Fix single irqchip with multi gpiochips

Fixes the following warnings which results in interrupts disabled on
port B/F:

gpio gpiochip1: (B): detected irqchip that is shared with multiple gpiochips: please fix the driver.
gpio gpiochip5: (F): detected irqchip that is shared with multiple gpiochips: please fix the driver.

- added separate irqchip for each interrupt capable gpiochip
- provided unique names for each irqchip
