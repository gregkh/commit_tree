ALSA: usb-audio: workaround for iface reset issue

The recently introduced sample rate validation code seems causing a
problem on some devices; namely, after performing this, the bus gets
screwed and it influences even on other USB devices.
As a quick workaround, perform it only for the necessary devices;
currently MOTU devices are known to need the valid altset checks, so
filter out other devices.
