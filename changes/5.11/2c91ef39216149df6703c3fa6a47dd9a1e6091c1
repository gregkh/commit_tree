KVM: arm64: Allow PSCI SYSTEM_OFF/RESET to return

The KVM/arm64 PSCI relay assumes that SYSTEM_OFF and SYSTEM_RESET should
not return, as dictated by the PSCI spec. However, there is firmware out
there which breaks this assumption, leading to a hyp panic. Make KVM
more robust to broken firmware by allowing these to return.
