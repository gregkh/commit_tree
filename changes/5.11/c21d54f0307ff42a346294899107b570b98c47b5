KVM: x86: hyper-v: allow KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID as a system ioctl

KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID is a vCPU ioctl but its output is now
independent from vCPU and in some cases VMMs may want to use it as a system
ioctl instead. In particular, QEMU doesn CPU feature expansion before any
vCPU gets created so KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID can't be used.

Convert KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID to 'dual' system/vCPU ioctl with the
same meaning.
