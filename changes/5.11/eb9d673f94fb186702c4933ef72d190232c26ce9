pinctrl: renesas: Reorder struct sh_pfc_pin to remove hole

On arm64, pointer size and alignment is 64-bit, hence a 4-byte hole is
present in between the enum_id and name members of the sh_pfc_pin
structure.  Get rid of this hole by sorting the structure's members by
decreasing size.

This saves up to 1.5 KiB per enabled SoC, and reduces the size of a
kernel including support for all R-Car Gen3 SoCs by more than 10 KiB.

This has no size impact on SH and arm32.
