dm crypt: fix copy and paste bug in crypt_alloc_req_aead

In commit d68b29584c25 ("dm crypt: use GFP_ATOMIC when allocating
crypto requests from softirq") code was incorrectly copy and pasted
from crypt_alloc_req_skcipher()'s crypto request allocation code to
crypt_alloc_req_aead(). It is OK from runtime perspective as both
simple encryption request pointer and AEAD request pointer are part of
a union, but may confuse code reviewers.
