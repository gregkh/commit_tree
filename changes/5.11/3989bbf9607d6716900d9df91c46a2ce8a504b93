perf tests tsc: Make tsc testing as a common testing

x86 arch provides the testing for conversion between tsc and perf time,
the testing is located in x86 arch folder.  Move this testing out from
x86 arch folder and place it into the common testing folder, so allows
to execute tsc testing on other architectures (e.g. Arm64).

This patch removes the inclusion of "arch-tests.h" from the testing
code, this can avoid building failure if any arch has no this header
file.

Committer testing:

  $ perf test -v tsc
  Couldn't bump rlimit(MEMLOCK), failures may take place when creating BPF maps, etc
  70: Convert perf time to TSC                                        :
