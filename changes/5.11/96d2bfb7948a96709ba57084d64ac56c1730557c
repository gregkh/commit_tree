iwlwifi: mvm: clear IN_D3 after wowlan status cmd

In D3 resume flow, avoid the following race where sending
packets before updating the sequence number (sequence
number received from the wowlan status command response):
Thread 1:
__iwl_mvm_resume clears IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_D3 and is cut
by thread 2 before reaching iwl_mvm_query_wakeup_reasons.
Thread 2:
iwl_mvm_mac_itxq_xmit calls iwl_mvm_tx_skb since
IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_D3 is not set using a wrong sequence number.
Thread 1:
__iwl_mvm_resume continues and calls iwl_mvm_query_wakeup_reasons
updating the sequence number received from the firmware.

The next packet that will be sent now will cause sysassert 0x1096.

Fix the bug by moving 'clear IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_D3' to after
sending the wowlan status command and updating the sequence
number.
