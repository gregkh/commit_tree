s390/qeth: set static link info during initialization

Hard-code the minimal link info at initialization time, after we
obtained the link_type. qeth_get_link_ksettings() can still override
this with more accurate data from QUERY CARD INFO later on.

Don't set arbitrary defaults for unknown OSA link types, they
certainly won't match any future type.
