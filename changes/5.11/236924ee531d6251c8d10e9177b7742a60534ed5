spi: ar934x: Don't leak SPI master in probe error path

If the call to devm_spi_register_controller() fails on probe of the
Qualcomm Atheros AR934x/QCA95xx SPI driver, the spi_controller struct is
erroneously not freed.  Fix by switching over to the new
devm_spi_alloc_master() helper.

Moreover, the controller's clock is enabled on probe but not disabled if
any of the subsequent probe steps fail.

Finally, there's an ordering issue in ar934x_spi_remove() wherein the
clock is disabled even though the controller is not yet unregistered.
It is unregistered after ar934x_spi_remove() by the devres framework.
As long as it is not unregistered, SPI transfers may still be ongoing
and disabling the clock may break them.  It is not possible to use
devm_spi_register_controller() in this case, so move to the non-devm
variant.

All of these bugs have existed since the driver was first introduced,
so it seems fair to fix them together in a single commit.
