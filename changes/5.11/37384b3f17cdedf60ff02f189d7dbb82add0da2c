drm/amd/display: Set DC options from modifiers.

This sets the DC tiling options from the modifier, if modifiers
are used for the FB. This patch by itself does not expose the
support yet though.

There is not much validation yet to limit the scope of this
patch, but the current validation is at the same level as
the BO metadata path.

v2: Add modifier check to should_reset_plane.
