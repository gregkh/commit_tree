syscalls: Fix file comments for syscalls implemented in kernel/sys.c

The relevant syscalls were previously moved from kernel/timer.c to kernel/sys.c,
but the comments weren't updated to reflect this change.

Fixing these comments messes up the alphabetical ordering of syscalls by
filename. This could be fixed by merging the two groups of kernel/sys.c syscalls,
but that would require reordering the syscalls and renumbering them to maintain
the numerical order in unistd.h.
