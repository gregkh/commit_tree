bcache: only check feature sets when sb->version >= BCACHE_SB_VERSION_CDEV_WITH_FEATURES

For super block version < BCACHE_SB_VERSION_CDEV_WITH_FEATURES, it
doesn't make sense to check the feature sets. This patch checks
super block version in bch_has_feature_* routines, if the version
doesn't have feature sets yet, returns 0 (false) to the caller.

Fixes: 5342fd425502 ("bcache: set bcache device into read-only mode for BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_OBSO_LARGE_BUCKET")
Fixes: ffa470327572 ("bcache: add bucket_size_hi into struct cache_sb_disk for large bucket")
