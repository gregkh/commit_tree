net: vlan: avoid leaks on register_vlan_dev() failures

VLAN checks for NETREG_UNINITIALIZED to distinguish between
registration failure and unregistration in progress.

Since commit cb626bf566eb ("net-sysfs: Fix reference count leak")
registration failure may, however, result in NETREG_UNREGISTERED
as well as NETREG_UNINITIALIZED.

This fix is similer to cebb69754f37 ("rtnetlink: Fix
memory(net_device) leak when ->newlink fails")
