KVM: SVM: Support string IO operations for an SEV-ES guest

For an SEV-ES guest, string-based port IO is performed to a shared
(un-encrypted) page so that both the hypervisor and guest can read or
write to it and each see the contents.

For string-based port IO operations, invoke SEV-ES specific routines that
can complete the operation using common KVM port IO support.
