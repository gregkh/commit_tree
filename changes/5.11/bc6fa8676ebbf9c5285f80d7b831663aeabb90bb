drm/bridge/lontium-lt9611uxc: move HPD notification out of IRQ handler

drm hotplug handling code (drm_client_dev_hotplug()) can wait on mutex,
thus delaying further lt9611uxc IRQ events processing.  It was observed
occasionally during bootups, when drm_client_modeset_probe() was waiting
for EDID ready event, which was delayed because IRQ handler was stuck
trying to deliver hotplug event.
Move hotplug notifications from IRQ handler to separate work to be able
to process IRQ events without delays.
