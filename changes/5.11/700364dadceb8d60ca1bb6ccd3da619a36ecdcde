MIPS: mscc: Prepare configuration to handle more SoCs

Ocelot belongs to a family of SoC named the VCore III. In order to add
these new Soc, use the new symbol SOC_VCOREIII instead of a one
dedicated to Ocelot.

In order to avoid regression on driver building, the MSCC_OCELOT
configuration symbol is kept until the driver will be converted.
