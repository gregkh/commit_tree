apparmor: remove duplicate macro list_entry_is_head()

Strangely I hadn't had noticed the existence of the list_entry_is_head()
in apparmor code when added the same one in the list.h.  Luckily it's
fully identical and didn't break builds.  In any case we don't need a
duplicate anymore, thus remove it from apparmor code.
