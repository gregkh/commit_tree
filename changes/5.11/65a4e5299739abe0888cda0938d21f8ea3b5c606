kunit: tool: Force the use of the 'tty' console for UML

kunit_tool relies on the UML console outputting printk() output to the
tty in order to get results. Since the default console driver could
change, pass 'console=tty' to the kernel.

This is triggered by a change[1] to use ttynull as a fallback console
driver which -- by chance or by design -- seems to have changed the
default console output on UML, breaking kunit_tool. While this may be
fixed, we should be less fragile to such changes in the default.
