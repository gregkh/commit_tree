bpf: Avoid hashtab deadlock with map_locked

If a hashtab is accessed in both non-NMI and NMI context, the system may
deadlock on bucket->lock. Fix this issue with percpu counter map_locked.
map_locked rejects concurrent access to the same bucket from the same CPU.
To reduce memory overhead, map_locked is not added per bucket. Instead,
8 percpu counters are added to each hashtab. buckets are assigned to these
counters based on the lower bits of its hash.
