tmpfs: disallow CONFIG_TMPFS_INODE64 on alpha

As with s390, alpha is a 64-bit architecture with a 32-bit ino_t.  With
CONFIG_TMPFS_INODE64=y tmpfs mounts will get 64-bit inode numbers and
display "inode64" in the mount options, whereas passing "inode64" in the
mount options will fail.  This leads to erroneous behaviours such as
this:

  # mkdir mnt
  # mount -t tmpfs nodev mnt
  # mount -o remount,rw mnt
  mount: /home/ubuntu/mnt: mount point not mounted or bad option.

Prevent CONFIG_TMPFS_INODE64 from being selected on alpha.
