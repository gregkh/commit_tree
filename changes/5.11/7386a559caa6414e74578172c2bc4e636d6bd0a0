arm64: dts: amlogic: meson-g12: Set FL-adj property value

In accordance with the DWC USB3 bindings the property is supposed to have
uint32 type. It's erroneous from the DT schema and driver points of view
to declare it as boolean. As Neil suggested set it to 0x20 so not break
the platform and to make the dtbs checker happy.
