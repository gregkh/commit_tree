perf arm-spe: Include bitops.h for BIT() macro

Include header linux/bitops.h, directly use its BIT() macro and remove
the self defined macros.

Committer notes:

Use BIT_ULL() instead of BIT to build on 32-bit arches as mentioned in
review by Andre Przywara <andre.przywara@arm.com>. I noticed the build
failure when crossbuilding to arm32 from x86_64.
