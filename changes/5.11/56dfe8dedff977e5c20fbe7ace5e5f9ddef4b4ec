net: ipa: use version in gsi_channel_init()

A quirk of IPA v4.2 requires the AP to allocate the GSI channels
that are owned by the modem.

Rather than pass a flag argument to gsi_channel_init(), use the
IPA version directly in that function to determine whether modem
channels need to be allocated.
