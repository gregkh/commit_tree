tick/sched: Use tick_next_period for lockless quick check

No point in doing calculations.

   tick_next_period = last_jiffies_update + tick_period

Just check whether now is before tick_next_period to figure out whether
jiffies need an update.

Add a comment why the intentional data race in the quick check is safe or
not so safe in a 32bit corner case and why we don't worry about it.
