platform/x86: Intel PMT Crashlog capability driver

Add support for the Intel Platform Monitoring Technology crashlog
interface. This interface provides a few sysfs values to allow for
controlling the crashlog telemetry interface as well as a character
driver to allow for mapping the crashlog memory region so that it can be
accessed after a crashlog has been recorded.

This driver is meant to only support the server version of the crashlog
which is identified as crash_type 1 with a version of zero. Currently no
other types are supported.
