dt-bindings: leds: Convert pwm to yaml

The example was adapted in the following ways:

- make use of the now supported 'function' and 'color' properties
- remove pwm nodes, those are documented elsewhere
- align node names to new dt schema rules and dt recommendations

License was not explicitly set before.  The license set now is
recommended by DT project.
