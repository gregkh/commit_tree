drm/amd/display: Acquire DSC during split stream for ODM only if top_pipe

[WHY]
DSC should only be acquired per OPP. Therefore, DSC should only
be acquired for the top_pipe when ODM is enabled.
Not doing this check may lead to acquiring more DSC's than needed
when doing MPO + ODM Combine.

[HOW]
Only acquire DSC if pipe is top_pipe.
