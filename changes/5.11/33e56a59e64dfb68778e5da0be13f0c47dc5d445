string.h: add FORTIFY coverage for strscpy()

The fortified version of strscpy ensures the following before vanilla strscpy
is called:

1. There is no read overflow because we either size is smaller than
   src length or we shrink size to src length by calling fortified
   strnlen.

2. There is no write overflow because we either failed during
   compilation or at runtime by checking that size is smaller than dest
   size.
