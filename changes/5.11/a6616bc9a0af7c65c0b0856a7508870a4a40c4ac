iwlwifi: dbg: Don't touch the tlv data

The commit ba8f6f4ae254 ("iwlwifi: dbg: add dumping special device
memory") added a termination of name string just to be sure, and this
seems causing a regression, a GPF triggered at firmware loading.
Basically we shouldn't modify the firmware data that may be provided
as read-only.

This patch drops the code that caused the regression and keep the tlv
data as is.
