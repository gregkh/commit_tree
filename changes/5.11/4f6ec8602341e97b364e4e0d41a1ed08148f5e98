mm/vmalloc: separate put pages and flush VM flags

When VM_MAP_PUT_PAGES was added, it was defined with the same value as
VM_FLUSH_RESET_PERMS.  This doesn't seem like it will cause any big
functional problems other than some excess flushing for VM_MAP_PUT_PAGES
allocations.

Redefine VM_MAP_PUT_PAGES to have its own value.  Also, rearrange things
so flags are less likely to be missed in the future.
