xhci: fix bounce buffer usage for non-sg list case

xhci driver may in some special cases need to copy small amounts
of payload data to a bounce buffer in order to meet the boundary
and alignment restrictions set by the xHCI specification.

In the majority of these cases the data is in a sg list, and
driver incorrectly assumed data is always in urb->sg when using
the bounce buffer.

If data instead is contiguous, and in urb->transfer_buffer, we may still
need to bounce buffer a small part if data starts very close (less than
packet size) to a 64k boundary.

Check if sg list is used before copying data to/from it.
