selftests/bpf: Fix invalid use of strncat in test_sockmap

strncat()'s third argument is how many bytes will be added *in addition* to
already existing bytes in destination. Plus extra zero byte will be added
after that. So existing use in test_sockmap has many opportunities to overflow
the string and cause memory corruptions. And in this case, GCC complains for
a good reason.
