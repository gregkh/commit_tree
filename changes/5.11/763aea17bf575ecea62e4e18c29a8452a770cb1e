drm/fb-helper: Unmap client buffer during shutdown

The fbdev helper's generic probe function establishes a mapping for
framebuffers without shadow buffer. The clean-up function did not unmap
the buffer object. Add the unmap operation.

As fbdev devices are usally released during system shutdown, this has
not been a problem in practice.
