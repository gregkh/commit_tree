i2c: mediatek: Move suspend and resume handling to NOIRQ phase

Some i2c device driver indirectly uses I2C driver when it is now
being suspended. The i2c devices driver is suspended during the
NOIRQ phase and this cannot be changed due to other dependencies.
Therefore, we also need to move the suspend handling for the I2C
controller driver to the NOIRQ phase as well.
