drm/mediatek: avoid dereferencing a null hdmi_phy on an error message

Currently there is a null pointer check for hdmi_phy that implies it
may be null, however a dev_err messages dereferences this potential null
pointer.  Avoid a null pointer dereference by only emitting the dev_err
message if hdmi_phy is non-null.  It is a moot point if the error message
needs to be printed at all, but since this is a relatively new piece of
code it may be useful to keep the message in for the moment in case there
are unforseen errors that need to be reported.
