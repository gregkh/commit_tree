ARM: 9020/1: mm: use correct section size macro to describe the FDT virtual address

Commit

  149a3ffe62b9dbc3 ("9012/1: move device tree mapping out of linear region")

created a permanent, read-only section mapping of the device tree blob
provided by the firmware, and added a set of macros to get the base and
size of the virtually mapped FDT based on the physical address. However,
while the mapping code uses the SECTION_SIZE macro correctly, the macros
use PMD_SIZE instead, which means something entirely different on ARM when
using short descriptors, and is therefore not the right quantity to use
here. So replace PMD_SIZE with SECTION_SIZE. While at it, change the names
of the macro and its parameter to clarify that it returns the virtual
address of the start of the FDT, based on the physical address in memory.
