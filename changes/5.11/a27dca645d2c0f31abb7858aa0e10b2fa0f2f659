x86/io_apic: Cleanup trigger/polarity helpers

'trigger' and 'polarity' are used throughout the I/O-APIC code for handling
the trigger type (edge/level) and the active low/high configuration. While
there are defines for initializing these variables and struct members, they
are not used consequently and the meaning of 'trigger' and 'polarity' is
opaque and confusing at best.

Rename them to 'is_level' and 'active_low' and make them boolean in various
structs so it's entirely clear what the meaning is.
