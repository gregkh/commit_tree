mm: fix kernel-doc markups

Kernel-doc markups should use this format:
        identifier - description

Fix some issues on mm files:

1) The definition for get_user_pages_locked() doesn't follow it.  Also,
   it expects a short descrpition at the header, followed by a long one,
   after the parameters.  Fix it.

2) Kernel-doc requires that a kernel-doc markup to be immediately below
   the function prototype, as otherwise it will rename it.  So, move
   get_pfnblock_flags_mask() description to the right place.

3) Make invalidate_mapping_pagevec() to also follow the expected
   kernel-doc format.

While here, fix a few minor English syntax issues, as suggested
by Matthew:
	will used -> will be used
	similar with -> similar to
