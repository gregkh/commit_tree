s390/idle: allow arch_cpu_idle() to be kprobed

Remove NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() for arch_cpu_idle(). This might have made
sense when enabled_wait() (aka arch_cpu_idle()) was called from
udelay.
But now there shouldn't be a reason why s390 should be the only
architecture which doesn't allow arch_cpu_idle() to be probed.
