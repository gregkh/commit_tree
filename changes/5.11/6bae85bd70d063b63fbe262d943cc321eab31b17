maintainers: update my email address

Change my email contact ahead of a likely painful eleven-month migration
to a certain cobalt enteprisey groupware cloud product that will totally
break my workflow.  Some day I may get used to having to email being
sequestered behind both claret and cerulean oath2+sms 2fa layers, but
for now I'll stick with keying in one password to receive an email vs.
the required four.
