ocxl: Assign a register set to a Logical Partition

Platform specific function to assign a register set to a Logical Partition.
The "ibm,mmio-atsd" property, provided by the firmware, contains the 16
base ATSD physical addresses (ATSD0 through ATSD15) of the set of MMIO
registers (XTS MMIO ATSDx LPARID/AVA/launch/status register).

For the time being, the ATSD0 set of registers is used by default.
