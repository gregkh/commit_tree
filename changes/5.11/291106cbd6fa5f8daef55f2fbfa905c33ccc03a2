drm/i915: Move hw.active assignment into intel_crtc_get_pipe_config()

No reason to make the callers of intel_crtc_get_pipe_config()
populate hw.active. Let's do it in intel_crtc_get_pipe_config()
itself. hw.enable we leave up to the callers since it's slightly
different for readout vs. state check.
