USB: typec: tcpm: Add a 30ms room for tPSSourceOn in PR_SWAP

TCPM state machine needs 20-25ms to enter the ErrorRecovery state after
tPSSourceOn timer timeouts. Change the timer from max 480ms to 450ms to
ensure that the timer complies with the Spec. In order to keep the
flexibility for other usecases using tPSSourceOn, add another timer only
for PR_SWAP.
