powerpc/64s: fix scv entry fallback flush vs interrupt

The L1D flush fallback functions are not recoverable vs interrupts,
yet the scv entry flush runs with MSR[EE]=1. This can result in a
timer (soft-NMI) or MCE or SRESET interrupt hitting here and overwriting
the EXRFI save area, which ends up corrupting userspace registers for
scv return.

Fix this by disabling RI and EE for the scv entry fallback flush.
