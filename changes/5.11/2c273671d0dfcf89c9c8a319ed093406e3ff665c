x86/sgx: Add wrappers for ENCLS functions

ENCLS is the userspace instruction which wraps virtually all
unprivileged SGX functionality for managing enclaves.  It is essentially
the ioctl() of instructions with each function implementing different
SGX-related functionality.

Add macros to wrap the ENCLS functionality. There are two main groups,
one for functions which do not return error codes and a “ret_” set for
those that do.

ENCLS functions are documented in Intel SDM section 36.6.
