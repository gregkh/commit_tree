Input: st1232 - wait until device is ready before reading resolution

According to the st1232 datasheet, the host has to wait for the device
to change into Normal state before accessing registers other than the
Status Register.

If the reset GPIO is wired, the device is powered on during driver
probe, just before reading the resolution.  However, the latter may
happen before the device is ready, leading to a probe failure:

    st1232-ts 1-0055: Failed to read resolution: -6

Fix this by waiting until the device is ready, by trying to read the
Status Register until it indicates so, or until timeout.

On Armadillo 800 EVA, typically the first read fails with an I2C
transfer error, while the second read indicates the device is ready.
