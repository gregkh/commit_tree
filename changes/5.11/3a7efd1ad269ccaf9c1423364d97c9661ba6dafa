io_uring: reinforce cancel on flush during exit

What 84965ff8a84f0 ("io_uring: if we see flush on exit, cancel related tasks")
really wants is to cancel all relevant REQ_F_INFLIGHT requests reliably.
That can be achieved by io_uring_cancel_files(), but we'll miss it
calling io_uring_cancel_task_requests(files=NULL) from io_uring_flush(),
because it will go through __io_uring_cancel_task_requests().

Just always call io_uring_cancel_files() during cancel, it's good enough
for now.
