ice: Remove vlan_ena from vsi structure

vlan_ena was introduced to track whether VLAN filters are enabled on
the device, but
1) checking for num_vlan > 1 already gives us this information, and is
currently used in this way throughout the code
2) the logic for vlan_ena is broken when multiple VLANs are active

Just remove vlan_ena and use num_vlan instead.
