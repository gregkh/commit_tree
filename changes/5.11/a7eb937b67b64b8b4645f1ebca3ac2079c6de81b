rcutorture: Don't do need_resched() testing if ->sync is NULL

If cur_ops->sync is NULL, rcu_torture_fwd_prog_nr() will nevertheless
attempt to call through it.  This commit therefore flags cases where
neither need_resched() nor call_rcu() forward-progress testing
can be performed due to NULL function pointers, and also causes
rcu_torture_fwd_prog_nr() to take an early exit if cur_ops->sync()
is NULL.
