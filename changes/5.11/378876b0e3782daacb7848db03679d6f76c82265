mm: memcontrol: eliminate redundant check in __mem_cgroup_insert_exceeded()

The mz->usage_in_excess >= mz_node->usage_in_excess check is exactly the
else case of mz->usage_in_excess < mz_node->usage_in_excess.  So we could
replace else if (mz->usage_in_excess >= mz_node->usage_in_excess) with
else equally.  Also drop the comment which doesn't really explain much.
