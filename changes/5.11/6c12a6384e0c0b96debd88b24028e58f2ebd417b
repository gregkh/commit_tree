s390/vfio-ap: No need to disable IRQ after queue reset

The queues assigned to a matrix mediated device are currently reset when:

* The VFIO_DEVICE_RESET ioctl is invoked
* The mdev fd is closed by userspace (QEMU)
* The mdev is removed from sysfs.

Immediately after the reset of a queue, a call is made to disable
interrupts for the queue. This is entirely unnecessary because the reset of
a queue disables interrupts, so this will be removed.

Furthermore, vfio_ap_irq_disable() does an unconditional PQAP/AQIC which
can result in a specification exception (when the corresponding facility
is not available), so this is actually a bugfix.
