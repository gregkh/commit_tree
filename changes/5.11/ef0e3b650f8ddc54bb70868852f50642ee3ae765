powerpc/perf: Fix Threshold Event Counter Multiplier width for P10

Threshold Event Counter Multiplier (TECM) is part of Monitor Mode
Control Register A (MMCRA). This field along with Threshold Event
Counter Exponent (TECE) is used to get threshould counter value.
In Power10, this is a 8bit field, so patch fixes the
current code to modify the MMCRA[TECM] extraction macro to
handle this change. ISA v3.1 says this is a 7 bit field but
POWER10 it's actually 8 bits which will hopefully be fixed
in ISA v3.1 update.
