vsock/virtio: update credit only if socket is not closed

If the socket is closed or is being released, some resources used by
virtio_transport_space_update() such as 'vsk->trans' may be released.

To avoid a use after free bug we should only update the available credit
when we are sure the socket is still open and we have the lock held.
