drm/sun4i: tcon: set sync polarity for tcon1 channel

Channel 1 has polarity bits for vsync and hsync signals but driver never
sets them. It turns out that with pre-HDMI2 controllers seemingly there
is no issue if polarity is not set. However, with HDMI2 controllers
(H6) there often comes to de-synchronization due to phase shift. This
causes flickering screen. It's safe to assume that similar issues might
happen also with pre-HDMI2 controllers.

Solve issue with setting vsync and hsync polarity. Note that display
stacks with tcon top have polarity bits actually in tcon0 polarity
register.
