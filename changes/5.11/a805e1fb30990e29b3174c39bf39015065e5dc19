KVM: arm64: Add SMC handler in nVHE EL2

Add handler of host SMCs in KVM nVHE trap handler. Forward all SMCs to
EL3 and propagate the result back to EL1. This is done in preparation
for validating host SMCs in KVM protected mode.

The implementation assumes that firmware uses SMCCC v1.2 or older. That
means x0-x17 can be used both for arguments and results, other GPRs are
preserved.
