ALSA: usb-audio: Factor out the implicit feedback quirk code

The code dealing with the implicit feedback mode grew recently, and
it's becoming messy.  As we receive more and more devices that need
the similar handling, it's better to be processed through a table
instead of the open code.

This patch moves the code that is relevant with parsing the implicit
feedback mode and some helpers into another file, implicit.c.  The
detection and the setup of the implicit feedback sync EPs are
rewritten to use the ID/class matching table instead.

There should be no functional changes.
