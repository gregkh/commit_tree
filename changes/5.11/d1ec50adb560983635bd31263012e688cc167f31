ep_insert(): move creation of wakeup source past the fl_ep_links insertion

That's the beginning of preparations for taking f_ep_links out of struct file.
If insertion might fail, we will need a new failure exit.  Having wakeup
source creation done after that point will simplify life there; ep_remove()
can (and commonly does) live with NULL epi->ws, so it can be used for
cleanup after ep_create_wakeup_source() failure.  It can't be used before
the rbtree insertion, though, so if we are to unify all old failure exits,
we need to move that thing down.  Then we would be free to do simple
kmem_cache_free() on the failure to insert into f_ep_links - no wakeup source
to leak on that failure exit.
