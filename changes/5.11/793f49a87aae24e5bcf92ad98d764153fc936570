firmware_loader: align .builtin_fw to 8

arm64 references the start address of .builtin_fw (__start_builtin_fw)
with a pair of R_AARCH64_ADR_PREL_PG_HI21/R_AARCH64_LDST64_ABS_LO12_NC
relocations.  The compiler is allowed to emit the
R_AARCH64_LDST64_ABS_LO12_NC relocation because struct builtin_fw in
include/linux/firmware.h is 8-byte aligned.

The R_AARCH64_LDST64_ABS_LO12_NC relocation requires the address to be a
multiple of 8, which may not be the case if .builtin_fw is empty.
Unconditionally align .builtin_fw to fix the linker error.  32-bit
architectures could use ALIGN(4) but that would add unnecessary
complexity, so just use ALIGN(8).
