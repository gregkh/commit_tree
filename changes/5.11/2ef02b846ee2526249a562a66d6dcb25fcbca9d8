usb: cdns3: imx: fix can't create core device the second time issue

The cdns3 core device is populated by calling of_platform_populate,
the flag OF_POPULATED is set for core device node, if this flag
is not cleared, when calling of_platform_populate the second time
after loading parent module again, the OF code will not try to create
platform device for core device.

To fix it, it uses of_platform_depopulate to depopulate the core
device which the parent created, and the flag OF_POPULATED for
core device node will be cleared accordingly.
