checkpatch: fix TYPO_SPELLING check for words with apostrophe

checkpatch reports a false TYPO_SPELLING warning for some words containing
an apostrophe when run with --codespell option.

A false positive is "doesn't".  Occurrence of the word causes checkpatch
to emit the following warning:

"WARNING: 'doesn'' may be misspelled - perhaps 'doesn't'?"

Modify the regex pattern to be more in line with the codespell default
word matching regex.  This fixes the word capture and avoids the false
warning.

In addition, highlight the misspelled word location by adding a caret
below the word.
