r8169: fix WoL on shutdown if CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ is set

So far phy_disconnect() is called before free_irq(). If CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ
is set and interrupt is shared, then free_irq() creates an "artificial"
interrupt by calling the interrupt handler. The "link change" flag is set
in the interrupt status register, causing phylib to eventually call
phy_suspend(). Because the net_device is detached from the PHY already,
the PHY driver can't recognize that WoL is configured and powers down the
PHY.
