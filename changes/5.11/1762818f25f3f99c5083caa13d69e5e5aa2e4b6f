crypto: lib/sha256 - Use memzero_explicit() for clearing state

Without the barrier_data() inside memzero_explicit(), the compiler may
optimize away the state-clearing if it can tell that the state is not
used afterwards. At least in lib/crypto/sha256.c:__sha256_final(), the
function can get inlined into sha256(), in which case the memset is
optimized away.
