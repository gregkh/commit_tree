gpiolib: Unify expectations about ->request() returned value

Half of the code in the GPIO library is written in an expectation that
any non-zero value returned from the ->request() callback is an error code,
while some code checks only for negative values.

Unify expectations about ->request() returned value to be non-zero
for an error and 0 for the success.
