net-sysfs: take the rtnl lock when storing xps_rxqs

Two race conditions can be triggered when storing xps rxqs, resulting in
various oops and invalid memory accesses:

1. Calling netdev_set_num_tc while netif_set_xps_queue:

   - netif_set_xps_queue uses dev->tc_num as one of the parameters to
     compute the size of new_dev_maps when allocating it. dev->tc_num is
     also used to access the map, and the compiler may generate code to
     retrieve this field multiple times in the function.

   - netdev_set_num_tc sets dev->tc_num.

   If new_dev_maps is allocated using dev->tc_num and then dev->tc_num
   is set to a higher value through netdev_set_num_tc, later accesses to
   new_dev_maps in netif_set_xps_queue could lead to accessing memory
   outside of new_dev_maps; triggering an oops.

2. Calling netif_set_xps_queue while netdev_set_num_tc is running:

   2.1. netdev_set_num_tc starts by resetting the xps queues,
        dev->tc_num isn't updated yet.

   2.2. netif_set_xps_queue is called, setting up the map with the
        *old* dev->num_tc.

   2.3. netdev_set_num_tc updates dev->tc_num.

   2.4. Later accesses to the map lead to out of bound accesses and
        oops.

   A similar issue can be found with netdev_reset_tc.

One way of triggering this is to set an iface up (for which the driver
uses netdev_set_num_tc in the open path, such as bnx2x) and writing to
xps_rxqs in a concurrent thread. With the right timing an oops is
triggered.

Both issues have the same fix: netif_set_xps_queue, netdev_set_num_tc
and netdev_reset_tc should be mutually exclusive. We do that by taking
the rtnl lock in xps_rxqs_store.
