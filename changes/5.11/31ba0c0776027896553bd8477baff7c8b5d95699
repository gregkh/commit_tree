ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Modify existing helper to disable WAKEEN

Modify hda_codec_jack_wake_enable() to also support disable WAKEEN.
In addition, this patch also moves the WAKEEN disablement call out of
hda_codec_jack_check() into hda_codec_jack_wake_enable().

This is a preparation for next patch.

No functional change intended.
