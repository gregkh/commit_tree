net/vmw_vsock: fix NULL pointer dereference

In vsock_stream_connect(), a thread will enter schedule_timeout().
While being scheduled out, another thread can enter vsock_stream_connect()
as well and set vsk->transport to NULL. In case a signal was sent, the
first thread can leave schedule_timeout() and vsock_transport_cancel_pkt()
will be called right after. Inside vsock_transport_cancel_pkt(), a null
dereference will happen on transport->cancel_pkt.
