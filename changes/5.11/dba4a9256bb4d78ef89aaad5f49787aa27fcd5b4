net: Remove the err argument from sock_from_file

Currently, the sock_from_file prototype takes an "err" pointer that is
either not set or set to -ENOTSOCK IFF the returned socket is NULL. This
makes the error redundant and it is ignored by a few callers.

This patch simplifies the API by letting callers deduce the error based
on whether the returned socket is NULL or not.
