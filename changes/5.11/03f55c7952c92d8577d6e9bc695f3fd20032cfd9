kselftest: Extend vDSO selftest to clock_getres

The current version of the multiarch vDSO selftest verifies only
gettimeofday.

Extend the vDSO selftest to clock_getres, to verify that the
syscall and the vDSO library function return the same information.

The extension has been used to verify the hrtimer_resoltion fix.
