dt-bindings:iio:light:st,uvis25: txt to yaml conversion for this UV sensor

For the example, node name is uv-sensor because the standard option
of light-sensor seemed a little too generic for this.

This one could have just been moved to trivial-devices.yaml but for now
I have kept it as a separate doc.
