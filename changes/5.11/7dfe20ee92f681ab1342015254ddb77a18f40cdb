ASoC: qcom: Fix number of HDMI RDMA channels on sc7180

Suspending/resuming with an HDMI dongle attached leads to crashes from
an audio regmap.

I can reliably reproduce this problem by running 'tail' on the registers
file in debugfs for the hdmi regmap.

 # tail /sys/kernel/debug/regmap/62d87000.lpass-lpass_hdmi/registers
 [   84.658733] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffffd0128e800c

This crash happens because we're trying to read registers from the
regmap beyond the length of the mapping created by ioremap().

The number of hdmi_rdma_channels determines the size of the regmap via
this code in sound/soc/qcom/lpass-cpu.c:

  lpass_hdmi_regmap_config.max_register = LPAIF_HDMI_RDMAPER_REG(variant, variant->hdmi_rdma_channels);

According to debugfs the size of the regmap is 0x68010 but according to
the DTS file posted in [1] the size is only 0x68000 (see the first reg
property of the lpass_cpu node). Let's change the number of channels to
be 3 instead of 4 so the math works out to have a max register of
0x67010, nicely fitting inside of the region size of 0x68000.

Note: I tried to bump up the size of the register region to the next
page to include the 0x68010 register but then the tail command caused
SErrors with an async abort, implying that the register region doesn't
exist or it isn't clocked because the bus is telling us that the
register read failed. I reduce the number of channels and played audio
through the HDMI channel and it kept working so I think this is correct.
