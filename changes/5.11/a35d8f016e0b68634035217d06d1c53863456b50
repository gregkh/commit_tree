nilfs2: make splice write available again

Since 5.10, splice() or sendfile() to NILFS2 return EINVAL.  This was
caused by commit 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write
without explicit ops").

This patch initializes the splice_write field in file_operations, like
most file systems do, to restore the functionality.
