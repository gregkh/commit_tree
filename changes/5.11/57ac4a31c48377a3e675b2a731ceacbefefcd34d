net/mlx5e: Correctly handle changing the number of queues when the interface is down

This commit addresses two issues related to changing the number of
queues when the channels are closed:

1. Missing call to mlx5e_num_channels_changed to update
real_num_tx_queues when the number of TCs is changed.

2. When mlx5e_num_channels_changed returns an error, the channel
parameters must be reverted.

Two Fixes: tags correspond to the first commits where these two issues
were introduced.
