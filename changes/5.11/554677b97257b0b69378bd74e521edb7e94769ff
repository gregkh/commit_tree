ovl: perform vfs_getxattr() with mounter creds

The vfs_getxattr() in ovl_xattr_set() is used to check whether an xattr
exist on a lower layer file that is to be removed.  If the xattr does not
exist, then no need to copy up the file.

This call of vfs_getxattr() wasn't wrapped in credential override, and this
is probably okay.  But for consitency wrap this instance as well.
