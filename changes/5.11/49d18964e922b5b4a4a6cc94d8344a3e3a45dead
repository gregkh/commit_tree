mlxsw: Save EtherType as part of mlxsw_sp_nve_config

Add EtherType field to mlxsw_sp_nve_config struct.
Set EtherType according to mlxsw_sp_nve_params.ethertype.

Pass 'mlxsw_sp_nve_params' instead of 'mlxsw_sp_nve_params->dev' to the
function which initializes mlxsw_sp_nve_config struct to know which
EtherType to use.

This field is needed to configure which EtherType will be used when
VLAN is pushed at ingress of the tunnel port.
