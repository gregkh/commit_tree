vm_sockets: Add VMADDR_FLAG_TO_HOST vsock flag

Add VMADDR_FLAG_TO_HOST vsock flag that is used to setup a vsock
connection where all the packets are forwarded to the host.

Then, using this type of vsock channel, vsock communication between
sibling VMs can be built on top of it.

Changelog

v3 -> v4

* Update the "VMADDR_FLAG_TO_HOST" value, as the size of the field has
  been updated to 1 byte.

v2 -> v3

* Update comments to mention when the flag is set in the connect and
  listen paths.

v1 -> v2

* New patch in v2, it was split from the first patch in the series.
* Remove the default value for the vsock flags field.
* Update the naming for the vsock flag to "VMADDR_FLAG_TO_HOST".
