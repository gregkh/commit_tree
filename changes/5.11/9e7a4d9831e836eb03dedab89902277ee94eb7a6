bpf: Allow LSM programs to use bpf spin locks

Usage of spin locks was not allowed for tracing programs due to
insufficient preemption checks. The verifier does not currently prevent
LSM programs from using spin locks, but the helpers are not exposed
via bpf_lsm_func_proto.

Based on the discussion in [1], non-sleepable LSM programs should be
able to use bpf_spin_{lock, unlock}.

Sleepable LSM programs can be preempted which means that allowng spin
locks will need more work (disabling preemption and the verifier
ensuring that no sleepable helpers are called when a spin lock is held).
