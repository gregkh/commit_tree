media: netup_unidvb: Don't leak SPI master in probe error path

If the call to spi_register_master() fails on probe of the NetUP
Universal DVB driver, the spi_master struct is erroneously not freed.

Likewise, if spi_new_device() fails, the spi_controller struct is
not unregistered.  Plug the leaks.

While at it, fix an ordering issue in netup_spi_release() wherein
spi_unregister_master() is called after fiddling with the IRQ control
register.  The correct order is to call spi_unregister_master() *before*
this teardown step because bus accesses may still be ongoing until that
function returns.
