net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Handle error in serdes_get_regs

If the underlying read operation failed we would end up writing stale
data to the supplied buffer. This would end up with the last
successfully read value repeating. Fix this by only writing the data
when we know the read was good. This will mean that failed values will
return 0xffff.
