parisc: Enable -mlong-calls gcc option by default when !CONFIG_MODULES

When building a kernel without module support, the CONFIG_MLONGCALL option
needs to be enabled in order to reach symbols which are outside of a 22-bit
branch.

This patch changes the autodetection in the Kconfig script to always enable
CONFIG_MLONGCALL when modules are disabled and uses a far call to
preempt_schedule_irq() in intr_do_preempt() to reach the symbol in all cases.
