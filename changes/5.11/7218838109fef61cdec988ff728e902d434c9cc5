spi: dw-bt1: Fix undefined devm_mux_control_get symbol

I mistakenly added the select attributes to the SPI_DW_BT1_DIRMAP config
instead of having them defined in SPI_DW_BT1. If the kernel doesn't have
the MULTIPLEXER and MUX_MMIO configs manually enabled and the
SPI_DW_BT1_DIRMAP config hasn't been selected, Baikal-T1 SPI device will
always fail to be probed by the driver. Fix that and the error reported by
the test robot:

>> ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: devm_mux_control_get
   >>> referenced by spi-dw-bt1.c
   >>> spi/spi-dw-bt1.o:(dw_spi_bt1_sys_init) in archive drivers/built-in.a

by moving the MULTIPLEXER/MUX_MMIO configs selection to the SPI_DW_BT1
config.
