scsi: lpfc: Refactor WQE structure definitions for common use

In preparation of reworking the driver to use a native SLI-4 WQE interface
for the SCSI and NVMe I/O paths, start by commonizing the WQE exchange type
and command type attributes.

While adjusting these options also noted the variance in the pbde field.
Fix this by setting templates to 0 and in NVMe, which explicitly uses this
option, setting the value.
