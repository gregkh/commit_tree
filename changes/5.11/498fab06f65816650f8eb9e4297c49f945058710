drm/i915: Add debugfs dumping for bigjoiner, v3.

Dump debugfs and planar links as well, this will make it easier to debug
when things go wrong.

v4:
* Rebase
Changes since v1:
- Report planar slaves as such, now that we have the plane_state switch.
Changes since v2:
- Rebase on top of the new plane format dumping
