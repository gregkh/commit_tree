media: rockchip: rkisp1: carry ip version information

The IP block evolved from its rk3288/rk3399 base and the vendor
designates them with a numerical version. rk3399 for example
is designated V10 probably meaning V1.0.

There doesn't seem to be an actual version register we could read that
information from, so allow the match_data to carry that information
for future differentiation.

Also carry that information in the hw_revision field of the media-
controller API, so that userspace also has access to that.

The added versions are:
- V10: at least rk3288 + rk3399
- V11: seemingly unused as of now, but probably appeared in some soc
- V12: at least rk3326 + px30
- V13: at least rk1808
