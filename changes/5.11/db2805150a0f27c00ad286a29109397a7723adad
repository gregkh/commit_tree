net: octeontx2: Make sure the buffer is 128 byte aligned

The octeontx2 hardware needs the buffer to be 128 byte aligned.
But in the current implementation of napi_alloc_frag(), it can't
guarantee the return address is 128 byte aligned even the request size
is a multiple of 128 bytes, so we have to request an extra 128 bytes and
use the PTR_ALIGN() to make sure that the buffer is aligned correctly.
