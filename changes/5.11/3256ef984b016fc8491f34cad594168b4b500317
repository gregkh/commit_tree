ASoC: soc-core: Fix component name_prefix parsing

The "prefix" can be defined in DAI link node or it can be specified as
part of the component node itself. Currently "sound-name-prefix" defined
in a component is not taking effect. Actually the property is not getting
parsed. It can be fixed by parsing "sound-name-prefix" property whenever
"prefix" is missing in DAI link Codec node.
