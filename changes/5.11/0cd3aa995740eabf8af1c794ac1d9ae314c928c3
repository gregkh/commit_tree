mfd: kempld-core: Add support for additional devices

This update includes DMI IDs for the following Kontron modules and
systems:
COMe-bDV7, COMe-cDV7, COMe-m4AL, COMe-mCT10, SMARC-sXAL, SMARC-sXA4,
Qseven-Q7AL, mITX-APL, pITX-APL and KBox A-203

Furthermore the ACPI HID KEM0000 is added, as it is also reserved for
kempld devices.

Instead of also adding the newly supported devices to the Kconfig
description this patch removes the lengthy list. With future usage of
the ACPI HIDs it will not be necessary to explicitly add support for
each individual device to the driver and therefore the list would
become incomplete anyway.
