ASoC: mediatek: mt8192: skip first time data at the beginning of DMIC recording

We can choose to drop away any length of data from the beginning according
to project needs. Some projects don't want to throw away any data, because
they want to use recorded data to do echo cancellation, so they have to
make sure that they are aligned with the reference data as much as
possible. Or there are other algorithms in the upper layer to eliminate
this noise. Or some projects want to eliminate this noise form the kernel
layer. However, the minimum recommended value is 50ms to skip pop noise.
