net: watchdog: hold device global xmit lock during tx disable

Prevent netif_tx_disable() running concurrently with dev_watchdog() by
taking the device global xmit lock. Otherwise, the recommended:

	netif_carrier_off(dev);
	netif_tx_disable(dev);

driver shutdown sequence can happen after the watchdog has already
checked carrier, resulting in possible false alarms. This is because
netif_tx_lock() only sets the frozen bit without maintaining the locks
on the individual queues.
