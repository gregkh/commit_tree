crypto: tcrypt - include 1420 byte blocks in aead and skcipher benchmarks

WireGuard and IPsec both typically operate on input blocks that are
~1420 bytes in size, given the default Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes and
the overhead of the VPN metadata.

Many aead and sckipher implementations are optimized for power-of-2
block sizes, and whether they perform well when operating on 1420
byte blocks cannot be easily extrapolated from the performance on
power-of-2 block size. So let's add 1420 bytes explicitly, and round
it up to the next blocksize multiple of the algo in question if it
does not support 1420 byte blocks.
