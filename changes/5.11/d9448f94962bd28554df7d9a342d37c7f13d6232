selftest/bpf: Relax btf_dedup test checks

Remove the requirement of a strictly exact string section contents. This used
to be true when string deduplication was done through sorting, but with string
dedup done through hash table, it's no longer true. So relax test harness to
relax strings checks and, consequently, type checks, which now don't have to
have exactly the same string offsets.
