dpaa_eth: reduce data alignment requirements for the A050385 erratum

The 256 byte data alignment is required for preventing DMA transaction
splits when crossing 4K page boundaries. Since XDP deals only with page
sized buffers or less, this restriction isn't needed. Instead, the data
only needs to be aligned to 64 bytes to prevent DMA transaction splits.

These lessened restrictions can increase performance by widening the pool
of permitted data alignments and preventing unnecessary realignments.
