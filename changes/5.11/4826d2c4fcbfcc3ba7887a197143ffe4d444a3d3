net: phy: realtek: read actual speed on rtl8211f to detect downshift

The rtl8211f supports downshift and before commit 5502b218e001
("net: phy: use phy_resolve_aneg_linkmode in genphy_read_status")
the read-back of register MII_CTRL1000 was used to detect the
negotiated link speed.
The code added in commit d445dff2df60 ("net: phy: realtek: read
actual speed to detect downshift") is working fine also for this
phy and it's trivial re-using it to restore the downshift
detection on rtl8211f.

Add the phy specific read_status() pointing to the existing
function rtlgen_read_status().
