timekeeping: add CONFIG_LEGACY_TIMER_TICK

All platforms that currently do not use generic clockevents roughly call
the same set of functions in their timer interrupts: xtime_update(),
update_process_times() and profile_tick(), sometimes in a different
sequence.

Add a helper function that performs all three of them, to make the
callers more uniform and simplify the interface.
