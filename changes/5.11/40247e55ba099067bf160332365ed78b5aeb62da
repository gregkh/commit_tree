reboot: hide from sysfs not applicable settings

Not all the reboot settings from both the kernel command line or sysfs
interface are available to all platforms.

Filter out reboot_type and reboot_force which are x86 only, and also
remove reboot_cpu on kernels without SMP support.

This saves some space, and avoid confusing the user with settings which
will have no effect.
