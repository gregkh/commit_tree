i40e: Revert "i40e: don't report link up for a VF who hasn't enabled queues"

This reverts commit 2ad1274fa35ace5c6360762ba48d33b63da2396c

VF queues were not brought up when PF was brought up after being
downed if the VF driver disabled VFs queues during PF down.
This could happen in some older or external VF driver implementations.
The problem was that PF driver used vf->queues_enabled as a condition
to decide what link-state it would send out which caused the issue.

Remove the check for vf->queues_enabled in the VF link notify.
Now VF will always be notified of the current link status.
Also remove the queues_enabled member from i40e_vf structure as it is
not used anymore. Otherwise VNF implementation was broken and caused
a link flap.

The original commit was a workaround to avoid breaking existing VFs though
it's really a fault of the VF code not the PF. The commit should be safe to
revert as all of the VFs we know of have been fixed. Also, since we now
know there is a related bug in the workaround, removing it is preferred.
