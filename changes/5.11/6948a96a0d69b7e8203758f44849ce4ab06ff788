scsi: ufs: Relocate flush of exceptional event

The current flush location does not guarantee disabling BKOPS for the case
of requesting device power off.

 1) The exceptional event handler is queued

 2) ufs suspend starts with a request of device power off

 3) BKOPS is disabled in ufs suspend

 4) The queued work for the handler is done and BKOPS is re-enabled

Relocate the flush statement to ensure BKOPS remain disabled.
