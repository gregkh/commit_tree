Revert "RDMA/mlx5: Fix devlink deadlock on net namespace deletion"

This reverts commit fbdd0049d98d44914fc57d4b91f867f4996c787b.

Due to commit in fixes tag, netdevice events were received only in one net
namespace of mlx5_core_dev. Due to this when netdevice events arrive in
net namespace other than net namespace of mlx5_core_dev, they are missed.

This results in empty GID table due to RDMA device being detached from its
net device.

Hence, revert back to receive netdevice events in all net namespaces to
restore back RDMA functionality in non init_net net namespace. The
deadlock will have to be addressed in another patch.
