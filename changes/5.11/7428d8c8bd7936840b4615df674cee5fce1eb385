ASoC: soc-compress: assume SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_xxx and SND_COMPRESS_xxx are same

soc-compress.c is using both SND_COMPRESS_xxx and SND_PCM_STREAM_xxx.
These are defined as UAPI, and has same value.

	enum {
		SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK = 0,
		SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_CAPTURE,
		...
	};

	enum snd_compr_direction {
		SND_COMPRESS_PLAYBACK = 0,
		SND_COMPRESS_CAPTURE
	};

Essentially both COMPRESS and PCM_STREAM definitions are identical,
and can be never different because of ABI compatibility,
which means it's safe to mix both variants in the code.

This patch checks it by BUILD_BUG_ON(), and merge to use.
