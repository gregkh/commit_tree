habanalabs/gaudi: disable CGM at HW initialization

In case the clock gating was enabled in preboot we need to disable it
at the H/W initialization stage before touching the MME/TPC registers.
Otherwise, the ASIC can get stuck. If the security is enabled in
the firmware level, the CGM is always disabled and the driver can't
enable it.
