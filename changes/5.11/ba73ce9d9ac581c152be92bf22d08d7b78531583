arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add sc7180-lazor-r2/r3

Add configs for lazor rev2 and rev3. There are no relevant deltas
between rev1 and rev2, so just add the rev2 compatible string to the
rev1 config.

One important delta in rev3 is a switch of the power supply for the
onboard USB hub from 'pp3300_l7c' to 'pp3300_a' + a load switch. The
actual regulator switch is done by the patch 'arm64: dts: qcom:
sc7180-trogdor: Make pp3300_a the default supply for pp3300_hub',
since it affects the entire trogdor platform. Here we only add the
.dts files for lazor rev3 and replace the generic compatible entries
in the rev1 .dts files.
