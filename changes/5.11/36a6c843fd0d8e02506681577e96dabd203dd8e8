entry: Use different define for selector variable in SUD

Michael Kerrisk suggested that, from an API perspective, it is a bad
idea to share the PR_SYS_DISPATCH_ defines between the prctl operation
and the selector variable.

Therefore, define two new constants to be used by SUD's selector variable
and update the corresponding documentation and test cases.

While this changes the API syscall user dispatch has never been part of a
Linux release, it will show up for the first time in 5.11.
