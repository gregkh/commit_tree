net: gro: do not keep too many GRO packets in napi->rx_list

Commit c80794323e82 ("net: Fix packet reordering caused by GRO and
listified RX cooperation") had the unfortunate effect of adding
latencies in common workloads.

Before the patch, GRO packets were immediately passed to
upper stacks.

After the patch, we can accumulate quite a lot of GRO
packets (depdending on NAPI budget).

My fix is counting in napi->rx_count number of segments
instead of number of logical packets.
