drm/ttm: replace last move_notify with delete_mem_notify

The move notify callback is only used in one place, this should
be removed in the future, but for now just rename it to the use
case which is to notify the driver that the GPU memory is to be
deleted.

Drivers can be cleaned up after this separately.
