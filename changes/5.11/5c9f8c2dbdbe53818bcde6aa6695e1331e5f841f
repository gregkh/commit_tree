dmaengine: qcom: Add ADM driver

Add the DMA engine driver for the QCOM Application Data Mover (ADM) DMA
controller found in the MSM8x60 and IPQ/APQ8064 platforms.

The ADM supports both memory to memory transactions and memory
to/from peripheral device transactions.  The controller also provides
flow control capabilities for transactions to/from peripheral devices.

The initial release of this driver supports slave transfers to/from
peripherals and also incorporates CRCI (client rate control interface)
flow control.

The hardware only supports a 32 bit physical address, so specifying
!PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT gives maximum COMPILE_TEST coverage without having to
spend effort on kludging things in the code that will never actually be
needed on real hardware.
