USB: usblp: don't call usb_set_interface if there's a single alt

Some devices, such as the Winbond Electronics Corp. Virtual Com Port
(Vendor=0416, ProdId=5011), lockup when usb_set_interface() or
usb_clear_halt() are called. This device has only a single
altsetting, so it should not be necessary to call usb_set_interface().
