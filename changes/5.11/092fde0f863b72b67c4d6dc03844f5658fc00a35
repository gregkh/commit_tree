samples/bpf: Fix possible hang in xdpsock with multiple threads

Fix a possible hang in xdpsock that can occur when using multiple
threads. In this case, one or more of the threads might get stuck in
the while-loop in tx_only after the user has signaled the main thread
to stop execution. In this case, no more Tx packets will be sent, so a
thread might get stuck in the aforementioned while-loop. Fix this by
introducing a test inside the while-loop to check if the benchmark has
been terminated. If so, return from the function.
