net/vmw_vsock: improve locking in vsock_connect_timeout()

A possible locking issue in vsock_connect_timeout() was recognized by
Eric Dumazet which might cause a null pointer dereference in
vsock_transport_cancel_pkt(). This patch assures that
vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() will be called within the lock, so a race
condition won't occur which could result in vsk->transport to be set to NULL.

Fixes: 380feae0def7 ("vsock: cancel packets when failing to connect")
