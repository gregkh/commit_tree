iwlwifi: d3: do not send the WOWLAN_CONFIGURATION command for netdetect

This command should be used only when there's a real client station.
Currently it works, but since soon the driver will stop actually having
an auxiliary station by default, and this command requires _some_ valid
station, it needs to be removed from this flow.
