e1000e: Export S0ix flags to ethtool

This flag can be used by an end user to disable S0ix flows on a
buggy system or by an OEM for development purposes.

If you need this flag to be persisted across reboots, it's suggested
to use a udev rule to call adjust it until the kernel could have your
configuration in a disallow list.
