driver core: platform: Add devm_platform_get_irqs_affinity()

Drivers for multi-queue platform devices may also want managed interrupts
for handling HW queue completion interrupts, so add support.

The function accepts an affinity descriptor pointer, which covers all IRQs
expected for the device.

The function is devm class as the only current in-tree user will also use
devm method for requesting the interrupts; as such, the function is made
as devm as it can ensure ordering of freeing the irq and disposing of the
mapping.
