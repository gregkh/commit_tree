rcutorture: Make grace-period kthread report match RCU flavor being tested

At the end of the test and after rcu_torture_writer() stalls, rcutorture
invokes show_rcu_gp_kthreads() in order to dump out information on the
RCU grace-period kthread.  This makes a lot of sense when testing vanilla
RCU, but not so much for the other flavors.  This commit therefore allows
per-flavor kthread-dump functions to be specified.
