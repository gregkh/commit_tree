remoteproc: k3-r5: Extend support to R5F clusters on J7200 SoCs

The K3 J7200 SoC family has a revised R5F sub-system and contains a
subset of the R5F clusters present on J721E SoCs. The K3 J7200 SoCs
only have two dual-core Arm R5F clusters/subsystems with 2 R5F cores
each. One cluster is present within the MCU voltage domain (MCU_R5FSS0),
while the other is present in the MAIN voltage domain (MAIN_R5FSS0).

The revised IP has the following two new features:
 1. TCMs are auto-initialized during module power-up, and the behavior
    is programmable through a MMR bit.
 2. The LockStep-mode allows the Core1 TCMs to be combined with the
    Core0 TCMs effectively doubling the amount of TCMs available.
    The LockStep-mode on previous SoCs could only use the Core0 TCMs.
    This combined TCMs appear contiguous at the respective Core0 TCM
    addresses.

Extend the support to these clusters in the K3 R5F remoteproc driver
using J7200 specific compatibles. Logic for the second feature is
added in the next patch. The integration of these clusters is very
much similar to J721E SoCs otherwise.
