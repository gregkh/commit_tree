drivers: net: xilinx_emaclite: Fix -Wpointer-to-int-cast warnings with W=1

drivers/net/ethernet//xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c:341:35: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
  341 |   addr = (void __iomem __force *)((u32 __force)addr ^

Use uintptr_t instead of u32 to avoid problems on 64 bit systems.

Also, cast the address to an unsigned long for printing.
