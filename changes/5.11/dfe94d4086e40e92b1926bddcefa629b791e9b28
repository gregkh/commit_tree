x86/hyperv: Fix kexec panic/hang issues

Currently the kexec kernel can panic or hang due to 2 causes:

1) hv_cpu_die() is not called upon kexec, so the hypervisor corrupts the
old VP Assist Pages when the kexec kernel runs. The same issue is fixed
for hibernation in commit 421f090c819d ("x86/hyperv: Suspend/resume the
VP assist page for hibernation"). Now fix it for kexec.

2) hyperv_cleanup() is called too early. In the kexec path, the other CPUs
are stopped in hv_machine_shutdown() -> native_machine_shutdown(), so
between hv_kexec_handler() and native_machine_shutdown(), the other CPUs
can still try to access the hypercall page and cause panic. The workaround
"hv_hypercall_pg = NULL;" in hyperv_cleanup() is unreliabe. Move
hyperv_cleanup() to a better place.
