rtlwifi: rtl8192de: fix ofdm power compensation

ofdm_index[] is used to indicate how many power compensation is needed to
current thermal value. For internal PA module or 2.4G band, the min_index
is different from other cases.

This issue originally is reported by Dan. He found the size of ofdm_index[]
is 2, but access index 'i' may be equal to 2 if 'rf' is 2 in case of
'is2t'.

In fact, the chunk of code is added to wrong place, so move it back to
proper place, and then power compensation and buffer overflow are fixed.
