scsi: ufs-mediatek: Use correct path to fix compile error

When the kernel is compiled with allmodconfig, the following error is
reported:

In file included from drivers/scsi/ufs/ufs-mediatek-trace.h:36:0,
                 from drivers/scsi/ufs/ufs-mediatek.c:28:
./include/trace/define_trace.h:95:42: fatal error: ./ufs-mediatek-trace.h: No such file or directory
 #include TRACE_INCLUDE(TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE)

The comment in include/trace/define_trace.h specifies that:
TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH: Note, the path is relative to define_trace.h, not the
file including it. Full path names for out of tree modules must be used.

So without "CFLAGS_ufs-mediatek.o := -I$(src)", the current directory "."
is "include/trace/", the relative path of ufs-mediatek-trace.h is
"../../drivers/scsi/ufs/".
