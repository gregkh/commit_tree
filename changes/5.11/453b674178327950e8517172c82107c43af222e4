dt-bindings: usb: j721e: add ranges and dma-coherent props

Add missed 'ranges' and 'dma-coherent' properties as cdns-usb DT nodes has
child node and DMA IO is coherent on TI K3 J721E/J7200 SoCs.

This also fixes dtbs_check warning:
 cdns-usb@4104000: 'dma-coherent', 'ranges' do not match any of the regexes: '^usb@', 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'
