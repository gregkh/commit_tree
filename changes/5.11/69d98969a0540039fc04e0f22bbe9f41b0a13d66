can: rename get_can_dlc() macro with can_cc_dlc2len()

The get_can_dlc() macro is used to ensure the payload length information of
the Classical CAN frame to be max 8 bytes (the CAN_MAX_DLEN).

Rename the macro and use the correct constant in preparation of the len/dlc
cleanup for Classical CAN frames.
