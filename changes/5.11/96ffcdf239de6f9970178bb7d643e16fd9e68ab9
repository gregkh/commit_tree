PM / devfreq: Remove redundant governor_name from struct devfreq

The devfreq structure instance contains the governor_name and a governor
instance. When need to show the governor name, better to use the name
of devfreq_governor structure. So, governor_name variable in struct devfreq
is a redundant and unneeded variable. Remove the redundant governor_name
of struct devfreq and then use the name of devfreq_governor instance.
