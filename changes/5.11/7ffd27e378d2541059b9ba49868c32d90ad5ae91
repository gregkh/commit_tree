btrfs: pass bio_offset to check_data_csum() directly

Parameter icsum for check_data_csum() is a little hard to understand.
So is the phy_offset for btrfs_verify_data_csum().

Both parameters are calculated values for csum lookup.

Instead of some calculated value, just pass bio_offset and let the
final and only user, check_data_csum(), calculate whatever it needs.

Since we are here, also make the bio_offset parameter and some related
variables to be u32 (unsigned int).
As bio size is limited by its bi_size, which is unsigned int, and has
extra size limit check during various bio operations.
Thus we are ensured that bio_offset won't overflow u32.

Thus for all involved functions, not only rename the parameter from
@phy_offset to @bio_offset, but also reduce its width to u32, so we
won't have suspicious "u32 = u64 >> sector_bits;" lines anymore.
