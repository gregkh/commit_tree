net-sysfs: take the rtnl lock when accessing xps_cpus_map and num_tc

Accesses to dev->xps_cpus_map (when using dev->num_tc) should be
protected by the rtnl lock, like we do for netif_set_xps_queue. I didn't
see an actual bug being triggered, but let's be safe here and take the
rtnl lock while accessing the map in sysfs.
