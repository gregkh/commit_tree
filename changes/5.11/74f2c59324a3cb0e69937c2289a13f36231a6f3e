Input: adp5589-keys - use devm_gpiochip_add_data() for gpios

This change makes use of the devm_gpiochip_add_data() function. With this
the gpiochip_remove() function can be removed, and the
adp5589_gpio_remove() function as well.

The kpad->export_gpio variable is also redundant now, and has been removed.
