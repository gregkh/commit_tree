bpf: Allow empty module BTFs

Some modules don't declare any new types and end up with an empty BTF,
containing only valid BTF header and no types or strings sections. This
currently causes BTF validation error. There is nothing wrong with such BTF,
so fix the issue by allowing module BTFs with no types or strings.
