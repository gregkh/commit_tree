hwmon: (corsair-psu) fix unintentional sign extension issue

The shifting of the u8 integer data[3] by 24 bits to the left will
be promoted to a 32 bit signed int and then sign-extended to a
long. In the event that the top bit of data[3] is set then all
then all the upper 32 bits of a 64 bit long end up as also being
set because of the sign-extension. Fix this by casting data[3] to
a long before the shift.
