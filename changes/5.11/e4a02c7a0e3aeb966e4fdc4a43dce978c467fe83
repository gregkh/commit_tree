platform/surface: SURFACE_PLATFORMS should depend on ACPI

All Microsoft Surface platform-specific device drivers depend on ACPI,
but the gatekeeper symbol SURFACE_PLATFORMS does not.  Hence when the
user is configuring a kernel without ACPI support, he is still asked
about Microsoft Surface drivers, even though this question is
irrelevant.

Fix this by moving the dependency on ACPI from the individual driver
symbols to SURFACE_PLATFORMS.
