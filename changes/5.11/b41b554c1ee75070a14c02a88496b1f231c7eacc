s390/qeth: fix locking for discipline setup / removal

Due to insufficient locking, qeth_core_set_online() and
qeth_dev_layer2_store() can run in parallel, both attempting to load &
setup the discipline (and stepping on each other toes along the way).
A similar race can also occur between qeth_core_remove_device() and
qeth_dev_layer2_store().

Access to .discipline is meant to be protected by the discipline_mutex,
so add/expand the locking in qeth_core_remove_device() and
qeth_core_set_online().
Adjust the locking in qeth_l*_remove_device() accordingly, as it's now
handled by the callers in a consistent manner.

Based on an initial patch by Ursula Braun.
