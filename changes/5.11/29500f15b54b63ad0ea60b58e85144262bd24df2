kbuild: fix CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS build for ppc64

Stephen Rothwell reported a build error on ppc64 when
CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS is enabled.

Jessica Yu pointed out the cause of the error with the reference to the
ppc64 ELF ABI:
  "Symbol names with a dot (.) prefix are reserved for holding entry
   point addresses. The value of a symbol named ".FN", if it exists,
   is the entry point of the function "FN".

As it turned out, CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS has never worked for ppc64,
but this issue has been unnoticed until recently because this option
depends on !UNUSED_SYMBOLS hence is disabled by all{mod,yes}config.
(Then, it was uncovered by another patch removing UNUSED_SYMBOLS.)

Removing the dot prefix in scripts/gen_autoksyms.sh fixes the issue.
Please note it must be done before 'sort -u' because modules have
both ._mcount and _mcount undefined when CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER=y.
