net: add annotation for sock_{lock,unlock}_fast

The static checker is fooled by the non-static locking scheme
implemented by the mentioned helpers.
Let's make its life easier adding some unconditional annotation
so that the helpers are now interpreted as a plain spinlock from
sparse.

v1 -> v2:
 - add __releases() annotation to unlock_sock_fast()
