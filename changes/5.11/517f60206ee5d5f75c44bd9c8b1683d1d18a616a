um: Increase stack frame size threshold for signal.c

The signal.c can't use heap for bit data located on stack. However,
by default a compiler warns us about overstepping stack frame size
threshold:

arch/um/os-Linux/signal.c: In function ‘sig_handler_common’:
arch/um/os-Linux/signal.c:51:1: warning: the frame size of 2960 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
   51 | }
      | ^
arch/um/os-Linux/signal.c: In function ‘timer_real_alarm_handler’:
arch/um/os-Linux/signal.c:95:1: warning: the frame size of 2960 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
    95 | }
       | ^

Due to above increase stack frame size threshold explicitly for signal.c
to avoid unnecessary warning.
