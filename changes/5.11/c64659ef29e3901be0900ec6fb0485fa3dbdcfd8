torture: Prevent jitter processes from delaying failed run

Even when the kernel panics and qemu dies, runs with jitter enabled will
continue uselessly until the jitter.sh processes terminate.  This can
be annoying if a planned one-hour run instead dies during boot.

This commit therefore kills the jitter.sh processes when the run ends
more than one minute prior to the termination time specified by the
kvm.sh --duration argument or its default.
