ASoC: mediatek: mt8192-mt6359: add format constraints for RT5682

MT8192 determines the I2S clock rates according to the sampling rates.

There is only 1 set of I2S in between MT8192 and RT5682.  If playing and
capturing via RT5682 in different sampling rates, the I2S data will be
corrupted.

Adds format constraints to the corresponding DAI links to make sure the
sampling rates are symmetric.
