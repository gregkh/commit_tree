ia64: fix build failure caused by memory model changes

The change of ia64's default memory model to SPARSEMEM causes defconfig
build to fail:

      |  ^~~~~

The error cause is the missing definition of PAGE_SHIFT in the calculation
of SECTION_SIZE_BITS.

Add include of <asm/page.h> to arch/ia64/include/asm/sparsemem.h to solve
the problem.
