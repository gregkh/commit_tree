platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Introduce TYPEC_STATUS

Make a call to the newly introduced EC_CMD_TYPEC_STATUS command.
Currently we just check to see if the SOP (port-partner) discovery was
done and emit a debug level print for it.

Subsequent patches will retrieve and parse the discovery data and fill
out the Type C connector class data structures.

Also check the EC_FEATURE_TYPEC_CMD feature flag at probe, and only call
the new TYPEC_STATUS command if the feature flag is supported.
