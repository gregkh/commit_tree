ubsan: implement __ubsan_handle_alignment_assumption

When building ARCH=mips 32r2el_defconfig with CONFIG_UBSAN_ALIGNMENT:

  ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: __ubsan_handle_alignment_assumption

Implement this for the kernel based on LLVM's
handleAlignmentAssumptionImpl because the kernel is not linked against
the compiler runtime.
