net/smc: Introduce SMCR get linkgroup command

Introduce get linkgroup command which loops through
all available SMCR linkgroups. It uses the SMC-R linkgroup
list as entry point, not the socket list, which makes
linkgroup diagnosis possible, in case linkgroup does not
contain active connections anymore.
