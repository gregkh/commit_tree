driver core: Fix device link device name collision

The device link device's name was of the form:
<supplier-dev-name>--<consumer-dev-name>

This can cause name collision as reported here [1] as device names are
not globally unique. Since device names have to be unique within the
bus/class, add the bus/class name as a prefix to the device names used to
construct the device link device name.

So the devuce link device's name will be of the form:
<supplier-bus-name>:<supplier-dev-name>--<consumer-bus-name>:<consumer-dev-name>
