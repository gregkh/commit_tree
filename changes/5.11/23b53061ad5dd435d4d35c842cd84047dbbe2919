kbuild: doc: fix 'List directories to visit when descending' section

Fix stale information:

 - Fix the section number in the reference from 6.4 to 7.4.

 - Remove init-y and net-y. They were removed by commit 23febe375d94
   ("kbuild: merge init-y into core-y") and commit 95fb6317b3ab
   ("kbuild: merge net-y and virt-y into drivers-y"), respectively.

 - Update the example because arch/sparc64/Makefile does not exit.
