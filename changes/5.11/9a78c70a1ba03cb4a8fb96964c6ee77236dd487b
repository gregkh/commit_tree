s390/decompressor: add decompressor_printk

The decompressor does not have any special debug means. Running the
kernel under qemu with gdb is helpful but tedious exercise if done
repeatedly. It is also not applicable to debugging under LPAR and z/VM.

One special thing which stands out is a working sclp_early_printk,
which could be used once the kernel switches to 64-bit addressing mode.

But sclp_early_printk does not provide any string formating capabilities.
Formatting and printing string without printk-alike function is a
not fun. The lack of printk-alike function means people would save up on
testing and introduce more bugs.

So, finally, provide decompressor_printk function, which fits on one
screen and trades features for simplicity.

It only supports "%s", "%x" and "%lx" specifiers and zero padding for
hex values.
