scsi: lpfc: Use generic power management

Drivers should do only device-specific jobs. But in general, drivers using
legacy PCI PM framework for .suspend()/.resume() have to manage many PCI
PM-related tasks themselves which can be done by PCI Core itself. This
brings extra load on the driver and it directly calls PCI helper functions
to handle them.

Switch to the new generic framework by updating function signatures and
define a "struct dev_pm_ops" variable to bind PM callbacks. Also, remove
unnecessary calls to the PCI Helper functions along with the legacy
.suspend & .resume bindings.
