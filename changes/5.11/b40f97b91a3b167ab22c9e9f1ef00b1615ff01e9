net: lapb: Decrease the refcount of "struct lapb_cb" in lapb_device_event

In lapb_device_event, lapb_devtostruct is called to get a reference to
an object of "struct lapb_cb". lapb_devtostruct increases the refcount
of the object and returns a pointer to it. However, we didn't decrease
the refcount after we finished using the pointer. This patch fixes this
problem.
