mm, page_poison: remove CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO

CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO uses the zero pattern instead of 0xAA.  It was
introduced by commit 1414c7f4f7d7 ("mm/page_poisoning.c: allow for zero
poisoning"), noting that using zeroes retains the benefit of sanitizing
content of freed pages, with the benefit of not having to zero them again
on alloc, and the downside of making some forms of corruption (stray
writes of NULLs) harder to detect than with the 0xAA pattern.  Together
with CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_NO_SANITY it made possible to sanitize the
contents on free without checking it back on alloc.

These days we have the init_on_free() option to achieve sanitization with
zeroes and to save clearing on alloc (and without checking on alloc).
Arguably if someone does choose to check the poison for corruption on
alloc, the savings of not clearing the page are secondary, and it makes
sense to always use the 0xAA poison pattern.  Thus, remove the
CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO option for being redundant.
