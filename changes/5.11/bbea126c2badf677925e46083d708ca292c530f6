nexthop: Remove in-kernel route notifications when nexthop changes

Remove in-kernel route notifications when the configuration of their
nexthop changes.

These notifications are unnecessary because the route still uses the
same nexthop ID. A separate notification for the nexthop change itself
is now sent in the nexthop notification chain.
