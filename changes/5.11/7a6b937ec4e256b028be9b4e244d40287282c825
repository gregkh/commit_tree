ASoC: sun8i-codec: Generalize AIF clock control

The AIF clock control register has the same layout for all three AIFs.
The only difference between them is that AIF3 is missing some fields. We
can reuse the same register field definitions for all three registers,
and use the DAI ID to select the correct register address.
