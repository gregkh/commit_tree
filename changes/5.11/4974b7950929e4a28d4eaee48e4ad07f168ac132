ALSA: usb-audio: Don't call usb_set_interface() at trigger callback

The PCM trigger callback is atomic, hence we must not call a function
like usb_set_interface() there.  Calling it from there would lead to a
kernel Oops.

Fix it by moving the usb_set_interface() call to set_sync_endpoint().

Also, apply the snd_usb_set_interface_quirk() for consistency, too.
