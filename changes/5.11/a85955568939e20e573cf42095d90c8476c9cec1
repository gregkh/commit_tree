drm/gem: Store client buffer mappings as struct dma_buf_map

Kernel DRM clients now store their framebuffer address in an instance
of struct dma_buf_map. Depending on the buffer's location, the address
refers to system or I/O memory.

Callers of drm_client_buffer_vmap() receive a copy of the value in
the call's supplied arguments. It can be accessed and modified with
dma_buf_map interfaces.

v6:
	* don't call page_to_phys() on framebuffers in I/O memory;
	  warn instead (Daniel)
