x86/build: Remove -m16 workaround for unsupported versions of GCC

Revert the following two commits:

  de3accdaec88 ("x86, build: Build 16-bit code with -m16 where possible")
  a9cfccee6604 ("x86, build: Change code16gcc.h from a C header to an assembly header")

Since

  0bddd227f3dc ("Documentation: update for gcc 4.9 requirement")

the minimum supported version of GCC is gcc-4.9. It's now safe to remove
this code.
