i2c: tegra: Create i2c_writesl_vi() to use with VI I2C for filling TX FIFO

VI I2C controller has known hardware bug where immediate multiple
writes to TX_FIFO register gets stuck.

Recommended software work around is to read I2C register after
each write to TX_FIFO register to flush out the data.

This patch implements this work around for VI I2C controller.
