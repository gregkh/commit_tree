tracing: Use pause-on-trace with the latency tracers

Eaerlier, tracing was disabled when reading the trace file. This behavior
was changed with:

commit 06e0a548bad0 ("tracing: Do not disable tracing when reading the
trace file").

This doesn't seem to work with the latency tracers.

The above mentioned commit dit not only change the behavior but also added
an option to emulate the old behavior. The idea with this patch is to
enable this pause-on-trace option when the latency tracers are used.
