ath11k: pci: read select_window register to ensure write is finished

Just when resume from WoW, the write to select_window doesn't take
effect immediately, so read the register again to ensure the write
operation is finished.

Another change is to reset select_window to ZERO because this
register isn't restored after WoW, so the content of this register
becomes ZERO too.
