bridge: cfm: Kernel space implementation of CFM. CCM frame RX added.

This is the third commit of the implementation of the CFM protocol
according to 802.1Q section 12.14.

Functionality is extended with CCM frame reception.
The MEP instance now contains CCM based status information.
Most important is the CCM defect status indicating if correct
CCM frames are received with the expected interval.
