bpftool: Fix compilation failure for net.o with older glibc

For older glibc ~2.17, #include'ing both linux/if.h and net/if.h
fails due to complaints about redefinition of interface flags:

  CC       net.o
In file included from net.c:13:0:
/usr/include/linux/if.h:71:2: error: redeclaration of enumerator ‘IFF_UP’
  IFF_UP    = 1<<0,  /* sysfs */
  ^
/usr/include/net/if.h:44:5: note: previous definition of ‘IFF_UP’ was here
     IFF_UP = 0x1,  /* Interface is up.  */

The issue was fixed in kernel headers in [1], but since compilation
of net.c picks up system headers the problem can recur.

Dropping #include <linux/if.h> resolves the issue and it is
not needed for compilation anyhow.
