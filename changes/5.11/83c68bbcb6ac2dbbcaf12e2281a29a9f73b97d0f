btrfs: initialize fs_info::csum_size earlier in open_ctree

User reported that btrfs-progs misc-tests/028-superblock-recover fails:

      [TEST/misc]   028-superblock-recover
  unexpected success: mounted fs with corrupted superblock
  test failed for case 028-superblock-recover

The test case expects that a broken image with bad superblock will be
rejected to be mounted. However, the test image just passed csum check
of superblock and was successfully mounted.

Commit 55fc29bed8dd ("btrfs: use cached value of fs_info::csum_size
everywhere") replaces all calls to btrfs_super_csum_size by
fs_info::csum_size. The calls include the place where fs_info->csum_size
is not initialized. So btrfs_check_super_csum() passes because memcmp()
with len 0 always returns 0.

Fix it by caching csum size in btrfs_fs_info::csum_size once we know the
csum type in superblock is valid in open_ctree().
