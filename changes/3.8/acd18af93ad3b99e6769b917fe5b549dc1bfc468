OMAPDSS: add omapdss_version

Add new enum, omapdss_version, that is used to tell which DSS hardware

if the version is less or greater than something, but you need to check
for exact version match. In other words, this is invalid:

/* test if DSS is 3630 or earlier */
if (ver <= OMAPDSS_VER_OMAP3630)
