drbd: allow to select specific bitmap pages for writeout

We are about to allow several changes to the active set in one activity
log transaction. We have to write out the corresponding bitmap pages as
well, if changed.

Introduce drbd_bm_mark_for_writeout(), then re-use the existing bitmap
writeout path to submit all marked pages in one go.
