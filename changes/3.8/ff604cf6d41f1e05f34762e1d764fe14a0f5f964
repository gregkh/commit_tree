mm: hwpoison: fix action_result() to print out dirty/clean

action_result() fails to print out "dirty" even if an error occurred on
a dirty pagecache, because when we check PageDirty in action_result() it
was cleared after page isolation even if it's dirty before error
handling.  This can break some applications that monitor this message,
so should be fixed.

There are several callers of action_result() except page_action(), but
either of them are not for LRU pages but for free pages or kernel pages,
so we don't have to consider dirty or not for them.

Note that PG_dirty can be set outside page locks as described in commit
6746aff74da2 ("HWPOISON: shmem: call set_page_dirty() with locked
page"), so this patch does not completely closes the race window, but
just narrows it.
