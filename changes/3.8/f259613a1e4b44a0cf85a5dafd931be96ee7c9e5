NFS: avoid NULL dereference in nfs_destroy_server

In rare circumstances, nfs_clone_server() of a v2 or v3 server can get
an error between setting server->destory (to nfs_destroy_server), and
calling nfs_start_lockd (which will set server->nlm_host).

If this happens, nfs_clone_server will call nfs_free_server which
will call nfs_destroy_server and thence nlmclnt_done(NULL).  This
causes the NULL to be dereferenced.

So add a guard to only call nlmclnt_done() if ->nlm_host is not NULL.

The other guards there are irrelevant as nlm_host can only be non-NULL
if one of these flags are set - so remove those tests.  (Thanks to Trond
for this suggestion).

This is suitable for any stable kernel since 2.6.25.
