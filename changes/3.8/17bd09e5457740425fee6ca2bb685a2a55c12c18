ASoC: arizona: Add support for multiplexer with no associated mixer

The Asynchronous Sample Rate Converters on the wm5102/wm5110 have no
mixer attached to their input, but they do allow the input to be
selected from a number of sources via a multiplexer. Currently the
platform assumes the presence of 4 multiplexers and a mixer for each
block.

This patch adds support multiplexed single input blocks into the Arizona
platform.
