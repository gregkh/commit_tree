Bury the conditionals from kernel_thread/kernel_execve series

All architectures have
	CONFIG_GENERIC_KERNEL_THREAD
	CONFIG_GENERIC_KERNEL_EXECVE
	__ARCH_WANT_SYS_EXECVE
None of them have __ARCH_WANT_KERNEL_EXECVE and there are only two callers
of kernel_execve() (which is a trivial wrapper for do_execve() now) left.
Kill the conditionals and make both callers use do_execve().
