USB: ehci: make debug port in-use detection functional again

Debug port in-use determination must be done before the controller gets
reset the first time, i.e. before the call to ehci_setup() as of commit
1a49e2ac9651df7349867a5cf44e2c83de1046af. That commit effectively
rendered commit 9fa5780beea1274d498a224822397100022da7d4 useless.

While moving that code around, also fix the BAR determination - the
respective capability field is a 3- rather than a 2-bit one -, and use
PCI_CAP_ID_DBG instead of the literal 0x0a.

It's unclear to me whether the debug port functionality is important
enough to warrant fixing this in stable kernels too.
