EHCI: use the isochronous scheduling threshold

This patch (as1609) changes the way ehci-hcd uses the "Isochronous
Scheduling Threshold" in its calculations.  Until now the code has
ignored the threshold except for certain Intel PCI-based controllers.
This violates the EHCI spec.

The new code takes the threshold into account always, removing the
need for the fs_i_thresh quirk flag.  In addition it implements the
"full frame cache" setting more efficiently, moving forward only as
far as the next frame boundary instead of always moving forward 8
microframes.
