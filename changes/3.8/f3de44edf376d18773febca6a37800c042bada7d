irq: Set CPU affinity right on thread creation

As irq_thread_check_affinity is called ONLY inside the while loop in
the irq thread, the core affinity is set only when an interrupt
occurs. This patch sets the core affinity right after the irq thread
is created and before it waits for interrupts. In real-tiime targets
that do not typically change the core affinity of irqs during
run-time, this patch will save additional latency of an irq thread in
setting the core affinity during the first interrupt occurrence for
that irq.
