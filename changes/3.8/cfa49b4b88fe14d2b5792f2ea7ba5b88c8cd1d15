USB: ohci: merge ohci_finish_controller_resume with ohci_resume

Merge ohci_finish_controller_resume with ohci_resume as suggested by Alan
Stern. Since ohci_finish_controller_resume no longer exists, update the
various OHCI drivers to call ohci_resume() instead. Some drivers used to set
themselves the bit HCD_FLAG_HW_ACCESSIBLE, which is now handled by
ohci_resume().
