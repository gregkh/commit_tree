Bluetooth: Move channel response

The move response command includes a result code indicating
"pending", "success", or "failure" status.  A pending result is
received when the remote address is still setting up a physical link,
and will be followed by success or failure.  On success, logical link
setup will proceed.  On failure, the move is stopped.  The receiver of
a move channel response must always follow up by sending a move
channel confirm command.
