ARM: nomadik: switch over to using the FSMC driver

The Nomadik NAND driver is really just a subset of the existing
FSMC driver, so let's switch over to using that driver instead,
since it handles more variants of this chip. The callbacks for
setting up the chip is doing stuff now handled by the FSMC
driver.
