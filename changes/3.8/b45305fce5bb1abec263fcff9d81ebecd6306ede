drm/i915: Implement workaround for broken CS tlb on i830/845

Now that Chris Wilson demonstrated that the key for stability on early
gen 2 is to simple _never_ exchange the physical backing storage of
batch buffers I've tried a stab at a kernel solution. Doesn't look too
nefarious imho, now that I don't try to be too clever for my own good
any more.

v2: After discussing the various techniques, we've decided to always blit
batches on the suspect devices, but allow userspace to opt out of the
kernel workaround assume full responsibility for providing coherent
batches. The principal reason is that avoiding the blit does improve
performance in a few key microbenchmarks and also in cairo-trace
replays.

[danvet:
- Drop the hunk which uses HAS_BROKEN_CS_TLB to implement the ring
  wrap w/a. Suggested by Chris Wilson.
- Also add the ACTHD check from Chris Wilson for the error state
  dumping, so that we still catch batches when userspace opts out of
  the w/a.]
