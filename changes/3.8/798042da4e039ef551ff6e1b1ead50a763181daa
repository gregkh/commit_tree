powerpc: Add wrappers to enable/disable relocation on exceptions

These wrappers hide the parameters that have to be passed to H_SET_MODE
to enable/disable relocation on during exceptions.

As noted in the comments, since these have partition wide scope, they
may take some time to complete and must be periodically retried until
H_SUCCESS is returned.
