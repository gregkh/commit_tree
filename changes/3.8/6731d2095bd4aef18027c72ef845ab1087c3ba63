tcp: fix for zero packets_in_flight was too broad

There are transients during normal FRTO procedure during which
the packets_in_flight can go to zero between write_queue state
updates and firing the resulting segments out. As FRTO processing
occurs during that window the check must be more precise to
not match "spuriously" :-). More specificly, e.g., when
packets_in_flight is zero but FLAG_DATA_ACKED is true the problematic
branch that set cwnd into zero would not be taken and new segments
might be sent out later.
