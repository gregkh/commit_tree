ARM: tegra: move irammap.h to mach-tegra

Nothing outside mach-tegra uses this file, so there's no need for it to
be in <mach/>.

Since uncompress.h and debug-macro.S remain in include/mach, they need
to include "../../irammap.h" becaue of this change. Both these usages
will be removed shortly, when Tegra's DEBUG_LL implementation is updated
not to pass information through IRAM.
