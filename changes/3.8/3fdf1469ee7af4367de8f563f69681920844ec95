ALSA: hda - Don't overwrite the pin default configs

Since we keep the pin default config values anyway internally, we
don't have to set the values in the codec.  This patch removes the
code writing the pincfg values.

As a gratis bonus, we can remove also the code restoring the original
pincfg values at PM resume or module free.  This will give us more
benefit, as it can reduce the unnecessary power-up of codecs.

This won't change the driver functionality.  The only difference would
be that the codec proc file will show the original pincfg values
instead of the actually referred values.  The actually referred values
can be determined from sysfs *_pin_configs files.
(Also hda-emu was updated to follow this change.)
