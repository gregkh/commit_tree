ACPI: Check MSR valid bit before using P-state frequencies

To fix incorrect P-state frequencies which can happen on
some AMD systems f594065faf4f9067c2283a34619fc0714e79a98d
   "ACPI: Add fixups for AMD P-state figures"
introduced a quirk to obtain the correct values by reading
from AMD specific MSRs.

This did cause a regression when running a kernel using that
quirk under Xen which does (currently) not pass through MSR
reads to the HW. Instead the guest gets a 0 in return.
And this seems to cause a failure to initialize the ondemand
governour (hard to say for sure as all P-states appear to run
at the same frequency).

While this should also be fixed in the hypervisor (to allow
a guest to read that MSR), this patch is intended to work
around the issue in the meantime. In discussion it turned out
that indeed real HW/BIOSes may choose to not set the valid bit
and thus mark the P-state as invalid. So this could be considered
a fix for broken BIOSes that also works around the issue on Xen.
