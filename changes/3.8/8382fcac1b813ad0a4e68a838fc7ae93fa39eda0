pidns: Outlaw thread creation after unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)

The sequence:
unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)
clone(CLONE_THREAD|CLONE_SIGHAND|CLONE_VM)

Creates a new process in the new pid namespace without setting
pid_ns->child_reaper.  After forking this results in a NULL
pointer dereference.

Avoid this and other nonsense scenarios that can show up after
creating a new pid namespace with unshare by adding a new
check in copy_prodcess.
