OMAPDSS: DPI: fix crash with dpi_verify_dsi_pll()

If the DSI support has not been compiled in or the SoC doesn't have DSI
hardware, dpi_get_dsidev() returns NULL. This NULL is passed to
dpi_verify_dsi_pll() causing a crash. The bug was added with commit
0e8276ef75f5c7811b038d1d23b2b42c16efc5ac (OMAPDSS: DPI: always use DSI
PLL if available).

Fix this by checking if dsidev is NULL before calling
dpi_verify_dsi_pll().
