ARM: 7593/1: nommu: do not enable DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS when !CONFIG_MMU

Commit b9a50f74905a ("ARM: 7450/1: dcache: select DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS for
little-endian ARMv6+ CPUs") added support for word-at-time path
comparisons, relying on the ability to perform unaligned loads with
negligible performance impact in hardware.

For nommu configurations without MPU support, this is unpredictable and
so we should fall back to the byte-by-byte routines.
