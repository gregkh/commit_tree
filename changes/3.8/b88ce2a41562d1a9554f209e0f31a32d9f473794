ACPI / PM: Allow attach/detach routines to change device power states

Make it possible to ask the routines used for adding/removing devices
to/from the general ACPI PM domain, acpi_dev_pm_attach() and
acpi_dev_pm_detach(), respectively, to change the power states of
devices so that they are put into the full-power state automatically
by acpi_dev_pm_attach() and into the lowest-power state available
automatically by acpi_dev_pm_detach().
