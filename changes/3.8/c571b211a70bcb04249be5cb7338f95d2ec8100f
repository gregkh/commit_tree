Drivers: amba: remove __dev* attributes.

CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option.  As a result, the __dev*
markings need to be removed, as well as the use of CONFIG_HOTPLUG.

This patch does both, removing the use of CONFIG_HOTPLUG in the
amba/bus.c file, and __devinit and __devinitconst in the tegra-ahb.c
driver.
