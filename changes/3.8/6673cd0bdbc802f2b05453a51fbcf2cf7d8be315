s390/3215: partially revert tty close handling fix

Partially revert ae289dc1f "s390/3215: fix tty close handling", since this
leads sometimes to hanging agetty processes and therefore systems that get
stuck while starting.

This was magically fixed (bisected) by a common code patch from Alan Cox:
36b3c070 "tty: Move the handling of the tty release logic", however it was
unrelated.

Since the removed code worked for a decade, nobody knows anymore why it was
in there in the first place and debugging the observed hang is non-trivial
(at least for me :) ), let's just re-add the removed code before we see
other side effects.
