ima: support new kernel module syscall

With the addition of the new kernel module syscall, which defines two
arguments - a file descriptor to the kernel module and a pointer to a NULL
terminated string of module arguments - it is now possible to measure and
appraise kernel modules like any other file on the file system.

This patch adds support to measure and appraise kernel modules in an
extensible and consistent manner.

To support filesystems without extended attribute support, additional
patches could pass the signature as the first parameter.
