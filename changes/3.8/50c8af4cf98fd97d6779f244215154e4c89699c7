of: introduce for_each_matching_node_and_match()

The following pattern of code is tempting:

    for_each_matching_node(np, table) {
        match = of_match_node(table, np);

However, this results in iterating over table twice; the second time
inside of_match_node(). The implementation of for_each_matching_node()
already found the match, so this is redundant. Invent new function
of_find_matching_node_and_match() and macro
for_each_matching_node_and_match() to remove the double iteration,
thus transforming the above code to:

    for_each_matching_node_and_match(np, table, &match)
