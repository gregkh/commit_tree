rcu: Rename ->onofflock to ->orphan_lock

The ->onofflock field in the rcu_state structure at one time synchronized
CPU-hotplug operations for RCU.  However, its scope has decreased over time
so that it now only protects the lists of orphaned RCU callbacks.  This
commit therefore renames it to ->orphan_lock to reflect its current use.
