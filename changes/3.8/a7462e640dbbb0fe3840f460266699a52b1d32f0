staging:iio:adis16400: Remove now duplicated chip_table entry

The ADIS1360 and ADIS13605 are very similar and do have the same software
interface. The only difference is the contents of the PROD_ID register. Since we
now read the product id from the device name instead of the chip_info struct we
can use the same chip_table entry for both the ADIS1360 and ADIS13605.
