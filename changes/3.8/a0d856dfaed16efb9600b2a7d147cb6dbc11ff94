drbd: base completion and destruction of requests on ref counts

cherry-picked and adapted from drbd 9 devel branch

The logic for when to get or put a reference is in mod_rq_state().

To not get confused in the freeze/thaw respectively resend/restart
paths, or when cleaning up requests waiting for P_BARRIER_ACK, this
also introduces additional state flags:
RQ_COMPLETION_SUSP, and RQ_EXP_BARR_ACK.
