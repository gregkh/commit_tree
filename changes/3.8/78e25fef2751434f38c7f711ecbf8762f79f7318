ACPICA: Fix divergences of definition conflicts.

There are conflicts in the "acpi_device_id*" definitions between the
Linux and the ACPICA.  The definitions of acpi_device_id* in ACPICA
have been changed to the "acpi_pnp_device_id*".  This patch changes
the corresponding "acpica_device_id*" definitiions in the Linux.

This patch will not affect the generated vmlinx binary.
This will decrease 298 lines of 20120913 divergence.diff.
