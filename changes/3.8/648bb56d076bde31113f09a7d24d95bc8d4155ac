cgroup: lock cgroup_mutex in cgroup_init_subsys()

Make cgroup_init_subsys() grab cgroup_mutex while initializing a
subsystem so that all helpers and callbacks are called under the
context they expect.  This isn't strictly necessary as
cgroup_init_subsys() doesn't race with anybody but will allow adding
lockdep assertions.
