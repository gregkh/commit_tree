ARM: perf: allocate CPU PMU dynamically at probe time

Supporting multiple, heterogeneous CPU PMUs requires us to allocate the
arm_pmu structures dynamically as the devices are probed.

This patch removes the static structure definitions for each CPU PMU
type and instead passes pointers to the PMU-specific init functions.
