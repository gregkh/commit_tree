drbd: Finish requests that completed while IO was frozen

Requests of an acked epoch are stored on the barrier_acked_requests list. In
case the private bio of such a request completes while IO on the drbd device
is suspended [req_mod(completed_ok)] then the request stays there.

When thawing IO because the fence_peer handler returned, then we use
tl_clear() to apply the connection_lost_while_pending event to all requests
on the transfer-log and the barrier_acked_requests list.

Up to now the connection_lost_while_pending event was not applied
on requests on the barrier_acked_requests list. Fixed that.

I.e. now the connection_lost_while_pending and resend events are
applied to requests on the barrier_acked_requests list. For that
it is necessary that the resend event finishes (local only)
READS correctly.
