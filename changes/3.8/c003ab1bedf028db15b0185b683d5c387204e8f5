[media] rc-core: add separate defines for protocol bitmaps and numbers

The RC_TYPE_* defines are currently used both where a single protocol is
expected and where a bitmap of protocols is expected.

Functions like rc_keydown() and functions which add/remove entries to the
keytable want a single protocol. Future userspace APIs would also
benefit from numeric protocols (rather than bitmap ones). Keytables are
smaller if they can use a small(ish) integer rather than a bitmap.

Other functions or struct members (e.g. allowed_protos,
enabled_protocols, etc) accept multiple protocols and need a bitmap.

Using different types reduces the risk of programmer error. Using a
protocol enum whereever possible also makes for a more future-proof
user-space API as we don't need to worry about a sufficient number of
bits being available (e.g. in structs used for ioctl() calls).

The use of both a number and a corresponding bit is dalso one in e.g.
the input subsystem as well (see all the references to set/clear bit when
changing keytables for example).

This patch separate the different usages in preparation for
upcoming patches.

Where a single protocol is expected, enum rc_type is used; where one or more
protocol(s) are expected, something like u64 is used.

The patch has been rewritten so that the format of the sysfs "protocols"
file is no longer altered (at the loss of some detail). The file itself
should probably be deprecated in the future though.
