ARM: 7599/1: head: Remove boot-time HYP mode check for v5 and below

The kernel can only be entered on HYP mode on CPUs which actually
support it, i.e.  >= ARMv7.  pre-v6 platform support cannot coexist
in the same kernel as support for v7 and higher, so there is no
advantage in having the HYP mode check on pre-v6 hardware.

At least one pre-v6 board is known to fail when the HYP mode check
code is present, although the exact cause remains unknown and may
be unrelated.  [1]

This patch restores the old behaviour for pre-v6 platforms, whereby
the CPSR is forced directly to SVC mode with IRQs and FIQs masked.
All kernels capable of booting on v7 hardware will retain the
check, so this should not impair functionality.
