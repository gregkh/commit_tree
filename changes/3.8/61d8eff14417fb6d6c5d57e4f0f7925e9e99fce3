ACPI / memhotplug: bind the memory device when the driver is being loaded

We had introduced acpi_hotmem_initialized to avoid strange add_memory fail
message.  But the memory device may not be used by the kernel, and the
device should be bound when the driver is being loaded.  Remove
acpi_hotmem_initialized to allow that the device can be bound when the
driver is being loaded.
