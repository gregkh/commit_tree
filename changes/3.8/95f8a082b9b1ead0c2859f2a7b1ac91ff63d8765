ACPI / driver core: Introduce struct acpi_dev_node and related macros

To avoid adding an ACPI handle pointer to struct device on
architectures that don't use ACPI, or generally when CONFIG_ACPI is
not set, in which cases that pointer is useless, define struct
acpi_dev_node that will contain the handle pointer if CONFIG_ACPI is
set and will be empty otherwise and use it to represent the ACPI
device node field in struct device.

In addition to that define macros for reading and setting the ACPI
handle of a device that don't generate code when CONFIG_ACPI is
unset.  Modify the ACPI subsystem to use those macros instead of
referring to the given device's ACPI handle directly.
