libceph: init osd->o_node in create_osd()

The red-black node node in the ceph osd structure is not initialized
in create_osd().  Because this node can be the subject of a
RB_EMPTY_NODE() call later on, we should ensure the node is
initialized properly for that.  Add a call to RB_CLEAR_NODE()
initialize it.
