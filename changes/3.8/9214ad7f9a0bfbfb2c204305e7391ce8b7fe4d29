mac80211: call driver method when restart completes

When the driver requests a restart (reconfiguration) it
gets all the normal method calls, but can't really tell
why they're happening. Call a new restart_complete op
in the driver when the restart completes, so it could
keep its own state about the restart and clear it there.
