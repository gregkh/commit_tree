drbd: fix various disconnecting races

If an admin requests disconnect at a time when the state handling
already disconnects/reconnects, there have been some races.

Make sure to always really stop the network threads before
returning success for disconnect. Do not pretend successfull
forced disconnect, if the state handling returned an error.

Return success from drbd_adm_down() only after all threads are finished.
