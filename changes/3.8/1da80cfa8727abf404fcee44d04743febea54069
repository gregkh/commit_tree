drm/radeon: fix a rare case of double kfree

If one (but not both) allocations of p->chunks[].kpage[]
in radeon_cs_parser_init fail, the error path will free
the successfully allocated page, but leave a stale pointer
value in the kpage[] field. This will later cause a
double-free when radeon_cs_parser_fini is called.
This patch fixes the issue by forcing both pointers to NULL
after kfree in the error path.

The circumstances under which the problem happens are very
rare. The card must be AGP and the system must run out of
kmalloc area just at the right time so that one allocation
succeeds, while the other fails.
