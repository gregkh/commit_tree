aoe: allow user to disable target failure timeout

With this change, the aoe driver treats the value zero as special for
the aoe_deadsecs module parameter.  Normally, this value specifies the
number of seconds during which the driver will continue to attempt
retransmits to an unresponsive AoE target.  After aoe_deadsecs has
elapsed, the aoe driver marks the aoe device as "down" and fails all
I/O.

The new meaning of an aoe_deadsecs of zero is for the driver to
retransmit commands indefinitely.
