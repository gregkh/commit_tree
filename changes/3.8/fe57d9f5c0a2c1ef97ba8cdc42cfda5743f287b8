mac80211: track whether to use channel contexts

Depending on the driver, channel contexts may be used or
not. If they are used, the driver must have support for
hardware scan and remain-on-channel; otherwise the driver
must not advertise support for multiple channels.

Also prohibit WDS type interfaces when channel contexts
are to be used as there's no clear definition of which
channel they use.
