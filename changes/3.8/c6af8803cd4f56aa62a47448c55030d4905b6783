ext4: don't verify checksums of dx non-leaf nodes during fallback scan

During a directory entry lookup of a hashed directory, if the
hash-based lookup functions fail and we fall back to a linear scan,
don't try to verify the dirent checksum on the internal nodes of the
hash tree because they don't store a checksum in a hidden dirent like
the leaf nodes do.
