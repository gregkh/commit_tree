dm: introduce per_bio_data

Introduce a field per_bio_data_size in struct dm_target.

Targets can set this field in the constructor. If a target sets this
field to a non-zero value, "per_bio_data_size" bytes of auxiliary data
are allocated for each bio submitted to the target. These data can be
used for any purpose by the target and help us improve performance by
removing some per-target mempools.

Per-bio data is accessed with dm_per_bio_data. The
argument data_size must be the same as the value per_bio_data_size in
dm_target.

If the target has a pointer to per_bio_data, it can get a pointer to
the bio with dm_bio_from_per_bio_data() function (data_size must be the
same as the value passed to dm_per_bio_data).
