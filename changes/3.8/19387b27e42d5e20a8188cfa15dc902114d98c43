ACPI / memory-hotplug: add memory offline code to acpi_memory_device_remove()

The memory device can be removed by 2 ways:
 1. send eject request by SCI
 2. echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/PNP0C80:XX/eject

In the 1st case, acpi_memory_disable_device() will be called.
In the 2nd case, acpi_memory_device_remove() will be called.
acpi_memory_device_remove() will also be called when we unbind the
memory device from the driver acpi_memhotplug or a driver initialization
fails.

acpi_memory_disable_device() has already implemented a code which
offlines memory and releases acpi_memory_info struct. But
acpi_memory_device_remove() has not implemented it yet.

So the patch move offlining memory and releasing acpi_memory_info struct
codes to a new function acpi_memory_remove_memory(). And it is used by both
acpi_memory_device_remove() and acpi_memory_disable_device().
