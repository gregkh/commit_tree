netfilter: nf_conntrack: fix BUG_ON while removing nf_conntrack with netns

canqun zhang reported that we're hitting BUG_ON in the
nf_conntrack_destroy path when calling kfree_skb while
rmmod'ing the nf_conntrack module.

Currently, the nf_ct_destroy hook is being set to NULL in the
destroy path of conntrack.init_net. However, this is a problem
since init_net may be destroyed before any other existing netns
(we cannot assume any specific ordering while releasing existing
netns according to what I read in recent emails).

Thanks to Gao feng for initial patch to address this issue.
