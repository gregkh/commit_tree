SUNRPC: When changing the queue priority, ensure that we change the owner

This fixes a livelock in the xprt->sending queue where we end up never
making progress on lower priority tasks because sleep_on_priority()
keeps adding new tasks with the same owner to the head of the queue,
and priority bumps mean that we keep resetting the queue->owner to
whatever task is at the head of the queue.

Regression introduced by commit c05eecf636101dd4347b2d8fa457626bf0088e0a
(SUNRPC: Don't allow low priority tasks to pre-empt higher priority ones).
