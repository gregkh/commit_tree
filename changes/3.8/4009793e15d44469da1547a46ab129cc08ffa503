drivers: cma: represent physical addresses as phys_addr_t

This commit changes the CMA early initialization code to use phys_addr_t
for representing physical addresses instead of unsigned long.

Without this change, among other things, dma_declare_contiguous() simply
discards any memory regions whose address is not representable as unsigned
long.

This is a problem on 32-bit PAE machines where unsigned long is 32-bit
but physical address space is larger.
