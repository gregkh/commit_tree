of serial port driver - add clk_get_rate() support

Currently this driver expects the clock-frequency attribute. This
patch allows getting clock-frequency through clk driver API
clk_get_rate() if clock-frequency attribute is not defined.

So in the device bindings for serial device, one can add clocks
phandle to refer to the clk device to get the rate.
