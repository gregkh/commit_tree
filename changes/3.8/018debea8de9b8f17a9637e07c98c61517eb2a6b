dm thin: emit ignore_discard in status when discards disabled

If "ignore_discard" is specified when creating the thin pool device then
discard support is disabled for that device.  The pool device's status
should reflect this fact rather than stating "no_discard_passdown"
(which implies discards are enabled but passdown is disabled).
