libceph: fix protocol feature mismatch failure path

We should not set con->state to CLOSED here; that happens in
ceph_fault() in the caller, where it first asserts that the state
is not yet CLOSED.  Avoids a BUG when the features don't match.

Since the fail_protocol() has become a trivial wrapper, replace
calls to it with direct calls to reset_connection().
