ALSA: hda - add mute LED for HP Pavilion 17 (Realtek codec)

The mute LED is in this case connected to the Mic1 VREF.

The machine also exposes the following string in BIOS:
"HP_Mute_LED_0_A", so if more machines are coming, it probably
makes sense to try to do something more generic, like for the
IDT codec.
