KVM: x86: Add code to track call origin for msr assignment

In order to track who initiated the call (host or guest) to modify an msr
value I have changed function call parameters along the call path. The
specific change is to add a struct pointer parameter that points to (index,
data, caller) information rather than having this information passed as
individual parameters.

The initial use for this capability is for updating the IA32_TSC_ADJUST msr
while setting the tsc value. It is anticipated that this capability is
useful for other tasks.
