libceph: remove 'osdtimeout' option

This would reset a connection with any OSD that had an outstanding
request that was taking more than N seconds.  The idea was that if the
OSD was buggy, the client could compensate by resending the request.

In reality, this only served to hide server bugs, and we haven't
actually seen such a bug in quite a while.  Moreover, the userspace
client code never did this.

More importantly, often the request is taking a long time because the
OSD is trying to recover, or overloaded, and killing the connection
and retrying would only make the situation worse by giving the OSD
more work to do.
