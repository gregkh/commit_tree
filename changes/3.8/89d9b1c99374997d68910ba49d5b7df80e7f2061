mfd: db8500-prcmu: Fix irqdomain usage

This fixes two issues with the DB8500 PRCMU irqdomain:
- You have to state the irq base 0 to get a linear domain
  for the DT case from irq_domain_add_simple()
- The irqdomain was not used to translate the initial irq
  request using irq_create_mapping() making the linear
  case fail as it was lacking a proper descriptor.

I took this opportunity to fix two lines of whitespace
errors in related code as I was anyway messing around with
it.
