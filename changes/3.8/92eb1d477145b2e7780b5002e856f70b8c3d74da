openvswitch: Use RCU callback when detaching netdevices.

Currently, each time a device is detached from an OVS datapath
we call synchronize RCU before freeing associated data structures.
However, if a bridge is deleted (which detaches all ports) when
many devices are connected then there can be a long delay.  This
switches to use call_rcu() to group the cost together.
