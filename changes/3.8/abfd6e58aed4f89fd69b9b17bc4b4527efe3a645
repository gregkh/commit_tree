rcu: Fix comment about _rcu_barrier()/orphanage exclusion

In the old days, _rcu_barrier() acquired ->onofflock to exclude
rcu_send_cbs_to_orphanage(), which allowed the latter to avoid memory
barriers in callback handling.  However, _rcu_barrier() recently started
doing get_online_cpus() to lock out CPU-hotplug operations entirely, which
means that the comment in rcu_send_cbs_to_orphanage() that talks about
->onofflock is now obsolete.  This commit therefore fixes the comment.
