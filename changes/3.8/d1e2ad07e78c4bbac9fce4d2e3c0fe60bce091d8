checkpatch: add --strict test for switch/default missing break

switch default case is sometimes written as "default:;".  This can cause
new cases added below the default to be defective.

Suggest adding a break; after empty default cases to avoid fallthrough
defects.

Fixed indentation in the other semicolon test above it.
