memcg: fix typo in kmemcg cache walk macro

The macro for_each_memcg_cache_index contains a silly yet potentially
deadly mistake.  Although the macro parameter is _idx, the loop tests
are done over i, not _idx.

This hasn't generated any problems so far, because all users use i as a
loop index.  However, while playing with an extension of the code I
ended using another loop index and the compiler was quick to complain.

Unfortunately, this is not the kind of thing that testing reveals =(
