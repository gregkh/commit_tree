igb: Move the calls to set the Tx and Rx queues into igb_open

This change helps to address locking issues seen with
netif_set_real_num_tx_queues and netif_set_real_num_rx_queues when used in
the igb_set_interrupt_capability function.  To resolve these locking issues
I have moved the two function calls into __igb_open so that they can be
called while the RTNL lock is held.

An added advantage to this is that the number of queues is not updated
until the last possible moment so if there are any issues in allocating
MSI-X interrupts or resources for the rings we have time to change the
values prior to updating the netdev.
