ALSA: hda/hdmi - Work around "alsactl restore" errors

When "alsactl restore" is performed on HDMI codecs, it tries to
restore the channel map value since the channel map controls are
writable.  But hdmi_chmap_ctl_put() returns -EBADFD when no PCM stream
is assigned yet, and this results in an error message from alsactl.
Although the error is harmless, it's certainly ugly and can be
regarded as a regression.

As a workaround, this patch changes the return code in such a case to
be zero for making others happy.  (A slight excuse is: when the chmap
is changed through the proper alsa-lib API, the PCM status is checked
there anyway, so we don't have to be too strict in the kernel side.)
