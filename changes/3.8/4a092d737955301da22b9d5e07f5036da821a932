ext4: rationalize ext4_extents.h inclusion

Previously, ext4_extents.h was being included at the end of ext4.h,
which was bad for a number of reasons: (a) it was not being included
in the expected place, and (b) it caused the header to be included
multiple times.  There were #ifdef's to prevent this from causing any
problems, but it still was unnecessary.

By moving the function declarations that were in ext4_extents.h to
ext4.h, which is standard practice for where the function declarations
for the rest of ext4.h can be found, we can remove ext4_extents.h from
being included in ext4.h at all, and then we can only include
ext4_extents.h where it is needed in ext4's source files.

It should be possible to move a few more things into ext4.h, and
further reduce the number of source files that need to #include
ext4_extents.h, but that's a cleanup for another day.
