ACPI / memhotplug: deal with eject request in hotplug queue

The memory device can be removed by 2 ways:
 1. send eject request by SCI
 2. echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/PNP0C80:XX/eject

We handle the 1st case in the module acpi_memhotplug, and handle
the 2nd case in ACPI eject notification. This 2 events may happen
at the same time, so we may touch acpi_memory_device.res_list at
the same time. This patch reimplements memory-hotremove support
through an ACPI eject notification. Now the memory device is
offlined and hotremoved only in the function acpi_memory_device_remove()
which is protected by device_lock().
