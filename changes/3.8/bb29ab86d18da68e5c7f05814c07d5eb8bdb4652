Staging: ipack/bridges/tpci200: change tpci200_slot->*_phys type.

Previously the *_phys fields were of type ipack_addr_space, which use
void pointers to refer to memory addresses.  Since the *_phys fields
refer to unmapped memory, this is not correct.  Introduce a new struct
ipack_region (which uses phys_addr_t to refer to the start of a region)
and use that as a replacement for struct ipack_addr_space.

struct ipack_region is defined in ipack.h because it is planned to later
expose the physical addressed to the IPack Module drivers.
