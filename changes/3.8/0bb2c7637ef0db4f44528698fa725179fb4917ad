mm/page_alloc.c: remove duplicate check

While allocating pages using buddy allocator, the compound page is
probably split up to free pages.  Under these circumstances, the compound
page should be destroyed by destroy_compound_page().  However, there is a
duplicate check to judge if the page is compound.

Remove the duplicate check since the compound_order() returns 0 when the
page doesn't have PG_head set in destroy_compound_page().  That is to say,
destroy_compound_page() needn't check PageHead().
