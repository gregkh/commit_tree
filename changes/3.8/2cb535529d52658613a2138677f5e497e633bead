mmc: mxcmmc: fix SD cards not being detected sometimes.

When a SD card is initialized some data transfers of 64 and 8 bytes
are issued. It seems the DMA has some problems dealing with these kind
of "short" transfers, leading sometimes to the SD card not being detected.

In order to solve this problem, do not use DMA for transfer sizes lower
than the sector size.
