virtio-blk: Don't free ida when disk is in use

When a file system is mounted on a virtio-blk disk, we then remove it
and then reattach it, the reattached disk gets the same disk name and
ids as the hot removed one.

This leads to very nasty effects - mostly rendering the newly attached
device completely unusable.

Trying what happens when I do the same thing with a USB device, I saw
that the sd node simply doesn't get free'd when a device gets forcefully
removed.

Imitate the same behavior for vd devices. This way broken vd devices
simply are never free'd and newly attached ones keep working just fine.
