bfin_mac: replace sys time stamps with raw ones instead.

This patch replaces the sys time stamps and timecompare code with simple
raw hardware time stamps in nanosecond resolution. The only tricky bit is
to find a PTP Hardware Clock period slower than the input clock period
and a power of two.

Compile tested only.
