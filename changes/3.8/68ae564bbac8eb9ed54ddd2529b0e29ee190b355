mm, memcg: avoid unnecessary function call when memcg is disabled

While profiling numa/core v16 with cgroup_disable=memory on the command
line, I noticed mem_cgroup_count_vm_event() still showed up as high as
0.60% in perftop.

This occurs because the function is called extremely often even when memcg
is disabled.

To fix this, inline the check for mem_cgroup_disabled() so we avoid the
unnecessary function call if memcg is disabled.
