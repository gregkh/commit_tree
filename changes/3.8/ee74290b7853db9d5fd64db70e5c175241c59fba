USB: EHCI: fix timer bug affecting port resume

This patch (as1652) fixes a long-standing bug in ehci-hcd.  The driver
relies on status polls to know when to stop port-resume signalling.
It uses the root-hub status timer to schedule these status polls.  But
when the driver for the root hub is resumed, the timer is rescheduled
to go off immediately -- before the port is ready.  When this happens
the timer does not get re-enabled, which prevents the port resume from
finishing until some other event occurs.

The symptom is that when a new device is plugged in, it doesn't get
recognized or enumerated until lsusb is run or something else happens.

The solution is to re-enable the root-hub status timer after every
status poll while a port resume is in progress.

This bug hasn't surfaced before now because we never used to try to
suspend the root hub in the middle of a port resume (except by
coincidence).
