ASoC: fsi: add master clock control functions

Current FSI driver required set_rate() platform callback function
to set audio clock if it was master mode,
because it seemed that CPG/FSI-DIV clocks calculation depend on
platform/board/cpu.
But it was calculable regardless of platform.
This patch supports audio clock calculation method,
but the sampling rate under 32kHz is not supported at this point.
Old type set_rate() is still supported now,
but it will be deleted on next version
