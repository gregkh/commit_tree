drm/ttm: Optimize reservation slightly

Reservation locking currently always takes place under the LRU spinlock.
Hence, strictly there is no need for an atomic_cmpxchg call; we can use
atomic_read followed by atomic_write since nobody else will ever reserve
without the lru spinlock held.
At least on Intel this should remove a locked bus cycle on successful
reserve.

Note that thit commit may be obsoleted by the cross-device reservation work.
