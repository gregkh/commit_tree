mmc: Limit MMC speed to 52MHz if not HS200

If "caps2" host capabilities does not indicate support for MMC
HS200, don't allow clock speeds >52MHz. Currently, for MMC, the
clock speed is set to the lesser of the max speed the eMMC module
supports (card->ext_csd.hs_max_dtr) or the max base clock of the
host controller (host->f_max based on BASE_CLK_FREQ in the host
CAPS register). This means that a host controller that doesn't
support HS200 mode but has a base clock of 100MHz and an eMMC module
that supports HS200 speeds will end up using a 100MHz clock.
