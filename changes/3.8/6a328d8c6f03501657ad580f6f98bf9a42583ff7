cgroup: net_cls: Rework update socket logic

The cgroup logic part of net_cls is very similar as the one in
net_prio. Let's stream line the net_cls logic with the net_prio one.

The net_prio update logic was changed by following commit (note there
were some changes necessary later on)

    net: netprio_cgroup: rework update socket logic

    Instead of updating the sk_cgrp_prioidx struct field on every send
    this only updates the field when a task is moved via cgroup
    infrastructure.

    This allows sockets that may be used by a kernel worker thread
    to be managed. For example in the iscsi case today a user can
    put iscsid in a netprio cgroup and control traffic will be sent
    with the correct sk_cgrp_prioidx value set but as soon as data
    is sent the kernel worker thread isssues a send and sk_cgrp_prioidx
    is updated with the kernel worker threads value which is the
    default case.

    It seems more correct to only update the field when the user
    explicitly sets it via control group infrastructure. This allows
    the users to manage sockets that may be used with other threads.

Since classid is now updated when the task is moved between the
cgroups, we don't have to call sock_update_classid() from various
places to ensure we always using the latest classid value.

[v2: Use iterate_fd() instead of open coding]
