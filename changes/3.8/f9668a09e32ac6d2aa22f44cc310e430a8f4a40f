xfs: fix sparse reported log CRC endian issue

Not a bug as such, just warning noise from the xlog_cksum()
returning a __be32 type when it should be returning a __le32 type.

Because the CRC always returns the calcuation LE format, even on BE
systems. So rather than always having to byte swap it everywhere and
have all the force casts and anootations for sparse, it seems simpler to
just make it a __le32 everywhere....
