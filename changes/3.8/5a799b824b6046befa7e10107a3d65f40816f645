sh: clkfwk: bugfix: sh_clk_div_enable() care sh_clk_div_set_rate() if div6

764f4e4e33d18cde4dcaf8a0d860b749c6d6d08b
(sh: clkfwk: Use shared sh_clk_div_enable/disable())
shared enable/disable funcions for div4/div6.
But new sh_clk_div_enable() didn't care sh_clk_div_set_rate()
which is required on div6 clock.
This patch fixes it.
