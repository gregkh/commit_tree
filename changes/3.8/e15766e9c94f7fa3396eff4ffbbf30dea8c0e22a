drbd: improvements to activate/deactivate multiple activity log extents

Recent commit drbd: get rid of bio_split, allow bios of "arbitrary" size
had a reference count leak: it only deactivated the first of several
activity log extents for intervals crossing extent boundaries.

This commit generalizes on bios spanning multiple activity log extents
in drbd_al_begin_io, and adds the necessary loop around lc_put in
drbd_al_complete_io as well.
