partitions: enable EFI/GPT support by default

The Kconfig currently enables MSDOS partitions by default because they
are assumed to be essential, but it's necessary to enable "advanced
partition selection" in order to get GPT support. IMO GPT partitions
are becoming common enought to deserve the same treatment MSDOS
partitions get.

(Side note: I got bit by a disk that had MSDOS and GPT partition
tables, but for some reason the MSDOS table was different from the
GPT one. I was stupid enought to disable "advanced partition
selection" in my .config, which disabled GPT partitioning and made
my btrfs pool unbootable because it couldn't find the partitions)
