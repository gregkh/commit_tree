wireless: add utility function to get P2P attribute

Parsing the P2P attributes can be tricky as their
contents can be split across multiple (vendor) IEs.
Thus, it's not possible to parse them like IEs (by
returning a pointer to the data.) Instead, provide
a function that copies the attribute data into a
caller-provided buffer and returns the size needed
(useful in case the buffer was too small.)
