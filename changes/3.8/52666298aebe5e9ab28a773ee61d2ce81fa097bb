mfd: vexpress-sysreg: Don't skip initialization on probe

The vexpress-sysreg driver does not have to be initialized
early, when the platform doesn't require this. Unfortunately
in such case it wasn't initialized correctly - master site
lookup and config bridge registration were missing. Fixed now.
