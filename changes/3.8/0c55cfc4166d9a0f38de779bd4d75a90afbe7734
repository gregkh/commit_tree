vfs: Allow unprivileged manipulation of the mount namespace.

- Add a filesystem flag to mark filesystems that are safe to mount as
  an unprivileged user.

- Add a filesystem flag to mark filesystems that don't need MNT_NODEV
  when mounted by an unprivileged user.

- Relax the permission checks to allow unprivileged users that have
  CAP_SYS_ADMIN permissions in the user namespace referred to by the
  current mount namespace to be allowed to mount, unmount, and move
  filesystems.
