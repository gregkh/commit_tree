NFSv4: Fix NFSv4 trunking discovery

If walking the list in nfs4[01]_walk_client_list fails, then the most
likely explanation is that the server dropped the clientid before we
actually managed to confirm it. As long as our nfs_client is the very
last one in the list to be tested, the caller can be assured that this
is the case when the final return value is NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID.
