efivarfs: Never return ENOENT from firmware

Files are created in efivarfs_create() before a corresponding variable
is created in the firmware. This leads to users being able to
read/write to the file without the variable existing in the
firmware. Reading a non-existent variable currently returns -ENOENT,
which is confusing because the file obviously *does* exist.

Convert EFI_NOT_FOUND into -EIO which is the closest thing to "error
while interacting with firmware", and should hopefully indicate to the
caller that the variable is in some uninitialised state.
