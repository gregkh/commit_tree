net/macb: Offset first RX buffer by two bytes

Make the ethernet frame payload word-aligned, possibly making the
memcpy into the skb a bit faster. This will be even more important
after we eliminate the copy altogether.

Also eliminate the redundant RX_OFFSET constant -- it has the same
definition and purpose as NET_IP_ALIGN.
