arm64: vdso: remove broken, redundant sequence counting for timezones

This patch is an arm64 version of ce73ec6db47a ("powerpc/vdso: Remove
redundant locking in update_vsyscall_tz()").

Timezone data is not protected, so the sequence counter is not required
to ensure consistency. Furthermore, having multiple paths updating the
counter leads to a race between update_vsyscall and update_vsyscall_tz,
so remove the timezone sequence counting from both the kernel and the
vdso.
