tty: Use raw spin lock to protect TTY ldisc administration

The global "normal" spin lock that guards the line discipline
administration is replaced by a raw spin lock. On a PREEMPT_RT system this
prevents unwanted scheduling overhead around the line discipline administration.

On a 200 MHz AT91SAM9261 processor setup this fixes about 100us of scheduling
overhead on a TTY read or write call.
