drbd: differentiate between normal and forced detach

Aborting local requests (not waiting for completion from the lower level
disk) is dangerous: if the master bio has been completed to upper
layers, data pages may be re-used for other things already.
If local IO is still pending and later completes,
this may cause crashes or corrupt unrelated data.

Only abort local IO if explicitly requested.
Intended use case is a lower level device that turned into a tarpit,
not completing io requests, not even doing error completion.
