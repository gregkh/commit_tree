mmc: sdhci-pxav3: Add base clock quirk

Enable the quirk SDHCI_QUIRK_CAP_CLOCK_BASE_BROKEN since
SD_CAPABILITIES_1[15:8](BASE_FREQ) can't get correct base clock value.
It returns a fixed pre-set value like 200 on some sdhci-pxav3 based
platforms like MMP3 while return 0 on the other sdhci-pxav3 based
platforms.  So we enable the quirk and get the base clock via function
get_max_clock. Also add get_max_clock.
