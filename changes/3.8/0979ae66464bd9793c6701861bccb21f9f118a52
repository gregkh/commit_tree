checkpatch: Add --strict messages for blank lines around braces

Blank lines around braces are not unnecessary.  Emit a message on the use
of these blank lines only when using --strict.

int foo(int bar)
{

	something or other....

}

is generally written in the kernel as:

int foo(int bar)
{
	something or other...
}
