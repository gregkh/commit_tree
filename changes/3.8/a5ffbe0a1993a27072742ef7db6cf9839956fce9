rtlwifi: Fix scheduling while atomic bug

Kernel commits 41affd5 and 6539306 changed the locking in rtl_lps_leave()
from a spinlock to a mutex by doing the calls indirectly from a work queue
to reduce the time that interrupts were disabled. This change was fine for
most systems; however a scheduling while atomic bug was reported in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903881. The backtrace indicates
that routine rtl_is_special(), which calls rtl_lps_leave() in three places
was entered in atomic context. These direct calls are replaced by putting a
request on the appropriate work queue.
