i2c: s3c2410: Add fix for i2c suspend/resume

The I2C driver makes a gpio_request during initialization. This request
happens again on resume and fails due to the earlier successful request.
Re-factor the code to only initialize the gpios during probe.

Errors on resume without this:
[   16.020000] s3c-i2c s3c2440-i2c.0: gpio [42] request failed
[   16.020000] s3c-i2c s3c2440-i2c.1: gpio [44] request failed
[   16.020000] s3c-i2c s3c2440-i2c.2: gpio [6] request failed
