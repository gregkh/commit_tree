drm/nouveau: fix init with agpgart-uninorth

Check that the AGP aperture can be mapped. This follows a similar change
done for Radeon (commit 365048ff, drm/radeon: AGP memory is only I/O if
the aperture can be mapped by the CPU.).

The patch fixes the following error seen on G5 iMac:

	nouveau E[     DRM] failed to create kernel channel, -12
