sched: Add an rq migration call-back to sched_class

Since we are now doing bottom up load accumulation we need explicit
notification when a task has been re-parented so that the old hierarchy can be
updated.

Adds: migrate_task_rq(struct task_struct *p, int next_cpu)

(The alternative is to do this out of __set_task_cpu, but it was suggested that
this would be a cleaner encapsulation.)
