dma: mv_xor: rename mv_xor_private to mv_xor_device

Now that mv_xor_device is no longer used to designate the per-channel
DMA devices, use it know to designate the XOR engine themselves
(currently composed of two XOR channels).

So, now we have the nice organization where:

 - mv_xor_device represents each XOR engine in the system
 - mv_xor_chan   represents each XOR channel of a given XOR engine
