net: calxedaxgmac: throw away overrun frames

The xgmac driver assumes 1 frame per descriptor. If a frame larger than
the descriptor's buffer size is received, the frame will spill over into
the next descriptor. So check for received frames that span more than one
descriptor and discard them. This prevents a crash if we receive erroneous
large packets.
