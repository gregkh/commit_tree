mm: allocate kernel pages to the right memcg

When a process tries to allocate a page with the __GFP_KMEMCG flag, the
page allocator will call the corresponding memcg functions to validate
the allocation.  Tasks in the root memcg can always proceed.

To avoid adding markers to the page - and a kmem flag that would
necessarily follow, as much as doing page_cgroup lookups for no reason,
whoever is marking its allocations with __GFP_KMEMCG flag is responsible
for telling the page allocator that this is such an allocation at
free_pages() time.  This is done by the invocation of
__free_accounted_pages() and free_accounted_pages().
