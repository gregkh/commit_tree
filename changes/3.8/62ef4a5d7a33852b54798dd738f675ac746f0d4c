ARM: EXYNOS: Make s3c_device_i2c0 always use id 0

This patch removes compatibility definitions added long time ago when
clock ids were used instead of devnames that were needed for platforms
with only one i2c controller with id -1 (some s3c24xx's).

Because currently devname field is used for matching device instances to
clocks and if no devname is provided (as in clock-s3c2412.c and
common-s3c2443.c for i2c clock, both in arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx) the clock
is being matched only by name, so s3c_device_i2c0 can always have id 0.

This patch solves the issue with i2c0 broken on boards where its the
only i2c controller used, tested on Origen.
