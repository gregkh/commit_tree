ARM: virt: simplify __hyp_stub_install epilog

__hyp_stub_install duplicates quite a bit of safe_svcmode_maskall
by forcing the CPU back to SVC. This is unnecessary, as
safe_svcmode_maskall is called just after.

Furthermore, the way we build SPSR_hyp is buggy as we fail to mask
the interrupts, leading to interesting behaviours on TC2 + UEFI.

The fix is to simply remove this code and rely on safe_svcmode_maskall
to do the right thing.
