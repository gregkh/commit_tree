PCI: Work around Stratus ftServer broken PCIe hierarchy (fix DMI check)

Commit 284f5f9 was intended to disable the "only_one_child()" optimization
on Stratus ftServer systems, but its DMI check is wrong.  It looks for
DMI_SYS_VENDOR that contains "ftServer", when it should look for
DMI_SYS_VENDOR containing "Stratus" and DMI_PRODUCT_NAME containing
"ftServer".

Tested on Stratus ftServer 6400.
