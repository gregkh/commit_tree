[media] media: mx1_camera: mark the driver BROKEN

The mx1_camera driver has been broken for a few release cycles since
commit 6bd0812 (dmaengine: imx-dma: merge old dma-v1.c with imx-dma.c).
It seems there is no one even compile tested it since then, as doing
so will end up with the following error.
  CC      drivers/media/platform/soc_camera/mx1_camera.o
In file included from drivers/media/platform/soc_camera/mx1_camera.c:44:0:
arch/arm/mach-imx/include/mach/dma-mx1-mx2.h:8:25: fatal error: mach/dma-v1.h: No such file or directory
It seems there is no one being interested in bringing it back to
work [1] so far.  Let's mark it BROKEN.
