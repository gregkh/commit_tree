ext4: refactor __ext4_check_dir_entry() to accept start and size

The __ext4_check_dir_entry() function() is used to check whether the
de is over the block boundary.  Now with inline data, it could be
within the block boundary while exceeds the inode size.  So check this
function to check the overflow more precisely.
