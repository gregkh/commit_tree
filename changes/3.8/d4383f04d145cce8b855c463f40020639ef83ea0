ipvs: API change to avoid rescan of IPv6 exthdr

Reduce the number of times we scan/skip the IPv6 exthdrs.

This patch contains a lot of API changes.  This is done, to avoid
repeating the scan of finding the IPv6 headers, via ipv6_find_hdr(),
which is called by ip_vs_fill_iph_skb().

Finding the IPv6 headers is done as early as possible, and passed on
as a pointer "struct ip_vs_iphdr *" to the affected functions.

This patch reduce/removes 19 calls to ip_vs_fill_iph_skb().

Notice, I have choosen, not to change the API of function
pointer "(*schedule)" (in struct ip_vs_scheduler) as it can be
used by external schedulers, via {un,}register_ip_vs_scheduler.
Only 4 out of 10 schedulers use info from ip_vs_iphdr*, and when
they do, they are only interested in iph->{s,d}addr.
