block: Avoid that request_fn is invoked on a dead queue

A block driver may start cleaning up resources needed by its
request_fn as soon as blk_cleanup_queue() finished, so request_fn
must not be invoked after draining finished. This is important
when blk_run_queue() is invoked without any requests in progress.
As an example, if blk_drain_queue() and scsi_run_queue() run in
parallel, blk_drain_queue() may have finished all requests after
scsi_run_queue() has taken a SCSI device off the starved list but
before that last function has had a chance to run the queue.
