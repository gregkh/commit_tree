SERIAL: omap: remove setting of EFR SCD bit

The SCD (special character detect) bit enables comparisons with XOFF2,
which we do not program.  As the XOFF2 character remains unprogrammed,
there's little point enabling this feature along with its associated
interrupt.  Remove this, and ensure that the SCD bit is cleared.
