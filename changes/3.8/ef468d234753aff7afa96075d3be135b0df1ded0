net: calxedaxgmac: ip align receive buffers

On gcc 4.7, we will get alignment traps in the ip stack if we don't align
the ip headers on receive. The h/w can support this, so use ip aligned
allocations.

Cut down the unnecessary padding on the allocation. The buffer can start on
any byte alignment, but the size including the begining offset must be 8
byte aligned. So the h/w buffer size must include the NET_IP_ALIGN offset.

Thanks to Eric Dumazet for the initial patch highlighting the padding issues.
