tuntap: fix leaking reference count

Reference count leaking of both module and sock were found:

- When a detached file were closed, its sock refcnt from device were not
  released, solving this by add the sock_put().
- The module were hold or drop unconditionally in TUNSETPERSIST, which means we
  if we set the persist flag for N times, we need unset it for another N
  times. Solving this by only hold or drop an reference when there's a flag
  change and also drop the reference count when the persist device is deleted.
