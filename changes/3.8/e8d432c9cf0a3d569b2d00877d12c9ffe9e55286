ARM: kernel: add MIDR to per-CPU information data

The advent of big.LITTLE ARM platforms requires the kernel to be able
to identify the MIDRs of all online CPUs upon request. MIDRs are stashed
at boot time so that kernel subsystems can detect the MIDR of online CPUs
by simply retrieving per-CPU data updated by all booted CPUs.
