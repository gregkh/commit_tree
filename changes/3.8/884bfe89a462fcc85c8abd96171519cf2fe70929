ring-buffer: Add a 'dropped events' counter

The existing 'overrun' counter is incremented when the ring
buffer wraps around, with overflow on (the default). We wanted
a way to count requests lost from the buffer filling up with
overflow off, too. I decided to add a new counter instead
of retro-fitting the existing one because it seems like a
different statistic to count conceptually, and also because
of how the code was structured.
