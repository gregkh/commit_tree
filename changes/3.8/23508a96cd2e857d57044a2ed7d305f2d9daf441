dm: add WRITE SAME support

WRITE SAME bios have a payload that contain a single page.  When
cloning WRITE SAME bios DM has no need to modify the bi_io_vec
attributes (and doing so would be detrimental).  DM need only alter the
start and end of the WRITE SAME bio accordingly.

Rather than duplicate __clone_and_map_discard, factor out a common
function that is also used by __clone_and_map_write_same.
