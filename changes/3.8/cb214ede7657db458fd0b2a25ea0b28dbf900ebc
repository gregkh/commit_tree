x86/apic: Work around boot failure on HP ProLiant DL980 G7 Server systems

When a HP ProLiant DL980 G7 Server boots a regular kernel,
there will be intermittent lost interrupts which could
result in a hang or (in extreme cases) data loss.

The reason is that this system only supports x2apic physical
mode, while the kernel boots with a logical-cluster default
setting.

This bug can be worked around by specifying the "x2apic_phys" or
"nox2apic" boot option, but we want to handle this system
without requiring manual workarounds.

The BIOS sets ACPI_FADT_APIC_PHYSICAL in FADT table.
As all apicids are smaller than 255, BIOS need to pass the
control to the OS with xapic mode, according to x2apic-spec,
chapter 2.9.

Current code handle x2apic when BIOS pass with xapic mode
enabled:

When user specifies x2apic_phys, or FADT indicates PHYSICAL:

1. During madt oem check, apic driver is set with xapic logical
   or xapic phys driver at first.

2. enable_IR_x2apic() will enable x2apic_mode.

3. if user specifies x2apic_phys on the boot line, x2apic_phys_probe()
   will install the correct x2apic phys driver and use x2apic phys mode.
   Otherwise it will skip the driver will let x2apic_cluster_probe to
   take over to install x2apic cluster driver (wrong one) even though FADT
   indicates PHYSICAL, because x2apic_phys_probe does not check
   FADT PHYSICAL.

Add checking x2apic_fadt_phys in x2apic_phys_probe() to fix the
problem.
