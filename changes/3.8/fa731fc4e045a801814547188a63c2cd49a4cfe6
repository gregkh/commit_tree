GFS2: Fix truncation of journaled data files

This patch fixes an issue relating to not having enough revokes
available when truncating journaled data files. In order to ensure
that we do no run out, the truncation is broken into separate pieces
if it is large enough.

Tested using fsx on a journaled data file.
