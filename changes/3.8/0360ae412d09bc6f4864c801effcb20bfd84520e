netfilter: kill support for per-af queue backends

We used to have several queueing backends, but nowadays only
nfnetlink_queue remains.

In light of this there doesn't seem to be a good reason to
support per-af registering -- just hook up nfnetlink_queue on module
load and remove it on unload.

This means that the userspace BIND/UNBIND_PF commands are now obsolete;
the kernel will ignore them.
