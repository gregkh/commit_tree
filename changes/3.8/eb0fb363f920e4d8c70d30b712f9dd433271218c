tuntap: attach queue 0 before registering netdevice

We attach queue 0 after registering netdevice currently. This leads to call
netif_set_real_num_{tx|rx}_queues() after registering the netdevice. Since we
allow tun/tap has a maximum of 1024 queues, this may lead a huge number of
uevents to be injected to userspace since we create 2048 kobjects and then
remove 2046. Solve this problem by attaching queue 0 and set the real number of
queues before registering netdevice.
