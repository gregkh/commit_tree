ARM: perf: add guest vs host discrimination

Add minimal guest support to perf, so it can distinguish whether
the PMU interrupt was in the host or the guest, as well as collecting
some very basic information (guest PC, user vs kernel mode).

This is not feature complete though, as it doesn't support backtracing
in the guest.

Based on the x86 implementation, tested with KVM/ARM.
