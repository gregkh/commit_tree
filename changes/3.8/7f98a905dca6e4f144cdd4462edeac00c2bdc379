PM / devfreq: Add current freq callback in device profile

Devfreq returns governor predicted frequency as current frequency
via sysfs interface. But device may not support all frequencies
that governor predicts. So add a callback in device profile to get
current freq from driver. Also add a new sysfs node to expose
governor predicted next target frequency.
