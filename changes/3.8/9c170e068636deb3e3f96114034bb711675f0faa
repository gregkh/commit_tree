Revert "ath9k_hw: Update AR9003 high_power tx gain table"

This reverts commit f74b9d365ddd33a375802b064f96a5d0e99af7c0.

Turns out reverting commit a240dc7b3c7463bd60cf0a9b2a90f52f78aae0fd
"ath9k_hw: Updated AR9003 tx gain table for 5GHz" was not enough to
bring the tx power back to normal levels on devices like the
Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H, this one needs to be reverted as well.

This revert improves tx power by ~10 db on that device
