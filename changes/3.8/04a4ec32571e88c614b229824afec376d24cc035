cgroup_freezer: prepare freezer_change_state() for full hierarchy support

* Make freezer_change_state() take bool @freeze instead of enum
  freezer_state.

* Separate out freezer_apply_state() out of freezer_change_state().
  This makes freezer_change_state() a rather silly thin wrapper.  It
  will be filled with hierarchy handling later on.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior change.
