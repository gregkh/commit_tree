ext4: fix overhead calculations in ext4_stats, again

"overhead" was a write-only variable in this function after commit
952fc18e; we set it to 0 for minixdf, or to sbi->s_overhead if !minixdf,
but never read it again after that.

We need to use it, not sbi->s_overhead, when subtracting out overhead
for f_blocks, or we get the wrong answer for minixdf.
