xfs: move xfs_quiesce_attr() into xfs_super.c

Both callers of xfs_quiesce_attr() are in xfs_super.c, and there's
nothing really sync-specific about this functionality so it doesn't
really matter where it lives. Move it to benext to it's callers, so
all the remount/sync_fs code is in the one place.
