pinctrl: samsung: Distinguish between pin group and bank nodes

This patch modifies the loop iterating over all child nodes and parsing

checking for existence of samsung,pins property.

This is a prerequisite for further patches adding additional subnodes to
the pinctrl node, required for per bank GPIO and interrupt specifiers.
