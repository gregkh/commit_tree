br2684: allow assign only on a connected socket

The br2684 does not check if used vcc is in connected state,
causing potential Oops in pppoatm_send() when vcc->send() is called
on not fully connected socket.

Now br2684 can be assigned only on connected sockets; otherwise
-EINVAL error is returned.
