carl9170: fix spurious transmissions in sniffer mode

Several people have complained about an unusual
and undocumented feature of the AR9170 hardware:

In siffer mode, the hardware generates spurious
ACK frames for every received frame... even
broadcasts.

The reason for this malfunction is unknown:

But there's a workaround: Instead of the special
sniffer mode, the hardware will be put into
station mode and all rx filters are disabled.
