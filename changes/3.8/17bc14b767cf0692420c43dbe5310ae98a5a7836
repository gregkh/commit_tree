Revert "sched: Update_cfs_shares at period edge"

This reverts commit f269ae0469fc882332bdfb5db15d3c1315fe2a10.

It turns out it causes a very noticeable interactivity regression with
CONFIG_SCHED_AUTOGROUP (test-case: "make -j32" of the kernel in a
terminal window, while scrolling in a browser - the autogrouping means
that the two end up in separate cgroups, and the browser should be
smooth as silk despite the high load).

Says Paul Turner:
 "It seems that the update-throttling on the wake-side is reducing the
  interactive tasks' ability to preempt.  While I suspect the right
  longer term answer here is force these updates only in the
  cross-cgroup case; this is less trivial.  For this release I believe
  the right answer is either going to be a revert or restore the updates
  on the enqueue-side."
