md: close race between removing and adding a device.

When we remove a device from an md array, the final removal of
the "dev-XX" sys entry is run asynchronously.
If we then re-add that device immediately before the worker thread
gets to run, we can end up trying to add the "dev-XX" sysfs entry back
before it has been removed.

So in both places where we add a device, call
  flush_workqueue(md_misc_wq);
before taking the md lock (as holding the md lock can prevent removal
to complete).
