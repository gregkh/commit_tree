efi_pstore: Remove a logic erasing entries from a write callback to hold multiple logs

[Issue]

Currently, efi_pstore driver simply overwrites existing panic messages in NVRAM.
So, in the following scenario, we will lose 1st panic messages.

1. kernel panics.
2. efi_pstore is kicked and writes panic messages to NVRAM.
3. system reboots.
4. kernel panics again before a user checks the 1st panic messages in NVRAM.

[Solution]

A reasonable solution to fix the issue is just holding multiple logs without erasing
existing entries.
This patch removes a logic erasing existing entries in a write callback
because the logic is not needed in the write callback to support holding multiple logs.
