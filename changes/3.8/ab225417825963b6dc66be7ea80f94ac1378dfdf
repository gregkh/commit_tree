NFS: Don't silently fail setattr() requests on mountpoints

Ensure that any setattr and getattr requests for junctions and/or
mountpoints are sent to the server. Ever since commit
0ec26fd0698 (vfs: automount should ignore LOOKUP_FOLLOW), we have
silently dropped any setattr requests to a server-side mountpoint.
For referrals, we have silently dropped both getattr and setattr
requests.

This patch restores the original behaviour for setattr on mountpoints,
and tries to do the same for referrals, provided that we have a
filehandle...
