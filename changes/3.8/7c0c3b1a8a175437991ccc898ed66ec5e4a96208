tuntap: forbid calling TUNSETIFF when detached

Michael points out that even after Stefan's fix the TUNSETIFF is still allowed
to create a new tap device. This because we only check tfile->tun but the
tfile->detached were introduced. Fix this by failing early in tun_set_iff() if
the file is detached. After this fix, there's no need to do the check again in
tun_set_iff(), so this patch removes it.
