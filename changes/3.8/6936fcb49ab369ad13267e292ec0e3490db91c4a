drbd: Move the CREATE_BARRIER flag from connection to device

That is necessary since the whole transfer log is per connection(tconn)
and not per device(mdev).

This bug caused list corruption on the worker list. When a barrier is queued
for sending in the context of one device, another device did not see the
CREATE_BARRIER bit, and queued the same object again -> list corruption.
