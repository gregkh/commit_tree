staging: et131x: Fix i386 build warnings from use of dma_addr_t

dma_addr_t can be of size 64 or 32bits, depending on the architecture.

This fixes these build warnings for ARCH=i386, and also tested on x86_64:

drivers/staging/et131x/et131x.c: In function ‘et131x_rx_dma_memory_alloc’:
drivers/staging/et131x/et131x.c:2356:11: warning: passing argument 2 of ‘et131x_align_allocated_memory’ from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
