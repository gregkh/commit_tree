mm: adjust address_space_operations.migratepage() return code

Memory fragmentation introduced by ballooning might reduce significantly
the number of 2MB contiguous memory blocks that can be used within a
guest, thus imposing performance penalties associated with the reduced
number of transparent huge pages that could be used by the guest workload.

This patch-set follows the main idea discussed at 2012 LSFMMS session:
"Ballooning for transparent huge pages" -- http://lwn.net/Articles/490114/
to introduce the required changes to the virtio_balloon driver, as well as
the changes to the core compaction & migration bits, in order to make
those subsystems aware of ballooned pages and allow memory balloon pages
become movable within a guest, thus avoiding the aforementioned
fragmentation issue

Following are numbers that prove this patch benefits on allowing
compaction to be more effective at memory ballooned guests.

Results for STRESS-HIGHALLOC benchmark, from Mel Gorman's mmtests suite,
running on a 4gB RAM KVM guest which was ballooning 512mB RAM in 64mB
chunks, at every minute (inflating/deflating), while test was running:

This patch:

Introduce MIGRATEPAGE_SUCCESS as the default return code for
address_space_operations.migratepage() method and documents the expected
return code for the same method in failure cases.
