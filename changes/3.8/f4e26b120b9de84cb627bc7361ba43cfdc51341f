sched: Introduce temporary FAIR_GROUP_SCHED dependency for load-tracking

While per-entity load-tracking is generally useful, beyond computing shares
distribution, e.g. runnable based load-balance (in progress), governors,
power-management, etc.

These facilities are not yet consumers of this data.  This may be trivially
reverted when the information is required; but avoid paying the overhead for
calculations we will not use until then.
