efi_pstore: Check remaining space with QueryVariableInfo() before writing data

[Issue]

As discussed in a thread below, Running out of space in EFI isn't a well-tested scenario.
And we wouldn't expect all firmware to handle it gracefully.

On the other hand, current efi_pstore doesn't check a remaining space of storage at writing time.
Therefore, efi_pstore may not work if it tries to write a large amount of data.

[Patch Description]

To avoid handling the situation above, this patch checks if there is a space enough to log with
QueryVariableInfo() before writing data.
