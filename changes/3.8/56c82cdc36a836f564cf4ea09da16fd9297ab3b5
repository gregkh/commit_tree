musb: tusb6010: use io{read,write}*_rep accessors

The {read,write}s{b,w,l} operations are not defined by all architectures
and are being removed from the asm-generic/io.h interface.

This patch replaces the usage of these string functions in the tusb6010
accessors with io{read,write}{8,16,32}_rep calls instead.
