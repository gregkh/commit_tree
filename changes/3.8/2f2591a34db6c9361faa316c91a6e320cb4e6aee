cifs: don't compare uniqueids in cifs_prime_dcache unless server inode numbers are in use

Oliver reported that commit cd60042c caused his cifs mounts to
continually thrash through new inodes on readdir. His servers are not
sending inode numbers (or he's not using them), and the new test in
that function doesn't account for that sort of setup correctly.

If we're not using server inode numbers, then assume that the inode
attached to the dentry hasn't changed. Go ahead and update the
attributes in place, but keep the same inode number.
