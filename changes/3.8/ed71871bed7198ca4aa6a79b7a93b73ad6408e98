tty/8250_early: Turn serial_in/serial_out into weak symbols.

Allows overriding default methods serial_in/serial_out.

In such platform specific replacement it is possible to use
other regshift, biased register offset, any other manipulation
that is not covered with common default methods.

Overriding default methods may be useful for platforms which got
serial peripheral with registers represented in big endian.
In this situation and assuming that 32 bit operations / alignment
is required then it may be useful to swab words before/after
accessing the serial registers.
