mtd: nand: add NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO to autodetect bus width

The driver call nand_scan_ident in 8 bit mode, then
readid or onfi detection are done (and detect bus width).
The driver should update its bus width before calling nand_scan_tail.

This work because readid and onfi are read work 8 byte mode.

Note that nand_scan_ident send command (NAND_CMD_RESET, NAND_CMD_READID, NAND_CMD_PARAM), address and read data
The ONFI specificication is not very clear for x16 device if high byte of address should be driven to 0,
but according to [1] it should be ok to not drive it during autodetection.

3.3.2. Target Initialization

[...]
The Read ID and Read Parameter Page commands only use the lower 8-bits of the data bus.
The host shall not issue commands that use a word data width on x16 devices until the host
determines the device supports a 16-bit data bus width in the parameter page.
