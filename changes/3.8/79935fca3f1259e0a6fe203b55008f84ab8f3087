drm/i915: don't intel_crt_init if DDI A has 4 lanes

DDI A and E have 4 lanes to share, so if DDI A is using 4 lanes,
there's nothing left for DDI E, which means there's no CRT port on the
machine.

The bit we're checking here is programmed at system boot and it cannot
be changed afterwards, so we cannot change the amount of lanes
reserved for each DDI port.
