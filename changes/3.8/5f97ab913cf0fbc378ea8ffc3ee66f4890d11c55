drm/nouveau: add lockdep annotations

1) Lockdep thinks all nouveau subdevs belong to the same class and can be
locked in arbitrary order, which is not true (at least in general case).
Tell it to distinguish subdevs by (o)class type.
2) DRM client can be locked under user client lock - tell lockdep to put
DRM client lock in a separate class.
