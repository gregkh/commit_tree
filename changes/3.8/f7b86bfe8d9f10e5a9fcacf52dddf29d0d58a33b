sockopt: Make SO_BINDTODEVICE readable

The SO_BINDTODEVICE option is the only SOL_SOCKET one that can be set, but
cannot be get via sockopt API. The only way we can find the device id a
socket is bound to is via sock-diag interface. But the diag works only on
hashed sockets, while the opt in question can be set for yet unhashed one.

That said, in order to know what device a socket is bound to (we do want
to know this in checkpoint-restore project) I propose to make this option
getsockopt-able and report the respective device index.

Another solution to the problem might be to teach the sock-diag reporting
info on unhashed sockets. Should I go this way instead?
