PCI: Add PLX PCI 9050 workaround for some Meilhaus DAQ cards

The Meilhaus ME-2000i and ME-2600i data acquisition cards supported by
the Comedi "me_daq" driver use the PLX PCI 9050 PCI Target bridge chip
affected by the bug that prevents the chip's local configuration
registers being read from BAR0 or BAR1 base addresses that are an odd
multiple of 128 bytes.  Use the PLX PCI 9050 quirk handler for these
devices to re-allocate affected regions to a 256-byte boundary.
