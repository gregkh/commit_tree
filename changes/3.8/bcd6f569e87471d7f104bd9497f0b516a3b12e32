clk: Common clocks implementation for Versatile Express

This patch adds a DT and non-DT based implementation of
the common clock infrastructure for Versatile Express
platform. It registers (statically or using DT) all
required fixed clocks, initialises motherboard's SP810
cell (that provides clocks for SP804 timers) and
explicitly registers VE "osc" driver, to make the
clock generators available early.
