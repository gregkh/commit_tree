xen: privcmd: support autotranslated physmap guests.

PVH and ARM only support the batch interface. To map a foreign page to
a process, the PFN must be allocated and the autotranslated path uses
ballooning for that purpose.

The returned PFN is then mapped to the foreign page.
xen_unmap_domain_mfn_range() is introduced to unmap these pages via the
privcmd close call.
