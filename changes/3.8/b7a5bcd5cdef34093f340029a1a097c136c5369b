clk/ux500: explicitly include register header

The ux500 clock driver file named u8500_clk.c does not compile
if it loose implicit dependencies to <mach/db8500-regs.h>
(I have no clue what files will include this) which manifests
itself as I'm experimenting with SPARSE_IRQ so make the
dependency explicit.
