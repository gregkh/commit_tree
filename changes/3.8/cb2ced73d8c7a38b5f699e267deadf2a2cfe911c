Btrfs: in scrub repair code, optimize the reading of mirrors

In case that disk blocks need to be repaired (rewritten), the
current code at first (for simplicity reasons) reads all alternate
mirrors in the first step, afterwards selects the best one in a
second step. This is now changed to read one alternate mirror
after the other and to leave the loop early when a perfect mirror
is found.
