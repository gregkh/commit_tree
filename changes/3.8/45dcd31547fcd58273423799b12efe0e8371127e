Cleanup of invalid ACPI name handling and repair

 Implemented a change/cleanup for the handling of invalid ACPI names.
 Names are now validated and repaired only when
 1) entering a new name into the namespace and
 2) disassembling a named AML opcode. A warning is only displayed in
    debug mode or when the interpreter is in "strict" mode, since some
    working machines do in fact contain invalid ACPI names.
