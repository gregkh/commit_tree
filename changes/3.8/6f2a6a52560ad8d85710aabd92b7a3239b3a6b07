mtd: nand: gpmi: reset BCH earlier, too, to avoid NAND startup problems

It could happen (1 out of 100 times) that NAND did not start up
correctly after warm rebooting, so the kernel could not find the UBI or
DMA timed out due to a stalled BCH. When resetting BCH together with
GPMI, the issue could not be observed anymore (after 10000+ reboots). We
probably need the consistent state already before sending any command to
NAND, even when no ECC is needed. I chose to keep the extra reset for
BCH when changing the flash layout to be on the safe side.
