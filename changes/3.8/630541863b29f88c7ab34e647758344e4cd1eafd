ttm: don't destroy old mm_node on memcpy failure

When we are using memcpy to move objects around, and we fail to memcpy
due to lack of memory to populate or failure to finish the copy, we don't
want to destroy the mm_node that has been copied into old_copy.

While working on a new kms driver that uses memcpy, if I overallocated bo's
up to the memory limits, and eviction failed, then machine would oops soon
after due to having an active bo with an already freed drm_mm embedded in it,
freeing it a second time didn't end well.
