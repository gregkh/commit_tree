mm,numa: fix update_mmu_cache_pmd call

This build error is currently hidden by the fact that the x86
implementation of 'update_mmu_cache_pmd()' is a macro that doesn't use
its last argument, but commit b32967ff101a ("mm: numa: Add THP migration
for the NUMA working set scanning fault case") introduced a call with
the wrong third argument.

In the akpm tree, it causes this build error:

  mm/migrate.c: In function 'migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page_put':
  mm/migrate.c:1666:2: error: incompatible type for argument 3 of 'update_mmu_cache_pmd'
  arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable.h:792:20: note: expected 'struct pmd_t *' but argument is of type 'pmd_t'

Fix it.
