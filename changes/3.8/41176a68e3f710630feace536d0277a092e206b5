xfs: create function to scan and clear EOFBLOCKS inodes

xfs_inodes_free_eofblocks() implements scanning functionality for
EOFBLOCKS inodes. It uses the AG iterator to walk the tagged inodes
and free post-EOF blocks via the xfs_inode_free_eofblocks() execute
function. The scan can be invoked in best-effort mode or wait
(force) mode.

A best-effort scan (default) handles all inodes that do not have a
dirty cache and we successfully acquire the io lock via trylock. In
wait mode, we continue to cycle through an AG until all inodes are
handled.
