ext4: warn when discard request fails other than EOPNOTSUPP

We should warn user then the discard request fails. However we need to
exclude -EOPNOTSUPP case since parts of the device might not support it
while other parts can. So print the kernel warning when the error !=
-EOPNOTSUPP is returned from ext4_issue_discard().

We should also handle error cases in batched discard, again excluding
EOPNOTSUPP.
