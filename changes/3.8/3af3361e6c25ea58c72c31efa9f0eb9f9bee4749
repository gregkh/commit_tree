ixgbe: fix default setting of TXDCTL.WTHRESH

The q_vector->itr check in ixgbe_configure_tx_ring() was done prior to it
being set, which resulted in TXDCTL.WTHRESH always being set to 1 on driver
load, while consequent resets would set it to 8.

This patch moves the setting of q_vector->itr in ixgbe_alloc_q_vector() to
make sure that TXDCTL.WTHRESH is set to 8 by default.
