  A NACK is probably the right thing. I was mostly converting a few
  other drivers which used some simple, common patterns to use my new
  common code, but this driver was missing it altogether. It looks like
  there may be bigger issues, though, as you point out.

  As noted earlier, I don't have much interest in this driver. I agree
  that there are some other issues with the driver; I think it leaks
  memory if it is ever allowed to unload, for one. Feel free to submit
  an alternative patch to prevent this driver from being built as a
  module.
