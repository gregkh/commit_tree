[media] V4L: Add driver for S3C24XX/S3C64XX SoC series camera interface

This patch adds V4L2 driver for Samsung S3C24XX/S3C64XX SoC series
camera interface. The driver exposes a subdev device node for CAMIF
pixel resolution and crop control and two video capture nodes - for
the "codec" and "preview" data paths. It has been tested on Mini2440
(s3c2440) and Mini6410 (s3c6410) board with gstreamer and mplayer.
