xfs: verify btree blocks as they are read from disk

Add an btree block verify callback function and pass it into the
buffer read functions. Because each different btree block type
requires different verification, add a function to the ops structure
that is called from the generic code.

Also, propagate the verification callback functions through the
readahead functions, and into the external bmap and bulkstat inode
readahead code that uses the generic btree buffer read functions.
