i2c: omap: cleanup the sysc write

Currently after the reset the sysc is written with hardcoded values.
The patch reads the sysc register and writes back the same value
after reset.

- Some unnecessary rev checks can be optimised.
- Also due to whatever reason the hwmod flags are changed
we will not reset the values.
- In some of the cases the minor values of the 2430 register
is different(0x37) in that case the autoidle setting may be missed.
