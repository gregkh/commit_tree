ALSA: hda - Add workaround for conflicting IEC958 controls

When both an SPDIF and an HDMI device are created on the same card
instance, multiple IEC958 controls are created with indices=0, 1, ...
But the alsa-lib configuration can't know which index corresponds
actually to which PCM device, and both the SPDIF and the HDMI
configurations point to the first IEC958 control wrongly.

This patch introduces a (hackish and ugly) workaround: the IEC958
controls for the SPDIF device are re-labeled with device=1 when HDMI
coexists.  The device=1 corresponds to the actual PCM device for
SPDIF, so it's anyway a better representation.  In future, HDMI
controls should be moved with the corresponding PCM device number,
too.
