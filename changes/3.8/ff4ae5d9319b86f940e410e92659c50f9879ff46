ARM: OMAP2+: CM/hwmod: split CM functions into OMAP2, OMAP3-specific files

Move OMAP3xxx-specific CM functions & macros into cm3xxx.[ch] and
OMAP2xxx-specific macros into cm2xxx.[ch].  Move basic CM register
access functions into static inline functions in cm2xxx_3xxx.h,
leaving only OMAP2/3 hardreset functions in cm2xxx_3xxx.c.

As part of this, split the CM and hwmod code that waits for devices to
become ready into SoC-specific functions.

This is in preparation for the upcoming move of this code to drivers/.
