drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c: fetch dmi version from SMBIOS if it exists

The right dmi version is in SMBIOS if it's zero in DMI region

This issue was originally found from an oracle bug.
One customer noticed system UUID doesn't match between dmidecode & uek2.

 - HP ProLiant BL460c G6 :
   # cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid
   00000000-0000-4C48-3031-4D5030333531
   # dmidecode | grep -i uuid
   UUID: 00000000-0000-484C-3031-4D5030333531

From SMBIOS 2.6 on, spec use little-endian encoding for UUID other than
network byte order.

So we need to get dmi version to distinguish.  If version is 0.0, the
real version is taken from the SMBIOS version.  This is part of original
kernel comment in code.
