pppoatm: fix missing wakeup in pppoatm_send()

Now that we can return zero from pppoatm_send() for reasons *other* than
the queue being full, that means we can't depend on a subsequent call to
pppoatm_pop() waking the queue, and we might leave it stalled
indefinitely.

Use the ->release_cb() callback to wake the queue after the sock is
unlocked.
