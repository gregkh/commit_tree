ASoC: wm0010: Add checking for .dfw info record version.

The info record at the start of the dsp firmware file has been
expanded to incorporate additional version information. We need
to check the version to make sure we understand the layout of
the information in the record. The srec2image tool is currently
used to create this record during creation of the .dfw file.
