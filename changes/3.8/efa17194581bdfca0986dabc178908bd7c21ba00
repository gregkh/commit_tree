cpufreq: Add module aliases for acpi-cpufreq

The acpi core will call request_module("acpi-cpufreq") on subsystem init,
but this will fail if the module isn't available at that stage of boot.
Add some module aliases to ensure that udev can load the module on Intel
and AMD systems with the appropriate feature bits - I /think/ that this
will also work on VIA systems, but haven't verified that.
