vxlan: Add capability of Rx checksum offload for inner packet

This patch adds capability in vxlan to identify received
checksummed inner packets and signal them to the upper layers of
the stack. The driver needs to set the skb->encapsulation bit
and also set the skb->ip_summed to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.
