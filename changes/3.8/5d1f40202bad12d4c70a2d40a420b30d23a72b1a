Btrfs: fix missing i_size update

If we have an ordered extent before the ordered extent we are currently
completing that is after the current disk_i_size we will put our i_size
update into that ordered extent so that we do not expose stale data.  The
problem is that if our disk i_size is updated past the previous ordered
extent we won't update the i_size with the pending i_size update.  So check
the pending i_size update and if its above the current disk i_size we need
to go ahead and try to update.  Thanks,
