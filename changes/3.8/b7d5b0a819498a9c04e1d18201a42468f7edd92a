Btrfs: fix joining the same transaction handler more than 2 times

If we flush inodes with pending delalloc in a transaction, we may join
the same transaction handler more than 2 times.

The reason is:
  Task						use_count of trans handle
  commit_transaction				1
    |-> btrfs_start_delalloc_inodes		1
	  |-> run_delalloc_nocow		1
		|-> join_transaction		2
		|-> cow_file_range		2
			|-> join_transaction	3

In fact, cow_file_range needn't join the transaction again because the caller
have joined the transaction, so we fix this problem by this way.
