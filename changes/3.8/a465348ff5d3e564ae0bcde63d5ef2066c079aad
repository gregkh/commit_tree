crypto: s5p-sss - Fix compilation error

struct s3c2410_dma_client gets defined multiple times as it is defined
in more than one header file. Changing it at the header file level causes
many more build breakages as they are interdependent in a complex way.
Hence fixing this problem by using the mach version of the header file.

Without this patch, following build error is observed:
arch/arm/plat-samsung/include/plat/dma-pl330.h:106:27: error:
redefinition of struct s3c2410_dma_client
