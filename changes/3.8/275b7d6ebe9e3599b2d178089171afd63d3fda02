hwmon: (w83627hf) Add support for suspend

On suspend some register values are lost, most notably the Value RAM
areas but also other limits. Restore them on resume. On top of that,
some fixups are needed to work around BIOS bugs, in particular when
the BIOS omits running the same initialization sequence on resume
that it does after boot. In that case we have to carry initialization
over suspend.
