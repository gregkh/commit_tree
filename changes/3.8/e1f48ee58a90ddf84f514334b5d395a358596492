drm/exynos: call drm_vblank_put for each queued flip event

It's guaranteed that for each event on pageflip_event_list we have
called drm_vblank_get() - see exynos_drm_crtc_page_flip() - so checking
for this is redundant.

Also we need to call drm_vblank_put() for each event on the list, not
only once, otherwise we'd leak vblank references if there are multiple
events on the list.
