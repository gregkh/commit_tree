checkpatch: find hex constants as a single IDENT

Hexadecimal values are current found in 2 parts.  A hex constant like
0x123456abcdef is found as 0 and then x123456abcdef and later coalesced.

Instead, reverse the order of the 2 searches in $Constant to find 0x
first, then 0 so that the entire hex constant is found all at once.
