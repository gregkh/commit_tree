ARM: 7607/1: realview: fix private peripheral memory base for EB rev. B boards

Commit 34ae6c96a6a7 ("ARM: 7298/1: realview: fix mapping of MPCore
private memory region") accidentally broke the definition for the base
address of the private peripheral region on revision B Realview-EB
boards.

This patch uses the correct address for REALVIEW_EB11MP_PRIV_MEM_BASE.
