drivers/net: fix up function prototypes after __dev* removals

The __dev* removal patches for the network drivers ended up messing up
the function prototypes for a bunch of drivers.  This patch fixes all of
them back up to be properly aligned.

Bonus is that this almost removes 100 lines of code, always a nice
surprise.
