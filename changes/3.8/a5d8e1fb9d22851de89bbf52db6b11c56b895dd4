drbd: Convert boolean flags on netlink from NLA_FLAG to NLA_U8

Flags of type NLA_FLAG are either present or absent, but do not have a
value by themselves.  Use type NLA_U8 for our boolean flags instead, and
use the value to determine if the flag should be on or off.

On the drbdsetup command line, all those flags have an optional yes/no
argument which defaults to yes.
