brcmfmac: restructure handling of IF event

The IF event need special care. It can be either an ADD, DEL, or
CHANGE. For an ADD we need to call brcmf_add_if() before the
event handler call. Upon a DEL we need to call brcmf_del_if()
after the event handler call. CHANGE does not require special
attention.
