x86, topology: Don't offline CPU0 if any PIC irq can not be migrated out of it

If CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU is turned on, CPU0 hotplug feature is enabled
by default.

If CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU is not turned on, CPU0 hotplug feature is not
enabled by default. The kernel parameter cpu0_hotplug can enable CPU0 hotplug
feature at boot.

Currently the feature is supported on Intel platforms only.
