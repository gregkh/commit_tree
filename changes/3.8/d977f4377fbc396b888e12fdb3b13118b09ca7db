target: simplify reservations code

We do not support host-level reservations for the pscsi backend, and all
virtual backends are newere than SCSI-2, so just make the combined
SPC-3 + SCSI-2 support the only supported variant and kill the switches
for the different implementations, given that this code handles the no-op
version just fine.
