tracing: Kill unused and puzzled sample code in ftrace.h

When doing per-cpu helper optimizing work, find that this code is so puzzled.
1. It's mark as comment text, maybe a sample function for guidelines
   or a todo work.
2. But, this sample code is odd where struct perf_trace_buf is nonexistent.
   commit ce71b9 delete struct perf_trace_buf definition.

   tracing: Use the perf recursion protection from trace event

Is it necessary to keep there?
just compile test.
