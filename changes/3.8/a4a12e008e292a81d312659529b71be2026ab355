ARM: virt: Avoid bx instruction for compatibility with <=ARMv4

Non-T variants of ARMv4 do not support the bx instruction.

However, __hyp_stub_install is always called from the same
instruction set used to build the bulk of the kernel, so bx should
not be necessary.

This patch uses the traditional "mov pc" instead of bx.
