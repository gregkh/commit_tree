ACPI, APEI, EINJ: Add missed ACPI5 support for error trigger table

To handle error trigger table correctly, memory region must be
removed from request region. We had a series of patches to do this
culminating in:
	commit b4e008dc5
	ACPI, APEI, EINJ, Refine the fix of resource conflict

but when ACPI5 support was added, we missed updating this area. So
when using EINJ table on an ACPI5 enabled machine, we get following error:

APEI: Can not request [mem 0x526b80000-0x526b80007] for APEI EINJ
Trigger registers

Fix this by checking for the acpi5 case and using the same code
that was added earlier.
