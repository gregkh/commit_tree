staging: comedi: me_daq: all boards have the same analog input specs

All the boards supported by this driver have the same analog input
specifications. Remove the unnecessary boardinfo and just open-code
the values in the subdevice initialization.

The boards also share the same analog input range capabilities. Remove
one of the duplicate tables and rename the other to make it common for
all board types.
