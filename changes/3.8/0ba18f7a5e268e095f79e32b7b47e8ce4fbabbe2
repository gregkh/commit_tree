netcls_cgroup: move config inheritance to ->css_online() and remove .broken_hierarchy marking

It turns out that we'll have to live with attributes which are
inherited at cgroup creation time but not affected by further updates
to the parent afterwards - such attributes are already in wide use
e.g. for cpuset.

So, there's nothing to do for netcls_cgroup for hierarchy support.
Its current behavior - inherit only during creation - is good enough.

Move config inheriting from ->css_alloc() to ->css_online() for
consistency, which doesn't change behavior at all, and remove
.broken_hierarchy marking.
