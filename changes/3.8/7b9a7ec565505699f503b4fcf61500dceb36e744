proc: don't show nonexistent capabilities

Without this patch it is really hard to interpret a bounding set, if
CAP_LAST_CAP is unknown for a current kernel.

Non-existant capabilities can not be deleted from a bounding set with help
of prctl.

E.g.: Here are two examples without/with this patch.

  CapBnd:	ffffffe0fdecffff
  CapBnd:	00000000fdecffff

I suggest to hide non-existent capabilities. Here is two reasons.
* It's logically and easier for using.
* It helps to checkpoint-restore capabilities of tasks, because tasks
can be restored on another kernel, where CAP_LAST_CAP is bigger.
