usb: musb: Perform only write access on MUSB_INTRTXE

This is part of the workaround for AM35x advisory Advisory 1.1.20.
The advisory says that the IPSS bridge can't handle 8 & 16 bit read
access. An 16bit read access to MUSB_INTRTXE results in an 32bit read
access which also reads INTRRX and therefore may lose interrupts.
This patch uses a shadow register of MUSB_INTRTXE so we only perform
write access to it.
