powerpc: Add relocation on exception vector handlers

POWER8/v2.07 allows exceptions to be taken with the MMU still on.

A new set of exception vectors is added at 0xc000_0000_0000_4xxx.  When the HW
takes us here, MSR IR/DR will be set already and we no longer need a costly
RFID to turn the MMU back on again.

The original 0x0 based exception vectors remain for when the HW can't leave the
MMU on.  Examples of this are when we can't trust the current MMU mappings,
like when we are changing from guest to hypervisor (HV 0 -> 1) or when the MMU
was off already.  In these cases the HW will take us to the original 0x0 based
exception vectors with the MMU off as before.

This uses the new macros added previously too implement these new execption
vectors at 0xc000_0000_0000_4xxx.  We exit these exception vectors using
mflr/blr (rather than mtspr SSR0/RFID), since we don't need the costly MMU
switch anymore.

This moves the __end_interrupts marker down past these new 0x4000 vectors since
they will need to be copied down to 0x0 when the kernel is not at 0x0.
