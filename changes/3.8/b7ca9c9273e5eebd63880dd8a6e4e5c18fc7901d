dm thin: replace dm_cell_release_singleton with cell_defer_except

Change existing users of the function dm_cell_release_singleton to share
cell_defer_except instead, and then remove the now-unused function.

Everywhere that calls dm_cell_release_singleton, the bio in question
is the holder of the cell.

If there are no non-holder entries in the cell then cell_defer_except
behaves exactly like dm_cell_release_singleton.  Conversely, if there
*are* non-holder entries then dm_cell_release_singleton must not be used
because those entries would need to be deferred.

Consequently, it is safe to replace use of dm_cell_release_singleton
with cell_defer_except.

This patch is a pre-requisite for "dm thin: fix race between
simultaneous io and discards to same block".
