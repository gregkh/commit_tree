cgroup_freezer: make freezer->state mask of flags

freezer->state was an enum value - one of THAWED, FREEZING and FROZEN.
As the scheduled full hierarchy support requires more than one
freezing condition, switch it to mask of flags.  If FREEZING is not
set, it's thawed.  FREEZING is set if freezing or frozen.  If frozen,
both FREEZING and FROZEN are set.  Now that tasks can be attached to
an already frozen cgroup, this also makes freezing condition checks
more natural.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior change.
