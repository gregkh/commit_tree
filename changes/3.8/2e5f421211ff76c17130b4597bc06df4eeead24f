tcp: frto should not set snd_cwnd to 0

Commit 9dc274151a548 (tcp: fix ABC in tcp_slow_start())
uncovered a bug in FRTO code :
tcp_process_frto() is setting snd_cwnd to 0 if the number
of in flight packets is 0.

As Neal pointed out, if no packet is in flight we lost our
chance to disambiguate whether a loss timeout was spurious.

We should assume it was a proper loss.
