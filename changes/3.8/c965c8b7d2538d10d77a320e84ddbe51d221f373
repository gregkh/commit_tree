staging: comedi: addi_common.c: fix the test for the PCI bars

staging: comedi: addi-data: cleanup reading of the PCI bars

Changed this test before reading the PCI bars:

	if ((this_board->pc_EepromChip == NULL)
		|| (strcmp(this_board->pc_EepromChip, ADDIDATA_9054) != 0)) {

to this:

	if (!this_board->pc_EepromChip ||
	    !strcmp(this_board->pc_EepromChip, ADDIDATA_9054)) {

I just noticed that the strcmp test is wrong.

This fixes the test and adds a comment for it.

This error "broke" the addi-data drivers but they are broken anyway
since they don't follow the comedi core API.

The addi_apci_1032 driver has been converted to follow the comedi core
API. This error effects that driver since the iobase for it should be
found in PCI bar 1 not 2. This fixes that also.
