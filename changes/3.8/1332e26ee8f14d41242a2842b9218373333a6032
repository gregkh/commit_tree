brcmfmac: change parameter of brcmf_set_management_ie()

The function brcmf_set_management_ie() operates on virtual
interface data and brcmf_cfg80211_vif structure provides
all information needed for interfacing with firmware. As
this function will also be needed for interface without
an associated net device it makes sense to provide the vif
instead of deriving it from the net device.
