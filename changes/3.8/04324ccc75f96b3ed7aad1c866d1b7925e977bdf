ALSA: usb-audio: add channel map support

Add the support for channel maps of the PCM streams on USB audio
devices.  The channel map information is already found in
ChannelConfig descriptor entries, which haven't been referred until
now.

Each chmap entry is added to audioformat list entry and copied to TLV
dynamically instead of creating a whole chmap array.
