phy/marvell: remove fiber/copper autoselect on 88e1111

Remove the code that always enables copper/fiber autoselect,
ignoring the DIS_FC strapping pin. The default value for this
register is autoselect on anyway, and if you explicitly disable
autoselect via strapping you probably really don't want
autoselect.
