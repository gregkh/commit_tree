net: sctp: sctp_v6_get_dst: fix boolean test in dst cache

We walk through the bind address list and try to get the best source
address for a given destination. However, currently, we take the
'continue' path of the loop when an entry is invalid (!laddr->valid)
*and* the entry state does not equal SCTP_ADDR_SRC (laddr->state !=
SCTP_ADDR_SRC).

Thus, still, invalid entries with SCTP_ADDR_SRC might not 'continue'
as well as valid entries with SCTP_ADDR_{NEW, SRC, DEL}, with a possible
false baddr and matchlen as a result, causing in worst case dst route
to be false or possibly NULL.

This test should actually be a '||' instead of '&&'. But lets fix it
and make this a bit easier to read by having the condition the same way
as similarly done in sctp_v4_get_dst.
