net: splice: avoid high order page splitting

splice() can handle pages of any order, but network code tries hard to
split them in PAGE_SIZE units. Not quite successfully anyway, as
__splice_segment() assumed poff < PAGE_SIZE. This is true for
the skb->data part, not necessarily for the fragments.

This patch removes this logic to give the pages as they are in the skb.
