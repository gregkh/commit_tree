xfs: verify AGFL blocks as they are read from disk

Add an AGFL block verify callback function and pass it into the
buffer read functions.

While this commit adds verification code to the AGFL, it cannot be
used reliably until the CRC format change comes along as mkfs does
not initialise the full AGFL. Hence it can be full of garbage at the
first mount and will fail verification right now. CRC enabled
filesystems won't have this problem, so leave the code that has
already been written ifdef'd out until the proper time.
