led: Add dependency on CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGERS to led_trigger_rename_static()

This patch fixes build warnings when CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGERS is
disabled as below:
include/linux/leds.h:158:18: warning: 'struct led_trigger' declared inside parameter list [enabled by default]
include/linux/leds.h:158:18: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want [enabled
by default]
