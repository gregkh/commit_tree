drbd: Consider the disk-timeout also for meta-data IO operations

If the backing device is already frozen during attach, we failed
to recognize that. The current disk-timeout code works on top
of the drbd_request objects. During attach we do not allow IO
and therefore never generate a drbd_request object but block
before that in drbd_make_request().

This patch adds the timeout to all drbd_md_sync_page_io().

Before this patch we used to go from D_ATTACHING directly
to D_DISKLESS if IO failed during attach. We can no longer
do this since we have to stay in D_FAILED until all IO
ops issued to the backing device returned.
