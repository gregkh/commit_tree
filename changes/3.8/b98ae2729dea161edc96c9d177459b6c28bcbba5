ALSA: usb - fix race in creation of M-Audio Fast track pro driver

A patch in the 3.2 kernel caused regression with hotplugging the
M-Audio Fast track pro, or sound after suspend. I don't have the
device so I haven't done a full analysis, but it seems userspace
(both udev and pulseaudio) got confused when a card was created,
immediately destroyed, and then created again.

However, at least one person in the bug report (martin djfun)
reports that this patch resolves the issue for him. It also leaves
a message in the log:
"snd-usb-audio: probe of 1-1.1:1.1 failed with error -5" which is
a bit misleading. It is better than non-working audio, but maybe
there's a more elegant solution?
