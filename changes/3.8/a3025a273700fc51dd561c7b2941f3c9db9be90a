drbd: Fix comparison of is_valid_transition()'s return code

is_valid_transition() might return SS_NOTHING_TO_DO.

The condition function _req_st_cond() returned SS_NOTHING_TO_DO, which
caused the wait_event to abort too early. Therefore drbd_req_state()
did not consume the next CL_ST_CHG_SUCCESS or SS_CW_FAILED_BY_PEER
causing serve disruption of the state machine logic...

Detaching from a single volue was one way to trigger this bug.
