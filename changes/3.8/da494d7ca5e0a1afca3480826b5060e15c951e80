drm/i915: disable shrinker lock stealing for create_mmap_offset

The mmap offset structure is not part of the drm/i915 code, but
provided by gem helpers. To avoid leaky abstractions (by either
depending upon implementation details of said helper wrt to
preallocations, or reimplementing it in our code and so fuzzing
around in internal details of that helpr) simply disable
the shrinker lock stealing accross calls into the helper functions.

This should fix igt/gem_tiled_swapping.

v2: Fix cleanup path confusion bemoaned by Chris Wilson.
