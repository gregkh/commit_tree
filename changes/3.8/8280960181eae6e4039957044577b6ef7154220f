ARM: OMAP: Remove cpu_is_omap usage from plat-omap/dma.c

This code will be eventually in drivers, and for the
code in the drivers we don't want to have any cpu_is_omap
usage. Those macros should be private to arch/arm/mach-omap1
and arch/arm/mach-omap2.

To fix this, let's move the define for dma_omap2plus()
to dma-omap.h, and use the existing dma_attr passed in
the platform_data as the revision registers are what they
are.

Note that we can now also remove the relative includes
introduced by the recent clean-up patches.
