clk: Don't return negative numbers for unsigned values with !clk

Some of the helper functions return negative error codes if
passed a NULL clock. This can lead to confusing behavior when the
expected return value is unsigned. Fix up these accessors so that
they return unsigned values (or bool in the case of is_enabled).
This way we can't interpret NULL clocks as having valid and
interesting values.
