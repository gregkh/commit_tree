nilfs2: fix fix very long mount time issue

There exists a situation when GC can work in background alone without
any other filesystem activity during significant time.

The nilfs_clean_segments() method calls nilfs_segctor_construct() that
updates superblocks in the case of NILFS_SC_SUPER_ROOT and
THE_NILFS_DISCONTINUED flags are set.  But when GC is working alone the
nilfs_clean_segments() is called with unset THE_NILFS_DISCONTINUED flag.
As a result, the update of superblocks doesn't occurred all this time
and in the case of SPOR superblocks keep very old values of last super
root placement.

SYMPTOMS:

Trying to mount a NILFS2 volume after SPOR in such environment ends with
very long mounting time (it can achieve about several hours in some
cases).

REPRODUCING PATH:

1. It needs to use external USB HDD, disable automount and doesn't
   make any additional filesystem activity on the NILFS2 volume.

2. Generate temporary file with size about 100 - 500 GB (for example,
   dd if=/dev/zero of=<file_name> bs=1073741824 count=200).  The size of
   file defines duration of GC working.

3. Then it needs to delete file.

4. Start GC manually by means of command "nilfs-clean -p 0".  When you
   start GC by means of such way then, at the end, superblocks is updated
   by once.  So, for simulation of SPOR, it needs to wait sometime (15 -
   40 minutes) and simply switch off USB HDD manually.

5. Switch on USB HDD again and try to mount NILFS2 volume.  As a
   result, NILFS2 volume will mount during very long time.

REPRODUCIBILITY: 100%

FIX:

This patch adds checking that superblocks need to update and set
THE_NILFS_DISCONTINUED flag before nilfs_clean_segments() call.
