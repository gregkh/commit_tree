cgroup: use rculist ops for cgroup->children

Use RCU safe list operations for cgroup->children.  This will be used
to implement cgroup children / descendant walking which can be used by
controllers.

Note that cgroup_create() now puts a new cgroup at the end of the
->children list instead of head.  This isn't strictly necessary but is
done so that the iteration order is more conventional.
