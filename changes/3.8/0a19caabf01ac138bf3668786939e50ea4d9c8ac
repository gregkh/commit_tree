md: Use ->curr_resync as last completed request when cleanly aborting resync.

If a resync is aborted cleanly, ->curr_resync is a reliable
record of where we got up to.
If there was an error it is less reliable but we always know that
->curr_resync_completed is safe.

So add a flag MD_RECOVERY_ERROR to differentiate between these cases
and set recovery_cp accordingly.
