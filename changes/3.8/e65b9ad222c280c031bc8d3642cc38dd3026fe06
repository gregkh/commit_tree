lockdep, rwsem: fix down_write_nest_lock() if !CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC

Commit 1b963c81b145 ("lockdep, rwsem: provide down_write_nest_lock()")
contains a bug in a codepath when CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC is disabled,
which causes down_read() to be called instead of down_write() by mistake
on such configurations.  Fix that.
