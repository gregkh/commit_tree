powerpc/xmon: Merge start.c into nonstdio.c

The routines in start.c are only ever called from nonstdio.c, so if we
move them in there they can become static which is nice.

I suspect the idea behind the separation was that start.c could be
replaced in order to build xmon in userland. If anyone still cares about
doing that we could handle that with an ifdef or two.
