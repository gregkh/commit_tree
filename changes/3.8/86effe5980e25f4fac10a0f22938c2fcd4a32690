USB: fix build with XEN and EARLY_PRINTK_DBGP enabled but USB_SUPPORT disabled

Since there's no possible caller of dbgp_external_startup() and
dbgp_reset_prep() when !USB_EHCI_HCD, there's no point in building and
exporting these functions in that case. This eliminates a build error
under the conditions listed in the subject, introduced with the merge
f1c6872e4980bc4078cfaead05f892b3d78dea64.
