TTY: vt, fix paste_selection ldisc handling

There used to be a single tty_ldisc_ref_wait. But then, when a
big-tty-mutex (BTM) was introduced, it has to be tty_ldisc_ref +
tty_unlock + tty_ldisc_ref_wait + tty_lock. Later, BTM was removed
from that path and tty_ldisc_ref + tty_ldisc_ref_wait remained there.
But it makes no sense now. So leave there only tty_ldisc_ref_wait.

And when we have a reference to an ldisc, actually use it in the loop.
Otherwise it may be racy.
