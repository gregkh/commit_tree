x86: ce4100: allow second UART usage

The current CE4100 and 8250_pci code have both a limitation preventing the
registration and usage of CE4100's second UART. This patch changes the
platform code fixing up the UART port to work on a relative UART port
base address, as well as the 8250_pci code to make it register 2 UART ports
for CE4100 and pass the port index down to all consumers.
