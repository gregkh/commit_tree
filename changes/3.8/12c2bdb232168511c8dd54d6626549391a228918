block: prevent race/cleanup

Remove a race condition which causes a warning in disk_clear_events.  This
is a race between disk_clear_events() and disk_flush_events().
ev->clearing will be altered by disk_flush_events() even though we are
blocking event checking through disk_flush_events().  If this happens
after ev->clearing was cleared for disk_clear_events(), this can cause the
WARN_ON_ONCE() in that function to be triggered.

This change also has disk_clear_events() not go through a workqueue.
Since we have to wait for the work to complete, we should just call the
function directly.  Also, since this work cannot be put on a freezable
workqueue, it will have to contend with increased demand, so calling the
function directly avoids this.
