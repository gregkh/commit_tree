rtc: omap: add runtime pm support

OMAP1 RTC driver is used in multiple devices like, OMAPL138 and AM33XX.
Driver currently doesn't handle any clocks, which may be right for OMAP1
architecture but in case of AM33XX, the clock/module needs to be enabled
in order to access the registers.

So convert this driver to runtime pm, which internally handles rest.
