OMAPDSS: DISPC: Use output width and height to calculate row/pix inc for writeback

When calculating row and pixel increments for graphics and video pipes, we need
to consider the dimensions of the input frame to know how to read from the
buffer. Hence, we need to calculate these parameters from the input to the
pipeline.

For writeback, the row and pixel increments need to be calculated based on the
output of the writeback pipeline, i.e, the dimensions of the frame after
scaling. Ensure that dispc driver uses values of out_width and out_height when
calling calc_dma/calc_tiler_rotation_offset.

For graphics and video pipes, the original code passed the original height as
frame_height to calc_dma_rotation_offset, and not the predecimated height. This
is left as it is for now. We need to figure out why pre decimated height isn't
needed.
