packet: fix leakage of tx_ring memory

When releasing a packet socket, the routine packet_set_ring() is reused
to free rings instead of allocating them. But when calling it for the
first time, it fills req->tp_block_nr with the value of rb->pg_vec_len
which in the second invocation makes it bail out since req->tp_block_nr
is greater zero but req->tp_block_size is zero.

This patch solves the problem by passing a zeroed auto-variable to
packet_set_ring() upon each invocation from packet_release().

As far as I can tell, this issue exists even since 69e3c75 (net: TX_RING
and packet mmap), i.e. the original inclusion of TX ring support into
af_packet, but applies only to sockets with both RX and TX ring
allocated, which is probably why this was unnoticed all the time.
