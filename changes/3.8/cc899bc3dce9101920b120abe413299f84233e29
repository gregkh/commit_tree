Documentation: Fix historical inconsistency in STMPE DT doc

Previously a generic binding 'i2c-client-wake' was created which
enabled I2C devices to register themselves as wake-up devices.
This binding was later over-thrown by 'wakeup-source'. The STMPE
driver was fixed-up, but the document was neglected. This patch
aims to rectify that.
