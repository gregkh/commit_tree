random32: rename random32 to prandom

This renames all random32 functions to have 'prandom_' prefix as follows:

  void prandom_seed(u32 seed);	/* rename from srandom32() */
  u32 prandom_u32(void);		/* rename from random32() */
  void prandom_seed_state(struct rnd_state *state, u64 seed);
  				/* rename from prandom32_seed() */
  u32 prandom_u32_state(struct rnd_state *state);
  				/* rename from prandom32() */

The purpose of this renaming is to prevent some kernel developers from
assuming that prandom32() and random32() might imply that only
prandom32() was the one using a pseudo-random number generator by
prandom32's "p", and the result may be a very embarassing security
exposure.  This concern was expressed by Theodore Ts'o.

And furthermore, I'm going to introduce new functions for getting the
requested number of pseudo-random bytes.  If I continue to use both
prandom32 and random32 prefixes for these functions, the confusion
is getting worse.

As a result of this renaming, "prandom_" is the common prefix for
pseudo-random number library.

Currently, srandom32() and random32() are preserved because it is
difficult to rename too many users at once.
