ARM: OMAP3+: hwmod: Add AM33XX HWMOD data for davinci_mdio module

This patch adds hwmod entry for davinci MDIO module,
creating parent<->child relationship between CPSW and MDIO module.

This Parent-child relation is required in order to use common resources
like, clock, but still maintaining the logical separation between them.

CPGMAC SubSystem consist of various sub-modules, like, mdio, cpdma,
cpsw, etc... These sub-modules are also used in some of Davinci
family of devices, so separate and independent platform devices &
drivers for CPSW and MDIO is implemented.
In case of AM33XX, the resources are shared and common register
bit-field is provided to control module/clock enable/disable,
makes it difficult to handle common resources from both drivers.

So the solution is, create parent<->child relationship between
CPGMAC & MDIO modules.
