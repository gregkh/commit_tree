ACPICA: Fix unmerged utility divergences.

Utility improvements in ACPICA are partial ignored by ACPICA Linux
release.  This will lead to divergences between Linux and ACPICA.
This patch ports the entire "utility" into Linux and makes them
igored in the compilation stage by "ACPI_FUTURE_USAGE".
The following "Utility" files have been ported into the Linux:
  drivers/acpi/uttrack.c
  drivers/acpi/utcache.c
  drivers/acpi/utids.c

This patch will not affect the generated vmlinx binary.
This will decrease 274 lines of 20120913 divergence.diff.
