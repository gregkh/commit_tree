perf annotate: Don't try to follow jump target on PLT symbols

The perf annotate browser on TUI can identify a jump target for a
selected instruction.  It assumes that the jump target is within the
function but it's not the case of PLT symbols which have offset out of
the function as a target.

Since it caused a segmentation fault, do not try to follow jump target
on the PLT symbols.
