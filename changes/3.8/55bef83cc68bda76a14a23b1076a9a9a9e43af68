ISDN: capi, use kref from tty_port

After commit "TTY: move tty buffers to tty_port", the tty buffers are
not freed in some drivers. This is because tty_port_destructor is not
called whenever a tty_port is freed. This was an assumption I counted
with but was unfortunately untrue. So fix the drivers to fulfil this
assumption.

Here it is enough to switch to refcounting in tty_port.
