USB: EHCI: fix build error by making ChipIdea host a normal EHCI driver

This patch (as1627) splits the ehci-hcd core code, which has become a
separate library module, out from the ChipIdea host driver.  Instead
of #include-ing ehci-hcd.c directly, the ChipIdea module will now use
the ehci-hcd library in a normal fashion.

This fixes a build error caused by commit
3e0232039967d7a1a06c013d097458b4d5892af1 (USB: EHCI: prepare to make
ehci-hcd a library module); I had forgotten about the unorthodox way
the ChipIdea driver uses the ehci-hcd code.
