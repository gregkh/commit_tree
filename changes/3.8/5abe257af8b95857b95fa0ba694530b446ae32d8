revert "rtc: recycle id when unloading a rtc driver"

Revert commit 2830a6d20139df2198d63235df7957712adb28e5.

We already perform the ida_simple_remove() in rtc_device_release(),
which is an appropriate place.  Commit 2830a6d20 ("rtc: recycle id when
unloading a rtc driver") caused the kernel to emit

	ida_remove called for id=0 which is not allocated.

warnings when rtc_device_release() tries to release an alread-released
ID.

Let's restore things to their previous state and then work out why
Vincent's kernel wasn't calling rtc_device_release() - presumably a bug
in a specific sub-driver.
