drbd: allow to dequeue batches of work at a time

cherry-picked and adapted from drbd 9 devel branch

In 8.4, we still use drbd_queue_work_front(),
so in normal operation, we can not dequeue batches,
but only single items.

Still, followup commits will wake the worker
without explicitly queueing a work item,
so up() is replaced by a simple wake_up().
