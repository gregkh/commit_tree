mac80211: convert to channel definition struct

Convert mac80211 (and where necessary, some drivers a
little bit) to the new channel definition struct.

This will allow extending mac80211 for VHT, which is
currently restricted to channel contexts since there
are no drivers using that which makes it easier. As
I also don't care about VHT for drivers not using the
channel context API, I won't convert the previous API
to VHT support.
