cgroup: kill cgroup_subsys->__DEPRECATED_clear_css_refs

2ef37d3fe4 ("memcg: Simplify mem_cgroup_force_empty_list error
handling") removed the last user of __DEPRECATED_clear_css_refs.  This
patch removes __DEPRECATED_clear_css_refs and mechanisms to support
it.

* Conditionals dependent on __DEPRECATED_clear_css_refs removed.

* cgroup_clear_css_refs() can no longer fail.  All that needs to be
  done are deactivating refcnts, setting CSS_REMOVED and putting the
  base reference on each css.  Remove cgroup_clear_css_refs() and the
  failure path, and open-code the loops into cgroup_rmdir().

This patch keeps the two for_each_subsys() loops separate while open
coding them.  They can be merged now but there are scheduled changes
which need them to be separate, so keep them separate to reduce the
amount of churn.

local_irq_save/restore() from cgroup_clear_css_refs() are replaced
with local_irq_disable/enable() for simplicity.  This is safe as
cgroup_rmdir() is always called with IRQ enabled.  Note that this IRQ
switching is necessary to ensure that css_tryget() isn't called from
IRQ context on the same CPU while lower context is between CSS
deactivation and setting CSS_REMOVED as css_tryget() would hang
forever in such cases waiting for CSS to be re-activated or
CSS_REMOVED set.  This will go away soon.

v2: cgroup_call_pre_destroy() removal dropped per Michal.  Commit
    message updated to explain local_irq_disable/enable() conversion.
