new helper: current_user_stack_pointer()

	Cross-architecture equivalent of rdusp(); default is
user_stack_pointer(current_pt_regs()) - that works for almost all
platforms that have usp saved in pt_regs.  The only exception from
that is ia64 - we want memory stack, not the backing store for
register one.
