NFSv4.1: Ensure that the client tracks the server target_highest_slotid

Dynamic slot allocation in NFSv4.1 depends on the client being able to
track the server's target value for the highest slotid in the
slot table.  See the reference in Section 2.10.6.1 of RFC5661.

To avoid ordering problems in the case where 2 SEQUENCE replies contain
conflicting updates to this target value, we also introduce a generation
counter, to track whether or not an RPC containing a SEQUENCE operation
was launched before or after the last update.

Also rename the nfs4_slot_table target_max_slots field to
'target_highest_slotid' to avoid confusion with a slot
table size or number of slots.
