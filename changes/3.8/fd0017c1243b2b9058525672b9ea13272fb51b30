drbd: fix regression: potential NULL pointer dereference

recent commit
    drbd: always write bitmap on detach
introduced a bitmap writeout during detach,
which obviously needs some meta data device to write to.

Unfortunately, that same error path may be taken if we fail to attach,
e.g. due to UUID mismatch, after we changed state to D_ATTACHING,
but before the lower level device pointer is even assigned.

We need to test for presence of mdev->ldev.
