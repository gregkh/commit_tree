usb: musb: dsps: header movement build error fix

"54db6ee ARM: OMAP2+: Introduce local usb.h" moved control module bit
definitions from plat/usb.h (which dsps glue was using) to a local
header in mach-omap2. And in parallel,
"c68bb4c usb: musb: dsps: control module handling (quirk)" added
control module handling capability to dsps glue driver that used
those control module bit definitions.

Integration of above two changes would cause build error in musb dsps
glue driver (they go through different trees upstream) as is seen now
in linux-next. Fix it by adding necessary definitions in dsps glue
driver.
