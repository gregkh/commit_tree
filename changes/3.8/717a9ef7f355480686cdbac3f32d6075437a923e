tracing: Remove unneeded checks from the stack tracer

It seems that 'ftrace_enabled' flag should not be used inside the tracer
functions. The ftrace core is using this flag for internal purposes, and
the flag wasn't meant to be used in tracers' runtime checks.

stack tracer is the only tracer that abusing the flag. So stop it from
serving as a bad example.

Also, there is a local 'stack_trace_disabled' flag in the stack tracer,
which is never updated; so it can be removed as well.
