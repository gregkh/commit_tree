ipc: simplify message copying

Remove the redundant and confusing fill_copy().  Also add copy_msg()
check for error.  In this case exit from the function have to be done
instead of break, because further code interprets any error as EAGAIN.

Also define copy_msg() for the case when CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE is
disabled.
