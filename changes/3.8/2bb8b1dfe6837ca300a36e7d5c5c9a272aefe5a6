staging: comedi: addi_apci_1032: separate from addi_common.c

The addi_apci_1032 driver is a simple digital input board with 32
optically isolated inputs. Using the addi-data "common" code introduces
a lot of bloat.

Copy the code in addi_common.c to this driver and remove the #include
that caused addi_common.c to be compiled with this driver. This will
allow removing the special handling for allocating and freeing the
dma buffers in the common code.

Rename the attach_pci and detach functions so they have namespace
associated with this driver.
