ACPICA: AcpiExec: Improve algorithm for tracking memory leaks

Add some intelligence to the code that maintains the global
list of allocated memory. The list is now ordered by allocated
memory address, significantly improving performance.  When running
AcpiExec on the ASLTS test suite, speed improvements of 3X to 5X
are seen, depending on the platform and/or the environment.
