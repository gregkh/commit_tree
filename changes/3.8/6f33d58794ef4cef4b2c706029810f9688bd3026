__UNIQUE_ID()

Jan Beulich points out __COUNTER__ (gcc 4.3 and above), so let's use
that to create unique ids.  This is better than __LINE__ which we use
today, so provide a wrapper.

Stanislaw Gruszka <sgruszka@redhat.com> reported that some module parameters
start with a digit, so we need to prepend when we for the unique id.
