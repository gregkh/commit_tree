ASoC: da9055: DAPMise Headphone and Lineout enable controls

This patch DAPMises headphone and lineout output enable controls.

Earlier these output enable bits were permanently turned on in probe.
In da9055 codec, right outmixer is directly connected with right HP and
Line out. This resulted in two side effects,

(1) When you only want to use lineout, right HP (and connected charge
pump) also gets enabled

(2) When you only want to use stereo HP, lineout also gets enabled

This patch adds three switches to select which output(s) should be
enabled.
