sfc: Fix timekeeping in efx_mcdi_poll()

efx_mcdi_poll() uses get_seconds() to read the current time and to
implement a polling timeout.  The use of this function was chosen
partly because it could easily be replaced in a co-sim environment
with a macro that read the simulated time.

Unfortunately the real get_seconds() returns the system time (real
time) which is subject to adjustment by e.g. ntpd.  If the system time
is adjusted forward during a polled MCDI operation, the effective
timeout can be shorter than the intended 10 seconds, resulting in a
spurious failure.  It is also possible for a backward adjustment to
delay detection of a areal failure.

Use jiffies instead, and change MCDI_RPC_TIMEOUT to be denominated in
jiffies.  Also correct rounding of the timeout: check time > finish
(or rather time_after(time, finish)) and not time >= finish.
