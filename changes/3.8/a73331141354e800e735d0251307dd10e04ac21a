bcma: BCMA_DRIVER_GPIO should depend on GPIOLIB instead of selecting it

Commit cf0936b06d8e98a157630e99f647e2ff6d29d7ad ("bcma: add GPIO driver")
added BCMA_DRIVER_GPIO, which unconditionally selects GPIOLIB, causing
a Kconfig warning:

warning: (ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB && SSB_DRIVER_GPIO && BCMA_DRIVER_GPIO && MFD_TC6393XB && FB_VIA) selects GPIOLIB which has unmet direct dependencies (ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB || ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB)

and build failure for m68k/allmodconfig:

Turn the select into a dependency to fix this.
