gpiolib-of: staticize the pin range calls

Commit 69e1601bca88809dc118abd1becb02c15a02ec71
"gpiolib: provide provision to register pin ranges"

Declared the of_gpiochip_[add|remove]_pin_range() global
while they should be static as they are only ever used in
this file. Let's convert them to static.
