rcu: Accelerate callbacks for CPU initiating a grace period

Because grace-period initialization is carried out by a separate
kthread, it might happen on a different CPU than the one that
had the callback needing a grace period -- which is where the
callback acceleration needs to happen.

Fortunately, rcu_start_gp() holds the root rcu_node structure's
->lock, which prevents a new grace period from starting.  This
allows this function to safely determine that a grace period has
not yet started, which in turn allows it to fully accelerate any
callbacks that it has pending.  This commit adds this acceleration.
