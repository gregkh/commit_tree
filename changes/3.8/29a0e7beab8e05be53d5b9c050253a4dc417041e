ARM: tegra: retain L2 content over CPU suspend/resume

The L2 RAM is in different power domain from the CPU cluster. So the
L2 content can be retained over CPU suspend/resume. To do that, we
need to disable L2 after the MMU is disabled, and enable L2 before
the MMU is enabled. But the L2 controller is in the same power domain
with the CPU cluster. We need to restore it's settings and re-enable
it after the power be resumed.
