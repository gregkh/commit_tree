ARM: OMAP: Trivial driver changes to remove include plat/cpu.h

Drivers should not use cpu_is_omap or cpu_class_is_omap macros,
they should be private to the platform init code. And we'll be
removing plat/cpu.h and only have a private soc.h for the
arch/arm/*omap* code.

This patch is intended as preparation for the core omap changes
and removes the need to include plat/cpu.h from several drivers.
This is needed for the ARM common zImage support.

These changes are OK to do because:

- omap-rng.c does not need plat/cpu.h

- omap-aes.c and omap-sham.c get the proper platform_data
  passed to them so they don't need extra checks in the driver

- omap-dma.c and omap-pcm.c can test the arch locally as
  omap1 and omap2 cannot be compiled together because of
  conflicting compiler flags
