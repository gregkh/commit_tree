pktgen: clean up ktime_t helpers

Some years ago, the ktime_t helper functions ktime_now() and ktime_lt()
have been introduced. Instead of defining them inside pktgen.c, they
should either use ktime_t library functions or, if not available, they
should be defined in ktime.h, so that also others can benefit from them.
ktime_compare() is introduced with a similar notion as in timespec_compare().
