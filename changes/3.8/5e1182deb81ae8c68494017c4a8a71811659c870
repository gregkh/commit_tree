pidns: Don't allow new processes in a dead pid namespace.

Set nr_hashed to -1 just before we schedule the work to cleanup proc.
Test nr_hashed just before we hash a new pid and if nr_hashed is < 0
fail.

This guaranteees that processes never enter a pid namespaces after we
have cleaned up the state to support processes in a pid namespace.

Currently sending SIGKILL to all of the process in a pid namespace as
init exists gives us this guarantee but we need something a little
stronger to support unsharing and joining a pid namespace.
