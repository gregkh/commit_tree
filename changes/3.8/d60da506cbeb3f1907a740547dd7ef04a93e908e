tracing: Add a resize function to make one buffer equivalent to another buffer

Trace buffer size is now per-cpu, so that there are the following two
patterns in resizing of buffers.

  (1) resize per-cpu buffers to same given size
  (2) resize per-cpu buffers to another trace_array's buffer size
      for each CPU (such as preparing the max_tr which is equivalent
      to the global_trace's size)

__tracing_resize_ring_buffer() can be used for (1), and had
implemented (2) inside it for resetting the global_trace to the
original size.

(2) was also implemented in another place. So this patch assembles
them in a new function - resize_buffer_duplicate_size().
