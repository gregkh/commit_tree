x86, efi: remove attribute check from setup_efi_pci

It looks like the original commit that copied the rom contents from
efi always copied the rom, and the fixup in setup_efi_pci from commit
886d751a2ea99a160 ("x86, efi: correct precedence of operators in
setup_efi_pci") broke that.

This resulted in macbook pro's no longer finding the rom images, and
thus not being able to use the radeon card any more.

The solution is to just remove the check for now, and always copy the
rom if available.
