ARM: hw_breakpoint: fix ordering of debug register reset sequence

The debug register reset sequence for v7 and v7.1 is congruent with
tap-dancing through a minefield.

Rather than wait until we've blown ourselves to pieces, this patch
instead checks the debug_err_mask after each potentially faulting
operation. We also move the enabling of monitor_mode to the end of the
sequence in order to prevent spurious debug events generated by UNKNOWN
register values.
