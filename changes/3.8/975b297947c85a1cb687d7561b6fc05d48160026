drbd: fix potential spinlock deadlock

drbd_try_clear_on_disk_bm() has a sanity check for the number of blocks
left to be resynced (rs_left) in the current resync extent.
If it detects a mismatch, it complains, and forces a disconnect using
drbd_force_state(mdev, NS(conn, C_DISCONNECTING));

Unfortunately, this may be called while holding the req_lock,
and drbd_force_state() want's to aquire that lock itself. Deadlock.

Don't force a disconnect, but fix up rs_left by recounting and
reassigning the number of dirty blocks in that extent.
