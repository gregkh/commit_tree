xen/blkback: persistent-grants fixes

This patch contains fixes for persistent grants implementation v2:

 * handle == 0 is a valid handle, so initialize grants in blkback
   setting the handle to BLKBACK_INVALID_HANDLE instead of 0. Reported
   by Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk.

 * new_map is a boolean, use "true" or "false" instead of 1 and 0.
   Reported by Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk.

 * blkfront announces the persistent-grants feature as
   feature-persistent-grants, use feature-persistent instead which is
   consistent with blkback and the public Xen headers.

 * Add a consistency check in blkfront to make sure we don't try to
   access segments that have not been set.
