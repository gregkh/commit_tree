Btrfs: keep track of the extents original block length

If we've written to a prealloc extent we need to know the original block len
for the extent.  We can't figure this out currently since ->block_len is
just set to the extent length.  So introduce ->orig_block_len so that we
know how many bytes were in the original extent for proper extent logging
that future patches will need.  Thanks,
