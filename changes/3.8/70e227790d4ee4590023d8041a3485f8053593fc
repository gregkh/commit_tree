staging: vt6656: 64bit fixes: vCommandTimerWait change calculation of timer.

The timer appears to run too fast/race on 64 bit systems.

Using msecs_to_jiffies seems to cause a deadlock on 64 bit.

A calculation of (MSecond * HZ) / 1000 appears to run satisfactory.

Change BSSIDInfoCount to u32.

After this patch the driver can be successfully connect on little endian 64/32 bit systems.
