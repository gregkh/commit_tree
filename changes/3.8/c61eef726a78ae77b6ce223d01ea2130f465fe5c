drm: add support for monotonic vblank timestamps

Jumps in the vblank and page flip event timestamps cause trouble for
clients, so we should avoid them. The timestamp we get currently with
gettimeofday can jump, so use instead monotonic timestamps.

For backward compatibility use a module flag to revert back to using
gettimeofday timestamps. Add also a DRM_CAP_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC flag
that is simply a read only version of the module flag, so that clients
can query this without depending on sysfs.
