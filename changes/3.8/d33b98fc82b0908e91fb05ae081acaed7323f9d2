block: partition: msdos: provide UUIDs for partitions

The MSDOS/MBR partition table includes a 32-bit unique ID, often referred
to as the NT disk signature.  When combined with a partition number within
the table, this can form a unique ID similar in concept to EFI/GPT's
partition UUID.  Constructing and recording this value in struct
partition_meta_info allows MSDOS partitions to be referred to on the
kernel command-line using the following syntax:

root=PARTUUID=0002dd75-01
