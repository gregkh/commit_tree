nfsd: move the confirmed and unconfirmed hlists to a rbtree

The current code requires that we md5 hash the name in order to store
the client in the confirmed and unconfirmed trees. Change it instead
to store the clients in a pair of rbtrees, and simply compare the
cl_names directly instead of hashing them. This also necessitates that
we add a new flag to the clp->cl_flags field to indicate which tree
the client is currently in.
