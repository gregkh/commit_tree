staging: comedi: addi_apci_2032: remove use of struct addi_private

The only data in addi_private used in this driver is:

tsk_Current - used with send_sig to signal userspace when an interrupt
has occurred. Interrupt support in this driver does not follow the
standard comedi API so this functionality is currently broken. This
will be addressed.

b_OutputMemoryStatus - used in the addi-data "common" code to enable
reading of the eeprom. Eeprom support is not needed by this driver
and has been removed.

Since this data is not needed, remove the use of struct addi_private.
