rbd: get additional info in parent spec

When a layered rbd image has a parent, that parent is identified
only by its pool id, image id, and snapshot id.  Images that have
been mapped also record *names* for those three id's.

Add code to look up these names for parent images so they match
mapped images more closely.  Skip doing this for an image if it
already has its pool name defined (this will be the case for images
mapped by the user).

It is possible that an the name of a parent image can't be
determined, even if the image id is valid.  If this occurs it
does not preclude correct operation, so don't treat this as
an error.

On the other hand, defined pools will always have both an id and a
name.   And any snapshot of an image identified as a parent for a
clone image will exist, and will have a name (if not it indicates
some other internal error).  So treat failure to get these bits
of information as errors.
