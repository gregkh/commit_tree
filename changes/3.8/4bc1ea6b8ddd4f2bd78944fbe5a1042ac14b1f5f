xfs: remove xfs_flush_pages

It is a complex wrapper around VFS functions, but there are VFS
functions that provide exactly the same functionality. Call the VFS
functions directly and remove the unnecessary indirection and
complexity.

We don't need to care about clearing the XFS_ITRUNCATED flag, as
that is done during .writepages. Hence is cleared by the VFS
writeback path if there is anything to write back during the flush.
