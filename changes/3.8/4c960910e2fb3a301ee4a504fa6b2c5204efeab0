MIPS: AR724x: Fix AR724X_PCI_MEM_SIZE

The base address of the PCI memory is
0x10000000 and the base address of the
PCI configuration space is 0x14000000
on the AR724x SoCs.

The AR724X_PCI_MEM_SIZE is defined as
0x08000000 which is wrong because that
overlaps  with the configuration space.

The patch fixes the value of the
AR724X_PCI_MEM_SIZE constant, in order
to avoid this resource conflicts.
