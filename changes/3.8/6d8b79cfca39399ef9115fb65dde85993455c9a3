xfs: rename xfs_sync.[ch] to xfs_icache.[ch]

xfs_sync.c now only contains inode reclaim functions and inode cache
iteration functions. It is not related to sync operations anymore.
Rename to xfs_icache.c to reflect it's contents and prepare for
consolidation with the other inode cache file that exists
(xfs_iget.c).
