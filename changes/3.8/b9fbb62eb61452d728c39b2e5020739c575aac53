mfd: Only unregister platform devices allocated by the mfd core

mfd_remove_devices would iterate over all devices sharing a parent with
an mfd device regardless of whether they were allocated by the mfd core
or not. This especially caused problems when the device structure was
not contained within a platform_device, because to_platform_device is
used on each device pointer.

This patch defines a device_type for mfd devices and checks this is
present from mfd_remove_devices_fn before processing the device.
