drbd: on attach, enforce clean meta data

Detection of unclean shutdown has moved into user space.

The kernel code will, whenever it updates the meta data, mark it as
"unclean", and will refuse to attach to such unclean meta data.

"drbdadm up" now schedules "drbdmeta apply-al", which will apply
the activity log to the bitmap, and/or reinitialize it, if necessary,
as well as set a "clean" indicator flag.

This moves a bit code out of kernel space.
As a side effect, it also prevents some 8.3 module from accidentally
ignoring the 8.4 style activity log, if someone should downgrade,
whether on purpose, or accidentally because he changed kernel versions
without providing an 8.4 for the new kernel, and the new kernel comes
with in-tree 8.3.
