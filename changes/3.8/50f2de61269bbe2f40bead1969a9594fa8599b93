ARM: imx: include hardware.h rather than mach/hardware.h

It moves a bunch of header files included in hardware.h and itself
from mach-imx/include/mach to mach-imx, and updates users to include
hardware.h rather than mach/hardware.h.  The files in mach-imx/devices
will need to include "../hardware.h".
