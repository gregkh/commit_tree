pstore/ram: Fix undefined usage of rounddown_pow_of_two(0)

record_size / console_size / ftrace_size can be 0 (this is how you disable
the feature), but rounddown_pow_of_two(0) is undefined. As suggested by
Kees Cook, use !is_power_of_2() as a condition to call
rounddown_pow_of_two and avoid its undefined behavior on the value 0. This
issue has been present since commit 1894a253 (ramoops: Move to
fs/pstore/ram.c).
