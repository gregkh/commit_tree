time: remove the timecompare code.

This patch removes the timecompare code from the kernel. The top five
reasons to do this are:

1. There are no more users of this code.
2. The original idea was a bit weak.
3. The original author has disappeared.
4. The code was not general purpose but tuned to a particular hardware,
5. There are better ways to accomplish clock synchronization.
