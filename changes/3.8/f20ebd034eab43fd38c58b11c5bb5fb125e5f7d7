drm/nv17-50: restore fence buffer on resume

Since commit 5e120f6e4b3f35b741c5445dfc755f50128c3c44 "drm/nouveau/fence:
convert to exec engine, and improve channel sync" nouveau fence sync
implementation for nv17-50 and nvc0+ started to rely on state of fence buffer
left by previous sync operation. But as pinned bo's (where fence state is
stored) are not saved+restored across suspend/resume, we need to do it
manually.

nvc0+ was fixed by commit d6ba6d215a538a58f0f0026f0961b0b9125e8042
"drm/nvc0/fence: restore pre-suspend fence buffer context on resume".
