MIPS: Move processing of coherency kernel parameters earlier

Commit 97ce2c88f9ad42e3c60a9beb9fca87abf3639faa (jump-label: initialize
jump-label subsystem much earlier) caused MIPS to break, so this was
resolved with commit 6650df3c380e0db558dbfec63ed860402c6afb2a (MIPS:
Move cache setup to setup_arch().).  Unfortunately, after this commit,
the coherency kernel parameters, cca and coherentio, are no longer
processed before their values are used.

This patch fixes this problem by marking them as early_param, which
results in them being processed before they are needed.
