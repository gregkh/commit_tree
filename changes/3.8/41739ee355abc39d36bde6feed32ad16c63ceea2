asm-generic: io: don't perform swab during {in,out} string functions

The {in,out}s{b,w,l} functions are designed to operate on a stream of
bytes and therefore should not perform any byte-swapping, regardless of
the CPU byte order.

This patch fixes the generic IO header so that {in,out}s{b,w,l} call the
__raw_{read,write} functions directly rather than going via the
endian-correcting accessors.
