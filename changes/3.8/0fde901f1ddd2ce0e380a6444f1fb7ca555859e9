i915: ensure that VGA plane is disabled

Some broken systems (like HP nc6120) in some cases, usually after LID
close/open, enable VGA plane, making display unusable (black screen on LVDS,
some strange mode on VGA output). We used to disable VGA plane only once at
startup. Now we also check, if VGA plane is still disabled while changing
mode, and fix that if something changed it.
