Bluetooth: mgmt: Restrict BR/EDR settings to BR/EDR-only adapters

This patch makes sure that settings which are specific for BR/EDR
capable adapters are not allowed for non-BR/EDR (e.g. LE-only) adapters.
Instead, a "not supported" error is returned of such a setting is
attempted to be set for a non-BR/EDR adapter.
