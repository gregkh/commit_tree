bnx2x: Always take PHY lock

Taking PHY lock is not required on some older designs, but we are removing this
complication and always taking it since it is always required on newer designs
and does not worth the code complication on the older boards.

Taking PHY lock was initially required only on specific boards which had their
MDC/MDIO bus crossed, but since this lock is now always required, for example,
when NCSI is present, the PHY lock will always be taken.
