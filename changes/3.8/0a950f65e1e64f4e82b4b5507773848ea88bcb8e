cgroup: add cgroup->id

With the introduction of generic cgroup hierarchy iterators, css_id is
being phased out.  It was unnecessarily complex, id'ing the wrong
thing (cgroups need IDs, not CSSes) and has other oddities like not
being available at ->css_alloc().

This patch adds cgroup->id, which is a simple per-hierarchy
ida-allocated ID which is assigned before ->css_alloc() and released
after ->css_free().
