memcg: fix kmemcg registration for late caches

The designed workflow for the caches in kmemcg is: register it with
memcg_register_cache() if kmemcg is already available or later on when a
new kmemcg appears at memcg_update_cache_sizes() which will handle all
caches in the system.  The caches created at boot time will be handled
by the later, and the memcg-caches as well as any system caches that are
registered later on by the former.

There is a bug, however, in memcg_register_cache: we correctly set up
the array size, but do not mark the cache as a root cache.

This means that allocations for any cache appearing late in the game
will see memcg->memcg_params->is_root_cache == false, and in particular,
trigger VM_BUG_ON(!cachep->memcg_params->is_root_cache) in
__memcg_kmem_cache_get.

The obvious fix is to include the missing assignment.
