qlcnic: fix sparse warnings

qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17: warning: cast removes address space of expression
qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)
qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17:    expected void volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17:    got void *<noident>
qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17: warning: cast removes address space of expression
qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17:    expected void const volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
qlcnic_hw.c:1337:17:    got void *<noident>

The above warnings are originating from the macros QLCNIC_RD_DUMP_REG and
QLCNIC_WR_DUMP_REG.
The warnings are fixed and macros are replaced with equivalent functions
in the only file from where it is called.

The following warnings are fixed by making the functions static.

qlcnic_hw.c:543:5: warning: symbol 'qlcnic_set_fw_loopback' was not declared. Should it be static?
qlcnic_init.c:1853:6: warning: symbol 'qlcnic_process_rcv_diag' was not declared. Should it be static?
