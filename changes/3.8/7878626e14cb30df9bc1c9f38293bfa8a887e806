Staging: bcm: Remove unneeded do while loop in InterfaceRDM.

This patch removes an unneeded do while loop which
sends a control message to bcm usb device. In this case,
the loop executes once because usRetries is
initialized to zero. After the first iteration
this variable will be 1. Therefore, the statement:
"usRetries < MAX_RDM_WRM_RETIRES" will evaluate to
false causing the do while statement to execute
once because MAX_RDM_WRM_RETIRES is equal to 1.
