cfg80211: add support for flushing old scan results

Add an NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_FLUSH flag that causes old bss cache
entries to be flushed on scan completion. This is useful for
collecting guaranteed fresh scan/survey result (e.g. on resume).

For normal scan, flushing only happens on successful completion
of a scan; i.e. it does not happen if the scan is aborted.
For scheduled scan, previous scan results are flushed everytime
when we get new scan results.

This feature is enabled by default. Drivers can disable it by
unsetting the NL80211_FEATURE_SCAN_FLUSH flag.
