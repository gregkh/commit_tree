ARM: perf: check ARMv7 counter validity on a per-pmu basis

Multi-cluster ARMv7 systems may have CPU PMUs with different number of
counters.

This patch updates armv7_pmnc_counter_valid so that it takes a pmu
argument and checks the counter validity against that. We also remove a
number of redundant counter checks whether the current PMU is not easily
retrievable.
