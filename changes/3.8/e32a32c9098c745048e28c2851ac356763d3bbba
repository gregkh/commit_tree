staging: comedi: addi_apci_1516: cleanup addi_find_boardinfo()

This driver uses the comedi auto_config mechanism to attach to the
PCI board.

This mechanism does not require passing the boardinfo data in the
comedi_driver. Remove it and modify the code to directly access
the boardinfo data instead of messing with the dev->driver->board_name
pointer.

All the boards supported by this driver have the same PCI vendor id.
Remove this extra info from the boardinfo and the test for it.

Rename the function so it has namespace associated with this driver.
