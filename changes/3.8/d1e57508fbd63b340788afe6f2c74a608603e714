s390/topology: cleanup topology code

Mainly merge all different per-cpu arrays into a single array which
holds all topology information per logical cpu.
Also fix the broken core vs socket variable naming and simplify the
locking a bit.
When running in environments without topology information also
invent book, socket and core ids, so that not all ids are zero.
