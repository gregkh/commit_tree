ARM: OMAP: Don't restore DMTIMER interrupt status register

Restoring the timer interrupt status is not possible because writing a 1 to any
bit in the register clears that bit if set and writing a 0 has no affect.
Furthermore, if an interrupt is pending when someone attempts to disable a
timer, the timer will fail to transition to the idle state and hence it's
context will not be lost. Users should take care to service all interrupts
before disabling the timer.
