ixgbe: Fix possible memory leak in ixgbe_set_ringparam

We were not correctly freeing the temporary rings on error in
ixgbe_set_ring_param.  In order to correct this I am unwinding a number of
changes that were made in order to get things back to the original working
form with modification for the current ring layouts.

This approach has multiple advantages including a smaller memory footprint,
and the fact that the interface is stopped while we are allocating the rings
meaning that there is less potential for some sort of memory corruption on the
ring.

The only disadvantage I see with this approach is that on a Rx allocation
failure we will report an error and only update the Tx rings.  However the
adapter should be fully functional in this state and the likelihood of such
an error is very low.  In addition it is not unreasonable to expect the
user to need to recheck the ring configuration should they experience an
error setting the ring sizes.
