pata_cs5536: add quirk for broken udma

I am working on a device which uses the cs5536 pata driver. There
are some broken hardware revisions out in the field, which can be
detected via DMI. On older versions with an embedded BIOS I
used libata.dma=0 to disable dma completely.
Now we are switching to a coreboot/seabios based BIOS where we
have DMI support and so I think its a good idea to get rid of
all those hacky kernel parameters as the same image
is used other devices where libata.dma=0 is not a good idea.
