spi: Remove HOTPLUG section attributes

CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option.  As result the __dev*
markings will be going away.

Remove use of __devinit, __devexit_p, __devinitdata, __devinitconst,
and __devexit.

Bill Pemberton has done most of the legwork on this series. I've used
his script to purge the attributes from the drivers/gpio tree.
