drbd: distribute former syncer_conf settings to disk, connection, and resource level

This commit breaks the API again.

Move per-volume former syncer options into disk_conf.
Move per-connection former syncer options into net_conf.
Renamed the remainign sync_conf to res_opts

Syncer settings have been changeable at runtime, so we need to prepare
for these settings to be runtime-changeable in their new home as well.

Introduce new configuration operations, and share the netlink attribute
between "attach" (create new disk) and "disk-opts" (change options).
Same for "connect" and "net-opts".

Some fields cannot be changed at runtime, however.
Introduce a new flag GENLA_F_INVARIANT to be able to trigger on that in
the generated validation and assignment functions.
