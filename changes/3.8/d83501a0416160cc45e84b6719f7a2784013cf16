[media] omap3isp: Remove unneeded module memory address definitions

The OMAP3ISP_*_REG_OFFSET, OMAP3ISP_*_REG_BASE and OMAP3ISP_*_REG macros
are not needed. Remove them.
The only exception is the OMAP3ISP_HIST_REG_BASE address. Replace it
with the memory address received through platform resources.
