serial: ifx6x60: del_timer_sync must not be called in interrupt context.

This patch make use of del_timer instead of del_timer_sync in the
interrupt context.
The spi_timer function don't use any resources that may release after
running del_timer,
so using the del_timer is also safe and enough in this context.
