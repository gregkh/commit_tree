SERIAL: omap: don't read back LCR/MCR/EFR

There's really no reason to read back these registers while setting
the termios modes, provided we keep our cached copies up to date.
Remove these readbacks.

This has the benefit that we know that the EFR_ECB and MCR_TCRTLR
bits will always be clear, so we don't need to keep masking these
bits throughout the code.
