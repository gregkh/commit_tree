ia64: don't mess with ar_bspstore in kernel_thread()

the only thing we use that for is in copy_thread(), where the way
we set it will result in rbs_size being 0.  Just move that calculating
rbs_size and copying rbs to non-kernel-thread side of
if (user_mode(regs)) in copy_thread() and set rbs_size to 0 on
kernel thread side.
