ALSA: usb-audio: skip UAC2 EFFECT_UNIT

Current code mishandles the case where the device is a UAC2
and the bDescriptorSubtype is a UAC2 Effect Unit (0x07).
It tries to parse it as a Processing Unit (which is similar to two
other UAC1 units with overlapping subtypes), but since the structure
is different (See: 4.7.2.10, 4.7.2.11 in UAC2 standard), the parsing
is done incorrectly and prevents the device from initializing.
For now, just ignore the unit.
