Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for stLocalSFChangeIndicationAlt and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for
stLocalSFChangeIndicationAlt, changes the
name of the struct to bcm_change_indication,
and removes a comment. In addition, any
calls to typedef stLocalSFChangeIndicationAlt
are changed to call the struct directly.
