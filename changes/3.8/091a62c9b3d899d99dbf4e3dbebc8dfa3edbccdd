usb: musb: cppi_dma: drop '__init' annotation

This patch fixes the following:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x1e709c): Section mismatch in reference from the funct
ion dma_controller_create() to the function .init.text:cppi_controller_start()
The function dma_controller_create() references
the function __init cppi_controller_start().
This is often because dma_controller_create lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of cppi_controller_start is wrong.

This warning is there due to the deficiency in the commit 07a67bbb (usb: musb:
Make dma_controller_create __devinit).

Since the start() method is only called from musb_init_controller() which is
not annotated, drop '__init' annotation from cppi_controller_start() and also
cppi_pool_init() since it gets called from that function, to avoid another
section mismatch warning...
