MAINTAINERS: update email address for Timur Tabi

Timur Tabi no longer works for Freescale, so update the email address
and status for all of his maintained projects.

Also mark the QE library as orphaned, for lack of interest in
maintaining it.

The CS4270 driver is marked as "Odd Fixes" because appropriate hardware
is no longer available.
