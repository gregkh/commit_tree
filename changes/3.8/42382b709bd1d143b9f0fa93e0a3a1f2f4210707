rbd: do not allow remove of mounted-on image

There is no check in rbd_remove() to see if anybody holds open the
image being removed.  That's not cool.

Add a simple open count that goes up and down with opens and closes
(releases) of the device, and don't allow an rbd image to be removed
if the count is non-zero.

Protect the updates of the open count value with ctl_mutex to ensure
the underlying rbd device doesn't get removed while concurrently
being opened.
