CacheFiles: Implement invalidation

Implement invalidation for CacheFiles.  This is in two parts:

 (1) Provide an invalidation method (which just truncates the backing file).

 (2) Abort attempts to copy anything read from the backing file whilst
     invalidation is in progress.

Question: CacheFiles uses truncation in a couple of places.  It has been using
notify_change() rather than sys_truncate() or something similar.  This means
it bypasses a bunch of checks and suchlike that it possibly should be making
(security, file locking, lease breaking, vfsmount write).  Should it be using
vfs_truncate() as added by a preceding patch or should it use notify_write()
and assume that anyone poking around in the cache files on disk gets
everything they deserve?
