skb: report completion status for zero copy skbs

Even if skb is marked for zero copy, net core might still decide
to copy it later which is somewhat slower than a copy in user context:
besides copying the data we need to pin/unpin the pages.

Add a parameter reporting such cases through zero copy callback:
if this happens a lot, device can take this into account
and switch to copying in user context.

This patch updates all users but ignores the passed value for now:
it will be used by follow-up patches.
