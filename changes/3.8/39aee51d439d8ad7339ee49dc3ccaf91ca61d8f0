serial: omap: Make context_loss_cnt signed

get_context_loss_count returns an int however it is stored in
unsigned integer context_loss_cnt . This patch tries to make
context_loss_cnt int. So that in case of errors the value
(which may be negative) is not interpreted wrongly.

In serial_omap_runtime_resume in case of errors returned by
get_context_loss_count print a warning and do a restore.
