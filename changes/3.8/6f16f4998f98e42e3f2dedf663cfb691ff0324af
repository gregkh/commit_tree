ARM: 7628/1: head.S: map one extra section for the ATAG/DTB area

We currently use a temporary 1MB section aligned to a 1MB boundary for
mapping the provided device tree until the final page table is created.
However, if the device tree happens to cross that 1MB boundary, the end
of it remains unmapped and the kernel crashes when it attempts to access
it.  Given no restriction on the location of that DTB, it could end up
with only a few bytes mapped at the end of a section.

Solve this issue by mapping two consecutive sections.
