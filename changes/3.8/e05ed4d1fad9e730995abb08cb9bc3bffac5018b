swiotlb: Return physical addresses when calling swiotlb_tbl_map_single

This change makes it so that swiotlb_tbl_map_single will return a physical
address instead of a virtual address when called.  The advantage to this once
again is that we are avoiding a number of virt_to_phys and phys_to_virt
translations by working with everything as a physical address.

One change I had to make in order to support using physical addresses is that
I could no longer trust 0 to be a invalid physical address on all platforms.
So instead I made it so that ~0 is returned on error.  This should never be a
valid return value as it implies that only one byte would be available for
use.

In order to clarify things since we now have 2 physical addresses in use
inside of swiotlb_tbl_map_single I am renaming phys to orig_addr, and
dma_addr to tlb_addr.  This way is should be clear that orig_addr is
contained within io_orig_addr and tlb_addr is an address within the
io_tlb_addr buffer.
