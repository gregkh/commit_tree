8250/16?50: Add support for Broadcom TruManage redirected serial port

Add support for the UART device present in Broadcom TruManage capable
NetXtreme chips (ie: 5761m 5762, and 5725).

This implementation has a hidden transmit FIFO, so running in single-byte
interrupt mode results in too many interrupts.  The UART_CAP_HFIFO
capability was added to track this.  It continues to reload the THR as long
as the THRE and TSRE bits are set in the LSR up to a specified limit (1024
is used here).
