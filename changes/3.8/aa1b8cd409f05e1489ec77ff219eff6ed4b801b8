Btrfs: pass fs_info instead of root

A small number of functions that are used in a device replace
procedure when the operation is resumed at mount time are unable
to pass the same root pointer that would be used in the regular
(ioctl) context. And since the root pointer is not required, only
the fs_info is, the root pointer argument is replaced with the
fs_info pointer argument.
