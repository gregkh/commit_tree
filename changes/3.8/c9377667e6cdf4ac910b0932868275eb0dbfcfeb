PNP: Simplify setting of resources

This patch factors out the setting of PNP resources into one function which is
then reused for all PNP resource types.  This makes the code more concise and
avoids duplication.  The parameters "type" and "flags" are not used at the
moment but may be used by follow-up patches.  Placeholders for these patches
can be found in the comment lines that contain the "TBD" marker.

As the code does not make any changes to the ABI, no regressions are expected.

NB: While at it, support for bus type resources is added.
