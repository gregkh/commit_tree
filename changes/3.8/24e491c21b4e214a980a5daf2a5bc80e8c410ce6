Input: as5011 - use C99-style structure initializators

Convert the struct i2c_msg initialization to C99 format. This makes
maintaining and editing the code simpler. Also helps once other fields
like transferred are added in future.

Thanks to Julia Lawall <julia.lawall@lip6.fr> for automating the
conversion.
