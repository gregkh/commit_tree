Drivers: virtio: remove __dev* attributes.

CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option.  As a result, the __dev*
markings need to be removed.

This change removes the use of __devinit, __devexit_p, and __devexit
from these drivers.

Based on patches originally written by Bill Pemberton, but redone by me
in order to handle some of the coding style issues better, by hand.
