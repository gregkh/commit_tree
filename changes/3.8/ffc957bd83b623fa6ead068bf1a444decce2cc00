ARM: OMAP: Fix dmtimer reset for timer1

In commit e32f7ec2 (ARM: OMAP: Fix 32 kHz timer and modify GP timer to use GPT1)
a fix was added to prevent timer1 being reset in the function
omap_dm_timer_reset() because timer1 was being used as the system timer for
OMAP2 devices. Although timer1 is still used by most OMAP2+ devices as a system
timer, the function omap_dm_timer_reset() is now only being called for OMAP1
devices and OMAP1 does not use timer1 as a system timer. Therefore, remove the
check in omap_dm_timer_reset() so that timer1 is reset for OMAP1 devices.
