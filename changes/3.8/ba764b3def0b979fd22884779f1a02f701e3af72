ASoC: McASP: calculate values for channel size

Change davinci_config_channel_size() to derive the values for XSSZ and
XROT in DAVINCI_MCASP_[RT]XFMT_REG from the configured word length
rather than hard-coding them in a switch/case block.

Also, by directly passing the word length to
davinci_config_channel_size(), we can get rid of the
DAVINCI_AUDIO_WORD_* enum.
