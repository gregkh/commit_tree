ALSA: usb-audio: Fix kernel panic of Digidesign Mbox2 quirk

This patch is based on 3.8-rc1. It fixes two things:
1) A kernel panic caused by incorrect allocation of a u8 variable
   "bootresponse".
2) A noisy dmesg (urb status -32) caused by broken pipe to an
   invalid midi endpoint.

It is also a little cleaner because there is no need for a new
QUIRK_MIDI type as suggested by kernel developers, since the device
follows exactly the MIDIMAN protocol.
