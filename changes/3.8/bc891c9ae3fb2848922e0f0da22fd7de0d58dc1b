drbd: fix potential deadlock during bitmap (re-)allocation

The former comment arguing that GFP_KERNEL was good enough was wrong: it
did not take resize into account at all, and assumed the only path
leading here was the normal attach on a still secondary device, so no
deadlock would be possible.

Both resize on a Primary, or attach on a diskless Primary,
could potentially deadlock.

drbd_bm_resize() is called while IO to the respective device is
suspended, so we must use GFP_NOIO to avoid potential deadlock.
