mm: mempolicy: Add MPOL_MF_LAZY

NOTE: Once again there is a lot of patch stealing and the end result
	is sufficiently different that I had to drop the signed-offs.
	Will re-add if the original authors are ok with that.

This patch adds another mbind() flag to request "lazy migration".  The
flag, MPOL_MF_LAZY, modifies MPOL_MF_MOVE* such that the selected
pages are marked PROT_NONE. The pages will be migrated in the fault
path on "first touch", if the policy dictates at that time.

"Lazy Migration" will allow testing of migrate-on-fault via mbind().
Also allows applications to specify that only subsequently touched
pages be migrated to obey new policy, instead of all pages in range.
This can be useful for multi-threaded applications working on a
large shared data area that is initialized by an initial thread
resulting in all pages on one [or a few, if overflowed] nodes.
After PROT_NONE, the pages in regions assigned to the worker threads
will be automatically migrated local to the threads on 1st touch.
