    drm/i915: set phase sync pointer override enable before setting phase sync pointer

It turns out that this w/a isn't actually required on cpt/ppt and
positively harmful on ivb/ppt when using fdi B/C links - it results in
a black screen occasionally, with seemingfully everything working as
it should. The only failure indication I've found in the hw is that
eventually (but not right after the modeset completes) a pipe underrun
is signalled.

Big thanks to Arthur Runyan for all the ideas for registers to check
and changes to test, otherwise I couldn't ever have tracked this down!
