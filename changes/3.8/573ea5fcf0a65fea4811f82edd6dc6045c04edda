f2fs: resolve build failures

There exist two build failures reported by Randy Dunlap as follows.

(on i386)
 a. (config-r8857)
	ERROR: "f2fs_xattr_advise_handler" [fs/f2fs/f2fs.ko] undefined!

Key configs in (config-r8857) are as follows.
 CONFIG_F2FS_FS=m
 # CONFIG_F2FS_STAT_FS is not set
 CONFIG_F2FS_FS_XATTR=y
 # CONFIG_F2FS_FS_POSIX_ACL is not set

The error was occurred due to the function location that we made a mistake.
Recently we added a new functionality for users to indicate cold files
explicitly through xattr operations (i.e., f2fs_xattr_advise_handler).

This handler should have been added in xattr.c instead of acl.c in order
to avoid an undefined operation like in this case where XATTR is set and
ACL is not set.

 b. (config-r8855)
	fs/f2fs/file.c: In function 'f2fs_vm_page_mkwrite':
	fs/f2fs/file.c:97:2: error: implicit declaration of function
	'block_page_mkwrite_return'

Key config in (config-r8855) is CONFIG_BLOCK.

Obviously, f2fs works on top of the block device so that we should consider
carefully a sort of config dependencies.

The reason why this error was occurred was that f2fs_vm_page_mkwrite() calls
block_page_mkwrite_return() which is enalbed only if CONFIG_BLOCK is set.
