ARM: OMAP2+: PRM: create PRM reset source API for the watchdog timer driver

The OMAP watchdog timer driver needs to determine what caused the SoC
to reset for its GETBOOTSTATUS ioctl.  So, define a set of standard
reset sources across OMAP SoCs.  For OMAP2xxx, 3xxx, and 4xxx SoCs,
define mappings from the SoC-specific reset source register bits to
the standardized reset source IDs.  Create SoC-specific PRM functions
that read the appropriate per-SoC register and use the mapping to
return the standardized reset bits.  Register the SoC-specific PRM
functions with the common PRM code via prm_register().  Create a
function in the common PRM code, prm_read_reset_sources(), that
calls the SoC-specific function, registered during boot.

This patch does not yet handle some SoCs, such as AM33xx.  Those SoCs
were not handled by the code this will replace.
