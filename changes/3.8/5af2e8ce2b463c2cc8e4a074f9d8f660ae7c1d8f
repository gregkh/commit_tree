drbd: Fix completion of requests while the device is suspended

In various places (E.g. CONNECTION_LOST_WHILE_PENDING) the
RQ_COMPLETION_SUSP mask is passed in the clear set to mod_rq_state().

The issue was that it tried to clear the RQ_COMPLETION_SUSP bit
out of the state mask first, and eventuelly set it afterwards,
in the drbd_req_put_completion_ref() function.

Fixed that by moving the reference getting out of
drbd_req_put_completion_ref() into the mod_rq_state(), before the place
where the extra reference might be put.
