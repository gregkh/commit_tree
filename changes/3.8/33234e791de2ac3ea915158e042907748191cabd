regulator: core: Allow specific minimal selector for starting linear mapping

Some drivers (at least 3 drivers) have such variant of linear mapping that
the first few selectors are invalid and the reset are linear mapping.
Let's support this case in core.

This patch adds linear_min_sel in struct regulator_desc,
so we can allow specific minimal selector for starting linear mapping.
Then extends regulator_[map|list]_voltage_linear() to support this feature.

Note that for selectors less than min_linear_index, we need count them to
n_voltages so regulator_list_voltage() won't fail while checking the boundary
for selector before calling list_voltage callback.
