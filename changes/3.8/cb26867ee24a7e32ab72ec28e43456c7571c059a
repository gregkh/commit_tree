ARM: OMAP4: clock: Add 44xx data using common struct clk

This patch is output from updated omap hw data autogeneration scripts
mostly contributed by Mike Turquette, with some later fixes from me.
All data is added into a new cclock44xx_data.c file which will be
switched with clock44xx_data.c file in a later patch.

 omap2_clksel_find_parent_index(); reflowed macros; updated
 DEFINE_STRUCT_CLK_HW_OMAP macro to include clkdm_name;
 use macros for clksel mux+gate clocks; many other fixes]
