mm: mempolicy: Add MPOL_NOOP

This patch augments the MPOL_MF_LAZY feature by adding a "NOOP" policy
to mbind().  When the NOOP policy is used with the 'MOVE and 'LAZY
flags, mbind() will map the pages PROT_NONE so that they will be
migrated on the next touch.

This allows an application to prepare for a new phase of operation
where different regions of shared storage will be assigned to
worker threads, w/o changing policy.  Note that we could just use
"default" policy in this case.  However, this also allows an
application to request that pages be migrated, only if necessary,
to follow any arbitrary policy that might currently apply to a
range of pages, without knowing the policy, or without specifying
multiple mbind()s for ranges with different policies.
