mem-hotplug selftests: print failure status instead of cause make error

Original behavior:
  bash-4.1$ make -C memory-hotplug run_tests
  make: Entering directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/memory-hotplug'
  ./on-off-test.sh
  make: execvp: ./on-off-test.sh: Permission denied
  make: *** [run_tests] Error 127
  make: Leaving directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/memory-hotplug'

After applying the patch:
  bash-4.1$ make -C memory-hotplug run_tests
  make: Entering directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/memory-hotplug'
  /bin/sh: ./on-off-test.sh: Permission denied
  memory-hotplug selftests: [FAIL]
  make: Leaving directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/memory-hotplug'
