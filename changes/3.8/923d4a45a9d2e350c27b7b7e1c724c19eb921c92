ACPI: Add user space interface for identification objects

ACPI devices are glued with physical devices through _ADR object, ACPI
enumerated devices are identified with _UID object.  Currently we can
observe _HID/_CID through sysfs interfaces (hid/modalias), but there's
no way for us to check _ADR/_UID from user space.  This patch closes
this gap for ACPI developers and users.
