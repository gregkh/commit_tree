mfd: Differentiate between u8500 and u9540 TCDM address mapping

The TCDM mappings are quite different from u8500 to u9540. If these
aren't correctly specified for a given board, it will fail to boot.
Here we add the correct TCDM base for the u9540.

Please note that although this patch allows us to boot the u9540,
it doesn't provide us with full enablement. For that, another
patch-set will follow which completely re-vamps the way the PRCMU
is passed TCDM mappings.
