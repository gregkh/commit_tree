HID: hidraw: fix nonblock read return EAGAIN after device removed

When nonblock read the condition check (file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK) always be
true, signal_pending and device exist checking never get a chance to run, so
the user mode code always get EAGAIN even if device removed. move nonblock mode
checking to the last can fix this problem.
