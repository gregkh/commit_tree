ah4/esp4: set transport header correctly for IPsec tunnel mode.

IPsec tunnel does not set ECN field to CE in inner header when
the ECN field in the outer header is CE, and the ECN field in
the inner header is ECT(0) or ECT(1).

The cause is ipip_hdr() does not return the correct address of
inner header since skb->transport-header is not the inner header
after esp_input_done2(), or ah_input().
