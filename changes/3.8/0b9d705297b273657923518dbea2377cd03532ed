mm: numa: Support NUMA hinting page faults from gup/gup_fast

Introduce FOLL_NUMA to tell follow_page to check
pte/pmd_numa. get_user_pages must use FOLL_NUMA, and it's safe to do
so because it always invokes handle_mm_fault and retries the
follow_page later.

KVM secondary MMU page faults will trigger the NUMA hinting page
faults through gup_fast -> get_user_pages -> follow_page ->
handle_mm_fault.

Other follow_page callers like KSM should not use FOLL_NUMA, or they
would fail to get the pages if they use follow_page instead of
get_user_pages.
