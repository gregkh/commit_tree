    drm/i915/sdvo: Only use the SDVO pin if it is in the valid range

added a default fallback if BIOS provides an invalid pin mapping, but
failed to force GPIO bit-banging on it. Finish the job, and also clean up
the function a bit. With bit-banging, setting the gmbus speed has no
effect, so drop it.
