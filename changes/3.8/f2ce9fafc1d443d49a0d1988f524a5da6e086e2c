    drm/i915/sdvo: restore i2c adapter config on intel_sdvo_init() failures

As SDVOB and SDVOC are multiplexed on the same pin, if a chipset does
not have the second SDVO encoder, it will then remove the force-bit
setting on the common i2c adapter during teardown. All subsequent
attempts of trying to use GMBUS with SDVOB then fail.
