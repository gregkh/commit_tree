perf tools: Fix attributes for '{}' defined event groups

Fixing events attributes for groups defined via '{}'.

Currently 'enable_on_exec' attribute in record command and both
'disabled ' and 'enable_on_exec' attributes in stat command are set
based on the 'group' option. This eliminates proper setup for '{}'
defined groups as they don't set 'group' option.

Making above attributes values based on the 'evsel->leader' as this is
common to both group definition.

Moving perf_evlist__set_leader call within builtin-record ahead
perf_evlist__config_attrs call, because the latter needs possible group
leader links in place.
