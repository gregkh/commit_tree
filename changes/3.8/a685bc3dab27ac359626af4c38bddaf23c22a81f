MIPS: Remove unused smvp.h

This header was added in commit 39b8d5254246ac56342b72f812255c8f7a74dca9
(kernel.org) / b6e90cd0ae7a556080d9ea2ec1b8f6d9accad9d4 (lmo( ([MIPS] Add
support for MIPS CMP platform.).  None of the functions it declared were
ever included in the tree. Commit cb7f39d2bc5a20615d016dd86fca0fd233c13b5d
(kernel.org) / b6e90cd0ae7a556080d9ea2ec1b8f6d9accad9d4 (lmo) [MIPS] Remove
unused maltasmp.h.] removeed the sole file that included it because that
file was itself unused.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: The whole mess happened because somebody at MIPS
thought it was a good idea to rename VSMP ("Vitual SMP") to SMVP.  Which
is an IBMeque ETLA in contrast to VSMP, so public kernels as opposed to
MTI's inhouse kernels never followed suit.]
