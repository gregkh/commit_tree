ALSA: au88x0: fix incorrect left shift

vortex_wt_setdsout performs bit-negation on the bit position (wt&0x1f)
rather than on the resulting bitmask.  This code is never actually
invoked (vortex_wt_setdsout is always called with en=1), so this does
not currently cause any problem, and this patch is simply cleanup.
