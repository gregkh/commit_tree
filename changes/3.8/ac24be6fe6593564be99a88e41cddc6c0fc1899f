brcmfmac: use struct brcmf_if as interface object for fwil functions

The functions for communicating were given the net_device only because
its private data contained struct brcmf_if object. However, not all
firmware related interfaces will be associated with a net_device. To
accomodate provisioning firmware for such interfaces the struct
brcmf_if object will be passed to the fwil functions.
