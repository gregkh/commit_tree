cfg80211: use DS or HT operation IEs to determine BSS channel

Currently, mac80211 checks the DS params IE if present and
uses it for the (primary) BSS channel, instead of the one
that the frame was received on. This is particularly useful
in the 2.4 GHz band since a frame is often received on one
of the adjacent channels due to overlap.

Move this code to cfg80211 so other drivers also do this.

Additionally, on 5 GHz, in particular with some (possibly)
upcoming changes in 802.11ai and duplicate transmissions
when wider channels are used, something similar happens.
So if present, also use the (primary) channel information
contained in the HT operation IE.
