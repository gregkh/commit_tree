userns: make each net (net_ns) belong to a user_ns

The user namespace which creates a new network namespace owns that
namespace and all resources created in it.  This way we can target
capability checks for privileged operations against network resources to
the user_ns which created the network namespace in which the resource
lives.  Privilege to the user namespace which owns the network
namespace, or any parent user namespace thereof, provides the same
privilege to the network resource.
