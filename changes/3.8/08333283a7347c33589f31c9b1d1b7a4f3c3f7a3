Bluetooth: Add new l2cap_chan struct members for high speed channels

An L2CAP channel using high speed continues to be associated with a
BR/EDR l2cap_conn, while also tracking an additional hci_conn
(representing a physical link on a high speed controller) and hci_chan
(representing a logical link).  There may only be one physical link
between two high speed controllers.  Each physical link may contain
several logical links, with each logical link representing a channel
with specific quality of service.

During a channel move, the destination channel id, current move state,
and role (initiator vs. responder) are tracked and used by the channel
move state machine.  The ident value associated with a move request
must also be stored in order to use it in later move responses.

The active channel is stored in local_amp_id.
