ASoC: wm8994: Stop mic detection whenever we detect an open circuit

Jack detection will not do anything to help us detect a microphone when
there is a fault in the cable and the debounce we have is enough to avoid
getting an intermediate result so halt microphone detection when we detect
that one is not present.
