btrfs: Notify udev when removing device

Currently udev does not know about the device being removed from the
file system. This may result in the situation where we're unable to
mount the file system by UUID or by LABEL because the by-uuid and
by-label links may still point to the device which is no longer part of
the btrfs file system and hence does not have any btrfs super block.

It can be easily reproduced by the following:

mkfs.btrfs -L bugfs /dev/loop[0-6]
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/test
btrfs device delete /dev/loop0 /mnt/test
umount /mnt/test

mount LABEL=bugfs /mnt/test <---- this fails

then see:

ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/bugfs

which will still point to the /dev/loop0

We did not noticed this before because libblkid would send the udev
event for us when it notice that the link does not fit the reality,
however it does not do that anymore and completely relies on udev
information.

Fix this by sending the KOBJ_CHANGE event to the bdev kobject after
successful device removal.

Note that this does not affect device addition, because we will open the
device prior the addition from userspace and udev will notice that and
reread the device afterwards.
