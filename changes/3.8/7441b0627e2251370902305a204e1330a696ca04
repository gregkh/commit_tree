s390/pci: PCI hotplug support via SCLP

Add SCLP PCI configure/deconfigure and implement a PCI hotplug
controller (s390_pci_hpc). The hotplug controller creates a slot
for every PCI function in stand-by or configured state. The PCI
functions are named after the PCI function ID (fid). By writing to
the power attribute in /sys/bus/pci/slots/<fid>/power the PCI function
is moved to stand-by or configured state. If moved to the configured
state the device is automatically scanned by the s390 PCI layer.
