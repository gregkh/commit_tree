mac80211: make client powersave independent of interface type

This patch prepares mac80211 for a later implementation of mesh or
ad-hoc powersave clients.
The structures related to powersave (buffer, TIM map, counters) are
moved from the AP-specific interface structure to a generic structure
that can be embedded into any interface type.
The functions related to powersave are prepared to allow easy
extension with different interface types. For example with:

+ } else if (sta->sdata->vif.type == NL80211_IFTYPE_MESH_POINT) {
+         ps = &sdata->u.mesh.ps;

Some references to the AP's beacon structure are removed where they
were obviously not used.

The patch compiles without warning and has been briefly tested as AP
interface with one client in PS mode.
