ring-buffer: Fix NULL pointer if rb_set_head_page() fails

The function rb_set_head_page() searches the list of ring buffer
pages for a the page that has the HEAD page flag set. If it does
not find it, it will do a WARN_ON(), disable the ring buffer and
return NULL, as this should never happen.

But if this bug happens to happen, not all callers of this function
can handle a NULL pointer being returned from it. That needs to be
fixed.
