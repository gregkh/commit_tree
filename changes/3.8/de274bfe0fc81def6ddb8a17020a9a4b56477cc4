TTY: introduce tty_port_destroy

After commit "TTY: move tty buffers to tty_port", the tty buffers are
not freed in some drivers. This is because tty_port_destructor is not
called whenever a tty_port is freed. This was an assumption I counted
with but was unfortunately untrue.

Those using refcounting are safe now, but for those which do not we
introduce a function to be called right before the tty_port is freed
by the drivers.
