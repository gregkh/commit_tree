carl9170: explain why sta cannot be NULL for ampdus

Dan Carpenter reported that smatch detected a potential
problem with the code [1]:
 drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:1488 carl9170_op_tx()
  error: we previously assumed 'sta' could be null (see line 1482)

 drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c
  1482  if (sta) {
           ^^^^^ New check.
  [...]
  1485  }
  1487  if (info->flags & IEEE80211_TX_CTL_AMPDU) {
  1488    run = carl9170_tx_ampdu_queue(ar, sta, skb);
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Old dereference of "sta" inside the call to carl9170_tx_ampdu_queue().

A range of solutions have been discussed in [2] and
we agreed on the following: "
> we might as well add a comment to carl9170_tx_ampdu_queue

> human reader]. This way we can save the "if"... which is

Putting a comment there is fine. Without the comment
it's easy for a human reader to get confused why the
check is there. So long as humans can read the code,
that's all that matters."
