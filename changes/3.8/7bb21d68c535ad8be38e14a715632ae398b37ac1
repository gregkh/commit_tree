libceph: socket can close in any connection state

A connection's socket can close for any reason, independent of the
state of the connection (and without irrespective of the connection
mutex).  As a result, the connectino can be in pretty much any state
at the time its socket is closed.

Handle those other cases at the top of con_work().  Pull this whole
block of code into a separate function to reduce the clutter.
