xfs: create helper to check whether to free eofblocks on inode

This check is used in multiple places to determine whether we
should check for (and potentially free) post EOF blocks on an
inode. Add a helper to consolidate the check.

Note that when we remove an inode from the cache (xfs_inactive()),
we are required to trim post-EOF blocks even if the inode is marked
preallocated or append-only to maintain correct space accounting.
The 'force' parameter to xfs_can_free_eofblocks() specifies whether
we should ignore the prealloc/append-only status of the inode.
