/proc/pid/status: add "Seccomp" field

It is currently impossible to examine the state of seccomp for a given
process.  While attaching with gdb and attempting "call
prctl(PR_GET_SECCOMP,...)" will work with some situations, it is not
reliable.  If the process is in seccomp mode 1, this query will kill the
process (prctl not allowed), if the process is in mode 2 with prctl not
allowed, it will similarly be killed, and in weird cases, if prctl is
filtered to return errno 0, it can look like seccomp is disabled.

When reviewing the state of running processes, there should be a way to
externally examine the seccomp mode.  ("Did this build of Chrome end up
using seccomp?" "Did my distro ship ssh with seccomp enabled?")

This adds the "Seccomp" line to /proc/$pid/status.
