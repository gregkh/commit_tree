ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for Focusrite Scarlett 18i6

Probing this device currently fails in snd_usb_audio_probe() because
the call to snd_usb_create_mixer() fails.  This is due to unknown or
non-standard interface descriptor subtypes in parse_audio_unit():

  usbaudio: unit 51: unexpected type 0x09
  snd-usb-audio: probe of 1-8:1.0 failed with error -5

Some people are working around this by recompiling usb-audio with the
call to snd_usb_create_mixer() commented out.  It would be nice to
avoid that.

While the best idea would be to look into the mixer creation failure,
a reasonable short-term solution is to use quirks to only probe the
trouble-free interfaces.  This allows audio and MIDI interfaces to be
used without any obvious issues.

Interface 0 is the main one to ignore.  It contains lots of
control-fu, including the unexpected interface descriptor subtypes.
Interface 5 is for firmware updates and I'm not sure how to get
support for this.  Interface 3 is some sort of control interface that
I don't understand:

    Interface Descriptor:
      bLength                 9
      bDescriptorType         4
      bInterfaceNumber        3
      bAlternateSetting       0
      bNumEndpoints           0
      bInterfaceClass         1 Audio
      bInterfaceSubClass      1 Control Device
      bInterfaceProtocol      0
      iInterface              0
      AudioControl Interface Descriptor:
        bLength                 9
        bDescriptorType        36
        bDescriptorSubtype      1 (HEADER)
        bcdADC               1.00
        wTotalLength            9
        bInCollection           1
        baInterfaceNr( 0)       1
