MIPS: Netlogic: PIC IRQ handling update for multi-chip

Create struct nlm_pic_irq for interrupts handled by the PIC.
This simplifies IRQ handling for multi-SoC as well as
the single SoC cases. Also split the setup of percpu and PIC
interrupts so that we can configure the PIC interrupts for
every node.
