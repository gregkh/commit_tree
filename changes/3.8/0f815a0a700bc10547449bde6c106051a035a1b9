USB: UHCI: fix IRQ race during initialization

This patch (as1644) fixes a race that occurs during startup in
uhci-hcd.  If the IRQ line is shared with other devices, it's possible
for the handler routine to be called before the data structures are
fully initialized.

The problem is fixed by adding a check to the IRQ handler routine.  If
the initialization hasn't finished yet, the routine will return
immediately.
