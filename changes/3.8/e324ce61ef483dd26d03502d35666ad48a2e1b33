Input: gpio_keys - defer probing if GPIO probing is deferred

If of_get_gpio_flags() returns an error (as in case when GPIO probe is
deferred) the driver would attempt to claim invalid GPIO. It should
propagate the error code up the stack instead so that the probe either
fails or will be retried later (in case of -EPROBE_DEFER).
