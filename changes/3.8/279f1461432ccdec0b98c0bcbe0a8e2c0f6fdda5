x86: apic: Use tsc deadline for oneshot when available

If the TSC deadline mode is supported, LAPIC timer one-shot mode can be
implemented using IA32_TSC_DEADLINE MSR. An interrupt will be generated
when the TSC value equals or exceeds the value in the IA32_TSC_DEADLINE
MSR.

This enables us to skip the APIC calibration during boot. Also, in
xapic mode, this enables us to skip the uncached apic access to re-arm
the APIC timer.

As this timer ticks at the high frequency TSC rate, we use the
TSC_DIVISOR (32) to work with the 32-bit restrictions in the
clockevent API's to avoid 64-bit divides etc (frequency is u32 and
"unsigned long" in the set_next_event(), max_delta limits the next
event to 32-bit for 32-bit kernel).
