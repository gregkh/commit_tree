percpu_rw_semaphore: add lockdep annotations

Add lockdep annotations.  Not only this can help to find the potential
problems, we do not want the false warnings if, say, the task takes two
different percpu_rw_semaphore's for reading.  IOW, at least ->rw_sem
should not use a single class.

This patch exposes this internal lock to lockdep so that it represents the
whole percpu_rw_semaphore.  This way we do not need to add another "fake"
->lockdep_map and lock_class_key.  More importantly, this also makes the
output from lockdep much more understandable if it finds the problem.

In short, with this patch from lockdep pov percpu_down_read() and
percpu_up_read() acquire/release ->rw_sem for reading, this matches the
actual semantics.  This abuses __up_read() but I hope this is fine and in
fact I'd like to have down_read_no_lockdep() as well,
percpu_down_read_recursive_readers() will need it.
