spi/pl022: Activate resourses before deactivate them in suspend

To be able to deactivate resourses in suspend, the resourses must
first be surely active. This is done with a pm_runtime_get_sync.
Once the resourses are restored to active state again in resume,
the runtime pm usage count can be decreased with a pm_runtime_put.
