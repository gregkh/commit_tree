vfs: Only support slave subtrees across different user namespaces

Sharing mount subtress with mount namespaces created by unprivileged
users allows unprivileged mounts created by unprivileged users to
propagate to mount namespaces controlled by privileged users.

Prevent nasty consequences by changing shared subtrees to slave
subtress when an unprivileged users creates a new mount namespace.
