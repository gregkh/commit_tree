ALSA: usb-audio: USB audio quirk for Roland VG-99 advanced mode

Without this quirk the VG-99 will work in standard mode (set under
USB on System menu page 2) giving 16 bits at 44.1 Khz audio in/out
but no midi, and is not recognised when set to advanced mode.

After applying this, I can also use the VG-99 in advanced mode: 24
24 bits audio in/out at 44.1 Khz, and midi in/out. Sysex is so far
untested.

In standard mode, the device appears with ID 0x00b3, so the
behaviour isn't affected by this quirk.

Thanks to Clemens Ladisch for simplifying and correcting my initial
attempt!
