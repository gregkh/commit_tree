dm raid: round region_size to power of two

If the user does not supply a bitmap region_size to the dm raid target,
a reasonable size is computed automatically.  If this is not a power of 2,
the md code will report an error later.

This patch catches the problem early and rounds the region_size to the
next power of two.
