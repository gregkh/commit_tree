mmc: sdio: Use multiple scatter/gather list

Before this patch, we always used only single sg entry for SDIO transfer.
This patch switches to using multiple sg entries. In the case of dwmci,
it supports only up to 4KB size per single sg entry. So if we want to
transfer more than 4KB, we should send more than 1 command.

When we tested before applying this patch, it took around 335 us for
5K(5120) bytes transfer with dwmci controller. After applying this patch,
it takes 242 us for 5K bytes. So this patch makes around 38% performance
improvement for 5K bytes transfer. If the transfer size is bigger, then
the performance improvement ratio will be increased.
