s390/mm: keep fault_init() private to fault.c

Just convert fault_init() to an early initcall. That's still early
enough since it only needs be called before user space processes get
executed. No reason to externalize it.
Also add the function to the init section and move the store_indication
variable to the read_mostly section.
