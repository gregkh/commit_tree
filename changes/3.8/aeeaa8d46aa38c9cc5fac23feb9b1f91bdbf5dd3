efivarfs: Return a consistent error when efivarfs_get_inode() fails

Instead of returning -ENOSPC if efivarfs_get_inode() fails we should
be returning -ENOMEM, since running out of memory is the only reason
it can fail.  Furthermore, that's the error value used everywhere else
in this file. It's also less likely to confuse users that hit this
error case.
