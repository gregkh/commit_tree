xen-pciback: simplify and tighten parsing of device IDs

Now that at least one of the conformance problems of the kernel's
sscanf() was addressed (commit da99075c1d368315e1508b6143226c0d27b621e0),
we can improve the parsing done in xen-pciback both in terms of code
readability and correctness (in particular properly rejecting input
strings not well formed).
