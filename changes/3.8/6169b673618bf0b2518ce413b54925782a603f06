ALSA: hda - Always turn on pins for HDMI/DP

We've seen the broken HDMI *video* output on some machines with GM965,
and the debugging session pointed that the culprit is the disabled
audio output pins.  Toggling these pins dynamically on demand caused
flickering of HDMI TV.

This patch changes the behavior to keep the pin ON constantly.
