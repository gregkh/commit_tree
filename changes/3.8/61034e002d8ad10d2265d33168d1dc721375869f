staging: comedi: addi_apci_2032: cleanup the s->subdev_flags

The flags SDF_GROUND and SDF_COMMON only have meaning for analog
input/output subdevices. Remove these flags from the digital
output and timer subdevices in this driver.

The digital output subdevice does not need the SDF_READABLE flag.
Remove it.
