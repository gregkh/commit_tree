rbd: don't pass rbd_dev to rbd_get_client()

The only reason rbd_dev is passed to rbd_get_client() is so its
rbd_client field can get assigned.  Instead, just return the
rbd_client pointer as a result and have the caller do the
assignment.

Change rbd_put_client() so it takes an rbd_client structure,
so follows the more typical symmetry with rbd_get_client().
