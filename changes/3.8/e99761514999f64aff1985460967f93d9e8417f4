Btrfs: only log the inode item if we can get away with it

Currently we copy all the file information into the log, inode item, the
refs, xattrs etc.  Except most of this doesn't change from fsync to fsync,
just the inode item changes.  So set a flag if an xattr changes or a link is
added, and otherwise only log the inode item.  Thanks,
