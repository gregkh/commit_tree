ARM: OMAP4: OPP: add OMAP4460 definitions

Add OMAP4460 OPP definitions for voltage and frequencies based on
OMAP4460 ES1.0 DM Operating Condition Addendum Version 0.1

The following exceptions are present:
* Smartreflex support is still on experimental mode: the gains and min
  limits are currently pending characterization data. Currently OMAP4430 values
  are used.
* Efuse offset for core OPP100-OV setting is not clear in documentation.
* IVA OPPs beyond OPP100 are disabled due to the delta between max OMAP4460
  current requirements and Phoenix Max supply on VCORE2 in the default
  configuration - boards which have supply which can support this should
  explicitly call opp_enable and enable the same.
* MPU OPPs > OPPTURBO can easily be detected using a efuse burnt - currently
  disabled pending clock changes to support DCC feature.
