drbd: fix drbd_delete_device: remove vnr from volumes; idr_remove(); synchronize_rcu(); before cleanup

Still missing: rcu_readlock() on the various call sites that
access/iterate over those idrs.

We don't need a specific write lock, as we only modify from
configuration context, which is already strictly serialized.
