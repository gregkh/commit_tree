mm: introduce new field "managed_pages" to struct zone

Currently a zone's present_pages is calcuated as below, which is
inaccurate and may cause trouble to memory hotplug.

	spanned_pages - absent_pages - memmap_pages - dma_reserve.

During fixing bugs caused by inaccurate zone->present_pages, we found
zone->present_pages has been abused.  The field zone->present_pages may
have different meanings in different contexts:

1) pages existing in a zone.
2) pages managed by the buddy system.

For more discussions about the issue, please refer to:

  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1346751/

This patchset tries to introduce a new field named "managed_pages" to
struct zone, which counts "pages managed by the buddy system".  And revert
zone->present_pages to count "physical pages existing in a zone", which
also keep in consistence with pgdat->node_present_pages.

We will set an initial value for zone->managed_pages in function
free_area_init_core() and will adjust it later if the initial value is
inaccurate.

For DMA/normal zones, the initial value is set to:

	(spanned_pages - absent_pages - memmap_pages - dma_reserve)

Later zone->managed_pages will be adjusted to the accurate value when the
bootmem allocator frees all free pages to the buddy system in function
free_all_bootmem_node() and free_all_bootmem().

The bootmem allocator doesn't touch highmem pages, so highmem zones'
managed_pages is set to the accurate value "spanned_pages - absent_pages"
in function free_area_init_core() and won't be updated anymore.

This patch also adds a new field "managed_pages" to /proc/zoneinfo
and sysrq showmem.
