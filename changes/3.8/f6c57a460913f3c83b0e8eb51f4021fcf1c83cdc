batman-adv: Mark correctly aligned headers not as __packed

Headers which are already perfectly aligned and create a 4 byte boundary
non-ethernet header payload can have the __packed attribute removed. The
__packed attribute doesn't change the appeareance of the packet for these
headers because no extra padding is necessary to align the data members. The
compiler will also create slightly faster code for loads of multi-byte members.
