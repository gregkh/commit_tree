xen/acpi: ACPI PAD driver

PAD is acpi Processor Aggregator Device which provides a control point
that enables the platform to perform specific processor configuration
and control that applies to all processors in the platform.

This patch is to implement Xen acpi pad logic. When running under Xen
virt platform, native pad driver would not work. Instead Xen pad driver,
a self-contained and thin logic level, would take over acpi pad logic.

When acpi pad notify OSPM, xen pad logic intercept and parse _PUR object
to get the expected idle cpu number, and then hypercall to hypervisor.
Xen hypervisor would then do the rest work, say, core parking, to idle
specific number of cpus on its own policy.
