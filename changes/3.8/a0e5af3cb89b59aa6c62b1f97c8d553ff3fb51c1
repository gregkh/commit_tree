cpufreq: governors: Fix jiffies/cputime mixup (revisited)

This change was made by commit 8636fd2 (cpufreq: fix jiffies/cputime
mixup in conservative/ondemand governors) before, but then it has
been reverted inadvertently by commit 4471a34 (cpufreq: governors:
remove redundant code).

The changelog of commit 8636fd2's says:

  The function get_cpu_idle_time_jiffy in both the conservative and
  ondemand governors use jiffies_to_usecs to convert a cputime value
  to usecs which gives the wrong value on architectures where cputime
  and jiffies use different units.  Only matters if NO_HZ is
  disabled, since otherwise get_cpu_idle_time_us should already
  return a valid value, and get_cpu_idle_time_jiffy isn't actually
  called.

Since now we have only one common get_cpu_idle_time_jiffy() used by
both governors in question, modify it along the lines of commit
8636fd2 to restore the correct behavior.
