thp, vmstat: implement HZP_ALLOC and HZP_ALLOC_FAILED events

hzp_alloc is incremented every time a huge zero page is successfully
	allocated. It includes allocations which where dropped due
	race with other allocation. Note, it doesn't count every map
	of the huge zero page, only its allocation.

hzp_alloc_failed is incremented if kernel fails to allocate huge zero
	page and falls back to using small pages.
