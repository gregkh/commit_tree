ipv4/route/rtnl: get mcast attributes when dst is multicast

Commit f1ce3062c538 (ipv4: Remove 'rt_dst' from 'struct rtable') removes the
call to ipmr_get_route(), which will get multicast parameters of the route.

I revert the part of the patch that remove this call. I think the goal was only
to get rid of rt_dst field.

The patch is only compiled-tested. My first idea was to remove ipmr_get_route()
because rt_fill_info() was the only user, but it seems the previous patch cleans
the code a bit too much ;-)
