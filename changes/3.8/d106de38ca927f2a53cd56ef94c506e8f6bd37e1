ARM: 7614/1: mm: fix wrong branch from Cortex-A9 to PJ4b

If CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM & CONFIG_ARCH_MVEBU are both enabled,
__v7_pj4b_setup is added between __v7_ca9mp_setup and __v7_setup.

But there's no jump instruction added. If the chip is Cortex A5/A9,
it goes through __v7_pj4b_setup also. It results in system hang.
