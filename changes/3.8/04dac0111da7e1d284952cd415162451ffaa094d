netfilter: nf_conntrack: improve nf_conn object traceability

This patch modifies the conntrack subsystem so that all existing
allocated conntrack objects can be found in any of the following
places:

* the hash table, this is the typical place for alive conntrack objects.
* the unconfirmed list, this is the place for newly created conntrack objects
  that are still traversing the stack.
* the dying list, this is where you can find conntrack objects that are dying
  or that should die anytime soon (eg. once the destroy event is delivered to
  the conntrackd daemon).

Thus, we make sure that we follow the track for all existing conntrack
objects. This patch, together with some extension of the ctnetlink interface
to dump the content of the dying and unconfirmed lists, will help in case
to debug suspected nf_conn object leaks.
