staging: comedi: addi_apci_1032: remove unnecessary eeprom code

Now that this driver is separate from the "common" addi-data code,
the eeprom does not contain any information required to make this
driver work.

Remove the unneeded initalization of the 's_EeParameters' and the
code that reads the eeprom to fill in the parameters.

Also, since reading the eeprom is not really interesting, remove
the EEPROM subdevice.
