net: cdc_ncm: map MBIM IPS SessionID to VLAN ID

MBIM devices can support up to 256 independent IP Streams.
The main network device will only handle SessionID 0. Mapping
SessionIDs 1 to 255 to VLANs using the SessionID as VLAN ID
allow userspace to use these streams with traditional tools
like vconfig.
