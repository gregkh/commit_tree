cpupower tools: Fix warning and a bug with the cpu package count

The pkgs member of cpupower_topology is being used as the number of
cpu packages. As the comment in get_cpu_topology notes, the package ids
are not guaranteed to be contiguous. So, simply setting pkgs to the value
of the highest physical_package_id doesn't actually provide a count of
the number of cpu packages. Instead, calculate pkgs by setting it to
the number of distinct physical_packge_id values which is pretty easy
to do after the core_info structs are sorted. Calculating pkgs this
way also has the nice benefit of getting rid of a sign comparison warning
that GCC 4.6 was reporting.
