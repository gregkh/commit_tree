cpufreq: Move common part from governors to separate file, v2

Multiple cpufreq governers have defined similar get_cpu_idle_time_***()
routines. These routines must be moved to some common place, so that all
governors can use them.

So moving them to cpufreq_governor.c, which seems to be a better place for
keeping these routines.
