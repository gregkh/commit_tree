asm-generic: io: remove {read,write} string functions

The {read,write}s{b,w,l} functions are not defined across all
architectures and therefore shouldn't be used by portable drivers. We
should encourage driver writers to use the io{read,write}{8,16,32}_rep
functions instead.

This patch removes the {read,write} string functions for the generic IO
header as they have no place in a new architecture port.
