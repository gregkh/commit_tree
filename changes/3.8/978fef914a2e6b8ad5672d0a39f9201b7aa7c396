ext4: create __ext4_insert_dentry for dir entry insertion

The old add_dirent_to_buf handles all the work related to the
work of adding dir entry to a dir block. Now we have inline data,
so create 2 new function __ext4_find_dest_de and __ext4_insert_dentry
that do the real work and let add_dirent_to_buf call them.
