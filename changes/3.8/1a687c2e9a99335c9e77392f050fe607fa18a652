mm: sched: numa: Control enabling and disabling of NUMA balancing

This patch adds Kconfig options and kernel parameters to allow the
enabling and disabling of automatic NUMA balancing. The existance
of such a switch was and is very important when debugging problems
related to transparent hugepages and we should have the same for
automatic NUMA placement.
