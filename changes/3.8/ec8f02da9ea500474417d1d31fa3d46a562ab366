random: prime last_data value per fips requirements

The value stored in last_data must be primed for FIPS 140-2 purposes. Upon
first use, either on system startup or after an RNDCLEARPOOL ioctl, we
need to take an initial random sample, store it internally in last_data,
then pass along the value after that to the requester, so that consistency
checks aren't being run against stale and possibly known data.
