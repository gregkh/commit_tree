NFS: Add sequence_priviliged_ops for nfs4_proc_sequence()

If I mount an NFS v4.1 server to a single client multiple times and then
run xfstests over each mountpoint I usually get the client into a state
where recovery deadlocks.  The server informs the client of a
cb_path_down sequence error, the client then does a
bind_connection_to_session and checks the status of the lease.

I found that bind_connection_to_session sets the NFS4_SESSION_DRAINING
flag on the client, but this flag is never unset before
nfs4_check_lease() reaches nfs4_proc_sequence().  This causes the client
to deadlock, halting all NFS activity to the server.  nfs4_proc_sequence()
is only called by the state manager, so I can change it to run in privileged
mode to bypass the NFS4_SESSION_DRAINING check and avoid the deadlock.
