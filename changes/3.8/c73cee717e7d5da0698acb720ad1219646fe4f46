USB: EHCI: remove ehci_port_power() routine

This patch (as1623) removes the ehci_port_power() routine and all the
places that call it.  There's no reason for ehci-hcd to change the
port power settings; the hub driver takes care of all that stuff.

There is one exception: When the controller is resumed from
hibernation or following a loss of power, the ports that are supposed
to be handed over to a companion controller must be powered on first.
Otherwise the handover won't work.  This process is not visible to the
hub driver, so it has to be handled in ehci-hcd.
