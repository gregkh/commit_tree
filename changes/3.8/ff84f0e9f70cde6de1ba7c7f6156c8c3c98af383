Revert "usb: otg: mxs-phy: Fix mx23 operation"

The real reason causes mx23 fail are:

- Calling mxs_phy_hw_init(mxs_phy) again at connection
- Error connect/disconnect nodity at hub.c

The coming patch will fix above two problems, Mike Thompson
tested his hardware works OK after commented out this delay
setting.

This reverts commit 363366cf61c544ea476f3d220f43a95cb03014f5.
