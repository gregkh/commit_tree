ARM: zynq: Allow UART1 to be used as DEBUG_LL console.

The main UART on the Xilinx ZC702 board is UART1, located at address
e0001000.  Add a Kconfig option to select this device as the low-level
debugging port.  This allows the really early boot printouts to reach
the USB serial adaptor on this board.

For consistency's sake, add a choice entry for UART0 even though it is
the the default if UART1 is not selected.
