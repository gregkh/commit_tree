target: Add/check max_write_same_len device attribute + update block limits VPD

This patch adds a new max_write_same_len device attribute for use with
WRITE_SAME w/ UNMAP=0 backend emulation.  This can be useful for
lowering the default backend value (IBLOCK uses 0xFFFF).

Also, update block limits VPD emulation code in spc_emulate_evpd_b0() to
report MAXIMUM WRITE SAME LENGTH, and enforce max_write_same_len during
sbc_parse() -> sbc_setup_write_same() CDB sanity checking for all emulated
WRITE_SAME w/ UNMAP=0 cases.

(Robert: Move max_write_same_len check in sbc_setup_write_same() to
         check both WRITE_SAME w/ UNMAP=1 and w/ UNMAP=0 cases)
