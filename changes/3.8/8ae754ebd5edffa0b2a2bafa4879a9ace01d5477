mfd: ab8500-core: Remove unused ab8500-gpio IRQ ranges

The IRQ ranges provided in ab8500-core to be passed on to the
ab8500-gpio driver are not only redundant, but they are also
causing a warning in the boot log. These IRQ ranges, like any
other MFD related IRQ resource are passed though MFD core for
automatic conversion to virtual IRQs; however, MFD core does
not support IRQ mapping of IRQ ranges. Let's just remove them.
