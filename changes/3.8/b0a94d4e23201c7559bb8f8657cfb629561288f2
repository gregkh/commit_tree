KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Emulate PURR, SPURR and DSCR registers

This adds basic emulation of the PURR and SPURR registers.  We assume
we are emulating a single-threaded core, so these advance at the same
rate as the timebase.  A Linux kernel running on a POWER7 expects to
be able to access these registers and is not prepared to handle a
program interrupt on accessing them.

This also adds a very minimal emulation of the DSCR (data stream
control register).  Writes are ignored and reads return zero.
