wireless: gelic: make use of WLAN_EID_VENDOR_SPECIFIC

The include file linux/ieee80211.h contains three definitions for
the same thing in enum ieee80211_eid due to historic changes:

    /* Information Element IDs */
    enum ieee80211_eid {
        :
        WLAN_EID_WPA = 221,
        WLAN_EID_GENERIC = 221,
        WLAN_EID_VENDOR_SPECIFIC = 221,
        :
    };

The standard refers to this as "vendor specific" element so the
other two definitions are better not used. This patch changes the
wireless drivers to use one definition, ie. WLAN_EID_VENDOR_SPECIFIC.
