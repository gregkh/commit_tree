aoe: "payload" sysfs file exports per-AoE-command data transfer size

The userland aoetools package includes an "aoe-stat" command that can
display a "payload size" column when the aoe driver exports this
information.  Users can quickly see what amount of user data is
transferred inside each AoE command on the network, network headers
excluded.
