pinctrl: add function to retrieve range from pin

This adds a function to the pinctrl core to retrieve the GPIO
range associated with a certain pin for a certain controller.
This is needed when a pinctrl driver want to look up the
corresponding struct gpio_chip for a certain pin. As the
GPIO drivers can now create these ranges themselves, the
pinctrl driver no longer knows about all its associated GPIO
chips.
