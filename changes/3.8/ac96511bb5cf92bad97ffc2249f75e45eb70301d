usb: phy: change phy notify connect/disconnect API

The old parameter "port" is useless for phy notify, as one usb
phy is only for one usb port. New parameter "speed" stands for
the device's speed which is on the port, this "speed" parameter
is needed at some platforms which will do some phy operations
according to device's speed.
