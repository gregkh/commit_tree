nfsd: get rid of cl_recdir field

Remove the cl_recdir field from the nfs4_client struct. Instead, just
compute it on the fly when and if it's needed, which is now only when
the legacy client tracking code is in effect.

The error handling in the legacy client tracker is also changed to
handle the case where md5 is unavailable. In that case, we'll warn
the admin with a KERN_ERR message and disable the client tracking.
