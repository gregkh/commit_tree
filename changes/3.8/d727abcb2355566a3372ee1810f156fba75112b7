netns: Deduplicate and fix copy_net_ns when !CONFIG_NET_NS

The copy of copy_net_ns used when the network stack is not
built is broken as it does not return -EINVAL when attempting
to create a new network namespace.  We don't even have
a previous network namespace.

Since we need a copy of copy_net_ns in net/net_namespace.h that is
available when the networking stack is not built at all move the
correct version of copy_net_ns from net_namespace.c into net_namespace.h
Leaving us with just 2 versions of copy_net_ns.  One version for when
we compile in network namespace suport and another stub for all other
occasions.
