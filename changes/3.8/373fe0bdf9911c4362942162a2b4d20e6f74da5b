ARM: OMAP: Add function to request a timer by capability

Currently OMAP timers can be requested by requesting any available or by a
numerical device ID. If a specific timer is required because it has a particular
capability, such as can interrupt the on-chip DSP in addition to the ARM CPU,
then the user needs to know the device ID of the timer with this feature.
Therefore, add a new API called omap_dm_timer_request_by_cap() that allows
drivers to request a timer by capability.
