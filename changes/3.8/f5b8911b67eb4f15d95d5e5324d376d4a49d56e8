xfs: remove xfs_tosspages

It's a buggy, unnecessary wrapper that is duplicating
truncate_pagecache_range().

When replacing the call in xfs_change_file_space(), also ensure that
the length being allocated/freed is always positive before making
any changes. These checks are done in the lower extent manipulation
functions, too, but we need to do them before any page cache
operations.
