libceph: don't use rb_init_node() in ceph_osdc_alloc_request()

The red-black node in the ceph osd request structure is initialized
in ceph_osdc_alloc_request() using rbd_init_node().  We do need to
initialize this, because in __unregister_request() we call
RB_EMPTY_NODE(), which expects the node it's checking to have
been initialized.  But rb_init_node() is apparently overkill, and
may in fact be on its way out.  So use RB_CLEAR_NODE() instead.

For a little more background, see this commit:
    4c199a93 rbtree: empty nodes have no color"
