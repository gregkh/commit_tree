ASoC: Ux500: Initialise PCM from MSP probe rather than as a device

The PCM is a pseudo-device. It doesn't have any of it's own registers
or hardware. It rather acts as a layer of abstraction for DMA
transfers. Hence, instead of classifying it as a device in its own
right, we call the initialisation from the MSP driver.
