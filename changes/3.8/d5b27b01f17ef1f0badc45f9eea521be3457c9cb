drbd: move the drbd_work_queue from drbd_socket to drbd_connection

cherry-picked and adapted from drbd 9 devel branch
In 8.4, we don't distinguish between "resource work" and "connection
work" yet, we have one worker for both, as we still have only one connection.

We only ever used the "data.work",
no need to keep the "meta.work" around.

Move tconn->data.work to tconn->sender_work.
