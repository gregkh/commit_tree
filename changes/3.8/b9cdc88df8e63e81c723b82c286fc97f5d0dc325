virtio: 9p: correctly pass physical address to userspace for high pages

When using a virtio transport, the 9p net device may pass the physical
address of a kernel buffer to userspace via a scatterlist inside a
virtqueue. If the kernel buffer is mapped outside of the linear mapping
(e.g. highmem), then virt_to_page will return a bogus value and we will
populate the scatterlist with junk.

This patch uses kmap_to_page when populating the page array for a kernel
buffer.
