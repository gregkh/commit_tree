staging: comedi: dyna_pci10xx: remove PCI_VENDOR_ID_DYNALOG

The PCI chip used on this board is from PLX Technologies Inc. As stated
in the comments of this driver, Dynalog does not have a registered PCI
vendor id so this board uses the PLX vendor id. The kernel provides an
id for that vendor in pci_ids.h (PCI_VENDOR_ID_PLX). Use it instead of
creating a duplicate with a different name.
