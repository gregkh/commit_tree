netprio_cgroup: allow nesting and inherit config on cgroup creation

Inherit netprio configuration from ->css_online(), allow nesting and
remove .broken_hierarchy marking.  This makes netprio_cgroup's
behavior match netcls_cgroup's.

Note that this patch changes userland-visible behavior.  Nesting is
allowed and the first level cgroups below the root cgroup behave
differently - they inherit priorities from the root cgroup on creation
instead of starting with 0.  This is unfortunate but not doing so is
much crazier.
