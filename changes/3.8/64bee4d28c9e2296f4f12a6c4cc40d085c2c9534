spi / ACPI: add ACPI enumeration support

ACPI 5 introduced SPISerialBus resource that allows us to enumerate and
configure the SPI slave devices behind the SPI controller. This patch adds
support for this to the SPI core.

In addition we bind ACPI nodes to SPI devices. This makes it possible for
the slave drivers to get the ACPI handle for further configuration.
