regmap: make lock/unlock functions customizable

It is sometimes convenient for a regmap user to override the standard
regmap lock/unlock functions with custom functions.
For instance this can be useful in case an already existing spinlock
or mutex has to be used for locking a set of registers instead of the
internal regmap spinlock/mutex.
Note that the fast_io field of struct regmap_bus is ignored in case
custom locking functions are used.
