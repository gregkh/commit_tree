MIPS: tlbex: Fix section mismatches

The new functions introduced in commit 02a5417751 (MIPS: tlbex: Deal with
re-definition of label) should be marked __cpuinit, to eliminate a
warning that can pop up when CONFIG_EXPORT_UASM is disabled:

      LD      arch/mips/mm/built-in.o
    WARNING: arch/mips/mm/built-in.o(.text+0x2a4c): Section mismatch in reference from the function uasm_bgezl_hazard() to the function .cpuinit.text:uasm_il_bgezl()
    The function uasm_bgezl_hazard() references
    the function __cpuinit uasm_il_bgezl().
    This is often because uasm_bgezl_hazard lacks a __cpuinit
    annotation or the annotation of uasm_il_bgezl is wrong.

    WARNING: arch/mips/mm/built-in.o(.text+0x2a68): Section mismatch in reference from the function uasm_bgezl_label() to the function .cpuinit.text:uasm_build_label()
    The function uasm_bgezl_label() references
    the function __cpuinit uasm_build_label().
    This is often because uasm_bgezl_label lacks a __cpuinit
    annotation or the annotation of uasm_build_label is wrong.

(This warning might not occur if the function was inlined.)
