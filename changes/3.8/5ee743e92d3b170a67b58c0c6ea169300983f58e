drbd: remove useless kobject_uevent from drbd_adm_connect

Calling kobject_uevent, which may sleep, from within rcu_read_lock()
protected regions is not possible.
This particular kobject_uevent also is also wrong. It was supposed to
trigger a udev run, just in case something relevant to udev symlink
magic has changed, when adjusting runtime re-configurable settings while
we still had the "syncer conf".  It was improperly placed in connect
when we dropped the "syncer conf".  The right thing to do is probably to
call "udevadm trigger" directly in those cases where drbdadm thinks
there was a need to trigger extra udev runs.
