target/iscsi_target: Add NodeACL tags for initiator group support

Thanks for reviews, looking a lot better.

---- 8< ----

Initiator access config could be easier. The way other storage vendors
have addressed this is to support initiator groups: the admin adds
initiator WWNs to the group, and then LUN permissions can be granted for
the entire group at once.

Instead of changing ktarget's configfs interface, this patch keeps
the configfs interface per-initiator-wwn and just adds a 'tag' field
for each. This should be enough for user tools like targetcli to group
initiator ACLs and sync their configurations.

acl_tag is not used internally, but needs to be kept in configfs so that
all user tools can avoid dependencies on each other.

Code tested to work, although userspace pieces still to be implemented.
