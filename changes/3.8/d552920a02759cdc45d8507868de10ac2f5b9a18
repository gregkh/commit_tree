ARM: tegra30: cpuidle: add powered-down state for CPU0

This is a power gating idle mode. It support power gating vdd_cpu rail
after all cpu cores in "powered-down" status. For Tegra30, the CPU0 can
enter this state only when all secondary CPU is offline. We need to take
care and make sure whole secondary CPUs were offline and checking the
CPU power gate status. After that, the CPU0 can go into "powered-down"
state safely. Then shut off the CPU rail.

Be aware of that, you may see the legacy power state "LP2" in the code
which is exactly the same meaning of "CPU power down".
