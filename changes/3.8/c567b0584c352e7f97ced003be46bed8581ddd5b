ARM: OMAP2+: omap_device: Correct resource handling for DT boot

When booting with DT the OF core can fill up the resources provided within
the DT blob.
The current way of handling the DT boot prevents us from removing hwmod data
for platforms only suppose to boot with DT (OMAP5 for example) since we need
to keep the whole hwmod database intact in order to have more resources in
hwmod than in DT (to be able to append the DMA resource from hwmod).

To fix this issue we just examine the OF provided resources:
If we do not have resources we use hwmod to fill them.
If we have resources we check if we already able to recive DMA resource, if
no we only append the DMA resurce from hwmod to the OF provided ones.

In this way we can start removing hwmod data for devices which have their
resources correctly configured in DT without regressions.
