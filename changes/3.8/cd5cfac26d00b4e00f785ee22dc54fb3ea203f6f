ARM: dts: AM33XX: Add tsl2550 ambient light sensor DT data

In AM335x EVM tsl2550 ambient light sensor is connected to I2C2 bus.
Add child node inside i2c2 node with i2c slave address.

TAOS tsl2550 sensor is using a two-wire SMBus serial interface.
Reduce I2C2 clock frequency to 100kHz from 400kHz because the
maximum clock frequency of SMBus is 100kHz.
