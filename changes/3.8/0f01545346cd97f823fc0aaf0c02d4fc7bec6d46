rtlwifi: rtl8192ce: rtl8192cu: rtl8192se: rtl81723ae: Turn on building of the new driver

This patch completes the addition of the new driver for the Realtek
RTL8723AE devices by adding the make file and by modifying Kconfig
and Makefile of rtlwifi. Some variable names were shortened to ease
the problem of limiting all lines to 80 characters, thus changes were
made to wifi.h and rtl8192{ce,cu,sw}/hw.c.
