virtio-mmio: Fix irq parsing in command line parameter

When the resource_size_t is 64-bit long, the sscanf() on
the virtio device command line paramter string may return
wrong value because its format was defined as "%u". Fixed
by using an intermediate local value of a known length.

Also added cleaned up the resource creation and added extra
comments to make the parameters parsing easier to follow.
