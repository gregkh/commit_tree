sched/rt: Use root_domain of rt_rq not current processor

When the system has multiple domains do_sched_rt_period_timer()
can run on any CPU and may iterate over all rt_rq in
cpu_online_mask.  This means when balance_runtime() is run for a
given rt_rq that rt_rq may be in a different rd than the current
processor.  Thus if we use smp_processor_id() to get rd in
do_balance_runtime() we may borrow runtime from a rt_rq that is
not part of our rd.

This changes do_balance_runtime to get the rd from the passed in
rt_rq ensuring that we borrow runtime only from the correct rd
for the given rt_rq.

This fixes a BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:687! in __disable_runtime
when we try reclaim runtime lent to other rt_rq but runtime has
been lent to a rt_rq in another rd.
