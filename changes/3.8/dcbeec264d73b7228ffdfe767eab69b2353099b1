sony-laptop: fix SNC buffer calls when SN06 returns Integers

SN06 in some cases returns an Integer instead of a buffer. While the
code handling the return value was trying to cope with the difference,
the memcpy call was not making any difference between the two types of
acpi_object union. This regression was introduced in 3.5.
While there also rework the return value logic to improve readability.
