block: remove deadlock in disk_clear_events

In disk_clear_events, do not put work on system_nrt_freezable_wq.
Instead, put it on system_nrt_wq.

There is a race between probing a usb and suspending the device.  Since
probing a usb calls disk_clear_events, which puts work on a frozen
workqueue, probing cannot finish after the workqueue is frozen.  However,
suspending cannot finish until the usb probe is finished, so we get a
deadlock, causing the system to reboot.

The way to reproduce this bug is to wake up from suspend with a usb
storage device plugged in, or plugging in a usb storage device right
before suspend.  The window of time is on the order of time it takes to
probe the usb device.  As long as the workqueues are frozen before the
call to add_disk within sd_probe_async finishes, there will be a deadlock
(which calls blkdev_get, sd_open, check_disk_change, then
disk_clear_events).  This is not difficult to reproduce after figuring out
the timings.
