PM / devfreq: map devfreq drivers to governor using name

Allow devfreq drivers to register a preferred governor name
and when the devfreq governor loads itself at a later point
required drivers are managed appropriately, at the time of
unload of a devfreq governor, stop managing those drivers
as well.

Since the governor structures do not need to be exposed
anymore, remove the definitions and make them static

NOTE: devfreq_list_lock is now used to protect governor
start and stop - as this allows us to protect governors and
devfreq with the proper dependencies as needed.

As part of this change, change the registration of exynos
bus driver to request for ondemand using the governor name.
