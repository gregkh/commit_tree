net: usbnet: fix tx_dropped statistics

It is normal for minidrivers accumulating frames to return NULL
from their tx_fixup function. We do not want to count this as a
drop, or log any debug messages.  A different exit path is
therefore chosen for such drivers, skipping the debug message
and the tx_dropped increment.

The test for accumulating drivers was however completely bogus,
making the exit path selection depend on whether the user had
enabled tx_err logging or not. This would arbitrarily mess up
accounting for both accumulating and non-accumulating minidrivers,
and would result in unwanted debug messages for the accumulating
drivers.

Fix by testing for FLAG_MULTI_PACKET instead, which probably was
the intention from the beginning.  This usage match the documented
behaviour of this flag:

 Indicates to usbnet, that USB driver accumulates multiple IP packets.
 Affects statistic (counters) and short packet handling.
