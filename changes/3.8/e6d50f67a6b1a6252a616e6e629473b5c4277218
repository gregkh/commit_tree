libceph: always reset osds when kicking

When ceph_osdc_handle_map() is called to process a new osd map,
kick_requests() is called to ensure all affected requests are
updated if necessary to reflect changes in the osd map.  This
happens in two cases:  whenever an incremental map update is
processed; and when a full map update (or the last one if there is
more than one) gets processed.

In the former case, the kick_requests() call is followed immediately
by a call to reset_changed_osds() to ensure any connections to osds
affected by the map change are reset.  But for full map updates
this isn't done.

Both cases should be doing this osd reset.

Rather than duplicating the reset_changed_osds() call, move it into
the end of kick_requests().
