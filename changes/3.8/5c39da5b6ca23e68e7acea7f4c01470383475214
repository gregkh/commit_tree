Btrfs: do not delete a subvolume which is in a R/O subvolume

Step to reproduce:
 # mkfs.btrfs <disk>
 # mount <disk> <mnt>
 # btrfs sub create <mnt>/subv0
 # btrfs sub snap <mnt> <mnt>/subv0/snap0
 # change <mnt>/subv0 from R/W to R/O
 # btrfs sub del <mnt>/subv0/snap0

We deleted the snapshot successfully. I think we should not be able to delete
the snapshot since the parent subvolume is R/O.
