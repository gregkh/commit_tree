Staging: silicom: Fix up version.h includes

drivers/staging/silicom/bypasslib/bplibk.h actually uses stuff from
version.h so it should include the header.
drivers/staging/silicom/bp_proc.c and
drivers/staging/silicom/bypasslib/bypass.c currently include the
header but use nothing from it so they don't need to.
