Btrfs: changes to live filesystem are also written to replacement disk

During a running dev replace operation, all write requests to
the live filesystem are duplicated to also write to the target
drive. Therefore btrfs_map_block() is changed to duplicate
stripes that are written to the source disk of a device replace
procedure to be written to the target disk as well.
