mm/slob: Drop usage of page->private for storing page-sized allocations

This field was being used to store size allocation so it could be
retrieved by ksize(). However, it is a bad practice to not mark a page
as a slab page and then use fields for special purposes.
There is no need to store the allocated size and
ksize() can simply return PAGE_SIZE << compound_order(page).
