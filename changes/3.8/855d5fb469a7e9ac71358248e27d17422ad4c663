staging: comedi: amplc_dio200: enable enhanced features of PCIe boards

The new PCIe boards PCIe215, PCIe236 and PCIe296 have some enhanced
features (over the older boards), although none of these features are
supported by this driver yet.

Enable the enhanced features in hardware and use `dio200_layouts[]` to
indicate which boards support the enhanced features.
