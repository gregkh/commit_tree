x86/kernel: remove tboot 1:1 page table creation code

For TXT boot, while Linux kernel trys to shutdown/S3/S4/reboot, it
need to jump back to tboot code and do TXT teardown work. Previously
kernel zapped all mem page identity mapping (va=pa) after booting, so
tboot code mem address was mapped again with identity mapping. Now
kernel didn't zap the identity mapping page table, so tboot related
code can remove the remapping code before trapping back now.
