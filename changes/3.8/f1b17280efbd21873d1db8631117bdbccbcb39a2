sched: Maintain runnable averages across throttled periods

With bandwidth control tracked entities may cease execution according to user
specified bandwidth limits.  Charging this time as either throttled or blocked
however, is incorrect and would falsely skew in either direction.

What we actually want is for any throttled periods to be "invisible" to
load-tracking as they are removed from the system for that interval and
contribute normally otherwise.

Do this by moderating the progression of time to omit any periods in which the
entity belonged to a throttled hierarchy.
