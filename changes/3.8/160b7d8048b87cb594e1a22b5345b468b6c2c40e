Thermal: Remove the cooling_cpufreq_list.

Problem of using this list is that the cpufreq_get_max_state callback will be
called when register cooling device by thermal_cooling_device_register, but
this list isn't ready at this moment. What's more, there is no need to maintain
such a list, we can get cpufreq_cooling_device instance by the private
thermal_cooling_device.devdata.
