drm/i915: Align the retire_requests worker to the nearest second

By using round_jiffies() we can align the wakeup of our worker to the
nearest second in order to batch wakeups and reduce system load, which
is useful for unimportant coarse tasks like our retire_requests.

v2: round_jiffies_relative() already returns the relative timeout value,
so no need to incorrectly perform the subtraction twice. The timer
interface still leaves the possibility for the value of jiffies to
change be we program the timer.
