drbd: disambiguation, s/P_DISCARD_WRITE/P_SUPERSEDED/

To avoid confusion with REQ_DISCARD aka TRIM, rename our
"discard concurrent write acks" from P_DISCARD_WRITE to P_SUPERSEDED.

At the same time, rename the drbd request event DISCARD_WRITE
to CONFLICT_RESOLVED. It already triggers both successful completion
or restart of the request, depending on our RQ_POSTPONED flag.
