mac80211: adapt slot time in IBSS mode

In 5GHz/802.11a, we are allowed to use short slot times. Doing this
may increases performance by 20% for legacy connections (54 MBit/s).
I can confirm this in my tests (27% more throughput using iperf), and
also have a small positive effect (5% more throughput) for HT rates,
tested on 1 stream.
