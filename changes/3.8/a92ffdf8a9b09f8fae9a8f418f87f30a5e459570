rbd: allow null image name

Format 2 parent images are partially identified by their image id,
but it may not be possible to determine their image name.  The name
is not strictly needed for correct operation, so we won't be
treating it as an error if we don't know it.  Handle this case
gracefully in rbd_name_show().
