tracing: Separate open function from set_event and available_events

The open function used by available_events is the same as set_event even
though it uses different seq functions. This causes a side effect of
writing into available_events clearing all events, even though
available_events is suppose to be read only.

There's no reason to keep a single function for just the open and have
both use different functions for everything else. It is a little
confusing and causes strange behavior. Just have each have their own
function.
