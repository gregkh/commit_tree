Revert "sh-sci / PM: Use power.irq_safe"

This reverts commit 5a50a01bf0 (sh-sci / PM: Use power.irq_safe, from
Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>, 2011-08-24).

In order to get console PM work properly, we should implement uart_ops
->pm() operation, rather than sprinkle band-ading runtime PM calls in
the driver.
