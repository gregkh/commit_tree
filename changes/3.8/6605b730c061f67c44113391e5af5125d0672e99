FEC: Add time stamping code and a PTP hardware clock

This patch adds a driver for the FEC(MX6) that offers time
stamping and a PTP haderware clock. Because FEC\ENET(MX6)
hardware frequency adjustment is complex, we have implemented
this in software by changing the multiplication factor of the
timecounter.
