perf tools: Don't stop synthesizing threads when one vanishes

The perf_event__synthesize_threads routine synthesizes all the existing
threads in the system, because we don't have any kernel facilities to
ask for PERF_RECORD_{FORK,MMAP,COMM} for existing threads.

It was returning an error as soon as one thread couldn't be synthesized,
which is a bit extreme when, for instance, a forkish workload is
running, like a kernel compile.
