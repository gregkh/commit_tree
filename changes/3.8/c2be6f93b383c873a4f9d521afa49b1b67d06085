PCI: pciehp: Use per-slot workqueues to avoid deadlock

When we have a hotplug-capable PCIe port with a second hotplug-capable
PCIe port below it, removing the device below the upstream port causes
a deadlock.

The deadlock happens because we use the pciehp_wq workqueue to run
pciehp_power_thread(), which uses pciehp_disable_slot() to remove devices
below the upstream port.  When we remove the downstream PCIe port, we call
pciehp_remove(), the pciehp driver's .remove() method.  That calls
flush_workqueue(pciehp_wq), which deadlocks because the
pciehp_power_thread() work item is still running.

This patch avoids the deadlock by creating a workqueue for every PCIe port
and removing the single shared workqueue.

Here's the call path that leads to the deadlock:

  pciehp_queue_pushbutton_work
    queue_work(pciehp_wq)                   # queue pciehp_power_thread
    ...

  pciehp_power_thread
    pciehp_disable_slot
      remove_board
	pciehp_unconfigure_device
	  pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device
	    ...
	      pciehp_remove                 # pciehp driver .remove method
		pciehp_release_ctrl
		  pcie_cleanup_slot
		    flush_workqueue(pciehp_wq)

This is fairly urgent because it can be caused by simply unplugging a
Thunderbolt adapter, as reported by Daniel below.
