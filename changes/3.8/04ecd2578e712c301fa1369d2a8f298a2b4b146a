mac80211: track needed RX chains for channel contexts

On each channel that the device is operating on, it
may need to listen using one or more chains depending
on the SMPS settings of the interfaces using it. The
previous channel context changes completely removed
this ability (before, it was available as the SMPS
mode).

Add per-context tracking of the required static and
dynamic RX chains and notify the driver on changes.
To achieve this, track the chains and SMPS mode used
on each virtual interface and update the channel
context whenever this changes.
