i2c: omap: Fix the revision register read

The revision register on OMAP4 is a 16-bit lo and a 16-bit
hi. Currently the driver reads only the lower 8-bits.
Fix the same by preventing the truncating of the rev register
for OMAP4.

Also use the scheme bit ie bit-14 of the hi register to know if it
is OMAP_I2C_IP_VERSION_2.

On platforms previous to OMAP4 the offset 0x04 is IE register whose
bit-14 reset value is 0, the code uses the same to its advantage.

Also since the omap_i2c_read_reg uses reg_map_ip_* a raw_readw is done
to fetch the revision register.

The dev->regs is populated after reading the rev_hi. A NULL check
has been added in the resume handler to prevent the access before
the setting of the regs.
