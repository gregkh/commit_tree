arm64: elf: fix core dumping to match what glibc expects

The kernel's internal definition of ELF_NGREG uses struct pt_regs, which
means that we disagree with userspace on the size of coredumps since
glibc correctly uses the user-visible struct user_pt_regs.

This patch fixes our ELF_NGREG definition to use struct user_pt_regs
and introduces our own ELF_CORE_COPY_REGS to convert between the user
and kernel structure definitions.
