drivers/virt: the Freescale hypervisor driver doesn't need to check MSR[GS]

The MSR[GS] bit indicates whether the kernel is running in processor guest
state mode, but such a check is unnecessary.  The driver already checks
for the /hypervisor node and the fsl,hv-version property, so it already
knows that it's running under the Freescale hypervisor.

There is nothing in the driver that inherently requires guest state,
anyway.

This fixes a break that can occur in some randconfig builds.
