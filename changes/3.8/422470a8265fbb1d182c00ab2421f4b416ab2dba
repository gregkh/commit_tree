pwm: vt8500: Ensure PWM clock is enabled during pwm_config

This patch corrects a bug reported by Peter Vasil.

When all PWMs are disabled, PWM module may be disabled during
calls to pwm_config. This patch enables/disables the clock in
pwm_config to ensure the module is active before register read/
writes.
