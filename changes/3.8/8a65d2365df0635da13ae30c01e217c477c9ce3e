ARM: EXYNOS: Bind devices to power domains using DT

This patch adds a way to specify bindings between devices and power
domains using device tree.

A device can be bound to particular power domain by adding a
power-domain property containing a phandle to the domain. The device
will be bound to the domain before binding a driver to it and unbound
after unbinding a driver from it.
