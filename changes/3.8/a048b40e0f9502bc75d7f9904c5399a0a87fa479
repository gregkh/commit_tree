ixgbe: Add support for IPv6 and UDP to ixgbe_get_headlen

This change adds support for IPv6 and UDP to ixgbe_get_headlen. The
advantage to this is that we can now handle ipv4/UDP, ipv6/TCP, and
ipv6/UDP with a single memcpy instead of having to do them in multiple
pskb_may_pull calls.

A quick bit of testing shows that we increase throughput for a single
session of netperf from 8800Mpbs to about 9300Mpbs in the case of ipv6/TCP.
As such overall ipv6 performance should improve with this change.
