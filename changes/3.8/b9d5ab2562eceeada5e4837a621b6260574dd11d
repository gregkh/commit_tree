slub, hotplug: ignore unrelated node's hot-adding and hot-removing

SLUB only focuses on the nodes which have normal memory and it ignores the
other node's hot-adding and hot-removing.

Aka: if some memory of a node which has no onlined memory is online, but
this new memory onlined is not normal memory (for example, highmem), we
should not allocate kmem_cache_node for SLUB.

And if the last normal memory is offlined, but the node still has memory,
we should remove kmem_cache_node for that node.  (The current code delays
it when all of the memory is offlined)

So we only do something when marg->status_change_nid_normal > 0.
marg->status_change_nid is not suitable here.

The same problem doesn't exist in SLAB, because SLAB allocates kmem_list3
for every node even the node don't have normal memory, SLAB tolerates
kmem_list3 on alien nodes.  SLUB only focuses on the nodes which have
normal memory, it don't tolerate alien kmem_cache_node.  The patch makes
SLUB become self-compatible and avoids WARNs and BUGs in rare conditions.
