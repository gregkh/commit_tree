cpuidle: prepare the cpuidle core to handle multiple drivers

This patch is a preparation for the multiple cpuidle drivers support.

As the next patch will introduce the multiple drivers with the Kconfig
option and we want to keep the code clean and understandable, this patch
defines a set of functions for encapsulating some common parts and splits
what should be done under a lock from the rest.
