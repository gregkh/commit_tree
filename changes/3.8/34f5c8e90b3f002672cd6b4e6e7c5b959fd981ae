Btrfs: in scrub repair code, simplify alloc error handling

In the scrub repair code, the code is changed to handle memory
allocation errors a little bit smarter. The change is to handle
it just like a read error. This simplifies the code and removes
a couple of lines of code, since the code to handle read errors
is there anyway.
