ath9k: remove sc->rx.rxbuflock to fix a deadlock

The commit "ath9k: fix rx flush handling" added a deadlock that happens
because ath_rx_tasklet is called in a section that has already taken the
rx buffer lock.

It seems that the only purpose of the rxbuflock was a band-aid fix to the
reset vs rx tasklet race, which has been properly fixed in the commit
"ath9k: add a better fix for the rx tasklet vs rx flush race".

Now that the fix is in, we can safely remove the lock to avoid such issues.
