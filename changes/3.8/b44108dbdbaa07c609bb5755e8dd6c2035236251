ipv4: Fix route refcount on pmtu discovery

git commit 9cb3a50c (ipv4: Invalidate the socket cached route on
pmtu events if possible) introduced a refcount problem. We don't
get a refcount on the route if we get it from__sk_dst_get(), but
we need one if we want to reuse this route because __sk_dst_set()
releases the refcount of the old route. This patch adds proper
refcount handling for that case. We introduce a 'new' flag to
indicate that we are going to use a new route and we release the
old route only if we replace it by a new one.
