pidns: Consolidate initialzation of special init task state

Instead of setting child_reaper and SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE one way
for the system init process, and another way for pid namespace
init processes test pid->nr == 1 and use the same code for both.

For the global init this results in SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE being set
much earlier in the initialization process.

This is a small cleanup and it paves the way for allowing unshare and
enter of the pid namespace as that path like our global init also will
not set CLONE_NEWPID.
