drivers/video: add support for the Solomon SSD1307 OLED Controller

Add support for the Solomon SSD1307 OLED controller found on the
Crystalfontz CFA10036 board.

This controller can drive a display with a resolution up to 128x39 and can
operate over I2C or SPI.

The current driver has only been tested on the CFA-10036, that is using
this controller over I2C to driver a 96x16 OLED screen.
