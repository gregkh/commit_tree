be2net: fix be_close() to ensure all events are ack'ed

In be_close(), be_eq_clean() must be called after all RX/TX/MCC queues
have been cleaned to ensure that any events caused while cleaning up
completions are notified/acked. Not clearing all events can cause
upredictable behaviour when RX rings are re-created in the subsequent
be_open().
