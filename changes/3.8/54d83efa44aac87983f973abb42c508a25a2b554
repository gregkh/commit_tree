ipvs: fix build errors related to config option combinations

Fix two build error introduced by commit 63dca2c0:
 "ipvs: Fix faulty IPv6 extension header handling in IPVS"

First build error was fairly trivial and can occur, when
CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6 is disabled.

The second build error was tricky, and can occur when deselecting
both all Netfilter and IPVS, but selecting CONFIG_IPV6.  This is
caused by "kernel/sysctl_binary.c" including "net/ip_vs.h", which
includes "linux/netfilter_ipv6/ip6_tables.h" causing include
of "include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h" which then cannot find
the typedef nf_hookfn.

Fix this by only including "linux/netfilter_ipv6/ip6_tables.h" in
case of CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6 as its already used to guard the usage
of ipv6_find_hdr().
