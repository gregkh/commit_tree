PCI: shpchp: Handle push button event asynchronously

Use non-ordered workqueue for attention button events.

Attention button events on each slot can be handled asynchronously. So
we should use non-ordered workqueue. This patch also removes ordered
workqueue in shpchp as a result.

486b10b9f4 ("PCI: pciehp: Handle push button event asynchronously") made
the same change to pciehp.  I split this out from a patch by Yijing Wang
<wangyijing@huawei.com> so we fix one thing at a time and to make the
shpchp history correspond more closely with the pciehp history.
