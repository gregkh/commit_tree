virtio_console: Merge struct buffer_token into struct port_buffer

Refactoring the splice functionality by unifying the approach for
sending scatter-lists and regular buffers. This simplifies
buffer handling and reduces code size. Splice will now allocate
a port_buffer and send_buf() and free_buf() can always be used
for any buffer.
