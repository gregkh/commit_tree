rbd: increase maximum snapshot name length

Change RBD_MAX_SNAP_NAME_LEN to be based on NAME_MAX.  That is a
practical limit for the length of a snapshot name (based on the
presence of a directory using the name under /sys/bus/rbd to
represent the snapshot).

The /sys entry is created by prefixing it with "snap_"; define that
prefix symbolically, and take its length into account in defining
the snapshot name length limit.

Enforce the limit in rbd_add_parse_args().  Also delete a dout()
call in that function that was not meant to be committed.
