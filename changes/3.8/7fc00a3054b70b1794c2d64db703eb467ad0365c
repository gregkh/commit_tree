ath9k: add a better fix for the rx tasklet vs rx flush race

Ensure that the rx tasklet is no longer running when entering the reset path.
Also remove the distinction between flush and no-flush frame processing.
If a frame has been received and ACKed by the hardware, the stack needs to see
it, so that the BA receive window does not go out of sync.
