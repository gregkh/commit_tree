xfs: verify superblocks as they are read from disk

Add a superblock verify callback function and pass it into the
buffer read functions. Remove the now redundant verification code
that is currently in use.

Adding verification shows that secondary superblocks never have
their "sb_inprogress" flag cleared by mkfs.xfs, so when validating
the secondary superblocks during a grow operation we have to avoid
checking this field. Even if we fix mkfs, we will still have to
ignore this field for verification purposes unless a version of mkfs
that does not have this bug was used.
