mmc: dt: add no-1-8-v device tree flag

The OLPC XO-1.75 laptop includes a SDHCI controller which is 1.8v
capable, and it truthfully reports so in its capabilities. This
alternate voltage is used for driving new "UHS-I" SD cards at their
full speed.

However, what the controller doesn't know is that the motherboard
physically doesn't have a 1.8v supply available, so attempting to
switch to the 1.8v level will result in a situation that cannot be
recovered from without physically replugging the SD card.

Add a device tree flag that can be used on systems like these,
and hook it up to the equivalent SDHCI quirk.
