s390/mm,vmemmap: use 1MB frames for vmemmap

Use 1MB frames for vmemmap if EDAT1 is available in order to
reduce TLB pressure
Always use a 1MB frame even if its only partially needed for
struct pages. Otherwise we would end up with a mix of large
frame and page mappings, because vmemmap_populate gets called
for each section (256MB -> 3.5MB memmap) separately.
Worst case is that we would waste 512KB.
