KVM: PPC: bookehv: Allow duplicate calls of DO_KVM macro

The current form of DO_KVM macro restricts its use to one call per input
parameter set. This is caused by kvmppc_resume_\intno\()_\srr1 symbol
definition.
Duplicate calls of DO_KVM are required by distinct implementations of
exeption handlers which are delegated at runtime. Use a rare label number
to avoid conflicts with the calling contexts.
