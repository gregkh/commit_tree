rcu: Document alternative RCU/reference-count algorithms

The approach for mixing RCU and reference counting listed in the RCU
documentation only describes one possible approach.  This approach can
result in failure on the read side, which is nice if you want fresh data,
but not so good if you want simple code.  This commit therefore adds
two additional approaches that feature unconditional reference-count
acquisition by RCU readers.  These approaches are very similar to that
used in the security code.
