vm selftests: print failure status instead of cause make error

Original behavior:
  bash-4.1$ make -C vm run_tests
  make: Entering directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/vm'
  /bin/sh ./run_vmtests
  ./run_vmtests: line 24: /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages: Permission denied
  Please run this test as root
  make: *** [run_tests] Error 1
  make: Leaving directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/vm'

After applying the patch:
  bash-4.1$ make -C vm run_tests
  make: Entering directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/vm'
  ./run_vmtests: line 24: /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages: Permission denied
  Please run this test as root
  vmtests: [FAIL]
  make: Leaving directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/vm'
