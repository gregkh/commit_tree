mac80211: Notify new IBSS network creation

Initialization of beacon transmission in IBSS mode depends
on whether a new BSS is being created or joined. When joining
an existing IBSS network, beaconing has to start only after
a TSF-sync has happened - this is explained in 11.1.4.

Introduce a new parameter in the BSS information structure to
indicate creator/joiner mode.
