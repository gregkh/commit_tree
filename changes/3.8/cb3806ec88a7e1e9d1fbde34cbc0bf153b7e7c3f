Btrfs: fix race in check-integrity caused by usage of bitfield

The structure member mirror_num is modified concurrently to the
structure member is_iodone. This doesn't require any locking by
design, unless everything is stored in the same 32 bits of a
bit field. This was the case and xfstest 284 was able to
trigger false warnings from the checker code. This patch
seperates the bits and fixes the race.
