cuse: do not register multiple devices with identical names

Sysfs doesn't allow two devices with the same name, but we register a
sysfs entry for each cuse device without checking for name collisions.
This extends the registration to first check whether the name was already
registered.

To avoid race-conditions between the name-check and linking the device, we
need to protect the whole registration with a mutex.
