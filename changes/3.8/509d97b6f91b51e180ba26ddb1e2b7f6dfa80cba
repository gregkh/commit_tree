s390/chsc: fix SEI usage

cbc0dd1 "s390/pci: CHSC PCI support for error and availability events"
introduced a new SEI notification type as part of pci support.
The way SEI was called with nt2 and nt0 consecutive broke the nt0
stuff used for channel subsystem notifications.

The reason why this was broken with the mentioned patch is that you
cannot selectively disable type 0 notifications (so even when asked
for type 2 only, type 0 could be presented).

The way to do it is to tell SEI which types of notification you can
process and -this is the important part- look at the SEI result which
notification type you actually received.
