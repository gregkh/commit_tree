rbd: remove linger unconditionally

In __unregister_linger_request(), the request is being removed
from the osd client's req_linger list only when the request
has a non-null osd pointer.  It should be done whether or not
the request currently has an osd.

This is most likely a non-issue because I believe the request
will always have an osd when this function is called.
