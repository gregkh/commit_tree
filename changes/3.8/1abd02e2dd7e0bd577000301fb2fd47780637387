drm/i915: don't rewrite the GTT on resume v4

The BIOS shouldn't be touching this memory across suspend/resume, so
just leave it alone.  This saves us ~6ms on resume on my T420 (retested
with write combined PTEs).

v2: change gtt restore default on pre-gen4 (Chris)
    move needs_gtt_restore flag into dev_priv
v3: make sure we restore GTT on resume from hibernate (Daniel)
    use opregion support as the cutoff for restore from resume (Chris)
v4: use a better check for opregion (Chris)

OpRegion. Also explain in a comment what's going on.]
