mtd: sh_flctl: Minor cleanups

Some small fixes to avoid sparse and smatch complain. Other cosmetic fixes
as well.

- Change of the type of the member index in struct sh_flctl from signed
to unsigned. We use index by addressing array members, so unsigned is more
concise here. Adapt functions relying on sh_flctl::index.
- Remove a blurring cast in write_fiforeg().
- Apply consistent naming scheme when refering to the data buffer.
- Shorten some unnecessarily verbose functions.
- Remove spaces at start of lines.
