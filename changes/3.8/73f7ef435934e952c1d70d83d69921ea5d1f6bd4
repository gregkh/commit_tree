sysctl: Pass useful parameters to sysctl permissions

- Current is implicitly avaiable so passing current->nsproxy isn't useful.
- The ctl_table_header is needed to find how the sysctl table is connected
  to the rest of sysctl.
- ctl_table_root is avaiable in the ctl_table_header so no need to it.

With these changes it becomes possible to write a version of
net_sysctl_permission that takes into account the network namespace of
the sysctl table, an important feature in extending the user namespace.
