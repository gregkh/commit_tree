PM / devfreq: exynos4_bus: honor RCU lock usage

OPP pointers cannot be expected to be valid beyond the boundary
of rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock. Unfortunately, the current
exynos4 busfreq driver does not honor the usage constraint and stores
the OPP pointer in struct busfreq_data. This could potentially
become invalid later such as: across devfreq opp change decisions,
resulting in unpredictable behavior.

To fix this, we introduce a busfreq specific busfreq_opp_info
structure which is used to handle OPP information. OPP information
is de-referenced to voltage and frequency pairs as needed into
busfreq_opp_info structure and used as needed.
