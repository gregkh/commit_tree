mm/sl[au]b: Move slabinfo processing to slab_common.c

This patch moves all the common machinery to slabinfo processing
to slab_common.c. We can do better by noticing that the output is
heavily common, and having the allocators to just provide finished
information about this. But after this first step, this can be done
easier.
