xtensa: add device trees support

Device trees allow specification of hardware topology and device
parameters at runtime instead of hard-coding them in platform setup
code. This allows running single binary kernel on a range of compatible
boards.

New boot parameters tag BP_TAG_FDT is allocated and a pointer to flat
device tree is passed in it.

Note that current interrupt mapping scheme uses single cell for
interrupt identification. That means that IRQ numbers used in DTS must
be CPU internal IRQ numbers, not external. It is possible to extend
interrupt identification to two cells, and use second cell to tell
external IRQ numbers form internal. That would allow to use single DTS
on multiple boards with different mapping of external IRQ numbers.
