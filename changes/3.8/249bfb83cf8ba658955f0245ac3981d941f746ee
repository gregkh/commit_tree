PCI/PM: Clean up PME state when removing a device

Devices are added to pci_pme_list when drivers use pci_enable_wake()
or pci_wake_from_d3(), but they aren't removed from the list unless
the driver explicitly disables wakeup.  Many drivers never disable
wakeup, so their devices remain on the list even after they are
removed, e.g., via hotplug.  A subsequent PME poll will oops when
it tries to touch the device.

This patch disables PME# on a device before removing it, which removes
the device from pci_pme_list.  This is safe even if the device never
had PME# enabled.

This oops can be triggered by unplugging a Thunderbolt ethernet adapter
on a Macbook Pro, as reported by Daniel below.
