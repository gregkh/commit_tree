ixgbe: (PTP) refactor init, cyclecounter and reset

This patch modifies when and where PTP registers and data are set. Previously
a work-around was used inside cyclecounter_start in order to reset some of the
time registers. This patch creates a new ixgbe_ptp_reset specifically for this
purpose. The cyclecounter configuration has trimmed down to only modify what
is necessary. Due to hardware conditions after probe and before open, PTP init
has now moved into the ixgbe_open call. This allows the ptp device name in the
sysfs to be the ethernet device name instead of the MAC address.

The cyclecounter check flag is renamed to PTP_ENABLED and is used to prevent
PTP init from happening when PTP has not been enabled.
