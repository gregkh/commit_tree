brcmfmac: change mac address parameter in brcmf_add_if()

The function brcmf_add_if() is called with mac address set to NULL
for the primary interface. When handling IF ADD events the firmware
provides a address mask in the event to derive its mac address from
the primary mac address. Rename the parameter and use it as a mask.
