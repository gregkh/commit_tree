staging: et131x: Remove unnecessary NULL pointer assignments

During a previous refactoring excerise, two NULL pointer assingments
were moved to their respective pointer declarations. Dan Carpenter
correctly points out that these assignments are not needed.
Removing them.

Also two small whitespace changes - rejoining split lines, as they are
now less than 80 chars.
