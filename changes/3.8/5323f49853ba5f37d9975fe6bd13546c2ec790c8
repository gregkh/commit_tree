spi: Fix comparison of different integer types

Fix problem discovered with sparse:
+ drivers/spi/spi.c:1554:37: sparse: incompatible types in comparison expression (different signedness)
drivers/spi/spi.c: In function 'spi_write_then_read':
drivers/spi/spi.c:1554:23: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast [enabled by default]

The change to SPI_BUFSIZ was introduced in commit b3a223ee2, "spi:
Remove SPI_BUFSIZ restriction on spi_write_then_read()"
