target: pass sense_reason as a return value

Pass the sense reason as an explicit return value from the I/O submission
path instead of storing it in struct se_cmd and using negative return
values.  This cleans up a lot of the code pathes, and with the sparse
annotations for the new sense_reason_t type allows for much better
error checking.

(nab: Convert spc_emulate_modesense + spc_emulate_modeselect to use
      sense_reason_t with Roland's MODE SELECT changes)
