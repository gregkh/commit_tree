Btrfs: recheck bio against block device when we map the bio

Alex reported a problem where we were writing between chunks on a rbd
device.  The thing is we do bio_add_page using logical offsets, but the
physical offset may be different.  So when we map the bio now check to see
if the bio is still ok with the physical offset, and if it is not split the
bio up and redo the bio_add_page with the physical sector.  This fixes the
problem for Alex and doesn't affect performance in the normal case.  Thanks,
