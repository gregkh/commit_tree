dma-debug: New interfaces to debug dma mapping errors

Add dma-debug interface debug_dma_mapping_error() to debug
drivers that fail to check dma mapping errors on addresses
returned by dma_map_single() and dma_map_page() interfaces.
This interface clears a flag set by debug_dma_map_page() to
indicate that dma_mapping_error() has been called by the
driver. When driver does unmap, debug_dma_unmap() checks the
flag and if this flag is still set, prints warning message
that includes call trace that leads up to the unmap. This
interface can be called from dma_mapping_error() routines to
enable dma mapping error check debugging.

Tested: Intel iommu and swiotlb (iommu=soft) on x86-64 with
        CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG enabled and disabled.
