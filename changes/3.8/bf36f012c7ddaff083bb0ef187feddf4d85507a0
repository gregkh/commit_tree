staging: comedi: addi-data: remove addi_amcc_s5933.h

Now that the PCI bus walking has been removed from the addi-data
drivers, the only differenced between addi_amcc_s9533.h and the
standard comedi amcc_s5933.h is the additional defines for the
apci3120 "ADDON RELATED ADDITIONS". Move those defines to
hwdrv_apci3120.c.

Modify all the addi-data drivers to then include the standard
comedi amcc_s5933.h header and delete the duplicate in addi-data.
