exofs: clean up the correct page collection on write error

if ore_write() fails, we would unlock the pages of pcol, which is now
empty, rather than pcol_copy which owns the pages when ore_write() is
called. this means that no pages will actually be unlocked
(pcol.nr_pages == 0) and the writing process (more accurately, the
syncing process) will hang waiting for a writeback notification that
never comes.

moreover, if ore_write() fails, pcol_free() is called for pcol, whereas
pcol_copy is the object owning the ore_io_state, thus leaking the
ore_io_state.

I have simplified Idan's original patch a bit, everything else still
holds
