MN10300: Get rid of unused variable from ASB2305 PCI code

Get rid of an unused variable in pcibios_fixup_device_resources() which leads
to the following warning:

arch/mn10300/unit-asb2305/pci.c: In function 'pcibios_fixup_device_resources':
arch/mn10300/unit-asb2305/pci.c:324:24: warning: unused variable 'region' [-Wunused-variable]

Whilst we're at it, merge the two integer variable declarations into one line.
