add Marvell 88W8688 support to libertas_sdio

This chip is for example used in the GuruPlug.
This patch avoids the following error:
libertas_sdio: failed to load firmware
libertas_sdio: probe of mmc0:0001:1 failed with error -5

The fix is based on code in:
drivers/net/wireless/libertas_uap/uap_sdio_mmc.c

connection on the GuruPlug:
