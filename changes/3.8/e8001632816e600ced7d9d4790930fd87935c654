serial: mxs-auart: add the DMA support for mx28

Only we meet the following conditions, we can enable the DMA support for
auart:

  (1) We enable the DMA support in the dts file, such as
      arch/arm/boot/dts/imx28.dtsi.

  (2) We enable the hardware flow control.

  (3) We use the mx28, not the mx23. Due to hardware bug(see errata: 2836),
      we can not add the DMA support to mx23.
