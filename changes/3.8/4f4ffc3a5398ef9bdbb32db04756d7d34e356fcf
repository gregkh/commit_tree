unbreak automounter support on 64-bit kernel with 32-bit userspace (v2)

automount-support is broken on the parisc architecture, because the existing
#if list does not include a check for defined(__hppa__). The HPPA (parisc)
architecture is similiar to other 64bit Linux targets where we have to define
autofs_wqt_t (which is passed back and forth to user space) as int type which
has a size of 32bit across 32 and 64bit kernels.

During the discussion on the mailing list, H. Peter Anvin suggested to invert
the #if list since only specific platforms (specifically those who do not have
a 32bit userspace, like IA64 and Alpha) should have autofs_wqt_t as unsigned
long type.

This suggestion is probably the best way to go, since Arm64 (and maybe others?)
seems to have a non-working automounter. So in the long run even for other new
upcoming architectures this inverted check seem to be the best solution, since
it will not require them to change this #if again (unless they are 64bit only).
