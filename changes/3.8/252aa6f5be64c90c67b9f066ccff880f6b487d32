mm: redefine address_space.assoc_mapping

Overhaul struct address_space.assoc_mapping renaming it to
address_space.private_data and its type is redefined to void*.  By this
approach we consistently name the .private_* elements from struct
address_space as well as allow extended usage for address_space
association with other data structures through ->private_data.

Also, all users of old ->assoc_mapping element are converted to reflect
its new name and type change (->private_data).
