ath9k: fix double-free bug on beacon generate failure

When the next beacon is sent, the ath_buf from the previous run is reused.
If getting a new beacon from mac80211 fails, bf->bf_mpdu is not reset, yet
the skb is freed, leading to a double-free on the next beacon tx attempt,
resulting in a system crash.
