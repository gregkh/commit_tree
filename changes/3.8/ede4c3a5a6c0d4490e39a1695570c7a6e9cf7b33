[media] gscpa: get rid of warning: suggest braces around empty body

There are hundreds of messages like this one, when GSPCA debug is
disabled, when compiled with W=1:
drivers/media/usb/gspca/spca500.c:725:46: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement [-Wempty-body]
Get rid of it, especially as it might actually cause troubles on
some places.
