ACPI: Add ACPI CPU hot-remove support

Added support of CPU hot-remove via an ACPI eject notification.
It calls acpi_bus_hot_remove_device(), which shares the same code
path with the sysfs eject operation.  acpi_os_hotplug_execute()
runs the hot-remove operation in kacpi_hotplug_wq and serializes
it between ACPI hot-remove and sysfs eject requests.
