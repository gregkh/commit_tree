cpuidle: remove the power_specified field in the driver

We realized that the power usage field is never filled and when it
is filled for tegra, the power_specified flag is not set causing all
of these values to be reset when the driver is initialized with
set_power_state().

However, the power_specified flag can be simply removed under the
assumption that the states are always backward sorted, which is the
case with the current code.

This change allows the menu governor select function and the
cpuidle_play_dead() to be simplified.  Moreover, the
set_power_states() function can removed as it does not make sense
any more.

Drop the power_specified flag from struct cpuidle_driver and make
the related changes as described above.

As a consequence, this also fixes the bug where on the dynamic
C-states system, the power fields are not initialized.
