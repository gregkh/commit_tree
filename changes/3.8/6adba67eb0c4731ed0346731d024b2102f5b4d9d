ARM: OMAP2+: am33xx-hwmod: Fix wrongly terminated am33xx_usbss_mpu_irqs array

The IRQ array must be terminated by -1 and not by -1+OMAP_INTC_START
This led to having a resource list of 100s of IRQs.

Looks like this was caused by commit a2cfc509 (ARM: OMAP3+: hwmod: Add
AM33XX HWMOD data) that probably had some search and replace updates
done for the patch for sparse irq support.
