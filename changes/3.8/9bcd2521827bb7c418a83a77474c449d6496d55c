drbd: fix "stalled" empty resync

With sync-after dependencies, given "lucky" timing of pause/unpause
events, and the end of an empty (0 bits set) resync was sometimes not
detected on the SyncTarget, leading to a "stalled" SyncSource state.

Fixed this by expecting not only "Inconsistent -> UpToDate" but also
"Consistent -> UpToDate" transitions for the peer disk state
to end a resync.
