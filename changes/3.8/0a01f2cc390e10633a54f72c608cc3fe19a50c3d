pidns: Make the pidns proc mount/umount logic obvious.

Track the number of pids in the proc hash table.  When the number of
pids goes to 0 schedule work to unmount the kernel mount of proc.

Move the mount of proc into alloc_pid when we allocate the pid for
init.

Remove the surprising calls of pid_ns_release proc in fork and
proc_flush_task.  Those code paths really shouldn't know about proc
namespace implementation details and people have demonstrated several
times that finding and understanding those code paths is difficult and
non-obvious.

Because of the call path detach pid is alwasy called with the
rtnl_lock held free_pid is not allowed to sleep, so the work to
unmounting proc is moved to a work queue.  This has the side benefit
of not blocking the entire world waiting for the unnecessary
rcu_barrier in deactivate_locked_super.

In the process of making the code clear and obvious this fixes a bug
reported by Gao feng <gaofeng@cn.fujitsu.com> where we would leak a
mount of proc during clone(CLONE_NEWPID|CLONE_NEWNET) if copy_pid_ns
succeeded and copy_net_ns failed.
