aoe: initialize sysminor to avoid compiler warning

Because the minor_get and related functions use the return values for
errors, the compiler doesn't know that sysminor will always either 1) be
initialized in aoedev_by_aoeaddr by the call to minor_get, or 2) be
unused as the "goto out" is executed.

This patch avoids the compiler warning.
