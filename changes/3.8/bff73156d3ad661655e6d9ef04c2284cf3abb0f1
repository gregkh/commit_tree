PCI: Provide method to reduce the number of total VFs supported

Some implementations of SRIOV provide a capability structure
value of TotalVFs that is greater than what the software can support.
Provide a method to reduce the capability structure reported value
to the value the driver can support.
This ensures sysfs reports the current capability of the system,
hardware and software.
Example for its use: igb & ixgbe -- report 8 & 64 as TotalVFs,
but drivers only support 7 & 63 maximum.
