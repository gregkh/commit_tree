drm/i915: fix false positive "Unclaimed write" messages

We don't check if the "unclaimed register" bit is set before we call
writel, so if it was already set before, we might print a misleading
message about "unclaimed write" on the wrong register.

This patch makes us check the unclaimed bit before the writel, so we
can print a new "Unknown unclaimed register before writing to %x"
message.
