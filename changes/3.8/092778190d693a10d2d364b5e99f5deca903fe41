ARM: ux500: Supply the STMPE keypad Device Tree node to the STUIB DT

This patch allows the STMPE keypad driver to be successfully probed
and initialised during a Device Tree enabled boot sequence. It
contains all of the required properties needed to setup and map
each key on the 6x3 keypad located on the ST User Interface Board.
