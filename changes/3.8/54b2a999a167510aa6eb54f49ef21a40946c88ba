pwm: lpc32xx: Properly disable the clock on device removal

A single clock is used for all PWMs meaning the clock's reference count
might be between 0 and N when .remove() is called. Instead of a single
clk_disable() call pwm_disable() on each PWM, to ensure that
clk_disable() is called for each PWM that is still enabled.
