m68knommu: merge ColdFire 5249 and 525x definitions

The ColdFire 5249 and 525x family of SoCs are very similar. Most of the
internals are the same, and are mapped the same. We can use a single set of
peripheral definitions for all of them.

So merge the current m5249sim.h and m525xsim.h definitions into a single
file. The 5249 is now obsolete, and the 525x parts are current, so I have
chosen to move everything into the existing m525xsim.h file.
