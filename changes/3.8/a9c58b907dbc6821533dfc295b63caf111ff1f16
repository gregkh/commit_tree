mm, oom: change type of oom_score_adj to short

The maximum oom_score_adj is 1000 and the minimum oom_score_adj is -1000,
so this range can be represented by the signed short type with no
functional change.  The extra space this frees up in struct signal_struct
will be used for per-thread oom kill flags in the next patch.
