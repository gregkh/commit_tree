drm/i915: Create generic intel_panel for LVDS and eDP

Create a generic struct intel_panel for sharing a data structure and code
between eDP and LVDS panels. Add the new struct to intel_connector so that
later on we can have generic EDID and mode reading functions with EDID
caching that transparently fallback to fixed mode when EDID is not
available.

Add intel_panel as a dummy first, and move data (such as the mentioned
fixed mode) to it in later patches.
