net: cdc_ncm: splitting rx_fixup for code reuse

Verifying and handling received MBIM and NCM frames will need
to be different in three areas:
 - verifying the NDP signature
 - checking valid datagram length
 - datagram header manipulation

This makes it inconvenient to share rx_fixup in whole.  But
some verification parts are common.  Split these out in separate
functions.
