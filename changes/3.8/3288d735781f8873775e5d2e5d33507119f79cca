ixgbe: eliminate Smatch warnings in ixgbe_debugfs.c

This patch replaces calls to copy_to_user, copy_from_user, and the associated
logic, with calls to simple_read_from_buffer and simple_write_to_buffer
respectively.  This was done to eliminate warnings generated by the Smatch
static analysis tool.
