KVM: PPC: BookE: Support FPU on non-hv systems

When running on HV aware hosts, we can not trap when the guest sets the FP
bit, so we just let it do so when it wants to, because it has full access to
MSR.

For non-HV aware hosts with an FPU (like 440), we need to also adjust the
shadow MSR though. Otherwise the guest gets an FP unavailable trap even when
it really enabled the FP bit in MSR.
