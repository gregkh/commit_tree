ARM: OMAP2+: Don't use __omap_dm_timer_reset()

Currently OMAP2+ devices are using the function __omap_dm_timer_reset() to
configure the clock-activity, idle, wakeup-enable and auto-idle fields in the
timer OCP_CFG register. The name of the function is mis-leading because this
function does not actually perform a reset of the timer.

For OMAP2+ devices, HWMOD is responsible for reseting and configuring the
timer OCP_CFG register. Therefore, do not use __omap_dm_timer_reset() for
OMAP2+ devices and rely on HWMOD. Furthermore, some timer instances do not
have the fields clock-activity, wakeup-enable and auto-idle and so this
function could configure the OCP_CFG register incorrectly.

Currently HWMOD is not configuring the clock-activity field in the OCP_CFG
register for timers that have this field. Commit 0f0d080 (ARM: OMAP: DMTimer:
Use posted mode) configures the clock-activity field to keep the f-clk enabled
so that the wake-up capability is enabled. Therefore, add the appropriate flags
to the timer HWMOD structures to configure this field in the same way.

For OMAP2/3 devices all dmtimers have the clock-activity field, where as for
OMAP4 devices, only dmtimer 1, 2 and 10 have the clock-activity field.

Verified on OMAP2420 H4, OMAP3430 Beagle and OMAP4430 Panda that HWMOD is
configuring the dmtimer OCP_CFG register as expected for clock-events timer.
