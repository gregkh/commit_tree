cgroup: make CSS_* flags bit masks instead of bit positions

Currently, CSS_* flags are defined as bit positions and manipulated
using atomic bitops.  There's no reason to use atomic bitops for them
and bit positions are clunkier to deal with than bit masks.  Make
CSS_* bit masks instead and use the usual C bitwise operators to
access them.
