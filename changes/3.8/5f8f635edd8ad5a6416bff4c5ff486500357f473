drm/radeon: avoid deadlock in pm path when waiting for fence

radeon_fence_wait_empty_locked should not trigger GPU reset as no
place where it's call from would benefit from such thing and it
actually lead to a kernel deadlock in case the reset is triggered
from pm codepath. Instead force ring completion in place where it
makes sense or return early in others.
