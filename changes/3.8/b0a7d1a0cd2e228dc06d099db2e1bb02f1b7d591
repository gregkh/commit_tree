perf machine: Carve up event processing specific from perf_tool

The perf_tool vtable expects methods that receive perf_tool and
perf_sample entries, but for tools not interested in doing any special
processing on non PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE events, like 'perf top', and for
those not using perf_session, like 'perf trace', they were using
perf_event__process passing tool and sample paramenters that were just
not used.

Provide 'machine' methods for this purpose and make the perf_event
ones use them.
