ARM: 7600/1: include CONFIG_DEBUG_LL_INCLUDE rather than mach/debug-macro.S

Commit 91a9fec (ARM: move debug macros to common location) moves
arch/arm/kernel/debug.S and arch/arm/kernel/head.S to
CONFIG_DEBUG_LL_INCLUDE, but leaves arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S
still with mach/debug-macro.S.  This causes the following build error
on platforms that moved to new DEBUG_LL inclusion mechanism, when
arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S is compiled with DEBUG turned on.

  AS      arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.o
arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S:49:30: fatal error: mach/debug-macro.S: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Fix the problem by replacing mach/debug-macro.S inclusion with
CONFIG_DEBUG_LL_INCLUDE one.
