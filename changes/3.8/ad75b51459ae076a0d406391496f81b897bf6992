ARM: 7579/1: arch/allow a scno of -1 to not cause a SIGILL

On tracehook-friendly platforms, a system call number of -1 falls
through without running much code or taking much action.

ARM is different. This adds a short-circuit check in the trace path to
avoid any additional work, as suggested by Russell King, to make sure
that ARM behaves the same way as other platforms.
