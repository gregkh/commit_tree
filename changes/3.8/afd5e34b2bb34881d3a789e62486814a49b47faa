[SCSI] sd: Reshuffle init_sd to avoid crash

scsi_register_driver will register a prep_fn() function, which
in turn migh need to use the sd_cdp_pool for DIF.
Which hasn't been initialised at this point, leading to
a crash. So reshuffle the init_sd() and exit_sd() paths
to have the driver registered last.
