svcrpc: Revert "sunrpc/cache.h: replace simple_strtoul"

Commit bbf43dc888833ac0539e437dbaeb28bfd4fbab9f "sunrpc/cache.h: replace
simple_strtoul" introduced new range-checking which could cause get_int
to fail on unsigned integers too large to be represented as an int.

We could parse them as unsigned instead--but it turns out svcgssd is
actually passing down "-1" in some cases.  Which is perhaps stupid, but
there's nothing we can do about it now.

So just revert back to the previous "sloppy" behavior that accepts
either representation.
