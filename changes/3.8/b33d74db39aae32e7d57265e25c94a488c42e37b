USB: fix fsl_otg config dependency

USB_GADGET_FSL_USB2 has been changed to USB_FSL_USB2 by commit
193ab2a6070039e7ee2b9b9bebea754a7c52fd1b (usb: gadget: allow
multiple gadgets to be built). But old USB_GADGET_FSL_USB2 is
still listed as dependency for fsl_otg driver, so the driver
cannot be selected in the configuration currently. Fix it.
