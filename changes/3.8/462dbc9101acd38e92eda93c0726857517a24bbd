pkt_sched: QFQ Plus: fair-queueing service at DRR cost

This patch turns QFQ into QFQ+, a variant of QFQ that provides the
following two benefits: 1) QFQ+ is faster than QFQ, 2) differently
from QFQ, QFQ+ correctly schedules also non-leaves classes in a
hierarchical setting. A detailed description of QFQ+, plus a
performance comparison with DRR and QFQ, can be found in [1].
