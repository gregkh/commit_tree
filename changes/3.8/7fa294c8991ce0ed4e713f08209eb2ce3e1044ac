userns: Allow chown and setgid preservation

- Allow chown if CAP_CHOWN is present in the current user namespace
  and the uid of the inode maps into the current user namespace, and
  the destination uid or gid maps into the current user namespace.

- Allow perserving setgid when changing an inode if CAP_FSETID is
  present in the current user namespace and the owner of the file has
  a mapping into the current user namespace.
