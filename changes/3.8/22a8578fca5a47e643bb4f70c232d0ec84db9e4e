mtd: mtd_blkdevs: Replace request handler kthread with a workqueue

By replacing a kthread with a workqueue, the code is now a bit clearer.
There's also a slight reduction of code size (numbers apply for x86):
Before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   3248	     36	      0	   3284	    cd4	drivers/mtd/mtd_blkdevs.o

After:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   3150	     36	      0	   3186	    c72	drivers/mtd/mtd_blkdevs.o

Due to lack of real hardware, tests have been performed on an emulated
environment with mtdswap and mtdblock over nandsim devices.
Some real testing should be done, before merging this patch.
