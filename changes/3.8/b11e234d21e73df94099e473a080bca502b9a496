Btrfs: do not mark ems as prealloc if we are writing to them

We are going to use EM's to log extents in the future, so we need to not
mark them as prealloc if they aren't actually prealloc extents.  Instead
mark them with FILLING so we know to ammend mod_start/mod_len and that way
we don't confuse the extent logging code.  Thanks,
