netfilter: xt_CT: fix crash while destroy ct templates

In (d871bef netfilter: ctnetlink: dump entries from the dying and
unconfirmed lists), we assume that all conntrack objects are
inserted in any of the existing lists. However, template conntrack
objects were not. This results in hitting BUG_ON in the
destroy_conntrack path while removing a rule that uses the CT target.

This patch fixes the situation by adding the template lists, which
is where template conntrack objects reside now.
