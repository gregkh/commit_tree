block: Avoid scheduling delayed work on a dead queue

Running a queue must continue after it has been marked dying until
it has been marked dead. So the function blk_run_queue_async() must
not schedule delayed work after blk_cleanup_queue() has marked a queue
dead. Hence add a test for that queue state in blk_run_queue_async()
and make sure that queue_unplugged() invokes that function with the
queue lock held. This avoids that the queue state can change after
it has been tested and before mod_delayed_work() is invoked. Drop
the queue dying test in queue_unplugged() since it is now
superfluous: __blk_run_queue() already tests whether or not the
queue is dead.
