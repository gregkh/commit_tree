staging:iio:ad7298: Do not perform endianness conversion in buffered mode

For buffered mode we do not want to perform endianness conversion in the kernel,
but rather offload it to user space, since it is not always required to do a
conversion at all. It also greatly simplifies the kernel code since no
post-processing has to be done and may allow future optimizations like streaming
data directly to a storage device or over the network via DMA.
