ext4: make ext4_init_dot_dotdot for inline dir usage

Currently, the initialization of dot and dotdot are encapsulated in
ext4_mkdir and also bond with dir_block. So create a new function
named ext4_init_new_dir and the initialization is moved to
ext4_init_dot_dotdot. Now it will called either in the normal non-inline
case(rec_len of ".." will cover the whole block) or when we converting an
inline dir to a block(rec len of ".." will be the real length). The start
of the next entry is also returned for inline dir usage.
