dm raid1: dont use map_context

Don't use map_info any more in dm-raid1.

map_info was used for writes to hold the region number. For this purpose
we add a new field dm_bio_details to dm_raid1_bio_record.

map_info was used for reads to hold a pointer to dm_raid1_bio_record (if
the pointer was non-NULL, bio details were saved; if the pointer was
NULL, bio details were not saved). We use
dm_raid1_bio_record.details->bi_bdev for this purpose. If bi_bdev is
NULL, details were not saved, if bi_bdev is non-NULL, details were
saved.
