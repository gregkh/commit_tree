vhost-net: enable zerocopy tx by default

Zero copy TX has been around for a while now.
We seem to be down to eliminating theoretical bugs
and performance tuning at this point:
it's probably time to enable it by default so that
most users get the benefit.

Keep the flag around meanwhile so users can experiment
with disabling this if they experience regressions.
I expect that we will remove it in the future.
