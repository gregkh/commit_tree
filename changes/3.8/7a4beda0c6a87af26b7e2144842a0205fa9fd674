regulator: as3711: Fix the logic in as3711_sel_check

Below equation means the "voltage" is the "smallest" voltage within specific
range.

ret = DIV_ROUND_UP(min - bottom) / step;
voltage = ret * step + bottom;

If we do try 1 down when (voltage > max), new voltage is then less than min
voltage. Which means the new voltage is not in the requested voltage range.

This patch also includes below cleanups:
- Use DIV_ROUND_UP
- rename variable 'ret' to 'sel' for better readability because as3711_sel_check
  returns the selector.
