f2fs: revisit the f2fs_gc flow

I'd like to revisit the f2fs_gc flow and rewrite as follows.

1. In practical, the nGC parameter of f2fs_gc is meaningless. So, let's
  remove it.
2. Background GC marks victim blocks as dirty one at a time.
3. Foreground GC should do cleaning job until acquiring enough free
  sections. Afterwards, it needs to do checkpoint.
