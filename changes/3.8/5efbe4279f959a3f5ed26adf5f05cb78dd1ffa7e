PM / QoS: Introduce request and constraint data types for PM QoS flags

Introduce struct pm_qos_flags_request and struct pm_qos_flags
representing PM QoS flags request type and PM QoS flags constraint
type, respectively.  With these definitions the data structures
will be arranged so that the list member of a struct pm_qos_flags
object will contain the head of a list of struct pm_qos_flags_request
objects representing all of the "flags" requests present for the
given device.  Then, the effective_flags member of a struct
pm_qos_flags object will contain the bitwise OR of the flags members
of all the struct pm_qos_flags_request objects in the list.

Additionally, introduce helper function pm_qos_update_flags()
allowing the caller to manage the list of struct pm_qos_flags_request
pointed to by the list member of struct pm_qos_flags.

The flags are of type s32 so that the request's "value" field
is always of the same type regardless of what kind of request it
is (latency requests already have value fields of type s32).
