userns: Implement unshare of the user namespace

- Add CLONE_THREAD to the unshare flags if CLONE_NEWUSER is selected
  As changing user namespaces is only valid if all there is only
  a single thread.
- Restore the code to add CLONE_VM if CLONE_THREAD is selected and
  the code to addCLONE_SIGHAND if CLONE_VM is selected.
  Making the constraints in the code clear.
