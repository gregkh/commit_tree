net: smc91x: use io{read, write}*_rep accessors instead of string functions

The {read,write}s{b,w,l} operations are not defined by all architectures
and are being removed from the asm-generic/io.h interface.

This patch replaces the usage of these string functions in the default
SMC accessors with io{read,write}{8,16,32}_rep calls instead, which are
defined for all architectures.
