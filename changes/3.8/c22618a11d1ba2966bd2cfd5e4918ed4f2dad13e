drivers/of: Constify device_node->name and ->path_component_name

Neither of these should ever be changed once set. Make them const and
fix up the users that try to modify it in-place. In one case
kmalloc+memcpy is replaced with kstrdup() to avoid modifying the string.

Build tested with defconfigs on ARM, PowerPC, Sparc, MIPS, x86 among
others.
