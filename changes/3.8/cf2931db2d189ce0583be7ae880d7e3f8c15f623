xfs: Bring some sanity to log unmounting

When unmounting the filesystem, there are lots of operations that
need to be done in a specific order, and they are spread across
across a couple of functions. We have to drain the AIL before we
write the unmount record, and we have to shut down the background
log work before we do either of them.

But this is all split haphazardly across xfs_unmountfs() and
xfs_log_unmount(). Move all the AIL flushing and log manipulations
to xfs_log_unmount() so that the responisbilities of each function
is clear and the operations they perform obvious.
