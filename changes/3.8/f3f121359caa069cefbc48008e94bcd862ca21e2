ipv6: tcp: clean up tcp_v6_early_demux() icsk variable

Remove an icsk variable, which by convention should refer to an
inet_connection_sock rather than an inet_sock. In the process, make
the tcp_v6_early_demux() code and formatting a bit more like
tcp_v4_early_demux(), to ease comparisons and maintenance.
