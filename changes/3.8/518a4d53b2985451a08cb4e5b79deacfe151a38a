drbd: don't try to clear bits once the disk has failed

If the disk has failed already, there is no point trying to change the
bitmap. drbd_set_out_of_sync() already had this safeguard,
time to add it to drbd_set_in_sync() as well.

This also prevents some warning messages, like
 FIXME asender in bm_change_bits_to, bitmap locked for 'detach' by worker
if our disk fails during resync, while there are some resync acks queued up.
