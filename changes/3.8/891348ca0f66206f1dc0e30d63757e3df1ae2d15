SGI-XP: handle non-fatal traps

We found a user code which was raising a divide-by-zero trap.  That trap
would lead to XPC connections between system-partitions being torn down
due to the die_chain notifier callouts it received.

This also revealed a different issue where multiple callers into
xpc_die_deactivate() would all attempt to do the disconnect in parallel
which would sometimes lock up but often overwhelm the console on very
large machines as each would print at least one line of output at the
end of the deactivate.

I reviewed all the users of the die_chain notifier and changed the code
to ignore the notifier callouts for reasons which will not actually lead
to a system to continue on to call die().
