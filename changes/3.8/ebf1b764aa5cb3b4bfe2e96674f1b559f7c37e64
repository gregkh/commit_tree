misc: hpilo: ignore auxiliary HP iLO BMC's

This patch ignores auxiliary HP Lights-Out (iLO) management controllers.

All HP iLO controllers that have had the PCI subsystem device ID set to 0x1979
by the BIOS are ignored. Also changes default number of channels to 16 and
bumps the version of the module from 1.3 to 1.4.
