rbd: zero return code in rbd_dev_image_id()

When rbd_dev_probe() calls rbd_dev_image_id() it expects to get
a 0 return code if successful, but it is getting a positive value.

The reason is that rbd_dev_image_id() returns the value it gets from
rbd_req_sync_exec(), which returns the number of bytes read in as a
result of the request.  (This ultimately comes from
ceph_copy_from_page_vector() in rbd_req_sync_op()).

Force the return value to 0 when successful in rbd_dev_image_id().
Do the same in rbd_dev_v2_object_prefix().
