drm/i915: add intel_dp_to_dev and intel_hdmi_to_dev

When we add struct intel_digital_port, there will be no direct way of
going from intel_{dp,hdmi} to drm_device: we will need to call
container_of().

This patch adds functions to go from intel_{dp,hdmi} to drm_device.
The main goal here is to greatly reduce the size of the next patch,
where we will change the implementation of the functions we just
added here (among other things).
