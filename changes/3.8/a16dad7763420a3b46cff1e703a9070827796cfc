MIPS: Fix potencial corruption

Normally r4k_dma_cache_inv should only ever be called with cacheline
aligned addresses.  If however, it isn't there is the theoretical
possibility of data corruption.  There is no correct way of handling this
and anyway, it should only happen if the DMA API is used incorrectly
so drop

There is a different corruption scenario with these CACHE instructions
removed but again there is no way of handling this correctly and it can
be triggered only through incorrect use of the DMA API.

So just get rid of the complexity.
