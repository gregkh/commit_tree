Thermal: Add ST-Ericsson DB8500 thermal driver.

This driver is based on the thermal management framework in thermal_sys.c. A
thermal zone device is created with the trip points to which cooling devices
can be bound, the current cooling device is cpufreq, e.g. CPU frequency is
clipped down to cool the CPU, and other cooling devices can be added and bound
to the trip points dynamically.  The platform specific PRCMU interrupts are
used to active thermal update when trip points are reached.
