sfc: Work-around flush timeout when flushes have completed

We sometimes hit a "failed to flush" timeout on some TX queues, but the
flushes have completed and the flush completion events seem to go missing.
In this case, we can check the TX_DESC_PTR_TBL register and drain the
queues if the flushes had finished.
