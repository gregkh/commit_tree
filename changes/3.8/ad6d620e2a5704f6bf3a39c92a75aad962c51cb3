Btrfs: allow repair code to include target disk when searching mirrors

Make the target disk of a running device replace operation
available for reading. This is only used as a last ressort for
the defect repair procedure. And it is dependent on the location
of the data block to read, because during an ongoing device
replace operation, the target drive is only partially filled
with the filesystem data.
