xhci: Fix conditional check in bandwidth calculation.

David reports that at drivers/usb/host/xhci.c:2257:

static bool xhci_is_sync_in_ep(unsigned int ep_type)
{
    return (ep_type == ISOC_IN_EP || ep_type != INT_IN_EP);
}

The static analyser cppcheck says

[linux-3.7-rc2/drivers/usb/host/xhci.c:2257]: (style) Redundant condition: If ep_type == 5, the comparison ep_type != 7 is always true.

Maybe the original programmer intention was something like

static bool xhci_is_sync_in_ep(unsigned int ep_type)
{
    return (ep_type == ISOC_IN_EP || ep_type == INT_IN_EP);
}

Fix this.

This patch should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.2, that
contain the commit 2b69899934c63b7b9432568584fb4c4a2924f40c "xhci: USB
3.0 BW checking."
