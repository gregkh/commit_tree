drm/i915: Disable AsyncFlip performance optimisations

This is a required workarounds for all products, especially on gen6+
where it causes the command streamer to fail to parse instructions
following a WAIT_FOR_EVENT. We use WAIT_FOR_EVENT for synchronising
between the GPU and the display engines, and so this bit being unset may
cause hangs.
