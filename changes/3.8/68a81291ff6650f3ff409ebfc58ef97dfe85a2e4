staging: Add SystemBase Multi-2/PCI driver

I ported the driver supplied by SystemBase to mainline.

As the driver had MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") it is declared as a GPL module
and thus I have the right to distribute it upstream. Note, I did the
bare minimum to get it working. It still needs a lot of loving.
