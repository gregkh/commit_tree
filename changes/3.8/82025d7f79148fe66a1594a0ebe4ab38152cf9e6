xfs: verify dir2 block format buffers

Add a dir2 block format read verifier. To fully verify every block
when read, call xfs_dir2_data_check() on them. Change
xfs_dir2_data_check() to do runtime checking, convert ASSERT()
checks to XFS_WANT_CORRUPTED_RETURN(), which will trigger an ASSERT
failure on debug kernels, but on production kernels will dump an
error to dmesg and return EFSCORRUPTED to the caller.
