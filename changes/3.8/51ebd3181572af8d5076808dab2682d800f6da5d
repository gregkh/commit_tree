ipv6: add support of equal cost multipath (ECMP)

Each nexthop is added like a single route in the routing table. All routes
that have the same metric/weight and destination but not the same gateway
are considering as ECMP routes. They are linked together, through a list called
rt6i_siblings.

ECMP routes can be added in one shot, with RTA_MULTIPATH attribute or one after
the other (in both case, the flag NLM_F_EXCL should not be set).

The patch is based on a previous work from
