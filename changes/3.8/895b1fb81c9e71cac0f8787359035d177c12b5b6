Staging: bcm: Clean up function CopyBufferToControlPacket in Misc.c

This patch cleans up the code in function
CopyBufferToControlPacket. Several things are
being done here: (1) remove the null
initialization from variable cntrl_buff, (2)
reverse the if statement to check if cntrl_buff
is null; if so, then write debug statement and
return -ENOMEM error code, and (3) indent the
code properly.
