ARM: pxa: remove pxa95x support

PXA95x isn't widely used. And it adds the effort on supporting
multiple platform. So remove it.

The assumption is that nobody will miss this support. If you are
reading this text because you actually require pxa95x support on
a new kernel, we can work out a way to revert this patch or add
support to the mmp platform.
