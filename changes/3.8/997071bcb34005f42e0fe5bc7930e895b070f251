mm: export a function to get vm committed memory

It will be useful to be able to access global memory commitment from
device drivers.  On the Hyper-V platform, the host has a policy engine to
balance the available physical memory amongst all competing virtual
machines hosted on a given node.  This policy engine is driven by a number
of metrics including the memory commitment reported by the guests.  The
balloon driver for Linux on Hyper-V will use this function to retrieve
guest memory commitment.  This function is also used in Xen self
ballooning code.
