drbd: dequeue single work items in wait_for_work()

As long as we still use drbd_queue_work_front(),
we must only dequeue the single first item during normal operation.

The comment in drbd_worker() even says so,
but bc8a5a1 drbd: remove struct drbd_tl_epoch objects (barrier works)
introduced the batch dequeueing again via list_splice_init() in
wait_for_work().

Change back to list_move() of the first item, if any.
