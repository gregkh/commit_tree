cifs: fix the format specifiers in sid_to_str

The format specifiers are for signed values, but these are unsigned.
Given that '-' is a delimiter between fields, I don't think you'd get
what you'd expect if you got a value here that would overflow the sign
bit.

The version and authority fields are 8 bit values so use a "hh" length
modifier there. The subauths are 32 bit values, so there's no need to
use a "l" length modifier there.
