aoe: support larger I/O requests via aoe_maxsectors module param

The GPFS filesystem is an example of an aoe user that requires the aoe
driver to support I/O request sizes larger than the default.  Most users
will not need large I/O request sizes, because they would need to be split
up into multiple AoE commands anyway.
