xfs: sync work is now only periodic log work

The only thing the periodic sync work does now is flush the AIL and
idle the log. These are really functions of the log code, so move
the work to xfs_log.c and rename it appropriately.

The only wart that this leaves behind is the xfssyncd_centisecs
sysctl, otherwise the xfssyncd is dead. Clean up any comments that
related to xfssyncd to reflect it's passing.
