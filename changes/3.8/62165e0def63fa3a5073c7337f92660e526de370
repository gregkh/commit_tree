drm/i915/lvds: Move some connector specific info across from the encoder

As there is 1:1 mapping between encoder and connector for the LVDS, the
goal is to simply reduce the amount of noise within the connector
functions, i.e. we split the encoder/connector for LVDS as best we can and
try to only operate on the LVDS connector from the connector funcs and the
LVDS encoder form the encoder funcs.
