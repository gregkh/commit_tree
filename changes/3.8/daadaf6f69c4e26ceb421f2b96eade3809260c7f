net: dm9000: use io{read,write}*_rep accessors

The {read,write}s{b,w,l} operations are not defined by all
architectures and are being removed from the asm-generic/io.h
interface.

This patch replaces the usage of these string functions in the default
DM9000 accessors with io{read,write}{8,16,32}_rep calls instead. This
is required as the dm9000 driver is in use by the blackfin
architecture which uses the asm-generic io accessors.
