CIFS: Fix write after setting a read lock for read oplock files

If we have a read oplock and set a read lock in it, we can't write to the
locked area - so, filemap_fdatawrite may fail with a no information for a
userspace application even if we request a write to non-locked area. Fix
this by writing directly to the server and then breaking oplock level from
level2 to None.

Also remove CONFIG_CIFS_SMB2 ifdefs because it's suitable for both CIFS
and SMB2 protocols.
