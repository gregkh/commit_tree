xfs: xfs_quiesce_attr() should quiesce the log like unmount

xfs_quiesce_attr() is supposed to leave the log empty with an
unmount record written. Right now it does not wait for the AIL to be
emptied before writing the unmount record, not does it wait for
metadata IO completion, either. Fix it to use the same method and
code as xfs_log_unmount().
