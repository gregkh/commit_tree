linux/audit.h: move ptrace.h include to kernel header

While the kernel internals want pt_regs (and so it includes
linux/ptrace.h), the user version of audit.h does not need it.  So move
the include out of the uapi version.

This avoids issues where people want the audit defines and userland
ptrace api.  Including both the kernel ptrace and the userland ptrace
headers can easily lead to failure.
