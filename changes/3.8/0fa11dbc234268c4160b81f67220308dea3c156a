charger-manager: Fix bug related to checking fully charged state of battery

This patch fix bug related to checking fully charged state of battery when
charger-manager call is_full_charged() function. After reading property of
charger/fuel-gauge through power_supply API, val.intval is more than 1.
So, is_full_charged() function always return true. If true, battery means
fully charged state.
