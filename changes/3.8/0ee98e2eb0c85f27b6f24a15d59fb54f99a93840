drbd: temporarily suspend io in drbd_adm_disk_opts

drbd_adm_disk_opts() does
	wait_event(mdev->al_wait, lc_try_lock(mdev->act_log));
	drbd_al_shrink(mdev);

If the device is very busy, this can take a very long time to succeed.
Fix this by temporarily suspending IO,
then quickly change the settings, and resume.
