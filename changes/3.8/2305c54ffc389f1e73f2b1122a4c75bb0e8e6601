smsc75xx: don't call usbnet_resume if usbnet_suspend fails

If usbnet_suspend returns an error we don't want to call
usbnet_resume to clean up, but instead just return the error.

If usbnet_suspend *does* succeed, and we have a problem further
on, the desired behaviour is still to call usbnet_resume
to clean up before returning.
