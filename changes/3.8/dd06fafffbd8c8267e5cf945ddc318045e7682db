ARM: ux500: Create a Device Tree for early HREFs

In ux500 platform code we currently support a number of devices.
Two of these devices are fairly similar, but have key differences.
Early (pre-v60) HREFs and the more up-to-date versions (v60+), and
they both need to be supported by Device Tree. Here we apply a DT
source file for the earlier versions.
