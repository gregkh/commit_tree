ipv6: unify logic evaluating inet6_dev's accept_ra property

As of 026359b [ipv6: Send ICMPv6 RSes only when RAs are accepted], the
logic determining whether to send Router Solicitations is identical
to the logic determining whether kernel accepts Router Advertisements.

However the condition itself is repeated in several code locations.

Unify it by introducing 'ipv6_accept_ra()' accessor.

Also, simplify the condition expression, making it more readable.
No semantic change.
