drbd: allow bitmap to change during writeout from resync_finished

Symptom: messages similar to
 "FIXME asender in bm_change_bits_to,
  bitmap locked for 'write from resync_finished' by worker"

If a resync or verify is finished (or aborted), a full bitmap writeout
is triggered.  If we have ongoing local IO, the bitmap may still change
during that writeout, pending and not yet processed acks may cause bits
to be cleared, while new writes may cause bits to be to be set.

To fix this, introduce the drbd_bm_write_copy_pages() variant.
