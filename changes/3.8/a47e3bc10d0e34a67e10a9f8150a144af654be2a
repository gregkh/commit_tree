ARM: 7612/1: imx: Do not select some errata that depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM

Since commit 62e4d357a (ARM: 7609/1: disable errata work-arounds which access
secure registers) ARM_ERRATA_743622/751472 depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.

Since imx has been converted to multiplatform, the following warning happens:

$ make imx_v6_v7_defconfig
warning: (SOC_IMX6Q && ARCH_TEGRA_2x_SOC && ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC) selects
ARM_ERRATA_751472 which has unmet direct dependencies (CPU_V7 &&
!ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM)
warning: (SOC_IMX6Q && ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC) selects ARM_ERRATA_743622
which has unmet direct dependencies (CPU_V7 && !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM)
warning: (SOC_IMX6Q && ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC) selects ARM_ERRATA_743622
which has unmet direct dependencies (CPU_V7 && !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM)
warning: (SOC_IMX6Q && ARCH_TEGRA_2x_SOC && ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC) selects
ARM_ERRATA_751472 which has unmet direct dependencies (CPU_V7 &&
!ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM)

Recommended approach is to remove ARM_ERRATA_743622/751472 from being selected
by SOC_IMX6Q and apply such workarounds into the bootloader.
