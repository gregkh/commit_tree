drbd: Fixed removal of volumes/devices from connected resources

When removing a volume/device we need to switch the connection
status of the peer back into WFReportParams.

  Before this fix it was left in Connected state. That means that
  the peer device continued to inform us about state changes, etc...
  But we deleted that minor -> protocol error.
