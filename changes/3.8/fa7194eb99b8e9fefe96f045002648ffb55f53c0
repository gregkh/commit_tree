memory hotplug: suppress "Device memoryX does not have a release() function" warning

When calling remove_memory_block(), the function shows following message
at device_release().

"Device 'memory528' does not have a release() function, it is broken and
must be fixed."

The reason is memory_block's device struct does not have a release()
function.

So the patch registers memory_block_release() to the device's release()
function for suppressing the warning message.  Additionally, the patch
moves kfree(mem) into the release function since the release function is
prepared as a means to free a memory_block struct.
