atm/iphase: rename fregt_t -> ffreg_t

We have conflicting type qualifiers for "freg_t" in s390's ptrace.h and the
iphase atm device driver, which causes the compile error below.
Unfortunately the s390 typedef can't be renamed, since it's a user visible api,
nor can I change the include order in s390 code to avoid the conflict.

So simply rename the iphase typedef to a new name. Fixes this compile error:
