TTY: move devpts kill to pty

Now that we have control over tty->driver_data in pty, we can just
kill the /dev/pts/ in pty code too. Namely, in ->shutdown hook of
tty. For pty, this is called only once, for whichever end is closed
last. But we don't care, both driver_data are the inode as it used to
be till now.
