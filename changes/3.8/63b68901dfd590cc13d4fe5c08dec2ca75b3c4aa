mfd: omap-usb-host: get rid of cpu_is_omap..() macros

Instead of using cpu_is_omap..() macros in the device driver we
rely on information provided in the platform data.

The only information we need is whether the USB Host module has
a single ULPI bypass control bit for all ports or individual bypass
control bits for each port. OMAP3 REV2.1 and earlier have the former.
