PCI: Remove spurious error for sriov_numvfs store and simplify flow

If we request "num_vfs" and the driver's sriov_configure() method enables
exactly that number ("num_vfs_enabled"), we complain "Invalid value for
number of VFs to enable" and return an error.  We should silently return
success instead.

Also, use kstrtou16() since numVFs is defined to be a 16-bit field and
rework to simplify control flow.
