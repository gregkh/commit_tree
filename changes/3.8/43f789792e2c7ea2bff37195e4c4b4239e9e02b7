drm/nvc0/fb: fix crash when different mutex is used to protect same list

Fixes regression introduced in commit 861d2107
"drm/nouveau/fb: merge fb/vram and port to subdev interfaces"

nv50_fb_vram_{new,del} functions were changed to use
nouveau_subdev->mutex instead of the old nouveau_mm->mutex.
nvc0_fb_vram_new still uses the nouveau_mm->mutex, but nvc0 doesn't
have its own fb_vram_del function, using nv50_fb_vram_del instead.
Because of this, on nvc0 a different mutex ends up being used to protect
additions and deletions to the same list.

This patch is a -stable candidate for 3.7.
