efi: Fix the build with user namespaces enabled.

When compiling efivars.c the build fails with:

   CC      drivers/firmware/efivars.o
  drivers/firmware/efivars.c: In function ‘efivarfs_get_inode’:
  drivers/firmware/efivars.c:886:31: error: incompatible types when assigning to type ‘kgid_t’ from type ‘int’
  make[2]: *** [drivers/firmware/efivars.o] Error 1
  make[1]: *** [drivers/firmware/efivars.o] Error 2

Fix the build error by removing the duplicate initialization of i_uid and
i_gid inode_init_always has already initialized them to 0.
