serial: sh-sci: console runtime PM support (revisit)

The commit 1ba7622094 (serial: sh-sci: console Runtime PM support,
from Magnus Damm <damm@opensource.se>, 2011-08-03), tried to support
console runtime PM, but unfortunately it didn't work for us for some
reason.  We did not investigated further at that time, instead would
like to propose a different approach.

In Linux tty/serial world, to get console PM work properly, a serial
client driver does not have to maintain .runtime_suspend()/..resume()
calls itself, but can leave console power power management handling to
the serial core driver.

This patch moves the sh-sci driver in that direction.

Notes:

* There is room to optimize console runtime PM more aggressively by
  maintaining additional local runtime PM calls, but as a first step
  having .pm() operation would suffice.

* We still have a couple of direct calls to sci_port_enable/..disable
  left in the driver.  We have to live with them, because they're out
  of serial core's help.
