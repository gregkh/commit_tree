doc: Add x86 CPU0 online/offline feature

If CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU0 is turned on, CPU0 is hotpluggable. Otherwise,
by default CPU0 is not hotpluggable and kernel parameter cpu0_hotplug enables
CPU0 online/offline feature.

The documentations point out two known CPU0 dependencies. First, resume from
hibernate or suspend always starts from CPU0. So hibernate and suspend are
prevented if CPU0 is offline. Another dependency is PIC interrupts always go
to CPU0.

It's said that some machines may depend on CPU0 to poweroff/reboot. But I
haven't seen such dependency on a few tested machines.

Please let me know if you see any CPU0 dependencies on your machine.
