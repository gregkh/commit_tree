mm: numa: Create basic numa page hinting infrastructure

Note: This patch started as "mm/mpol: Create special PROT_NONE
	infrastructure" and preserves the basic idea but steals *very*
	heavily from "autonuma: numa hinting page faults entry points" for
	the actual fault handlers without the migration parts.	The end
	result is barely recognisable as either patch so all Signed-off
	and Reviewed-bys are dropped. If Peter, Ingo and Andrea are ok with
	this version, I will re-add the signed-offs-by to reflect the history.

In order to facilitate a lazy -- fault driven -- migration of pages, create
a special transient PAGE_NUMA variant, we can then use the 'spurious'
protection faults to drive our migrations from.

The meaning of PAGE_NUMA depends on the architecture but on x86 it is
effectively PROT_NONE. Actual PROT_NONE mappings will not generate these
NUMA faults for the reason that the page fault code checks the permission on
the VMA (and will throw a segmentation fault on actual PROT_NONE mappings),
before it ever calls handle_mm_fault.
