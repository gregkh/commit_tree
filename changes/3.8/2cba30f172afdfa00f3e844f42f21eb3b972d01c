Btrfs: fix missed transaction->aborted check

First, though the current transaction->aborted check can stop the commit early
and avoid unnecessary operations, it is too early, and some transaction handles
don't end, those handles may set transaction->aborted after the check.

Second, when we commit the transaction, we will wake up some worker threads to
flush the space cache and inode cache. Those threads also allocate some transaction
handles and may set transaction->aborted if some serious error happens.

So we need more check for ->aborted when committing the transaction. Fix it.
