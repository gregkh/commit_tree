USB: hub: handle claim of enabled remote wakeup after reset

Some touchscreens have buggy firmware which claims
remote wakeup to be enabled after a reset. They nevertheless
crash if the feature is cleared by the host.
Add a check for reset resume before checking for
an enabled remote wakeup feature. On compliant
devices the feature must be cleared after a reset anyway.
