perf tools: Further speed up the perf build

There's another source of overhead in the perf version string generator:

   git update-index -q --refresh

... which will iterate the whole checked out tree. This can be pretty
slow on NFS volumes, but takes some time even with local SSD disks and a
fully cached kernel tree:

 $ perf stat --null --repeat 3 --pre "rm -f PERF-VERSION-FILE" util/PERF-VERSION-GEN
 PERF_VERSION = 3.7.rc3.g5399b3b.dirty
 PERF_VERSION = 3.7.rc3.g5399b3b.dirty
 PERF_VERSION = 3.7.rc3.g5399b3b.dirty

 Performance counter stats for 'util/PERF-VERSION-GEN' (3 runs):

       0.306999221 seconds time elapsed                                          ( +-  0.56% )

So remove the .dirty differentiator as well - it adds little information
because locally patched git trees are common, but seldom are the perf
tools modified.

So a lot of version strings are reported as 'dirty' while in fact they
are pristine perf builds. For example 99% of my perf builds are not
patched but the kernel tree is slightly patched, which adds the .dirty
tag.

Eliminating that tag speeds up version generation by another order of
magnitude:

 $ perf stat --null --repeat 3 --sync --pre "rm -f PERF-VERSION-FILE" util/PERF-VERSION-GEN
 PERF_VERSION = 3.7.rc3.g4b0bd3
 PERF_VERSION = 3.7.rc3.g4b0bd3
 PERF_VERSION = 3.7.rc3.g4b0bd3

 Performance counter stats for 'util/PERF-VERSION-GEN' (3 runs):

       0.021270923 seconds time elapsed                                          ( +-  1.94% )

(Also clean up some of the comments around this code.)
