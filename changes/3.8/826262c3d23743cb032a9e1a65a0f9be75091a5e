mac80211: fix dtim_period in hidden SSID AP association

When AP's SSID is hidden the BSS can appear several times in
cfg80211's BSS list: once with a zero-length SSID that comes
from the beacon, and once for each SSID from probe reponses.

Since the mac80211 stores its data in ieee80211_bss which
is embedded into cfg80211_bss, mac80211's data will be
duplicated too.

This becomes a problem when a driver needs the dtim_period
since this data exists only in the beacon's instance in
cfg80211 bss table which isn't the instance that is used
when associating.

Remove the DTIM period from the BSS table and track it
explicitly to avoid this problem.
