OMAPDSS: DPI: verify if DSI PLL is operational

The SoCs that have DSI module should have a working DSI PLL. However,
some rare boards have not connected the powers to the DSI PLL.

This patch adds a function that tries to power up the DSI PLL, and
reports if that doesn't succeed. DPI uses this function to fall back to
PRCM clocks if DSI PLL doesn't work.
