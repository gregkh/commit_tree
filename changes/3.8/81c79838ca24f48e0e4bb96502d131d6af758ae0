TTY: pty, fix tty buffers leak

After commit "TTY: move tty buffers to tty_port", the tty buffers are
not freed in some drivers. This is because tty_port_destructor is not
called whenever a tty_port is freed. This was an assumption I counted
with but was unfortunately untrue. So fix the drivers to fulfil this
assumption.

PTY is one of those, here we just need to use tty_port_put instead of
kfree. (Assuming tty_port_destructor does not need port->ops to be set
which we change here too.)
