ARM: 7568/1: Sort exception table at compile time

Add the ARM machine identifier to sortextable and select the
config option so that we can sort the exception table at compile
time. sortextable relies on a section named __ex_table existing
in the vmlinux, but ARM's linker script places the exception
table in the data section. Give the exception table its own
section so that sortextable can find it.

This allows us to skip the sorting step during boot.
