perf tools: Use normalized arch name for searching objdump path

David reported that perf report for i686 target data on x86_64 host
failed to work because it tried to find out cross-compiled objdump.

However objdump for x86_64 is compatible to i686 so that it doesn't need
to do it at all.  To prevent similar artifacts, normalize arch name when
comparing host and file architectures.
