slub: Commonize slab_cache field in struct page

Right now, slab and slub have fields in struct page to derive which
cache a page belongs to, but they do it slightly differently.

slab uses a field called slab_cache, that lives in the third double
word. slub, uses a field called "slab", living outside of the
doublewords area.

Ideally, we could use the same field for this. Since slub heavily makes
use of the doubleword region, there isn't really much room to move
slub's slab_cache field around. Since slab does not have such strict
placement restrictions, we can move it outside the doubleword area.

The naming used by slab, "slab_cache", is less confusing, and it is
preferred over slub's generic "slab".
