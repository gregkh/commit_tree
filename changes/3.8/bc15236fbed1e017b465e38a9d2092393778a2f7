powerpc/mpc85xx: Change spin table to cached memory

ePAPR v1.1 requires the spin table to be in cached memory. So we need
to change the call argument of ioremap to enable cache and coherence.
We also flush the cache after writing to spin table to keep it compatible
with previous cache-inhibit spin table. Flushing before and after
accessing spin table is recommended by ePAPR.
