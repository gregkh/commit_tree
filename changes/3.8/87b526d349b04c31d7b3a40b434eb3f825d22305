seccomp: Make syscall skipping and nr changes more consistent

This fixes two issues that could cause incompatibility between
kernel versions:

 - If a tracer uses SECCOMP_RET_TRACE to select a syscall number
   higher than the largest known syscall, emulate the unknown
   vsyscall by returning -ENOSYS.  (This is unlikely to make a
   noticeable difference on x86-64 due to the way the system call
   entry works.)

 - On x86-64 with vsyscall=emulate, skipped vsyscalls were buggy.

This updates the documentation accordingly.
