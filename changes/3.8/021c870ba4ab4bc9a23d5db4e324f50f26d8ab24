PM / QoS: Prepare struct dev_pm_qos_request for more request types

The subsequent patches will use struct dev_pm_qos_request for
representing both latency requests and flags requests.  To make that
easier, put the node member of struct dev_pm_qos_request (under the
name "pnode") into a union called "data" that will represent the
request's  value and list node depending on its type.
