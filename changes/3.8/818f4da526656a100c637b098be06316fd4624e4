tipc: remove supportable flag from bclink structure

The "supportable" flag in bclink structure is a compatibility flag
indicating whether a peer node is capable of receiving TIPC broadcast
messages. However, all TIPC versions since tipc-1.5, and after the
inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel in 2006, support this capability.
It is highly unlikely that anybody is still using such an old
version of TIPC, let alone that they want to mix it with TIPC-2.0
nodes. Therefore, we now remove the "supportable" flag.
