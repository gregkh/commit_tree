rbd: simplify rbd_merge_bvec()

The aim of this patch is to make what's going on rbd_merge_bvec() a
bit more obvious than it was before.  This was an issue when a
recent btrfs bug led us to question whether the merge function was
working correctly.

Use "obj" rather than "chunk" to indicate the units whose boundaries
we care about we call (rados) "objects".
