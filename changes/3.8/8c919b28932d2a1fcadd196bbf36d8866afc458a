drm/i915: Clear the existing watermarks for g4x when modifying the cursor sr

In a couple of places we attempt to adjust the existing watermark
registers to update them for the new cursor watermarks. This goes
horribly wrong as instead of clearing the cursor bits prior to or'ing in
the new values, we clear the rest of the register with the result that
the watermark registers contain bogus values.
