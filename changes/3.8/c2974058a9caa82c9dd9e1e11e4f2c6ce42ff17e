memory-hotplug: document and enable CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE

Add help info for CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE and permit its selection.

This option allows the user to online all memory of a node as movable
memory.  So that the whole node can be hotplugged.  Users who don't use
the hotplug feature are also fine with this option on since they won't
online memory as movable.
