i2c: i2c-gpio: fix name issue with multiple i2c gpio nodes

When having multiple i2c-gpio nodes, the name for each is same.
So add the patch to fix it.

The adap->name printing information was added by myself

without this patch the log information is as following
---<8---
adap->name = i2c-gpio-1
i2c-gpio i2c.2: using pins 30 (SDA) and 31 (SCL)
adap->name = i2c-gpio-1
i2c-gpio i2c.3: using pins 64 (SDA) and 65 (SCL)
--->8---

with this patch, the log information is as following
---<8---
adap->name = i2c.2
i2c-gpio i2c.2: using pins 30 (SDA) and 31 (SCL)
adap->name = i2c.3
i2c-gpio i2c.3: using pins 64 (SDA) and 65 (SCL)
--->8---
