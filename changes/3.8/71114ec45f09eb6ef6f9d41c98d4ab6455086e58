aoe: use dynamic number of remote ports for AoE storage target

Many AoE targets have four or fewer network ports, but some existing
storage devices have many, and the AoE protocol sets no limit.

This patch allows the use of more than eight remote MAC addresses per AoE
target, while reducing the amount of memory used by the aoe driver in
cases where there are many AoE targets with fewer than eight MAC addresses
each.
