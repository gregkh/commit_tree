ACPI / PM: Move device power state selection routine to device_pm.c

The ACPI function for choosing device power state is now located
in drivers/acpi/sleep.c, but drivers/acpi/device_pm.c is a more
logical place for it, so move it there.

However, instead of moving the function entirely, move its core only
under a different name and with a different list of arguments, so
that it is more flexible, and leave a wrapper around it in the
original location.
