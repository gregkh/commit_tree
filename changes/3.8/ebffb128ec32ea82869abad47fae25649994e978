staging: comedi: APCI1710_Pwm: remove forward declarations

This source file is #include'd when building the addi_apci_1710 driver.
All the functions in this file are actually static and should not be
exported to the kernel.

Move some of the functions to remove the need for the forward declarations
and make all of the functions in this file static. Note, this patch does
not try to fix any of the coding style issues in the functions.
