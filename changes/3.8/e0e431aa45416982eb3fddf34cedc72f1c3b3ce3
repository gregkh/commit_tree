alpha: simplify fork and friends

* no need to restore everything from switch_stack when we only need $26
* no need to pass current_pt_regs() manually, we can just as easily
calculate it in alpha_clone/alpha_vfork ($8 + constant)
* interpretation of zero usp as "use the parent's" is simpler in copy_thread();
let fork and vfork just pass 0.
