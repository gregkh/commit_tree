	'__muldi3' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/microblaze/lib/cmpdi2.c:5:11: warning: symbol

arch/microblaze/lib/lshrdi3.c:5:11: warning: symbol
	'__lshrdi3' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/microblaze/lib/ashrdi3.c:5:11: warning: symbol

arch/microblaze/lib/ucmpdi2.c:5:11: warning: symbol
