netfilter: nf_nat: Also handle non-ESTABLISHED routing changes in MASQUERADE

Since (a0ecb85 netfilter: nf_nat: Handle routing changes in MASQUERADE
target), the MASQUERADE target handles routing changes which affect
the output interface of a connection, but only for ESTABLISHED
connections.  It is also possible for NEW connections which
already have a conntrack entry to be affected by routing changes.

This adds a check to drop entries in the NEW+conntrack state
when the oif has changed.
