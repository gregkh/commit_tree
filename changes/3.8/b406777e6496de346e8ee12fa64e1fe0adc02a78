drbd: introduce completion_ref and kref to struct drbd_request

cherry-picked and adapted from drbd 9 devel branch

completion_ref will count pending events necessary for completion.
kref is for destruction.

This only introduces these new members of struct drbd_request,
a followup patch will make actual use of them.
