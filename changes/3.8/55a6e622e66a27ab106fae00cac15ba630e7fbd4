arch/x86/tools/insn_sanity.c: Identify source of messages

The kernel build prints:

  Building modules, stage 2.
  TEST    posttest
  MODPOST 3821 modules
  TEST    posttest
 Success: decoded and checked 1000000 random instructions with 0
 errors (seed:0xaac4bc47)   CC      arch/x86/boot/a20.o
  CC      arch/x86/boot/cmdline.o
  AS      arch/x86/boot/copy.o
  HOSTCC  arch/x86/boot/mkcpustr
  CC      arch/x86/boot/cpucheck.o
  CC      arch/x86/boot/early_serial_console.o

which is irritating because you don't know what program is
proudly pronouncing its success.

So, as described in "console mode programming user interface
guidelines version 101" which doesn't exist, change this program
to identify the source of its messages.
