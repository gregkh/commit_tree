ixgbe: remove needless queuing for L4 ptp packets

This patch removes the queuing that was previously done for L4 packets
as it is not needed. The filter does not provide functionality, and it
is possible that queue setup here could trample settings done else-where
in the driver. (for example it may use a queue which isn't setup.)
Setting of the queue is not required for hardware timestamping and could
have inadverdent side effects.
