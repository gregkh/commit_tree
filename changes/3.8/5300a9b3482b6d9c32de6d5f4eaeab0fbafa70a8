cgroup_freezer: add ->post_create() and ->pre_destroy() and track online state

A cgroup is online and visible to iteration between ->post_create()
and ->pre_destroy().  This patch introduces CGROUP_FREEZER_ONLINE and
toggles it from the newly added freezer_post_create() and
freezer_pre_destroy() while holding freezer->lock such that a
cgroup_freezer can be reilably distinguished to be online.  This will
be used by full hierarchy support.

ONLINE test is added to freezer_apply_state() but it currently doesn't
make any difference as freezer_write() can only be called for an
online cgroup.

Adjusting system_freezing_cnt on destruction is moved from
freezer_destroy() to the new freezer_pre_destroy() for consistency.

This patch doesn't introduce any noticeable behavior change.
