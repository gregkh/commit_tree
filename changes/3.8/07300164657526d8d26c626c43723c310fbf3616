mtd: de-select the chip when it is not used

When we scan several nand chips with nand_scan(), such as
     .......................
      nand_scan(*, 2);
     .......................

In nand_scan_ident(), the maxchips will become 2, so the current code
will select chip 1 to read the device ID. But the chip 0 is still
selected in this case.

To make the logic clear, we'd better de-select the chip when it is not used.

This patch de-select the nand chip if it is not used any more.
