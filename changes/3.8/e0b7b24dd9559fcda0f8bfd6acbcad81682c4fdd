ACPI / memhotplug: free memory device if acpi_memory_enable_device() failed

If acpi_memory_enable_device() fails, acpi_memory_enable_device() will
return a non-zero value, which means we fail to bind the memory device to
this driver.  So we should free memory device before
acpi_memory_device_add() returns.
