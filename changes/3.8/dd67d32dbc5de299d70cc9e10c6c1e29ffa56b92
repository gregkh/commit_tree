freezer: add missing mb's to freezer_count() and freezer_should_skip()

A task is considered frozen enough between freezer_do_not_count() and
freezer_count() and freezers use freezer_should_skip() to test this
condition.  This supposedly works because freezer_count() always calls
try_to_freezer() after clearing %PF_FREEZER_SKIP.

However, there currently is nothing which guarantees that
freezer_count() sees %true freezing() after clearing %PF_FREEZER_SKIP
when freezing is in progress, and vice-versa.  A task can escape the
freezing condition in effect by freezer_count() seeing !freezing() and
freezer_should_skip() seeing %PF_FREEZER_SKIP.

This patch adds smp_mb()'s to freezer_count() and
freezer_should_skip() such that either %true freezing() is visible to
freezer_count() or !PF_FREEZER_SKIP is visible to
freezer_should_skip().
