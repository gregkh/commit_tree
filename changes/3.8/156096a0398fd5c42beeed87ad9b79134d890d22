staging: comedi: rename old auto-config functions

Rename `comedi_auto_config()` to `comedi_old_auto_config()`, and
`comedi_auto_config_wrapper()` to `comedi_old_auto_config_wrapper()`.
These functions are deprecated and will be removed once the few
remaining low-level comedi drivers that use them have been updated.
(The low-level drivers in question support auto-configuration of
detected comedi devices, but still use the `attach()` hook in their
`struct comedi_driver` to do so.)

This internal change frees up the name `comedi_auto_config` for future
use.
