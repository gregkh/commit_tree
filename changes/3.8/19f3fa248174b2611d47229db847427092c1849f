rt2800: limit TX_PWR_CFG_ values to 0xc

Based on AsicAdjustTxPower function from vendor driver
(2011_0719_RT3070_RT3370_RT5370_RT5372_Linux_STA_V2.5.0.3_DPO)
limit per rate TX power values we program into TX_PWR_CFG_ registers.

Note that on some configurations (devices/rates) is allowed to use
bigger values than 0xc, but we use safe maximum value for now. Further
work need to be done to allow use bigger values than 0xc.
