HID: multitouch: move ALWAYS_VALID quirk check

Win 8 device specification changed the requirements for the hid usages
of the multitouch devices. Now InRange is optional and must be only
used when the device supports hovering.

This ensures that the quirk ALWAYS_VALID is taken into account and
also ensures its precedence over the other VALID* quirks.
