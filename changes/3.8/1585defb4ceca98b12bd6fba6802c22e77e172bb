ARM: vexpress: extend the MPIDR range used for pen release check

In ARM multi-cluster systems the MPIDR affinity level 0 cannot be used as a
single cpu identifier, affinity levels 1 and 2 must be taken into account as
well.
This patch extends the MPIDR usage to affinity levels 1 and 2 in versatile
secondary cores start up code in order to compare the passed pen_release
value with the full-blown affinity mask.
