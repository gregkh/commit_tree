cpufreq: governors: remove redundant code

Initially ondemand governor was written and then using its code conservative
governor is written. It used a lot of code from ondemand governor, but copy of
code was created instead of using the same routines from both governors. Which
increased code redundancy, which is difficult to manage.

This patch is an attempt to move common part of both the governors to
cpufreq_governor.c file to come over above mentioned issues.

This shouldn't change anything from functionality point of view.
