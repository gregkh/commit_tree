swiotlb: Use physical addresses for swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single

This change makes it so that the unmap functionality also uses physical
addresses.  This helps to further reduce the use of virt_to_phys and
phys_to_virt functions.

In order to clarify things since we now have 2 physical addresses in use
inside of swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single I am renaming phys to orig_addr, and
dma_addr to tlb_addr.  This way is should be clear that orig_addr is
contained within io_orig_addr and tlb_addr is an address within the
io_tlb_addr buffer.
