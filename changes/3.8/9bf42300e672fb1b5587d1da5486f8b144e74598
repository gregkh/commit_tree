Commit ba68c8530a263dc4de440fa10bb20a1c5b9d4ff5 (Partly revert "[media]
uvcvideo: Set error_idx properly for extended controls API failures")
also reverted part of commit 30ecb936cbcd83e3735625ac63e1b4466546f5fe
("uvcvideo: Return -EACCES when trying to access a read/write-only
control") by mistake. Fix it.
