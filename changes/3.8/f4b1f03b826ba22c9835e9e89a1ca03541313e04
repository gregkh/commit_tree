serial: mxs-auart: distinguish the different SOCs

The current mxs-auart driver is used for both mx23 and mx28.

But in mx23, the DMA has a bug(see errata:2836). We can not add the
DMA support in mx23, but we can add DMA support to auart in mx28.

So in order to add the DMA support for the auart in mx28, we should
distinguish the distinguish SOCs.

This patch adds a new platform_device_id table and a inline function
is_imx28_auart() to distinguish the mx23 and mx28.
