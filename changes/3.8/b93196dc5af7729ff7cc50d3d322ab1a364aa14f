net: fix some compiler warning in net/core/neighbour.c

net/core/neighbour.c:65:12: warning: 'zero' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
net/core/neighbour.c:66:12: warning: 'unres_qlen_max' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

These variables are only used when CONFIG_SYSCTL is defined,
so move them under #ifdef CONFIG_SYSCTL.
