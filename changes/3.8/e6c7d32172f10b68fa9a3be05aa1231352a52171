KVM: VMX: fix invalid cpu passed to smp_call_function_single

In loaded_vmcs_clear, loaded_vmcs->cpu is the fist parameter passed to
smp_call_function_single, if the target cpu is downing (doing cpu hot remove),
loaded_vmcs->cpu can become -1 then -1 is passed to smp_call_function_single

It can be triggered when vcpu is being destroyed, loaded_vmcs_clear is called
in the preemptionable context
