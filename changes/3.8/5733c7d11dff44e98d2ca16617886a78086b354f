mm: introduce putback_movable_pages()

The PATCH "mm: introduce compaction and migration for virtio ballooned pages"
hacks around putback_lru_pages() in order to allow ballooned pages to be
re-inserted on balloon page list as if a ballooned page was like a LRU page.

As ballooned pages are not legitimate LRU pages, this patch introduces
putback_movable_pages() to properly cope with cases where the isolated
pageset contains ballooned pages and LRU pages, thus fixing the mentioned
inelegant hack around putback_lru_pages().
