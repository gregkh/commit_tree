mfd: sta2x11-mfd: Add sta2x11_mfd_get_regs_data() function

A couple of predefined clocks (mux and gated) need to be
initialized with the virtual address of the clock's controlling
register and the address of a spinlock used to protect against
races.

This function exports such data for all the mfd cells.
