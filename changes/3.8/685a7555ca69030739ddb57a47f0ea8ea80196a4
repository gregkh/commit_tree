libceph: avoid using freed osd in __kick_osd_requests()

If an osd has no requests and no linger requests, __reset_osd()
will just remove it with a call to __remove_osd().  That drops
a reference to the osd, and therefore the osd may have been free
by the time __reset_osd() returns.  That function offers no
indication this may have occurred, and as a result the osd will
continue to be used even when it's no longer valid.

Change__reset_osd() so it returns an error (ENODEV) when it
deletes the osd being reset.  And change __kick_osd_requests() so it
returns immediately (before referencing osd again) if __reset_osd()
returns *any* error.
