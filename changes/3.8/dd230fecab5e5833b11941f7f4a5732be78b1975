efi_pstore: Add a logic erasing entries to an erase callback

[Issue]

Currently, efi_pstore driver simply overwrites existing panic messages in NVRAM.
So, in the following scenario, we will lose 1st panic messages.

 1. kernel panics.
 2. efi_pstore is kicked and writes panic messages to NVRAM.
 3. system reboots.
 4. kernel panics again before a user checks the 1st panic messages in NVRAM.

[Solution]

A reasonable solution to fix the issue is just holding multiple logs without erasing
existing entries.

This patch freshly adds a logic erasing existing entries, which shared with a write callback,
to an erase callback.
To support holding multiple logs, the write callback doesn't need to erase any entries and
it will be removed in a subsequent patch.
