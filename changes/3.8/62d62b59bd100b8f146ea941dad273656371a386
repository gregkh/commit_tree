mfd: arizona: Defer patch initialistation until after first device boot

Make sure that we don't race with the initial device boot by only doing
the initialisation after we've waited for the boot to complete.

The runtime PM code already waits for the boot to complete before it
syncs the register patches so in most systems if a race does occur we will
power down very soon afterwards and recover anyway.
