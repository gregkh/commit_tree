eCryptfs: fix to use list_for_each_entry_safe() when delete items

Since we will be removing items off the list using list_del() we need
to use a safer version of the list_for_each_entry() macro aptly named
list_for_each_entry_safe(). We should use the safe macro if the loop
involves deletions of items.
