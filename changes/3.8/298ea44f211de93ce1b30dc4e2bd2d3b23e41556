ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: ipu and dsp to use parent clocks instead of leaf clocks

This prevents hwmod _enable_clocks...omap2_dflt_clk_enable path
from enabling modulemode inside CLKCTRL using its clk->enable_reg
field. Instead is left to _omap4_enable_module though soc_ops, as
the one in charge of this setting.

According to comments received[1] for related patches the idea is
to get rid of leaf clocks in future. So remove these two while at it.
