rbd: let con_work() handle backoff

Both ceph_fault() and con_work() include handling for imposing a
delay before doing further processing on a faulted connection.
The latter is used only if ceph_fault() is unable to.

Instead, just let con_work() always be responsible for implementing
the delay.  After setting up the delay value, set the BACKOFF flag
on the connection unconditionally and call queue_con() to ensure
con_work() will get called to handle it.
