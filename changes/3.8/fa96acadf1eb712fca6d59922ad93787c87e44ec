xfs: move inode locking functions to xfs_inode.c

xfs_ilock() and friends really aren't related to the inode cache in
any way, so move them to xfs_inode.c with all the other inode
related functionality.

While doing this move, move the xfs_ilock() tracepoints to *before*
the lock is taken so that when a hang on a lock occurs we have
events to indicate which process and what inode we were trying to
lock when the hang occurred. This is much better than the current
silence we get on a hang...
