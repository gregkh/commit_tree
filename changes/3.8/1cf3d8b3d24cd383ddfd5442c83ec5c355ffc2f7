powerpc+of: Add of node/property notification chain for adds and removes

This patch moves the notification chain for updates to the device tree
from the powerpc/pseries code to the base OF code. This makes this
functionality available to all architectures.

Additionally the notification chain is updated to allow notifications
for property add/remove/update. To make this work a pointer to a new
struct (of_prop_reconfig) is passed to the routines in the notification chain.
The of_prop_reconfig property contains a pointer to the node containing the
property and a pointer to the property itself. In the case of property
updates, the property pointer refers to the new property.
