mm: introduce a common interface for balloon pages mobility

Memory fragmentation introduced by ballooning might reduce significantly
the number of 2MB contiguous memory blocks that can be used within a guest,
thus imposing performance penalties associated with the reduced number of
transparent huge pages that could be used by the guest workload.

This patch introduces a common interface to help a balloon driver on
making its page set movable to compaction, and thus allowing the system
to better leverage the compation efforts on memory defragmentation.
