[SCSI] qla2xxx: Properly set result field of bsg_job reply structure for success and failure.

FC transport on receiving bsg_job submission failure, calls bsg_job->job_done()
and sets the bsg_job->reply->result the returned value. In contrast, when the
success code (0) is returned fc transport doesn't call bsg_job->job_done() and
doesn't populate bsg_job->reply->result.
