ACPI: Pass segment/bus to _PRT add/del so they don't depend on pci_bus

This effectively reverts 859a3f86ca8 ("ACPI: simplify
acpi_pci_irq_add_prt() API") and d9efae3688a ("ACPI: simplify
acpi_pci_irq_del_prt() API").

The reason is to disentangle these routines from the struct pci_bus.
We want to be able to add the _PRT before the struct pci_bus
exists, and delete the _PRT after we've removed the pci_bus.
