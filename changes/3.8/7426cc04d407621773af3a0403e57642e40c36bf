Btrfs: punch hole past the end of the file

Since we can pre-allocate the space past EOF, we should be able to reclaim
that space if we need. This patch implements it by removing the EOF check.

Though the manual of fallocate command says we can use truncate command to
reclaim the pre-allocated space which past EOF, but because truncate command
changes the file size, we must run several commands to reclaim the space if we
don't want to change the file size, so it is not a good choice.
