drbd: More random to the connect logic

Since the listening socket is open all the time, it was possible to
get into stable "initial packet S crossed" loops.

* when both sides realize in the drbd_socket_okay() call at the end
  of the loop that the other side closed the main socket you had
  the chance to get into a stable loop with repeated "packet S crossed"
  messages.

* when both sides do not realize with the drbd_socket_okay() call at the end
  of the loop that the other side closed the main socket you had
  the chance to get into a stable loop with alternating "packet S crossed"
  "packet M crossed" messages.

In order to break out these stable loops randomize the behaviour if
such a crossing of P_INITIAL_DATA or P_INITIAL_META packets is detected.
