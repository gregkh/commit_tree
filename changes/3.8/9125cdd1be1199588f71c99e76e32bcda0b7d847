stmmac: add the initial tx coalesce schema

This patch adds a new schema used for mitigating the
number of transmit interrupts.
It is based on a SW timer and a threshold value.
The timer is used to periodically call the stmmac_tx_clean
function; the threshold is used for setting the IC (Interrupt
on Completion bit). The ISR will then invoke the poll method.
Also the patch improves some ethtool stat fields.

V2: review the logic to manage the IC bit in the TDESC
that was bugged because it didn't take care about the
fragments. Also fix the tx_count_frames that has not to be
limited to TX DMA ring. Thanks to Ben Hutchings.

V3: removed the spin_lock irqsave/restore as D. Miller suggested.
