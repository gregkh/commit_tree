[media] v4l: vb2-dma-contig: add reference counting for a device from allocator context

This patch adds taking reference to the device for MMAP buffers.
Such buffers, may be exported using DMABUF mechanism. If the driver that
created a queue is unloaded then the queue is released, the device might be
released too.  However, buffers cannot be released if they are referenced by
DMABUF descriptor(s). The device pointer kept in a buffer must be valid for the
whole buffer's lifetime. Therefore MMAP buffers should take a reference to the
device to avoid risk of dangling pointers.
