tg3: Avoid null pointer dereference in tg3_interrupt in netconsole mode

When netconsole is enabled, logging messages generated during tg3_open
can result in a null pointer dereference for the uninitialized tg3
status block. Use the irq_sync flag to disable polling in the early
stages. irq_sync is cleared when the driver is enabling interrupts after
all initialization is completed.
