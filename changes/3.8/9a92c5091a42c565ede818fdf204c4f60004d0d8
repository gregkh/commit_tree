vfio-pci: Enable device before attempting reset

Devices making use of PM reset are getting incorrectly identified as
not supporting reset because pci_pm_reset() fails unless the device is
in D0 power state.  When first attached to vfio_pci devices are
typically in an unknown power state.  We can fix this by explicitly
setting the power state or simply calling pci_enable_device() before
attempting a pci_reset_function().  We need to enable the device
anyway, so move this up in our vfio_pci_enable() function, which also
simplifies the error path a bit.

Note that pci_disable_device() does not explicitly set the power
state, so there's no need to re-order vfio_pci_disable().
