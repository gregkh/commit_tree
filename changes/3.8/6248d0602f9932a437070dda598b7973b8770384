ARM: 7545/1: cache-l2x0: make outer_cache_fns a field of l2x0_of_data

Instead of having multiple functions belonging to outer_cache and
filling this structure on the fly, use a outer_cache_fns field inside
l2x0_of_data and just memcopy it into outer_cache depending of the
type of the l2x0 cache. For non DT case, the former code was kept.
