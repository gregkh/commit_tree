thermal: cpu cooling: use const parameter while registering

There are predefined cpu_masks that are const data structures.
This patch changes the cpu cooling register function so that
those const cpu_masks can be used, without compilation warnings.

include/linux/cpumask.h

 * The following particular system cpumasks and operations manage
 * possible, present, active and online cpus.
 *
 *     cpu_possible_mask- has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populatable
 *     cpu_present_mask - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated
 *     cpu_online_mask  - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to scheduler
 *     cpu_active_mask  - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to migration
 *
