mqueue selftests: print failure status instead of cause make error

Original behavior:
  bash-4.1$ make -C mqueue run_tests
  make: Entering directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/mqueue'
  ./mq_open_tests /test1
  Not running as root, but almost all tests require root in order to modify
  system settings.  Exiting.
  make: *** [run_tests] Error 1
  make: Leaving directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/mqueue'

After applying the patch:
  bash-4.1$ make -C mqueue run_tests
  make: Entering directory `/home/dave/git/linux-2.6/tools/testing/selftests/mqueue'
  Not running as root, but almost all tests require root in order to modify
  system settings.  Exiting.
  mq_open_tests: [FAIL]
