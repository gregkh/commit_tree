xen/privcmd: Relax access control in privcmd_ioctl_mmap

In the privcmd Linux driver two checks in the functions
privcmd_ioctl_mmap and privcmd_ioctl_mmap_batch are not needed as they
are trying to enforce hypervisor-level access control.  They should be
removed as they break secondary control domains when performing dom0
disaggregation. Xen itself provides adequate security controls around
these hypercalls and these checks prevent those controls from
functioning as intended.
