spi/pl022: Revert "spi/pl022: fix spi-pl022 pm enable at probe"

This reverts commit 6887237cd7da904184dab2750504040c68f3a080.

Commit "spi/pl022: enable runtime PM" introduced runtime PM issues.
Due to that commit, "spi/pl022: fix spi-pl022 pm enable at probe"
was merged to fix part of those issues.

Instead of adding another fix, let's clean up and revert everything
back to when it was already fine.
