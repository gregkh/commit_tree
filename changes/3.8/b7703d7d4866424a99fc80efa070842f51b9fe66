staging: comedi: jr3_pci: use auto_attach method

This driver does not need to support manual attachment of supported PCI
devices.  Replace the `attach()` hook (`jr3_pci_attach()`) with an
`auto_attach()` hook (`jr3_pci_auto_attach()`).  This will be called via
`comedi_pci_auto_config()` at PCI probe time.

This driver no longer increments the PCI reference count during
attachment, so remove the call to `pci_dev_put()` when detaching the
device.
