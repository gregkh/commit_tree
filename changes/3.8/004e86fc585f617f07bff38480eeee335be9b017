batman-adv: Fix broadcast duplist for fragmentation

If the skb is fragmented, the checksum must be computed on the
individual fragments, just using skb->data may fail on fragmented
data. Instead of doing linearizing the packet, use the new
batadv_crc32 to do that more efficiently- it should not hurt
replacing the old crc16 by the new crc32.
