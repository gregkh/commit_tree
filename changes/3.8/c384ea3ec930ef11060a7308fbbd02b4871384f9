batman-adv: Distributed ARP Table - add snooping functions for ARP messages

In case of an ARP message going in or out the soft_iface, it is intercepted and
a special action is performed. In particular the DHT helper functions previously
implemented are used to store all the ARP entries belonging to the network in
order to provide a fast and unicast lookup instead of the classic broadcast
flooding mechanism.
Each node stores the entries it is responsible for (following the DHT rules) in
its soft_iface ARP table. This makes it possible to reuse the kernel data
structures and functions for ARP management.
