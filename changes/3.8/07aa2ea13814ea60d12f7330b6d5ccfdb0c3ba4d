ext4: fix error handling in ext4_fill_super()

There are some places in ext4_fill_super() where we would not return
proper error code if something fails. The confusion is caused probably
due to the fact that we have two "kind-of" return variables 'ret'and
'err'.

'ret' is used to return error code from ext4_fill_super() where err is
used to store return values from other functions within ext4_fill_super().
However some places were missing the obligatory 'ret = err'. We could
put the assignment where it is missing, but we can have better "future
proof" solution. Or we could convert the code to use just one, but it
would require more rewrites.

This commit fixes the problem by returning value from 'err' variable if
it is set and 'ret' otherwise in error handling branch of the
ext4_fill_super(). The reasoning is that 'ret' value is often set to
default "-EINVAL" or explicit value, where 'err' is used to store
return value from other functions and should be otherwise zero.
