i2c: s3c2410: Remove recently introduced performance overheads

The changes in "i2c-s3c2410: use exponential back off while polling for
bus idle" remove the initial busy wait for I2C transfers to complete and
replace it with usleep_range() calls which will schedule.

Since for older SoCs I2C transfers would usually complete within an
extremely small number of CPU cycles there is a win from not having to
schedule.  This happens because on the older SoCs the cores run at a
smaller multiple of the speeds that the I2C bus is operating at; on more
modern SoCs the busy wait is less likely to be effective.

Fix the issue by restoring the busy wait, reducing the number of spins
from 20 to 3 which covers the overwhelming majority of I2C transfers on
the SoCs where the busy wait is effective.
