ARM: tegra: move debug-macro.S to include/debug

Move Tegra's debug-macro.S over to the common debug macro directory.

Move Tegra's debug UART selection menu into ARM's Kconfig.debug, so that
all related options are selected in the same place.

Tegra's uncompress.h is left in mach-tegra/include/mach; it will be
removed whenever Tegra is converted to multi-platform.
