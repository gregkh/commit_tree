ath9k: allow to load EEPROM content via firmware API

The calibration data for devices w/o a separate
EEPROM chip can be specified via the 'eeprom_data'
field of 'ath9k_platform_data'. The 'eeprom_data'
is usually filled from board specific setup
functions. It is easy if the EEPROM data is mapped
to the memory, but it can be complicated if it is
stored elsewhere.

The patch adds support for loading of the EEPROM
data via the firmware API to avoid this limitation.
