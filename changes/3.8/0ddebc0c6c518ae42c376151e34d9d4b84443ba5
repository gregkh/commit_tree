rbd: do all argument parsing in one place

This patch makes rbd_add_parse_args() be the single place all
argument parsing occurs for an image map request:
    - Move the ceph_parse_options() call into that function
    - Use local variables rather than parameters to hold the list
      of monitor addresses supplied
    - Rather than returning it, pass the snapshot name (and its
      length) back via parameters
    - Have the function return a ceph_options structure pointer
