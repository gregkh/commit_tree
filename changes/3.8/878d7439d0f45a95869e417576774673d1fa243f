rcu: Fix batch-limit size problem

Commit 29c00b4a1d9e27 (rcu: Add event-tracing for RCU callback
invocation) added a regression in rcu_do_batch()

Under stress, RCU is supposed to allow to process all items in queue,
instead of a batch of 10 items (blimit), but an integer overflow makes
the effective limit being 1.  So, unless there is frequent idle periods
(during which RCU ignores batch limits), RCU can be forced into a
state where it cannot keep up with the callback-generation rate,
eventually resulting in OOM.

This commit therefore converts a few variables in rcu_do_batch() from
int to long to fix this problem, along with the module parameters
controlling the batch limits.
