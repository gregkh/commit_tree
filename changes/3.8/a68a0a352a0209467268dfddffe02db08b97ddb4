GFS2: Speed up gfs2_rbm_from_block

This patch is a rewrite of function gfs2_rbm_from_block. Rather than
looping to find the right bitmap, the code now does a few simple
math calculations.

I compared the performance of both algorithms side by side and the new
algorithm is noticeably faster. Sample instrumentation output from a
"fast" machine:

5 million calls: millisec spent: Orig: 166 New: 113
5 million calls: millisec spent: Orig: 189 New: 114

In addition, I ran postmark (on a somewhat slowr CPU) before the after
the new algorithm was put in place and postmark showed a decent
improvement:

Before the new algorithm:
-------------------------
Time:
	645 seconds total
	584 seconds of transactions (171 per second)

Files:
	150087 created (232 per second)
		Creation alone: 100000 files (2083 per second)
		Mixed with transactions: 50087 files (85 per second)
	49995 read (85 per second)
	49991 appended (85 per second)
	150087 deleted (232 per second)
		Deletion alone: 100174 files (7705 per second)
		Mixed with transactions: 49913 files (85 per second)

Data:
	273.42 megabytes read (434.08 kilobytes per second)
	852.13 megabytes written (1.32 megabytes per second)

With the new algorithm:
-----------------------
Time:
	599 seconds total
	530 seconds of transactions (188 per second)

Files:
	150087 created (250 per second)
		Creation alone: 100000 files (1886 per second)
		Mixed with transactions: 50087 files (94 per second)
	49995 read (94 per second)
	49991 appended (94 per second)
	150087 deleted (250 per second)
		Deletion alone: 100174 files (6260 per second)
		Mixed with transactions: 49913 files (94 per second)

Data:
	273.42 megabytes read (467.42 kilobytes per second)
	852.13 megabytes written (1.42 megabytes per second)
