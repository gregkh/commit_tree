can: Do not call dev_put if restart timer is running upon close

If the restart timer is running due to BUS-OFF and the device is
disconnected an dev_put will decrease the usage counter to -1 thus
blocking the interface removal, resulting in the following dmesg
lines repeating every 10s:
can: notifier: receive list not found for dev can0
can: notifier: receive list not found for dev can0
can: notifier: receive list not found for dev can0
unregister_netdevice: waiting for can0 to become free. Usage count = -1
