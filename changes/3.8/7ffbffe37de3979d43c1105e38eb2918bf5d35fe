ssb: add methods for watchdog driver

The watchdog driver wants to set the watchdog timeout in ms and not in
ticks, which is depending on the SoC type and the clock.
Calculate the number of ticks per millisecond and provide two functions
for the watchdog driver. Also return the ticks or millisecond the timer
was set to in case the provided value was bigger than the max allowed
value.
