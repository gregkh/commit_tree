userns: Kill task_user_ns

The task_user_ns function hides the fact that it is getting the user
namespace from struct cred on the task.  struct cred may go away as
soon as the rcu lock is released.  This leads to a race where we
can dereference a stale user namespace pointer.

To make it obvious a struct cred is involved kill task_user_ns.

To kill the race modify the users of task_user_ns to only
reference the user namespace while the rcu lock is held.
