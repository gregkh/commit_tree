HID: i2c-hid: fix i2c_hid_output_raw_report

i2c_hid_output_raw_report is used by hidraw to forward set_report requests.
The current implementation of i2c_hid_set_report needs to take the
report_id as an argument. The report_id is stored in the first byte
of the buffer in argument of i2c_hid_output_raw_report.

Not removing the report_id from the given buffer adds this byte 2 times
in the command, leading to a non working command.
