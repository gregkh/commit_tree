drbd: fixup after wait_even_lock_irq() addition to generic code

Compiling drbd yields:

drivers/block/drbd/drbd_state.c: In function ‘_conn_request_state’:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_state.c:1804:5: error: macro "wait_event_lock_irq" passed 4 arguments, but takes just 3
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_state.c:1801:3: error: ‘wait_event_lock_irq’ undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_state.c:1801:3: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_state.c: At top level:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_state.c:1734:1: warning: ‘_conn_rq_cond’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Due to drbd having copied the MD definition for wait_event_lock_irq()
as well. Kill them.
