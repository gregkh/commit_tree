GFS2: Fix race in gfs2_rs_alloc

QE aio tests uncovered a race condition in gfs2_rs_alloc where it's possible
to come out of the function with a valid ip->i_res allocation but it gets
freed before use resulting in a NULL ptr dereference.

This patch envelopes the initial short-circuit check for non-NULL ip->i_res
into the mutex lock. With this patch, I was able to successfully run the
reproducer test multiple times.
