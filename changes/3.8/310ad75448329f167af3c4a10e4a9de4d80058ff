efi: Clarify GUID length calculations

At present, the handling of GUIDs in efivar file names isn't consistent.
We use GUID_LEN in some places, and 38 in others (GUID_LEN plus
separator), and implicitly use the presence of the trailing NUL.

This change removes the trailing NUL from GUID_LEN, so that we're
explicitly adding it when required. We also replace magic numbers
with GUID_LEN, and clarify the comments where appropriate.

We also fix the allocation size in efivar_create_sysfs_entry, where
we're allocating one byte too much, due to counting the trailing NUL
twice - once when calculating short_name_size, and once in the kzalloc.
