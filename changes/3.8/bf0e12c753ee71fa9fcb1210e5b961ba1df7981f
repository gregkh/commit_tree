microblaze: uaccess.h: Fix timerfd syscall

__pu_val must be volatile to ensure that the value is not lost.

It was causing the problem with timerfd syscall
where using inline asm at the end of function call doesn't
save u64 bit value to the stack.
In comparison both cases you can find out this fragment
where you can see the first part which is saved u64
value to stack and then using it in __put_user_asm_8 macro.
Origin broken implementation misses the first two swi instructions.

	swi	r22, r1, 28 /* missing without volatile */
	swi	r23, r1, 32
...
	addik	r4, r1, 28
	lwi	r3, r4, 0
	swi	r3, r25, 0
	lwi	r3, r4, 4
	swi	r3, r25, 4
	addk	r3, r0, r0

NOTE: Moving __put_val initialization after declaration
has not impact on this bug. It is just coding style issue.
