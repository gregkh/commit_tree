crypto: cast6/avx - avoid using temporary stack buffers

Introduce new assembler functions to avoid use temporary stack buffers in
glue code. This also allows use of vector instructions for xoring output
in CTR and CBC modes and construction of IVs for CTR mode.

ECB mode sees ~0.5% decrease in speed because added one extra function
call. CBC mode decryption and CTR mode benefit from vector operations
and gain ~2%.
