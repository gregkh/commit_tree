USB: option: blacklist network interface on Huawei E173

The Huawei E173 will normally appear as 12d1:1436 in Linux.  But
the modem has another mode with different device ID and a slightly
different set of descriptors. This is the mode used by Windows like
this:

  3Modem:      USB\VID_12D1&PID_140C&MI_00\6&3A1D2012&0&0000
  Networkcard: USB\VID_12D1&PID_140C&MI_01\6&3A1D2012&0&0001
  Appli.Inter: USB\VID_12D1&PID_140C&MI_02\6&3A1D2012&0&0002
  PC UI Inter: USB\VID_12D1&PID_140C&MI_03\6&3A1D2012&0&0003

All interfaces have the same ff/ff/ff class codes in this mode.
Blacklisting the network interface to allow it to be picked up by
the network driver.
