drbd: Call drbd_md_sync() explicitly after a state change on the connection

Without this, the meta-data gets updates after 5 seconds by the
md_sync_timer. Better to do it immeditaly after a state change.

If the asender detects a network failure, it may take a bit until
the worker processes the according after-conn-state-change work item.

  The worker might be blocked in sending something, i.e. it
  takes until it gets into its timeout. That is 6 seconds by
  default which is longer than the 5 seconds of the md_sync_timer.
