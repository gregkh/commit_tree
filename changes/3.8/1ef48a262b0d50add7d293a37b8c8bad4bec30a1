dma: mv_xor: merge mv_xor_device and mv_xor_chan

Even though the DMA engine infrastructure has support for multiple
channels per device, the mv_xor driver registers one DMA engine device
for each channel, because the mv_xor channels inside the same XOR
engine have different capabilities, and the DMA engine infrastructure
only allows to express capabilities at the DMA engine device level.

The mv_xor driver has therefore been registering one DMA engine device
and one DMA engine channel for each XOR channel since its introduction
in the kernel. However, it kept two separate internal structures,
mv_xor_device and mv_xor_channel, which didn't make a lot of sense
since there was a 1:1 mapping between those structures.

This patch gets rid of this duplication, and merges everything into
the mv_xor_chan structure.
