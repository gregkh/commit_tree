gpiolib: fix up function prototypes etc

Commit 69e1601bca88809dc118abd1becb02c15a02ec71
"gpiolib: provide provision to register pin ranges"

Got most of it's function prototypes wrong, so fix this up by:

- Moving the void declarations into static inlines in
  <linux/gpio.h> (previously the actual prototypes were declared
  here...)

- Declare the gpiochip_add_pin_range() and
  gpiochip_remove_pin_ranges() functions in <asm-generic/gpio.h>
  together with the pin range struct declaration itself.

- Actually only implement these very functions in gpiolib.c
  if CONFIG_PINCTRL is set.

- Additionally export the symbols since modules will need to
  be able to do this.
