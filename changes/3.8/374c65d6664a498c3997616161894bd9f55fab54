ixgbe: Add mailbox API version negotiation support to ixgbe PF

This change allows us to add a mailbox versioning API.  This will allow us
to determine the features supported by the VFs from the PF.  For example we
will be implementing a version 1.1 API for the VF that will indicate that
it can support us enabling Jumbo frames as the VF will support buffer
chaining.
