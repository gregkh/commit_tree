tracing,x86: Add a TSC trace_clock

In order to promote interoperability between userspace tracers and ftrace,
add a trace_clock that reports raw TSC values which will then be recorded
in the ring buffer. Userspace tracers that also record TSCs are then on
exactly the same time base as the kernel and events can be unambiguously
interlaced.

Tested: Enabled a tracepoint and the "tsc" trace_clock and saw very large
timestamp values.

v2:
Move arch-specific bits out of generic code.
v3:
Rename "x86-tsc", cleanups
v7:
Generic arch bits in Kbuild.
