ARM: OMAP4: PM: fix errata handling when CONFIG_PM=n

commit c9621844 (ARM: OMAP4: PM: add errata support) introduced errata
handling for OMAP4, but was broken when CONFIG_PM=n.

When CONFIG_PM=n, pm44xx.c is not compiled, yet that is where pm44xx_errata
is defined.  However, these errata are needed for the SMP boot/hotplug case
also, and are primarily used in omap-smp.c.

Move the definition of pm44xx_errata to omap-smp.c so that it's available
even in the CONFIG_PM=n case.
