PM / QoS: Make it possible to expose PM QoS device flags to user space

Define two device PM QoS flags, PM_QOS_FLAG_NO_POWER_OFF
and PM_QOS_FLAG_REMOTE_WAKEUP, and introduce routines
dev_pm_qos_expose_flags() and dev_pm_qos_hide_flags() allowing the
caller to expose those two flags to user space or to hide them
from it, respectively.

After the flags have been exposed, user space will see two
additional sysfs attributes, pm_qos_no_power_off and
pm_qos_remote_wakeup, under the device's /sys/devices/.../power/
directory.  Then, writing 1 to one of them will update the
PM QoS flags request owned by user space so that the corresponding
flag is requested to be set.  In turn, writing 0 to one of them
will cause the corresponding flag in the user space's request to
be cleared (however, the owners of the other PM QoS flags requests
for the same device may still request the flag to be set and it
may be effectively set even if user space doesn't request that).
