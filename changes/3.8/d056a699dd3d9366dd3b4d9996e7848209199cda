ARM: 7606/1: cache: flush to LoUU instead of LoUIS on uniprocessor CPUs

flush_cache_louis flushes the D-side caches to the point of unification
inner-shareable. On uniprocessor CPUs, this is defined as zero and
therefore no flushing will take place. Rather than invent a new interface
for UP systems, instead use our SMP_ON_UP patching code to read the
LoUU from the CLIDR instead.
