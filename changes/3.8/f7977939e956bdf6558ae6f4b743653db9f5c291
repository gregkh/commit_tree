zynq: remove use of CLKDEV_LOOKUP

The Zynq support in mainline does not (yet) make use of any of the
generic clk or clk lookup functionality.  Remove what is upstream for
now, until the out-of-tree implementation is in suitable form for
merging.

An important side effect of this patch is that it allows the building of
a Zynq kernel without running into unresolved symbol problems:

   clkdev.c:(.text+0x444): undefined reference to `clk_enable'

In addition, eliminate Zynq's "use" of the versatile platform, as it is
no longer needed.  As Nick Bowler points out:

   For the record, I think this was introduced by commit 56a34b03ff427
   ("ARM: versatile: Make plat-versatile clock optional") which forgot to
   select PLAT_VERSATILE_CLOCK on Zynq.  This is not all that surprising,
   because the fact that Zynq "uses" PLAT_VERSATILE is secretly hidden in
   the Makefile.

   Nevertheless, the only feature from versatile that Zynq needed was the
   clock support, so this patch should *also* delete the secret use of
   plat-versatile by removing this line from arch/arm/Makefile:

      plat-$(CONFIG_ARCH_ZYNQ)      += versatile
