arch/x86/Kconfig: Allow turning off CONFIG_X86_MPPARSE when either ACPI or SFI is present

MPS tables are not needed for systems that have proper ACPI
support. This is also true for systems that have SFI in place.

So this patch allows the configuration (turning off) of
CONFIG_X86_MPPARSE when either ACPI or SFI is present.
