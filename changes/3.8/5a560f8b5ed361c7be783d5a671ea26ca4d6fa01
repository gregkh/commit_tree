KVM: VMX: fix memory order between loading vmcs and clearing vmcs

vmcs->cpu indicates whether it exists on the target cpu, -1 means the vmcs
does not exist on any vcpu

If vcpu load vmcs with vmcs.cpu = -1, it can be directly added to cpu's percpu
list. The list can be corrupted if the cpu prefetch the vmcs's list before
reading vmcs->cpu. Meanwhile, we should remove vmcs from the list before
making vmcs->vcpu == -1 be visible
