Revert "x86-64/efi: Use EFI to deal with platform wall clock (again)"

This reverts commit bd52276fa1d4 ("x86-64/efi: Use EFI to deal with
platform wall clock (again)"), and the two supporting commits:

  da5a108d05b4: "x86/kernel: remove tboot 1:1 page table creation code"

  185034e72d59: "x86, efi: 1:1 pagetable mapping for virtual EFI calls")

as they all depend semantically on commit 53b87cf088e2 ("x86, mm:
Include the entire kernel memory map in trampoline_pgd") that got
reverted earlier due to the problems it caused.

This was pointed out by Yinghai Lu, and verified by me on my Macbook Air
that uses EFI.
