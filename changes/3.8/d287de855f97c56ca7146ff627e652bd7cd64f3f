PM / devfreq: Add sysfs node to expose available frequencies

devfreq governors such as ondemand are controlled by a min and
max frequency, while governors like userspace governor allow us
to set a specific frequency.
However, for the same specific device, depending on the SoC, the
available frequencies can vary.

So expose the available frequencies as a snapshot over sysfs to
allow informed decisions.

This was inspired by cpufreq framework's equivalent for similar
usage sysfs node: scaling_available_frequencies.
