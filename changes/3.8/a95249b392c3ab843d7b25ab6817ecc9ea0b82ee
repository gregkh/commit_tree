Btrfs: don't bother copying if we're only logging the inode

We don't copy inode items anwyay, we just copy them straight into the log
from the in memory inode.  So if we know we're only logging the inode, don't
bother dropping anything, just try to insert it and either if it succeeds or
we get EEXIST we can update the inode item in the log and carry on.  Thanks,
