serial: clps711x: Convert all static variables to dynamic

This patch converts all static variables of clps711x serial driver
to dynamic allocating. In this case we are should remove console_initcall()
and declare console during driver registration. Early kernel messages can
be retrieved by add "earlyprintk" option to the kernel command line.
