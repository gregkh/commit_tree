drbd: differentiate early and later "postponing" of requests

We use the RQ_POSTPONED flag to mark a request for several reasons.

It may be a conflicting request in a dual-primary setup,
where conflict detection and resolution on the peer decided that
this request needs to be re-submitted, it needs to re-enter
drbd_make_request() to fix the data divergence caused by these
conflicting, partially overlapping, quasi-simultaneous requests.

In this case we need to mark the corresponding area as out-of-sync,
before we call drbd_al_complete_io().

We also use the RQ_POSTPONED flag to just "push back" a request,
before even processing it, if IO is suspended for some reason.
In this case, as this request was neither submitted nor sent yet,
we must not touch the bitmap.
