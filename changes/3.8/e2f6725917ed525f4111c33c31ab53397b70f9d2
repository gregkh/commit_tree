net/xfrm/xfrm_replay: avoid division by zero

All of the xfrm_replay->advance functions in xfrm_replay.c check if
x->replay_esn->replay_window is zero (and return if so).  However,
one of them, xfrm_replay_advance_bmp(), divides by that value (in the
'%' operator) before doing the check, which can potentially trigger
a divide-by-zero exception.  Some compilers will also assume that the
earlier division means the value cannot be zero later, and thus will
eliminate the subsequent zero check as dead code.

This patch moves the division to after the check.
