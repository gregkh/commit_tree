drbd: get rid of drbd_bcast_ee, it is of no use anymore

This function was used to broadcast the (leading part of the)
bio payload in case we see a data integrity error.  It could be received
from userland with the drbdsetup events subcommand,
to have a peek into the payload that caused the checksum mismatch,
and guess from there what may have caused the mismatch,
mainly to guess wether it was modification of in-flight data,
or data corruption by broken hardware or software bugs.

Meanwhile we support bios that are larger than the maximum payload a
netlink datagram can carry.
And we have means to reliably detect modification of in-flight data by
calculating, and comparing, the checksum before and after sendmsg.
There is no need to carry this around anymore.
