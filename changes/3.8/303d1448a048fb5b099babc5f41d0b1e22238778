drbd: Runtime changeable wire protocol

The wire protocol is no longer a property that is negotiated
between the two peers. It is now expressed with two bits
(DP_SEND_WRITE_ACK and DP_SEND_RECEIVE_ACK) in each data
packet. Therefore the primary node is free to change the
wire protocol at any time without disconnect/reconnect.
