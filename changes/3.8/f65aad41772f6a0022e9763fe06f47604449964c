MIPS: Cavium: Add EDAC support.

Drivers for EDAC on Cavium.  Supported subsystems are:

 o CPU primary caches.  These are parity protected only, so only error
   reporting.
 o Second level cache - ECC protected, provides SECDED.
 o Memory: ECC / SECDEC if used with suitable DRAM modules.  The driver will
   will only initialize if ECC is enabled on a system so is safe to run on
   non-ECC memory.
 o PCI: Parity error reporting

Since it is very hard to test this sort of code the implementation is very
conservative and uses polling where possible for now.
