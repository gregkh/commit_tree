drbd: Remove redundant and wrong test for NULL simplification in conn_connect()

Since the drbd_socket_okay() function itself tests if the the
socket is NULL, the explicit test "if (sock.socket && &msock.socket)"
was redundent.
Apart from that the address opperator ('&') before msock.socket rendered
the test pointless.
