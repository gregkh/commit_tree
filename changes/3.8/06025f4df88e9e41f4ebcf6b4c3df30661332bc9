f2fs: handle error from f2fs_iget_nowait

In case f2fs_iget_nowait returns error, it results in truncate_hole being
called with 'error' value as inode pointer. There is no check in truncate_hole
for valid inode, so it could result in crash due "invalid access to memory".
Avoid this by handling error condition properly.
