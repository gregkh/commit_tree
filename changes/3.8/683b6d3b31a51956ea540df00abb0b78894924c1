cfg80211: pass a channel definition struct

Instead of passing a channel pointer and channel type
to all functions and driver methods, pass a new channel
definition struct. Right now, this struct contains just
the control channel and channel type, but for VHT this
will change.

Also, add a small inline cfg80211_get_chandef_type() so
that drivers don't need to use the _type field of the
new structure all the time, which will change.
