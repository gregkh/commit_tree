ext4: zero out inline data using memset() instead of empty_zero_page

Not all architectures (in particular, sparc64) have empty_zero_page.
So instead of copying from empty_zero_page, use memset to clear the
inline data by signalling to ext4_xattr_set_entry() via a magic
pointer value, EXT4_ZERO_ATTR_VALUE, which is defined by casting -1 to
a pointer.

This fixes a build failure on sparc64, and the memset() should be more
efficient than using memcpy() anyway.
