efivarfs: Implement exclusive access for {get,set}_variable

Currently, efivarfs does not enforce exclusion over the get_variable and
set_variable operations. Section 7.1 of UEFI requires us to only allow a
single processor to enter {get,set}_variable services at once.

This change acquires the efivars->lock over calls to these operations
from the efivarfs paths.
