f2fs: add f2fs_balance_fs in several interfaces

The f2fs_balance_fs() is to check the number of free sections and decide whether
it needs to conduct cleaning or not. If there are not enough free sections, the
cleaning job should be started.

In order to control an amount of free sections even under high utilization, f2fs
should call f2fs_balance_fs at all the VFS interfaces that are able to produce
dirty pages.
This patch adds the function calls in the missing interfaces as follows.

1. f2fs_setxattr()
The f2fs_setxattr() produces dirty node pages so that we should call
f2fs_balance_fs() either likewise doing in other VFS interfaces such as
f2fs_lookup(), f2fs_mkdir(), and so on.

2. f2fs_sync_file()
We should guarantee serving free sections for syncing metadata during fsync.
Previously, there is no space check before triggering checkpoint and
sync_node_pages.
Therefore, if a bunch of fsync calls are triggered under 100% of FS utilization,
f2fs is able to be faced with no free sections, resulting in BUG_ON().

3. f2fs_sync_fs()
Before calling write_checkpoint(), we should guarantee that there are minimum
free sections.

4. f2fs_write_inode()
f2fs_write_inode() is also able to produce dirty node pages.
