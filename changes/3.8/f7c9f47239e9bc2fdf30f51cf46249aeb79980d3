ARM: at91/atmel-mci: remove unused setup_dma_addr() macro

This macro is not used anymove in atmel-mci driver. It has been removed
by a patch that was dealing with dw_dmac.c e2b35f3:
(dmaengine/dw_dmac: Fix dw_dmac user drivers to adapt to slave_config changes)

We are now using the dmaengine API to specify the slave DMA parameters:
dmaengine_slave_config().
