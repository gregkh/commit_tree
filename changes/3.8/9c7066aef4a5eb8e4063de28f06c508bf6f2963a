ALSA: core: fix 64-bit SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_STATUS ABI breakage

Commit 4eeaaeaea (ALSA: core: add hooks for audio timestamps) added the
new audio_tstamp field to struct snd_pcm_status.  However, struct
timespec requires 64-bit alignment, so the 64-bit compiler would insert
32 bits of padding before this field, which broke SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_STATUS
with error messages like this:

  kernel: unknown ioctl = 0x80984120

To solve this, insert the padding explicitly so that it can be taken
into account when calculating the ABI structure size.
