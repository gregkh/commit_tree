ext4: lock i_mutex when truncating orphan inodes

Commit c278531d39 added a warning when ext4_flush_unwritten_io() is
called without i_mutex being taken.  It had previously not been taken
during orphan cleanup since races weren't possible at that point in
the mount process, but as a result of this c278531d39, we will now see
a kernel WARN_ON in this case.  Take the i_mutex in
ext4_orphan_cleanup() to suppress this warning.
