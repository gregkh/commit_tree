nl/cfg80211: force scan using an AP vif if requested

If the user wants to scan using a vif configured as AP,
cfg80211 must give him a chance to do it, even if this
will disrupt the stations performance due to off-channel
scanning. To do so, this patch adds a 'force' flag to the
SCAN_TRIGGER command which tells cfg80211 to perform the
scanning operation even if the vif is an AP and the
beaconing has already started.
