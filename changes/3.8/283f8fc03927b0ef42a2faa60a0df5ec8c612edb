init: reduce PARTUUID min length to 1 from 36

Reduce the minimum length for a root=PARTUUID= parameter to be considered
valid from 36 to 1.  EFI/GPT partition UUIDs are always exactly 36
characters long, hence the previous limit.  However, the next patch will
support DOS/MBR UUIDs too, which have a different, shorter, format.
Instead of validating any particular length, just ensure that at least
some non-empty value was given by the user.

Also, consider a missing UUID value to be a parsing error, in the same
vein as if /PARTNROFF exists and can't be parsed.  As such, make both
error cases print a message and disable rootwait.  Convert to pr_err while
we're at it.
