mfd: tps65910: Pass irq_domain when adding mfd sub devices

When adding the sub device "tps65910-rtc", is it passed the
IO resource IRQ for the interrupt number. This interrupt needs
to map in the device irq domain. Pass the irq domain of device
in mfd_add_devices() so that proper irq mapping can be done when
adding the sub device RTC.
