e1000: fix concurrent accesses to PHY from watchdog and ethtool

The e1000 driver currently does not protect concurrent accesses to the PHY
from both the ethtool callbacks, and from the e1000_watchdog function. This
patchs adds a new spinlock which is used by e1000_{read,write}_phy_reg in
order to serialize concurrent accesses to the PHY.
