console: use might_sleep in console_lock

Instead of BUG_ON(in_interrupt()), since that doesn't check for all
the newfangled stuff like preempt.

Note that this is valid since the console_sem is essentially used like
a real mutex with only two twists:
- we allow trylock from hardirq context
- across suspend/resume we lock the logical console_lock, but drop the
  semaphore protecting the locking state.

Now that doesn't guarantee that no one is playing tricks in
single-thread atomic contexts at suspend/resume/boot time, but
- I couldn't find anything suspicious with some grepping,
- might_sleep shouldn't die,
- and I think the upside of catching more potential issues is worth
  the risk of getting a might_sleep backtrace that would have been
  save (and then dealing with that fallout).
