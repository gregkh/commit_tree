cpufreq / core: Fix printing of governor and driver name

Arrays for governer and driver name are of size CPUFREQ_NAME_LEN or 16.
i.e. 15 bytes for name and 1 for trailing '\0'.

When cpufreq driver print these names (for sysfs), it includes '\n' or ' ' in
the fmt string and still passes length as CPUFREQ_NAME_LEN. If the driver or
governor names are using all 15 fields allocated to them, then the trailing '\n'
or ' ' will never be printed. And so commands like:

root@linaro-developer# cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver

will print something like:

cpufreq_foodrvroot@linaro-developer#

Fix this by increasing print length by one character.
