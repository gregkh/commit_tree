ARM: OMAP2+: onenand: connected soc info in pdata

onenand driver needs to know whether soc is falling under
34xx family to properly handle onenand. But driver is not
supposed to do cpu_is_* check, hence educate platform data
with this information. Driver can make use of it to avoid
cpu_is_* check.
