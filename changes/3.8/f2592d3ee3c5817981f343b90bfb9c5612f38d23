Bluetooth: trivial: Change NO_FCS_RECV to RECV_NO_FCS

Make code more readable by changing CONF_NO_FCS_RECV which is read
as "No L2CAP FCS option received" to CONF_RECV_NO_FCS which means
"Received L2CAP option NO_FCS". This flag really means that we have
received L2CAP FRAME CHECK SEQUENCE (FCS) OPTION with value "No FCS".
