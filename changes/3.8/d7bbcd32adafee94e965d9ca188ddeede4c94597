ixgbe: Add support for pipeline reset

Calling the ixgbe_reset_pipeline_82599 function will ensure a full pipeline
reset on all 82599 devices.  This is necessary to avoid possible link issues.
Since this patch accomplishes this by modifying AUTOC.LMS we need to wrap
all AUTOC writes when LESM is enabled.

v2- fix LMS behaviour based on feedback by Martin Josefsson
