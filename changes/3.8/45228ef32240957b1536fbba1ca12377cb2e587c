clk: ux500: Initial support for abx500 clock driver

The abx500 clock driver is a platform driver which will be initialized
during arch init. The platform device shall be added from the ab-core
driver as a mfd child device to maintain correct boot sequence.

Depending on what ab version we use, different clock definitions will
be added.
