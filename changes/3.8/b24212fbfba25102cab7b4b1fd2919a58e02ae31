arm: mvebu: Use dw-apb-uart instead of ns16650 as UART driver

The UART controller used in the Armada 370 and Armada XP SoCs is the
Synopsys DesignWare 8250 (aka Synopsys DesignWare ABP UART). The
improper use of the ns16550 can lead to a kernel oops during boot if
a character is sent to the UART before the initialization of the
driver. The DW APB has an extra interrupt that gets raised when
writing to the LCR when busy. This explains why we need to use
dw-apb-uart driver to handle this.
