MIPS: BCM47XX: improve memory size detection

The memory size is detected by finding a place where it repeats in
memory. Currently we are just checking when the function prom_init is
seen again, but it is better to check for a bigger part of the memory
to decrease the chance of wrong results.

This should fix a problem we saw in OpenWrt, where the detected
available memory decreed on some devices when doing a soft reboot.
