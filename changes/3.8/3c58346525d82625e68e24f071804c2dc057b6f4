slab: Simplify bootstrap

The nodelists field in kmem_cache is pointing to the first unused
object in the array field when bootstrap is complete.

A problem with the current approach is that the statically sized
kmem_cache structure use on boot can only contain NR_CPUS entries.
If the number of nodes plus the number of cpus is greater then we
would overwrite memory following the kmem_cache_boot definition.

Increase the size of the array field to ensure that also the node
pointers fit into the array field.

Once we do that we no longer need the kmem_cache_nodelists
array and we can then also use that structure elsewhere.
