ARM: OMAP4: USB: power down MUSB PHY during boot

Commit c9e4412ab8eb8ef82d645d8749c4ce96ad490007 removed all of the USB
PHY functions for OMAP4, but this causes a problem with core retention
as the MUSB module remains enabled if omap-usb2 phy driver is not used.
This keeps the USB DPLL enabled and prevents l3_init pwrdm from idling.

Fixed by adding a minimal function back that disables the USB PHY during
boot.
