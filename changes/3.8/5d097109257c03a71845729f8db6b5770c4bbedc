tun: only queue packets on device

Historically tun supported two modes of operation:
- in default mode, a small number of packets would get queued
  at the device, the rest would be queued in qdisc
- in one queue mode, all packets would get queued at the device

This might have made sense up to a point where we made the
queue depth for both modes the same and set it to
a huge value (500) so unless the consumer
is stuck the chance of losing packets is small.

Thus in practice both modes behave the same, but the
default mode has some problems:
- if packets are never consumed, fragments are never orphaned
  which cases a DOS for sender using zero copy transmit
- overrun errors are hard to diagnose: fifo error is incremented
  only once so you can not distinguish between
  userspace that is stuck and a transient failure,
  tcpdump on the device does not show any traffic

Userspace solves this simply by enabling IFF_ONE_QUEUE
but there seems to be little point in not doing the
right thing for everyone, by default.
