drivers/video/ssd1307fb.c: fix bit order bug in the byte translation function

This was leading to a strange behaviour when using the fbcon driver on
top of this one: the letters were in the right order, but each letter
had a vertical symmetry.

This was because the addressing was right for the byte, but the
addressing of each individual bit was inverted.
