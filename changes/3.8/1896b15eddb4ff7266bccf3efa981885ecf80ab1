ahci_platform: perform platform exit in host_stop() hook

AHCI platform devices may provide an exit() routine, via
ahci_platform_data, that powers off the SATA core. Such a routine should
be executed from the ata_port_operations host_stop() hook. That way, the
ATA subsystem can perform any last-minute hardware cleanup (via devres,
for example), then trigger the power-off at the appropriate time.

This patch fixes bus errors triggered during module removal or device
unbinding, seen on an SoC SATA core.
