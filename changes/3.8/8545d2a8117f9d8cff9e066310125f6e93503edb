staging: comedi: cb_pcidda: remove the private data 'status'

This variable in the private data is only used to output some
kernel noise during the attach about certian board types not
being fully tested.

All of the boards supported by this driver share a common register
map and should be compatible. Just remove the 'status' and the
noise.
