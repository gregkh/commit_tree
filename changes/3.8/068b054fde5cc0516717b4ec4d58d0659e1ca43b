USB: OHCI: sm501: fix build failure after ohci_finish_controller_resume removal

Commit cfa49b4b (USB: ohci: merge ohci_finish_controller_resume with
ohci_resume) merged ohci_finish_controller_resume with ohci_resume but forgot
to update the ohci-sm501 driver accordingly, thus causing the folllowing build
failure:

drivers/usb/host/ohci-sm501.c: In function 'ohci_sm501_resume':
drivers/usb/host/ohci-sm501.c:241:2: error: implicit declaration of function
'ohci_finish_controller_resume' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
