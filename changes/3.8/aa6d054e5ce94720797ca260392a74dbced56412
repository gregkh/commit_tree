userns: Add a more complete capability subset test to commit_creds

When unsharing a user namespace we reduce our credentials to just what
can be done in that user namespace.  This is a subset of the credentials
we previously had.  Teach commit_creds to recognize this is a subset
of the credentials we have had before and don't clear the dumpability flag.

This allows an unprivileged  program to do:
unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER);
fd = open("/proc/self/uid_map", O_RDWR);

Where previously opening the uid_map writable would fail because
the the task had been made non-dumpable.
