drm/exynos: fimd: modify condition in fimd resume

If fimd is runtime suspended (by DPMS OFF), fimd_suspend does not
call fimd_activate(false) and just returns. Similarily the check in
fimd_resume should not resume if previously runtime_suspended.
Instead the existing check does the opposite. So if fimd was not
runtime suspended, suspend will turn off fimd but resume will not turn
it on.  This patch fixes this issue by reversing the condition.
