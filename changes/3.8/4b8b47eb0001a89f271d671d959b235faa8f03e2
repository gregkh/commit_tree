cgroup: update cgroup_create() failure path

cgroup_create() was ignoring failure of cgroupfs files.  Update it
such that, if file creation fails, it rolls back by calling
cgroup_destroy_locked() and returns failure.

Note that error out goto labels are renamed.  The labels are a bit
confusing but will become better w/ later cgroup operation renames.
