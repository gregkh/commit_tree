tracing: Fix regression of trace_options file setting

The latest change to allow trace options to be set on the command
line also broke the trace_options file.

The zeroing of the last byte of the option name that is echoed into
the trace_option file was removed with the consolidation of some
of the code. The compare between the option and what was written to
the trace_options file fails because the string holding the data
written doesn't terminate with a null character.

A zero needs to be added to the end of the string copied from
user space.
