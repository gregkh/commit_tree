gpiolib: iron out include ladder mistakes

The <*/gpio.h> includes are updated again: now we need to account
for the problem introduced by commit:
595679a8038584df7b9398bf34f61db3c038bfea
"gpiolib: fix up function prototypes etc"

Actually we need static inlines in include/asm-generic/gpio.h
as well since we may have GPIOLIB but not PINCTRL.
Make sure to move all the CONFIG_PINCTRL business
to the end of the file so we are sure we have
declared struct gpio_chip.

And we need to keep the static inlines in <linux/gpio.h>
but here for the !CONFIG_GENERIC_GPIO case, and then we
may as well throw in a few warnings like the other
prototypes there, if someone would have the bad taste
of compiling without GENERIC_GPIO even.
