Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for stLocalSFAddIndicationAlt and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for
stLocalSFAddIndicationAlt, changes the
name of the struct to bcm_add_indication_alt,
and removes a comment. In addition, any
calls to typedef stLocalSFAddIndicationAlt
are changed to call the struct directly.
