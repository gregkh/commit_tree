ALSA: hda - Fix non-snoop page handling

For non-snoop mode, we fiddle with the page attributes of CORB/RIRB
and the position buffer, but also the ring buffers.  The problem is
that the current code blindly assumes that the buffer is contiguous.
However, the ring buffers may be SG-buffers, thus a wrong vmapped
address is passed there, leading to Oops.

This patch fixes the handling for SG-buffers.
