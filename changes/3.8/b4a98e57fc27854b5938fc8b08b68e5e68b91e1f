drm/i915: Flush outstanding unpin tasks before pageflipping

If we accumulate unpin tasks because we are pageflipping faster than the
system can schedule its workers, we can effectively create a
pin-leak. The solution taken here is to limit the number of unpin tasks
we have per-crtc and to flush those outstanding tasks if we accumulate
too many. This should prevent any jitter in the normal case, and also
prevent the hang if we should run too fast.

Note: It is important that we switch from the system workqueue to our
own dev_priv->wq since all work items on that queue are guaranteed to
only need the dev->struct_mutex and not any modeset resources. For
otherwise if we have a work item ahead in the queue which needs the
modeset lock (like the output detect work used by both polling or
hpd), this work and so the unpin work will never execute since the
pageflip code already holds that lock. Unfortunately there's no
lockdep support for this scenario in the workqueue code.
