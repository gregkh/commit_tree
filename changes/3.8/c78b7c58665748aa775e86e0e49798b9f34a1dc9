net: cdc_ncm: refactoring for tx multiplexing

Adding multiplexed NDP support to cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame, allowing
transmissions of multiple independent sessions within the same NTB.

Refactoring the code quite a bit to avoid having to store copies
of multiple NDPs being prepared for tx. The old code would still
reserve enough room for a maximum sized NDP in the skb so we might
as well keep them in the skb while they are being prepared.
