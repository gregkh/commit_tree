powerpc/oprofile: Fix error in oprofile power7_marked_instr_event() function

The calculation for the left shift of the mask OPROFILE_PM_PMCSEL_MSK has an
error.  The calculation is should be to shift left by (max_cntrs - cntr) times
the width of the pmsel field width.  However, the #define OPROFILE_MAX_PMC_NUM
was used instead of OPROFILE_PMSEL_FIELD_WIDTH.  This patch fixes the
calculation.
