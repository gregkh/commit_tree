net: Allow userns root control of the core of the network stack.

Allow an unpriviled user who has created a user namespace, and then
created a network namespace to effectively use the new network
namespace, by reducing capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) and
capable(CAP_NET_RAW) calls to be ns_capable(net->user_ns,
CAP_NET_ADMIN), or capable(net->user_ns, CAP_NET_RAW) calls.

Settings that merely control a single network device are allowed.
Either the network device is a logical network device where
restrictions make no difference or the network device is hardware NIC
that has been explicity moved from the initial network namespace.

In general policy and network stack state changes are allowed
while resource control is left unchanged.

Allow ethtool ioctls.

Allow binding to network devices.
Allow setting the socket mark.
Allow setting the socket priority.

Allow setting the network device alias via sysfs.
Allow setting the mtu via sysfs.
Allow changing the network device flags via sysfs.
Allow setting the network device group via sysfs.

Allow the following network device ioctls.
