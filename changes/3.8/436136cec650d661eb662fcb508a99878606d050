HID: add quirk for Freescale i.MX23 ROM recovery

The USB recovery mode present in i.MX23 ROM emulates USB HID.  It needs this
quirk to behave properly.

Even if the official branding of the chip is Freescale i.MX23, I named it
Sigmatel STMP3780 since that's what the chip really is and it even reports
itself as STMP3780.
