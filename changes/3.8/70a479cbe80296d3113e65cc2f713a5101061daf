x86, efi: Fix display detection in EFI boot stub

When booting under OVMF we have precisely one GOP device, and it
implements the ConOut protocol.

We break out of the loop when we look at it... and then promptly abort
because 'first_gop' never gets set. We should set first_gop *before*
breaking out of the loop. Yes, it doesn't really mean "first" any more,
but that doesn't matter. It's only a flag to indicate that a suitable
GOP was found.

In fact, we'd do just as well to initialise 'width' to zero in this
function, then just check *that* instead of first_gop. But I'll do the
minimal fix for now (and for stable@).
