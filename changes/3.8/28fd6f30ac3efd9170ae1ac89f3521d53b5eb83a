cgroup: open-code cgroup_create_dir()

The operation order of cgroup creation is about to change and
cgroup_create_dir() is more of a hindrance than a proper abstraction.
Open-code it by moving the parent nlink adjustment next to self nlink
adjustment in cgroup_create_file() and the rest to cgroup_create().

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior change.
