perf tools: Don't try to lookup objdump for live mode

Arnaldo reported that annotation during perf top resulted in a segfault.
It was because the env->arch was NULL and we don't set it for a live
session.  In fact, no need to look up objdump in this case since we can
use system's default (native) objdump.
