aoe: support the forgetting (flushing) of a user-specified AoE target

Users sometimes want to cause the aoe driver to forget a particular
previously discovered device when it is no longer online.  The aoetools
provide an "aoe-flush" command that users run to perform this
administrative task.  The changes below provide the support needed in the
driver.
