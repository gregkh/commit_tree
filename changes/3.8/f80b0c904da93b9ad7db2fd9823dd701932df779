Ensure that kernel_init_freeable() is not inlined into non __init code

Commit d6b2123802d "make sure that we always have a return path from
kernel_execve()" reshuffled kernel_init()/init_post() to ensure that
kernel_execve() has a caller to return to.

It removed __init annotation for kernel_init() and introduced/calls a
new routine kernel_init_freeable(). Latter however is inlined by any
reasonable compiler (ARC gcc 4.4 in this case), causing slight code
bloat.

This patch forces kernel_init_freeable() as noinline reducing the .text
