ACPI, APEI: Fixup incorrect 64-bit access width firmware bug

The bit width check was introduced by 15afae60 (ACPI, APEI: Fix
incorrect APEI register bit width check and usage), and a fixup
for incorrect 32-bit width memory address was given by f712c71
(ACPI, APEI: Fixup common access width firmware bug). Now there
is a similar symptom:

[Firmware Bug]: APEI: Invalid bit width + offset in GAR [0x12345000/64/0/3/0]

Another bogus BIOS reports an incorrect 64-bit width in trigger table.
Thus, apply to a similar workaround for 64-bit width memory address.
