drbd: Fix a potential issue with the DISCARD_CONCURRENT flag

The DISCARD_CONCURRENT flag should be set on one node and cleared on the
other node.
As the code was before it was theoretical possible that a node accepts the
meta socket, but has to close it later on, and keeps the DISCARD_CONCURRENT
flag.
Correct this by moving the clear_bit(DISCARD_CONCURRENT) where the packet
gets sent.
