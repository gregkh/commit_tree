drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c: restore ST variant functionality

Commit e7e034e18a0a ("drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c: fix the missing operation
on enable") accidentally broke the ST variants of PL031.

The bit that is being poked as "clockwatch" enable bit for the ST
variants does the work of bit 0 on this variant.  Bit 0 is used for a
clock divider on the ST variants, and setting it to 1 will affect
timekeeping in a very bad way.
