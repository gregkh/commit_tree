tracing: Make tracing_enabled be equal to tracing_on

The tracing_enabled file has been deprecated as it never was able
to serve its purpose well. The tracing_on file has taken over.
Instead of having code to keep tracing_enabled, have the tracing_enabled
file just set tracing_on, and remove the tracing_enabled variable.

This allows us to remove the tracing_enabled file. The reason that
the remove is in a different change set and not removed here is
in case we find some lonely userspace tool that requires the file
to exist. Then the removal patch will get reverted, but this one
will not.
