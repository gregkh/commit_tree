ACPI / PM: Provide ACPI PM callback routines for subsystems

Some bus types don't support power management natively, but generally
there may be device nodes in ACPI tables corresponding to the devices
whose bus types they are (under ACPI 5 those bus types may be SPI,
I2C and platform).  If that is the case, standard ACPI power
management may be applied to those devices, although currently the
kernel has no means for that.

For this reason, provide a set of routines that may be used as power
management callbacks for such devices.  This may be done in three
different ways.

 (1) Device drivers handling the devices in question may run
     acpi_dev_pm_attach() in their .probe() routines, which (on
     success) will cause the devices to be added to the general ACPI
     PM domain and ACPI power management will be used for them going
     forward.  Then, acpi_dev_pm_detach() may be used to remove the
     devices from the general ACPI PM domain if ACPI power management
     is not necessary for them any more.

 (2) The devices' subsystems may use acpi_subsys_runtime_suspend(),
     acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), acpi_subsys_prepare(),
     acpi_subsys_suspend_late(), acpi_subsys_resume_early() as their
     power management callbacks in the same way as the general ACPI
     PM domain does that.

 (3) The devices' drivers may execute acpi_dev_suspend_late(),
     acpi_dev_resume_early(), acpi_dev_runtime_suspend(),
     acpi_dev_runtime_resume() from their power management callbacks
     as appropriate, if that's absolutely necessary, but it is not
     recommended to do that, because such drivers may not work
     without ACPI support as a result.
