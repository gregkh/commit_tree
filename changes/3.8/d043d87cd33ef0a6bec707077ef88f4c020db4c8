ARM: OMAP2+: clockdomain: bypass clockdomain handling when disabling unused clks

The OMAP port to the common clk framework[1] resulted in spurious WARNs
while disable unused clocks.  This is due to _clkdm_clk_hwmod_disable
catching clkdm->usecount's with a value of zero.  Even less desirable it
would not allow the clkdm_clk_disable function pointer to get called due
to an early return of -ERANGE.

This patch adds a check for such a corner case by skipping the WARN and
early return in the event that clkdm->usecount and clk->enable_usecount
are both zero.  Presumably this could only happen during the check for
unused clocks at boot-time.

[paul@pwsan.com: split the hwmod and clock disable cases; modified the
 code to skip the clockdomain handling during the disable-unused-clocks phase;
 added COMMON_CLK ifdef; removed include of clk-private.h at Mike's request]
