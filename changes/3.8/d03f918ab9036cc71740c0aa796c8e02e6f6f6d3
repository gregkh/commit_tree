Btrfs: Don't trust the superblock label and simply printk("%s") it

Someone who is root or capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) could corrupt the
superblock and make Btrfs printk("%s") crash while holding the
uuid_mutex since nobody forces a limit on the string. Since the
uuid_mutex is significant, the system would be unusable
afterwards.
