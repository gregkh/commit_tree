cgroup_rm_file: don't delete the uncreated files

in cgroup_add_file,when creating files for cgroup,
some of creation may be skipped. So we need to avoid
deleting these uncreated files in cgroup_rm_file,
otherwise the warning msg will be triggered.

"cgroup_addrm_files: failed to remove memory_pressure_enabled, err=-2"
