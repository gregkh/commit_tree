[SCSI] sd: Use SCSI read/write(16) with > 32-bit LBA drives

Force large capacity (> 0xFFFFFFFF blocks) drives to use READ/WRITE(16) instead
of READ/WRITE(10). Some(most/all?) USB enclosures do not like READ(10) commands
when a large capacity drive is installed. This issue was reported and discussed
here: http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=135247705222324
