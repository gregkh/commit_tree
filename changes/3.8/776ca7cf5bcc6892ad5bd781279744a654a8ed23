drm/i915: Apply the IBX transcoder A w/a for HDMI to SDVO as well

As the SDVO/HDMI registers are multiplex, it is safe to assume that the
w/a required for HDMI on IbexPoint, namely that the SDVO register cannot
both be disabled and have selected transcoder B, is also required for
SDVO. At least the modeset state checker detects that the transcoder
selection is left in the undefined state, and so it appears sensible to
apply the w/a:

[ 1814.480054] IBX PCH hdmi port still using transcoder B
