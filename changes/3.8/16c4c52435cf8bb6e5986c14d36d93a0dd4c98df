bindings: i2c: use consistent naming for i2c binding descriptions

Filenames of devictree binding documentation seems to be arbitrary and
for me it is unneeded hazzle to find the corresponding documentation for
a specific driver.

Naming the description the same as the driver is a lot easier and makes
sense to me since the driver defines the binding it understands.

Also, remove a reference in one source to the binding documentation, since path
information easily gets stale.
