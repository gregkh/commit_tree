mm: augment vma rbtree with rb_subtree_gap

Define vma->rb_subtree_gap as the largest gap between any vma in the
subtree rooted at that vma, and their predecessor.  Or, for a recursive
definition, vma->rb_subtree_gap is the max of:

 - vma->vm_start - vma->vm_prev->vm_end
 - rb_subtree_gap fields of the vmas pointed by vma->rb.rb_left and
   vma->rb.rb_right

This will allow get_unmapped_area_* to find a free area of the right
size in O(log(N)) time, instead of potentially having to do a linear
walk across all the VMAs.

Also define mm->highest_vm_end as the vm_end field of the highest vma,
so that we can easily check if the following gap is suitable.

This does have the potential to make unmapping VMAs more expensive,
especially for processes with very large numbers of VMAs, where the VMA
rbtree can grow quite deep.
