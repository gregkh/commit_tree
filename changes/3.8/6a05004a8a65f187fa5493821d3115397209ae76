igb: Split igb_update_dca into separate Tx and Rx functions

This change makes it so that igb_update_dca is broken into two halves, one
for Rx and one for Tx.  The advantage to this is primarily readability.

In addition I am enabling relaxed ordering for reads from hardware since
this is supported on all of the igb parts.
