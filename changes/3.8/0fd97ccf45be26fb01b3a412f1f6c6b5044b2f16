target: kill struct se_subsystem_dev

Simplify the code a lot by killing the superflous struct se_subsystem_dev.
Instead se_device is allocated early on by the backend driver, which allocates
it as part of its own per-device structure, borrowing the scheme that is for
example used for inode allocation.
