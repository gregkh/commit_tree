rbd: rename snap_exists field

A Boolean field "snap_exists" in an rbd mapping is used to indicate
whether a mapped snapshot has been removed from an image's snapshot
context, to stop sending requests for that snapshot as soon as we
know it's gone.

Generalize the interpretation of this field so it applies to
non-snapshot (i.e. "head") mappings.  That is, define its value
to be false until the mapping has been set, and then define it to be
true for both snapshot mappings or head mappings.

Rename the field "exists" to reflect the broader interpretation.
The rbd_mapping structure is on its way out, so move the field
back into the rbd_device structure.
