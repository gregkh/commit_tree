i2c / ACPI: add ACPI enumeration support

ACPI 5 introduced I2cSerialBus resource that makes it possible to enumerate
and configure the I2C slave devices behind the I2C controller. This patch
adds helper functions to support I2C slave enumeration.

An ACPI enabled I2C controller driver only needs to call acpi_i2c_register_devices()
in order to get its slave devices enumerated, created and bound to the
corresponding ACPI handle.
