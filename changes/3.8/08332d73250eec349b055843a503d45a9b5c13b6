drbd: properly call drbd_rs_cancel_all() in drbd_disconnected()

drbd_disconnected() is supposed to clear the resync lru cache,
by calling drbd_rs_cancel_all().

We must do so before we call drbd_flush_workqueue(), as at least the
callback w_restart_disk_io() may wait for resync progres, and would
otherwise deadlock.

drbd_finish_peer_reqs() may again populate that cache, which will
then potentially be stale after the next resync handshake and bitmap
exchange, we have to do it again after that.

A stale resync lru cache causes no harm but ugly messages like this:
 BAD! sector=196608s enr=6 rs_left=-256 rs_failed=0 count=256 cstate=SyncTarget
