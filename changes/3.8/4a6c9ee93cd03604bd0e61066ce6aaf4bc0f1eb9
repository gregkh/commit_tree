aoe: allow comma separator in aoe_iflist value

By default, the aoe driver uses any ethernet interface for AoE, but the
aoe_iflist module parameter provides a convenient way to limit AoE
traffic to a specific list of local network interfaces.

This change allows a list to be specified using the comma character as a
separator.  For example,

  modprobe aoe aoe_iflist=eth2,eth3

Before, it was inconvenient to get the quoting right in shell scripts
when setting aoe_iflist to have more than one network interface.
