tracing: Fix regression of trace_pipe

Commit 0fb9656d "tracing: Make tracing_enabled be equal to tracing_on"
changes the behaviour of trace_pipe, ie. it makes trace_pipe return if
we've read something and tracing is enabled, and this means that we have
to 'cat trace_pipe' again and again while running tests.

IMO the right way is if tracing is enabled, we always block and wait for
ring buffer, or we may lose what we want since ring buffer's size is limited.
