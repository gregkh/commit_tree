be2net: fix INTx ISR for interrupt behaviour on BE2

On BE2 chip, an interrupt may be raised even when EQ is in un-armed state.
As a result be_intx()::events_get() and be_poll:events_get() can race and
notify an EQ wrongly.

Fix this by counting events only in be_poll(). Commit 0b545a629 fixes
the same issue in the MSI-x path.

But, on Lancer, INTx can be de-asserted only by notifying num evts. This
is not an issue as the above BE2 behavior doesn't exist/has never been
seen on Lancer.
