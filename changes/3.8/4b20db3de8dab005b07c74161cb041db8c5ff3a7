kref: Implement kref_get_unless_zero v3

This function is intended to simplify locking around refcounting for
objects that can be looked up from a lookup structure, and which are
removed from that lookup structure in the object destructor.
Operations on such objects require at least a read lock around
lookup + kref_get, and a write lock around kref_put + remove from lookup
structure. Furthermore, RCU implementations become extremely tricky.
With a lookup followed by a kref_get_unless_zero *with return value check*
locking in the kref_put path can be deferred to the actual removal from
the lookup structure and RCU lookups become trivial.

v2: Formatting fixes.
v3: Invert the return value.
