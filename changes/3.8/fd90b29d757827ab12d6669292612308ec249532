tcp: change default tcp hash size

As time passed, available memory increased faster than number of
concurrent tcp sockets.

As a result, a machine with 4GB of ram gets a hash table
with 524288 slots, using 8388608 bytes of memory.

Lets change that by a 16x factor (one slot for 128 KB of ram)

Even if a small machine needs a _lot_ of sockets, tcp lookups are now
very efficient, using one cache line per socket.
