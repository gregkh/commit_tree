Bluetooth: Add logical link confirm

The logical link confirm callback is executed when the AMP controller
completes its logical link setup.  During a channel move, a newly
formed logical link allows a move responder to send a move channel
response.  A move initiator will send a move channel confirm.  A
failed logical link will end the channel move and send an appropriate
response or confirm command indicating a failure.

If the channel is being created on an AMP controller, L2CAP
configuration is completed after the logical link is set up.
