bridge: bridge port parameters over netlink

Expose bridge port parameter over netlink. By switching to a nested
message, this can be used for other bridge parameters.

This changes IFLA_PROTINFO attribute from one byte to a full nested
set of attributes. This is safe for application interface because the
old message used IFLA_PROTINFO and new one uses
 IFLA_PROTINFO | NLA_F_NESTED.

The code adapts to old format requests, and therefore stays
compatible with user mode RSTP daemon. Since the type field
for nested and unnested attributes are different, and the old
code in libnetlink doesn't do the mask, it is also safe to use
with old versions of bridge monitor command.

Note: although mode is only a boolean, treating it as a
full byte since in the future someone will probably want to add more
values (like macvlan has).
