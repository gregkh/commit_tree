xfs: fix stray dquot unlock when reclaiming dquots

When we fail to get a dquot lock during reclaim, we jump to an error
handler that unlocks the dquot. This is wrong as we didn't lock the
dquot, and unlocking it means who-ever is holding the lock has had
it silently taken away, and hence it results in a lock imbalance.

Found by inspection while modifying the code for the numa-lru
patchset. This fixes a random hang I've been seeing on xfstest 232
for the past several months.
