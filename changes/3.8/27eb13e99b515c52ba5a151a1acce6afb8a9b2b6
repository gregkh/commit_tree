drbd: Fixed processing of disk-barrier, disk-flushes and disk-drain

Since drbd_bump_write_ordering() is called in the attaching
process while the disk state is D_ATTACHING, it was not
considering these three flags during attach.

A call to this function was missing form drbd_adm_disk_opts().

Fixed both issues.
