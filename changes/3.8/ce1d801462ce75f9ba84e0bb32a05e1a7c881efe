s390/qdio: rework BUG's and WARN_ON's

Remove or replace BUG/BUG_ON where possible and convert WARN_ON
to WARN_ON_ONCE if they can occur freqeuently as pointed out by:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/27/461

Checks have been removed if:
- the error condition leads to a hardware error which gets logged
  and in most cases stops the device
- the error condition is a null pointer access
- the error condition is just pointless or already handled at
  another location
