efi: Add support for a UEFI variable filesystem

The existing EFI variables code only supports variables of up to 1024
bytes. This limitation existed in version 0.99 of the EFI specification,
but was removed before any full releases. Since variables can now be
larger than a single page, sysfs isn't the best interface for this. So,
instead, let's add a filesystem. Variables can be read, written and
created, with the first 4 bytes of each variable representing its UEFI
attributes. The create() method doesn't actually commit to flash since
zero-length variables can't exist per-spec.
