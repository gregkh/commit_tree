clk: make ICST driver handle the VCO registers

It turns out that all platforms using the ICST VCO are really
just touching two registers, and in the same way as well: one
register with the VCO configuration as such, and one lock register
that makes it possible to write to the VCO.

Factor this register read/write into the ICST driver so we can
reuse it in the IM-PD1 driver.
