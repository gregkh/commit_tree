cgroup: s/CGRP_CLONE_CHILDREN/CGRP_CPUSET_CLONE_CHILDREN/

clone_children is only meaningful for cpuset and will stay that way.
Rename the flag to reflect that and update documentation.  Also, drop
clone_children() wrapper in cgroup.c.  The thin wrapper is used only a
few times and one of them will go away soon.
