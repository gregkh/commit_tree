Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _FLASH2X_COPY_SECTION and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _FLASH2X_COPY_SECTION,
and changes the name of the struct to
bcm_flash2x_copy_section. In addition, any calls to
typedefs FLASH2X_COPY_SECTION, or *PFLASH2X_COPY_SECTION
are changed to call the struct directly.
