smsc95xx: fix smsc_crc return type

This patch fixes a bug introduced in bbd9f9e which could prevent
some wakeups from working correctly if multiple wol options were
selected.

This helper function calculates a 16-bit crc and shifts it into
either the high or low 16 bits of a u32 so the caller can or it
directly into place.  The function previously had a u16 return
type so would always have returned zero when filter was odd.
