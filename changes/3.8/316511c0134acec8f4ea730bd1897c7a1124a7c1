gpiolib: rename pin range arguments

To be crystal clear on what the arguments mean in this
funtion dealing with both GPIO and PIN ranges with confusing
naming, we now have gpio_offset and pin_offset and we are
on the clear that these are offsets into the specific GPIO
and pin controller respectively. The GPIO chip itself will
of course keep track of the base offset into the global
GPIO number space.
