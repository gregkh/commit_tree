ARM: 7582/2: rename kvm_seq to vmalloc_seq so to avoid confusion with KVM

The kvm_seq value has nothing to do what so ever with this other KVM.
Given that KVM support on ARM is imminent, it's best to rename kvm_seq
into something else to clearly identify what it is about i.e. a sequence
number for vmalloc section mappings.
