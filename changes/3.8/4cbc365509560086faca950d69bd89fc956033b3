ASoC: wm5102: Register DSP1 Aux widgets

It seems WM_ADSP2("DSP1", 0) is added twice to the widgets list, remove
that and in place use ARIZONA_DSP_WIDGETS(DSP1, "DSP1").

We need to make sure that the DSP1 Aux widgets are provided otherwise
we'll see errors such as "Failed to add route DSP1 Aux 1 -> DSP1" etc.
