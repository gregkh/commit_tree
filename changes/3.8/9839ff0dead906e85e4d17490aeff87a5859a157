sctp: set association state to established in dupcook_a handler

While sctp handling a duplicate COOKIE-ECHO and the action is
'Association restart', sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a() will processing
the unexpected COOKIE-ECHO for peer restart, but it does not set
the association state to SCTP_STATE_ESTABLISHED, so the association
could stuck in SCTP_STATE_SHUTDOWN_PENDING state forever.
This violates the sctp specification:
  RFC 4960 5.2.4. Handle a COOKIE ECHO when a TCB Exists
  Action
  A) In this case, the peer may have restarted. .....
     After this, the endpoint shall enter the ESTABLISHED state.

To resolve this problem, adding a SCTP_CMD_NEW_STATE cmd to the
command list before SCTP_CMD_REPLY cmd, this will set the restart
association to SCTP_STATE_ESTABLISHED state properly and also avoid
I-bit being set in the DATA chunk header when COOKIE_ACK is bundled
with DATA chunks.
