ACPI / thermal: _TMP and _CRT/_HOT/_PSV/_ACx dependency fix

On some platforms, _TMP and _CRT/_HOT/_PSV/_ACx have dependency.
And there is no way for OS to detect this dependency.

commit 9bcb8118965ab4631a65ee0726e6518f75cda6c5 shows us a problem
that _TMP must be evaluate after _CRT/_HOT/_PSV/_ACx, or else
firmware will shutdown the system.

But the machine in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43284
shows us that _PSV would return valid value only if _TMP has been
evaluated once.

With this patch, all of the control methods will be evaluated once,
in the _CRT/_HOT/_PSV/_CRT/_TMP order, before they are actually used.

[rjw: Added a local variable for the handle and modified the loop
 slightly.]
