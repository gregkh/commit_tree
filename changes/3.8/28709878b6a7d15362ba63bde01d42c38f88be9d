batman-adv: wait multiple periods before activating bla

For some reasons (bridge forward delay, network device setup order, etc)
the initial bridge loop avoidance announcement packets may be lost. This
may lead to problems in finding other backbone gws, and therfore create
loops in the startup time.

Fix this by extending the waiting periods to 3 (define can be changed)
before allowing broadcast traffic.
