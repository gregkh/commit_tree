PM / QoS: Introduce PM QoS device flags support

Modify the device PM QoS core code to support PM QoS flags requests.

First, add a new field of type struct pm_qos_flags called "flags"
to struct dev_pm_qos for representing the list of PM QoS flags
requests for the given device.  Accordingly, add a new "type" field
to struct dev_pm_qos_request (along with an enum for representing
request types) and a new member called "flr" to its data union for
representig flags requests.

Second, modify dev_pm_qos_add_request(), dev_pm_qos_update_request(),
the internal routine apply_constraint() used by them and their
existing callers to cover flags requests as well as latency
requests.  In particular, dev_pm_qos_add_request() gets a new
argument called "type" for specifying the type of a request to be
added.

Finally, introduce two routines, __dev_pm_qos_flags() and
dev_pm_qos_flags(), allowing their callers to check which PM QoS
flags have been requested for the given device (the caller is
supposed to pass the mask of flags to check as the routine's
second argument and examine its return value for the result).
