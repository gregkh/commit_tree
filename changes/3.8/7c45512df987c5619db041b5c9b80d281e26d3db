mm: fix pageblock bitmap allocation

Commit c060f943d092 ("mm: use aligned zone start for pfn_to_bitidx
calculation") fixed out calculation of the index into the pageblock
bitmap when a !SPARSEMEM zome was not aligned to pageblock_nr_pages.

However, the _allocation_ of that bitmap had never taken this alignment
requirement into accout, so depending on the exact size and alignment of
the zone, the use of that index could then access past the allocation,
resulting in some very subtle memory corruption.

This was reported (and bisected) by Ingo Molnar: one of his random
config builds would hang with certain very specific kernel command line
options.

In the meantime, commit c060f943d092 has been marked for stable, so this
fix needs to be back-ported to the stable kernels that backported the
commit to use the right alignment.
