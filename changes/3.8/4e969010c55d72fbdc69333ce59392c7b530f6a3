ARM: OMAP1: Remove relative includes

As discussed on linux-arm-kernel, we want to avoid
relative includes for the arch/arm/*omap* code:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg80520.html

Note that eventually when the omap1 specific drivers
are fixed to not use cpu_is_omap macros and not depend
on mach/hardware.h, this patch can be reverted and these
headers can be local. But since just fixing the drivers for
omap2+ is already a big enough hassle, let's deal
with that properly first.
