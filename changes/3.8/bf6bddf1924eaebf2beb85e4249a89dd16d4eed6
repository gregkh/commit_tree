mm: introduce compaction and migration for ballooned pages

Memory fragmentation introduced by ballooning might reduce significantly
the number of 2MB contiguous memory blocks that can be used within a guest,
thus imposing performance penalties associated with the reduced number of
transparent huge pages that could be used by the guest workload.

This patch introduces the helper functions as well as the necessary changes
to teach compaction and migration bits how to cope with pages which are
part of a guest memory balloon, in order to make them movable by memory
compaction procedures.
