userns: For /proc/self/{uid,gid}_map derive the lower userns from the struct file

To keep things sane in the context of file descriptor passing derive the
user namespace that uids are mapped into from the opener of the file
instead of from current.

When writing to the maps file the lower user namespace must always
be the parent user namespace, or setting the mapping simply does
not make sense.  Enforce that the opener of the file was in
the parent user namespace or the user namespace whose mapping
is being set.
