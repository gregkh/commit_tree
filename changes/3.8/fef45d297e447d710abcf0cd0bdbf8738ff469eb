drbd: Write all pages of the bitmap after an online resize

We need to write the whole bitmap after we moved the meta data
due to an online resize operation.

With the support for one peta byte devices bitmap IO was optimized
to only write out touched pages. This optimization must be turned
off when writing the bitmap after an online resize.

This issue was introduced with drbd-8.3.10.

The impact of this bug is that after an online resize, the next
resync could become larger than expected.
