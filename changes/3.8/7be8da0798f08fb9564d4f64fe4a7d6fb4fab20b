drbd: Improve how conflicting writes are handled

The previous algorithm for dealing with overlapping concurrent writes
was generating unnecessary warnings for scenarios which could be
legitimate, and did not always handle partially overlapping requests
correctly.  Improve it algorithm as follows:

* While local or remote write requests are in progress, conflicting new
  local write requests will be delayed (commit 82172f7).

* When a conflict between a local and remote write request is detected,
  the node with the discard flag decides how to resolve the conflict: It
  will ask its peer to discard conflicting requests which are fully
  contained in the local request and retry requests which overlap only
  partially.  This involves a protocol change.
