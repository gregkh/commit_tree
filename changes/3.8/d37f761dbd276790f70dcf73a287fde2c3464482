cputime: Consolidate cputime adjustment code

task_cputime_adjusted() and thread_group_cputime_adjusted()
essentially share the same code. They just don't use the same
source:

* The first function uses the cputime in the task struct and the
previous adjusted snapshot that ensures monotonicity.

* The second adds the cputime of all tasks in the group and the
previous adjusted snapshot of the whole group from the signal
structure.

Just consolidate the common code that does the adjustment. These
functions just need to fetch the values from the appropriate
source.
