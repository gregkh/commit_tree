memcg: make it possible to use the stock for more than one page

We currently have a percpu stock cache scheme that charges one page at a
time from memcg->res, the user counter.  When the kernel memory controller
comes into play, we'll need to charge more than that.

This is because kernel memory allocations will also draw from the user
counter, and can be bigger than a single page, as it is the case with the
stack (usually 2 pages) or some higher order slabs.
