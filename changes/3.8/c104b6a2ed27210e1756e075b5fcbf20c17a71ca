ARM i.MX dtsi: Add default bus-width property for esdhc controller

According to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt bus-width
is a mandatory property. While this is currently enforced nowhere, it's
a good habit to just add the property now to allow to add common helper
functionality for the mmc property parsing later.
