ARM: 7605/1: vmlinux.lds: Move .notes section next to the rodata

The .notes, being read-only data by nature, were placed between
read-write .data and .bss. This was harmful in case of the XIP
kernel, as being placed in the RAM range, most likely far
from the ROM address, was inflating the XIP images.

Moving the .notes at the end of the read-only section
(consisting of .text, .rodata and unwind info) fixes the problem.
