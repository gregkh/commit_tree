The following commit breaks IPv6 TCP transmission for me:

	ipv6: Preserve ipv6 functionality needed by NET

This patch fixes the typo "ipv6_offload" which should be
"ipv6-offload".

I don't know why not including the offload modules should
break TCP. Disabling all offload options on the NIC didn't
help. Outgoing pulseaudio traffic kept stalling.
