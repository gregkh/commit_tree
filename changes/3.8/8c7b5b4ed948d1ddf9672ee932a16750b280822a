memory-hotplug: suppress "Device nodeX does not have a release() function" warning

When calling unregister_node(), the function shows following message at
device_release().

"Device 'node2' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must
be fixed."

The reason is node's device struct does not have a release() function.

So the patch registers node_device_release() to the device's release()
function for suppressing the warning message.  Additionally, the patch
adds memset() to initialize a node struct into register_node().  Because
the node struct is part of node_devices[] array and it cannot be freed by
node_device_release().  So if system reuses the node struct, it has a
garbage.
