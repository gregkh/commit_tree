ALSA: hda - use usleep_range in link reset and change timeout check

Reducing the time on HDA link reset can help to reduce the driver loading
time. So we replace msleep with usleep_range to get more accurate time
control and change the value to a smaller one. And a 100ms timeout is set
for both entering and exiting the link reset.
