target/file: Fix 32-bit highmem breakage for SGL -> iovec mapping

This patch changes vectored file I/O to use kmap + kunmap when mapping
incoming SGL memory -> struct iovec in order to properly support 32-bit
highmem configurations.  This is because an extra bounce buffer may be
required when processing scatterlist pages allocated with GFP_KERNEL.
