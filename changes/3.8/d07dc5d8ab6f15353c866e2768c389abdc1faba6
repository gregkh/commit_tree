s390/dasd: add safe offline interface

The regular behavior of the DASD device driver when setting a device
offline is to return all outstanding I/O as failed. This behavior is
different from that of other System z operating systems and may lead
to unexpected data loss. Adding an explicit 'safe' offline function
will allow customers to use DASDs in the way they expect them to work.
