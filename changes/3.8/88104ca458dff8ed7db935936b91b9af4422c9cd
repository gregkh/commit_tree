drbd: Allow to change data-integrity-alg on the fly

The main purpose of this is to allow to turn data integrity checking on
and off on demand without causing interruptions.

Implemented by allocating tconn->peer_integrity_tfm only when receiving
a P_PROTOCOL message.  l accesses to tconn->peer_integrity_tf happen in
worker context, and no further synchronization is necessary.

On the sender side, tconn->integrity_tfm is modified under
tconn->data.mutex, and a P_PROTOCOL message is sent whenever.  All
accesses to tconn->integrity_tfm already happen under this mutex.
