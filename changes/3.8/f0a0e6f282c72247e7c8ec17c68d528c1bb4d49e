rcu: Clarify memory-ordering properties of grace-period primitives

This commit explicitly states the memory-ordering properties of the
RCU grace-period primitives.  Although these properties were in some
sense implied by the fundmental property of RCU ("a grace period must
wait for all pre-existing RCU read-side critical sections to complete"),
stating it explicitly will be a great labor-saving device.
