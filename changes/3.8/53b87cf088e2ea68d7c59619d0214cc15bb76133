x86, mm: Include the entire kernel memory map in trampoline_pgd

There are various pieces of code in arch/x86 that require a page table
with an identity mapping. Make trampoline_pgd a proper kernel page
table, it currently only includes the kernel text and module space
mapping.

One new feature of trampoline_pgd is that it now has mappings for the
physical I/O device addresses, which are inserted at ioremap()
time. Some broken implementations of EFI firmware require these
mappings to always be around.
