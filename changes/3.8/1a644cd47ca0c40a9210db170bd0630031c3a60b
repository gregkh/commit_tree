drm: extract dp link train delay functions from radeon

This requires a few changes since that dpcd value is above the
range currently cached by radeon. I've check the dp specs, and
above 0xf there's a big gap and nothing that looks like we should
cache it while a given device is plugged in. It's also the same value
that i915.ko uses.

Hence extend the various dpcd arrays in the radeon driver, use
proper symbolic constants where applicable (one place overallocated
the dpcd array to 25 bytes). Then also drop the rd_interval cache -
radeon_dp_link_train_init re-reads the dpcd block, so the values we'll
consume in train_cr and train_ce will always be fresh.

To avoid needless diff-churn, #define the old size of dpcd as the new
one and keep it around.

v2: Alex Deucher noticed one place where I've forgotten to replace 8
with DP_RECEIVER_CAP_SIZE.
