ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: add USB24 clock explain

USBCKCR is controlling USB parent clock and divide rate.
This parent clock is used as a "usb24s" from other devices,
but the "divide rate" is not used.
Further, this clock itself is known as "usb24".
So, to set this clock is a little confusable.
This patch adds quick explain and sample settings for this clock.
