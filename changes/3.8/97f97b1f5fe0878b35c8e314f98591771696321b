mac80211: fix station destruction in AP/mesh modes

Unfortunately, commit b22cfcfcae5b, intended to speed up roaming
by avoiding the synchronize_rcu() broke AP/mesh modes as it moved
some code into that work item that will still call into the driver
at a time where it's no longer expected to handle this: after the
AP or mesh has been stopped.

To fix this problem remove the per-station work struct, maintain a
station cleanup list instead and flush this list when stations are
flushed. To keep this patch smaller for stable, do this when the
stations are flushed (sta_info_flush()). This unfortunately brings
back the original roaming delay; I'll fix that again in a separate
patch.

Also, Ben reported that the original commit could sometimes (with
many interfaces) cause long delays when an interface is set down,
due to blocking on flush_workqueue(). Since we now maintain the
cleanup list, this particular change of the original patch can be
reverted.
