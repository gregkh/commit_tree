HID: Ignore D-WAV/eGalax devices handled by usbtouchscreen

Previously, both usbhid and usbtouchscreen would bind to D-WAV devices
with class HID and protocol None, so they would be claimed by whichever
driver was loaded first.  Some of these devices do in fact work with
usbhid, but not all of them do.  OTOH they all work with usbtouchscreen
as of commit 037a833ed05a86d01ea27a2c32043b86c549be1b ("Input:
usbtouchscreen - initialize eGalax devices").  So we ignore them in
usbhid to prevent getting in the way of usbtouchscreen and claiming an
interface that we may not be able to do anything useful with.
