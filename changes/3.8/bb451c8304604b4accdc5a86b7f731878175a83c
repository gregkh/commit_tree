brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer access in brcmf_create_iovar()

The function brcmf_fil_bsscfg_data_get() calls brcmf_create_iovar()
with data pointer set to NULL, which caused a NULL pointer access.
As it should be possible to provide data in message towards the
firmware, it should just pass the data buffer instead.
