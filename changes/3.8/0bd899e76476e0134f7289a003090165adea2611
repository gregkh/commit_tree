rtlwifi: rtl8192c: rtl8192ce: Add support for B-CUT version of RTL8188CE

Realtek devices with designation RTL8188CE-VL have the so-called B-cut
of the wireless chip. This patch adds the special programming needed by
these devices. In addition, a variable that was static has been moved into
the private data area as it is now needed in two different routines. This
change also fixes a minor bug that would be present if a system had more
than one RTL81{88,92}CE devices. Other drivers in the rtlwifi family had
already made this change, thus the variable already exists in the private
data structure.
