tracing: Allow tracers to start at core initcall

There's times during debugging that it is helpful to see traces of early
boot functions. But the tracers are initialized at device_initcall()
which is quite late during the boot process. Setting the kernel command
line parameter ftrace=function will not show anything until the function
tracer is initialized. This prevents being able to trace functions before
device_initcall().

There's no reason that the tracers need to be initialized so late in the
boot process. Move them up to core_initcall() as they still need to come
after early_initcall() which initializes the tracing buffers.
