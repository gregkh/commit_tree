HID: round return value of hidinput_calc_abs_res

hidinput_calc_abs_res should return the closest int in the division
instead of the floor.
On a device with a logical_max of 3008 and a physical_max of 255mm,
previous implementation gave a resolution of 11 instead of 12.
With 11, user-space computes a physical size of 273.5mm and the
round_closest results gives 250.6mm.
The old implementation introduced an error of 2cm in this example.
