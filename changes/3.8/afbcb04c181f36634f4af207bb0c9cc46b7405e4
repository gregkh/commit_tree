HID: multitouch: get maxcontacts also from logical_max value

Win8 devices are required to present the feature "Maximum Contact Number".
Fortunately all win7 devices I've seen presents this feature.
If the current value is 0, then, the driver can get the actual supported
contact count by refering to the logical_max.
This win8 specification ensures that logical_max may not be above 250.
This also allows us to detect when devices like irtouch or stantum reports
an obviously wrong value of 255.
