rtnelink: remove unused parameter from rtnl_create_link().

This patch removes an unused parameter (src_net) from rtnl_create_link()
method and from the method single invocation, in veth.
This parameter was used in the past when calling
ops->get_tx_queues(src_net, tb) in rtnl_create_link().
The get_tx_queues() member of rtnl_link_ops was replaced by two methods,
get_num_tx_queues() and get_num_rx_queues(), which do not get any
parameter. This was done in commit d40156aa5ecbd51fed932ed4813df82b56e5ff4d by
Jiri Pirko ("rtnl: allow to specify different num for rx and tx queue count").
