swiotlb: Make io_tlb_end a physical address instead of a virtual one

This change replaces all references to the virtual address for io_tlb_end
with references to the physical address io_tlb_end.  The main advantage of
replacing the virtual address with a physical address is that we can avoid
having to do multiple translations from the virtual address to the physical
one needed for testing an existing DMA address.
