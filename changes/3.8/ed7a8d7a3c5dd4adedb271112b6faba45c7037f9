KVM: Move some PPC ioctl definitions to the correct place

This moves the definitions of KVM_CREATE_SPAPR_TCE and
KVM_ALLOCATE_RMA in include/linux/kvm.h from the section listing the
vcpu ioctls to the section listing VM ioctls, as these are both
implemented and documented as VM ioctls.

Fortunately there is no actual collision of ioctl numbers at this
point.  Moving these to the correct section will reduce the
probability of a future collision.  This does not change the
user/kernel ABI at all.
