[media] gspca_pac7302: use registers 0x01 and 0x03 for red and blue balance controls

Currently used registers 0xc5 and 0xc7 provide only a very coarse
adjustment possibility within a very small value range (0-3).
With registers 0x01 and 0x03, a fine grained adjustment with
255 steps is possible. This is also what the Windows driver does.
