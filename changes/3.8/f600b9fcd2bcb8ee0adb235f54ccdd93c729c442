ARM: cti: fix manipulation of debug lock registers

The LOCKSTATUS register for memory-mapped coresight devices indicates
whether or not the device in question implements hardware locking. If
not, locking is not present (i.e. LSR.SLI == 0) and LAR is write-ignore,
so software doesn't actually need to check the status register at all.

This patch removes the broken LSR checks.
