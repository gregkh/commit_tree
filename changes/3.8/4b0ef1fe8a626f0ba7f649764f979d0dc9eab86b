page_alloc: use N_MEMORY instead N_HIGH_MEMORY change the node_states initialization

N_HIGH_MEMORY stands for the nodes that has normal or high memory.
N_MEMORY stands for the nodes that has any memory.

The code here need to handle with the nodes which have memory, we should
use N_MEMORY instead.

Since we introduced N_MEMORY, we update the initialization of node_states.
