pwm: New driver to support PWM driven LEDs on TWL4030/6030 series of PMICs

The driver supports the following LED outputs as generic PWM driver:
TWL4030 LEDA and LEDB (PWMA and PWMB)
TWL6030 Charging indicator LED (PWM LED)

On TWL6030 when the PWM requested LED is configured to be controlled by SW.
In this case the user can enable/disable and set the duty period freely.
When the PWM has been freed, the LED driver is put back to HW control.
