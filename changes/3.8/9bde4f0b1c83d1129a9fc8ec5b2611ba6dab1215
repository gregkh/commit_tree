ASoC: core: Fix SOC_DOUBLE_RANGE() macros

Although we've had macros defining double _RANGE controls for a while now
they've not actually been backed up properly by the implementation, it's
treated everything as mono. Fix that by implementing the handling in the
stereo controls, ensuring that the mono controls don't mistakenly get
treated as stereo.
