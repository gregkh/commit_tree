pidns: Capture the user namespace and filter ns_last_pid

- Capture the the user namespace that creates the pid namespace
- Use that user namespace to test if it is ok to write to
  /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid.

Zhao Hongjiang <zhaohongjiang@huawei.com> noticed I was missing a put_user_ns
in when destroying a pid_ns.  I have foloded his patch into this one
so that bisects will work properly.
