rcu: Add new rcutorture module parameters to start/end test messages

Several new rcutorture module parameters have been added, but are not
printed to the console at the beginning and end of tests, which makes
it difficult to reproduce a prior test.  This commit therefore adds
these new module parameters to the list printed at the beginning and
the end of the tests.
