ath9k: Add new BT profile info A2DP_Voice

When the BT connection is initiated by headset, it's possible that headset
requests to make one A2DP and one Voice connection over the same link.
BT firmware will send a new profile A2DP_Voice in this case. So WLAN
has to take care of this new profile for tuning BTCOEX parameters.
