xfs: remove xfs_iget.c

The inode cache functions remaining in xfs_iget.c can be moved to xfs_icache.c
along with the other inode cache functions. This removes all functionality from
xfs_iget.c, so the file can simply be removed.

This move results in various functions now only having the scope of a single
file (e.g. xfs_inode_free()), so clean up all the definitions and exported
prototypes in xfs_icache.[ch] and xfs_inode.h appropriately.
