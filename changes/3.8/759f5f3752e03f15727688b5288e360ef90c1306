gpio: add TS-5500 DIO blocks support

Technologic Systems TS-5500 provides digital I/O lines exposed through
pin blocks. On this platform, there are three of them, named DIO1, DIO2
and LCD port, that may be used as a DIO block.

The TS-5500 pin blocks are described in the product's wiki:
http://wiki.embeddedarm.com/wiki/TS-5500#Digital_I.2FO

This driver is not limited to the TS-5500 blocks. It can be extended to
support similar boards pin blocks, such as on the TS-5600.

This patch is the V2 of the previous https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/25/671
with corrections suggested by Linus Walleij.
