TTY: n_tty, simplify read_buf+echo_buf allocation

ldisc->open and close are called only once and cannot cross. So the
tests in open and close are superfluous. Remove them. (But leave sets
to NULL to ensure there is not a bug somewhere.)

And when the tests are gone, handle properly failures in open. We
leaked read_buf if allocation of echo_buf failed before. Now this is
not the case anymore.
