PCI/ACPI: Add _PRT interrupt routing info before enumerating devices

We used to add the _PRT after enumerating devices behind a new host
bridge.  This moves the _PRT addition *before* the enumeration, since
it no longer depends on the struct pci_bus existing.  This is one
step towards consolidating the .add/.start methods.
