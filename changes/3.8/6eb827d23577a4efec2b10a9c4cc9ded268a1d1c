ALSA: hda - Move runtime PM check to runtime_idle callback

The runtime_idle callback is the right place to check the suspend
capability, but currently we do it wrongly in the runtime_suspend
callback.  This leads to a kernel error message like:
   pci_pm_runtime_suspend(): azx_runtime_suspend+0x0/0x50 [snd_hda_intel] returns -11
and the runtime PM core would even repeat the attempts.
