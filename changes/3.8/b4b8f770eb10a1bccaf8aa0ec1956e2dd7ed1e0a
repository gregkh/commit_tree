ARM: kernel: update cpuinfo to print all online CPUs features

Currently, reading /proc/cpuinfo provides userspace with CPU ID of
the CPU carrying out the read from the file. This is fine as long as all
CPUs in the system are the same. With the advent of big.LITTLE and
heterogenous ARM systems this approach provides user space with incorrect
bits of information since CPU ids in the system might differ from the one
provided by the CPU reading the file.

This patch updates the cpuinfo show function so that a read from
/proc/cpuinfo prints HW information for all online CPUs at once, mirroring
 x86 behaviour.
