ptp: add an ioctl to compare PHC time with system time

This patch adds an ioctl for PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) devices that allows
user space to measure the time offset between the PHC and the system
clock. Rather than hard coding any kind of estimation algorithm into the
kernel, this patch takes the more flexible approach of just delivering
an array of raw clock readings. In that way, the user space clock servo
may be adapted to new and different hardware clocks.
