jbd2: remove VLAIS usage from JBD2 code

The use of variable length arrays in structs (VLAIS) in the Linux Kernel code
precludes the use of compilers which don't implement VLAIS (for instance the
Clang compiler). Since ctx is always a 32-bit CRC, hard coding a size of 4
bytes accomplishes the same thing without the use of VLAIS. This is the same
technique already employed in fs/ext4/ext4.h
