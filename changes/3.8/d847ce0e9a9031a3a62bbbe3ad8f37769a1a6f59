ALSA: usb-audio: parameterize FTU effect unit control

Adds the unit ID and the control as parameters to the creation of the
effect unit control for the M-Audio Fast Track Ultra. This allows the
code to be shared with other devices that use different unit ID and
control, such as the M-Audio Fast Track C400.
