xfs: growfs: don't read garbage for new secondary superblocks

When updating new secondary superblocks in a growfs operation, the
superblock buffer is read from the newly grown region of the
underlying device. This is not guaranteed to be zero, so violates
the underlying assumption that the unused parts of superblocks are
zero filled. Get a new buffer for these secondary superblocks to
ensure that the unused regions are zero filled correctly.
