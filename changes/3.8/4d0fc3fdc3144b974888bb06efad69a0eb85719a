drbd: Fixed compat issue with disconnecting 8.4 from a primary 8.3

For compatibility reasons 8.4 has to send P_STATE_CHG_REQ (instead
of P_CONN_ST_CHG_REQ) when disconnecting.

In the receiving code path we missed to convert the old
answer (P_STATE_CHG_REPLY) back to 8.4 logic. Therefore
the CL_ST_CHG_SUCCESS or CL_ST_CHG_FAIL bit in the flags word
of mdev got set, while the state code was waiting for
the CONN_WD_ST_CHG_OKAY or CONN_WD_ST_CHG_FAIL bits in tconn.
