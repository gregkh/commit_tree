ata_piix: reenable MS Virtual PC guests

An earlier commit cd006086fa5d91414d8ff9ff2b78fbb593878e3c ("ata_piix:
defer disks to the Hyper-V drivers by default") broke MS Virtual PC
guests. Hyper-V guests and Virtual PC guests have nearly identical DMI
info. As a result the driver does currently ignore the emulated hardware
in Virtual PC guests and defers the handling to hv_blkvsc. Since Virtual
PC does not offer paravirtualized drivers no disks will be found in the
guest.

One difference in the DMI info is the product version. This patch adds a
match for MS Virtual PC 2007 and "unignores" the emulated hardware.

This was reported for openSuSE 12.1 in bugzilla:

Here is a detailed list of DMI info from example guests:
