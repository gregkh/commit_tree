sl[au]b: Process slabinfo_show in common code

With all the infrastructure in place, we can now have slabinfo_show
done from slab_common.c. A cache-specific function is called to grab
information about the cache itself, since that is still heavily
dependent on the implementation. But with the values produced by it, all
the printing and handling is done from common code.
