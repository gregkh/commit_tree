drbd: Try to connec to peer only once per cycle

Since now our listening socket is open all the time we will get
connection tries of the peer always in. No need to try it three
times.

This is valid when connecting to older peers as well, it simply
increases the probability that the new version DRBD will accept
a connection instead that it will establish one.
