NFSv4.1: Ping server when our session table limits are too high

If the server requests a lower target_highest_slotid, then ensure
that we ping it with at least one RPC call containing an
appropriate SEQUENCE op. This ensures that the server won't need to
send a recall callback in order to shrink the slot table.
