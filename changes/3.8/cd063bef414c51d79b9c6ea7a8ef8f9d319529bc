target/sbc: Seperate WRITE_SAME based on UNMAP flag in sbc_ops

This patch adds a new sbc_ops->execute_write_same_unmap() caller for use
with WRITE_SAME w/ UNMAP=1, and performs the ->execute_cmd() setup based
this bit within sbc_setup_write_same() code.

Also, makes the changes in sbc_parse_cdb() to handle a sense_reason_t
return from sbc_setup_write_same() on error.
