staging: comedi: cb_pcidas64: update driver comment

Update the comedi driver comment to reflect the fact that manual
attachment of devices is no longer supported.  Also replace the request
to file a bug report about unidentified PCI device IDs with a request to
let the maintainers know about such devices.

Reformat the comment using the usual block comment style.
