brcmfmac: add function converting ieee80211_channel to chanspec

The firmware carries channel information in a different format
as the provided ieee80211_channel structure. Conversion is needed
when receiving requests from cfg80211 carrying ieee80211_channel
structures. This patch adds a utility function to do that.
