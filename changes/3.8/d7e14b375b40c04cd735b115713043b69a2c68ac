USB: ftdi_sio: Add support for Newport AGILIS motor drivers

The Newport AGILIS model AG-UC8 compact piezo motor controller
(http://search.newport.com/?q=*&x2=sku&q2=AG-UC8)
is yet another device using an FTDI USB-to-serial chip. It works
fine with the ftdi_sio driver when adding

  options ftdi-sio product=0x3000 vendor=0x104d

to modprobe.d. udevadm reports "Newport" as the manufacturer,
and "Agilis" as the product name.
