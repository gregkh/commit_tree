True. Fixed.

Correct. I did the conversion and tested that the partitions
can be read with dd and produce exactly the same data before and
after conversion. So, the partition offsets at least should be fine.

Ok, I did convert the i2c definition to use the devicetree.
The adt7476 device itself is not at reach of device tree,
AFAIK and requires more work at there?

Thanks for your valuable comments. Following is a new patch that
should address the problems and mistakes you pointed and also
some of the pointed by Jason Cooper. The nand and i2c are now
defined at DT and I also removed the pointless defines and
ARM_APPENDED_DTB. It is based against the Linus' official
3.6 version.

Best regards,
Tero
