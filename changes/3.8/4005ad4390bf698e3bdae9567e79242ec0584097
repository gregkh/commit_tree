EHCI: implement new semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP

This patch (as1612) updates the isochronous scheduling and processing
in ehci-hcd to match the new semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP.  It also adds
a missing "unlikely" in sitd_complete() to match the corresponding
statement in itd_complete(), and it increments urb->error_count in a
couple of places that had been overlooked.
