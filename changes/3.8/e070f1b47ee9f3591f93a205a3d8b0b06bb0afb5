[media] davinci: vpif_capture: fix return type check for v4l2_subdev_call()

The v4l2_subdev_call() call returns -ENODEV when subdev is
null and -ENOIOCTLCMD wnen no icotl is present.
This patch fixes the return type check for v4l2_subdev_call().
The pattern E == C1 && E == C2 is always false. This patch
fix this according to the assumption that && should be ||.
