numa: add CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE for movable-dedicated node

We need a node which only contains movable memory.  This feature is very
important for node hotplug.  If a node has normal/highmem, the memory may
be used by the kernel and can't be offlined.  If the node only contains
movable memory, we can offline the memory and the node.

All are prepared, we can actually introduce N_MEMORY.
add CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE make we can use it for movable-dedicated node
