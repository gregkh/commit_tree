sbp-target: fix error path in sbp_make_tpg()

If the TPG memory is allocated successfully, but we fail further along
in the function, a dangling pointer to freed memory is left in the TPort
structure. This is mostly harmless, but does prevent re-trying the
operation without first removing the TPort altogether.
