rt2x00: rt2800lib: introduce RFCSR3_VCOCAL_EN

On the RF3290,RF5360,RF5370,RF5372,RF5390,RF5392
radio frontends, the VCO calibration can be
controlled via the RFCSR3 register. The current
code uses the RFCSR30_RF_CALIBRATION constant to
enable the calibration, however that belongs to
the RFCSR30 register. Although the values of the
constant is correct, but using that for another
register is confusing.

Add a new definition for the VCO calibration enable
bit of the RFCSR3 register and use that in the
relevant places in order to avoid confusions.

The patch contains no functional changes.
