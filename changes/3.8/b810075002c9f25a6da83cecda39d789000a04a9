usb: gadget: FunctionFS: Fix missing braces in parse_opts

Add missing braces around an if block in ffs_fs_parse_opts. This broke
parsing the uid/gid mount options and causes mount to fail when using
uid/gid. This has been introduced by commit b9b73f7c (userns: Convert usb
functionfs to use kuid/kgid where appropriate) in 3.7.
