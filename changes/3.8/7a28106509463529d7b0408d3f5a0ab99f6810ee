ARM: tegra: don't include iomap.h from debug-macro.S

In order to move Tegra's debug-macro.S to a common location for single
zImage, it must not rely on any machine-specific header files such as
<mach/iomap.h>. Duplicate the few physical address definitions that
debug-macro.S relies upon directly into the file.

To avoid tegra_io_desc[] requiring shared knowledge of the UART
mapping's virtual address, use a virtual address outside the ranges
in tegra_io_desc[]. Call debug_ll_io_init() to propagate the mapping
beyond the early pages tables.
