Smack: create a sysfs mount point for smackfs

There are a number of "conventions" for where to put LSM filesystems.
Smack adheres to none of them. Create a mount point at /sys/fs/smackfs
for mounting smackfs so that Smack can be conventional.

Targeted for git://git.gitorious.org/smack-next/kernel.git
