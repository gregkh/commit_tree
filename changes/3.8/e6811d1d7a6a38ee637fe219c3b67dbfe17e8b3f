spi: make sure all transfer has bits_per_word set

When spi client does the spi transfer and does not sets
the bits_per_word for each transfer then set it as default
of spi device in spi core before calling low level transfer.

Removing the similar code from spi-tegra20-slink driver as
it is not required.
