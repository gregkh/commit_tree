ath9k_hw: Fix signal strength / channel noise reporting

While AR_PHY_CCA_NOM_VAL_* does contain the expected internal noise floor
for a chip measured in clean air, it refers to the lowest expected reading.

Depending on the frequency, this measurement can vary by about 6db, thus
causing a higher reported channel noise and signal strength.

Factor in the 6db offset when converting internal noisefloor to channel noise.

This patch makes the reported values more accurate for all chips without
affecting NF calibration behavior.
