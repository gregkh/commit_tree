TTY: devpts, return created inode from devpts_pty_new

The goal is to stop setting and using tty->driver_data in devpts code.
It should be used solely by the driver's code, pty in this case.

For the cleanup of layering, we will need the inode created in
devpts_pty_new to be stored into slave's driver_data. So we convert
devpts_pty_new to return the inode or an ERR_PTR-encoded error in case
of failure.

The move of 'inode = new_inode(sb);' from declarators to the code is
only cosmetical, but it makes the code easier to read.
