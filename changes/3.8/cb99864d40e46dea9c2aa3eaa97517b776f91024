ALSA: usb-audio: Support for Digidesign Mbox 2 USB sound card:

This patch is the result of a lot of trial and error, since there are no specs
available for the device.

Full duplex support is provided, i.e. playback and recording in stereo.
The format is hardcoded at 48000Hz @ 24 bit, which is the maximum that the
device supports.  Also, MIDI in and MIDI out both work.

Users will notice that the S/PDIF light also flashes when playback or recording
is active.  I believe this means that S/PDIF input/output is simultaneously
activated with the analogue i/o during use.
But this particular functionality remains untested.

Note that this particular version of the patch is so far untested on the
physical hardware because I have not compiled a full kernel with the changes.
However, extensive testing has been done by many users of the hardware
who believe other versions of my patch have worked since circa 2009.
