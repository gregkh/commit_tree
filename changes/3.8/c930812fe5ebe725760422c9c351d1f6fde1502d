udldrmfb: Fix EDID not working with monitors with EDID extension blocks

udldrmfb only reads the main EDID block, and if that advertises extensions
the drm_edid code expects them to be present, and starts reading beyond the
buffer udldrmfb passes it.

Although it may be possible to read more EDID info with the udl we simpy don't
know how, and even if trial and error gets it working on one device, that is
no guarantee it will work on other revisions. So this patch does a simple fix
in the form of patching the EDID info to report 0 extension blocks, this
fixes udldrmfb only doing 1024x768 on monitors with EDID extension blocks.
