Bluetooth: Use proper invalid value for tx_power

The core specification defines 127 as the "not available" value (well,
"reserved" for BR/EDR and "not available" for LE - but essentially the
same). Therefore, instead of testing for 0 (which is in fact a valid
value) we should be using this invalid value to test if the tx_power is
available.
