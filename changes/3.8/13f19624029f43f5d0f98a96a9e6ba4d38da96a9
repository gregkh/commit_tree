HID: hiddev: fix nonblocking read semantics wrt EIO/ERESTARTSYS

When the file has been open in non-blocking mode, EIO or ERESTARTSYS
would never be returned even if they should (for example when device
has been unplugged, you want EIO and not EAGAIN to be returned).

Move the O_NONBLOCK check after other checks have been performed.

Base on similar patch done to hidraw by
