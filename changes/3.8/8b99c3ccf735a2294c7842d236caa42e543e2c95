inotify: dont skip removal of watch descriptor if creation of ignored event failed

In inotify_ignored_and_remove_idr() the removal of a watch descriptor is skipped
if the allocation of an ignored event failed and we are leaking memory (the
watch descriptor and the mark linked to it).
This patch ensures that the watch descriptor is removed regardless of whether
event creation failed or not.
