cpuidle / sysfs: move structure declaration into the sysfs.c file

The structure cpuidle_state_kobj is not used anywhere except
in the sysfs.c file. The definition of this structure is not
needed in the cpuidle header file. This patch moves it to the
sysfs.c file in order to encapsulate the code a bit more.
