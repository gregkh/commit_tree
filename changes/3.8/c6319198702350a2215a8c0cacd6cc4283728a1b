xfs: verify dquot blocks as they are read from disk

Add a dquot buffer verify callback function and pass it into the
buffer read functions. This checks all the dquots in a buffer, but
cannot completely verify the dquot ids are correct. Also, errors
cannot be repaired, so an additional function is added to repair bad
dquots in the buffer if such an error is detected in a context where
repair is allowed.
