tuntap: add ioctl to attach or detach a file form tuntap device

Sometimes usespace may need to active/deactive a queue, this could be done by
detaching and attaching a file from tuntap device.

This patch introduces a new ioctls - TUNSETQUEUE which could be used to do
this. Flag IFF_ATTACH_QUEUE were introduced to do attaching while
IFF_DETACH_QUEUE were introduced to do the detaching.
