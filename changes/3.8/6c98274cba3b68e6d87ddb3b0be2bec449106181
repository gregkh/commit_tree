staging/olpc_dcon: drop pin frobbing code for xo1.5

This code looks in the PCI config space for pin addresses and sets up some
stuff.  However, Openfirmware has already done this for us, so there's no
need to ever do it in Linux.  According to Mitch Bradley, this OFW has been
doing this for us since at least B3 builds (pre-mass production).
