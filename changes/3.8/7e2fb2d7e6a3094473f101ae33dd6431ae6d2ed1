jbd: don't wake kjournald unnecessarily

Don't send an extra wakeup to kjournald in the case where we
already have the proper target in j_commit_request, i.e. that
commit has already been requested for commit.

commit d9b0193 "jbd: fix fsync() tid wraparound bug" changed
the logic leading to a wakeup, but it caused some extra wakeups
which were found to lead to a measurable performance regression.
