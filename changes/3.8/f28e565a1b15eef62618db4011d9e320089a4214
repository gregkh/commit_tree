rbd: remove options args from rbd_add_parse_args()

They "options" argument to rbd_add_parse_args() (and it's partner
options_size) is now only needed within the function, so there's no
need to have the caller allocate and pass the options buffer.  Just
allocate the options buffer within the function using dup_token().

Also distinguish between failures due to failed memory allocation
and failing because a required argument was missing.
