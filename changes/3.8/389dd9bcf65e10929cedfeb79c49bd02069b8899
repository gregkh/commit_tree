tipc: rename supported flag to recv_permitted

Rename the "supported" flag in bclink structure to "recv_permitted"
to better reflect what it is used for. When this flag is set for a
given node, we are permitted to receive and acknowledge broadcast
messages from that node.  Convert it to a bool at the same time,
since it is not used to store any numerical values.
