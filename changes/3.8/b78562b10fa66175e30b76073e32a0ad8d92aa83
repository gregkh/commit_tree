ALSA: hda - Fix the wrong pincaps set in ALC861VD dallas/hp fixup

The workaround to force VREF50 for dallas/hp model with ALC861VD
was introduced in commit 8fdcb6fe4204bdb4c6991652717ab5063751414e,
but it contained wrong pincap override bits.

This patch fixes to exclude VREF80 pincap bit correctly.
