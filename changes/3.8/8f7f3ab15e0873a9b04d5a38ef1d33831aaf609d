ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for Creative BT-D1 via usb sound quirks

Support the Creative BT-D1 Bluetooth USB audio device. Before this
patch, Linux had trouble finding the correct USB descriptors and bailed
out with these messages:

 no or invalid class specific endpoint descriptor

Now it still prints these messages on hotplug:

 snd-usb-audio: probe of ...:1.0 failed with error -5
 snd-usb-audio: probe of ...:1.2 failed with error -5
 snd-usb-audio: probe of ...:1.3 failed with error -5

But the device works correctly, including the HID support.

The patch is diff'ed against 3.8-rc1 but should apply to older kernels
as well.
