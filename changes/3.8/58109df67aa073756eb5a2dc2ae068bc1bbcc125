ath6kl: Fix reconnection issue after recovery

Disallowing any wmi commands while re-initializing the
firmware results in connection failures after recovery
is done in open/WEP mode. To fix this, clear WMI_READY,
to make sure no wmi command is tried while fw is down.
Remove ATH6KL_STATE_RECOVERY state check in ath6kl_control_tx()
so that any configuration during fw init time will go through
using wmi commands.
