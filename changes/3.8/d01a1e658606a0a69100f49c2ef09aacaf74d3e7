mac80211: introduce channel context skeleton code

Channel context are the foundation for multi-channel
operation. They are are immutable and are re-created
(or re-used if other interfaces are bound to a certain
channel and a compatible channel type) on channel
switching.

This is an initial implementation and more features
will come in separate patches.
