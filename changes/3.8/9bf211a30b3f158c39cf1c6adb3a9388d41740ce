net: cdc_mbim: adding MBIM driver

The CDC Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM) specification
extends CDC NCM by
 - removing the redundant ethernet header from the point-to-point
   USB channel
 - adding support for multiple IP (v4 and/or v6) sessions multiplexed
   on the same USB channel
 - adding a MBIM control channel encapsulated in CDC
 - adding Device Service Streams (DSS), which are non IP generic data
   streams multiplexed on the same USB channel as the IP sessions

MBIM devices are managed using the dedicated control channel, and no
data will flow on the data channel until a control session has been
established.  This driver has no knowledge of MBIM control messages.
It just exports the control channel to a /dev/cdc-wdmX character
device for userspace management applications. Such an application is
therefore required to use this driver.

This patch implements basic MBIM support, reusing the NCM and WDM driver
APIs, currently limited to IP sessions with SessionID 0. DSS and
multiplexed IP sessions are not yet supported.
