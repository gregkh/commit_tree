Revert "sh-sci / PM: Avoid deadlocking runtime PM"

This reverts commit 048be431e4 (sh-sci / PM: Avoid deadlocking runtime
PM, from Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>, 2012-03-09).

In order to get console PM work properly, we should implement uart_ops
->pm() operation, rather than sprinkle band-ading runtime PM calls in
the driver.
