rbd: kill rbd_device->rbd_opts

The rbd_device structure has an embedded rbd_options structure.
Such a structure is needed to work with the generic ceph argument
parsing code, but there's no need to keep it around once argument
parsing is done.

Use a local variable to hold the rbd options used in parsing in
rbd_get_client(), and just transfer its content (it's just a
read_only flag) into the field in the rbd_mapping sub-structure
that requires that information.
