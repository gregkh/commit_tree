hwpoison, hugetlbfs: fix "bad pmd" warning in unmapping hwpoisoned hugepage

When a process which used a hwpoisoned hugepage tries to exit() or
munmap(), the kernel can print out "bad pmd" message because page table
walker in free_pgtables() encounters 'hwpoisoned entry' on pmd.

This is because currently we fail to clear the hwpoisoned entry in
__unmap_hugepage_range(), so this patch simply does it.
