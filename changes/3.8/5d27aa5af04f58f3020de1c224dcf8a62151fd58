mtd: uninitialized variable warning in map.h

The map_word_load() function initializes exactly
as many words in the buffer as required, but gcc
cannot figure this out and gives a misleading
warning. Marking the local variable as
uninitialized_var shuts up that warning.

Without this patch, building acs5k_defconfig results in:

drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_cmdset_0002.c: In function 'cfi_amdstd_panic_write':
include/linux/mtd/map.h:331:11: warning: 'r.x[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
