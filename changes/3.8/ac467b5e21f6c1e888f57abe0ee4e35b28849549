staging: comedi: addi_apci_1032: remove the boardinfo

This driver supports only one boardtype. Since this driver uses the
comedi auto attach mechanism, the information left in the boaridnfo
is not required to attach this driver to the comedi subsystem.

Remove the boardinfo data and its use in the driver.
