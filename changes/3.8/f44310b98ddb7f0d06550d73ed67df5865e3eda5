smp: Fix SMP function call empty cpu mask race

I get the following warning every day with v3.7, once or
twice a day:

  [ 2235.186027] WARNING: at /mnt/sda7/kernel/linux/arch/x86/kernel/apic/ipi.c:109 default_send_IPI_mask_logical+0x2f/0xb8()

As explained by Linus as well:

 |
 | Once we've done the "list_add_rcu()" to add it to the
 | queue, we can have (another) IPI to the target CPU that can
 | now see it and clear the mask.
 |
 | So by the time we get to actually send the IPI, the mask might
 | have been cleared by another IPI.
 |

This patch also fixes a system hang problem, if the data->cpumask
gets cleared after passing this point:

        if (WARN_ONCE(!mask, "empty IPI mask"))
                return;

then the problem in commit 83d349f35e1a ("x86: don't send an IPI to
the empty set of CPU's") will happen again.
