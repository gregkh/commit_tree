usb: musb: read MUSB_POWER register only when required.

This is part of the workaround for AM35x advisory Advisory 1.1.20.
The advisory says that the IPSS bridge can't handle 8 & 16 bit read
access. An 8bit read access to MUSB_POWER results in an 32bit read
access which also reads INTRTX and therefore may lose interrupts.
This patch tries to minimize reads to MUSB_POWER and perform them only
when required.
