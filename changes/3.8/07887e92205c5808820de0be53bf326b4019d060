NFC: Fix hci_connect_gate() when a pre-opened pipe is passed

In some cases, pre-opened pipes don't stay open when a clear all pipes
command is sent. They stay created however. Therefore, one can never
assume that such a pipe is already open. As re-opening a pipe seems not
to be a problem, we do that now.
