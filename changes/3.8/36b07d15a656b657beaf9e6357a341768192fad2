ath9k: check pdata variable before dereferencing it

Due to my recent commit (ath9k: allow to load EEPROM
content via firmware API) smatch complains about that
the 'pdata' variable in 'ath9k_hw_init' can be NULL
and it is dereferenced before checking that. That is
absolutely correct.

Check the 'pdata' variable before using it to avoid
a NULL pointer dereference.
