libceph: avoid NULL kref_put from NULL alloc_msg return

The ceph_on_in_msg_alloc() method calls the ->alloc_msg() helper which
may return NULL.  It also drops con->mutex while it allocates a message,
which means that the connection state may change (e.g., get closed).  If
that happens, we clean up and bail out.  Avoid calling ceph_msg_put() on
a NULL return value and triggering a crash.

This was observed when an ->alloc_msg() call races with a timeout that
resends a zillion messages and resets the connection, and ->alloc_msg()
returns NULL (because the request was resent to another target).
