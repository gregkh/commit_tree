drm/i915: Defer assignment of obj->gtt_space until after all possible mallocs

As we may invoke the shrinker whilst trying to allocate memory to hold
the gtt_space for this object, we need to be careful not to mark the
drm_mm_node as activated (by assigning it to this object) before we
have finished our sequence of allocations.

Note: We also need to move the binding of the object into the actual
pagetables down a bit. The best way seems to be to move it out into
the callsites.
