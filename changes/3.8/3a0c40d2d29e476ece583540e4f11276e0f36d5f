aoe: improve network congestion handling

The aoe driver already had some congestion handling, but it was limited in
its ability to cope with the kind of congestion that can arise on more
complex networks such as those involving paths through multiple ethernet
switches.

Some of the lessons from TCP's history of development can be applied to
improving the congestion control and avoidance on AoE storage networks.
These changes use familar concepts from Van Jacobson's "Congestion
Avoidance and Control" paper from '88, without adding significant
overhead.

This patch depends on an upcoming patch that covers the failover case when
AoE commands being retransmitted are transferred from one retransmit queue
to another.  Another upcoming patch increases the timing accuracy.
