dm persistent data: rename node to btree_node

This patch fixes a compilation failure on sparc32 by renaming struct node.

struct node is already defined in include/linux/node.h. On sparc32, it
happens to be included through other dependencies and persistent-data
doesn't compile because of conflicting declarations.
