block: Make blk_cleanup_queue() wait until request_fn finished

Some request_fn implementations, e.g. scsi_request_fn(), unlock
the queue lock internally. This may result in multiple threads
executing request_fn for the same queue simultaneously. Keep
track of the number of active request_fn calls and make sure that
blk_cleanup_queue() waits until all active request_fn invocations
have finished. A block driver may start cleaning up resources
needed by its request_fn as soon as blk_cleanup_queue() finished,
so blk_cleanup_queue() must wait for all outstanding request_fn
invocations to finish.
