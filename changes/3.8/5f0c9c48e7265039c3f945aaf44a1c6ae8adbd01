aoe: use high-resolution RTTs with fallback to low-res

These changes improve the accuracy of the decision about whether it's time
to retransmit an AoE command by using the microsecond-resolution
gettimeofday instead of jiffies.

Because the system time can jump suddenly, the decision reverts to using
jiffies if the high-resolution time difference is relatively large.
Otherwise the AoE targets could be considered failed inappropriately.
