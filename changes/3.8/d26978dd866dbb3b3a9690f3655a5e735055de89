xfs: pull up stack_switch check into xfs_bmapi_write

The stack_switch check currently occurs in __xfs_bmapi_allocate,
which means the stack switch only occurs when xfs_bmapi_allocate()
is called in a loop. Pull the check up before the loop in
xfs_bmapi_write() such that the first iteration of the loop has
consistent behavior.
