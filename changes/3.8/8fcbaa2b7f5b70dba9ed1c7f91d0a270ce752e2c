TTY: devpts, don't care about TTY in devpts_get_tty

The goal is to stop setting and using tty->driver_data in devpts code.
It should be used solely by the driver's code, pty in this case.

First, here we remove TTY from devpts_get_tty and rename it to
devpts_get_priv. Note we do not remove type safety, we just shift the
[implicit] (void *) cast one layer up.

index was unused in devpts_get_tty, so remove that from the prototype
too.
