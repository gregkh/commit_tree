mm/sl[au]b: Move print_slabinfo_header to slab_common.c

The header format is highly similar between slab and slub. The main
difference lays in the fact that slab may optionally have statistics
added here in case of CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG, while the slub will stick them
somewhere else.

By making sure that information conditionally lives inside a
globally-visible CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB switch, we can move the header
printing to a common location.
