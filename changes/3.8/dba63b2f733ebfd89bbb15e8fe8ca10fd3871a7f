USB: EHCI: fix build error in ehci-mxc

This patch (as1643b) fixes a build error in ehci-hcd when compiling for
ARM with allmodconfig:

drivers/usb/host/ehci-hcd.c:1285:0: warning: "PLATFORM_DRIVER" redefined [enabled by default]
drivers/usb/host/ehci-hcd.c:1255:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
drivers/usb/host/ehci-mxc.c:280:31: warning: 'ehci_mxc_driver' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
drivers/usb/host/ehci-hcd.c:1285:0: warning: "PLATFORM_DRIVER" redefined [enabled by default]
drivers/usb/host/ehci-hcd.c:1255:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition

The fix is to convert ehci-mxc over to the new "ehci-hcd is a library"
scheme so that it can coexist peacefully with the ehci-platform
driver.  As part of the conversion the ehci_mxc_priv data structure,
which was allocated dynamically, is now placed where it belongs: in
the private area at the end of struct ehci_hcd.
