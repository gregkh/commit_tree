ARM: nomadik: bump the IRQ numbers again

Bump the IRQ numbers from offset at 1 (right above NO_IRQ)
to 32. This is the painful way to learn that if you're using
SPARSE_IRQ and avoid to define .nr_irqs in your machine,
the first 16 IRQs will be pre-allocated, and the IRQdomain
code (as the VIC core code before it) will then assume
that all IRQ descriptors are pre-allocated, and 16 of them
are - by somebody else. So mapping the IRQs will fail in
irq_create_mapping(). Moving the offset upward rids us of
this problem.
