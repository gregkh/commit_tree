i2c: s3c2410: do not special case HDMIPHY stuck bus detection

Commit "i2c-s3c2410: Add HDMIPHY quirk for S3C2440" added support for
HDMIPHY with some special handling in s3c24xx_i2c_set_master:

"due to unknown reason (probably HW bug in HDMIPHY and/or the controller)
a transfer fails to finish. The controller hangs after sending the last
byte, the workaround for this bug is resetting the controller after each
transfer"

The "unknown reason" was that the proper sequence for generating a STOP
condition wasn't being followed as per the datasheet. Since this is fixed
by "PATCH: i2c-s3c2410: do not generate STOP for QUIRK_HDMIPHY buses",
remove the special handling.
