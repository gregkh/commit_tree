fsnotify: dont put marks on temporary list when clearing marks by group

In clear_marks_by_group_flags() the mark list of a group is iterated and the
marks are put on a temporary list.
Since we introduced fsnotify_destroy_mark_locked() we dont need the temp list
any more and are able to remove the marks while the mark list is iterated and
the mark list mutex is held.
