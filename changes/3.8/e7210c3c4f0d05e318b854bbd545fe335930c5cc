drm/i915: move more pte encoding to pte encode

In order to handle differences in pte encoding between architectures it
is desirable to have one helper function, pte_encode, do it all for us.
As such, this commit moves the code around so we're in good shape to do
that.

Luckily the ppgtt pte and the ggtt pte look very similar.
