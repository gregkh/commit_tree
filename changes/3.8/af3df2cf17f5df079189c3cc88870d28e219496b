perf tools: Try to build Documentation when installing

There's a portion in the "perf list" output refering to the exact
specification of raw hardware events.

Since this description is in the perf-list manpage, try to build and
install the man pages, warning the user when that is not possible
due to missing packages (xmlto and asciidoc).
