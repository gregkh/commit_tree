HID: i2c-hid: fix i2c_hid_get_raw_report count mismatches

The previous memcpy implementation relied on the size advertized by the
device. There were no guarantees that buf was big enough.

Some gymnastic is also required with the +2/-2 to take into account
the first 2 bytes of the returned buffer where the total returned
length is supplied by the device.
