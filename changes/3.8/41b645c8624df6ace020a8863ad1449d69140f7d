ALSA: pxa27x: fix ac97 cold reset

Cold reset on the pxa27x currently fails and

     pxa2xx_ac97_try_cold_reset: cold reset timeout (GSR=0x44)

appears in the kernel log.  Through trial-and-error (the pxa270 developer's
manual is mostly incoherent on the topic of ac97 reset), I got cold reset to
complete by setting the WARM_RST bit in the GCR register (and later noticed that
pxa3xx does this for cold reset as well).  Also, a timeout loop is needed to
wait for the reset to complete.

Tested on a palm treo 680 machine.
