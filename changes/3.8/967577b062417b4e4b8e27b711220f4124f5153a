PCI/PM: Keep runtime PM enabled for unbound PCI devices

For unbound PCI devices, what we need is:

 - Always in D0 state, because some devices do not work again after
   being put into D3 by the PCI bus.

 - In SUSPENDED state if allowed, so that the parent devices can still
   be put into low power state.

To satisfy these requirements, the runtime PM for the unbound PCI
devices are disabled and set to SUSPENDED state.  One issue of this
solution is that the PCI devices will be put into SUSPENDED state even
if the SUSPENDED state is forbidden via the sysfs interface
(.../power/control) of the device.  This is not an issue for most
devices, because most PCI devices are not used at all if unbound.
But there are exceptions.  For example, unbound VGA card can be used
for display, but suspending its parents makes it stop working.

To fix the issue, we keep the runtime PM enabled when the PCI devices
are unbound.  But the runtime PM callbacks will do nothing if the PCI
devices are unbound.  This way, we can put the PCI devices into
SUSPENDED state without putting the PCI devices into D3 state.
