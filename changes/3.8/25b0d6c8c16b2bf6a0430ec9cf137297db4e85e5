drbd: Reinstate disabling AL updates with invalidate-remote

Commit d0ef827e (drbd: switch configuration interface from connector to
genetlink) introduced a regression by removing the ability to set all
bits in the out of sync bitmap and to suspend updates to the activity log
of a disconnected device via the invalidate-remote management call.

Credits for reporting the issue are going to Arne Redlich.
