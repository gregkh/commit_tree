drbd: fix potential list_add corruption

If the md_sync_timer triggers a second time,
while the work queued during the first time is still pending,
this could result in list_add() of an already added item,
and corrupt the work item list.

This likely only triggered because of the erroneous
batch-dequeueing of work items fixed with
  drbd: dequeue single work items in wait_for_work()

Still, skip queueing if md_sync_work is already queued.
