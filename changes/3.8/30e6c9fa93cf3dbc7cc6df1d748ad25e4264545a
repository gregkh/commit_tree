net: devnet_rename_seq should be a seqcount

Using a seqlock for devnet_rename_seq is not a good idea,
as device_rename() can sleep.

As we hold RTNL, we dont need a protection for writers,
and only need a seqcount so that readers can catch a change done
by a writer.

Bug added in commit c91f6df2db4972d3 (sockopt: Change getsockopt() of
SO_BINDTODEVICE to return an interface name)
