skb: api to report errors for zero copy skbs

Orphaning frags for zero copy skbs needs to allocate data in atomic
context so is has a chance to fail. If it does we currently discard
the skb which is safe, but we don't report anything to the caller,
so it can not recover by e.g. disabling zero copy.

Add an API to free skb reporting such errors: this is used
by tun in case orphaning frags fails.
