mm: mempolicy: Hide MPOL_NOOP and MPOL_MF_LAZY from userspace for now

The use of MPOL_NOOP and MPOL_MF_LAZY to allow an application to
explicitly request lazy migration is a good idea but the actual
API has not been well reviewed and once released we have to support it.
For now this patch prevents an application using the services. This
will need to be revisited.
