cifs: fix SID binary to string conversion

The authority fields are supposed to be represented by a single 48-bit
value. It's also supposed to represent the value as hex if it's equal to
or greater than 2^32. This is documented in MS-DTYP, section 2.4.2.1.

Also, fix up the max string length to account for this fix.
