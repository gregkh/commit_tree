Btrfs: bring back balance pause/resume logic

Balance pause/resume logic got broken by 5ac00add (went in into 3.8-rc1
as part of dev-replace merge).  Offending commit took a stab at making
mutually exclusive volume operations (add_dev, rm_dev, resize, balance,
replace_dev) not block behind volume_mutex if another such operation is
in progress and instead return an error right away.  Balancing front-end
relied on the blocking behaviour, so the fix is ugly, but short of a
complete rework, it's the best we can do.
