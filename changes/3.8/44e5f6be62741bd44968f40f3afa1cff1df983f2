KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add a mechanism for recording modified HPTEs

This uses a bit in our record of the guest view of the HPTE to record
when the HPTE gets modified.  We use a reserved bit for this, and ensure
that this bit is always cleared in HPTE values returned to the guest.

The recording of modified HPTEs is only done if other code indicates
its interest by setting kvm->arch.hpte_mod_interest to a non-zero value.
The reason for this is that when later commits add facilities for
userspace to read the HPT, the first pass of reading the HPT will be
quicker if there are no (or very few) HPTEs marked as modified,
rather than having most HPTEs marked as modified.
