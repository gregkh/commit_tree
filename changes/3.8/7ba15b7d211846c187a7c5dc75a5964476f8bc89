Btrfs: add two more find_device() methods

The new function btrfs_find_device_missing_or_by_path() will be
used for the device replace procedure. This function itself calls
the second new function btrfs_find_device_by_path().
Unfortunately, it is not possible to currently make the rest of the
code use these functions as well, since all functions that look
similar at first view are all a little bit different in what they
are doing. But in the future, new code could benefit from these
two new functions, and currently, device replace uses them.
