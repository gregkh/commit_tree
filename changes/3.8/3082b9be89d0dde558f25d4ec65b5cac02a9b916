brcmfmac: make pointer type constant in brcmf_set_management_ie()

The vendor ie buffer passed to brcmf_set_management_ie() is not modified
and the caller always provided a constant buffer, which needed a cast.
Better making the buffer parameter of the function constant so the
casts can be removed.
