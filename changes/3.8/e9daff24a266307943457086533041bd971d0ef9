Revert "xen PVonHVM: use E820_Reserved area for shared_info"

This reverts commit 9d02b43dee0d7fb18dfb13a00915550b1a3daa9f.

We are doing this b/c on 32-bit PVonHVM with older hypervisors
(Xen 4.1) it ends up bothing up the start_info. This is bad b/c
we use it for the time keeping, and the timekeeping code loops
forever - as the version field never changes. Olaf says to
revert it, so lets do that.
