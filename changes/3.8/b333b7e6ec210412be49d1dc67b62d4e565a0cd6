6lowpan: consider checksum bytes in fragmentation threshold

Change the threshold for framentation of a lowpan packet from
using the MTU size to now use the MTU size minus the checksum length,
which is added by the hardware. For IEEE 802.15.4, this effectively
changes it from 127 bytes to 125 bytes.
