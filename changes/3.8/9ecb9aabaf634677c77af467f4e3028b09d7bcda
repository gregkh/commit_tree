r8169: workaround for missing extended GigaMAC registers

GigaMAC registers have been reported left unitialized in several
situations:
- after cold boot from power-off state
- after S3 resume

Tweaking rtl_hw_phy_config takes care of both.

This patch removes an excess entry (",") at the end of the exgmac_reg
array as well.
