KVM: Fix user memslot overlap check

Prior to memory slot sorting this loop compared all of the user memory
slots for overlap with new entries.  With memory slot sorting, we're
just checking some number of entries in the array that may or may not
be user slots.  Instead, walk all the slots with kvm_for_each_memslot,
which has the added benefit of terminating early when we hit the first
empty slot, and skip comparison to private slots.
