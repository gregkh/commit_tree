cgroup: remove subsystem files when remounting cgroup

cgroup_clear_directroy is called by cgroup_d_remove_dir
and cgroup_remount.

when we call cgroup_remount to remount the cgroup,the subsystem
may be unlinked from cgroupfs_root->subsys_list in rebind_subsystem,this
subsystem's files will not be removed in cgroup_clear_directroy.
And the system will panic when we try to access these files.

this patch removes subsystems's files before rebind_subsystems,
if rebind_subsystems failed, repopulate these removed files.

With help from Tejun.
