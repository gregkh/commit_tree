Bluetooth: Fix sending HCI commands after reset

After sending reset command wait for its command complete event before
sending next command. Some chips sends CC event for command received
before reset if reset was send before chip replied with CC.

This is also required by specification that host shall not send
additional HCI commands before receiving CC for reset.

< HCI Command: Reset (0x03|0x0003) plen 0                              [hci0] 18.404612
