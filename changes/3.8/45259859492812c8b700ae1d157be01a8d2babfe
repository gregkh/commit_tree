iio: at91_adc: Use devm_kcalloc to allocate arrays

Use dev_kcalloc instead of devm_kzalloc to allocate arrays since it is
semantically more appropriate.

While we are at it the patch also fixes the following coccinelle warning:
	drivers/iio/adc/at91_adc.c:277:25-31: ERROR: application of sizeof to pointer
