md: Update checkpoint of resync/recovery based on time.

md will current only only checkpoint recovery or resync ever 1/16th
of the device size.  As devices get larger this can become a long time
an so a lot of work that might need to be duplicated after a shutdown.

So add a time-based checkpoint.  Every 5 minutes limits the amount of
duplicated effort to at most 5 minutes, and has almost zero impact on
performance.
