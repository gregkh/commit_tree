PM / devfreq: Core updates to support devices which can idle

Prepare devfreq core framework to support devices which
can idle. When device idleness is detected perhaps through
runtime-pm, need some mechanism to suspend devfreq load
monitoring and resume back when device is online. Present
code continues monitoring unless device is removed from
devfreq core.

This patch introduces following design changes,

 - use per device work instead of global work to monitor device
   load. This enables suspend/resume of device devfreq and
   reduces monitoring code complexity.
 - decouple delayed work based load monitoring logic from core
   by introducing helpers functions to be used by governors. This
   provides flexibility for governors either to use delayed work
   based monitoring functions or to implement their own mechanism.
 - devfreq core interacts with governors via events to perform
   specific actions. These events include start/stop devfreq.
   This sets ground for adding suspend/resume events.

The devfreq apis are not modified and are kept intact.
