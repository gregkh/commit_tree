ARM: OMAP2+: Add device-tree support for 32kHz counter

For OMAP devices, the 32kHz counter is the default clock-source for the kernel.
However, this is not the only possible clock-source the kernel can use for OMAP
devices.

When booting with device-tree, if the 32kHz counter is the desired clock-source
for the kernel, then parse the device-tree blob to ensure that the counter is
present and if so map memory for the counter using the device-tree of_iomap()
function so we are no longer reliant on the OMAP HWMOD framework to do this for
us.
