drm/i915: Borrow our struct_mutex for the direct reclaim

If we have hit oom whilst holding our struct_mutex, then currently we
cannot reap our own GPU buffers which likely pin most of memory, making
an outright OOM more likely. So if we are running in direct reclaim and
already hold the mutex, attempt to free buffers knowing that the
original function can not continue until we return.

v2: Add a note explaining that the mutex may be stolen due to
pre-emption, and that is bad.
