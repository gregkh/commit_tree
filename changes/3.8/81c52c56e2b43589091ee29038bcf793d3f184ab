KVM: do not treat noslot pfn as a error pfn

This patch filters noslot pfn out from error pfns based on Marcelo comment:
noslot pfn is not a error pfn

After this patch,
- is_noslot_pfn indicates that the gfn is not in slot
- is_error_pfn indicates that the gfn is in slot but the error is occurred
  when translate the gfn to pfn
- is_error_noslot_pfn indicates that the pfn either it is error pfns or it
  is noslot pfn
And is_invalid_pfn can be removed, it makes the code more clean
