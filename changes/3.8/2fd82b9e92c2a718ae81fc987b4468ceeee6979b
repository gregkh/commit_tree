rbd: get rid of RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN

RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN represents the maximum length of an rbd object
name (i.e., one of the objects providing storage backing an rbd
image).

Another symbol, MAX_OBJ_NAME_SIZE, is used in the osd client code to
define the maximum length of any object name in an osd request.

Right now they disagree, with RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN being too big.

There's no real benefit at this point to defining the rbd object
name length limit separate from any other object name, so just
get rid of RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN and use MAX_OBJ_NAME_SIZE in its
place.
