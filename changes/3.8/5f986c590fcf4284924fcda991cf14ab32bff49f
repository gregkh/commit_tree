PM / QoS: Prepare device structure for adding more constraint types

Currently struct dev_pm_info contains only one PM QoS constraints
pointer reserved for latency requirements.  Since one more device
constraints type (i.e. flags) will be necessary, introduce a new
structure, struct dev_pm_qos, that eventually will contain all of
the available device PM QoS constraints and replace the "constraints"
pointer in struct dev_pm_info with a pointer to the new structure
called "qos".
