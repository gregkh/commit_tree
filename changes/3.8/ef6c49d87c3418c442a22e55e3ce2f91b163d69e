IB/srp: Eliminate state SRP_TARGET_DEAD

Only queue removal work after having changed the target state
into SRP_TARGET_REMOVED and not if that state was already equal
to SRP_TARGET_REMOVED.  That allows us to remove the state
SRP_TARGET_DEAD.  Add a call to srp_disconnect_target() in
srp_remove_target() -- due to previous changes it is now safe to
invoke that function even if the IB connection has already
been disconnected.  This change allows us to replace the target
removal code in srp_remove_one() by an (indirect) call to
srp_remove_target().  Rename srp_target_port.work into
srp_target_port.remove_work to reflect its usage.
