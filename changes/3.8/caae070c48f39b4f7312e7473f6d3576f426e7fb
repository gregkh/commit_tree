spi: Dont call master->setup if not populated

Currently the master->setup() is called unconditionally.
The assumption is that every driver need to implement this
callback. This encourages drivers to populate empty functions
to prevent crashing.

This patch prevents the call of master->setup() if it is not
populated.
