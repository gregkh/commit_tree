IB/mlx4: Fix spinlock order to avoid lockdep warnings

lockdep warns about taking a hard-irq-unsafe lock (sriov->id_map_lock)
inside a hard-irq-safe lock (sriov->going_down_lock).

Since id_map_lock is never taken in the interrupt context, we can
simply reverse the order of taking the two spinlocks, thus avoiding
the warning and the depencency.
