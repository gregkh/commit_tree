Bluetooth: Do not retransmit data during a channel move

Do not retransmit previously-sent data when a "receiver ready" s-frame
with the "final" flag is received during a move.

The ERTM state machines will resynchronize at the end of a channel
move, and the state machine needs to avoid state changes during a
move.
