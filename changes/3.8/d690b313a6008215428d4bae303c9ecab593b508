ARM: S5P64X0: Add I2S clkdev support

I2S controller has an internal mux for RCLK source clk. The list
of source clk names were passed through platform data in non-dt case.
Register the existing RCLK source clocks with clkdev using generic
connection id. This is required as part of adding DT support
for I2S controller driver.
