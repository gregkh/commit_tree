xen: balloon: allow PVMMU interfaces to be compiled out

The ARM platform has no concept of PVMMU and therefor no
HYPERVISOR_update_va_mapping et al. Allow this code to be compiled out
when not required.

In some similar situations (e.g. P2M) we have defined dummy functions
to avoid this, however I think we can/should draw the line at dummying
out actual hypercalls.
