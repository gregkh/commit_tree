Thermal: Update binding logic based on platform data

This patch updates the binding logic in thermal_sys.c
It uses the platform layer data to bind a thermal zone
to a cdev for a particular trip point.

 * If we do not have platform data and do not have
   .bind defined, do not bind.
 * If we do not have platform data but .bind is
   defined, then use tz->ops->bind.
 * If we have platform data, use it to create binding.

The same logic sequence is followed for unbind also.
