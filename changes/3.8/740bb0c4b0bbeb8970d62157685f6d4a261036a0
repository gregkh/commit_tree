mtd: mxc_nand: reorder part_probes to let cmdline override other sources

The cmdline is the easiest to change source of information. Thus
let it take precedence over 'RedBoot' and 'ofpart'. This makes the
mxc_nand driver to be in sync with all other NAND drivers that support
'cmdlinepart' partition parsing.

Also change 'const char *' to 'const char const *' as advised by checkpatch.pl
