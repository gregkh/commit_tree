mm: numa: Introduce last_nid to the page frame

This patch introduces a last_nid field to the page struct. This is used
to build a two-stage filter in the next patch that is aimed at
mitigating a problem whereby pages migrate to the wrong node when
referenced by a process that was running off its home node.
