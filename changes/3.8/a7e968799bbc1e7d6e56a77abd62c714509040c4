mmc: omap_hsmmc: Cleanup bitmap definitions of Interrupt Register

Define the most frequently used bitmasks of the Interrupt Enable /
Interrupt Status register with consistent naming ( with _EN suffix).

Use meaningful concatenation of bitfields for INT_EN_MASK, which shows
which interrupts are enabled by default.  No functional changes.
