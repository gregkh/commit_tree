powerpc: Enable relocation on during exceptions at boot

We currently do this synchronously at boot from setup_arch. On a large
system this could hypothetically take a little while to complete, so
currently we will give up if we are asked to wait for more than a second
in total.

If we actually start hitting that timeout in practice we can always move
this code into a kernel thread to take care of it in the background.
