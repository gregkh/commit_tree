ia64: kill thread_matches(), unexport ptrace_check_attach()

The ia64 function "thread_matches()" has no users since commit
e868a55c2a8c ("[IA64] remove find_thread_for_addr()").  Remove it.

This allows us to make ptrace_check_attach() static to kernel/ptrace.c,
which is good since we'll need to change the semantics of it and fix up
all the callers.
