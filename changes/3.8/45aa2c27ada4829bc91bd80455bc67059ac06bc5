clk: Add support for fundamental zynq clks

Provide simplified models for the necessary clocks on the zynq-7000
platform.  Currently, the PLLs, the CPU clock network, and the basic
peripheral clock networks (for SDIO, SMC, SPI, QSPI, UART) are modelled.

OF bindings are also provided and documented.
