rbd: drop rbd_do_op() opcode and flags

The only callers of rbd_do_op() are in rbd_rq_fn(), where call one
is used for writes and the other used for reads.  The request passed
to rbd_do_op() already encodes the I/O direction, and that
information can be used inside the function to set the opcode and
flags value (rather than passing them in as arguments).

So get rid of the opcode and flags arguments to rbd_do_op().
