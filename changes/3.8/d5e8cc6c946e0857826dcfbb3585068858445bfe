sfc: Really disable flow control while flushing

Receiving pause frames can block TX queue flushes.  Earlier changes
work around this by reconfiguring the MAC during flushes for VFs, but
during flushes for the PF we would only change the fc_disable counter.
Unless the MAC is reconfigured for some other reason during the flush
(which I would not expect to happen) this had no effect at all.
