ARM: hw_breakpoint: check if monitor mode is enabled during validation

Rather than attempt to enable monitor mode explicitly when scheduling in
a breakpoint event (which could raise an undefined exception trap when
accessing DBGDSCRext), instead check that DBGDSCRint.MDBGen is set
during event validation and report an error to the caller if not.
