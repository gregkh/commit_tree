ARM: imx: disable cpu in .cpu_kill hook

It's buggy to disable the cpu that is being hot-unplugged in .cpu_die
hook which runs on the cpu itself.  Instead, it should be done in
.cpu_kill which runs on the thread (another cpu) that asks for shutting
down the cpu.  Move imx_enable_cpu(cpu, false) call into .cpu_kill
hook, and leave the cpu to be hot-unplugged in WFI within .cpu_die,
so that we can get a more stable cpu hot-plug operation.
