regulator: max8998: fix incorrect min_uV value for ldo10

Correct value for minimal voltage for ldo10 output is 950000 uV. This
patch fixes the typo introduced by patch adf6178ad5552a7f2f742a8c85343c50
("regulator: max8998: Use uV in voltage_map_desc"), what solves broken
probe of max8998 in v3.8-rc4.
