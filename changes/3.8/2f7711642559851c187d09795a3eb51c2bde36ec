usb: musb: remove hand-crafted id handling

This replaced the handcrafted id handling by the PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO
value which should do the same thing.

This patch probably also fixes ux500 because I did not find the "musbid"
variable to remove. And we close a tiny-unlikely race window becuase the
old code gave the id back before device was destroyed in the remove
case.
