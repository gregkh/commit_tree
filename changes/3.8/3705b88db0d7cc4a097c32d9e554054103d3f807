rcu: Add a module parameter to force use of expedited RCU primitives

There have been some embedded applications that would benefit from
use of expedited grace-period primitives.  In some ways, this is
similar to synchronize_net() doing either a normal or an expedited
grace period depending on lock state, but with control outside of
the kernel.

This commit therefore adds rcu_expedited boot and sysfs parameters
that cause the kernel to substitute expedited primitives for the
normal grace-period primitives.

[ paulmck: Add trace/event/rcu.h to kernel/srcu.c to avoid build error.
	   Get rid of infinite loop through contention path.]
