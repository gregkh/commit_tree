autofs4 - dont clear DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT on rootless mount

The DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT flag is cleared on mount and set on expire
for autofs rootless multi-mount dentrys to prevent unnecessary calls
to ->d_automount().

Since DCACHE_MANAGE_TRANSIT is always set on autofs dentrys ->d_managed()
is always called so the check can be done in ->d_manage() without the
need to change the flag. This still avoids unnecessary calls to
->d_automount(), adds negligible overhead and eliminates a seriously
ugly check in the expire code.
