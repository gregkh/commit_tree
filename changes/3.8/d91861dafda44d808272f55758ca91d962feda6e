pwm: pwm-tiehrpwm: Adding TBCLK gating support.

Some platforms (like AM33XX) requires clock gating from control module
explicitly for TBCLK. Enabling of this clock required for the
functioning of the time base sub module in EHRPWM module. Adding support
for handling by enabling the clock on PWM device enable & disable on PWM
device disable. Platforms don't have explicit TBCLK gating has to add
dummy TBCLK node.
