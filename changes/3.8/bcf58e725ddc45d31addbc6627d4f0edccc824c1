userns: Make create_new_namespaces take a user_ns parameter

Modify create_new_namespaces to explicitly take a user namespace
parameter, instead of implicitly through the task_struct.

This allows an implementation of unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER) where
the new user namespace is not stored onto the current task_struct
until after all of the namespaces are created.
