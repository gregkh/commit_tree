pidns: Add setns support

- Pid namespaces are designed to be inescapable so verify that the
  passed in pid namespace is a child of the currently active
  pid namespace or the currently active pid namespace itself.

  Allowing the currently active pid namespace is important so
  the effects of an earlier setns can be cancelled.
