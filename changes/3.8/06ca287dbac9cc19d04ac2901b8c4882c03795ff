virtio: move queue_index and num_free fields into core struct virtqueue.

They're generic concepts, so hoist them.  This also avoids accessor
functions (though kept around for merge with DaveM's net tree).

This goes even further than Jason Wang's 17bb6d4088 patch
("virtio-ring: move queue_index to vring_virtqueue") which moved the
queue_index from the specific transport.
