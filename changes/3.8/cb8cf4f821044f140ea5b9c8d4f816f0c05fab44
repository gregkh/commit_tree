ARM: kernel: smp_setup_processor_id() updates

This patch applies some basic changes to the smp_setup_processor_id()
ARM implementation to make the code that builds cpu_logical_map more
uniform across the kernel.

The function now prints the full extent of the boot CPU MPIDR[23:0] and
initializes the cpu_logical_map for CPUs up to nr_cpu_ids.
