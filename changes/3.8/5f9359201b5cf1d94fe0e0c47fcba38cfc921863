drbd: Make drbd's use of netlink attribute flags less confusing

Make it more clear in the flag names which flags are internal to drbd, and
which are not.

The check for mandatory attributes is the only extension visible at the netlink
layer.  Attributes with this flag set would look like unknown attributes to
some kernel versions.  The netlink layer would ignore them and also skip
consistency checks on the attribute type and legth.  To avoid this, we check
for mandatory attributes first, remove the mandatory flag, and then process the
attributes normally.
