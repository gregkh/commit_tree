ext4: fix configuration dependencies for ext4 ACLs and security labels

Commit "ext4: Remove CONFIG_EXT4_FS_XATTR" removed the configuration
dependencies for ext4 xattrs from the ext4 ACLs and security labels
configuration options, but did not replace them with a dependency on
ext4 itself.  Add back the dependency on ext4 so the options only show
up if ext4 is enabled.
