rcu: Fix precedence error in cpu_needs_another_gp()

The fix introduced by a10d206e (rcu: Fix day-one dyntick-idle
stall-warning bug) has a C-language precedence error.  It turns out
that this error is harmless in that the same result is computed for all
inputs, but the code is nevertheless a potential source of confusion.
This commit therefore introduces parentheses in order to force the
execution of the code to reflect the intent.
