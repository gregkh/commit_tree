ALSA: usb-audio: use sender stride for implicit feedback

For implicit feedback endpoints, the number of bytes for each packet
is matched by the corresponding synchronizing endpoint.
The size is calculated by taking the actual size and dividing it by
the stride - currently by the endpoint's stride, but we should use the
synchronization source's stride.
This is evident when the number of channels differ between the
synchronization source and the implicitly fed-back endpoint, as with
M-Audio Fast Track C400 - the synchronization source (capture)
has 4 channels, while the implicit feedback mode endpoint has 6.
