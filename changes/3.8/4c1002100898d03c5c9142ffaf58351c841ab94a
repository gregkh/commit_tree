nfs: Fix wrong slab cache in nfs_commit_mempool

The slab cache in nfs_commit_mempool is wrong, and I think it is just a slip.
I tested it on a x86-32 machine, the size of nfs_write_header is 544, and
the size of nfs_commit_data is 408, so it works fine. It is also true that
sizeof(struct nfs_write_header) > sizeof(struct nfs_commit_data) on other
platforms in my opinoin. Just fix it.
