perf script: Add more filter to find_scripts()

As suggested by Arnaldo, many scripts have their own usages and need
capture specific events or tracepoints, so only those scripts whose
target events match the events in current perf data file should be
listed in the script browser menu.

This patch will add the event match checking, by opening "xxx-record"
script to cherry pick out all events name and comparing them with
those inside the perf data file.
