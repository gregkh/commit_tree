rbd: remove snapshots on error in rbd_add()

If rbd_dev_snaps_update() has ever been called for an rbd device
structure there could be snapshot structures on its snaps list.
In rbd_add(), this function is called but a subsequent error
path neglected to clean up any of these snapshots.

Add a call to rbd_remove_all_snaps() in the appropriate spot to
remedy this.  Change a couple of error labels to be a little
clearer while there.

Drop the leading underscores from the function name; there's nothing
special about that function that they might signify.  As suggested
in review, the leading underscores in __rbd_remove_snap_dev() have
been removed as well.
