sched: numa: ksm: fix oops in task_numa_placment()

task_numa_placement() oopsed on NULL p->mm when task_numa_fault() got
called in the handling of break_ksm() for ksmd.  That might be a
peculiar case, which perhaps KSM could takes steps to avoid? but it's
more robust if task_numa_placement() allows for such a possibility.
