drm/exynos: remove 'pages' and 'page_size' elements in exynos gem buffer

Changelog v2:

Removed redundant check for invalid sgl.
Added check for valid page_offset in the beginning of exynos_drm_gem_map_buf.

Changelog v1:

The 'pages' structure is not required since we can use the 'sgt'. Even for
CONTIG buffers, a SGT is created (which will have just one sgl). This SGT
can be used during mmap instead of 'pages'. The 'page_size' element of the
structure is also not used anywhere and is removed.
This patch also fixes a memory leak where the 'pages' structure was being
allocated during gem buffer allocation but not being freed during deallocate.
