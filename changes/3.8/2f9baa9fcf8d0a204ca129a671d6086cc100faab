slab: Use the new create_boot_cache function to simplify bootstrap

Simplify setup and reduce code in kmem_cache_init(). This allows us to
get rid of initarray_cache as well as the manual setup code for
the kmem_cache and kmem_cache_node arrays during bootstrap.

We introduce a new bootstrap state "PARTIAL" for slab that signals the
creation of a kmem_cache boot cache.
