KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: MSR_DE doesn't exist on Book 3S

The mask of MSR bits that get transferred from the guest MSR to the
shadow MSR included MSR_DE.  In fact that bit only exists on Book 3E
processors, and it is assigned the same bit used for MSR_BE on Book 3S
processors.  Since we already had MSR_BE in the mask, this just removes
MSR_DE.
