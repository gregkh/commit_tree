rcu: Prevent soft-lockup complaints about no-CBs CPUs

The wait_event() at the head of the rcu_nocb_kthread() can result in
soft-lockup complaints if the CPU in question does not register RCU
callbacks for an extended period.  This commit therefore changes
the wait_event() to a wait_event_interruptible().
