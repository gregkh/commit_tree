btrfs: fix btrfs_cont_expand() freeing IS_ERR em

btrfs_cont_expand() tries to free an IS_ERR em as it gets an error from
btrfs_get_extent() and breaks out of its loop.

An instance of -EEXIST was reported in the wild:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=874407

I have no idea if that -EEXIST is surprising, or not.  Regardless, this
error handling should be cleaned up to handle other reasonable errors
(ENOMEM, EIO; whatever).

This seemed to be the only buggy freeing of the relatively rare IS_ERR
em so I opted to fix the caller rather than teach free_extent_map() to
use IS_ERR_OR_NULL().
