net: xfrm: use __this_cpu_read per-cpu helper

this_cpu_ptr/this_cpu_read is faster than per_cpu_ptr(p, smp_processor_id())
and can reduce  memory accesses.
The latter helper needs to find the offset for current cpu,
and needs more assembler instructions which objdump shows in following.

this_cpu_ptr relocates and address. this_cpu_read() relocates the address
and performs the fetch. this_cpu_read() saves you more instructions
since it can do the relocation and the fetch in one instruction.
