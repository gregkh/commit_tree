tuntap: reduce memory using of queues

A MAX_TAP_QUEUES(1024) queues of tuntap device is always allocated
unconditionally even userspace only requires a single queue device. This is
unnecessary and will lead a very high order of page allocation when has a high
possibility to fail. Solving this by creating a one queue net device when
userspace only use one queue and also reduce MAX_TAP_QUEUES to
DEFAULT_MAX_NUM_RSS_QUEUES which can guarantee the success of
the allocation.
