mmc: omap_hsmmc: Enable HSPE bit for high speed cards

HSMMC IP on AM33xx need a special setting to handle High-speed cards.
Other platforms like TI81xx, OMAP4 may need this as-well. This depends
on the HSMMC IP timing closure done for the high speed cards.

From AM335x TRM (SPRUH73F - 18.3.12 Output Signals Generation):

The MMC/SD/SDIO output signals can be driven on either falling edge or
rising edge depending on the SD_HCTL[2] HSPE bit. This feature allows
to reach better timing performance, and thus to increase data transfer
frequency.

There are few pre-requisites for enabling the HSPE bit
- Controller should support High-Speed-Enable Bit and
- Controller should not be using DDR Mode and
- Controller should advertise that it supports High Speed in
  capabilities register and
- MMC/SD clock coming out of controller > 25MHz
