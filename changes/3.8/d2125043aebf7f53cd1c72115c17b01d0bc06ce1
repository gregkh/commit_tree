generic sys_fork / sys_vfork / sys_clone

... and get rid of idiotic struct pt_regs * in asm-generic/syscalls.h
prototypes of the same, while we are at it.  Eventually we want those
in linux/syscalls.h, of course, but that'll have to wait a bit.

Note that there are *three* variants of sys_clone() order of arguments.
Braindamage galore...
