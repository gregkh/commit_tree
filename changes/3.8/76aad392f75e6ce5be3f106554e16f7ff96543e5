regmap: introduce tables for readable/writeable/volatile/precious checks

Many of the regmap enabled drivers implementing one or more of the
readable, writeable, volatile and precious methods use the same code
pattern:

	return ((reg >= X && reg <= Y) || (reg >= W && reg <= Z) || ...)

Switch to a data driven approach, using tables to describe
readable/writeable/volatile and precious registers ranges instead.
The table based check can still be overridden by passing the usual function
pointers via struct regmap_config.
