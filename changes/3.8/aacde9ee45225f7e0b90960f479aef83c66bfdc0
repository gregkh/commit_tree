    mac80211: Optimize scans on current operating channel.

we do not disable PS while going back to operational channel (on
ieee80211_scan_state_suspend) and deffer that until scan finish.
But since we are allowed to send frames, we can send a frame to AP
without PM bit set, so disable PS on AP side. Then when we switch
to off-channel (in ieee80211_scan_state_resume) we do not enable PS.
Hence we are off-channel with PS disabled, frames are not buffered
by AP.

To fix remove offchannel_ps_disable argument and always enable PS when
going off-channel and disable it when going on-channel, like it was
before.
