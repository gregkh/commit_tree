mfd: da9052/53 lockup fix

An issue has been reported where the PMIC either locks up or fails to
respond following a system Reset. This could result in a second write
in which the bus writes the current content of the write buffer to address
of the last I2C access.

The failure case is where this unwanted write transfers incorrect data to
a critical register.

This patch fixes this issue to by following any read or write with a dummy read
to a safe register address. A safe register address is one where the contents
will not affect the operation of the system.
