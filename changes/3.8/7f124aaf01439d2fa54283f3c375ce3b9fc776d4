ARM: kernel: add logical mappings look-up

In ARM SMP systems the MPIDR register ([23:0] bits) is used to uniquely
identify CPUs.

In order to retrieve the logical CPU index corresponding to a given
MPIDR value and guarantee a consistent translation throughout the kernel,
this patch adds a look-up based on the MPIDR[23:0] so that kernel subsystems
can use it whenever the logical cpu index corresponding to a given MPIDR
value is needed.
