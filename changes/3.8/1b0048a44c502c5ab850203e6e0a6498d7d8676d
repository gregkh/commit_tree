rcu: Make rcu_nocb_poll an early_param instead of module_param

The as-documented rcu_nocb_poll will fail to enable this feature
for two reasons.  (1) there is an extra "s" in the documented
name which is not in the code, and (2) since it uses module_param,
it really is expecting a prefix, akin to "rcutree.fanout_leaf"
and the prefix isn't documented.

However, there are several reasons why we might not want to
simply fix the typo and add the prefix:

1) we'd end up with rcutree.rcu_nocb_poll, and rather probably make
a change to rcutree.nocb_poll

2) if we did #1, then the prefix wouldn't be consistent with the
rcu_nocbs=<cpumap> parameter (i.e. one with, one without prefix)

3) the use of module_param in a header file is less than desired,
since it isn't immediately obvious that it will get processed
via rcutree.c and get the prefix from that (although use of
module_param_named() could clarify that.)

4) the implied export of /sys/module/rcutree/parameters/rcu_nocb_poll
data to userspace via module_param() doesn't really buy us anything,
as it is read-only and we can tell if it is enabled already without
it, since there is a printk at early boot telling us so.

In light of all that, just change it from a module_param() to an
early_setup() call, and worry about adding it to /sys later on if
we decide to allow a dynamic setting of it.

Also change the variable to be tagged as read_mostly, since it
will only ever be fiddled with at most, once at boot.
