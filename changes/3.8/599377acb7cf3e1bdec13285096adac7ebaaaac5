drbd: Avoid NetworkFailure state during disconnect

Disconnecting is a cluster wide state change. In case the peer node agrees
to the state transition, it sends back the fact on the meta-data connection
and closes both sockets.

In case the node node that initiated the state transfer sees the closing
action on the data-socket, before the P_STATE_CHG_REPLY packet, it was
going into one of the network failure states.

At least with the fencing option set to something else thatn "dont-care",
the unclean shutdown of the connection causes a short IO freeze or
a fence operation.
