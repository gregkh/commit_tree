drbd: disambiguation, s/ERR_DISCARD/ERR_DISCARD_IMPOSSIBLE/

If for some reason (typically "split-brained" cluster manager)
drbd replica data has diverged, we can chose a victim,
and reconnect using "--discard-my-data", causing the victim
to become sync-target, fetching all changed blocks from the peer.

If we are Primary, we are potentially in use, and we refuse to
"roll back" changes to the data below the page cache and other users.

Rename the error symbol for this to ERR_DISCARD_IMPOSSIBLE.
