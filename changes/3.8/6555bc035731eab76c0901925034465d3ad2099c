mm: do not call frontswap_init() during swapoff

The call to frontswap_init() was added within enable_swap_info(), which
was called not only during sys_swapon, but also to reinsert the swap_info
into the swap_list in case of failure of try_to_unuse() within
sys_swapoff.  This means that frontswap_init() might be called more than
once for the same swap area.

While as far as I could see no frontswap implementation has any problem
with it (and in fact, all the ones I found ignore the parameter passed to
frontswap_init), this could change in the future.

To prevent future problems, move the call to frontswap_init() to outside
the code shared between sys_swapon and sys_swapoff.
