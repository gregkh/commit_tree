ALSA: hda - Add missing verb applications in patch_cirrus.c

We forgot to apply the fixup verbs in cs_init().

But adding the fixup verbs will break mbp101 fixup that has been fixed
recently again, since the mbp101 fixup contains the wrong verbs to
override.  So these bogus verbs must be removed, too.
