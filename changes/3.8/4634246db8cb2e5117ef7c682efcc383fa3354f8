rbd: consolidate rbd_do_op() calls

The two calls to rbd_do_op() from rbd_rq_fn() differ only in the
value passed for the snapshot id and the snapshot context.

For reads the snapshot always comes from the mapping, and for writes
the snapshot id is always CEPH_NOSNAP.

The snapshot context is always null for reads.  For writes, the
snapshot context always comes from the rbd header, but it is
acquired under protection of header semaphore and could change
thereafter, so we can't simply use what's available inside
rbd_do_op().

Eliminate the snapid parameter from rbd_do_op(), and set it
based on the I/O direction inside that function instead.  Always
pass the snapshot context acquired in the caller, but reset it
to a null pointer inside rbd_do_op() if the operation is a read.

As a result, there is no difference in the read and write calls
to rbd_do_op() made in rbd_rq_fn(), so just call it unconditionally.
