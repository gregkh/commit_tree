ARM: mm: introduce present, faulting entries for PAGE_NONE

PROT_NONE mappings apply the page protection attributes defined by _P000
which translate to PAGE_NONE for ARM. These attributes specify an XN,
RDONLY pte that is inaccessible to userspace. However, on kernels
configured without support for domains, such a pte *is* accessible to
the kernel and can be read via get_user, allowing tasks to read
PROT_NONE pages via syscalls such as read/write over a pipe.

This patch introduces a new software pte flag, L_PTE_NONE, that is set
to identify faulting, present entries.
