tracing: Expand ring buffer when trace_printk() is used

Since tracing is not used by 99% of Linux users, even though tracing
may be configured in, it does not make sense to allocate 1.4 Megs
per CPU for the ring buffers if they are not used. Thus, on boot up
the ring buffers are set to a minimal size until something needs the
and they are expanded.

This works well for events and tracers (function, etc), but for the
asynchronous use of trace_printk() which can write to the ring buffer
at any time, does not expand the buffers.

On boot up a check is made to see if any trace_printk() is used to
see if the trace_printk() temp buffer pages should be allocated. This
same code can be used to expand the buffers as well.
