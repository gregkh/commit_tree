igb: remove duplicate code for fallback interrupt initialization

Given a small change to igb_init_interrupt_scheme() the function fits
igb_request_irq() for MSI/legacy interrupts initialization as well, instead of
duplicating most of its code there.

Also adding a missing igb_configure() to igb_request_irq() for MSI fallback
to work properly.
