cgroup: remove CGRP_WAIT_ON_RMDIR, cgroup_exclude_rmdir() and cgroup_release_and_wakeup_rmdir()

CGRP_WAIT_ON_RMDIR is another kludge which was added to make cgroup
destruction rollback somewhat working.  cgroup_rmdir() used to drain
CSS references and CGRP_WAIT_ON_RMDIR and the associated waitqueue and
helpers were used to allow the task performing rmdir to wait for the
next relevant event.

Unfortunately, the wait is visible to controllers too and the
mechanism got exposed to memcg by 887032670d ("cgroup avoid permanent
sleep at rmdir").

Now that the draining and retries are gone, CGRP_WAIT_ON_RMDIR is
unnecessary.  Remove it and all the mechanisms supporting it.  Note
that memcontrol.c changes are essentially revert of 887032670d
("cgroup avoid permanent sleep at rmdir").
