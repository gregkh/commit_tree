dm snapshot: do not use map_context

Eliminate struct map_info from dm-snap.

map_info->ptr was used in dm-snap to indicate if the bio was tracked.
If map_info->ptr was non-NULL, the bio was linked in tracked_chunk_hash.

This patch removes the use of map_info->ptr. We determine if the bio was
tracked based on hlist_unhashed(&c->node). If hlist_unhashed is true,
the bio is not tracked, if it is false, the bio is tracked.
