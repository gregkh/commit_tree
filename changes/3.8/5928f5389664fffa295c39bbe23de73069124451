regulator: max8973: add regulator driver support

The MAXIM MAX8973 high-efficiency, three phase, DC-DC step-down
switching regulator delievers up to 9A of output current. Each
phase operates at a 2MHz fixed frequency with a 120 deg shift
from the adjacent phase, allowing the use of small magnetic
component.

Add regulator driver for this device.
