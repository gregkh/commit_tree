vmxnet3: set carrier state properly on probe

vmxnet3 fails to set netif_carrier_off on probe, meaning that when an interface
is opened the __LINK_STATE_NOCARRIER bit is already cleared, and so
/sys/class/net/<ifname>/operstate remains in the unknown state.  Correct this by
setting netif_carrier_off on probe, like other drivers do.

Also, while we're at it, lets remove the netif_carrier_ok checks from the
link_state_update function, as that check is atomically contained within the
netif_carrier_[on|off] functions anyway
