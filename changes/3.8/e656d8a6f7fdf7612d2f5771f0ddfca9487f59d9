procfs: Use the proc generic infrastructure for proc/self.

I had visions at one point of splitting proc into two filesystems.  If
that had happened proc/self being the the part of proc that actually deals
with pids would have been a nice cleanup.  As it is proc/self requires
a lot of unnecessary infrastructure for a single file.

The only user visible change is that a mounted /proc for a pid namespace
that is dead now shows a broken proc symlink, instead of being completely
invisible.  I don't think anyone will notice or care.
