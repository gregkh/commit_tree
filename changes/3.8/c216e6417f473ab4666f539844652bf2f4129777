cfg80211: change function signature of cfg80211_get_p2p_attr()

The function cfg80211_get_p2p_attr() can fail and returns
a negative error code. However, the return type is unsigned
int. The largest positive number is determined by desired_len
variable in the function, which is u16. So changing the return
type to int to allow easy error checking. Also change the type
for the attribute to enum for improved type checking.
