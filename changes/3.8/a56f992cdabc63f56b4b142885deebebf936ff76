mac80211: use del_timer_sync for final sta cleanup timer deletion

This is a very old bug, but there's nothing that prevents the
timer from running while the module is being removed when we
only do del_timer() instead of del_timer_sync().

The timer should normally not be running at this point, but
it's not clearly impossible (or we could just remove this.)
