ACPI: Make seemingly useless check in osl.c more understandable

There is a seemingly useless check in drivers/acpi/osl.c added by
commit bc73675 (ACPI: fixes a false alarm from lockdep), which really
is necessary to avoid false positive lockdep complaints.  Document
this and rearrange the code related to it so that it makes fewer
checks.
