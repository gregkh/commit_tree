video: mxsfb: fix crash when unblanking the display

The VDCTRL4 register does not provide the MXS SET/CLR/TOGGLE feature.
The write in mxsfb_disable_controller() sets the data_cnt for the LCD
DMA to 0 which obviously means the max. count for the LCD DMA and
leads to overwriting arbitrary memory when the display is unblanked.
