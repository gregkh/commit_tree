ALSA: usb-audio: fix delay account during pause

When a playback stream is paused, the stream isn't actually stopped,
thus we still need to take care of the in-flight data amount for the
delay calculation.  Otherwise the value of subs->last_delay is no
longer reliable and can give a bogus value after resuming from pause.
This will result in "delay: estimated XX, actual YY" error messages.

Also, during pause after all in flight data are processed
(i.e. last_delay = 0), we don't have to calculate the actual delay
from the current frame.  Give a short path in such a case.
