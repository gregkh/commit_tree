nfsd: avoid permission checks on EXCLUSIVE_CREATE replay

With NFSv4, if we create a file then open it we explicit avoid checking
the permissions on the file during the open because the fact that we
created it ensures we should be allow to open it (the create and the
open should appear to be a single operation).

However if the reply to an EXCLUSIVE create gets lots and the client
resends the create, the current code will perform the permission check -
because it doesn't realise that it did the open already..

This patch should fix this.

Note that I haven't actually seen this cause a problem.  I was just
looking at the code trying to figure out a different EXCLUSIVE open
related issue, and this looked wrong.

(Fix confirmed with pynfs 4.0 test OPEN4--bfields)
