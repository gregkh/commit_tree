gpiolib: add gpio get direction callback support

Add .get_direction callback to gpio_chip. This allows gpiolib
to check the current direction of a gpio.
Used to show the correct gpio direction in sysfs and debug entries.

If callback is not set then gpiolib will work as previously;
e.g. guessing everything is input until a direction is set.
