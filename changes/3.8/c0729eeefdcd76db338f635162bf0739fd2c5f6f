staging: comedi: comedi_test: fix race when cancelling command

Éric Piel reported a kernel oops in the "comedi_test" module.  It was a
NULL pointer dereference within `waveform_ai_interrupt()` (actually a
timer function) that sometimes occurred when a running asynchronous
command is cancelled (either by the `COMEDI_CANCEL` ioctl or by closing
the device file).

This seems to be a race between the caller of `waveform_ai_cancel()`
which on return from that function goes and tears down the running
command, and the timer function which uses the command.  In particular,
`async->cmd.chanlist` gets freed (and the pointer set to NULL) by
`do_become_nonbusy()` in "comedi_fops.c" but a previously scheduled
`waveform_ai_interrupt()` timer function will dereference that pointer
regardless, leading to the oops.

Fix it by replacing the `del_timer()` call in `waveform_ai_cancel()`
with `del_timer_sync()`.
