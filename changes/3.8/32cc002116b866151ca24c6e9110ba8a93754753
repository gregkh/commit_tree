ARM: OMAP4: clock: Convert to common clk

Convert all OMAP4 specific platform files to use COMMON clk
and keep all the changes under the CONFIG_COMMON_CLK macro check
so it does not break any existing code. At a later point switch
to COMMON clk and get rid of all old/legacy code.

This converts all apis which will be called directly from COMMON
clk to take a struct clk_hw parameter, and all the internal platform
apis to take a struct clk_hw_omap parameter.

Changes are based off the original patch from Mike Turquette.

[paul@pwsan.com: created new omap2_clksel_find_parent_index() rather than
 modifying omap2_init_clksel_parent(); moved clkhwops_iclk_wait to
 clkt_iclk.c to fix OMAP4-only builds; added clk-provider.h include to clock.h
 to try to fix some 3430-builds]

 omap2_dflt_clk_is_enabled should not enable clocks]
