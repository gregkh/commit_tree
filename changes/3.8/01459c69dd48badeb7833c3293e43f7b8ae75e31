ARM: tegra30: flowctrl: add cpu_suspend_exter/exit function

The flow controller can help CPU to go into suspend mode (powered-down
state). When CPU go into powered-down state, it needs some careful
settings before getting into and after leaving. The enter and exit
functions do that by configuring appropriate mode for flow controller.
