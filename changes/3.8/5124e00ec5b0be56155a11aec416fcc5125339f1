Btrfs: only unlock and relock if we have to

I noticed while doing fsync tests that we were always dropping the path and
re-searching when we first cow the log root even though we've already gotten
the write lock on the root.  That's because we don't take into account that
there might not be a parent node, so fix the check to make sure there is
actually a parent node before we undo all of this work for nothing.  Thanks,
