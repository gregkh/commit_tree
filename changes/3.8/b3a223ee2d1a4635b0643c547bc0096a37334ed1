spi: Remove SPI_BUFSIZ restriction on spi_write_then_read()

In order to avoid constantly allocating and deallocating there is a fixed
buffer which spi_write_then_read() uses for transfers, with an early error
check to ensure that the transfer fits within the buffer. This limits the
size of transfers to this size, currently max(32, SMP_CACHE_BYTES).

Since we can dynamically allocate and in fact already have a fallback
to do so when there is contention for the fixed buffer remove this
restriction and instead dynamically allocate a suitably sized buffer if
the transfer won't fit.
