USB: Increase reset timeout.

John's NEC 0.96 xHCI host controller needs a longer timeout for a warm
reset to complete.  The logs show it takes 650ms to complete the warm
reset, so extend the hub reset timeout to 800ms to be on the safe side.

This commit should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that contain
the commit 75d7cf72ab9fa01dc70877aa5c68e8ef477229dc "usbcore: refine
warm reset logic".
