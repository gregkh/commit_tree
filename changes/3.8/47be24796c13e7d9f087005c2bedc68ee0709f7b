virtio-net: fix the set affinity bug when CPU IDs are not consecutive

As Michael mentioned, set affinity and select queue will not work very
well when CPU IDs are not consecutive, this can happen with hot unplug.
Fix this bug by traversal the online CPUs, and create a per cpu variable
to find the mapping from CPU to the preferable virtual-queue.
