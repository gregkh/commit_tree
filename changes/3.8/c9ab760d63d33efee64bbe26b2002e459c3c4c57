staging: comedi: addi-data: remove special handling for apci1710

Now that the addi_apci_1710 driver is not using addi_common.c we can
remove the CONFIG_APCI_1710 define and all the special handling for
the initialization of it's subdevices.

Also remove the i_ADDIDATA_InsnReadEeprom() function from the
addi_apci_1710 driver. This board does not have an eeprom subdevice
and does not use this function.
