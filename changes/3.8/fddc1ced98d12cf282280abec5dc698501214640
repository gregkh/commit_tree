staging: comedi: hwdrv_apci3200: remove forward declarations

This source file is #include'd when building the addi_apci_3200 and
addi_apci_3300 driver. All the functions in this file are actually
static and should not be exported to the kernel.

Move some of the functions to remove the need for the forward declarations
and make all of the functions in this file static. Note, this patch does
not try to fix any of the coding style issues in the functions.
