Staging: bcm: Reverse condition in if statement in Misc.c

This patch reverses the condition in two if
statements in CopyBufferToControlPacket to
place Adapter->bShutStatus and
Adapter->idleMode to the left of the equal
"==" sign, and TRUE to the right of
the equal "==" sign. This was done for
readability purposes.
