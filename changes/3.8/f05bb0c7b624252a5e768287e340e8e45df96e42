drm/i915: GFX_MODE Flush TLB Invalidate Mode must be '1' for scanline waits

On SNB, if bit 13 of GFX_MODE, Flush TLB Invalidate Mode, is not set to 1,
the hardware can not program the scanline values. Those scanline values
then control when the signal is sent from the display engine to the render
ring for MI_WAIT_FOR_EVENTs. Note setting this bit means that TLB
invalidations must be performed explicitly through the appropriate bits
being set in PIPE_CONTROL.
