drbd: Fix the way the STATE_SENT bit is cleared

With merging the commit
'drbd: Delay/reject other state changes while establishing a connection'
the condition check for clearing the flag was wrong.

Move the bit clearing to the __drbd_set_state() function
in order to have it already cleared for the other parts of
the function. I.e. clearing the susp_fen in the after_state_ch() function.
