Some early GIC implementations return zero for the first distributor
CPU routing register.  This means we can't rely on that telling us
which CPU interface we're connected to.  We know that these platforms
implement PPIs for IRQs 29-31 - but we shouldn't assume that these
will always be populated.

So, instead, scan for a non-zero CPU routing register in the first
32 IRQs and use that as our CPU mask.
