ARM: OMAP2+: CM: prepare for use of cm_ll_data function pointers

There are several CM operations which behave similarly across OMAP2+
SoCs, but which have slight differences in their underlying
implementations.

This patch creates the support code for this function pointer
registration process.  No function pointers are included yet, but a
subsequent patch will create these for the module IDLEST registers.

This patch allows other code to use CM-provided data and operations
without needing to know which SoC is currently in use.  A further
description of the concept is provided in the patch entitled
"ARM: OMAP2+: PRM: prepare for use of prm_ll_data function pointers".
