drivers/video/backlight/lp855x_bl.c: remove unnecessary mutex code

The mutex for accessing lp855x registers is used in case of the user-space
interaction.  When the brightness is changed via sysfs, the mutex is
required.  But the backlight class device already provides it.  Thus, the
lp855x mutex is unnecessary.
