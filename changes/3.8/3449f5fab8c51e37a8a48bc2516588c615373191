ASoC: fsi: add SND_SOC_DAIFMT_INV_xxx support

Current FSI driver is using platform information pointer,
but it is not good design for DT support.
This patch adds SND_SOC_DAIFMT_INV_xxx support,
and it is possible to independent from platform information pointer.

Old type SH_FSI_xxx_INV is still supported,
but it will be removed soon.
