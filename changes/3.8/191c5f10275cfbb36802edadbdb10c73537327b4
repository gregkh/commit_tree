TTY: call tty_port_destroy in the rest of drivers

After commit "TTY: move tty buffers to tty_port", the tty buffers are
not freed in some drivers. This is because tty_port_destructor is not
called whenever a tty_port is freed. This was an assumption I counted
with but was unfortunately untrue. So fix the drivers to fulfil this
assumption.

To be sure, the TTY buffers (and later some stuff) are gone along with
the tty_port, we have to call tty_port_destroy at tear-down places.
This is mostly where the structure containing a tty_port is freed.
This patch does exactly that -- put tty_port_destroy at those places.
