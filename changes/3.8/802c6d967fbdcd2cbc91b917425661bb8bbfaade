rbd: define common queue_con_delay()

This patch defines a single function, queue_con_delay() to call
queue_delayed_work() for a connection.  It basically generalizes
what was previously queue_con() by adding the delay argument.
queue_con() is now a simple helper that passes 0 for its delay.
queue_con_delay() returns 0 if it queued work or an errno if it
did not for some reason.

If con_work() finds the BACKOFF flag set for a connection, it now
calls queue_con_delay() to handle arranging to start again after a
delay.

Note about connection reference counts:  con_work() only ever gets
called as a work item function.  At the time that work is scheduled,
a reference to the connection is acquired, and the corresponding
con_work() call is then responsible for dropping that reference
before it returns.

Previously, the backoff handling inside con_work() silently handed
off its reference to delayed work it scheduled.  Now that
queue_con_delay() is used, a new reference is acquired for the
newly-scheduled work, and the original reference is dropped by the
con->ops->put() call at the end of the function.
