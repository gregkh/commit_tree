tuntap: multiqueue support

This patch converts tun/tap to a multiqueue devices and expose the multiqueue
queues as multiple file descriptors to userspace. Internally, each tun_file were
abstracted as a queue, and an array of pointers to tun_file structurs were
stored in tun_structure device, so multiple tun_files were allowed to be
attached to the device as multiple queues.

When choosing txq, we first try to identify a flow through its rxhash, if it
does not have such one, we could try recorded rxq and then use them to choose
the transmit queue. This policy may be changed in the future.
