powernow-k8: Add a kconfig dependency on acpi-cpufreq

Andreas reports in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51741
that with his Gentoo config, acpi-cpufreq wasn't enabled and
powernow-k8 couldn't handoff properly to acpi-cpufreq leading to
running without P-state support (i.e., cores are constantly in P0).

To alleaviate that, we need to make powernow-k8 depend on acpi-cpufreq
so that acpi-cpufreq is always present.
