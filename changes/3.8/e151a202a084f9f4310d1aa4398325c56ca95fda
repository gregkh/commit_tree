Thermal: Introduce a step_wise thermal governor

This patch adds a simple step_wise governor to the
generic thermal layer. This algorithm throttles the
cooling devices in a linear fashion. If the 'trend'
is heating, it throttles by one step. And if the
thermal trend is cooling it de-throttles by one step.

This actually moves the throttling logic from thermal_sys.c
and puts inside step_wise.c, without any change.
