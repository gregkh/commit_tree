serial: ifx6x60: different SPI word width configure requires different swap process

SPI protocol driver only provide one function (swap_buf()) to swap SPI
data into big endian format, which is only available when SPI
controller's word width is 16 bits. But word width could be configured
as 8/16/32 bits, different word width configure should be mapped to
different swap methods.This patch is to make SPI protocol driver choose
the right swap function corresponding to SPI word width configuration.
