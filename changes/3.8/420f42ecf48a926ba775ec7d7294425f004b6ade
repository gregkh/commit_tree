s390/irq: remove split irq fields from /proc/stat

Now that irq sum accounting for /proc/stat's "intr" line works again we
have the oddity that the sum field (first field) contains only the sum
of the second (external irqs) and third field (I/O interrupts).
The reason for that is that these two fields are already sums of all other
fields. So if we would sum up everything we would count every interrupt
twice.
This is broken since the split interrupt accounting was merged two years
ago: 052ff461c8427629aee887ccc27478fc7373237c "[S390] irq: have detailed
statistics for interrupt types".
To fix this remove the split interrupt fields from /proc/stat's "intr"
line again and only have them in /proc/interrupts.

This restores the old behaviour, seems to be the only sane fix and mimics
a behaviour from other architectures where /proc/interrupts also contains
more than /proc/stat's "intr" line does.
