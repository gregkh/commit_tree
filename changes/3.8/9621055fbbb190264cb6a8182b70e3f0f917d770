ALSA: usb6fire: prevent driver panic state when stopping

The patch below prevents the 6fire usb driver going into panic state
when stopping playing. On some systems the urb in handler
(usb6fire_pcm_in_urb_handler) is being called while urbs are being
killed off, this causes the driver to set panic state and can result in
the kernel warning 'URB %p submitted while active'.
