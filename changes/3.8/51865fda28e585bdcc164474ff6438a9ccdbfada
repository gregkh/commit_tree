ext4: let ext4 maintain extent status tree

This patch lets ext4 maintain extent status tree.

Currently it only tracks delay extent status in extent status tree.  When a
delay allocation is issued, the related delay extent will be inserted into
extent status tree.  When a delay extent is written out or invalidated, it will
be removed from this tree.
