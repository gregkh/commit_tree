nl80211/cfg80211: support VHT channel configuration

Change nl80211 to support specifying a VHT (or HT)
using the control channel frequency (as before) and
new attributes for the channel width and first and
second center frequency. The old channel type is of
course still supported for HT.

Also change the cfg80211 channel definition struct
to support these by adding the relevant fields to
it (and removing the _type field.)

This also adds new helper functions:
 - cfg80211_chandef_create to create a channel def
   struct given the control channel and channel type,
 - cfg80211_chandef_identical to check if two channel
   definitions are identical
 - cfg80211_chandef_compatible to check if the given
   channel definitions are compatible, and return the
   wider of the two

This isn't entirely complete, but that doesn't matter
until we have a driver using it. In particular, it's
missing
 - regulatory checks on the usable bandwidth (if that
   even makes sense)
 - regulatory TX power (database can't deal with it)
 - a proper channel compatibility calculation for the
   new channel types
