cpuidle: fixup device.h header in cpuidle.h

The "struct device" is only used in sysfs.c.

The other .c files including the private header "cpuidle.h"
do not need to pull the entire headers tree from there as they
don't manipulate the "struct device".

This patch fixes this by moving the header inclusion to sysfs.c
and adding a forward declaration for the struct device.
