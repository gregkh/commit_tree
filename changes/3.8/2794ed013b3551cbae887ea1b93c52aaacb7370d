Btrfs: fix permissions of empty files not affected by umask

When a new file is created with btrfs_create(), the inode will initially be
created with permissions 0666 and later on in btrfs_init_acl() it will be
adapted to mask out the umask bits. The problem is that this change won't make
it into the btrfs_inode unless there's another change to the inode (e.g. writing
content changing the size or touching the file changing the mtime.)

This fix adds a call to btrfs_update_inode() to btrfs_create() to make sure that
the change will not get lost if the in-memory inode is flushed before other
changes are made to the file.
