x86-64: Replace left over sti/cli in ia32 audit exit code

For some reason they didn't get replaced so far by their
paravirt equivalents, resulting in code to be run with
interrupts disabled that doesn't expect so (causing, in the
observed case, a BUG_ON() to trigger) when syscall auditing is
enabled.

David (Cc-ed) came up with an identical fix, so likely this can
be taken to count as an ack from him.
