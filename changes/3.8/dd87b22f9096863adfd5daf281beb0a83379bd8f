bfin_mac: offer a PTP Hardware Clock.

The BF518 has a PTP time unit that works in a similar way to other MAC
based clocks, like gianfar, ixp46x, and igb. This patch adds support for
using the blackfin as a PHC. Although the blackfin hardware does offer a
few ancillary features, this patch implements only the basic operations.

Compile tested only.
