drm/i915: Preallocate the drm_mm_node prior to manipulating the GTT drm_mm manager

As we may reap neighbouring objects in order to free up pages for
allocations, we need to be careful not to allocate in the middle of the
drm_mm manager. To accomplish this, we can simply allocate the
drm_mm_node up front and then use the combined search & insert
drm_mm routines, reducing our code footprint in the process.
