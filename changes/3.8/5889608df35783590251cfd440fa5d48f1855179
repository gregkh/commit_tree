xfs: syncd workqueue is no more

With the syncd functions moved to the log and/or removed, the syncd
workqueue is the only remaining bit left. It is used by the log
covering/ail pushing work, as well as by the inode reclaim work.

Given how cheap workqueues are these days, give the log and inode
reclaim work their own work queues and kill the syncd work queue.
