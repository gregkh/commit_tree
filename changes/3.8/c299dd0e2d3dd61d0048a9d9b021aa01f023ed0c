CIFS: Fix write after setting a read lock for read oplock files

If we have a read oplock and set a read lock in it, we can't write to the
locked area - so, filemap_fdatawrite may fail with a no information for a
userspace application even if we request a write to non-locked area. Fix
this by populating the page cache without marking affected pages dirty
after a successful write directly to the server.

Also remove CONFIG_CIFS_SMB2 ifdefs because it's suitable for both CIFS
and SMB2 protocols.
