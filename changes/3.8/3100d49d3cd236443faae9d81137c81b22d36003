sata_promise: fix hardreset lockdep error

sata_promise's pdc_hard_reset_port() needs to serialize because it
flips a port-specific bit in controller register that's shared by
all ports. The code takes the ata host lock for this, but that's
broken because an interrupt may arrive on our irq during the hard
reset sequence, and that too will take the ata host lock. With
lockdep enabled a big nasty warning is seen.

Fixed by adding private state to the ata host structure, containing
a second lock used only for serializing the hard reset sequences.
This eliminated the lockdep warnings both on my test rig and on
the original reporter's machine.
