bdi: add a user-tunable cpu_list for the bdi flusher threads

In realtime environments, it may be desirable to keep the per-bdi
flusher threads from running on certain cpus.  This patch adds a
cpu_list file to /sys/class/bdi/* to enable this.  The default is to tie
the flusher threads to the same numa node as the backing device (though
I could be convinced to make it a mask of all cpus to avoid a change in
behaviour).

Thanks to Jeremy Eder for the original idea.
