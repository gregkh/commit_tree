gpiolib: Refactor gpio_export

The gpio_export function uses nested if statements and the status
variable to handle the failure cases. This makes the function logic
difficult to follow. Refactor the code to abort immediately on failure
using goto. This makes the code slightly longer, but significantly
reduces the nesting and number of split lines and makes the code easier
to read.
