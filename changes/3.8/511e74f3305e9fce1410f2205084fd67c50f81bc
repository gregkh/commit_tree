SERIAL: omap: no need to re-read EFR

There's no need to re-read EFR after we've recently written it; the
register is a configuration register which doesn't change its value
without us writing to it.  The last value which was written to this
register was up->efr.

Removing this re-reading avoids the possibility that we end up with
up->efr having unintended bits set, which should only be temporarily
set when accessing the enhanced features.
