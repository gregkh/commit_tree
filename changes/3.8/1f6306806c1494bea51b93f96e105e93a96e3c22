cifs: deal with id_to_sid embedded sid reply corner case

A SID could potentially be embedded inside of payload.value if there are
no subauthorities, and the arch has 8 byte pointers. Allow for that
possibility there.

While we're at it, rephrase the "embedding" check in terms of
key->payload to allow for the possibility that the union might change
size in the future.
