workqueue: add WARN_ON_ONCE() on CPU number to wq_worker_waking_up()

Recently, workqueue code has gone through some changes and we found
some bugs related to concurrency management operations happening on
the wrong CPU.  When a worker is concurrency managed
(!WORKER_NOT_RUNNIG), it should be bound to its associated cpu and
woken up to that cpu.  Add WARN_ON_ONCE() to verify this.
