memcg: do not check for mm in __mem_cgroup_count_vm_event

The mm given to __mem_cgroup_count_vm_event() cannot be NULL because the
function is either called from the page fault path or vma->vm_mm is used.
So the check can be dropped.

The check was introduced by commit 456f998ec817 ("memcg: add the
pagefault count into memcg stats") because the originally proposed patch
used current->mm for shmem but this has been changed to vma->vm_mm later
on without the check being removed (thanks to Hugh for this
recollection).
