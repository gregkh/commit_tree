HID: usbhid: quirk for Formosa IR receiver

Patch to add the Formosa Industrial Computing, Inc. Infrared Receiver
[IR605A/Q] to hid-ids.h and hid-quirks.c.  This IR receiver causes about a 10
second timeout when the usbhid driver attempts to initialze the device.  Adding
this device to the quirks list with HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS removes the
delay.
