ARM: ux500: CONFIG: Enable GPIO Regulators

It is the intention to convert the MMC voltage changing from
GPIO flipping to using a proper GPIO regulator interface. A
prerequisite of that is to enable the GPIO regulator
functionality. As this affects all ux5x0 based boards we'll
do it here instead of in the Kconfigs.
