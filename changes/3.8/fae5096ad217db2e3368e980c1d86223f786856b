nfsd: assume writeable exportabled filesystems have f_sync

I don't really see how you could claim to support nfsd and not support
fsync somehow.

And in practice a quick look through the exportable filesystems suggests
the only ones without an ->fsync are read-only (efs, isofs, squashfs) or
in-memory (shmem).

Also, performing a write and then returning an error if the sync fails
(as we would do here in the wgather case) seems unhelpful to clients.

Also remove an incorrect comment.
