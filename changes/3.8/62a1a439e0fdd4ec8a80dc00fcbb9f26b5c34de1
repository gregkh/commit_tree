cifs: clean up handling of unc= option

Make sure we free any existing memory allocated for vol->UNC, just in
case someone passes in multiple unc= options.

Get rid of the check for too long a UNC. The check for >300 bytes seems
arbitrary. We later copy this into the tcon->treeName, for instance and
it's a lot shorter than 300 bytes.

Eliminate an extra kmalloc and copy as well. Just set the vol->UNC
directly with the contents of match_strdup.

Establish that the UNC should be stored with '\\' delimiters. Use
convert_delimiter to change it in place in the vol->UNC.

Finally, move the check for a malformed UNC into
cifs_parse_mount_options so we can catch that situation earlier.
