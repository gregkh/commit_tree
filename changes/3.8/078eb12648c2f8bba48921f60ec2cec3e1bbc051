ACPI / PM: Provide device PM functions operating on struct acpi_device

If the caller of acpi_bus_set_power() already has a pointer to the
struct acpi_device object corresponding to the device in question, it
doesn't make sense for it to go through acpi_bus_get_device(), which
may be costly, because it involves acquiring the global ACPI
namespace mutex.

For this reason, export the function operating on struct acpi_device
objects used internally by acpi_bus_set_power(), so that it may be
called instead of acpi_bus_set_power() in the above case, and change
its name to acpi_device_set_power().

Additionally, introduce two inline wrappers for checking ACPI PM
capabilities of devices represented by struct acpi_device objects.
