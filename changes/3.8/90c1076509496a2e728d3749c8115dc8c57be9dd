Staging: rtl8187se: remove check for IW_ENCODE_DISABLED

The original code had a no-op stub where it checked if
IW_ENCODE_DISABLED and did nothing.  Then in a cleanup patch we
accidentally turned the check on.  That was: de171bd6ff "Staging:
rtl8187se: r8180_wx: fixed a lot of checkpatch.pl issues".

The check should just be removed.
