vfs: d_obtain_alias() needs to use "/" as default name.

NFS appears to use d_obtain_alias() to create the root dentry rather than
d_make_root.  This can cause 'prepend_path()' to complain that the root
has a weird name if an NFS filesystem is lazily unmounted.  e.g.  if
"/mnt" is an NFS mount then

 { cd /mnt; umount -l /mnt ; ls -l /proc/self/cwd; }

will cause a WARN message like
   WARNING: at /home/git/linux/fs/dcache.c:2624 prepend_path+0x1d7/0x1e0()
   ...
   Root dentry has weird name <>

to appear in kernel logs.

So change d_obtain_alias() to use "/" rather than "" as the anonymous
name.
