staging: comedi: addi-data: remove attach option to disable dma

This pci driver currently uses the comedi legacy attach mechanism
which allows the user to pass configuration options to the driver
when it is attached to the comedi subsystem. The use of these
configuration options is preventing the conversion of the addi-data
drivers to the comedi auto attach mechanism.

For the addi-data drivers, option[2] is used to enable/disable dma.
The default (0) action is to enable dma is the driver supports it.

Remove this configuration option and just enable dma if it is
supported.
