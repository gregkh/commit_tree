ARM: imx: configs: Enable CONFIG_MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT

Since commit b4c184e5 (edia] media: reorganize the main Kconfig items),
it is necessary to select CONFIG_MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT in order to be able
to use the SoC camera drivers.

Select CONFIG_MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT so that we can use mx2-camera/mx3-camera
by default as previously.
