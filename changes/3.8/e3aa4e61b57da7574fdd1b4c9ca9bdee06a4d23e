xen/acpi: revert pad config check in xen_check_mwait

With Xen acpi pad logic added into kernel, we can now revert xen mwait related
patch df88b2d96e36d9a9e325bfcd12eb45671cbbc937 ("xen/enlighten: Disable
MWAIT_LEAF so that acpi-pad won't be loaded. "). The reason is, when running under
newer Xen platform, Xen pad driver would be early loaded, so native pad driver
would fail to be loaded, and hence no mwait/monitor #UD risk again.

Another point is, only Xen4.2 or later support Xen acpi pad, so we won't expose
mwait cpuid capability when running under older Xen platform.
