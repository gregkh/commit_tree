lguest: fix block request handling in example launcher.

virtio requests are scatter-gather-style descriptors, but no
assumptions should be made about the layout.  lguest was lazy here,
but saved by the fact that the network device hands all requests to
tun (which does it correctly) and console and random devices simply
use readv and writev.

Block devices, however, are broken: we convert to iovecs internally,
just make sure we handle the correctly.
