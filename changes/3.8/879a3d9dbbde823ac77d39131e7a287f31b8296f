cgroup: use cgroup_addrm_files() in cgroup_clear_directory()

cgroup_clear_directory() incorrectly invokes cgroup_rm_file() on each
cftset of the target subsystems, which only removes the first file of
each set.  This leaves dangling files after subsystems are removed
from a cgroup root via remount.

Use cgroup_addrm_files() to remove all files of target subsystems.

tj: Move cgroup_addrm_files() prototype decl upwards next to other
    global declarations.  Commit message updated.
