ARM: OMAP: Fix relative includes for fpga.h

As discussed on linux-arm-kernel, we want to avoid
relative includes for the arch/arm/*omap* code:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg80520.html

Fix includes for fpga.h by making fpga.h local
to mach-omap1. The common code in plat-omap just
needs to know the struct h2p2_dbg_fpga, which can
be local to debug-leds.c.

This also fixes the braindead <../*.h> style includes
that got accidentally added with search and replace
during the cleanup.
