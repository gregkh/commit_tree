ASoC: adsp: Add ADSP base support

Many current Wolfson devices feature DSPs based around an architecture
known as ADSP.  Since there is a lot of commonality in the system
integration of these devices a common library will be used to provide
support for them.

This version provides equivalent support for ADSP1 to that currently
included in the WM2200 driver.
