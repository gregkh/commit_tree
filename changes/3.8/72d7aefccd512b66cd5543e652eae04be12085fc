Btrfs: increase BTRFS_MAX_MIRRORS by one for dev replace

This change of the define is effective in all modes, it
is required and used only in the case when a device replace
procedure is running. The reason is that during an active
device replace procedure, the target device of the copy
operation is a mirror for the filesystem data as well that
can be used to read data in order to repair read errors on
other disks.
