ARM: OMAP3: Correct HWMOD DMTIMER SYSC register declarations

Currently, the OMAP3 HWMOD data defines two TIOCP_CFG register structures
(referred to as the SYSC register in the HWMOD data) where timers 1, 2 and 10
use one of the defintions and the other timers use the other definition. For
OMAP3 devices the structure of the DMTIMER TIOCP_CFG register is the same for
all 12 instances of the DMTIMER. Please note that this is a difference between
OMAP3 and OMAP4 and could be the source of the confusion.

For OMAP3 devices, the DMTIMER TIOCP_CFG register has the fields,
clock-activity, emufree, idlemode, enwakeup, softreset and autoidle for all
12 timers. Therefore, remove one of the SYSC register definitions for the
DMTIMERs and ensure the appropriate register fields are defined for all
DMTIMERs.
