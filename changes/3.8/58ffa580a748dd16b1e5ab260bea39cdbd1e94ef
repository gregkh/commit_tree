drbd: introduce stop-sector to online verify

We now can schedule only a specific range of sectors for online verify,
or interrupt a running verify without interrupting the connection.

Had to bump the protocol version differently, we are now 101.
Added verify_can_do_stop_sector() { protocol >= 97 && protocol != 100; }

Also, the return value convention for worker callbacks has changed,
we returned "true/false" for "keep the connection up" in 8.3,
we return 0 for success and <= for failure in 8.4.
Affected: receive_state()
