i2c: omap: Restore i2c context always

Currently the restore is done based on the flag
OMAP_I2C_FLAG_RESET_REGS_POSTIDLE.

This helps the following
- The driver is always capable of restoring regardless
of the off mode support being there or not.

- While testing omap2430 it is found that in case of certain
error paths (timeout) a reset is done. However the restore
never happens as it is dependent on the POSTIDLE flag.
The other option would be to call a restore in the reset
case. As there are only a few registers to be restored
the penalty in the idle case should not be much.
