spi/pl022: add IDLE state pin management

This commit allow to put pins in IDLE state in
runtime_suspend and in SLEEP state in suspend, corresponding
to defined semantics in <linux/pinctrl/pinctrl-state.h>.

To do this, just add a boolean parameter runtime
to pl022_resume_resources/pl022_suspend_resources which
indicates if it's called from PM_RUNTIME callbacks or not.
