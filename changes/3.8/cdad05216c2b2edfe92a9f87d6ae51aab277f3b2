drm/ttm, drm/vmwgfx: Use RCU locking for object lookups v3

The mostly used lookup+get put+potential_destroy path of TTM objects
is converted to use RCU locks. This will substantially decrease the amount
of locked bus cycles during normal operation.
Since we use kfree_rcu to free the objects, no rcu synchronization is needed
at module unload time.

v2: Don't touch include/linux/kref.h
v3: Adapt to kref_get_unless_zero return value change
