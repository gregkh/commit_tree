staging: comedi: addi_apci_2032: fix digital output 'insn_bits' function

This driver does not follow the comedi API. The digital output 'insn_bits'
function is passed a mask value in data[0] indicating which output bits in
data[1] are changing. The function is then supposed to update the outputs
accordingly and then return the current state of the outputs in data[1].

Currently this driver uses the 'insn_write' function to update either a
single or all the output channels. And it uses the 'insn_bits' function
to read either a single or all the output channel states.

Fix the 'insn_bits' function so it works like the comedi core expects. The
core can then use the function to emulate the 'insn_read' and 'insn_write'
functions for individual channels.
