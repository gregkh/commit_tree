doc: Remove unnecessary declarations from Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c

stime and utime are declared __u64 but are never used.  On a glibc system
this is harmless lint, but on a uClibc system, because of the difference
in they way header files stack, including stdio.h brings in time.h and
this causes a name collision with stime.  Since these are useless anyhow,
we remove them.
