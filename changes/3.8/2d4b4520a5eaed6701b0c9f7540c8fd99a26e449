i2c: omap: adopt pinctrl support

Some GPIO expanders need some early pin control muxing. Due to
legacy boards sometimes the driver uses subsys_initcall instead of
module_init. This patch takes advantage of defer probe feature
and pin control in order to wait until pin control probing before
GPIO driver probing. It has been tested on OMAP5 board with TCA6424
driver.
