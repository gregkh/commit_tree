Input: i8042-io - fix up region handling on MIPS

i8042_platform_init() skips reguest_region() on MIPS, but in
i8042_platform_exit() release_region() is still called. Fix this by
reserving the region also on MIPS.

The patch eliminates the following error message seen on MIPS:

[    2.112000] Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000000000000060-000000000000006f>
