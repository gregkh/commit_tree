xfs: use b_maps[] for discontiguous buffers

Commits starting at 77c1a08 introduced a multiple segment support
to xfs_buf. xfs_trans_buf_item_match() could not find a multi-segment
buffer in the transaction because it was looking at the single segment
block number rather than the multi-segment b_maps[0].bm.bn. This
results on a recursive buffer lock that can never be satisfied.

This patch:
 1) Changed the remaining b_map accesses to be b_maps[0] accesses.
 2) Renames the single segment b_map structure to __b_map to avoid
    future confusion.
