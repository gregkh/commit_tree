arm64: generic timer: use virtual counter instead of physical at EL0

We want to use the virtual counter at EL0, as the physical counter
may not track the current clocksource for guests running under a
hypervisor.

This patch updates the vdso and generic timer driver to use the virtual
counter. The kernel EL2 entry code is also updated to ensure that the
virtual offset is initialised to zero.
