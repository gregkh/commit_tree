staging: omap-thermal: fix context restore function

In the context restore function, if the context is lost or
not is being checked by the contents of the counter register.
But this is logic hold good as long as counter reset value is
zero, if the reset value is non-zero then above logic doesn't
hold good. Hence removed checking of the register value and
restoring the context.
