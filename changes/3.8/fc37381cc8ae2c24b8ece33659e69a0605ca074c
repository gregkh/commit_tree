drm/i915: Increase the response time for slow SDVO devices

Some devices may respond very slowly and only flag that the reply is
pending within the first 15us response window. Be kind to such devices
and wait a further 15ms, before checking for the pending reply. This
moves the existing special case delay of 30ms down from the detection
routine into the common path and pretends to explain it...

v2: Simplify the loop constructs as suggested by Jani Nikula.
