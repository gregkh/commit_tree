iommu/omap: Migrate to hwmod framework

Use hwmod data and device attributes to build and register an
omap device for iommu driver.

 - Update the naming convention in isp module.
 - Remove unneeded check for number of resources, as this is now
   handled by omap_device and prevents driver from loading.
 - Now unused, remove platform device and resource data, handling
   of sysconfig register for softreset purposes, use default
   latency structure.
 - Use hwmod API for reset handling.
