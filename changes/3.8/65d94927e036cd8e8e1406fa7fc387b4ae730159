drbd: Changed some defaults

* Enabled the resync controller, with a fill target of 50Kib. That gives
  reasonable resync speeds without tuning. A much better default than
  the 250KiB/s fixed.

* Enable bitmap compression. It is save to use, and most people have
  more CPU power than network bandwidth.

* ko-count of 7: Abort a connection if the peer fails to process a
  write request within 42 seconds.

* al-extents of 1237: ~5 GiB seems to be a much more sane default
  these days.
