ARM: OMAP: SmartReflex: pass device dependent data via platform data

Remove the device dependent code (ex. cpu_is_xxx()) and settings
from the driver code and instead pass them via the platform
data. This allows a clean separation of the driver code and the platform
code, as required by the move of the platform header files to
include/linux/platform_data.

Note about the smartreflex functional clocks: the smartreflex fclks
are derived from sys_clk and have the same name as the main_clk from
the hwmod entry, in order for the SmartReflex driver to request the
fclk (using clk_get(dev, "fck")).
