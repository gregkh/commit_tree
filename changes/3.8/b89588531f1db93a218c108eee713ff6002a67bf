br2684: don't send frames on not-ready vcc

Avoid submitting packets to a vcc which is being closed. Things go badly
wrong when the ->pop method gets later called after everything's been
torn down.

Use the ATM socket lock for synchronisation with vcc_destroy_socket(),
which clears the ATM_VF_READY bit under the same lock. Otherwise, we
could end up submitting a packet to the device driver even after its
->ops->close method has been called. And it could call the vcc's ->pop
method after the protocol has been shut down. Which leads to a panic.
