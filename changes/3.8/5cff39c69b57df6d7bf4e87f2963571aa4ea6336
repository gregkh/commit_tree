TTY: tty_buffer, cache pointer to tty->buf

During the move of tty buffers from tty_struct to tty_port, we will
need to switch all users of buf to tty->port->buf. There are many
functions where this is accessed directly in their code many times.
Cache the tty->buf pointer in such functions now and change only
single lines in each function in the next patch.

Not that it is convenient for the next patch, but the code is now also
more readable.
