sparc64: Fix get_user_pages_fast() wrt. THP.

Mostly mirrors the s390 logic, as unlike x86 we don't need the
SetPageReferenced() bits.

On sparc64 we also lack a user/privileged bit in the huge PMDs.

In order to make this work for THP and non-THP builds, some header
file adjustments were necessary.  Namely, provide the PMD_HUGE_* bit
defines and the pmd_large() inline unconditionally rather than
protected by TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE.
