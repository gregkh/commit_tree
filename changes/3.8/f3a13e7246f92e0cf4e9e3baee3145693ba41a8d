ARM: OMAP2/3: Define HWMOD software reset status for DMTIMERs

For OMAP2/3 devices, the HWMOD data does not define a software reset status
field for the DMTIMERs. Therefore, when HWMOD performs a soft-reset of the
DMTIMER we don't check and wait for the reset to complete. For OMAP2/3 devices,
the software reset status for a DMTIMER can be read from bit 0 of the DMTIMER
TISTAT register (referred to as the SYSS register in HWMOD). Add the
appropriate HWMOD definitions so that HWMOD will check the software reset
status when performing a software reset of the DMTIMER.
