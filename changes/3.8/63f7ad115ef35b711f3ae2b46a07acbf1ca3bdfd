serial: sh-sci: mask SCTFDR/RFDR according to fifosize

Current mask 0xff to SCTFDR/RFDR damages SCIFB, because the
registers on SCIFB have 9-bit data (0 to 256).

This patch changes the mask according to port->fifosize.
Though I'm not sure if the mask is really needed (I don't know if
there are variants which have non-zero upper bits), it is safer.
