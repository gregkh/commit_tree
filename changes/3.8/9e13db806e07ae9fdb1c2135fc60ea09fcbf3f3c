ALSA: ice1712: Fix build errors

Fix build errors by using correct kconfig symbol name:

sound/pci/ice1712/psc724.c:417:5: error: 'struct snd_ice1712' has no member named 'pm_resume'
sound/pci/ice1712/psc724.c:418:5: error: 'struct snd_ice1712' has no member named 'pm_suspend_enabled'

[Fixed another #ifdef CONFIG_PM in the same file, too, by tiwai]
