cgroup: fix lockdep warning for event_control

The cgroup_event_wake() function is called with the wait queue head
locked and it takes cgrp->event_list_lock. However, in cgroup_rmdir()
remove_wait_queue() was being called after taking
cgrp->event_list_lock.  Correct the lock ordering by using a temporary
list to obtain the event list to remove from the wait queue.
