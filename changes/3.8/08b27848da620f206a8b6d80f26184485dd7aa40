ASoC: pcm: allow backend hardware to be freed in pause state

When front-end PCM session is in paused state, back-end
PCM session will be put in paused state as well if given
front-end PCM session is the only client of given back-end.
Then, application closes front-end PCM session, DPCM
framework will not allow back-end enters HW_FREE state
so back-end will never get shutdown completely.
