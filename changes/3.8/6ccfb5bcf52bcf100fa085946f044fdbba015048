slab: annotate on-slab caches nodelist locks

We currently provide lockdep annotation for kmalloc caches, and also
caches that have SLAB_DEBUG_OBJECTS enabled.  The reason for this is that
we can quite frequently nest in the l3->list_lock lock, which is not
something trivial to avoid.

My proposal with this patch, is to extend this to caches whose slab
management object lives within the slab as well ("on_slab").  The need for
this arose in the context of testing kmemcg-slab patches.  With such
patchset, we can have per-memcg kmalloc caches.  So the same path that led
to nesting between kmalloc caches will could then lead to in-memcg
nesting.  Because they are not annotated, lockdep will trigger.
