Bluetooth: Handle physical link completion

Several different actions may be taken when an AMP physical link
becomes available.  A channel being created on an AMP controller must
continue the connection process.  A channel being moved needs to
either send a move request or a move response.  A failed physical link
will revert to using a BR/EDR controller if possible.
