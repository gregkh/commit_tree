GFS2: Add test for resource group congestion status

This patch uses information gathered by the recent glock statistics
patch in order to derrive a boolean verdict on the congestion
status of a resource group. This is then used when making decisions
on which resource group to choose during block allocation.

The aim is to avoid resource groups which are heavily contended
by other nodes, while still ensuring locality of access wherever
possible.

Once a reservation has been made in a particular resource group
we continue to use that resource group until a new reservation is
required. This should help to ensure that we do not change resource
groups too often.
