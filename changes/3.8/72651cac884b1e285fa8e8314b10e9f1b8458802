fs: Fix imbalance in freeze protection in mark_files_ro()

File descriptors (even those for writing) do not hold freeze protection.
Thus mark_files_ro() must call __mnt_drop_write() to only drop protection
against remount read-only. Calling mnt_drop_write_file() as we do now
results in:

[ BUG: bad unlock balance detected! ]
3.7.0-rc6-00028-g88e75b6 #101 Not tainted
-------------------------------------
kworker/1:2/79 is trying to release lock (sb_writers) at:
[<ffffffff811b33b4>] mnt_drop_write+0x24/0x30
but there are no more locks to release!
