Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _FLASH2X_READWRITE and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _FLASH2X_READWRITE,
and changes the name of the struct to
bcm_flash2x_readwrite. In addition, any calls to
typedefs FLASH2X_READWRITE, or *PFLASH2X_READWRITE
are changed to call the struct directly.
