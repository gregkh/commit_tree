MAINTAINERS: add an explicit entry for saa7134

While this file was always maintained, there was no explicit entry
for it.

There aren't many things happening at saa7134 side for a long time:
Driver works, and it is stable. When new patches are submitted,
they're new boards addition for hardware I don't have.

So, add a new entry with status equal to Odd fixes to better
reflect it.
