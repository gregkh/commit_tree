Btrfs: optionally avoid reads from device replace source drive

It is desirable to be able to configure the device replace
procedure to avoid reading the source drive (the one to be
copied) whenever possible. This is useful when the number of
read errors on this disk is high, because it would delay the
copy procedure alot. Therefore there is an option to avoid
reading from the source disk unless the repair procedure
really needs to access it. The regular read req asks for
mapping the block with mirror_num == 0, in this case the
source disk is avoided whenever possible. The repair code
selects the mirror_num explicitly (mirror_num != 0), this
case is not changed by this commit.
