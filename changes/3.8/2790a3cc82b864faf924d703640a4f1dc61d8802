Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _S_MIBS_DROPPED_APP_CNTRL_MESSAGES and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for
_S_MIBS_DROPPED_APP_CNTRL_MESSAGES, and
changes the name of the struct to
bcm_mibs_dropped_cntrl_msg.
In addition, any calls to typedef
S_MIBS_DROPPED_APP_CNTRL_MESSAGES
are changed to call the struct directly.
