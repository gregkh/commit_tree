mtd: nandsim: Introduce debugfs infrastructure

It's more user friendly to report debug information and statistics
through debugfs, than to use printing facilites.

This patch introduces a very minimal debugfs infrastructure
and moves eraseblock wear report to an entry located at:

/sys/kernel/debug/nandsim/wear_report

This means we can remove rptwear option and just let
the user get the wear report when we needs to.
