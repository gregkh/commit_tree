fs/exec.c: work around icc miscompilation

The tricky problem is this check:

	if (i++ >= max)

icc (mis)optimizes this check as:

	if (++i > max)

The check now becomes a no-op since max is MAX_ARG_STRINGS (0x7FFFFFFF).

This is "allowed" by the C standard, assuming i++ never overflows,
because signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.  This
optimization effectively reverts the previous commit 362e6663ef23
("exec.c, compat.c: fix count(), compat_count() bounds checking") that
tries to fix the check.

This patch simply moves ++ after the check.
