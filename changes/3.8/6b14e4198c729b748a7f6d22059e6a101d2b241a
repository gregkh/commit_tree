arch/tile: eliminate pt_regs trampolines for syscalls

Using the new current_pt_regs() model, we can remove some trampolines
from assembly code and call directly to the C syscall implementations.
rt_sigreturn() and clone() still need some assembly wrapping, but no
longer are passed a pt_regs pointer.  sigaltstack() and the
tilepro-specific cmpxchg_badaddr() syscalls are now just straight C.
