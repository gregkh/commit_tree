brcmfmac: use struct brcmf_if parameter in firmware event callbacks

Firmware events are passed to wl_cfg80211 module associated with
the primary net device. With virtual interface support events can
be received for different interfaces, ie. struct brcmf_if instances.
Pass it in the event to determine appropriate net device associated
with the event.
