ARM: OMAP: Fix relative includes for debug-devices.h

As discussed on linux-arm-kernel, we want to avoid
relative includes for the arch/arm/*omap* shared code:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg80520.html

Let's add plat/debug-devices.h for debug_card_init()
to fix the relative includes.

Note that drivers must not use this header as it will
break build for omap2+ CONFIG_MULTIPLATFORM builds.
