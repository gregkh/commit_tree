KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix updates of vcpu->cpu

This removes the powerpc "generic" updates of vcpu->cpu in load and
put, and moves them to the various backends.

The reason is that "HV" KVM does its own sauce with that field
and the generic updates might corrupt it. The field contains the
CPU# of the -first- HW CPU of the core always for all the VCPU
threads of a core (the one that's online from a host Linux
perspective).

However, the preempt notifiers are going to be called on the
threads VCPUs when they are running (due to them sleeping on our
private waitqueue) causing unload to be called, potentially
clobbering the value.
