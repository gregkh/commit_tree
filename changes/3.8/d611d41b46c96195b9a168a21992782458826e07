mtd: diskonchip: use inline functions for DocRead/DocWrite

The diskonchip drivers traditionally use home-grown macros for
doing MMIO accesses, which cause a lot of warnings, at least
on ARM machines:

drivers/mtd/devices/doc2000.c: In function 'doc_write':
drivers/mtd/devices/doc2000.c:854:5: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value]
drivers/mtd/devices/doc2000.c: In function 'doc_erase':
drivers/mtd/devices/doc2000.c:1123:5: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value
drivers/mtd/nand/diskonchip.c: In function 'doc2000_read_byte':
drivers/mtd/nand/diskonchip.c:318:3: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value]

A nicer solution is to use the architecture-defined I/O accessors.
Here, we use the __raw_readl/__raw_writel style, instead of the
proper readl/writel ones, in order to preserve the odd semantics
of the existing macros that have their own barrier implementation
and no byte swap. It would be nice to fix this properly and use
the correct accessors as well as make the word size independent
from the architecture, but I guess the hardware is obsolete
enough that we should better not mess the driver an more than
necessary.
