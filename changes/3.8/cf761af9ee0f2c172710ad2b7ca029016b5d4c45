ACPI: Provide generic functions for matching ACPI device nodes

Introduce function acpi_match_device() allowing callers to match
struct device objects with populated acpi_handle fields against
arrays of ACPI device IDs.  Also introduce function
acpi_driver_match_device() using acpi_match_device() internally and
allowing callers to match a struct device object against an array of
ACPI device IDs provided by a device driver.

Additionally, introduce macro ACPI_PTR() that may be used by device
drivers to escape pointers to data structures whose definitions
depend on CONFIG_ACPI.
