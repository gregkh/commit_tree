xfs: xfs_syncd_stop must die

xfs_syncd_start and xfs_syncd_stop tie a bunch of unrelated
functionailty together that actually have different start and stop
requirements. Kill these functions and open code the start/stop
methods for each of the background functions.

Subsequent patches will move the start/stop functions around to the
correct places to avoid races and shutdown issues.
