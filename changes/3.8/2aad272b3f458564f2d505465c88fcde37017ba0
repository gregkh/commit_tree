ALSA: usb-audio: correct M-Audio C400 clock source quirk

Taking another look at the C400 descriptors, I see now that there is
a clock selector (0x80) for this device.
Right now, the clock source points to the internal clock (0x81), which
is also valid. When the external clock source (0x82) is selected in the
mixer, and the rates mismatch (if it's free-running it is fixed to
48KHz), xruns will occur.

Set the clock ID to the clock selector unit (0x81), which then
allows the validation code to function correctly.
