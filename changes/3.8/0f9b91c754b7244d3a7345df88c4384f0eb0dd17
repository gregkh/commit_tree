drm/i915: flush system agent TLBs on SNB

This allows us to map the PTEs WC. I've not done thorough testing or
performance measurements with this patch, but it should be decent.

This is based on a patch from Jesse with the original commit message
> I've only lightly tested this so far, but the corruption seems to be
> gone if I write the GFX_FLSH_CNTL reg after binding an object.  This

It has been updated for the new AGP-less code by me, and included with
it is feedback from the original patch.

v2: Updated to reflect paranoia on pte updates/register posting reads.
