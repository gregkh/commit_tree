HID: sensors: autodetect USB HID sensor hubs

It should not be necessary to add IDs for HID sensor hubs to lists in
hid-core.c and hid-sensor-hub.c. So instead of a whitelist, autodetect such USB
HID sensor hubs, based on a collection of type physical inside a useage page of
type sensor. If some sensor hubs stil must be usable as raw devices, a
blacklist might be created.
