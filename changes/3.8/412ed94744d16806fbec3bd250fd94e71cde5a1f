ip_gre: make ipgre_tunnel_xmit() not parse network header as IP unconditionally

ipgre_tunnel_xmit() parses network header as IP unconditionally.
But transmitting packets are not always IP packet. For example such packet
can be sent by packet socket with sockaddr_ll.sll_protocol set.
So make the function check if skb->protocol is IP.
