ACPI / PM: Fix device PM kernedoc comments and #ifdefs

The kerneldoc comments for acpi_pm_device_sleep_state(),
acpi_pm_device_run_wake(), and acpi_pm_device_sleep_wake() are
outdated or otherwise inaccurate and/or don't follow the common
kerneldoc patterns, so fix them.

Additionally, notice that acpi_pm_device_run_wake() should be under
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME rather than under CONFIG_PM_SLEEP, so fix that too.
