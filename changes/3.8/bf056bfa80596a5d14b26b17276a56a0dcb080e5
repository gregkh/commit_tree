proc: Fix the namespace inode permission checks.

Change the proc namespace files into symlinks so that
we won't cache the dentries for the namespace files
which can bypass the ptrace_may_access checks.

To support the symlinks create an additional namespace
inode with it's own set of operations distinct from the
proc pid inode and dentry methods as those no longer
make sense.
