drbd: protect all idr accesses that might sleep with drbd_cfg_rwsem

With this commit the locking for all accesses to IDRs is complete:

 * Non sleeping read accesses are protected by RCU
 * sleeping read accesses are protocted by a read lock on drbd_cfg_rwsem
 * accesses that add anything are protected by a write lock
 * accesses that remove an object are protoected by a write lock
   and a call to synchronize_rcu() after it is removed from the IDR
   and before the object is actually free()ed.
