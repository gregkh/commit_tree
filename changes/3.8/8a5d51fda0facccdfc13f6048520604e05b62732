ARM: tegra: remove <mach/dma.h>

Remove includes of <mach/dma.h> from sound/soc; nothing from it is used.

Remove include of <mach/dma.h> from mach-tegra/apbio.c; since the DMA
transfers made by this file don't need flow-control with any peripheral,
there's no need to set any slave ID.

Once those changes are made, there are no remaining users of <mach/dma.h>
so remove it. Drivers should get this information from device tree. This
removal is necessary for single zImage.
