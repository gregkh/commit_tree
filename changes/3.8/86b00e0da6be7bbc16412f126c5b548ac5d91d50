rbd: get parent spec for version 2 images

Add support for getting the the information identifying the parent
image for rbd images that have them.  The child image holds a
reference to its parent image specification structure.  Create a new
entry "parent" in /sys/bus/rbd/image/N/ to report the identifying
information for the parent image, if any.
