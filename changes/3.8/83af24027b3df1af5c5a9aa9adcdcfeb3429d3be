pwm: Device tree support for PWM polarity

Add support for encoding PWM properties in bit encoded form with
of_pwm_xlate_with_flags() function support. Platforms require platform
specific PWM properties has to populate in 3rd cell of the pwm-specifier
and PWM driver should also set .of_xlate support with this function.
Currently PWM property polarity encoded in bit position 0 of the third
cell in pwm-specifier.
