ext4: let add_dir_entry handle inline data properly

This patch let add_dir_entry handle the inline data case. So the
dir is initialized as inline dir first and then we can try to add
some files to it, when the inline space can't hold all the entries,
a dir block will be created and the dir entry will be moved to it.

Also for an inlined dir, "." and ".." are removed and we only use
4 bytes to store the parent inode number. These 2 entries will be
added when we convert an inline dir to a block-based one.

[ Folded in patch from Dan Carpenter to remove an unused variable. ]
