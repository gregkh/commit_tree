Input: bu21013_ts - request regulator that actually exists

Currently the BU21013 Touch Screen driver requests a regulator by the
name of 'V-TOUCH', which doesn't exist anywhere in the kernel. The
correct name, as referenced in platform regulator code is 'avdd'. Here,
when we request a regulator, we use the correct name instead.
