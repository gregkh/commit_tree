ptrace: introduce PTRACE_O_EXITKILL

Ptrace jailers want to be sure that the tracee can never escape
from the control. However if the tracer dies unexpectedly the
tracee continues to run in potentially unsafe mode.

Add the new ptrace option PTRACE_O_EXITKILL. If the tracer exits
it sends SIGKILL to every tracee which has this bit set.

Note that the new option is not equal to the last-option << 1.  Because
currently all options have an event, and the new one starts the eventless
group.  It uses the random 20 bit, so we have the room for 12 more events,
but we can also add the new eventless options below this one.
