vhost_net: handle polling errors when setting backend

Currently, the polling errors were ignored, which can lead following issues:

- vhost remove itself unconditionally from waitqueue when stopping the poll,
  this may crash the kernel since the previous attempt of starting may fail to
  add itself to the waitqueue
- userspace may think the backend were successfully set even when the polling
  failed.

Solve this by:

- check poll->wqh before trying to remove from waitqueue
- report polling errors in vhost_poll_start(), tx_poll_start(), the return value
  will be checked and returned when userspace want to set the backend

After this fix, there still could be a polling failure after backend is set, it
will addressed by the next patch.
