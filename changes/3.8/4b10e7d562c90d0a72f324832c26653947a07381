mm: mempolicy: Implement change_prot_numa() in terms of change_protection()

This patch converts change_prot_numa() to use change_protection(). As
pte_numa and friends check the PTE bits directly it is necessary for
change_protection() to use pmd_mknuma(). Hence the required
modifications to change_protection() are a little clumsy but the
end result is that most of the numa page table helpers are just one or
two instructions.
