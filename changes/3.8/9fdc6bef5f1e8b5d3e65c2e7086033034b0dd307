tuntap: dont use a private kmem_cache

Commit 96442e42429 (tuntap: choose the txq based on rxq)
added a per tun_struct kmem_cache.

As soon as several tun_struct are used, we get an error
because two caches cannot have same name.

Use the default kmalloc()/kfree_rcu(), as it reduce code
size and doesn't have performance impact here.
