cuse: use mutex as registration lock instead of spinlocks

We need to check for name-collisions during cuse-device registration. To
avoid race-conditions, this needs to be protected during the whole device
registration. Therefore, replace the spinlocks by mutexes first so we can
safely extend the locked regions to include more expensive or sleeping
code paths.
