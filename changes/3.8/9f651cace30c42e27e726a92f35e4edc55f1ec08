net: cdc_mbim: Device Service Stream support

MBIM devices can support up to 256 generic streams called
Device Service Streams (DSS). The MBIM spec says

   The format of the Device Service Stream payload depends
   on the device service (as identified by the corresponding
   UUID) that is used when opening the data stream.

Example use cases are serial AT command interfaces and NMEA
data streams. We cannot make any assumptions about these
device services.

Adding support for Device Service Stream by extending
the MBIM session to VLAN mapping scheme, allocating
VLAN IDs 256 to 511 for DSS, using the DSS SessionID
as the lower 8bit of the VLAN ID.

Using a netdev for DSS keeps the device framing intact and
allows userspace to do whatever it want with the streams.
For example, exporting an AT command interface using DSS
session #0 to a PTY for use with a terminal application like
minicom:

  vconfig add wwan0 256
  ip link set dev wwan0 up
  ip link set dev wwan0.256 up
  socat INTERFACE:wwan0.256,type=2 PTY:,echo=0,link=/tmp/modem

Device configuration must be done using MBIM control commands
over the /dev/cdc-wdmx device. The userspace management
application should coordinate host VLAN configuration and the
device MBIM configuration using the device capabilities to
find out if it needs to set up PTY mappings etc.
