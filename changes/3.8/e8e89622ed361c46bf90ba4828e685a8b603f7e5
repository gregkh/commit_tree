drm/ttm: fix fence locking in ttm_buffer_object_transfer

Noticed while reviewing the fence locking in the radeon pageflip
handler.

v2: Instead of grabbing the bdev->fence_lock in object_transfer just
move the single callsite of that function a few lines, so that it is
protected by the fence_lock. Suggested by Jerome Glisse.

v3: Fix typo in commit message.
