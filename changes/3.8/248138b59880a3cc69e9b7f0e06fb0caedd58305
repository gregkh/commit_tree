drm/i915: fix hsw_fdi_link_train "retry" code

We were previously doing exactly what the "mode set sequence for CRT"
document mandates, but whenever we failed to train the link in the
first tentative, all the other subsequent retries always failed. In
one of my monitors that has 47 modes, I was usually getting around 3
failures when running "testdisplay -a".

After this patch, even if we fail in the first tentative, we can
succeed in the next ones. So now when running "testdisplay -a" I see
around 3 times the message "FDI link training done on step 1" and no
failures.

Notice that now the "retry" code looks a lot like the DP retry code.
