ARM: OMAP1: DMA: Moving OMAP1 DMA channel definitions to mach-omap1

Some of the omap1 dma channel definitions are used by some drivers.
For moving omap1 dma channel definitions to mach-omap1/, the used
ones should be defined locally to driver. Driver can eliminate it
by using DT, platform data, or IORESOURCE_DMA.
And moving OMAP1 DMA channel definitions to mach-omap1
