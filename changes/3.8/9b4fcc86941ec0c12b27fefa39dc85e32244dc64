ARM: OMAP4: Add function table for non-M4X dplls

Currently all OMAP4 non-core DPLLs use the same function table for
configuring DPLLs. For these DPLLs, the function
omap4_dpll_regm4xen_recalc() is used to recalculate the DPLL rate and
the function omap4_dpll_regm4xen_round_rate() is used to calculate the
closest rate to that requested. However, these omap4_dpll_regm4xen_xxx()
functions are only applicable to the ABE DPLL and not the other non-core
DPLLs. Therefore, add a new function table for non-core DPLLs that do
not include the 4X-multiplier (M4X).

Please note that using these omap4_dpll_regm4x_xxx() function works for
the non-M4X DPLLs today because we only check to see if the 4X
multiplier is enabled when calculating the rate. However, it is planned
that the dpll functions will be enhanced to enable the 4X multiplier as
necessary (in order to achieve the requested rate) and so calling these
functions for non-M4X dplls will no longer work.
