ARM: OMAP4: VC: setup I2C parameters based on board data

VC code now provides a table of pre-calculated I2C setup parameters,
which will be used based on the capacitance value calculated for the I2C
trace on the PCB. A default trace length of 6.3cm is used unless board
defines its own value during init. The parameters set will be the I2C
internal pull setup and the I2C timing parameters for high speed use
mode. Full speed mode is not supported as of now.
