ARM: sunxi: Change device tree naming scheme for sunxi

There is several different SoCs sharing the sun5i codename: A10s, A12
and A13. Since there is enough differences to not consider those the
same SoCs, change a bit the naming scheme to reflect this.

Moreover, some boards like the olinuxino come in A10s and A13 variants,
which also share the same SoC codename.

So change the naming scheme to reflect both the codename and the market
name of the SoCs used in the dtsi and in the board files
