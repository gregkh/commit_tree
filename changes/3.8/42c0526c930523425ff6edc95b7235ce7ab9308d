drm/i915: Extract PCU communication

There is a special mechanism for communicating with the PCU already
being used for the ring frequency stuff. As we'll be needing this for
other commands, extract it now to make future code less error prone and
the current code more reusable.

I'm not entirely sure if this code matches 1:1 with the previous code
behaviorally. Functionally however, it should be the same.
