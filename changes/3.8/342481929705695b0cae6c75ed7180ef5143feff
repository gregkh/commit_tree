staging: comedi: addi-data: remove 'allocated' from the private data

This variable is only used as a flag to indicate that the pci device
has been enabled. Use the comedi_device 'iobase' variable to indicate
this instead. This is how it's normally handled in the comedi pci
drivers.

Make the call to comedi_pci_disabled() in i_ADDI_Detach() common
and move it to the end of the function. Both the if and else case
require it.
