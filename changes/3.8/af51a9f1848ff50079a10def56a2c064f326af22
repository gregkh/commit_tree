swiotlb: Do not export swiotlb_bounce since there are no external consumers

Currently swiotlb is the only consumer for swiotlb_bounce.  Since that is the
case it doesn't make much sense to be exporting it so make it a static
function only.

In addition we can save a few more lines of code by making it so that it
accepts the DMA address as a physical address instead of a virtual one.  This
is the last piece in essentially pushing all of the DMA address values to use
physical addresses in swiotlb.

In order to clarify things since we now have 2 physical addresses in use
inside of swiotlb_bounce I am renaming phys to orig_addr, and dma_addr to
tlb_addr.  This way is should be clear that orig_addr is contained within
io_orig_addr and tlb_addr is an address within the io_tlb_addr buffer.
