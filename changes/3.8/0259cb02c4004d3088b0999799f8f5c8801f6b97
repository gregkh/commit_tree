autofs4 - use simple_empty() for empty directory check

For direct (and offset) mounts, if an automounted mount is manually
umounted the trigger mount dentry can appear non-empty causing it to
not trigger mounts. This can also happen if there is a file handle
leak in a user space automounting application.

This happens because, when a ioctl control file handle is opened
on the mount, a cursor dentry is created which causes list_empty()
to see the dentry as non-empty. Since there is a case where listing
the directory of these dentrys is needed, the use of dcache_dir_*()
functions for .open() and .release() is needed.

Consequently simple_empty() must be used instead of list_empty()
when checking for an empty directory.
