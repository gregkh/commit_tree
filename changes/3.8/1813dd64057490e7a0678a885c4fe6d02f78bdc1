xfs: convert buffer verifiers to an ops structure.

To separate the verifiers from iodone functions and associate read
and write verifiers at the same time, introduce a buffer verifier
operations structure to the xfs_buf.

This avoids the need for assigning the write verifier, clearing the
iodone function and re-running ioend processing in the read
verifier, and gets rid of the nasty "b_pre_io" name for the write
verifier function pointer. If we ever need to, it will also be
easier to add further content specific callbacks to a buffer with an
ops structure in place.

We also avoid needing to export verifier functions, instead we
can simply export the ops structures for those that are needed
outside the function they are defined in.

This patch also fixes a directory block readahead verifier issue
it exposed.

This patch also adds ops callbacks to the inode/alloc btree blocks
initialised by growfs. These will need more work before they will
work with CRCs.
