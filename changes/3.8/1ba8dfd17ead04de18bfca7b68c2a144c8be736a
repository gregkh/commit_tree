checkpatch: warn about using CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL

This config item has not carried much meaning for a while now and is
almost always enabled by default.  As agreed during the Linux kernel
summit, it is being removed.  This will discourage future addition of
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL while it is being phased out.
