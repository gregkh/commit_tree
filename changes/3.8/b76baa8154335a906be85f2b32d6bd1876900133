usb: refine phy notify operation during connection and disconnection

At commit 925aa46ba963a4da6d8ee6ab1d04a02ffa8db62b, Richard Zhao
<richard.zhao@freescale.com> adds the phy notification callback
when port change occurs. In fact, this phy notification should
be added according to below rules:

1. Only set HW_USBPHY_CTRL.ENHOSTDISCONDETECT
during high speed host mode.
2. Do not set HW_USBPHY_CTRL.ENHOSTDISCONDETECT
during the reset and speed negotiation period.
3. Do not set HW_USBPHY_CTRL.ENHOSTDISCONDETECT
during host suspend/resume sequence.

Please refer: i.mx23RM(page: 413) for below rules.
http://www.freescale.com/files/dsp/doc/ref_manual/IMX23RM.pdf

Freescale i.MX SoC, i.mx23, i.mx28 and i.mx6(i.mx6SL does not
need to follow the 3rd rule) need to follow above rules.

Current code set connect notification (HW_USBPHY_CTRL.ENHOSTDISCONDETECT)
at hub_port_connect_change, it conflicts with above the 2th rule.

The correct notification setting method should be:
1. Set connect notify after the second bus reset.
2. Set disconnect notify after disconnection.
