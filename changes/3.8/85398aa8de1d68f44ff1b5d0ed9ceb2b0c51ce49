ipc: simplify free_copy() call

Passing and checking of msgflg to free_copy() is redundant.  This patch
sets copy to NULL on declaration instead and checks for non-NULL in
free_copy().

Note: in case of copy allocation failure, error is returned immediately.
So no need to check for IS_ERR() in free_copy().
