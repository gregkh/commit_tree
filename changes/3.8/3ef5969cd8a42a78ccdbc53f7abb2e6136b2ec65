Btrfs: merge inode_list in __merge_refs

When __merge_refs merges two refs, it is also needed to merge the
inode_list of both refs. Otherwise we have missed backrefs and memory
leaks. This happens for example if two inodes share an extent and
both lie in the same leaf and thus also have the same parent.
