efi: Handle deletions and size changes in efivarfs_write_file

A write to an efivarfs file will not always result in a variable of
'count' size after the EFI SetVariable() call. We may have appended to
the existing data (ie, with the EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE attribute), or
even have deleted the variable (with an authenticated variable update,
with a zero datasize).

This change re-reads the updated variable from firmware, to check for
size changes and deletions. In the latter case, we need to drop the
dentry.
