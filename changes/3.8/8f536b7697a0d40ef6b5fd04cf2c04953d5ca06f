KVM: VMX: provide the vmclear function and a bitmap to support VMCLEAR in kdump

The vmclear function will be assigned to the callback function pointer
when loading kvm-intel module. And the bitmap indicates whether we
should do VMCLEAR operation in kdump. The bits in the bitmap are
set/unset according to different conditions.
