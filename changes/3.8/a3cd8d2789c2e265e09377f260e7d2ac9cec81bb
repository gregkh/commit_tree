ACPI / EC: Don't count a SCI interrupt as a false one

Currently when advance_transaction() is called in EC interrupt handler,
if there is nothing driver can do with the interrupt, it will be taken
as a false one.

But this is not always true, as there may be a SCI EC interrupt fired
during normal read/write operation, which should not be counted as a
false one. This patch fixes the problem.
