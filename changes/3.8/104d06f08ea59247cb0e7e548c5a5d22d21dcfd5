fsnotify: take groups mark_lock before mark lock

Race-free addition and removal of a mark to a groups mark list would be easier
if we could lock the mark list of group before we lock the specific mark.
This patch changes the order used to add/remove marks to/from mark lists from

1. mark->lock
2. group->mark_lock
3. inode->i_lock

to

1. group->mark_lock
2. mark->lock
3. inode->i_lock
