drbd: better separate WRITE and READ code paths in drbd_make_request

cherry-picked and adapted from drbd 9 devel branch

READs will be interesting to at most one connection,
WRITEs should be interesting for all established connections.

Introduce some helper functions to hopefully make this easier to follow.
