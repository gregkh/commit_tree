f2fs: fix the debugfs entry creation path

As the "status" debugfs entry will be maintained for entire F2FS filesystem
irrespective of the number of partitions.
So, we can move the initialization to the init part of the f2fs and destroy will
be done from exit part. After making changes, for individual partition mount -
entry creation code will not be executed.
