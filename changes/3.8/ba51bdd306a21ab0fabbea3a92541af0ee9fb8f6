gpio: samsung: Skip registration if pinctrl driver is present on EXYNOS4X12

This patch modifies the Samsung GPIO driver to check for pinctrl driver
presence earlier and use generic matching instead of a single compatible
value.

This allows us to fix warning about unrecognized SoC in case of
EXYNOS4X12, which is not supported by this driver.
