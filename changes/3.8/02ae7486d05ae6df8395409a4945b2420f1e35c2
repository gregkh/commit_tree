cgroup: fix harmless bugs in cgroup_load_subsys() fail path and cgroup_unload_subsys()

* If idr init fails, cgroup_load_subsys() cleared dummytop->subsys[]
  before calilng ->destroy() making CSS inaccessible to the callback,
  and didn't unlink ss->sibling.  As no modular controller uses
  ->use_id, this doesn't cause any actual problems.

* cgroup_unload_subsys() was forgetting to free idr, call
  ->pre_destroy() and clear ->active.  As there currently is no
  modular controller which uses ->use_id, ->pre_destroy() or ->active,
  this doesn't cause any actual problems.
