net: create generic bridge ops

The PF_BRIDGE:RTM_{GET|SET}LINK nlmsg family and type are
currently embedded in the ./net/bridge module. This prohibits
them from being used by other bridging devices. One example
of this being hardware that has embedded bridging components.

In order to use these nlmsg types more generically this patch
adds two net_device_ops hooks. One to set link bridge attributes
and another to dump the current bride attributes.
