ACPI / x86: Add quirk for "CheckPoint P-20-00" to not use bridge _CRS_ info

This is to fix a regression https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47981

The CheckPoint P-20-00 works ok before new machines (2008 and later) are
forced to use the bridge _CRS info by default in 2.6.34. Add this quirk
to restore its old way of working: not using bridge _CRS info.
