net: usbnet: prevent buggy devices from killing us

A device sending 0 length frames as fast as it can has been
observed killing the host system due to the resulting memory
pressure.

Temporarily disable RX skb allocation and URB submission when
the current error ratio is high, preventing us from trying to
allocate an infinite number of skbs.  Reenable as soon as we
are finished processing the done queue, allowing the device
to continue working after short error bursts.
