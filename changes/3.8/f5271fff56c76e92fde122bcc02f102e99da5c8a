netfilter: ip6t_NPT: Fix adjustment calculation

Cast __wsum from/to __sum16 is wrong.  Instead, apply appropriate
conversion function: csum_unfold() or csum_fold().

[ The original patch has been modified to undo the final ~ that
  csum_fold returns. We only need to fold the 32-bit word that
  results from the checksum calculation into a 16-bit to ensure
  that the original subnet is restored appropriately. Spotted by
  Ulrich Weber. ]
