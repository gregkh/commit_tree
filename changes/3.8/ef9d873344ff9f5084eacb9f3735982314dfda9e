xfs: byte range granularity for XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE

XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE simply does not work properly for non page cache
aligned ranges. Neither test 242 or 290 exercise this correctly, so
the behaviour is completely busted even though the tests pass.

Fix it to support full byte range granularity as was originally
intended for this ioctl.
