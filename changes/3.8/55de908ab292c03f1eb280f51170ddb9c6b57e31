mac80211: use channel contexts

Instead of operating on a single channel only,
use the new channel context infrastructure in
all mac80211 code.

This enables drivers that want to use the new
channel context infrastructure to use multiple
channels, while nothing should change for all
the other drivers that don't support it.

Right now this disables both TX power settings
and spatial multiplexing powersave. Both need
to be re-enabled on a channel context basis.

Additionally, when channel contexts are used
drop the connection when channel switch is
received rather than trying to handle it. This
will have to be improved later.
