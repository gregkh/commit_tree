cifs: parse the device name into UNC and prepath

This should fix a regression that was introduced when the new mount
option parser went in. Also, when the unc= and prefixpath= options
are provided, check their values against the ones we parsed from
the device string. If they differ, then throw a warning that tells
the user that we're using the values from the unc= option for now,
but that that will change in 3.10.
