Partially revert "serial: sh-sci: console Runtime PM support"

This partially reverts commit 1ba7622094 (serial: sh-sci: console
Runtime PM support, from Magnus Damm <damm@opensource.se>, 2011-08-03).

The generic 'serial_core' can take care of console PM maintenance,
so all (or at least the first thing) we have to do to get console PM
work properly, is to implement uart_ops ->pm() operation in the sh-sci
serial client driver.

This patch partially reverts the commit above, but leaving sci_reset()
change in place, because sci_reset() is already part of another commit
(73c3d53f38 serial: sh-sci: Avoid FIFO clear for MCE toggle.).

A revised version of console PM support follows next.
