usb: renesas_usbhs: remove debug information from usbhsh_hub_status_data()

Because usbhsh_hub_status_data() will be called many times,
there are too many obstructive/useless debug informations if driver has #define DEBUG.
Thus, other important dev_dbg() information will hide.
This patch removed obstructive/useless dev_dbg().
