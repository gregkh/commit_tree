tuntap: allow polling/writing/reading when detached

We forbid polling, writing and reading when the file were detached, this may
complex the user in several cases:

- when guest pass some buffers to vhost/qemu and then disable some queues,
  host/qemu needs to do its own cleanup on those buffers which is complex
  sometimes. We can do this simply by allowing a user can still write to an
  disabled queue. Write to an disabled queue will cause the packet pass to the
  kernel and read will get nothing.
- align the polling behavior with macvtap which never fails when the queue is
  created. This can simplify the polling errors handling of its user (e.g vhost)

We can simply achieve this by don't assign NULL to tfile->tun when detached.
