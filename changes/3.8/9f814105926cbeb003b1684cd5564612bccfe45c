ALSA: usb-audio: add control index offset

Currently, channel IDs exceeding 31 (0x1f) cannot be used.
The channel ID is derived from the cmask. Extending cmask
to a 64-bit type would only allow it to go up to 63 (0x3f).
Some devices have channel IDs exceeding that as well.
To address that, add an offset to the mixer element which
is then accounted for in the UAC set/get functions.
