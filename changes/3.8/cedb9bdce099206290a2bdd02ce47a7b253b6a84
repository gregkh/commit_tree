vhost-net: skip head management if no outstanding

For short packets zerocopy mode adds overhead
of managing heads which isn't necessary: we
could simly update used ring directly
same as with zerocopy disabled.

Things seem to run a bit faster if we detect
and bypass head management when zcopy isn't used.
