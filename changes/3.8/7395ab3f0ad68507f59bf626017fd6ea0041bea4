staging: comedi: addi_apci_3200: fix digital input 'insn_bits' function

This driver does not follow the comedi API. The digital input 'insn_bits'
function is supposed to return the status of all the input channels in
data[1]. Currently this function uses the data[0] parameter to determine
if a single channel or all thei nput channels are being read. The status
is then being returned in data[0].

Fix the function so it works like the comedi core expects. The core can
then use the function to emulate the 'insn_read' function for individual
channels.
