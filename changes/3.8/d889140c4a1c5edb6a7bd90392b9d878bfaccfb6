rbd: implement feature checks

Version 2 images have two sets of feature bit fields.  The first
indicates features possibly used by the image.  The second indicates
features that the client *must* support in order to use the image.

When an image (or snapshot) is first examined, we need to make sure
that the local implementation supports the image's required
features.  If not, fail the probe for the image.
