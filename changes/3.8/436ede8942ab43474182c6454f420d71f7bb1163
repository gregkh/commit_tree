PM / QoS: Document request manipulation requirement for flags

In fact, the callers of dev_pm_qos_add_request(),
dev_pm_qos_update_request() and dev_pm_qos_remove_request() for
requests of type DEV_PM_QOS_FLAGS need to ensure that the target
device is not RPM_SUSPENDED before using any of these functions (or
be prepared for the new PM QoS flags to take effect after the device
has been resumed).  Document this in their kerneldoc comments.
