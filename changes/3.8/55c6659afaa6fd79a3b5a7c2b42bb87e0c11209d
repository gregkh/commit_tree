srcu: Add DEFINE_SRCU()

In old days, we had two different API sets for dynamic-allocated per-CPU
data and DEFINE_PER_CPU()-defined per_cpu data, and because SRCU used
dynamic-allocated per-CPU data, its srcu_struct structures cannot be
declared statically.  This commit therefore introduces DEFINE_SRCU()
and DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU() to allow statically declared SRCU structures,
using the new static per-CPU interfaces.
