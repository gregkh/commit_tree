sparc64: clear syscall_noerror on the entry to syscall, not on the exit

Move that sucker to just before TI_FPDEPTH and replace stb with sth in
etrap_save().  Take current_ds to its old place, so that we don't push
wsaved into TI_... flags.  That allows to lose clearing syscall_noerror
on return from syscall.
