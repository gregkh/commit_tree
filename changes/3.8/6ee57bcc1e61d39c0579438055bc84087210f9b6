virtio-net: correct capacity math on ring full

Capacity math on ring full is wrong: we are
looking at num_sg but that might be optimistic
because of indirect buffer use.

The implementation also penalizes fast path
with extra memory accesses for the benefit of
ring full condition handling which is slow path.

It's easy to query ring capacity so let's do just that.

This change also makes it easier to move vnet header
for tx around as follow-up patch does.
