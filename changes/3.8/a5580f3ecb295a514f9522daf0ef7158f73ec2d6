perf ui: Add ui_progress__finish()

Sometimes we need to know when the progress bar should disappear.

Checking curr >= total wasn't enough since there're cases not met that
condition for the last call.

So add a new ->finish callback to identify this explicitly.  Currently
only GTK frontend needs it.
