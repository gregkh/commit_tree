perf tools: Introduce struct hist_browser_timer

Currently various hist browser functions receive 3 arguments for
refreshing histogram but only used from a few places.  Also it's only
for perf top command so that it can be NULL for other (and probably
most) cases.  Pack them into a struct in order to reduce number of those
unused arguments.

This is a mechanical change and does not intend a functional change.
