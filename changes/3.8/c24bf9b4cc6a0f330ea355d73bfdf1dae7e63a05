CRIS: fix I/O macros

The inb/outb macros for CRIS are broken from a number of points of view,
missing () around parameters and they have an unprotected if statement
in them.  This was breaking the compile of IPMI on CRIS and thus I was
being annoyed by build regressions, so I fixed them.

Plus I don't think they would have worked at all, since the data values
were missing "&" and the outsl had a "3" instead of a "4" for the size.
From what I can tell, this stuff is not used at all, so this can't be
any more broken than it was before, anyway.
