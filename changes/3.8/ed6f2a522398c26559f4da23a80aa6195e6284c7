ARM: perf: consistently use struct perf_event in arm_pmu functions

The arm_pmu functions have wildly varied parameters which can often be
derived from struct perf_event.

This patch changes the arm_pmu function prototypes so that struct
perf_event pointers are passed in preference to fields that can be
derived from the event.
