drbd: Allow to create devices with a minor number > minor_count

The minor_count module/kernel parameter serves to scale the size of drbd's
internal memory pool, but it is no longer a limit for the number of minors or
the minor number.  (Minor numbers can be arbitrarily high within the allowed
limit of 2^20.)
