usb: ftdi_sio: Crucible Technologies COMET Caller ID - pid added

Simple fix to add support for Crucible Technologies COMET Caller ID
USB decoder - a device containing FTDI USB/Serial converter chip,
handling 1200bps CallerID messages decoded from the phone line -
adding correct USB PID is sufficient.

Tested to apply cleanly and work flawlessly against 3.6.9, 3.7.0-rc8
and 3.8.0-rc3 on both amd64 and x86 arches.
