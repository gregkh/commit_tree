xfs: uncached buffer reads need to return an error

With verification being done as an IO completion callback, different
errors can be returned from a read. Uncached reads only return a
buffer or NULL on failure, which means the verification error cannot
be returned to the caller.

Split the error handling for these reads into two - a failure to get
a buffer will still return NULL, but a read error will return a
referenced buffer with b_error set rather than NULL. The caller is
responsible for checking the error state of the buffer returned.
