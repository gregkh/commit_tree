mm: dmapool: use provided gfp flags for all dma_alloc_coherent() calls

dmapool always calls dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_ATOMIC flag,
regardless the flags provided by the caller. This causes excessive
pruning of emergency memory pools without any good reason. Additionaly,
on ARM architecture any driver which is using dmapools will sooner or
later  trigger the following error:
"ERROR: 256 KiB atomic DMA coherent pool is too small!
Please increase it with coherent_pool= kernel parameter!".
Increasing the coherent pool size usually doesn't help much and only
delays such error, because all GFP_ATOMIC DMA allocations are always
served from the special, very limited memory pool.

This patch changes the dmapool code to correctly use gfp flags provided
by the dmapool caller.
