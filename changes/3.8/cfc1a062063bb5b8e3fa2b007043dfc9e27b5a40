    drm/i915: Initialize LVDS and eDP outputs before anything else

    This makes them sort to the front in X, which makes them likely to be
    the primary outputs if you haven't specified a preference in your DE,
    which is likely to be what you want.

Sorting the connector list after the fact is much easier than trying
to be clever with the init sequence.
