new helper: compat_user_stack_pointer()

Compat counterpart of current_user_stack_pointer(); for most of the biarch
architectures those two are identical, but e.g. arm64 and arm use different
registers for stack pointer...

Note that amd64 variants of current_user_stack_pointer/compat_user_stack_pointer
do *not* rely on pt_regs having been through FIXUP_TOP_OF_STACK.
