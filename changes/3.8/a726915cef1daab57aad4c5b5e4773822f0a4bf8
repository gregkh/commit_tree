    drm/i915: disable opregion lid detection for now

but leaves the autodetect mode disabled. There's also the explicit lid
status option added in

    drm/i915: Add a module parameter to ignore lid status

Which overloaded the meaning for the panel_ignore_lid parameter even
more. To fix up this mess, give the non-negative numbers 0,1 the
original meaning back and use negative numbers to force a given state.
So now we have

1  - disable autodetect, return unknown
0  - enable autodetect
-1 - force to disconnected/lid closed
-2 - force to connected/lid open

v2: My C programmer license has been revoked ...

v3: Beautify the code a bit, as suggested by Chris Wilson.
