ext4: check dioread_nolock on remount

Currently we allow enabling dioread_nolock mount option on remount for
filesystems where blocksize < PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.  This isn't really
supported so fix the bug by moving the check for blocksize !=
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE into parse_options(). Change the original PAGE_SIZE to
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE along the way because that's what we are really
interested in.
