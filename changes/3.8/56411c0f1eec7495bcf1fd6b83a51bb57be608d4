[media] ene-ir: Fix cleanup on probe failure

This makes the cleanup on probe failure more consistent with other
drivers. This is similar to what commit
f27b853ea24a9b70585f9251384d97929e6551c3 ("[media] rc: Fix invalid
free_region and/or free_irq on probe failure") did for some other
drivers.
In addition to making the cleanup more consistent, this also fixes a
case where (on a ene_hw_detect failure) free_region would be called on a
region that was not requested yet.
This last problem was probably introduced by the moving of code in
commit b31b021988fed9e3741a46918f14ba9b063811db ("[media] ene_ir: Fix
driver initialisation") and commit
9ef449c6b31bb6a8e6dedc24de475a3b8c79be20 ("[media] rc: Postpone ISR
registration").
