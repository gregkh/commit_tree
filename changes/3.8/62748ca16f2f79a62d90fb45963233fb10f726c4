Bluetooth: Fix sending L2CAP Create Chan Req

When receiving Physical Link Completed event we need to create L2CAP
channel with L2CAP Create Chan Request. Current code was sending
this command only if connection was pending (which is probably
needed in channel move case). If channel is not moved but created
Create Chan should be sent for outgoing channel which is checked
with BT_CONNECT flag.
