mm/hugetlb.c: fix warning on freeing hwpoisoned hugepage

Fix the warning from __list_del_entry() which is triggered when a process
tries to do free_huge_page() for a hwpoisoned hugepage.

free_huge_page() can be called for hwpoisoned hugepage from
unpoison_memory().  This function gets refcount once and clears
PageHWPoison, and then puts refcount twice to return the hugepage back to
free pool.  The second put_page() finally reaches free_huge_page().
