sctp: Change defaults on cookie hmac selection

Recently I posted commit 3c68198e75 which made selection of the cookie hmac
algorithm selectable.  This is all well and good, but Linus noted that it
changes the default config:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=135536629004808&w=2

I've modified the sctp Kconfig file to reflect the recommended way of making
this choice, using the thermal driver example specified, and brought the
defaults back into line with the way they were prior to my origional patch

Also, on Linus' suggestion, re-adding ability to select default 'none' hmac
algorithm, so we don't needlessly bloat the kernel by forcing a non-none
default.  This also led me to note that we won't honor the default none
condition properly because of how sctp_net_init is encoded.  Fix that up as
well.

Tested by myself (allbeit fairly quickly).  All configuration combinations seems
to work soundly.
