mtd: map: Fix compilation warning

This patch is an attempt to fix following compilation warning.

In file included from drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_cmdset_0001.c:35:0:
drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_cmdset_0001.c: In function 'cfi_intelext_write_words':
include/linux/mtd/map.h:331:11: warning: 'r.x[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

I could have used uninitialized_var() too, but didn't used it as the final else
part of map_word_load() is missing. So there is a chance that it might be passed
uninitialized. Better initialize to zero.
