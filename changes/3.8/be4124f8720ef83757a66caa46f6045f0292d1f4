f2fs: fix the compiler warning for uninitialized use of variable

When CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE is enabled in the kernel, -Os optimisation
flag is passed to gcc for compilation, and somehow while trying to optimize
the code, compiler is might not able to see the initialisation of variable
ne struct variable inside the get_node_info() function and results into
following warning:

fs/f2fs/node.c: In function 'get_node_info':
fs/f2fs/node.c:175:3: warning: 'ne.block_addr' may be used uninitialized in
this function [-Wuninitialized]
fs/f2fs/node.c:265:24: note: 'ne.block_addr' was declared here
fs/f2fs/node.c:176:3: warning: 'ne.ino' may be used uninitialized in this
function [-Wuninitialized]
fs/f2fs/node.c:265:24: note: 'ne.ino' was declared here
fs/f2fs/node.c:177:3: warning: 'ne.version' may be used uninitialized in
this function [-Wuninitialized]
fs/f2fs/node.c:265:24: note: 'ne.version' was declared here

Hence, lets initialise the ne struct variable to zero, which will remove
this warning and also doing this does not seems to making any impact on the
code behavior.
