drm/i915: set FDI_RX_MISC to recommended values on CPT/PPT

My machine here has the correct ones already, but better safe
than sorry. IBX has different settings for that register, and
on IBX the device defaults match the recommended values. Hence
I did not add the respective writes for IBX.

LPT needs the same settings, but that has been done already
