GFS2: Add Orlov allocator

Just like ext3, this works on the root directory and any directory
with the +T flag set. Also, just like ext3, any subdirectory created
in one of the just mentioned cases will be allocated to a random
resource group (GFS2 equivalent of a block group).

If you are creating a set of directories, each of which will contain a
job running on a different node, then by setting +T on the parent
directory before creating the subdirectories, each will land up in a
different resource group, and thus resource group contention between
nodes will be kept to a minimum.
