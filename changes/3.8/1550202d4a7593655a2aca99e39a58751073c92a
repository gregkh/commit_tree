OMAPDSS: manage framedone irq with mgr ops

Some of the output drivers need to handle FRAMEDONE interrupt from
DISPC. This creates a direct dependency to dispc code, and we need to
avoid this to make the compat code to work.

Instead of the output drivers registering for dispc interrupts, we
create new mgr-ops that are used to register a framedone handler. The
code implementing the mgr-ops is responsible for calling the handler
when DISPC FRAMEDONE interrupt happens. The compat layer is improved
accordingly to do the call to the framedone handler.
