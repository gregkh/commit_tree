Revert "nfsd: warn on odd reply state in nfsd_vfs_read"

This reverts commit 79f77bf9a4e3dd5ead006b8f17e7c4ff07d8374e.

This is obviously wrong, and I have no idea how I missed seeing the
warning in testing: I must just not have looked at the right logs.  The
caller bumps rq_resused/rq_next_page, so it will always be hit on a
large enough read.
