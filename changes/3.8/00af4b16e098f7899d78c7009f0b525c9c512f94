extcon: max77693: Fix incorrect error check and return value

irq_create_mapping() returns 0 if it fails to provide a valid irq number.
'ret' needs to be updated with a negative error code before returning from
probe to signal probe failure. While at it, also corrected the 'virq' type to
unsigned from signed.
