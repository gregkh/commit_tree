ath9k: fix rx flush handling

Right now the rx flush is not doing anything useful on AR9003+, as it only
works if the buffers in the rx FIFO have not been purged yet, as is done
by ath_stoprecv.

To fix this, always call ath_flushrecv from within ath_stoprecv before
the FIFO is emptied, but still after the hw receive path has been stopped.

This ensures that frames received (and ACKed by the hardware) shortly before
a reset will be seen by the software, which should improve A-MPDU session
stability.
