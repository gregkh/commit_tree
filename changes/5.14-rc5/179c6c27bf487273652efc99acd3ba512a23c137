KVM: SVM: Fix off-by-one indexing when nullifying last used SEV VMCB

Use the raw ASID, not ASID-1, when nullifying the last used VMCB when
freeing an SEV ASID.  The consumer, pre_sev_run(), indexes the array by
the raw ASID, thus KVM could get a false negative when checking for a
different VMCB if KVM manages to reallocate the same ASID+VMCB combo for
a new VM.

Note, this cannot cause a functional issue _in the current code_, as
pre_sev_run() also checks which pCPU last did VMRUN for the vCPU, and
last_vmentry_cpu is initialized to -1 during vCPU creation, i.e. is
guaranteed to mismatch on the first VMRUN.  However, prior to commit
8a14fe4f0c54 ("kvm: x86: Move last_cpu into kvm_vcpu_arch as
last_vmentry_cpu"), SVM tracked pCPU on its own and zero-initialized the
last_cpu variable.  Thus it's theoretically possible that older versions
of KVM could miss a TLB flush if the first VMRUN is on pCPU0 and the ASID
and VMCB exactly match those of a prior VM.
