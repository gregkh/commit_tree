KVM: arm64: Don't zero the cycle count register when PMCR_EL0.P is set

According to ARM DDI 0487G.a, page D13-3895, setting the PMCR_EL0.P bit to
1 has the following effect:

"Reset all event counters accessible in the current Exception level, not
including PMCCNTR_EL0, to zero."

Similar behaviour is described for AArch32 on page G8-7022. Make it so.
