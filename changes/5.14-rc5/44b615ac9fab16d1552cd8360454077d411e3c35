arm64: dts: renesas: Add missing opp-suspend properties

Tag the highest "Power Optimized" (1.5 GHz) Cortex-A57 operating point
table entries for the RZ/G2M, R-Car M3-W and M3-W+ SoCs with the
"opp-suspend" property.  This makes sure the system will enter suspend
in the same performance state as it will be resumed by the firmware
later, avoiding state inconsistencies after resume.

Based on a patch for R-Car M3-W in the BSP by Takeshi Kihara
<takeshi.kihara.df@renesas.com>.
