nvme-fabrics: Move NVMF_ALLOWED_OPTS and NVMF_REQUIRED_OPTS definitions

Move NVMF_ALLOWED_OPTS and NVMF_REQUIRED_OPTS definitions
to header file, so it can be used by the different HW devices.

NVMeTCP offload devices might have different limitations of the
allowed options, for example, a device that does not support all the
queue types. With tcp and rdma, only the nvme-tcp and nvme-rdma layers
handle those attributes and the HW devices do not create any limitations
for the allowed options.

An alternative design could be to add separate fields in
nvme_tcp_ofld_ops such as max_hw_sectors and max_segments that
we already have in this series.
