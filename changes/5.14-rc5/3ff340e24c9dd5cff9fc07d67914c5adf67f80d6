bus: ti-sysc: Fix gpt12 system timer issue with reserved status

Jarkko Nikula <jarkko.nikula@bitmer.com> reported that Beagleboard
revision c2 stopped booting. Jarkko bisected the issue down to
commit 6cfcd5563b4f ("clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Fix suspend
and resume for am3 and am4").

Let's fix the issue by tagging system timers as reserved rather than
ignoring them. And let's not probe any interconnect target module child
devices for reserved modules.

This allows PM runtime to keep track of clocks and clockdomains for
the interconnect target module, and prevent the system timer from idling
as we already have SYSC_QUIRK_NO_IDLE and SYSC_QUIRK_NO_IDLE_ON_INIT
flags set for system timers.
