ARM: imx: common: Move prototype outside the SMP block

Currently the imx_gpcv2_set_core1_pdn_pup_by_software() prototype is
guarded by the CONFIG_SMP symbol. This causes W=1 build warnings when
CONFIG_SMP is not selected:

arch/arm/mach-imx/src.c:103:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'imx_gpcv2_set_core1_pdn_pup_by_software' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

Fix it by moving the imx_gpcv2_set_core1_pdn_pup_by_software() prototype
outside of the CONFIG_SMP block.
