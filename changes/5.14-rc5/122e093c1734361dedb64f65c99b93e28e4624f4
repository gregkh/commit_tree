mm/page_alloc: fix memory map initialization for descending nodes

On systems with memory nodes sorted in descending order, for instance Dell
Precision WorkStation T5500, the struct pages for higher PFNs and
respectively lower nodes, could be overwritten by the initialization of
struct pages corresponding to the holes in the memory sections.

For example for the below memory layout

[    0.245624] Early memory node ranges
[    0.248496]   node   1: [mem 0x0000000000001000-0x0000000000090fff]
[    0.251376]   node   1: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000dbdf8fff]
[    0.254256]   node   1: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x0000001423ffffff]
[    0.257144]   node   0: [mem 0x0000001424000000-0x0000002023ffffff]

the range 0x1424000000 - 0x1428000000 in the beginning of node 0 starts in
the middle of a section and will be considered as a hole during the
initialization of the last section in node 1.

The wrong initialization of the memory map causes panic on boot when
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is enabled.

Reorder loop order of the memory map initialization so that the outer loop
will always iterate over populated memory regions in the ascending order
and the inner loop will select the zone corresponding to the PFN range.

This way initialization of the struct pages for the memory holes will be
always done for the ranges that are actually not populated.
