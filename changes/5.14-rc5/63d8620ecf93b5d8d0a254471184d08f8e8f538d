mm/swapfile: use percpu_ref to serialize against concurrent swapoff

Patch series "close various race windows for swap", v6.

When I was investigating the swap code, I found some possible race
windows.  This series aims to fix all these races.  But using current
get/put_swap_device() to guard against concurrent swapoff for
swap_readpage() looks terrible because swap_readpage() may take really
long time.  And to reduce the performance overhead on the hot-path as much
as possible, it appears we can use the percpu_ref to close this race
window(as suggested by Huang, Ying).  The patch 1 adds percpu_ref support
for swap and most of the remaining patches try to use this to close
various race windows.  More details can be found in the respective
changelogs.

This patch (of 4):

Using current get/put_swap_device() to guard against concurrent swapoff
for some swap ops, e.g.  swap_readpage(), looks terrible because they
might take really long time.  This patch adds the percpu_ref support to
serialize against concurrent swapoff(as suggested by Huang, Ying).  Also
we remove the SWP_VALID flag because it's used together with RCU solution.
