clk: meson: regmap: switch to determine_rate for the dividers

This increases the maxmium supported frequency on 32-bit systems from
2^31 (signed long as used by clk_ops.round_rate, maximum value:
approx. 2.14GHz) to 2^32 (unsigned long as used by
clk_ops.determine_rate, maximum value: approx. 4.29GHz).
On Meson8/8b/8m2 the HDMI PLL and it's OD (post-dividers) are
capable of running at up to 2.97GHz. So switch the divider
implementation in clk-regmap to clk_ops.determine_rate to support these
higher frequencies on 32-bit systems.
