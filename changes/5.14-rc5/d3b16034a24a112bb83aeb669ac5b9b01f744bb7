seq_buf: Fix overflow in seq_buf_putmem_hex()

There's two variables being increased in that loop (i and j), and i
follows the raw data, and j follows what is being written into the buffer.
We should compare 'i' to MAX_MEMHEX_BYTES or compare 'j' to HEX_CHARS.
Otherwise, if 'j' goes bigger than HEX_CHARS, it will overflow the
destination buffer.
