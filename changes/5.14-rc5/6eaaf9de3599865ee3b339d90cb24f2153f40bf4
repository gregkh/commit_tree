powerpc/64s/interrupt: Check and fix srr_valid without crashing

The PPC_RFI_SRR_DEBUG check added by patch "powerpc/64s: avoid reloading
(H)SRR registers if they are still valid" has a few deficiencies. It
does not fix the actual problem, it's not enabled by default, and it
causes a program check interrupt which can cause more difficulties.

However there are a lot of paths which may clobber SRRs or change return
regs, and difficult to have a high confidence that all paths are covered
without wider testing.

Add a relatively low overhead always-enabled check that catches most
such cases, reports once, and fixes it so the kernel can continue.
