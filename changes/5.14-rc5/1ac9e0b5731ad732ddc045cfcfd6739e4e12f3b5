perf cs-etm: Set time on synthesised samples to preserve ordering

The following attribute is set when synthesising samples in
timed decoding mode:

    attr.sample_type |= PERF_SAMPLE_TIME;

This results in new samples that appear to have timestamps but
because we don't assign any timestamps to the samples, when the
resulting inject file is opened again, the synthesised samples
will be on the wrong side of the MMAP or COMM events.

For example, this results in the samples being associated with
the perf binary, rather than the target of the record:

    perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u top
    perf inject -i perf.data -o perf.inject --itrace=i100il
    perf report -i perf.inject

Where 'Command' == perf should show as 'top':

    # Overhead  Command  Source Shared Object  Source Symbol           Target Symbol           Basic Block Cycles
    # ........  .......  ....................  ......................  ......................  ..................
    #
        31.08%  perf     [unknown]             [.] 0x000000000040c3f8  [.] 0x000000000040c3e8  -

If the perf.data file is opened directly with perf, without the
inject step, then this already works correctly because the
events are synthesised after the COMM and MMAP events and
no second sorting happens. Re-sorting only happens when opening
the perf.inject file for the second time so timestamps are
needed.

Using the timestamp from the AUX record mirrors the current
behaviour when opening directly with perf, because the events
are generated on the call to cs_etm__process_queues().

The ETM trace could optionally contain time stamps, but there is
no way to correlate this with the kernel time. So, the best available
time value is that of the AUX_RECORD header. This patch uses
the timestamp from the header for all the samples. The ordering of the
samples are implicit in the trace and thus is fine with respect to
relative ordering.
