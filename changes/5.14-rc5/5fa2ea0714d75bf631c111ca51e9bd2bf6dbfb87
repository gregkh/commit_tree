s390/mcck: move register validation to C code

This update partially reverts commit 3037a52f9846 ("s390/nmi:
do register validation as early as possible").

Storage error checks and control registers validation are left
in the assembler code, since correct ASCEs and page tables are
required to enable DAT - which is done before the C handler is
entered.

System damage, kernel instruction address and PSW MWP checks
are left in the assembler code as well, since there is no way
to proceed if one of these checks is failed.

The getcpu vdso syscall reads CPU number from the programmable
field of the TOD clock. Disregard the TOD programmable register
validity bit and load the CPU number into the TOD programmable
field unconditionally.
