Makefile: Enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang

With the recent fixes for fallthrough warnings, it is now possible to
enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang.

It's important to mention that since we have adopted the use of the
pseudo-keyword macro fallthrough; we also want to avoid having more
/* fall through */ comments being introduced. Notice that contrary
to GCC, Clang doesn't recognize any comments as implicit fall-through
markings when the -Wimplicit-fallthrough option is enabled. So, in
order to avoid having more comments being introduced, we have to use
the option -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5 for GCC, which similar to Clang,
will cause a warning in case a code comment is intended to be used
as a fall-through marking.
