clk: rockchip: fix rk3568 cpll clk gate bits

The cpll clk gate bits had an ordering issue. This led to the loss of
the boot sdmmc controller when the gmac was shut down with:
`ip link set eth0 down`
as the cpll_100m was shut off instead of the cpll_62p5.
cpll_62p5, cpll_50m, cpll_25m were all off by one with cpll_100m
misplaced.
