net: dsa: replay the local bridge FDB entries pointing to the bridge dev too

When we join a bridge that already has some local addresses pointing to
itself, we do not get those notifications. Similarly, when we leave that
bridge, we do not get notifications for the deletion of those entries.
The only switchdev notifications we get are those of entries added while
the DSA port is enslaved to the bridge.

This makes use cases such as the following work properly (with the
number of additions and removals properly balanced):

ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link add br1 type bridge
ip link set br0 address 00:01:02:03:04:05
ip link set br1 address 00:01:02:03:04:05
ip link set swp0 up
ip link set swp1 up
ip link set swp0 master br0
ip link set swp1 master br1
ip link set br0 up
ip link set br1 up
ip link del br1 # 00:01:02:03:04:05 still installed on the CPU port
ip link del br0 # 00:01:02:03:04:05 finally removed from the CPU port
