powerpc/powernv/pci: fix header guard

While looking at -Wundef warnings, the #if CONFIG_EEH stood out as a
possible candidate to convert to #ifdef CONFIG_EEH.

It seems that based on Kconfig dependencies it's not possible to build
this file without CONFIG_EEH enabled, but based on upstream discussion,
it's not clear yet that CONFIG_EEH should be enabled by default.

For now, simply fix the -Wundef warning.
