ALSA: bebob: dismiss sleep after breaking connections

In a commit d3eabe939aee ("ALSA: bebob: expand sleep just after breaking
connections for protocol version 1"), a workaround was added for a quirk
of freeze in BeBoB protocol version 1. As long as seeing with sequence
replay for media clock recovery, the quirk disappears.

This commit removes the workaround.
