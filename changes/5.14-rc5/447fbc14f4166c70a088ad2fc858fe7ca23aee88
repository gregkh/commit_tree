staging: vchiq_core: fix logic in poll_services_of_group

Commit "staging: vchiq_core: avoid indention in poll_services_of_group"
tries to reduce the indention, but the parts regarding the third if statement
breaks the logic. So restore them and prevent vchiq_test from hanging during
the ping test.
