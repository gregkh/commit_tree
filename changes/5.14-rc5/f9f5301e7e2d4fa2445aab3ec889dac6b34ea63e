Register ice client auxiliary RDMA device on the auxiliary bus per
PCIe device function for the auxiliary driver (irdma) to attach to.
It allows to realize a single RDMA driver (irdma) capable of working with
multiple netdev drivers over multi-generation Intel HW supporting RDMA.
There is no load ordering dependencies between ice and irdma.
