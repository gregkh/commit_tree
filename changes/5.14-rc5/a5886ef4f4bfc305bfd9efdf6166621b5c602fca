gve: Introduce per netdev `enum gve_queue_format`

The currently supported queue formats are:
- GQI_RDA - GQI with raw DMA addressing
- GQI_QPL - GQI with queue page list
- DQO_RDA - DQO with raw DMA addressing

The old `gve_priv.raw_addressing` value is only used for GQI_RDA, so we
remove it in favor of just checking against GQI_RDA
