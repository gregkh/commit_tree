torture: Fix grace-period rate output

The kvm-again.sh script relies on shell comments added to the qemu-cmd
file, but this means that code extracting values from the QEMU command in
this file must grep out those commment.  Which kvm-recheck-rcu.sh failed
to do, which destroyed its grace-period-per-second calculation.  This
commit therefore adds the needed "grep -v '^#'" to kvm-recheck-rcu.sh.
