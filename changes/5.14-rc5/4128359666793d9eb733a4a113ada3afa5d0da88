drm/i915: Use the correct max source link rate for MST

[why]
Previously used value was not safe to provide the correct value, i.e. it
could be 0 if not not configured, leading to no MST on this platform.

[how]
Do not use the value from BIOS, but from the structure populated at
encoder initialization time.
