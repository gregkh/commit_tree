drm/amd/display: Fix updating infoframe for DCN3.1 eDP

[Why]
We're only treating TMDS as a valid target for infoframe updates which
results in PSR being unable to transition from state 4 to state 5.

[How]
Also allow infoframe updates for DCN3.1 - following how we handle
this path for earlier ASIC as well.
