docs: dt: remove stale property-units.txt, link to current schema

property-units.txt is not maintained anymore. New suffixes are now
supported that have not been added here.

To avoid people incorrectly think a given suffix is not in the list remove
the file entirely and point to the authoritative place where the
recommended suffixes are maintained.
