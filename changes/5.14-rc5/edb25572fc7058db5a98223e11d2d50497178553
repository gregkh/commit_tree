mmc: core: Use kref in place of struct mmc_blk_data::usage

Ulf reported the following KASAN splat after adding some manual hacks
into mmc-utils[1].

Looking closer at the problem, it looks like a classic dangling pointer
bug. The 'struct mmc_blk_data' that is used after being freed in
mmc_blk_put() is stashed away in 'md->disk->private_data' via
mmc_blk_alloc_req() but used in mmc_blk_get() because the 'usage' count
isn't properly aligned with the lifetime of the pointer. You'd expect
the 'usage' member to be in sync with the kfree(), and it mostly is,
except that mmc_blk_get() needs to dereference the potentially freed
memory storage for the 'struct mmc_blk_data' stashed away in the
private_data member to look at 'usage' before it actually figures out if
it wants to consider it a valid pointer or not. That's not going to work
if the freed memory has been overwritten by something else after the
free, and KASAN rightly complains here.

To fix the immediate problem, let's set the private_data member to NULL
in mmc_blk_put() so that mmc_blk_get() can consider the object "on the
way out" if the pointer is NULL and not even try to look at 'usage' if
the object isn't going to be around much longer. With that set to NULL
on the last mmc_blk_put(), optimize the get path further and use a kref
underneath the 'open_lock' mutex to only up the reference count if it's
non-zero, i.e.  alive, and otherwise make mmc_blk_get() return NULL,
without actually testing the reference count if we're in the process of
removing the object from the system.

Finally, tighten the locking region on the put side to only be around
the parts that are removing the 'mmc_blk_data' from the system and
publishing that fact to the gendisk and then drop the lock as soon as we
can to avoid holding the lock around code that doesn't need it. This
fixes the KASAN issue.
