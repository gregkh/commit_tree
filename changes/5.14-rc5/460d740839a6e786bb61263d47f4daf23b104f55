platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add support for 13" Intel Surface Laptop 4

Add support for the 13" Intel version of the Surface Laptop 4.

Use the existing node group for the Surface Laptop 3 since the 15" AMD
version already shares its WSID HID with its predecessor and there don't
seem to be any significant differences with regards to SAM.
