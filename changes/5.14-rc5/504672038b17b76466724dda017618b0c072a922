net: wwan: core: purge rx queue on port close

Purge the rx queue as soon as a user closes the port, just after the
port stop callback invocation. This is to prevent feeding a user that
will open the port next time with outdated and possibly unrelated
data.

While at it also remove the odd skb_queue_purge() call in the port
device destroy callback. The queue will be purged just before the
callback is ivoncated in the wwan_remove_port() function.
