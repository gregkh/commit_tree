iwlwifi: mvm: apply RX diversity per PHY context

SMPS requests may differ per interfaces due to e.g. Bluetooth
only interfering on 2.4 GHz, so if that's the case we should,
in the case of multiple PHY contexts, still allow RX diversity
on PHY context that have no interfaces with SMPS requests.

Fix the code to pass through the PHY context in question and
skip interfaces with non-matching PHY context while iterating.
