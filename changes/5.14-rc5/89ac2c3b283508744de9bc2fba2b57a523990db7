scsi: ufs: core: Let UPIU completion trace print RSP UPIU header

The current UPIU completion event trace still prints the COMMAND UPIU
header, rather than the RSP UPIU header. This makes UPIU command trace
useless in problem shooting in case we receive a trace log from the
customer/field.

There are two important fields in RSP UPIU:

 1. The response field, which indicates the UFS defined overall success or
    failure of the series of Command, Data and RESPONSE UPIUâ€™s that make up
    the execution of a task.

2. The Status field, which contains the command set specific status for a
    specific command issued by the initiator device.

Before this commit, the UPIU paired trace events:
