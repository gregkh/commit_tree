random32: Fix implicit truncation warning in prandom_seed_state()

sparse generates the following warning:

 include/linux/prandom.h:114:45: sparse: sparse: cast truncates bits from
 constant value

This is because the 64-bit seed value is manipulated and then placed in a
u32, causing an implicit cast and truncation. A forced cast to u32 doesn't
prevent this warning, which is reasonable because a typecast doesn't prove
that truncation was expected.

Logical-AND the value with 0xffffffff to make explicit that truncation to
32-bit is intended.
