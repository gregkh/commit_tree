ACPI: PM: Only mark EC GPE for wakeup on Intel systems

When using s2idle on a variety of AMD notebook systems, they are
experiencing spurious events that the EC or SMU are in the wrong
state leading to a hard time waking up or higher than expected
power consumption.

These events only occur when the EC GPE is inadvertently set as a wakeup
source. Originally the EC GPE was only set as a wakeup source when using
the intel-vbtn or intel-hid drivers in commit 10a08fd65ec1 ("ACPI: PM:
Set up EC GPE for system wakeup from drivers that need it") but during
testing a reporter discovered that this was not enough for their ASUS
Zenbook UX430UNR/i7-8550U to wakeup by lid event or keypress.
Marking the EC GPE for wakeup universally resolved this for that
reporter in commit b90ff3554aa3 ("ACPI: PM: s2idle: Always set up EC GPE
for system wakeup").

However this behavior has lead to a number of problems:

 * On both Lenovo T14 and P14s the keyboard wakeup doesn't work, and
   sometimes the power button event doesn't work.
 * On HP 635 G7 detaching or attaching AC during suspend will cause
   the system not to wakeup
 * On Asus vivobook to prevent detaching AC causing resume problems
 * On Lenovo 14ARE05 to prevent detaching AC causing resume problems
 * On HP ENVY x360  to prevent detaching AC causing resume problems

As there may be other Intel systems besides ASUS Zenbook UX430UNR/i7-8550U
that don't use intel-vbtn or intel-hid, avoid these problems by only
universally marking the EC GPE wakesource on non-AMD systems.
