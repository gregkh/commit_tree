arm64: Conditionally configure PTR_AUTH key of the kernel.

If the kernel is not compiled with CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH_KERNEL=y,
then no PACI/AUTI instructions are expected while the kernel is running
so the kernel's key will not be used. Write of a system registers
is expensive therefore avoid if not required.
