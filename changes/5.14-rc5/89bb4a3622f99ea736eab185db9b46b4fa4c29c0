n_tty: remove n_tty_receive_char_fast

n_tty_receive_char_fast is a copy of n_tty_receive_char with one
exception: PARMRK is not doubled in the former. Unify these two and
double PARMRK depending on a newly added parameter (bool parmrk_dbl).

I don't think the theoretical speedup is worth the code duplication.
Which is directly connected with maintenance burden.
