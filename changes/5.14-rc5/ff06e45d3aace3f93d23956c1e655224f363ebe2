kfence: unconditionally use unbound work queue

Unconditionally use unbound work queue, and not just if wq_power_efficient
is true.  Because if the system is idle, KFENCE may wait, and by being run
on the unbound work queue, we permit the scheduler to make better
scheduling decisions and not require pinning KFENCE to the same CPU upon
waking up.
