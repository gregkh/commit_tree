bus: mhi: pci_generic: Fix inbound IPCR channel

The qrtr-mhi client driver assumes that inbound buffers are
automatically allocated and queued by the MHI core, but this
doesn't happen for mhi pci devices since IPCR inbound channel is
not flagged with auto_queue, causing unusable IPCR (qrtr)
feature. Fix that.
