dt-bindings: timer: arm,twd: Convert to json-schema

Convert the ARM Timer-Watchdog Device Tree binding documentation to
json-schema.  As the old binding document actually contained two
bindings, it is split in two document: one for the timer part, and one
for the watchdog part.

Document missing properties.
Update examples to match reality.
