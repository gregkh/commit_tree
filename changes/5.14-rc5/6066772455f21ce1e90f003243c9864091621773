KVM: x86/mmu: Add accessors to query mmu_role bits

Add accessors via a builder macro for all mmu_role bits that track a CR0,
CR4, or EFER bit, abstracting whether the bits are in the base or the
extended role.

Future commits will switch to using mmu_role instead of vCPU state to
configure the MMU, i.e. there are about to be a large number of users.
