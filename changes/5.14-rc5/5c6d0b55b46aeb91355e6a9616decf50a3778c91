arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Fix external refclk input to SERDES

Rename the external refclk inputs to the SERDES from
dummy_cmn_refclk/dummy_cmn_refclk1 to cmn_refclk/cmn_refclk1
respectively. Also move the external refclk DT nodes outside the
cbass_main DT node. Since in j721e common processor board, only the
cmn_refclk1 is connected to 100MHz clock, fix the clock frequency.
