docs: checkpatch: Document and segregate more checkpatch message types

Add and document more checkpatch message types. About 50% of all
message types are documented now.

In addition to this:

- Create a new subsection 'Indentation and Line Breaks'.
- Rename subsection 'Comment style' to simply 'Comments'.
- Refactor some of the existing types to appropriate subsections.
