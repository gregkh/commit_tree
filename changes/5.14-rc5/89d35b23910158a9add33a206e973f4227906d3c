KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Implement the rest of the P9 path in C

Almost all logic is moved to C, by introducing a new in_guest mode for
the P9 path that branches very early in the KVM interrupt handler to P9
exit code.

The main P9 entry and exit assembly is now only about 160 lines of low
level stack setup and register save/restore, plus a bad-interrupt
handler.

There are two motivations for this, the first is just make the code more
maintainable being in C. The second is to reduce the amount of code
running in a special KVM mode, "realmode". In quotes because with radix
it is no longer necessarily real-mode in the MMU, but it still has to be
treated specially because it may be in real-mode, and has various
important registers like PID, DEC, TB, etc set to guest. This is hostile
to the rest of Linux and can't use arbitrary kernel functionality or be
instrumented well.

This initial patch is a reasonably faithful conversion of the asm code,
but it does lack any loop to return quickly back into the guest without
switching out of realmode in the case of unimportant or easily handled
interrupts. As explained in previous changes, handling HV interrupts
very quickly in this low level realmode is not so important for P9
performance, and are important to avoid for security, observability,
debugability reasons.
