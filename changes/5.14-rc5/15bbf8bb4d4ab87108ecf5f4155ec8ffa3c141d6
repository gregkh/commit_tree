NIU: fix incorrect error return, missed in previous revert

Commit 7930742d6, reverting 26fd962, missed out on reverting an incorrect
change to a return value.  The niu_pci_vpd_scan_props(..) == 1 case appears
to be a normal path - treating it as an error and return -EINVAL was
breaking VPD_SCAN and causing the driver to fail to load.

Fix, so my Neptune card works again.
