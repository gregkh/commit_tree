PCI: Leave Apple Thunderbolt controllers on for s2idle or standby

On Macbook 2013, resuming from suspend-to-idle or standby resulted in the
external monitor no longer being detected, a stacktrace, and errors like
this in dmesg:

  pcieport 0000:06:00.0: can't change power state from D3hot to D0 (config space inaccessible)

The reason is that we know how to turn power to the Thunderbolt controller
*off* via the SXIO/SXFP/SXLF methods, but we don't know how to turn power
back on.  We have to rely on firmware to turn the power back on.

When going to the "suspend-to-idle" or "standby" system sleep states,
firmware is not involved either on the suspend side or the resume side, so
we can't use SXIO/SXFP/SXLF to turn the power off.

Skip SXIO/SXFP/SXLF when firmware isn't involved in suspend, e.g., when
we're going to the "suspend-to-idle" or "standby" system sleep states.
