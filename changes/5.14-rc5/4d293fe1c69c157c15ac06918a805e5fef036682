bonding: allow nesting of bonding device

The commit 3c9ef511b9fa ("bonding: avoid adding slave device with
IFF_MASTER flag") fix a crash when add slave device with IFF_MASTER,
but it rejects the scenario of nested bonding device.

As Eric Dumazet described: since there indeed is a usage scenario about
nesting bonding, we should not break it.

So we add a new judgment condition to allow nesting of bonding device.
