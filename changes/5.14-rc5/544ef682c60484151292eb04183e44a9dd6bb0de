docs: kernel-parameters: mark numa=off is supported by a bundle of architectures

risc-v and arm64 support numa=off by common arch_numa_init()
in drivers/base/arch_numa.c. x86, ppc, mips, sparc support it
by arch-level early_param.
numa=off is widely used in linux distributions. it is better
to document it.
