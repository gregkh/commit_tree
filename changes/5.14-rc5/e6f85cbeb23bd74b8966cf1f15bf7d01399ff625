arm64: entry: fix KCOV suppression

We suppress KCOV for entry.o rather than entry-common.o. As entry.o is
built from entry.S, this is pointless, and permits instrumentation of
entry-common.o, which is built from entry-common.c.

Fix the Makefile to suppress KCOV for entry-common.o, as we had intended
to begin with. I've verified with objdump that this is working as
expected.
