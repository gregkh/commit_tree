libata: fix ata_pio_sector for CONFIG_HIGHMEM

Data transfers are not required to be block aligned in memory, so they
span two pages.  Fix this by splitting the call to >sff_data_xfer into
two for that case.

This has been broken since the initial libata import before the damn
of git, but was uncovered by the legacy ide driver removal.
