iio: light: vcnl4035: Fix buffer alignment in iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()

Add __aligned(8) to ensure the buffer passed to
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() is suitable for the naturally
aligned timestamp that will be inserted.

Here an explicit structure is not used, because the holes would
necessitate the addition of an explict memset(), to avoid a potential
kernel data leak, making for a less minimal fix.
