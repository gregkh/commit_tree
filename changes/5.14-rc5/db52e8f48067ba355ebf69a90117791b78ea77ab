staging: rtl8723bs: hal: Remove set but unused variables

Removed set but unused variables. Issue detected by GCC running with
the warning option -Wunused-but-set-variable. Removed the storage of
the values returned but left the reads because it is possible
that removing them can prevent the hardware from working properly.
