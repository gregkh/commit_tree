userfaultfd/selftests: use memfd_create for shmem test type

This is a preparatory commit.  In the future, we want to be able to setup
alias mappings for area_src and area_dst in the shmem test, like we do in
the hugetlb_shared test.  With a VMA obtained via mmap(MAP_ANONYMOUS |
MAP_SHARED), it isn't clear how to do this.

So, mmap() with an fd, so we can create alias mappings.  Use memfd_create
instead of actually passing in a tmpfs path like hugetlb does, since it's
more convenient / simpler to run, and works just as well.

Future commits will:

1. Setup the alias mappings.
2. Extend our tests to actually take advantage of this, to test new
   userfaultfd behavior being introduced in this series.

Also, a small fix in the area we're changing: when the hugetlb setup fails
in main(), pass in the right argv[] so we actually print out the hugetlb
file path.
