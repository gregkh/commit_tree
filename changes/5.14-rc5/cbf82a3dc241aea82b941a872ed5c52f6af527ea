objtool: Decode jump_entry::key addend

Teach objtool about the the low bits in the struct static_key pointer.

That is, the low two bits of @key in:

  struct jump_entry {
	s32 code;
	s32 target;
	long key;
  }

as found in the __jump_table section. Since @key has a relocation to
the variable (to be resolved by the linker), the low two bits will be
reflected in the relocation's addend.

As such, find the reloc and store the addend, such that we can access
these bits.
