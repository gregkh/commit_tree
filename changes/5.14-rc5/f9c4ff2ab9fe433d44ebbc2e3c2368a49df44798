arm64: fix the doc of RANDOMIZE_MODULE_REGION_FULL

Obviously kaslr is setting the module region to 2GB rather than 4GB since
commit b2eed9b588112 ("arm64/kernel: kaslr: reduce module randomization
range to 2 GB"). So fix the size of region in Kconfig.
On the other hand, even though RANDOMIZE_MODULE_REGION_FULL is not set,
module_alloc() can fall back to a 2GB window if ARM64_MODULE_PLTS is set.
In this case, veneers are still needed. !RANDOMIZE_MODULE_REGION_FULL
doesn't necessarily mean veneers are not needed.
So fix the doc to be more precise to avoid any confusion to the readers
of the code.
