KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Remove unused nested HV tests in XICS emulation

Commit f3c18e9342a44 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Use XICS hypercalls when
running as a nested hypervisor") added nested HV tests in XICS
hypercalls, but not all are required.

* icp_eoi is only called by kvmppc_deliver_irq_passthru which is only
  called by kvmppc_check_passthru which is only caled by
  kvmppc_read_one_intr.

* kvmppc_read_one_intr is only called by kvmppc_read_intr which is only
  called by the L0 HV rmhandlers code.

* kvmhv_rm_send_ipi is called by:
  - kvmhv_interrupt_vcore which is only called by kvmhv_commence_exit
    which is only called by the L0 HV rmhandlers code.
  - icp_send_hcore_msg which is only called by icp_rm_set_vcpu_irq.
  - icp_rm_set_vcpu_irq which is only called by icp_rm_try_update
  - icp_rm_set_vcpu_irq is not nested HV safe because it writes to
    LPCR directly without a kvmhv_on_pseries test. Nested handlers
    should not in general be using the rm handlers.

The important test seems to be in kvmppc_ipi_thread, which sends the
virt-mode H_IPI handler kick to use smp_call_function rather than
msgsnd.
