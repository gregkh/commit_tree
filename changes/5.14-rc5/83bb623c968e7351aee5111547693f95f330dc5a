bnxt_en: Transmit and retrieve packet timestamps

Setup the TXBD to enable TX timestamp if requested.  At TX packet DMA
completion, if we requested TX timestamp on that packet, we defer to
.do_aux_work() to obtain the TX timestamp from the firmware before we
free the TX SKB.

v2: Use .do_aux_work() to get the TX timestamp from firmware.
