arm64: dts: freescale: Separate each group of data in the property 'reg'

Do not write the 'reg' of multiple groups of data into a uint32 array,
use <> to separate them. Otherwise, the errors similar to the following
will be reported by reg.yaml.

arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1012a-frdm.dt.yaml:
 soc: pcie@3400000:reg:0: \
 [0, 54525952, 0, 1048576, 64, 0, 0, 8192] is too long
