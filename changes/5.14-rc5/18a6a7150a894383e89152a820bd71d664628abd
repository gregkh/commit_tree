clk: tegra: Halve SCLK rate on Tegra20

Higher SCLK rates on Tegra20 require high core voltage. The higher
clock rate may have a positive performance effect only for AHB DMA
transfers and AVP CPU, but both aren't used by upstream kernel at all.
Halve SCLK rate on Tegra20 in order to remove the high core voltage
requirement.
