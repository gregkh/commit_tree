mm/page_alloc: adjust pcp->high after CPU hotplug events

The PCP high watermark is based on the number of online CPUs so the
watermarks must be adjusted during CPU hotplug.  At the time of
hot-remove, the number of online CPUs is already adjusted but during
hot-add, a delta needs to be applied to update PCP to the correct value.
After this patch is applied, the high watermarks are adjusted correctly.

  # grep high: /proc/zoneinfo  | tail -1
              high:  649
  # echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/online
  # grep high: /proc/zoneinfo  | tail -1
              high:  664
  # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/online
  # grep high: /proc/zoneinfo  | tail -1
              high:  649
