driver core: Export device_driver_attach()

This is intended as a replacement API for device_bind_driver(). It has at
least the following benefits:

- Internal locking. Few of the users of device_bind_driver() follow the
  locking rules

- Calls device driver probe() internally. Notably this means that devm
  support for probe works correctly as probe() error will call
  devres_release_all()

- struct device_driver -> dev_groups is supported

- Simplified calling convention, no need to manually call probe().

The general usage is for situations that already know what driver to bind
and need to ensure the bind is synchronized with other logic. Call
device_driver_attach() after device_add().

If probe() returns a failure then this will be preserved up through to the
error return of device_driver_attach().
