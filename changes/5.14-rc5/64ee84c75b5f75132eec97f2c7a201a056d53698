arm64: move warning about toolchains to archprepare

Commit 987fdfec2410 ("arm64: move --fix-cortex-a53-843419 linker test to
Kconfig") fixed the false-positive warning in the installation step.

Yet, there are some cases where this false-positive is shown. For example,
you can see it when you cross 987fdfec2410 during git-bisect.

  $ git checkout 987fdfec2410^
    [ snip ]
  $ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- defconfig all
    [ snip ]
  $ git checkout v5.13
    [ snip]
  $ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- defconfig all
    [ snip ]
  arch/arm64/Makefile:25: ld does not support --fix-cortex-a53-843419; kernel may be susceptible to erratum

In the stale include/config/auto.config, CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_843419=y
is set without CONFIG_ARM64_LD_HAS_FIX_ERRATUM_843419, so the warning
is displayed while parsing the Makefiles.

Make will restart with the updated include/config/auto.config, hence
CONFIG_ARM64_LD_HAS_FIX_ERRATUM_843419 will be set eventually, but
this warning is a surprise for users.

Commit 25896d073d8a ("x86/build: Fix compiler support check for
CONFIG_RETPOLINE") addressed a similar issue.

Move $(warning ...) out of the parse stage of Makefiles.

The same applies to CONFIG_ARM64_USE_LSE_ATOMICS.
