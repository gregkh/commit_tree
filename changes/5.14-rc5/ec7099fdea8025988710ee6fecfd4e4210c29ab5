Revert "gpio: mpc8xxx: change the gpio interrupt flags."

This reverts commit 3d5bfbd9716318b1ca5c38488aa69f64d38a9aa5.

When booting with threadirqs, it causes a splat

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 29 at kernel/irq/handle.c:159 __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x1ec/0x27c
  irq 66 handler irq_default_primary_handler+0x0/0x1c enabled interrupts

That splat later went away with commit 81e2073c175b ("genirq: Disable
interrupts for force threaded handlers"), which got backported to
-stable. However, when running an -rt kernel, the splat still
exists. Moreover, quoting Thomas Gleixner [1]

  But 3d5bfbd97163 ("gpio: mpc8xxx: change the gpio interrupt flags.")
  has nothing to do with that:

      "Delete the interrupt IRQF_NO_THREAD flags in order to gpio interrupts
       can be threaded to allow high-priority processes to preempt."

  This changelog is blatantly wrong. In mainline forced irq threads
  have always been invoked with softirqs disabled, which obviously
  makes them non-preemptible.

So the patch didn't even do what its commit log said.
