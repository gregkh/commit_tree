wcn36xx: Enable WOWLAN flags

Enable flags for

- Magic packet
- GTK rekey

Previous patches implemented the necessary code to switch these two on.
Standalone magic packet absent GTK rekey is pretty useless, so it makes
sense to flag both at once.

Once done it is possible for wcn36xx firmware to

1. Respond to ipv4 and ipv6 ARP/NS lookup requests
2. Bring the system out of suspend when a magic packet is received.
   Magic in our case is a simple ipv4 or ipv6 unicast.
3. GTK rekey whilst in suspend
   Once we wake from suspend the GTK will be updated as necessary
