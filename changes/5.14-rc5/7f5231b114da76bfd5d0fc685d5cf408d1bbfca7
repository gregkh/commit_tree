platform/x86: amd-pmc: Fix undefined reference to __udivdi3

It was reported that on i386 config

------
on i386:

ld: drivers/platform/x86/amd-pmc.o: in function `s0ix_stats_show':
amd-pmc.c:(.text+0x100): undefined reference to `__udivdi3'
-------

The reason for this is that 64-bit integer division is not supported
on 32-bit architecture. Use do_div macro to fix this.
