can: uapi: introduce CANFD_FDF flag for mixed content in struct canfd_frame

The struct can_frame and struct canfd_frame intentionally share the
same layout to be able to write CAN frame content into a CAN FD frame
structure. When this is done the former differentiation via CAN_MTU /
CANFD_MTU is lost. CANFD_FDF allows programmers to mark CAN FD frames
in the case of using struct canfd_frame for mixed CAN/CAN FD
content (dual use).

N.B. the Kernel APIs do NOT provide mixed CAN / CAN FD content inside
of struct canfd_frame therefore the CANFD_FDF flag is disregarded by
Linux.
