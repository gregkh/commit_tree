virtio-mem: don't read big block size in Sub Block Mode

We are reading a Big Block Mode value while in Sub Block Mode
when initializing. Fortunately, vm->bbm.bb_size maps to some counter
in the vm->sbm.mb_count array, which is 0 at that point in time.

No harm done; still, this was unintended and is not future-proof.
