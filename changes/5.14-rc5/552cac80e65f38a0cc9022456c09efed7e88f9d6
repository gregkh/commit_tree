rcu/nocb: Allow de-offloading rdp leader

The only thing that prevented an rdp leader from being de-offloaded was
the nocb_bypass_timer that used to lock the nocb_lock of the rdp leader.

If an rdp gets de-offloaded, it will subtlely ignore rcu_nocb_lock()
calls and do its job in the timer unsafely.  Worse yet:  If it gets
re-offloaded in the middle of the timer, rcu_nocb_unlock() would try to
unlock, leaving it imbalanced.

Now that the nocb_bypass_timer doesn't use the nocb_lock anymore,
de-offloading the rdp leader is now safe.  This commit therefore allows
the rdp leader to be de-offloaded.
