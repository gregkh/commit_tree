pwm: berlin: Don't check the return code of pwmchip_remove()

pwmchip_remove() always returns 0. Don't use the value to make it
possible to eventually change the function to return void. This is a
good thing as pwmchip_remove() is usually called from a remove function
(mostly for platform devices) and their return value is ignored by the
device core anyhow.
