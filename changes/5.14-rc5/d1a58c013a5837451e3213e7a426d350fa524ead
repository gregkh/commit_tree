net: dsa: qca: ar9331: reorder MDIO write sequence

In case of this switch we work with 32bit registers on top of 16bit
bus. Some registers (for example access to forwarding database) have
trigger bit on the first 16bit half of request and the result +
configuration of request in the second half. Without this patch, we would
trigger database operation and overwrite result in one run.

To make it work properly, we should do the second part of transfer
before the first one is done.

So far, this rule seems to work for all registers on this switch.
