ALSA: usb-audio: Fix superfluous autosuspend recovery

The change to restore the autosuspend from the disabled state uses a
wrong check: namely, it should have been the exact comparison of the
quirk_type instead of the bitwise and (&).  Otherwise it matches
wrongly with the other quirk types.

Although re-enabling the autosuspend for the already enabled device
shouldn't matter much, it's better to fix the unbalanced call.
