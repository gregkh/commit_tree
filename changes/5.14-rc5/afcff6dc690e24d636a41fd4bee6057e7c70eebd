usb: gadget: f_hid: added GET_IDLE and SET_IDLE handlers

The USB HID standard declares mandatory support for GET_IDLE and SET_IDLE
requests for Boot Keyboard. Most hosts can handle their absence, but others
like some old/strange UEFIs and BIOSes consider this a critical error
and refuse to work with f_hid.

This primitive implementation of saving and returning idle is sufficient
to meet the requirements of the standard and these devices.
