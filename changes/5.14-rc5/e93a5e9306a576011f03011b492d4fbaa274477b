NFSv4: Add support for application leases underpinned by a delegation

If the NFSv4 client already holds a delegation for a file, then we can
support application leases (i.e. fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE,...)) because the
underlying delegation guarantees that the file is not being modified on
the server by another client in a way that might conflict with the lease
guarantees.
