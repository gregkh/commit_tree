i40e: Fix queue-to-TC mapping on Tx

In SW DCB mode the packets sent receive incorrect UP tags. They are
constructed correctly and put into tx_ring, but UP is later remapped by
HW on the basis of TCTUPR register contents according to Tx queue
selected, and BW used is consistent with the new UP values. This is
caused by Tx queue selection in kernel not taking into account DCB
configuration. This patch fixes the issue by implementing the
ndo_select_queue NDO callback.
