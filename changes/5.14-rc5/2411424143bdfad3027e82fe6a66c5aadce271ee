nvme: remove superfluous bio_set_dev in nvme_requeue_work

Commit ce86dad222e9 ("nvme-multipath: reset bdev to ns head when
failover") moved the reset code where the bio is added to the
requeue_list for the failover path. But it left the original
bio_set_dev in nvme_requeue_work.

There is a second path to nvme_requee_work. It is via
nvme_ns_head_submit_bio. Though we don't have to set bio->bi_bdev for
this path either, as it points to the correct bdev already.

Let's remove the bio_set_dev. It's updating the bio->bi_bdev with the
same pointer and thus it's unnecessary.
