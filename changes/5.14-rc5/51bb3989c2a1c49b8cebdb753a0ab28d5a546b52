media: venus: hfi_cmds.h: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Use flexible-array member in struct hfi_sys_set_property_pkt instead of
one-element array.

Also, this helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds and
fix the following warnings:

drivers/media/platform/qcom/venus/hfi_cmds.c: In function ‘pkt_sys_coverage_config’:
drivers/media/platform/qcom/venus/hfi_cmds.c:57:11: warning: array subscript 1 is above array bounds of ‘u32[1]’ {aka ‘unsigned int[1]’} [-Warray-bounds]
   57 |  pkt->data[1] = mode;
      |  ~~~~~~~~~^~~
