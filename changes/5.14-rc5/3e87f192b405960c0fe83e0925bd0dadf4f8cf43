bpf: Add lookup_and_delete_elem support to hashtab

Extend the existing bpf_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() functionality to
hashtab map types, in addition to stacks and queues.
Create a new hashtab bpf_map_ops function that does lookup and deletion
of the element under the same bucket lock and add the created map_ops to
bpf.h.
