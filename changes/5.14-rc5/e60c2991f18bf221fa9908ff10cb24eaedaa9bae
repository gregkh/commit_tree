serial: fsl_lpuart: remove RTSCTS handling from get_mctrl()

The wrong code in set_mctrl() was already removed in commit 2b30efe2e88a
("tty: serial: lpuart: Remove unnecessary code from set_mctrl"), but the
code in get_mctrl() wasn't removed. It will not return the state of the
RTS or CTS line but whether automatic flow control is enabled, which is
wrong for the get_mctrl(). Thus remove it.
