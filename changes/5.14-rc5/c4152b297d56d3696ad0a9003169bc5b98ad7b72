drm/amd/display: workaround for hard hang on HPD on native DP

[Why]
HPD disable and enable sequences are not mutually exclusive
on Linux. For HPDs that spans over 1s (i.e. HPD low = 1s),
part of the disable sequence (specifically, a request to SMU
to lower refclk) could come right before the call to PHY
enable, causing DMUB to access an unresponsive PHY
and thus a hard hang on the system.

[How]
Disable 48mhz refclk off on native DP.
