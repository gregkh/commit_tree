af_unix: fix garbage collect vs MSG_PEEK

unix_gc() assumes that candidate sockets can never gain an external
reference (i.e.  be installed into an fd) while the unix_gc_lock is
held.  Except for MSG_PEEK this is guaranteed by modifying inflight
count under the unix_gc_lock.

MSG_PEEK does not touch any variable protected by unix_gc_lock (file
count is not), yet it needs to be serialized with garbage collection.
Do this by locking/unlocking unix_gc_lock:

 1) increment file count

 2) lock/unlock barrier to make sure incremented file count is visible
    to garbage collection

 3) install file into fd

This is a lock barrier (unlike smp_mb()) that ensures that garbage
collection is run completely before or completely after the barrier.
