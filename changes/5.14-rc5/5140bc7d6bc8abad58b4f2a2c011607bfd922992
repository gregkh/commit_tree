KVM: VMX: Skip #PF(RSVD) intercepts when emulating smaller maxphyaddr

As part of smaller maxphyaddr emulation, kvm needs to intercept
present page faults to see if it needs to add the RSVD flag (bit 3) to
the error code. However, there is no need to intercept page faults
that already have the RSVD flag set. When setting up the page fault
intercept, add the RSVD flag into the #PF error code mask field (but
not the #PF error code match field) to skip the intercept when the
RSVD flag is already set.
