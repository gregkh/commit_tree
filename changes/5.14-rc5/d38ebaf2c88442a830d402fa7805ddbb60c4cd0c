soundwire: export sdw_update() and sdw_update_no_pm()

We currently export sdw_read() and sdw_write() but the sdw_update()
and sdw_update_no_pm() are currently available only to the bus
code. This was missed in an earlier contribution.

Export both functions so that codec drivers can perform
read-modify-write operations without duplicating the code.

Fixes: b04c975e654c ('soundwire: bus: use sdw_update_no_pm when initializing a device')
