dt-bindings: pinctrl: Update enum for adding SGPM2 and SGPS2

AST2600 has 2 SGPIO master interfaces one with 128 pins and another one
has 80 pins. It also supports 2 SGPIO slave interfaces.
In the current bindings, there are only SGPM1 and SGPS1 defined in enum,
SGPM2 and SGPS2 should also be added in the bindings.
