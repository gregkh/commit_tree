ubifs: Fix races between xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations

UBIFS may occur some problems with concurrent xattr_{set|get} and
listxattr operations, such as assertion failure, memory corruption,
stale xattr value[1].

Fix it by importing a new rw-lock in @ubifs_inode to serilize write
operations on xattr, concurrent read operations are still effective,
just like ext4.
