perf trace: Free syscall tp fields in evsel->priv

ASan reports several memory leaks running:

  # perf test "88: Check open filename arg using perf trace + vfs_getname"

The third of these leaks is related to evsel->priv fields of sycalls
never being deallocated.

This patch adds the function evlist__free_syscall_tp_fields which
iterates over all evsels in evlist, matching syscalls, and calling the
missing frees.

This new function is called at the end of trace__run, right before
calling evlist__delete.
