staging: rtl8712: get rid of flush_scheduled_work

This patch is preparation for following patch for error handling
refactoring.

flush_scheduled_work() takes (wq_completion)events lock and
it can lead to deadlock when r871xu_dev_remove() is called from workqueue.
To avoid deadlock sutiation we can change flush_scheduled_work() call to
flush_work() call for all possibly scheduled works in this driver,
since next patch adds device_release_driver() in case of fw load failure.
