optee: Clear stale cache entries during initialization

The shm cache could contain invalid addresses if
optee_disable_shm_cache() was not called from the .shutdown hook of the
previous kernel before a kexec. These addresses could be unmapped or
they could point to mapped but unintended locations in memory.

Clear the shared memory cache, while being careful to not translate the
addresses returned from OPTEE_SMC_DISABLE_SHM_CACHE, during driver
initialization. Once all pre-cache shm objects are removed, proceed with
enabling the cache so that we know that we can handle cached shm objects
with confidence later in the .shutdown hook.
