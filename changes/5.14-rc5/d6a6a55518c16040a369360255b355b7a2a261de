libbpf: Move BPF_SEQ_PRINTF and BPF_SNPRINTF to bpf_helpers.h

These macros are convenient wrappers around the bpf_seq_printf and
bpf_snprintf helpers. They are currently provided by bpf_tracing.h which
targets low level tracing primitives. bpf_helpers.h is a better fit.

The __bpf_narg and __bpf_apply are needed in both files and provided
twice. __bpf_empty isn't used anywhere and is removed from bpf_tracing.h
