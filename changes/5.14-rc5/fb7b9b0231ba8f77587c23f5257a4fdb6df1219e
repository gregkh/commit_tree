kyber: make trace_block_rq call consistent with documentation

The kyber ioscheduler calls trace_block_rq_insert() *after* the request
is added to the queue but the documentation for trace_block_rq_insert()
says that the call should be made *before* the request is added to the
queue.  Move the tracepoint for the kyber ioscheduler so that it is
consistent with the documentation.
