sctp: do state transition when receiving an icmp TOOBIG packet

PLPMTUD will short-circuit the old process for icmp TOOBIG packets.
This part is described in rfc8899#section-4.6.2 (PL_PTB_SIZE =
PTB_SIZE - other_headers_len). Note that from rfc8899#section-5.2
State Machine, each case below is for some specific states only:

  a) PL_PTB_SIZE < MIN_PLPMTU || PL_PTB_SIZE >= PROBED_SIZE,
     discard it, for any state

  b) MIN_PLPMTU < PL_PTB_SIZE < BASE_PLPMTU,
     Base -> Error, for Base state

  c) BASE_PLPMTU <= PL_PTB_SIZE < PLPMTU,
     Search -> Base or Complete -> Base, for Search and Complete states.

  d) PLPMTU < PL_PTB_SIZE < PROBED_SIZE,
     set pl.probe_size to PL_PTB_SIZE then verify it, for Search state.

The most important one is case d), which will help find the optimal
fast during searching. Like when pathmtu = 1392 for SCTP over IPv4,
the search will be (20 is iphdr_len):

  1. probe with 1200 - 20
  2. probe with 1232 - 20
  3. probe with 1264 - 20
  ...
  7. probe with 1388 - 20
  8. probe with 1420 - 20

When sending the probe with 1420 - 20, TOOBIG may come with PL_PTB_SIZE =
1392 - 20. Then it matches case d), and saves some rounds to try with the
1392 - 20 probe. But of course, PLPMTUD doesn't trust TOOBIG packets, and
it will go back to the common searching once the probe with the new size
can't be verified.
