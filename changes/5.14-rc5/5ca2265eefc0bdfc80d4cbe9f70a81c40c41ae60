- In addition to TX and RX queues, DQO has TX completion and RX buffer
  queues.
  - TX completions are received when the device has completed sending a
    packet on the wire.
  - RX buffers are posted on a separate queue form the RX completions.
- DQO descriptor rings are allowed to be smaller than PAGE_SIZE.
