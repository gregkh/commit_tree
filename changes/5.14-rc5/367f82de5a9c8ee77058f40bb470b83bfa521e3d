iommu/vt-d: Fix kernel-doc syntax in file header

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
The header for drivers/iommu/intel/pasid.c follows this syntax, but
the content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.

This line was probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but is parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warnings from kernel-doc:
warning: Function parameter or member 'fmt' not described in 'pr_fmt'

Provide a simple fix by replacing this occurrence with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
