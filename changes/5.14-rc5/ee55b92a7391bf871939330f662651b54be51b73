dm writecache: flush origin device when writing and cache is full

Commit d53f1fafec9d086f1c5166436abefdaef30e0363 ("dm writecache: do
direct write if the cache is full") changed dm-writecache, so that it
writes directly to the origin device if the cache is full.
Unfortunately, it doesn't forward flush requests to the origin device,
so that there is a bug where flushes are being ignored.

Fix this by adding missing flush forwarding.

For PMEM mode, we fix this bug by disabling direct writes to the origin
device, because it performs better.
