mm/vmscan: remove kerneldoc-like comment from isolate_lru_pages

Patch series "Clean W=1 build warnings for mm/".

This is a janitorial only.  During development of a tool to catch build
warnings early to avoid tripping the Intel lkp-robot, I noticed that mm/
is not clean for W=1.  This is generally harmless but there is no harm in
cleaning it up.  It disrupts git blame a little but on relatively obvious
lines that are unlikely to be git blame targets.

This patch (of 13):

make W=1 generates the following warning for vmscan.c

    mm/vmscan.c:1814: warning: This comment starts with '/**', but isn't a kernel-doc comment. Refer Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst

It is not a kerneldoc comment and isolate_lru_pages() is a static
function.  While the detailed comment is nice, it does not need to be
exposed via kernel-doc.
