ALSA: firewire-digi00x: perform sequence replay for media clock recovery

This commit takes ALSA firewire-digi00x driver to perform sequence replay
for media clock recovery.

All of models in Digidesign digi00x family don't transfer isochronous
packets till receiving isochronous packets. The on-the-fly mode is used
for the purpose. They don't interpret presentation time expressed in syt
field of received CIP, therefore the sequence of the number of data blocks
per packet is important for media clock recovery.

The sequence replay is tested with below models:

* Digidesign Digi 002
* Digidesign Digi 002 Rack
* Digidesign Digi 003
* Digidesign Digi 003 Rack
