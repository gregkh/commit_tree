remoteproc: core: Move cdev add before device add

When cdev_add is called after device_add has been called there is no
way for the userspace to know about the addition of a cdev as cdev_add
itself doesn't trigger a uevent notification, or for the kernel to
know about the change to devt. This results in two problems:
 - mknod is never called for the cdev and hence no cdev appears on
   devtmpfs.
 - sysfs links to the new cdev are not established.

The cdev needs to be added and devt assigned before device_add() is
called in order for the relevant sysfs and devtmpfs entries to be
created and the uevent to be properly populated.
