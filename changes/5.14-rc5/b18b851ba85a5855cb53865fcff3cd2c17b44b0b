scripts/recordmcount.pl: Remove check_objcopy() and $can_use_local

When building ARCH=riscv allmodconfig with llvm-objcopy, the objcopy
version warning from this script appears:

WARNING: could not find objcopy version or version is less than 2.17.
        Local function references are disabled.

The check_objcopy() function in scripts/recordmcount.pl is set up to
parse GNU objcopy's version string, not llvm-objcopy's, which triggers
the warning.

Commit 799c43415442 ("kbuild: thin archives make default for all archs")
made binutils 2.20 mandatory and commit ba64beb17493 ("kbuild: check the
minimum assembler version in Kconfig") enforces this at configuration
time so just remove check_objcopy() and $can_use_local instead, assuming
--globalize-symbol is always available.

llvm-objcopy has supported --globalize-symbol since LLVM 7.0.0 in 2018
and the minimum version for building the kernel with LLVM is 10.0.1 so
there is no issue introduced:
