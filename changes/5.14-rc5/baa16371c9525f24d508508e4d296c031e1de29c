dmaengine: stm32-dmamux: Fix PM usage counter unbalance in stm32 dmamux ops

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter
even it failed. Forgetting to putting operation will
result in reference leak here. We fix it by replacing
it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter
balanced.
