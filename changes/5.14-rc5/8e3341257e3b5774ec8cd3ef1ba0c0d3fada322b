Revert "thunderbolt: Hide authorized attribute if router does not support PCIe tunnels"

This reverts commit 6f3badead6a078cf3c71f381f9d84ac922984a00.

It turns out bolt depends on having authorized attribute visible under
each device. Hiding it makes bolt crash as several people have reported
on various bug trackers. For this reason revert the commit.
