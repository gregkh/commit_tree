squashfs: add option to panic on errors

Add an errors=panic mount option to make squashfs trigger a panic when
errors are encountered, similar to several other filesystems.  This allows
a kernel dump to be saved using which the corruption can be analysed and
debugged.

Inspired by a pre-fs_context patch by Anton Eliasson.
