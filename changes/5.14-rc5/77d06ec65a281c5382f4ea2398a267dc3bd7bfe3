x86/platform/uv: Constify static attribute_group struct

The only use of base_attr_group and hubless_base_attr_group is to pass
their addresses to sysfs_create_group() and sysfs_remove_group(), both
which takes pointers to const attribute_group structs. Make them const
to allow the compiler to put them in read-only memory.
