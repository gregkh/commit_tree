drm/rockchip: dsi: remove extra component_del() call

commit cf6d100dd238 ("drm/rockchip: dsi: add dual mipi support") added
this devcnt field and call to component_del(). However, these both
appear to be erroneous changes left over from an earlier version of the
patch. In the version merged, nothing ever modifies devcnt, meaning
component_del() runs unconditionally and in addition to the
component_del() calls in dw_mipi_dsi_rockchip_host_detach(). The second
call fails to delete anything and produces a warning in dmesg.

If we look at the previous version of the patch[1], however, we see that
it had logic to calculate devcnt and call component_add() in certain
situations. This was removed in v6, and the fact that the deletion code
was not appears to have been an oversight.
