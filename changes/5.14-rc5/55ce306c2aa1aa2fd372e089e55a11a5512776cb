drm/i915/adl_p: Implement TC sequences

ADL-P have basically the same TC connection and disconnection
sequences as ICL and TGL, the major difference is the new registers.

So here adding functions without the icl prefix in the name and
making the new functions call the platform specific function to access
the correct register.

v2:
 - Retain DDI TC PHY ownership flag during modesetting.
