net/mlx5: Added new parameters to reformat context

Adding new reformat context type (INSERT_HEADER) requires adding two new
parameters to reformat context - reformat_param_0 and reformat_param_1.
As defined by HW spec, these parameters have different meaning for
different reformat context type.

The first parameter (reformat_param_0) is not new to HW spec, but it
wasn't used by any of the supported reformats. The second parameter
(reformat_param_1) is new to the HW spec - it was added to allow
supporting INSERT_HEADER.

For NSERT_HEADER, reformat_param_0 indicates the header used to
reference the location of the inserted header, and reformat_param_1
indicates the offset of the inserted header from the reference point
defined by reformat_param_0.
