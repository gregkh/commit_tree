s390/cpcmd: use register pair instead of register asm

Remove register asm usage from diag8_noresponse() since it wasn't
needed at all. There is no requirement for even/odd register pairs for
diag 0x8.

For diag_response() use register pairs to fulfill the rx+1 and ry+1
requirements as required if a response buffer is specified. Also
change the inline asm to return the condition code of the diagnose
instruction and do the conditional handling of response length
calculation in C.
