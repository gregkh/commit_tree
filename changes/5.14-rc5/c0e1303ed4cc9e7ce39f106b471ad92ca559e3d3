KVM: VMX: Remove vmx_msr_index from vmx.h

vmx_msr_index was used to record the list of MSRs which can be lazily
restored when kvm returns to userspace. It is now reimplemented as
kvm_uret_msrs_list, a common x86 list which is only used inside x86.c.
So just remove the obsolete declaration in vmx.h.
