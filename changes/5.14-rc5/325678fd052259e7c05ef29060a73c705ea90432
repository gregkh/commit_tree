powerpc/64s: add a table of implicit soft-masked addresses

Commit 9d1988ca87dd ("powerpc/64: treat low kernel text as irqs
soft-masked") ends up catching too much code, including ret_from_fork,
and parts of interrupt and syscall return that do not expect to be
interrupts to be soft-masked. If an interrupt gets marked pending,
and then the code proceeds out of the implicit soft-masked region it
will fail to deal with the pending interrupt.

Fix this by adding a new table of addresses which explicitly marks
the regions of code that are soft masked. This table is only checked
for interrupts that below __end_soft_masked, so most kernel interrupts
will not have the overhead of the table search.
