usb: cdns3: Fixed incorrect gadget state

For delayed status phase, the usb_gadget->state was set
to USB_STATE_ADDRESS and it has never been updated to
USB_STATE_CONFIGURED.
Patch updates the gadget state to correct USB_STATE_CONFIGURED.
As a result of this bug the controller was not able to enter to
Test Mode while using MSC function.
