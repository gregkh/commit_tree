bnxt_en: Move bnxt_ptp_init() to bnxt_open()

The device needs to be in ifup state for PTP to function, so move
bnxt_ptp_init() to bnxt_open().  This means that the PHC will be
registered during bnxt_open().

This also makes firmware reset work correctly.  PTP configurations
may change after firmware upgrade or downgrade.  bnxt_open() will
be called after firmware reset, so it will work properly.

bnxt_ptp_start() is now incorporated into bnxt_ptp_init().  We now
also need to call bnxt_ptp_clear() in bnxt_close().
