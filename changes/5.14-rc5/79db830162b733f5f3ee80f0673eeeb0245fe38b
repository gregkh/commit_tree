scsi: megaraid_sas: Send all non-RW I/Os for TYPE_ENCLOSURE device through firmware

The driver issues all non-ReadWrite I/Os for TYPE_ENCLOSURE devices through
the fast path with invalid dev handle. Fast path in turn directs all the
I/Os to the firmware. As firmware stopped handling those I/Os from SAS3.5
generation of controllers (Ventura generation and onwards) this will lead
to I/O failures.

Switch the driver to issue all the non-ReadWrite I/Os for TYPE_ENCLOSURE
devices directly to firmware for SAS3.5 generation of controllers and
later.
