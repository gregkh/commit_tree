PCI: iproc: Fix multi-MSI base vector number allocation

Commit fc54bae28818 ("PCI: iproc: Allow allocation of multiple MSIs")
introduced multi-MSI support with a broken allocation mechanism (it failed
to reserve the proper number of bits from the inner domain).  Natural
alignment of the base vector number was also not guaranteed.
