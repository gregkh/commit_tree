arm64: dts: qcom: trogdor: Add no-hpd to DSI bridge node

We should indicate that we're not using the HPD pin on this device, per
the binding document. Otherwise if code in the future wants to enable
HPD in the bridge when this property is absent we'll be wasting power
powering hpd when we don't use it on trogdor boards. We didn't notice
this before because the kernel driver blindly disables hpd, but that
won't be true for much longer.
