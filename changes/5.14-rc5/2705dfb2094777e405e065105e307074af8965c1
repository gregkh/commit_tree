block: fix discard request merge

ll_new_hw_segment() is reached only in case of single range discard
merge, and we don't have max discard segment size limit actually, so
it is wrong to run the following check:

if (req->nr_phys_segments + nr_phys_segs > blk_rq_get_max_segments(req))

it may be always false since req->nr_phys_segments is initialized as
one, and bio's segment count is still 1, blk_rq_get_max_segments(reg)
is 1 too.

Fix the issue by not doing the check and bypassing the calculation of
discard request's nr_phys_segments.
