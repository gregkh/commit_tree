arm64: assembler: add conditional cache fixups

It would be helpful if we could use both `dcache_by_line_op` and
`invalidate_icache_by_line` for user memory without accidentally fixing
up unexpected faults when performing maintenance on kernel addresses.

Let's make this possible by having both macros take an optional fixup
label, and only generating an extable entry if a label is provided.

At the same time, let's clean up the labels used to be globally unique
using \@ as we do for other macros.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
