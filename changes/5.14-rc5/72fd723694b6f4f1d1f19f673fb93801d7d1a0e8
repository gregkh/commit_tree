arm64: Move instruction encoder/decoder under lib/

Aarch64 instruction set encoding and decoding logic can prove useful
for some features/tools both part of the kernel and outside the kernel.

Isolate the function dealing only with encoding/decoding instructions,
with minimal dependency on kernel utilities in order to be able to reuse
that code.

Code was only moved, no code should have been added, removed nor
modifier.
