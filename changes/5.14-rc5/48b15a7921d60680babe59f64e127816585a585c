irqdomain: Cache irq_data instead of a virq number in the revmap

Caching a virq number in the revmap is pretty inefficient, as
it means we will need to convert it back to either an irq_data
or irq_desc to do anything with it.

It is also a bit odd, as the radix tree does cache irq_data
pointers.

Change the revmap type to be an irq_data pointer instead of
an unsigned int, and preserve the current API for now.
