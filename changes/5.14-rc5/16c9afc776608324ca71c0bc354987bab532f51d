arm64/mm: drop HAVE_ARCH_PFN_VALID

CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP is now the only available memory model on arm64
platforms and free_unused_memmap() would just return without creating any
holes in the memmap mapping.  There is no need for any special handling in
pfn_valid() and HAVE_ARCH_PFN_VALID can just be dropped.  This also moves
the pfn upper bits sanity check into generic pfn_valid().
