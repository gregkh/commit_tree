kbuild: sink stdout from cmd for silent build

When building with 'make -s', no output to stdout should be printed.

As Arnd Bergmann reported [1], mkimage shows the detailed information
of the generated images.

I think this should be suppressed by the 'cmd' macro instead of by
individual scripts.

Insert 'exec >/dev/null;' in order to redirect stdout to /dev/null for
silent builds.

[Note about this implementation]

'exec >/dev/null;' may look somewhat tricky, but this has a reason.

Appending '>/dev/null' at the end of command line is a common way for
redirection, so I first tried this:

  cmd = @set -e; $(echo-cmd) $(cmd_$(1)) >/dev/null

... but it would not work if $(cmd_$(1)) itself contains a redirection.

For example, cmd_wrap in scripts/Makefile.asm-generic redirects the
output from the 'echo' command into the target file.

It would be expanded into:

  echo "#include <asm-generic/$*.h>" > $@ >/dev/null

Then, the target file gets empty because the string will go to /dev/null
instead of $@.

Next, I tried this:

  cmd = @set -e; $(echo-cmd) { $(cmd_$(1)); } >/dev/null

The form above would be expanded into:

  { echo "#include <asm-generic/$*.h>" > $@; } >/dev/null

This works as expected. However, it would be a syntax error if
$(cmd_$(1)) is empty.

When CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS is disabled, $(call cmd,gen_ksymdeps) in
scripts/Makefile.build would be expanded into:

  set -e;  { ; } >/dev/null

..., which causes an syntax error.

I also tried this:

  cmd = @set -e; $(echo-cmd) ( $(cmd_$(1)) ) >/dev/null

... but this causes a syntax error for the same reason.

So, finally I adopted:

  cmd = @set -e; $(echo-cmd) exec >/dev/null; $(cmd_$(1))
