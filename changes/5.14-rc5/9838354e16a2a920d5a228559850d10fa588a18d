mm: memcontrol: simplify the logic of objcg pinning memcg

The obj_cgroup_release() and memcg_reparent_objcgs() are serialized by the
css_set_lock.  We do not need to care about objcg->memcg being released in
the process of obj_cgroup_release().  So there is no need to pin memcg
before releasing objcg.  Remove those pinning logic to simplfy the code.

There are only two places that modifies the objcg->memcg.  One is the
initialization to objcg->memcg in the memcg_online_kmem(), another is
objcgs reparenting in the memcg_reparent_objcgs().  It is also impossible
for the two to run in parallel.  So xchg() is unnecessary and it is enough
to use WRITE_ONCE().
