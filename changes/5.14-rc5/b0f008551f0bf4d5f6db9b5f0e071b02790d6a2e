perf sched: Fix record failure when CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS is not set

The tracepoints trace_sched_stat_{wait, sleep, iowait} are not exposed to user
if CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS is not set, "perf sched record" records the three events.
As a result, the command fails.

Before:

  #perf sched record sleep 1
  event syntax error: 'sched:sched_stat_wait'
                       \___ unknown tracepoint

  Error:  File /sys/kernel/tracing/events/sched/sched_stat_wait not found.
  Hint:   Perhaps this kernel misses some CONFIG_ setting to enable this feature?.

  Run 'perf list' for a list of valid events

   Usage: perf record [<options>] [<command>]
      or: perf record [<options>] -- <command> [<options>]

      -e, --event <event>   event selector. use 'perf list' to list available events

Solution:
  Check whether schedstat tracepoints are exposed. If no, these events are not recorded.

After:
  # perf sched record sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.163 MB perf.data (1091 samples) ]
  # perf sched report
  run measurement overhead: 4736 nsecs
  sleep measurement overhead: 9059979 nsecs
  the run test took 999854 nsecs
  the sleep test took 8945271 nsecs
  nr_run_events:        716
  nr_sleep_events:      785
  nr_wakeup_events:     0
  ...
