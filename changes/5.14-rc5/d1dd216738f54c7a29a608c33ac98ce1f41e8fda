dt-bindings: timer: renesas,tpu: Convert to json-schema

Convert the Renesas H8/300 Timer Pulse Unit Device Tree binding
documentation to json-schema.

Correct clock-names, as "peripheral_clk" is the name of the supplier,
and all users use "fck".

Note that there are two different bindings for the TPU, both using
"renesas,tpu": this one for using the TPU as a clock source (used on
H8/300), and a second use for using the TPU as a PWM controller (used on
ARM).  To avoid conflicts, both bindings are marked with the appropriate
"select" logic, to check for the absence respectively presence of the
"#pwm-cells" property.
