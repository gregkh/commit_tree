objtool: Improve reloc hash size guestimate

Nathan reported that LLVM ThinLTO builds have a performance regression
with commit 25cf0d8aa2a3 ("objtool: Rewrite hashtable sizing"). Sami
was quick to note that this is due to their use of -ffunction-sections.

As a result the .text section is small and basing the number of relocs
off of that no longer works. Instead have read_sections() compute the
sum of all SHF_EXECINSTR sections and use that.
