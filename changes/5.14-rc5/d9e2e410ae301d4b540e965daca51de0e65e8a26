sctp: add the constants/variables and states and some APIs for transport

These are 4 constants described in rfc8899#section-5.1.2:

  MAX_PROBES, MIN_PLPMTU, MAX_PLPMTU, BASE_PLPMTU;

And 2 variables described in rfc8899#section-5.1.3:

  PROBED_SIZE, PROBE_COUNT;

And 5 states described in rfc8899#section-5.2:

  DISABLED, BASE, SEARCH, SEARCH_COMPLETE, ERROR;

And these 4 APIs are used to reset/update PLPMTUD, check if PLPMTUD is
enabled, and calculate the additional headers length for a transport.

Note the member 'probe_high' in transport will be set to the probe
size when a probe fails with this probe size in the next patches.
