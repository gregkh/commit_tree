drm/amdgpu: extend xnack limit page fault timeout

Extending this timeout will prevent IH from storm interrupts coming
from SDMA while a page fault is active. Currently, on Aldebaran,
handling that many interrupts can take a lot of CPU time
(up to 4 seconds).
This eventually causes timeouts in other tasks.
