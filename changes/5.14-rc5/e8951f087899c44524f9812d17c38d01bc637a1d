iio: imu: inv_mpu6050: Drop use of %hhx format string.

Since:
commit cbacb5ab0aa0 ("docs: printk-formats: Stop encouraging use of
unnecessary %h[xudi] and %hh[xudi]")
use of these format strings has been discouraged.

Use the 0x02x form as the length specifier when used with # includes
the 0x prefix and is very unlikely to be what was intended by the author.

Part of a series removing all uses from IIO in the interestings of
avoiding providing bad examples for people to copy.
