n_tty: drop n_tty_receive_buf_fast

After the previous patches, n_tty_receive_buf_standard and
n_tty_receive_buf_fast differ only in handling of tty line and input
controls. Unlike n_tty_receive_buf_fast, n_tty_receive_buf_standard
handles them all (I_ISTRIP, I_IUCLC, L_IEXTEN, L_EXTPROC, and I_PARMRK).

So remove n_tty_receive_buf_fast and let n_tty_receive_buf_standard do
the handling. Actually most of the tests are only moved from
__receive_buf to n_tty_receive_buf_standard.

Again, the code duplication is not worth the theoretical speedup.
