io_uring: shove more drain bits out of hot path

Place all drain_next logic into io_drain_req(), so it's never executed
if there was no drained requests before. The only thing we need is to
set ->drain_active if we see a request with IOSQE_IO_DRAIN, do that in
io_init_req() where flags are definitely in registers.

Also, all drain-related code is encapsulated in io_drain_req(), makes it
cleaner.
