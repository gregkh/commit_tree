dt-bindings: clock: add IDs for SCMI clocks on stm32mp15

stm32mp15 TZ secure firmware provides SCMI clocks for oscillators, some
PLL output and few secure aware interfaces.
This change defines the SCMI clock identifiers used by SCMI agents
and servers.
Server SCMI0 exposes clocks and reset controllers for resources under
RCC[TZEN] configuration control.
Server SCMI1 exposes clocks for resources under RCC[MCKPROT] control.
