iommu/vt-d: Tweak the description of a DMA fault

The Intel IOMMU driver reports the DMA fault reason in a decimal number
while the VT-d specification uses a hexadecimal one. It's inconvenient
that users need to covert them everytime before consulting the spec.
Let's use hexadecimal number for a DMA fault reason.

The fault message uses 0xffffffff as PASID for DMA requests w/o PASID.
This is confusing. Tweak this by adding "NO_PASID" explicitly.
