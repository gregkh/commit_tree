usb: host: ohci-at91: suspend/resume ports after/before OHCI accesses

On SAMA7G5 suspending ports will cut the access to OHCI registers and
any subsequent access to them will lead to CPU being blocked trying to
access that memory. Same thing happens on resume: if OHCI memory is
accessed before resuming ports the CPU will block on that access. The
OCHI memory is accessed on suspend/resume though
ohci_suspend()/ohci_resume().
