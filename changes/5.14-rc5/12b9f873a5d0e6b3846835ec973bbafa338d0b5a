mm/vmalloc: fallback to a single page allocator

Currently for order-0 pages we use a bulk-page allocator to get set of
pages.  From the other hand not allocating all pages is something that
might occur.  In that case we should fallbak to the single-page allocator
trying to get missing pages, because it is more permissive(direct reclaim,
etc).

Introduce a vm_area_alloc_pages() function where the described logic is
implemented.
