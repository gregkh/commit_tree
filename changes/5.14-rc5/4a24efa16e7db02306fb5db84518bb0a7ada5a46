sata_highbank: fix deferred probing

The driver overrides the error codes returned by platform_get_irq() to
-EINVAL, so if it returns -EPROBE_DEFER, the driver would fail the probe
permanently instead of the deferred probing. Switch to propagating the
error code upstream, still checking/overriding IRQ0 as libata regards it
as "no IRQ" (thus polling) anyway...
