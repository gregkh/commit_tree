RDMA/rtrs: Check device max_qp_wr limit when create QP

Currently we only check device max_qp_wr limit for IO connection, but not
for service connection. We should check for both.

So save the max_qp_wr device limit in wr_limit, and use it for both IO
connections and service connections.

While at it, also remove an outdated comments.
