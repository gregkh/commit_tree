drm/amdkfd: invalidate tables on page retry fault

GPU page tables are invalidated by unmapping prange directly at
the mmu notifier, when page fault retry is enabled through
amdgpu_noretry global parameter. The restore page table is
performed at the page fault handler.

If xnack is on, we update GPU mappings after migration to avoid
unnecessary GPUVM faults.
