x86/syscall: Unconditionally prototype {ia32,x32}_sys_call_table[]

Even if these APIs are disabled, and the arrays therefore do not
exist, having the prototypes allows us to use IS_ENABLED() rather than
using #ifdefs.

If something ends up trying to actually *use* these arrays a linker
error will ensue.
