net/sched: taprio: Fix init procedure

Commit 13511704f8d759 ("net: taprio offload: enforce qdisc to netdev queue mapping")
resulted in duplicate entries in the qdisc hash.
While this did not impact the overall operation of the qdisc and taprio
code paths, it did result in an infinite loop when dumping the qdisc
properties, at least on one target (NXP LS1028 ARDB).
Removing the duplicate call to qdisc_hash_add() solves the problem.
