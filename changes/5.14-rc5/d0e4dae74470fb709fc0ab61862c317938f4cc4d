riscv: Fix 32-bit RISC-V boot failure

Commit dd2d082b5760 ("riscv: Cleanup setup_bootmem()") adjusted
the calling sequence in setup_bootmem(), which invalidates the fix
commit de043da0b9e7 ("RISC-V: Fix usage of memblock_enforce_memory_limit")
did for 32-bit RISC-V unfortunately.

So now 32-bit RISC-V does not boot again when testing booting kernel
on QEMU 'virt' with '-m 2G', which was exactly what the original
commit de043da0b9e7 ("RISC-V: Fix usage of memblock_enforce_memory_limit")
tried to fix.
