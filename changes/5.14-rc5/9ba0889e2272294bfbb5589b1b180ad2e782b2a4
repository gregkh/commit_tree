xfs: drop the AGI being passed to xfs_check_agi_freecount

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Stephen Rothwell reported this compiler warning from linux-next:

fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_ialloc.c: In function 'xfs_difree_finobt':
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_ialloc.c:2032:20: warning: unused variable 'agi' [-Wunused-variable]
 2032 |  struct xfs_agi   *agi = agbp->b_addr;

Which is fallout from agno -> perag conversions that were done in
this function. xfs_check_agi_freecount() is the only user of "agi"
in xfs_difree_finobt() now, and it only uses the agi to get the
current free inode count. We hold that in the perag structure, so
there's not need to directly reference the raw AGI to get this
information.

The btree cursor being passed to xfs_check_agi_freecount() has a
reference to the perag being operated on, so use that directly in
xfs_check_agi_freecount() rather than passing an AGI.

Fixes: 7b13c5155182 ("xfs: use perag for ialloc btree cursors")
