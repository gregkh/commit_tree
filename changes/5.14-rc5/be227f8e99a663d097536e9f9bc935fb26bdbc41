iommu/amd: Tidy up DMA ops init

Now that DMA ops are part of the core API via iommu-dma, fold the
vestigial remains of the IOMMU_DMA_OPS init state into the IOMMU API
phase, and clean up a few other leftovers. This should also close the
race window wherein bus_set_iommu() effectively makes the DMA ops state
visible before its nominal initialisation - it seems this was previously
fairly benign, but since commit a250c23f15c2 ("iommu: remove
DOMAIN_ATTR_DMA_USE_FLUSH_QUEUE") it can now lead to the strict flush
queue policy inadvertently being picked for default domains allocated
during that window, with a corresponding unexpected perfomance impact.
