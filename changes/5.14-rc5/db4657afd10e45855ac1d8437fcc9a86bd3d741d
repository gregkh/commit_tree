RDMA/cma: Revert INIT-INIT patch

The net/sunrpc/xprtrdma module creates its QP using rdma_create_qp() and
immediately post receives, implicitly assuming the QP is in the INIT state
and thus valid for ib_post_recv().

The patch noted in Fixes: removed the RESET->INIT modifiy from
rdma_create_qp(), breaking NFS rdma for verbs providers that fail the
ib_post_recv() for a bad state.

This situation was proven using kprobes in rvt_post_recv() and
rvt_modify_qp(). The traces showed that the rvt_post_recv() failed before
ANY modify QP and that the current state was RESET.

Fix by reverting the patch below.
