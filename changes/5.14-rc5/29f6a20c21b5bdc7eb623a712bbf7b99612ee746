arm64: dts: ls1028: sl28: fix networking for variant 2

The PHY configuration for the variant 2 is still missing the flag for
in-band signalling between PHY and MAC. Both sides - MAC and PHY - have
to match the setting. For now, Linux only supports setting the MAC side
and thus it has to match the setting the bootloader is configuring.
Enable in-band signalling to make ethernet work.
