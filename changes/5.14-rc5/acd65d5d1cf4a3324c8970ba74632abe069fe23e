thermal/drivers/int340x/processor_thermal: Add PCI MMIO based thermal driver

Add a new PCI driver which register a thermal zone and allows to get
notification for threshold violation by a RW trip point. These
notifications are delivered from the device using MSI based
interrupt.

The main difference between this new PCI driver and the existing
one is that the temperature and trip points directly use PCI
MMIO instead of using ACPI methods.

This driver registers a thermal zone "TCPU_PCI" in addition to the
legacy processor thermal device, which uses ACPI companion device
to set name, temperature and trips.

This driver is enabled for AlderLake.
