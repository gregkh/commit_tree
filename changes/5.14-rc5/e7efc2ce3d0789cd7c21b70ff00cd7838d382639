liquidio: Fix unintentional sign extension issue on left shift of u16

Shifting the u16 integer oct->pcie_port by CN23XX_PKT_INPUT_CTL_MAC_NUM_POS
(29) bits will be promoted to a 32 bit signed int and then sign-extended
to a u64. In the cases where oct->pcie_port where bit 2 is set (e.g. 3..7)
the shifted value will be sign extended and the top 32 bits of the result
will be set.

Fix this by casting the u16 values to a u64 before the 29 bit left shift.
