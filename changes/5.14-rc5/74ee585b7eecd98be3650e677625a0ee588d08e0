kbuild: remove trailing slashes from $(KBUILD_EXTMOD)

M= (or KBUILD_EXTMOD) generally expects a directory path without any
trailing slashes, like M=a/b/c.

If you add a trailing slash, like M=a/b/c/, you will get ugly build
logs (two slashes in a series), but it still works fine as long as it
is consistent between 'make modules' and 'make modules_install'.

The following commands correctly build and install the modules.

  $ make M=a/b/c/ modules
  $ sudo make M=a/b/c/ modules_install

Since commit ccae4cfa7bfb ("kbuild: refactor scripts/Makefile.modinst"),
a problem happens if you add a trailing slash only for modules_install.

  $ make M=a/b/c modules
  $ sudo make M=a/b/c/ modules_install

No module is installed in this case, Johannes Berg reported. [1]

Trim any trailing slashes from $(KBUILD_EXTMOD).

I used the 'dirname' command to remove all the trailing slashes in
case someone adds more slashes like M=a/b/c/////. The Make's built-in
function, $(dir ...) cannot take care of such a case.
