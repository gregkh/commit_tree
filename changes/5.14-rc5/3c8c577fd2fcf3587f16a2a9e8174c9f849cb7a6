staging: rtl8723bs: refactor to reduce indents

Reduce the number of indents in rtw_wlan_util.c file by refactoring the
code.

Moved the part of code that rearranged ac paramaters in the function
WMMOnAssocResp to a separate function named sort_wmm_ac_params. It takes
both the array of ac params and their indexes as arguments and sorts them.
Has return type void.

Moved the part of code that checked IE for realtek vendor in the
function check_assoc_AP to a separate function named
get_realtek_assoc_AP_vender. It takes a struct ndis_80211_var_ie * as an
argument and returns u32 realtek vendor.
