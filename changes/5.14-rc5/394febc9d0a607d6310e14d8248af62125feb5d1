misc/pvpanic: Make 'pvpanic_probe()' resource managed

Simplify code and turn 'pvpanic_probe()' into a managed resource version.
This simplify callers that don't need to do some clean-up on error in the
probe and on remove.

Update pvpanic-mmio.c and pvpanic-pci.c accordingly.

'pvpanic_remove()' don't need to be exported anymore.
