KVM: x86/mmu: Ignore CR0 and CR4 bits in nested EPT MMU role

Do not incorporate CR0/CR4 bits into the role for the nested EPT MMU, as
EPT behavior is not influenced by CR0/CR4.  Note, this is the guest_mmu,
(L1's EPT), not nested_mmu (L2's IA32 paging); the nested_mmu does need
CR0/CR4, and is initialized in a separate flow.
