arm64: dts: ls1028a: fix node name for the sysclk

U-Boot attempts to fix up the "clock-frequency" property of the "/sysclk" node:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/u-boot/v2021.04/source/arch/arm/cpu/armv8/fsl-layerscape/fdt.c#L512

but fails to do so:

All Layerscape SoCs except LS1028A use "sysclk" as the node name, and
not "clock-sysclk". So change the node name of LS1028A accordingly.
