RDMA/rxe: Restore setting tot_len in the IPv4 header

An earlier patch removed setting of tot_len in IPv4 headers because it was
also set in ip_local_out. However, this change resulted in an incorrect
ICRC being computed because the tot_len field is not masked out. This
patch restores that line. This fixes the bug reported by Zhu Yanjun.  This
bug affects anyone using rxe which is currently broken.
