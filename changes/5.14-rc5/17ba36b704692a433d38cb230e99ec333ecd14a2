ASoC: dt-bindings: codecs: Add bindings for nxp, tfa989x

NXP/Goodix TFA989X (TFA1) amplifiers are controlled via an I2C bus.
Add simple device tree bindings that describe how to set them up
in the device tree.

Right now only nxp,tfa9895 is supported but this will be extended
to at least nxp,tfa9897 in the near future.
