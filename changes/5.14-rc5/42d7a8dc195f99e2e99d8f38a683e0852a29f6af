PCI: mobiveil: Remove unused readl and writel functions

The PCIe host controller driver for Layerscape 4th generation SoC was
added in the commit d29ad70a813b ("PCI: mobiveil: Add PCIe Gen4 RC
driver for Layerscape SoCs").

At this time two static functions were introduced that appear to
currently have no users.  Since nothing is using neither of these
functions at the moment they can be safely removed.

This resolves the following build time warnings:

  drivers/pci/controller/mobiveil/pcie-layerscape-gen4.c:45:19: warning: unused function 'ls_pcie_g4_lut_readl' [-Wunused-function]
  drivers/pci/controller/mobiveil/pcie-layerscape-gen4.c:50:20: warning: unused function 'ls_pcie_g4_lut_writel' [-Wunused-function]
