Input: goodix - platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi - Move upside down quirks to touchscreen_dmi.c

Move the DMI quirks for upside-down mounted Goodix touchscreens from
drivers/input/touchscreen/goodix.c to
drivers/platform/x86/touchscreen_dmi.c,
where all the other x86 touchscreen quirks live.

Note the touchscreen_dmi.c code attaches standard touchscreen
device-properties to an i2c-client device based on a combination of a
DMI match + a device-name match. I've verified that the: Teclast X98 Pro,
WinBook TW100 and WinBook TW700 uses an ACPI devicename of "GDIX1001:00"
based on acpidumps and/or dmesg output available on the web.

This patch was tested on a Teclast X89 tablet.
