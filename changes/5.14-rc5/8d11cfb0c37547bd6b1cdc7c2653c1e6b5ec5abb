dmaengine: imx-sdma: Remove platform data header

Since commit 6c5f05a6cd88 ("ARM: imx3: Remove imx3 soc_init()")
there are no more users of struct sdma_script_start_addrs outside
of the driver itself, thus let's move the struct declaration just
to the driver source code and remove the header file as unused one.
