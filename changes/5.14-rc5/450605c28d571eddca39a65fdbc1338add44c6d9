x86/hyperv: fix logical processor creation

Microsoft Hypervisor expects the logical processor index to be the same
as CPU's index during logical processor creation. Using cpu_physical_id
confuses hypervisor's scheduler. That causes the root partition not boot
when core scheduler is used.

This patch removes the call to cpu_physical_id and uses the CPU index
directly for bringing up logical processor. This scheme works for both
classic scheduler and core scheduler.
