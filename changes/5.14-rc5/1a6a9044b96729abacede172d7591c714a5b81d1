x86/setup: Remove CONFIG_X86_RESERVE_LOW and reservelow= options

The CONFIG_X86_RESERVE_LOW build time and reservelow= command line option
allowed to control the amount of memory under 1M that would be reserved at
boot to avoid using memory that can be potentially clobbered by BIOS.

Since the entire range under 1M is always reserved there is no need for
these options anymore and they can be removed.
