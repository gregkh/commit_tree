drm/i915/xelpd: Define plane capabilities

XE_LPD's plane support is identical to RKL and ADL-S --- 5 universal + 1
cursor with NV12 UV support on planes 1-3 and NV12 Y support on planes
4-5.

v2:
 - Drop the extra 90/270 rotation check in skl_plane_check_fb(); the DRM
   property code will already prevent userspace from passing us values
   that weren't advertised.  (Lucas)
