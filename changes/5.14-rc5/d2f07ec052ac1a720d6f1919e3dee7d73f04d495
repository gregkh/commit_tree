mm: make __dump_page static

Patch series "Constify struct page arguments".

While working on various solutions to the 32-bit struct page size
regression, one of the problems I found was the networking stack expects
to be able to pass const struct page pointers around, and the mm doesn't
provide a lot of const-friendly functions to call.  The root tangle of
problems is that a lot of functions call VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(), which calls
dump_page(), which calls a lot of functions which don't take a const
struct page (but could be const).

This patch (of 6):

The only caller of __dump_page() now opencodes dump_page(), so remove it
as an externally visible symbol.
