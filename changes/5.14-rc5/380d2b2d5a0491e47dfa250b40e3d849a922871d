regulator: core: Add regulator_sync_voltage_rdev()

Some NVIDIA Tegra devices use a CPU soft-reset method for the reboot and
in this case we need to restore the coupled voltages to the state that is
suitable for hardware during boot. Add new regulator_sync_voltage_rdev()
helper which is needed by regulator drivers in order to sync voltage of
a coupled regulators.
