PCI: Add sysfs "removable" attribute

A PCI device is "external_facing" if it's a Root Port with the ACPI
"ExternalFacingPort" property or if it has the DT "external-facing"
property.  We consider everything downstream from such a device to
be removable by user.

We're mainly concerned with consumer platforms with user accessible
Thunderbolt ports that are vulnerable to DMA attacks, and we expect those
ports to be identified by firmware as "ExternalFacingPort". Devices in
traditional hotplug slots can technically be removed, but the expectation
is that unless the port is marked with "ExternalFacingPort", such devices
are less accessible to user / may not be removed by end user, and thus not
exposed as "removable" to userspace.

This can be used to implement userspace policies tailored for
user removable devices. Eg usage:
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform2/+/2591812
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform2/+/2795038
(code uses such an attribute to remove external PCI devices or disable
features on them as needed by the policy desired)
