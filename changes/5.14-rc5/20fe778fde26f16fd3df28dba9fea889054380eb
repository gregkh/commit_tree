drm/i915/xelpd: Handle proper AUX interrupt bits

XE_LPD has new AUX interrupt bits for DDI-D and DDI-E that take the
spots that were used by TC5/TC6 on Display12 platforms.

While we're at it, let's convert the bit definitions for all TGL+ aux
bits over to the modern REG_BIT() notation.

v2:
 - Maintain bit order rather than logical order.  (Lucas)
 - Convert surrounding code to REG_BIT() notation.  (Lucas)
