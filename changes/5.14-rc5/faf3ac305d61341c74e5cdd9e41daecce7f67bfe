perf script: Fix memory 'threads' and 'cpus' leaks on exit

ASan reports several memory leaks while running:

  # perf test "82: Use vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames"

Two of these are caused by some refcounts not being decreased on
perf-script exit, namely script.threads and script.cpus.

This patch adds the missing __put calls in a new perf_script__exit
function, which is called at the end of cmd_script.

This patch concludes the fixes of all remaining memory leaks in perf
test "82: Use vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames".
