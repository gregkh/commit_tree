powerpc/opcodes: Add shorter macros for registers for use with PPC_RAW_xx()

Today we have __REG_Rx macros . They are mainly meant for
internal use by macros __PPC_RA() and friends macros which
allows uses like __PPC_RA(R12).

When used with PPC_RAW_xx() macros, it gives a result which is
not very readable.

Add shorter macros _Rx in order to improve readability when
used with PPC_RAW_xx() macros.
