VSOCK: handle VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_CREDIT_REQUEST

The original implementation of the virtio-vsock driver does not
handle a VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_CREDIT_REQUEST as required by the
virtio-vsock specification. The vsock device emulated by
vhost-vsock and the virtio-vsock driver never uses this request,
which was probably why nobody noticed it. However, another
implementation of the device may use this request type.

Hence, this commit introduces a way to handle an explicit credit
request by responding with a corresponding credit update as
required by the virtio-vsock specification.
