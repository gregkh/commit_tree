nvme: use return value from blk_execute_rq()

We don't have an nvme status to report if the driver's .queue_rq()
returns an error without dispatching the requested nvme command. Check
the return value from blk_execute_rq() for all passthrough commands so
the caller may know their command was not successful.

If the command is from the target passthrough interface and fails to
dispatch, synthesize the response back to the host as a internal target
error.
