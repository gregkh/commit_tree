net: sched: fix lockdep_set_class() typo error for sch->seqlock

According to comment in qdisc_alloc(), sch->seqlock's lockdep
class key should be set to qdisc_tx_busylock, due to possible
type error, sch->busylock's lockdep class key is set to
qdisc_tx_busylock, which is duplicated because sch->busylock's
lockdep class key is already set in qdisc_alloc().

So fix it by replacing sch->busylock with sch->seqlock.
