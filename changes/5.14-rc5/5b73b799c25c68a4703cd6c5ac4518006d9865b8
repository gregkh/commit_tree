RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check if the queue_depth has changed during a reconnection

The queue_depth is a module parameter for rtrs_server. It is used on the
client side to determing the queue_depth of the request queue for the RNBD
virtual block device.

During a reconnection event for an already mapped device, in case the
rtrs_server module queue_depth has changed, fail the reconnect attempt.

Also stop further auto reconnection attempts. A manual reconnect via
sysfs has to be triggerred.
