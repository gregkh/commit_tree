net: ocelot: delete call to br_fdb_replay

Not using this driver, I did not realize it doesn't react to
SWITCHDEV_FDB_{ADD,DEL}_TO_DEVICE notifications, but it implements just
the bridge bypass operations (.ndo_fdb_{add,del}). So the call to
br_fdb_replay just produces notifications that are ignored, delete it
for now.
