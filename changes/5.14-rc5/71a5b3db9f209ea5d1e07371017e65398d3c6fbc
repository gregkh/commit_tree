powerpc/lib/code-patching: Set up Strict RWX patching earlier

setup_text_poke_area() is a late init call so it runs before
mark_rodata_ro() and after the init calls. This lets all the init code
patching simply write to their locations. In the future, kprobes is
going to allocate its instruction pages RO which means they will need
setup_text__poke_area() to have been already called for their code
patching. However, init_kprobes() (which allocates and patches some
instruction pages) is an early init call so it happens before
setup_text__poke_area().

start_kernel() calls poking_init() before any of the init calls. On
powerpc, poking_init() is currently a nop. setup_text_poke_area() relies
on kernel virtual memory, cpu hotplug and per_cpu_areas being setup.
setup_per_cpu_areas(), boot_cpu_hotplug_init() and mm_init() are called
before poking_init().

Turn setup_text_poke_area() into poking_init().
