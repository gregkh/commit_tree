spi: stm32: fixes pm_runtime calls in probe/remove

Add pm_runtime calls in probe/probe error path and remove
in order to be consistent in all places in ordering and
ensure that pm_runtime is disabled prior to resources used
by the SPI controller.

This patch also fixes the 2 following warnings on driver remove:
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 743 at drivers/clk/clk.c:594 clk_core_disable_lock+0x18/0x24
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 743 at drivers/clk/clk.c:476 clk_unprepare+0x24/0x2c
