media: hantro: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
added pm_runtime_resume_and_get() in order to automatically handle
dev->power.usage_count decrement on errors.

While there's nothing wrong with the current usage on this driver,
as we're getting rid of the pm_runtime_get_sync() call all over
the media subsystem, let's remove the last occurrence on this
driver.
