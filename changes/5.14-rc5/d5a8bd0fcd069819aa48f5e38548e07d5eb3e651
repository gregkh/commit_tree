perf mem: Disable 'mem-loads-aux' group before reporting

For some platforms, such as Alderlake, the 'mem-loads' event is required
to use together with 'mem-loads-aux' within a group and 'mem-loads-aux'
must be the group leader. Now we disable this group before reporting
because 'mem-loads-aux' is just an auxiliary event. It doesn't carry
any valid memory load result. If we show the 'mem-loads-aux' +
'mem-loads' as a group in report, it needs many of changes but they
are totally unnecessary.
