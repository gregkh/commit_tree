thunderbolt: Add wake from DisplayPort

Latest USB4 spec added a new wake bit for DisplayPort so add this to the
driver when runtime suspending. This way wake up the domain when a new
monitor is plugged in to any of the device routers.

Also do the same for pre-USB4 devices through the link controller
registers as documented in chapter 13 of the USB4 spec.
