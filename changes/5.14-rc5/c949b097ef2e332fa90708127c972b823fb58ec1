userfaultfd/shmem: support minor fault registration for shmem

This patch allows shmem-backed VMAs to be registered for minor faults.
Minor faults are appropriately relayed to userspace in the fault path, for
VMAs with the relevant flag.

This commit doesn't hook up the UFFDIO_CONTINUE ioctl for shmem-backed
minor faults, though, so userspace doesn't yet have a way to resolve such
faults.

Because of this, we also don't yet advertise this as a supported feature.
That will be done in a separate commit when the feature is fully
implemented.
