scsi: megaraid_mm: Fix end of loop tests for list_for_each_entry()

The list_for_each_entry() iterator, "adapter" in this code, can never be
NULL.  If we exit the loop without finding the correct adapter then
"adapter" points invalid memory that is an offset from the list head.  This
will eventually lead to memory corruption and presumably a kernel crash.
