drm/i915: WA for zero memory channel

Commit c457d9cf256e ("drm/i915: Make sure we have enough memory
bandwidth on ICL") assumes that we always have a non-zero
dram_info->channels and uses it as a divisor.
We need num memory channels to be at least 1 for sane bw limits
checking, even when PCode returns 0 or there is a error reading it, so
lets force it to 1 in this case.
