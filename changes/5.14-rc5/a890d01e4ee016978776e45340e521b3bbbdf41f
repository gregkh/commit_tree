io_uring: fix poll requests leaking second poll entries

For pure poll requests, it doesn't remove the second poll wait entry
when it's done, neither after vfs_poll() or in the poll completion
handler. We should remove the second poll wait entry.
And we use io_poll_remove_double() rather than io_poll_remove_waitqs()
since the latter has some redundant logic.
