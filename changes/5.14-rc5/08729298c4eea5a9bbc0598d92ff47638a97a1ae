Input: resistive-adc-touch - replace OF headers with proper ones

The driver is actually OF independent and doesn't need anything from OF (*).
Replace OF headers with mod_devicetable.h and property.h.

*) use of of_match_ptr() is actually wrong here, since it may provoke
   a compiler to warn about unused variable.
