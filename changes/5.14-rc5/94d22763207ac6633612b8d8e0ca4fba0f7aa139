PCI: hv: Fix a race condition when removing the device

On removing the device, any work item (hv_pci_devices_present() or
hv_pci_eject_device()) scheduled on workqueue hbus->wq may still be running
and race with hv_pci_remove().

This can happen because the host may send PCI_EJECT or PCI_BUS_RELATIONS(2)
and decide to rescind the channel immediately after that.

Fix this by flushing/destroying the workqueue of hbus before doing hbus remove.
