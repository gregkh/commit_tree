kfence: defer kfence_test_init to ensure that kunit debugfs is created

kfence_test_init and kunit_init both use the same level late_initcall,
which means if kfence_test_init linked ahead of kunit_init,
kfence_test_init will get a NULL debugfs_rootdir as parent dentry, then
kfence_test_init and kfence_debugfs_init both create a debugfs node
named "kfence" under debugfs_mount->mnt_root, and it will throw out
"debugfs: Directory 'kfence' with parent '/' already present!" with
EEXIST.  So kfence_test_init should be deferred.
