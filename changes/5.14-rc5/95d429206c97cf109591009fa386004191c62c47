platform/x86: think-lmi: Add pending_reboot support

The Think-lmi driver was missing pending_reboot support as it wasn't
available from the BIOS. Turns out this is really useful to have from
user space so implementing from a purely SW point of view.

Thanks to Mario Limonciello for guidance on how fwupd would use this.
