ASoC: rt5645: Avoid upgrading static warnings to errors

One of the fixes reverted as part of the UMN fallout was actually fine,
however rather than undoing the revert the process that handled all this
stuff resulted in a patch which attempted to add extra error checks
instead.  Unfortunately this new change wasn't really based on a good
understanding of the subsystem APIs and bypassed the usual patch flow
without ensuring it was reviewed by people with subsystem knowledge and
was merged as a fix rather than during the merge window.

The effect of the new fix is to upgrade what were previously warnings on
static data in the code to hard errors on that data.  If this actually
happens then it would break existing systems, if it doesn't happen then
the change has no effect so this was not a safe change to apply as a fix
to the release candidates.  Since the new code has not been tested and
doesn't in practice improve error handling revert it instead, and also
drop the original revert since the original fix was fine.  This takes
the driver back to what it was in -rc1.
