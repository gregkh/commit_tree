net: fec: add ndo_select_queue to fix TX bandwidth fluctuations

As we know that AVB is enabled by default, and the ENET IP design is
queue 0 for best effort, queue 1&2 for AVB Class A&B. Bandwidth of each
queue 1&2 set in driver is 50%, TX bandwidth fluctuated when selecting
tx queues randomly with FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk available.

This patch adds ndo_select_queue callback to select queues for
transmitting to fix this issue. It will always return queue 0 if this is
not a vlan packet, and return queue 1 or 2 based on priority of vlan
packet.

You may complain that in fact we only use single queue for trasmitting
if we are not targeted to VLAN. Yes, but seems we have no choice, since
AVB is enabled when the driver probed, we can't switch this feature
dynamicly. After compare multiple queues to single queue, TX throughput
almost no improvement.

One way we can implemet is to configure the driver to multiple queues
with Round-robin scheme by default. Then add ndo_setup_tc callback to
enable/disable AVB feature for users. Unfortunately, ENET AVB IP seems
not follow the standard 802.1Qav spec. We only can program
DMAnCFG[IDLE_SLOPE] field to calculate bandwidth fraction. And idle
slope is restricted to certain valus (a total of 19). It's far away from
CBS QDisc implemented in Linux TC framework. If you strongly suggest to do
this, I think we only can support limited numbers of bandwidth and reject
others, but it's really urgly and wried.

With this patch, VLAN tagged packets route to queue 0/1/2 based on vlan
priority; VLAN untagged packets route to queue 0.
