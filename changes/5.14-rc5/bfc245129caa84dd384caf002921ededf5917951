dt-bindings: remoteproc: pru: Update bindings for K3 AM64x SoCs

The K3 AM64x SoCs have an ICSSG IP that is similar to the IP revisions
used on K3 AM65x SR2.0 and J721E SoCs. The ICSSG IP on K3 AM64x SoCs
have the same set of two PRU cores, two RTU cores and two auxiliary PRU
cores called Transmit PRUs (Tx_PRUs). There are some minor differences
surrounding the PRU cores like different Broadside RAM (BSRAM) sizes
w.r.t AM65x SR1.0 SoCs.

Update the PRU remoteproc bindings for these PRU cores on AM64x SoCs.
