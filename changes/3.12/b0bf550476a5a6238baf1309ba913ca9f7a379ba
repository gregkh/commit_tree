ALSA: hdspm - AES32: Fix TCO sync check reporting

HDSPM_tco_lock and HDSPM_tcoLock were too close, so the previous code
didn't honour the difference between the two.

Let's be more verbose and use HDSPM_tcoLockMadi for MADI cards,
HDSPM_tcoLockAes for AES(32) and fix the code that makes use of both.
