xfs: add capability check to free eofblocks ioctl

Check for CAP_SYS_ADMIN since the caller can truncate preallocated
blocks from files they do not own nor have write access to. A more
fine grained access check was considered: require the caller to
specify their own uid/gid and to use inode_permission to check for
write, but this would not catch the case of an inode not reachable
via path traversal from the callers mount namespace.

Add check for read-only filesystem to free eofblocks ioctl.
