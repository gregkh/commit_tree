ASoC: dapm: Make widget power register settings more flexible

Currently the DAPM code is limited to only setting or clearing a single bit in a
register to power a widget up or down. This patch extends the DAPM code to be
more flexible in that regard and allow widgets to use arbitrary values to be
used to put a widget in either on or off state.

Since the snd_soc_dapm_widget struct already contains a on_val and off_val field
no additional fields need to be added and in fact the invert field can even be
removed. Also the generated code is slightly smaller.
