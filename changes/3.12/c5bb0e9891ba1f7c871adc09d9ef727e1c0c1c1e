sfc: Use proper macros to declare and access MCDI arrays

A few functions are using heap buffers; change them to use stack
buffers as we really don't need to resort to the heap for a 252
byte buffer in process context.

MC_CMD_MEMCPY is quite weird in that it can use inline data placed in
the request buffer after the array of records.  Thus there are two
variable-length arrays and we can't use the normal accessors for
the second.  So we have to use _MCDI_PTR() in efx_sriov_memcpy().
