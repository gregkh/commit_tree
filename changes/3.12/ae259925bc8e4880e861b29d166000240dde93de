drivers/rtc/rtc-hid-sensor-time.c: add module alias to let the module load automatically

In order to get the module automatically loaded by hotplug mechanisms a
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is needed.

Therefore add one.

This makes it also possible to use a module name other than
HID-SENSOR-2000a0 which isn't very descriptive in kernel messages.
