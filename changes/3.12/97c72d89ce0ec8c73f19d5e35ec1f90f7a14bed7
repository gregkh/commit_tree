ARM: cacheflush: don't bother rounding to nearest vma

do_cache_op finds the lowest VMA contained in the specified address
range and rounds the range to cover only the mapped addresses.

Since commit 4542b6a0fa6b ("ARM: 7365/1: drop unused parameter from
flush_cache_user_range") the VMA is not used for anything else in this
code and seeing as the low-level cache flushing routines return -EFAULT
if the address is not valid, there is no need for this range truncation.

This patch removes the VMA handling code from the cacheflushing syscall.
