cpufreq: improve error checking on return values of __cpufreq_governor()

The __cpufreq_governor() function can fail in rare cases especially
if there are bugs in cpufreq drivers.  Thus we must stop processing
as soon as this routine fails, otherwise it may result in undefined
behavior.

This patch adds error checking code whenever this routine is called
from any place.
