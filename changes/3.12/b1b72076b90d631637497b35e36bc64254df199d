net: sctp: probe: allow more advanced ingress filtering by mark

This is a follow-up commit for commit b1dcdc68b1f4 ("net: tcp_probe:
allow more advanced ingress filtering by mark") that allows for
advanced SCTP probe module filtering based on skb mark (for a more
detailed description and advantages using mark, refer to b1dcdc68b1f4).
The current option to filter by a given port is still being preserved.
