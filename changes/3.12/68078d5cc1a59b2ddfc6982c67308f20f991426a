[SCSI] ufs: Set fDeviceInit flag to initiate device initialization

Allow UFS device to complete its initialization and accept
SCSI commands by setting fDeviceInit flag. The device may take
time for this operation and hence the host should poll until
fDeviceInit flag is toggled to zero. This step is mandated by
UFS device specification for device initialization completion.
