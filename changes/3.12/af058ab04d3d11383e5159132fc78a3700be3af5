x86-32, ftrace: Fix static ftrace when early microcode is enabled

Early microcode loading runs C code before paging is enabled on 32
bits.  Since ftrace puts a hook into every function, that hook needs
to be safe to execute in the pre-paging environment.  This is
currently true for dynamic ftrace but not for static ftrace.

Static ftrace is obsolescent and assumed to not be
performance-critical, so we can simply test that the stack pointer
falls within the valid range of kernel addresses.
