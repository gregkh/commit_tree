staging: comedi: ni_labpc: fix possible double-free of dma_buffer

If `labpc_attach()` allocates memory for `devpriv->dma_buffer` but fails
to request a DMA channel, it frees `devpriv->dma_buffer` but leaves the
pointer set.  Later, `labpc_detach()` frees `devpriv->dma_buffer` again,
which means it has been freed twice in this case.

Fix it by only setting `devpriv->dma_buffer` in `labpc_attach()` if the
DMA channel was requested successfully.
