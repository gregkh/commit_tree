drm/i915: Embed the ring->private within the struct intel_ring_buffer

We now have more devices using ring->private than not, and they all want
the same structure. Worse, I would like to use a scratch page from
outside of intel_ringbuffer.c and so for convenience would like to reuse
ring->private. Embed the object into the struct intel_ringbuffer so that
we can keep the code clean.
