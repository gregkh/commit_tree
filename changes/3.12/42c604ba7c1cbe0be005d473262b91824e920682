ARM: OMAP2+: fix wrong address when loading PRM_FRAC_INCREMENTOR_DENUMERATOR_RELOAD

The denominator should be load from INCREMENTOR_DENUMERATOR_RELOAD_OFFSET
rather than INCREMENTER_NUMERATOR_OFFSET.

This is more likely a typo, since INCREMENTER_DENUMERATOR_RELOAD[23:17] is
reserved. It seems that it won't make much trouble without this fix, because
the useful [11:0] bits are mask and set the right value. Anyway, reading
from a right address is better choice.
