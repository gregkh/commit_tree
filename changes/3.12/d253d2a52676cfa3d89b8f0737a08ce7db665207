intel_pstate: Improve accuracy by not truncating until final result

This patch addresses Bug 60727
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60727)
which was due to the truncation of intermediate values in the
calculations, which causes the code to consistently underestimate the
current cpu frequency, specifically 100% cpu utilization was truncated
down to the setpoint of 97%. This patch fixes the problem by keeping
the results of all intermediate calculations as fixed point numbers
rather scaling them back and forth between integers and fixed point.
