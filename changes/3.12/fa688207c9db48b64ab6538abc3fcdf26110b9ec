smp: quit unconditionally enabling irq in on_each_cpu_mask and on_each_cpu_cond

As in commit f21afc25f9ed ("smp.h: Use local_irq_{save,restore}() in
!SMP version of on_each_cpu()"), we don't want to enable irqs if they
are not already enabled.  There are currently no known problematical
callers of these functions, but since it is a known failure pattern, we
preemptively fix them.

Since they are not trivial functions, make them non-inline by moving
them to up.c.  This also makes it so we don't have to fix #include
dependancies for preempt_{disable,enable}.
