ARM: davinci: uart: move to devid based clk_get

For modules having single clock, clk_get should be done with dev_id.
But current davinci implementation handles multiple instances
of the UART devices with single platform_device_register. Hence clk_get
is based on con_id rather than dev_id, this is not correct. Do
platform_device_register for each instance and clk_get on dev_id.
