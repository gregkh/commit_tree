GFS2: Take glock reference in examine_bucket()

We need to check the glock ref counter in a race free way
in order to ensure that the gfs2_glock_hold() call will
succeed. The easiest way to do that is to simply take the
reference count early in the common code of examine_bucket,
skipping any glocks with zero ref count.

That means that the examiner functions all need to put their
reference on the glock once they've performed their function.
