drm/exynos: fimd: replace struct fb_videomode with videomode

The patch replaces all occurrences of struct fb_videomode by
more accurate struct videomode. The change allows to remove
mode conversion function and simplifies clock divider calculation.
Clock configuration is moved to separate function.
