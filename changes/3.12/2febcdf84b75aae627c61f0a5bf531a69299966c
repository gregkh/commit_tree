mtd: gpmi: set the BCH's geometry with the ecc info

If the nand chip provides us the ECC info, we can use it firstly.
The set_geometry_by_ecc_info() will use the ECC info, and
calculate the parameters we need.

Rename the old code to legacy_set_geometry() which will takes effect
when there is no ECC info from the nand chip or we fails in the ECC info case.
