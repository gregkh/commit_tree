iscsi-target: Only perform wait_for_tasks when performing shutdown

This patch changes transport_generic_free_cmd() to only wait_for_tasks
when shutdown=true is passed to iscsit_free_cmd().

With the advent of >= v3.10 iscsi-target code using se_cmd->cmd_kref,
the extra wait_for_tasks with shutdown=false is unnecessary, and may
end up causing an extra context switch when releasing WRITEs.
