drm/i915: extract rps interrupt enable/disable helpers

The VECS enabling required some changes to how rps interrupts are
enabled/disabled since VECS interrupts are handling with the PM
interrupt registers.

But now that the pre/postinstall sequences is identical for all
platforms with rps support (snb, ivb, hsw, vlv) we can also use the
exact same sequence to actually enable the rps interrupts. Strictly
speaking using spinlocks is overkill on snb/ivb & vlv since they have
no VECS ring, but imo that's more than made up by the common code.

Hence this just unifies the vlv code with the snb-hsw code which
matched exactly before the VECS enabling. See

    drm/i915: make PM interrupt writes non-destructive

for why the gen6 code (shared between snb, ivb and hsw) needed to be
changed originally.

v3: Improve the commit message to more clearly spell out why we want
to unify the code and what exactly changes.
