ARM: 7830/1: delay: don't bother reporting bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo

Now that we support a timer-backed delay loop, I'm quickly getting sick
and tired of people complaining that their beloved bogomips value has
decreased. You know who you are!

This patch removes the bogomips line from /proc/cpuinfo, based on the
reasoning that any program parsing this is already broken and, as such,
won't be further broken if the field is removed.
