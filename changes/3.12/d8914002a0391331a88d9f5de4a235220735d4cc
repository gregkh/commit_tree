xfs: inode buffers may not be valid during recovery readahead

CRC enabled filesystems fail log recovery with 100% reliability on
xfstests xfs/085 with the following failure:

XFS (vdb): Mounting Filesystem
XFS (vdb): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)
XFS (vdb): Corruption detected. Unmount and run xfs_repair
XFS (vdb): bad inode magic/vsn daddr 144 #0 (magic=0)
XFS: Assertion failed: 0, file: fs/xfs/xfs_inode_buf.c, line: 95

The problem is that the inode buffer has not been recovered before
the readahead on the inode buffer is issued. The checkpoint being
recovered actually allocates the inode chunk we are doing readahead
from, so what comes from disk during readahead is essentially
random and the verifier barfs on it.

This inode buffer readahead problem affects non-crc filesystems,
too, but xfstests does not trigger it at all on such
configurations....
