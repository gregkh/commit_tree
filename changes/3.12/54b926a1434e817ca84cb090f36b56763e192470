Bluetooth: Move the tty initialization and cleanup out of open/close

Move the tty_struct initialization from rfcomm_tty_open() to
rfcomm_tty_install() and do the same for the cleanup moving the code from
rfcomm_tty_close() to rfcomm_tty_cleanup().

Add also extra error handling in rfcomm_tty_install() because, unlike
.open()/.close(), .cleanup() is not called if .install() fails.
