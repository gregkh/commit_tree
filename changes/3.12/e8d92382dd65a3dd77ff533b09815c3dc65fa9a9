NFS: When displaying session slot numbers, use "%u" consistently

Clean up, since slot and sequence numbers are all unsigned anyway.

Among other things, squelch compiler warnings:

linux/fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c: In function ‘nfs4_setup_sequence’:
linux/fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c:703:2: warning: signed and unsigned type in
	conditional expression [-Wsign-compare]

and

linux/fs/nfs/nfs4session.c: In function ‘nfs4_alloc_slot’:
linux/fs/nfs/nfs4session.c:151:31: warning: signed and unsigned type in
	conditional expression [-Wsign-compare]
