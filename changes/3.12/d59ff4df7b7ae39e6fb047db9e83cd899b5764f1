f2fs: fix wrong BUG_ON condition

This patch removes a false-alaramed BUG_ON.
The previous BUG_ON condition didn't cover the following true scenario.

In f2fs_add_link, 1) get_new_data_page gives an uptodate page successfully,
and then, 2) init_inode_metadata returns -ENOSPC.
At this moment, a new clean data page is remained in the page cache, but its
block address still indicates NEW_ADDR.
After then, even if sync is called, this clean data page cannot be written to
the disk due to the clean state.

So this means that get_lock_data_page should make a new empty page when its
block address is NEW_ADDR and its page is not uptodated.
