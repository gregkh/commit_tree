tcp: Always set options to 0 before calling tcp_established_options

tcp_established_options assumes opts->options is 0 before calling,
as it read modify writes it.

For the tcp_current_mss() case the opts structure is not zeroed,
so this can be done with uninitialized values.

This is ok, because ->options is not read in this path.
But it's still better to avoid the operation on the uninitialized
field. This shuts up a static code analyzer, and presumably
may help the optimizer.
