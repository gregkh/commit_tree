Btrfs: set qgroup_ulist to be null after calling ulist_free()

We call ulist_free(qgroup_ulist) in btrfs_free_qgroup_config(),
and btrfs_free_qgroup_config() may be called in two cases:

(1)umount filesystem
(2)disabling quota

However, if we firstly disable quota and then umount filesystem,
a double free happens. Fix it.
