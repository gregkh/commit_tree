dm thin: always return -ENOSPC if no_free_space is set

If pool has 'no_free_space' set it means a previous allocation already
determined the pool has no free space (and failed that allocation with
-ENOSPC).  By always returning -ENOSPC if 'no_free_space' is set, we do
not allow the pool to oscillate between allocating blocks and then not.

But a side-effect of this determinism is that if a user wants to be able
to allocate new blocks they'll need to reload the pool's table (to clear
the 'no_free_space' flag).  This reload will happen automatically if the
pool's data volume is resized.  But if the user takes action to free a
lot of space by deleting snapshot volumes, etc the pool will no longer
allow data allocations to continue without an intervening table reload.
