bridge: inherit slave devices needed_headroom

Some slave devices may have set a dev->needed_headroom value which is
different than the default one, most likely in order to prepend a
hardware descriptor in front of the Ethernet frame to send. Whenever a
new slave is added to a bridge, ensure that we update the
needed_headroom value accordingly to account for the slave
needed_headroom value.
