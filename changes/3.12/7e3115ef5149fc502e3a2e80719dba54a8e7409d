sched/balancing: Fix cfs_rq->task_h_load calculation

Patch a003a2 (sched: Consider runnable load average in move_tasks())
sets all top-level cfs_rqs' h_load to rq->avg.load_avg_contrib, which is
always 0. This mistype leads to all tasks having weight 0 when load
balancing in a cpu-cgroup enabled setup. There obviously should be sum
of weights of all runnable tasks there instead. Fix it.
