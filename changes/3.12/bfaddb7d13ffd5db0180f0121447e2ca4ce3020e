msm_serial: Switch clock consumer strings and simplify code

In downstream kernel we've standardized the clock consumer names
that MSM device drivers use. Replace the uart specific clock
names in this driver with the more standard 'core' and 'iface'
names. Also simplify the code by assuming that clk_prepare_enable
and clk_disable_unprepare() will properly check for NULL pointers
(it will because MSM uses the common clock framework).
