driver/net: enic: Try DMA 64 first, then failover to DMA

In servers with more than 1.1 TB of RAM, the existing 40/32 bit DMA
could cause failure as the DMA-able address could go outside the range
addressable using 40/32 bits.

The following patch first tried 64 bit DMA if possible, failover to 32
bit.
