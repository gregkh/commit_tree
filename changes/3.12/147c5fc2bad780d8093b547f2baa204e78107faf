sched/fair: Shrink sg_lb_stats and play memset games

We can shrink sg_lb_stats because rq::nr_running is an unsigned int
and cpu numbers are 'int'

Before:
  sgs:        /* size: 72, cachelines: 2, members: 10 */
  sds:        /* size: 184, cachelines: 3, members: 7 */

After:
  sgs:        /* size: 56, cachelines: 1, members: 10 */
  sds:        /* size: 152, cachelines: 3, members: 7 */

Further we can avoid clearing all of sds since we do a total
clear/assignment of sg_stats in update_sg_lb_stats() with exception of
busiest_stat.avg_load which is referenced in update_sd_pick_busiest().
