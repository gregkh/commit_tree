SH7619: fix Ether support

The 'sh_eth' driver's probe will crash as the platform code is hopelessly behind
the platform data -- it passes PHY ID instead of 'struct sh_eth_plat_data *'.
Strangely, both commit d88a3ea6fa4c (SH7619 add ethernet controler support) that
added the platform code and commit 71557a37adb5 ([netdrvr] sh_eth: Add  SH7619
support)  were done  in about  the same time, yet the latter one added 'struct
sh_eth_plat_data' and the platform code didn't ever get updated...

Add the proper platform data and fix off-by-one memory resource end error, while
at it...
