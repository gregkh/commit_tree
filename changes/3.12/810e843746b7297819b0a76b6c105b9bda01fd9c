deb-pkg: split debug symbols in their own package

This can reduce almost 3 times the size of the linux-image package,
while keeping the debug symbols available for this particular build, in
their own package.

This mimics the way kernels are built in debian, ubuntu, or with
make-kpkg, and comes at the price of a small slowdown in the building of
packages.
