ocfs2: clean up dead code in ocfs2_acl_from_xattr()

In ocfs2_acl_from_xattr(), if size is less than sizeof(struct
posix_acl_entry), it returns ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) directly.  Then assign (size
/ sizeof(struct posix_acl_entry)) to count which will be at least 1, that
means the following branch (count < 0) and (count == 0) will never be
true.
