drm/i915: enable trickle feed on Haswell

We shouldn't disable the trickle feed bits on Haswell. Our
documentation explicitly says the trickle feed bits of PRI_CTL and
CUR_CTL should not be programmed to 1, and the hardware engineer also
asked us to not program the SPR_CTL field to 1. Leaving the bits as 1
could cause underflows.
