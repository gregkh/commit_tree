usb: phy: tegra: Fix wrong PHY parameters

Some of the PHY parameters are not set according to the TRMs:

- UTMIP_FS_PREABMLE_J should be set, not cleared
- UTMIP_XCVR_LSBIAS_SEL should be cleared, not set
- UTMIP_PD_CHRG should be set in host mode and cleared in device mode
- UTMIP_XCVR_SETUP is a two-part field; the upper bits were not set
  properly
