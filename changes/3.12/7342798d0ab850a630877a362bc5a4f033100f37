ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Drop sun field from struct acpiphp_slot

If the slot unique number is passed as an additional argument to
acpiphp_register_hotplug_slot(), the 'sun' field in struct
acpiphp_slot is only used by ibm_[s|g]et_attention_status(),
but then it's more efficient to store it in struct slot.

Thus move the 'sun' field from struct acpiphp_slot to struct slot
changing its data type to unsigned int in the process, and redefine
acpiphp_register_hotplug_slot() to take the slot number as separate
argument.
