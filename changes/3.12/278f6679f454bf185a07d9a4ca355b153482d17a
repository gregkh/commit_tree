reiserfs: locking, handle nested locks properly

The reiserfs write lock replaced the BKL and uses similar semantics.

Frederic's locking code makes a distinction between when the lock is nested
and when it's being acquired/released, but I don't think that's the right
distinction to make.

The right distinction is between the lock being released at end-of-use and
the lock being released for a schedule. The unlock should return the depth
and the lock should restore it, rather than the other way around as it is now.

This patch implements that and adds a number of places where the lock
should be dropped.
