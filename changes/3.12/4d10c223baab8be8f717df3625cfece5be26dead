Need permit '.cranges' section for sh64 architecture, or modpost will
report warning:

  WARNING: init/built-in.o (.cranges): unexpected non-allocatable section.
  Did you forget to use "ax"/"aw" in a .S file?
  Note that for example <linux/init.h> contains
  section definitions for use in .S files.
