cfg80211/mac80211: use reduced txpower for 5 and 10 MHz

Some regulations (like germany, but also FCC) express their transmission
power limit in dBm/MHz or mW/MHz. To cope with that and be on the safe
side, reduce the maximum power to half (10 MHz) or quarter (5 MHz)
when operating on these reduced bandwidth channels.
