PCI: tegra: replace devm_request_and_ioremap by devm_ioremap_resource

Use devm_ioremap_resource instead of devm_request_and_ioremap.

This was done using the semantic patch
scripts/coccinelle/api/devm_ioremap_resource.cocci

Error-handling code was manually removed from the associated calls to
platform_get_resource.

Adjust the comment at the third platform_get_resource_byname to make clear
why ioremap is not done at this point.
