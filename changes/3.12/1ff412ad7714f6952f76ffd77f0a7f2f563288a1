bonding: change the bond's vlan syncing functions with the standard ones

Now we have vlan_vids_add/del_by_dev() which serve the same purpose as
bond's bond_add/del_vlans_on_slave() with the good side effect of
reverting the changes if one of the additions fails.
There's only 1 change in the behaviour of enslave: if adding of the
vlans to the slave fails, we'll fail the enslaving because otherwise we
might delete some vlan that wasn't added by the bonding.
The only way this may happen is with ENOMEM currently, so we're in trouble
anyway.
