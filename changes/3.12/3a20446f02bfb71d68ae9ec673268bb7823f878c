USB: EHCI: keep better track of resuming ports

The ehci-hcd driver isn't as careful as it should be about the way it
uses ehci->resuming_ports.  One of the omissions was fixed recently by
commit 47a64a13d54 (USB: EHCI: Fix resume signalling on remote
wakeup), but there are other places that need attention:

	When a port's suspend feature is explicitly cleared, the
	corresponding bit in resuming_ports should be set and the core
	should be notified about the port resume.

	We don't need to clear a resuming_ports bit when a reset
	completes.
