ARC: Fix __udelay calculation

Cast usecs to u64, to ensure that the (usecs * 4295 * HZ)
multiplication is 64 bit.

Initially, the (usecs * 4295 * HZ) part was done as a 32 bit
multiplication, with the result casted to 64 bit. This led to some bits
falling off, causing a "DMA initialization error" in the stmmac Ethernet
driver, due to a premature timeout.
