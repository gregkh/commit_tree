Revert "perf symbols: Demangle cloned functions"

This reverts commit de95ab53645a2f0015e0f68ee723f18dce2b8b51.

Markus Trippelsdorf reported that this commit broke 'perf top':

 > I just see a gray screen with no text at all. Sometimes the
 > following error messages are printed:
 >
 >  *** Error in `perf': invalid fastbin entry (free): 0x00000000029b18c0
 >  ***
 >  *** Error in `perf': malloc(): memory corruption (fast): 0x0000000000ee0b10 ***

While this code is fixable, the commit itself fails on several levels:

 - it should have been a separate helper function
 - why the heck does it do strchr() twice
 - it casts a const char * over into char *
 - sloppy style
 - it's not even a regression fix!

So lets revert it and re-try the patch in v3.13.
