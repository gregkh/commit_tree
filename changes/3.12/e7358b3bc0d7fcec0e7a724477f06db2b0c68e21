context_tracking: Split low level state headers

We plan to use the context tracking static key on inline
vtime APIs. For this we need to include the context tracking
headers from those of vtime.

However vtime headers need to stay low level because they are
included in hardirq.h that mostly contains standalone
definitions. But context_tracking.h includes sched.h for
a few task_struct references, therefore it wouldn't be sensible
to include it from vtime.h

To solve this, lets split the context tracking headers and move
out the pure state definitions that only require a few low level
headers. We can safely include that small part in vtime.h later.
