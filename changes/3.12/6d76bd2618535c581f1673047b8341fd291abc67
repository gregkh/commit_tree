n_tty: Make N_TTY ldisc receive path lockless

n_tty has a single-producer/single-consumer input model;
use lockless publish instead.

Use termios_rwsem to exclude both consumer and producer while
changing or resetting buffer indices, eg., when flushing. Also,
claim exclusive termios_rwsem to safely retrieve the buffer
indices from a thread other than consumer or producer
(eg., TIOCINQ ioctl).

Note the read_tail is published _after_ clearing the newline
indicator in read_flags to avoid racing the producer.

Drop read_lock spinlock.
