ARM: shmobile: Only build clocks when COMMON_CLK=n

Move shared clock.c file and per-SoC clock-xxx.c files
to only build when CONFIG_COMMON_CLK != y.

The regular ARCH_SHMOBILE case with legacy SH clock framework
will build just as before with this patch applied, however
the case when COMMON_CLK=y will exclude all the clock files.
