ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Drop flags field from struct acpiphp_bridge

The only bridge flag used by the ACPI-based PCI hotplug (ACPIPHP)
code is BRIDGE_HAS_EJ0, but it is only used by the event handling
function hotplug_event() and if that flag is set, the corresponding
function flag FUNC_HAS_EJ0 is set as well, so that bridge flag is
redundant.

For this reason, drop BRIDGE_HAS_EJ0 and all code referring to it
and since it is the only bridge flag defined, drop the flags field
from struct acpiphp_bridge entirely.
