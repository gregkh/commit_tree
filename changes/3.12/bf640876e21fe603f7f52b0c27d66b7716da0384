KVM: s390: Make KVM_HVA_ERR_BAD usable on s390

Current common code uses PAGE_OFFSET to indicate a bad host virtual address.
As this check won't work on architectures that don't map kernel and user memory
into the same address space (e.g. s390), such architectures can now provide
their own KVM_HVA_ERR_BAD defines.
