drm/imx: kill firstopen callback

This thing seems to do some kind of delayed setup. Really, real kms
drivers shouldn't do that at all. Either stuff needs to be dynamically
hotplugged or the driver setup sequence needs to be fixed.

This patch here just moves the setup at the very end of the driver
load callback, with the locking adjusted accordingly.

v2: Also move the corresponding put from ->lastclose to ->unload.
