xfs: Reduce allocations during CIL insertion

Now that we have the size of the object before the formatting pass
is called, we can allocation the log vector and it's buffer in a
single allocation rather than two separate allocations.

Store the size of the allocated buffer in the log vector so that
we potentially avoid allocation for future modifications of the
object.

While touching this code, remove the IOP_FORMAT definition.
