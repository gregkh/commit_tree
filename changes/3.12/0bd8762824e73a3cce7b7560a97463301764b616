ip6tnl: add x-netns support

This patch allows to switch the netns when packet is encapsulated or
decapsulated. In other word, the encapsulated packet is received in a netns,
where the lookup is done to find the tunnel. Once the tunnel is found, the
packet is decapsulated and injecting into the corresponding interface which
stands to another netns.

When one of the two netns is removed, the tunnel is destroyed.
