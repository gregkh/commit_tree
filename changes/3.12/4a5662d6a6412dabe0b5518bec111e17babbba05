msm_serial: Fix NUL byte output on UARTDM

UARTDM serial devices require us to wait for the entire TX fifo
to drain before we can change the contents of the NCF_TX
register. Furthermore, if we write any characters to the TX fifo
within the same clock cycle of changing the NCF_TX register the
NCF_TX register won't latch properly.

To fix these issues we should read back the NCF_TX register to
delay any TX fifo accesses by a clock cycle and we should wait
for the TX fifo to drain (instead of just waiting for the fifo to
be ready to receive more characters). Failure to do so leads to
random NUL bytes interspersed in the output.
