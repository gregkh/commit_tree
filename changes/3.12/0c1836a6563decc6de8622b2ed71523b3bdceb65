thermal: exynos: Move exynos_thermal.h from include/* to driver/* folder

This patch renames and moves include/linux/platform_data/exynos_thermal.h to
drivers/thermal/samsung/exynos_tmu.h. This file movement is needed as exynos
SOC's are not supporting non-DT based platforms and this file now just contains
exynos tmu driver related definations.
Also struct freq_clip_table is now moved to exynos_thermal_common.c as it fixes
the compilation issue occuring because now this new tmu header file is included
in tmu driver c file and not in the common thermal header file.
