PCI: pciehp: Add reset_slot() method

PCIe hotplug has a bus per slot, so we can just use a normal
secondary bus reset.  However, if a slot supports surprise removal,
a bus reset can be seen as a presence detection change triggering
a hot-remove followed by a hot-add.  Disable presence detection from
triggering an interrupt or being polled around the bus reset.
