pinctrl: palmas: do not abort pin configuration for BIAS_DEFAULT

Recent movement of all configurations of pin in the single call of
pin_config_set(), it is aborting configuration if BIAS_PULL_PIN_DEFAULT
is selected as return of configuration.

The original idea was to just avoid any update on register for pull up/down
configuration if this option is selected.

Fixing this by just bypassing any register update for BIAS_PULL_PIN_DEFAULT
and continuing the remaining configuration.
