DMA: shdma: switch all __iomem pointers to void

In the shdma driver __iomem pointers are used to point to hardware
registers.  Using typed pointers like "u32 __iomem *" in this case is
inconvenient, because then offsets, added to such pointers, have to be
devided by sizeof(u32) or similar. Switch the driver to use void
pointers, which avoids this clumsiness.
