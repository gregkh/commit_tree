tile: avoid recursive backtrace faults

This change adds support for avoiding recursive backtracer crashes;
we haven't seen this in practice other than when things are seriously
corrupt, but it may help avoid losing the root cause of a crash.

Also, don't abort kernel backtracers for invalid userspace PC's.
If we do, we lose the ability to backtrace through a userspace
call to a bad address above PAGE_OFFSET, even though that it can
be perfectly reasonable to continue the backtrace in such a case.
