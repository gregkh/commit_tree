Revert "epoll: use freezable blocking call"

This reverts commit 1c441e921201 (epoll: use freezable blocking call)
which is reported to cause user space memory corruption to happen
after suspend to RAM.

Since it appears to be extremely difficult to root cause this
problem, it is best to revert the offending commit and try to address
the original issue in a better way later.
