sparc64: Fix ITLB handler of null page

1)Use kvmap_itlb_longpath instead of kvmap_dtlb_longpath.

2)Handle page #0 only, don't handle page #1: bleu -> blu

 (KERNBASE is 0x400000, so #1 does not exist too. But everything
  is possible in the future. Fix to not to have problems later.)

3)Remove unused kvmap_itlb_nonlinear.
