drm: remove procfs code, take 2

So almost two years ago I've tried to nuke the procfs code already
once before:

http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2011-October/015707.html

The conclusion was that userspace drivers (specifically libdrm device
node detection) stopped relying on procfs in 2001. But after some
digging it turned out that the drmstat tool in libdrm is still using
those files (but only when certain options are set). So we've decided
to keep profcs.

But I when I've started to dig around again what exactly this tool
does I've noticed that it tries to read the "mem", "vm", and "vma"
files from procfs. Now as far my git history digging shows "mem" never
did anything useful (at least in the version that first showed up in
upstream history in 2004) and the file was remove in

    drm: Convert proc files to seq_file and introduce debugfs

Which means that for over 4 years drmstat has been broken, and no one
cared. In my opinion that's proof enough that no one is actually using
drmstat, and so that we can savely nuke the procfs support from drm.

While at it fix up the error case cleanup for debugfs in drm_get_minor.

v2: Fix dates, libdrm stopped relying on procfs for drm node detection
in 2001.

v3: fixup compilation warning for !CONFIG_DEBUG_FS, reported by
Fengguang Wu.
