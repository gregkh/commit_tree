Revert "pl2303: improve the chip type detection/distinction"

This reverts commit 034d1527adebd302115c87ef343497a889638275.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
