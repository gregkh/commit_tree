xhci: quirk for extra long delay for S4

It has been reported that this chipset really cannot
sleep without this extraordinary delay.

This patch should be backported, in order to ensure this host functions
under stable kernels.  The last quirk for Fresco Logic hosts (commit
bba18e33f25072ebf70fd8f7f0cdbf8cdb59a746 "xhci: Extend Fresco Logic MSI
quirk.") was backported to stable kernels as old as 2.6.36.
