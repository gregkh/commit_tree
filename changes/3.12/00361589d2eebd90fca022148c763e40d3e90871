Btrfs: avoid starting a transaction in the write path

I noticed while looking at a deadlock that we are always starting a transaction
in cow_file_range().  This isn't really needed since we only need a transaction
if we are doing an inline extent, or if the allocator needs to allocate a chunk.
So push down all the transaction start stuff to be closer to where we actually
need a transaction in all of these cases.  This will hopefully reduce our write
latency when we are committing often.  Thanks,
