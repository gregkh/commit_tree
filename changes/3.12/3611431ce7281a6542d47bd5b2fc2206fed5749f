i2c: i2c-imx: replace platform_driver_probe to support deferred probing

Subsystems like pinctrl and gpio rightfully make use of deferred probing at
core level. Now, deferred drivers won't be retried if they don't have a .probe
function specified in the driver struct. Fix this driver to have that, so the
devices it supports won't get lost in a deferred probe.
