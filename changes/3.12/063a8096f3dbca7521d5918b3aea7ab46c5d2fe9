NVMe: Restructure MSI / MSI-X setup

The current code copies 'nr_io_queues' into 'q_count', modifies
'nr_io_queues' during MSI-X setup, then resets 'nr_io_queues' for
MSI setup.  Instead, copy 'nr_io_queues' into 'vecs' and modify 'vecs'
during both MSI-X and MSI setup.

This lets us simplify the for-loops that set up MSI-X and MSI, and opens
the possibility of using more I/O queues than we have interrupt vectors,
should future benchmarking prove that to be a useful feature.
