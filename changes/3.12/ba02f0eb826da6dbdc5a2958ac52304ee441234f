tile: improve big-endian support

First, fix a bug in asm/unaligned.h; we need to just use the asm-generic
unaligned.h so we properly choose endian-correct flavors.

Second, keep the hv/hypervisor.h ABI fully "native" in the sense that
we don't have __BIG_ENDIAN__ ifdefs there.  Instead, we use macros in
the head_NN.S assembly code to properly extract two 32-bit structure
members from a 64-bit register holding the structure.
