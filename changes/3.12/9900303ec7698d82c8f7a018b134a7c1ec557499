bgmac: implement unaligned addressing for DMA rings that support it

This is important patch for new devices that support unaligned
addressing. That devices suffer from the backward-compatibility bug in
DMA engine. In theory we should be able to use old mechanism, but in
practice DMA address seems to be randomly copied into status register
when hardware reaches end of a ring. This breaks reading slot number
from status register and we can't use DMA anymore.
