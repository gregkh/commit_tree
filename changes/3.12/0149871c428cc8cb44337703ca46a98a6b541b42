spi: s3c64xx: Do not request CS GPIO on subsequent calls to .setup()

Comments in linux/spi/spi.h and observed behavior show that .setup()
callback can be called multiple times without corresponding calls to
.cleanup(), what was incorrectly assumed by spi-s3c64xx driver, leading
to failures trying to request CS GPIO multiple times.

This patch modifies the behavior of spi-s3c64xx driver to request CS
GPIO only on first call to .setup() after last .cleanup().
