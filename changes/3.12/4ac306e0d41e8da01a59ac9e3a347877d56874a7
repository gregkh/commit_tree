staging: vt6656: baseband.c BBvCalculateParameter pwPhyLen return endian corrected.

In rxtx.c many calls to BBvCaculateParameter are not endian
corrected all calls here need to be endian corrected.

Correct the endian in BBvCaculateParameter.

In card.c: CARDvSetRSPINF pwPhyLen points to awLen and is
manually applied to abyData.  Because it is now endian
corrected put_unaligned is needed to correct it.

In rxtx.c remove were endian is corrected.

This allows to merge  BBvCalculateParameter *pwPhyLen,*pbyPhySrv
and *pbyPhySgn to singles structure for tx buffers.
