drm: remove FASYNC support

So I've stumbled over drm_fasync and wondered what it does. Digging
that up is quite a story.

First I've had to read up on what this does and ended up being rather
bewildered why peopled loved signals so much back in the days that
they've created SIGIO just for that ...

Then I wondered how this ever works, and what that strange "No-op."
comment right above it should mean. After all calling the core fasync
helper is pretty obviously not a noop. After reading through the
kernels FASYNC implementation I've noticed that signals are only sent
out to the processes attached with FASYNC by calling kill_fasync.

No merged drm driver has ever done that.

After more digging I've found out that the only driver that ever used
this is the so called GAMMA driver. I've frankly never heard of such a
gpu brand ever before. Now FASYNC seems to not have been the only bad
thing with that driver, since Dave Airlie removed it from the drm
driver with prejudice:

    Drop GAMMA DRM from a great height ...

Long story short, the drm fasync support seems to be doing absolutely
nothing. And the only user of it was never merged into the upstream
kernel. And we don't need any fops->fasync callback since the fcntl
implementation in the kernel already implements the noop case
correctly.

So stop this particular cargo-cult and rip it all out.

v2: Kill drm_fasync assignments in rcar (newly added) and imx drivers
(somehow I've missed that one in staging). Also drop the reference in
the drm DocBook. ARM compile-fail reported by Rob Clark.

v3: Move the removal of dev->buf_asnyc assignment in drm_setup to this
patch here.

v4: Actually git add ... tsk.
