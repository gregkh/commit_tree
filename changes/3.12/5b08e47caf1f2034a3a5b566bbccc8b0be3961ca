tcp: prefer packet timing to TS-ECR for RTT

Prefer packet timings to TS-ecr for RTT measurements when both
sources are available. That's because broken middle-boxes and remote
peer can return packets with corrupted TS ECR fields. Similarly most
congestion controls that require RTT signals favor timing-based
sources as well. Also check for bad TS ECR values to avoid RTT
blow-ups. It has happened on production Web servers.
