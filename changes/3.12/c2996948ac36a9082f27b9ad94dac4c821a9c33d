PCI: Simplify MPS test for Downstream Port

PCIe hotplug bridges are always either Root Ports or Downstream Ports.  No
other device type can have a PCIe link leading downstream to a slot.

Root Ports don't have an upstream bridge, so "dev->is_hotplug_bridge &&
dev->bus->self" is true if and only if "dev" is a Downstream Port.  That
means we can simplify this by looking at the type of "dev" itself, without
looking upstream at all.

No functional change.
