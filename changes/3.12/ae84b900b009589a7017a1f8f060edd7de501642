video/hdmi: Use hdmi_vendor_infoframe for the HDMI specific infoframe

We just got rid of the version of hdmi_vendor_infoframe that had a byte
array for anyone to poke at. It's now time to shuffle around the naming
of hdmi_hdmi_infoframe to make hdmi_vendor_infoframe become the HDMI
vendor specific structure.
