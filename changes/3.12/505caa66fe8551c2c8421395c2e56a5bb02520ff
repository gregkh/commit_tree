[ this is a follow-up to this discussion:

This patchset renames all uses of "bcm," name bindings to
"brcm," as they were done prior to knowing that brcm had
already been standardized as Broadcom vendor prefix
(in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.txt).
This will not cause any churn on devices because none of
these bindings have made it into production yet.
