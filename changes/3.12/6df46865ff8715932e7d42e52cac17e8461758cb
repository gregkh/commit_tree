mm: vmstats: track TLB flush stats on UP too

The previous patch doing vmstats for TLB flushes ("mm: vmstats: tlb flush
counters") effectively missed UP since arch/x86/mm/tlb.c is only compiled
for SMP.

UP systems do not do remote TLB flushes, so compile those counters out on
UP.

arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/generic.c calls __flush_tlb() directly.  This is
probably an optimization since both the mtrr code and __flush_tlb() write
cr4.  It would probably be safe to make that a flush_tlb_all() (and then
get these statistics), but the mtrr code is ancient and I'm hesitant to
touch it other than to just stick in the counters.
