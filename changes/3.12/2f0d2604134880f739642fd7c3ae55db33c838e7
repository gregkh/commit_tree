Input: i8042 - i8042_flush fix for a full 8042 buffer

When 8042 internal data buffer is full, the driver
erroneously decides that the controller is not present.

i8042_flush returns the number of flushed bytes, which is
in 0 - I8042_BUFFER_SIZE range inclusive. Therefore, i8042_flush
has no way to indicate an error. Moreover i8042_controller_check
takes initially full buffer (i8042_flush returned
I8042_BUFFER_SIZE) as a sign of absence of the controller.

Let's change i8042 to return success/error instead and make sure
we do not return error prematurely.
