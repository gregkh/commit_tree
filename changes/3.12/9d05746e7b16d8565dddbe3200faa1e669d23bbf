vfs: allow O_PATH file descriptors for fstatfs()

Olga reported that file descriptors opened with O_PATH do not work with
fstatfs(), found during further development of ksh93's thread support.

There is no reason to not allow O_PATH file descriptors here (fstatfs is
very much a path operation), so use "fdget_raw()".  See commit
55815f70147d ("vfs: make O_PATH file descriptors usable for 'fstat()'")
for a very similar issue reported for fstat() by the same team.
