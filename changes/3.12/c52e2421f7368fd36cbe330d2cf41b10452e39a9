tcp: must unclone packets before mangling them

TCP stack should make sure it owns skbs before mangling them.

We had various crashes using bnx2x, and it turned out gso_size
was cleared right before bnx2x driver was populating TC descriptor
of the _previous_ packet send. TCP stack can sometime retransmit
packets that are still in Qdisc.

Of course we could make bnx2x driver more robust (using
ACCESS_ONCE(shinfo->gso_size) for example), but the bug is TCP stack.

We have identified two points where skb_unclone() was needed.

This patch adds a WARN_ON_ONCE() to warn us if we missed another
fix of this kind.

Kudos to Neal for finding the root cause of this bug. Its visible
using small MSS.
