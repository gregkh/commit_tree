ASoC: imx-mc13783: Make SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783 visible again

Commit 02502da45 (ASoC: imx-mc13783: Depend on ARCH_ARM) introduced 'ARCH_ARM'
as a dependency for SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783, but this is a non-existent symbol.

This makes the selection of SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783 to be impossible.

Use the correct 'ARM' symbol instead.
