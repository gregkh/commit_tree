staging: ozwpan: Create deferred work to destroy PD object.

Currently we call oz_pd_destroy() from softirq context, where we
try to destroy relevant data structures, as well we kill a tasklet
which always result in following kernel warning.

[12279.262194] Attempt to kill tasklet from interrupt
[12279.262202] Attempt to kill tasklet from interrupt

This patch defers deallocation of data structures to work queue.
