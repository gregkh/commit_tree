rcu: Increase rcutorture test coverage

Currently, rcutorture has separate torture_types to test synchronous,
asynchronous, and expedited grace-period primitives.  This has
two disadvantages: (1) Three times the number of runs to cover the
combinations and (2) Little testing of concurrent combinations of the
three options.  This commit therefore adds a pair of module parameters
that control normal and expedited state, with the default being both
types, randomly selected, by the fakewriter processes, thus reducing
source-code size and increasing test coverage.  In addtion, the writer
task switches between asynchronous-normal and expedited grace-period
primitives driven by the same pair of module parameters.
