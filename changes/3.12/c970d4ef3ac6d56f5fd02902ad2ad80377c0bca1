ARM: shmobile: Introduce shared SCU SMP boot code

Add SMP boot functions for SCU equipped mach-shmobile SoCs.

At this point shmobile_smp_scu_prepare_cpus() controls the SCU and
installs boot fn and arg, while shmobile_smp_scu_boot_secondary()
currently does nothing. In the future the boot function and arg
install code will be reworked, so the empty function is ground
work for that.
