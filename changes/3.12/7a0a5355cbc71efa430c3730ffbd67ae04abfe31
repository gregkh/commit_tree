md: Don't test all of mddev->flags at once.

mddev->flags is mostly used to record if an update of the
metadata is needed.  Sometimes the whole field is tested
instead of just the important bits.  This makes it difficult
to introduce more state bits.

So replace all bare tests of mddev->flags with tests for the bits
that actually need testing.
