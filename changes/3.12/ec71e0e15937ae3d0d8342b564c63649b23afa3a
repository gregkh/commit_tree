cifs: convert case-insensitive dentry ops to use new case conversion routines

Have the case-insensitive d_compare and d_hash routines convert each
character in the filenames to wchar_t's and then use the new
cifs_toupper routine to convert those into uppercase.

With this scheme we should more closely emulate the case conversion that
the servers will do.
