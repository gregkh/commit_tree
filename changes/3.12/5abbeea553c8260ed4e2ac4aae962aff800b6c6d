can: at91-can: fix device to driver data mapping for platform devices

In commit:

    3078cde7 can: at91_can: add dt support

device tree support was added to the at91_can driver. In this commit the
mapping of device to driver data was mixed up. This results in the sam9x5
parameters being used for the sam9263 and the workaround for the broken mailbox
0 on the sam9263 not being activated.

This patch fixes the broken platform_device_id table.
