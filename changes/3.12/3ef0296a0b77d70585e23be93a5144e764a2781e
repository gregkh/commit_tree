xen/events: document behaviour when scanning the start word for events

The original comment on the scanning of the start word on the 2nd pass
did not reflect the actual behaviour (the code was incorrectly masking
bit_idx instead of the pending word itself).

The documented behaviour is not actually required since if event were
pending in the MSBs, they would be immediately scanned anyway as we go
through the loop again.

Update the documentation to reflect this (instead of trying to change
the behaviour).
