xhci: remove CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD_DEBUGGING and unused code

CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD_DEBUGGING option is used to enable
verbose debugging output for the xHCI host controller
driver.

In the current version of the xhci-hcd driver, this
option must be turned on, in order for the debugging
log messages to be displayed, and users may need to
recompile the linux kernel to obtain debugging
information that will help them track down problems.

This patch removes the above debug option to enable
debugging log messages at all times.
The aim of this is to rely on the debugfs and the
dynamic debugging feature for fine-grained management
of debugging messages and to not force users to set
the debug config option and compile the linux kernel
in order to have access in that information.

This patch, also, removes the XHCI_DEBUG symbol and the
functions dma_to_stream_ring(), xhci_test_radix_tree()
and xhci_event_ring_work() that are not useful anymore.
