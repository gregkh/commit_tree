serial: imx: remove the uart_console() check

The uart_console() check makes the clocks(clk_per and clk_ipg) opened
even when we close the console uart.

This patch enable/disable the clocks in imx_console_write(),
so we can keep the clocks closed when the console uart is closed.

Also remove the clock enable/disable oprations in the probe, we do not
need them any more.
