tile: fix some issues in hugepage support

First, in huge_pte_offset(), we were erroneously checking
pgd_present(), which is always true, rather than pud_present(),
which is the thing that tells us if there is a top-level (L0) PTE.
Fixing this means we properly look up huge page entries only when
the Present bit is actually set in the PTE.

Second, use the standard pte_alloc_map() instead of the hand-rolled
pte_alloc_hugetlb() routine that basically was written to avoid
worrying about CONFIG_HIGHPTE.  However, we no longer plan to support
HIGHPTE, so a separate routine was just unnecessary code duplication.
