staging/lustre/ldlm: Fix flock deadlock detection race

Deadlock isn't detected if 2 threads are trying to
grant 2 locks which deadlock on each other.
They call ldlm_flock_deadlock() simultaneously
and deadlock ins't detected.

The soulition is to add lock to blocking list before
calling ldlm_flock_deadlock()
