tile: optimize and clean up string functions

This change cleans up the string code in a number of ways:

- For memcpy(), fix bug in prefetch and increase distance to 3 lines;
  optimize for unaligned data; do all loads before wh64 to make memcpy
  safe for forward-overlapping calls; etc.  Performance is improved.

- Use new copy_byte() function on tilegx to spread a single byte value
  out into a full word using the shufflebytes instruction.

- Clean up header include ordering to be more canonical, and remove
  spurious #undefs of function names.
