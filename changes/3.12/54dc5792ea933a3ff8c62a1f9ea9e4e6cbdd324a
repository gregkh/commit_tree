Revert "USB: pl2303: restrict the divisor based baud rate encoding method to the "HX" chip type"

This reverts commit b8bdad608213caffa081a97d2e937e5fe08c4046.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
