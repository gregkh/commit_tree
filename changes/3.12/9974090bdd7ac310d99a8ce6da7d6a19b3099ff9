Btrfs: batch the extent state operation when reading pages

In the past, we cached the checksum value in the extent state object, so we
had to split the extent state object by the block size, or we had no space
to keep this checksum value. But it increased the lock contention of the
extent state tree.

Now we removed this limit by caching the checksum into the bio object, so
it is unnecessary to do the extent state operations by the block size, we
can do it in batches, in this way, we can reduce the lock contention of
the extent state tree.
