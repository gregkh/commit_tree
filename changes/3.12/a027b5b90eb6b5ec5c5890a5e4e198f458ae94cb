[SCSI] scsi_debug: fix logical block provisioning support when unmap_alignment != 0

Commit b90ebc3d5c41c9164ae04efd2e4f8204c2a186f1 ("[SCSI] scsi_debug:
fix logical block provisioning support") fixed several issues with
logical block provisioning support, but it still doesn't properly fix
the cases when unmap_alignment > 0.

For example, load scsi_debug module with the following module parameters
and make all blocks mapped by filling the storage with zero.

        # modprobe scsi_debug lbpu=1 unmap_alignment=1 unmap_granularity=4
        # dd if=/dev/zero of=$DEV

Then, try to unmap the first unmappable blocks at lba=1, but GET LBA STATUS
unexpectedly reports that the last UNMAP has done nothing.

        # sg_unmap --lba=1 --num=4 $DEV
        # sg_get_lba_status --lba=1 $DEV
        descriptor LBA: 0x0000000000000001  blocks: 16383  mapped

The problem is in map_index_to_lba(), which should return the first
LBA which is corresponding to a given index of provisioning map
(map_storep).
