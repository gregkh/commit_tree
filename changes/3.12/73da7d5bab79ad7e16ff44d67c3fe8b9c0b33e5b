mac80211: add channel switch command and beacon callbacks

The count field in CSA must be decremented with each beacon
transmitted. This patch implements the functionality for drivers
using ieee80211_beacon_get(). Other drivers must call back manually
after reaching count == 0.

This patch also contains the handling and finish worker for the channel
switch command, and mac80211/chanctx code to allow to change a channel
definition of an active channel context.
