usb: musb dma: add cppi41 dma driver

This driver is currently used by musb' cppi41 couter part. I may merge
both dma engine user of musb at some point but not just yet.

The driver seems to work in RX/TX mode in host mode, tested on mass
storage. I increaed the size of the TX / RX transfers and waited for the
core code to cancel a transfers and it seems to recover.

v2..3:
- use mall transfers on RX side and check data toggle.
- use rndis mode on tx side so we haveon interrupt for 4096 transfers.
- remove custom "transferred" hack and use dmaengine_tx_status() to
  compute the total amount of data that has been transferred.
- cancel transfers and reclaim descriptors

v1..v2:
- RX path added
- dma mode 0 & 1 is working
- device tree nodes re-created.
