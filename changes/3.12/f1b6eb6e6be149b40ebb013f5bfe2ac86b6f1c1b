mm/sl[aou]b: Move kmallocXXX functions to common code

The kmalloc* functions of all slab allcoators are similar now so
lets move them into slab.h. This requires some function naming changes
in slob.

As a results of this patch there is a common set of functions for
all allocators. Also means that kmalloc_large() is now available
in general to perform large order allocations that go directly
via the page allocator. kmalloc_large() can be substituted if
kmalloc() throws warnings because of too large allocations.

kmalloc_large() has exactly the same semantics as kmalloc but
can only used for allocations > PAGE_SIZE.
