ARM: barrier: allow options to be passed to memory barrier instructions

On ARMv7, the memory barrier instructions take an optional `option'
field which can be used to constrain the effects of a memory barrier
based on shareability and access type.

This patch allows the caller to pass these options if required, and
updates the smp_*() barriers to request inner-shareable barriers,
affecting only stores for the _wmb variant. wmb() is also changed to
use the -st version of dsb.
