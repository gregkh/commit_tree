drm/i915: disable CLKOUT_DP when it's not needed

We currently don't support HDMI clock bending nor use SSC for DP or
HDMI on Haswell, so the only case where we need CLKOUT_DP is for VGA.

v2: - Replace the IS_ULT check for LPT-LP
    - Simplify GEN0/DBUFF0 check due to change on the previous patch
    - Also check for SBI_SSCCTL_DISABLE (Ben).
