cpufreq: Introduce a flag ('frozen') to separate full vs temporary init/teardown

During suspend/resume we would like to do a light-weight init/teardown of
CPUs in the cpufreq subsystem and preserve certain things such as sysfs files
etc across suspend/resume transitions. Add a flag called 'frozen' to help
distinguish the full init/teardown sequence from the light-weight one.
