usb: config->desc.bLength may not exceed amount of data returned by the device

While reading the config parsing code I noticed this check is missing, without
this check config->desc.wTotalLength can end up with a value larger then the
dev->rawdescriptors length for the config, and when userspace then tries to
get the rawdescriptors bad things may happen.
