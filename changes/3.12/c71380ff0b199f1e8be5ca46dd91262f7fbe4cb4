netconsole: fix a deadlock with rtnl and netconsole's mutex

This bug was introduced by commit
7a163bfb7ce50895bbe67300ea610d31b9c09230 ("netconsole: avoid a crash with
multiple sysfs writers"). In store_enabled() we have the following
sequence: acquire nt->mutex then rtnl, but in the netconsole netdev
notifier we have rtnl then nt->mutex effectively leading to a deadlock.
The NULL pointer dereference that the above commit tries to fix is
actually due to another bug in netpoll_cleanup(). This is fixed by dropping
the mutex from the netdev notifier as it's already protected by rtnl.
