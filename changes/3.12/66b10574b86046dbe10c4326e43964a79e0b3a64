MIPS: Fix invalid symbolic link file

Commit 3b29aa5ba204c [MIPS: add <dt-bindings/> symlink] created a symlink
file in include/dt-bindings.  Even though commit diff is fine, the symlink
is invalid and ls -lb shows a newline character at the end of the filename:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 maddy maddy 35 Sep 19 18:11 dt-bindings ->
../../../../../include/dt-bindings\n
