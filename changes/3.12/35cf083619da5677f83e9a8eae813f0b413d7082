cgroup: rename cgroup_css_from_dir() to css_from_dir() and update its syntax

cgroup_css_from_dir() will grow another user.  In preparation, make
the following changes.

* All css functions are prefixed with just "css_", rename it to
  css_from_dir().

* Take dentry * instead of file * as dentry is what ultimately
  identifies a cgroup and file may not always be available.  Note that
  the function now checkes whether @dentry->d_inode is NULL as the
  caller now may specify a negative dentry.

* Make it take cgroup_subsys * instead of integer subsys_id.  This
  simplifies the function and allows specifying no subsystem for
  cgroup->dummy_css.

* Make return section a bit less verbose.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.
