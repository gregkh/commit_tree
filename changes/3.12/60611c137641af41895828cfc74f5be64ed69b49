drm/i915: don't queue PM events we won't process

On SNB/IVB/VLV we only call gen6_rps_irq_handler if one of the IIR
bits set is part of GEN6_PM_RPS_EVENTS, but at gen6_rps_irq_handler we
add all the enabled IIR bits to the work queue, not only the ones that
are part of GEN6_PM_RPS_EVENTS. But then gen6_pm_rps_work only
processes GEN6_PM_RPS_EVENTS, so it's useless to add anything that's
not GEN6_PM_RPS_EVENTS to the work queue.

As a bonus, gen6_rps_irq_handler looks more similar to
hsw_pm_irq_handler, so we may be able to merge them in the future.

v2: - Add a WARN in case we queued something we're not going to
      process.
