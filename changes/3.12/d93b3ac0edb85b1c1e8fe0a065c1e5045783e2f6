VFIO: vfio_iommu_type1: fix bug caused by break in nested loop

In vfio_iommu_type1.c there is a bug in vfio_dma_do_map, when checking
that pages are not already mapped. Since the check is being done in a
for loop nested within the main loop, breaking out of it does not create
the intended behavior. If the underlying IOMMU driver returns a non-NULL
value, this will be ignored and mapping the DMA range will be attempted
anyway, leading to unpredictable behavior.

This interracts badly with the ARM SMMU driver issue fixed in the patch
that was submitted with the title:
"[PATCH 2/2] ARM: SMMU: return NULL on error in arm_smmu_iova_to_phys"
Both fixes are required in order to use the vfio_iommu_type1 driver
with an ARM SMMU.

This patch refactors the function slightly, in order to also make this
kind of bug less likely.
