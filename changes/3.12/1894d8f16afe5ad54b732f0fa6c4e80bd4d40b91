NVMe: Use normal shutdown

The NVMe spec recommends using the shutdown normal sequence when safely
taking the controller offline instead of hitting CC.EN on the next
start-up to reset the controller. The spec recommends a minimum of 1
second for the shutdown complete. This patch waits 2 seconds to be on
the safe side.
