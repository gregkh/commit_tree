ALSA: hda - Haswell codec exposes device list/select info on pins

This patch is only to allow codec proc file to expose devices list/select info
for Haswell codec pins.

Since Haswell Gfx driver cannot support DP1.2 MST now, so all pins' device list
is empty, meaning no pin is multi-streaming capaple.
