Btrfs: add the missing mutex unlock in write_all_supers()

The BUG() was replaced by btrfs_error() and return -EIO with the
patch "get rid of one BUG() in write_all_supers()", but the missing
mutex_unlock() was overlooked.

The 0-DAY kernel build service from Intel reported the missing
unlock which was found by the coccinelle tool:

    fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:3422:2-8: preceding lock on line 3374
