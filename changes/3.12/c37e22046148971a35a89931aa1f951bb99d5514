drm/i915: Add VM to pin

To verbalize it, one can say, "pin an object into the given address
space." The semantics of pinning remain the same otherwise.

Certain objects will always have to be bound into the global GTT.
Therefore, global GTT is a special case, and keep a special interface
around for it (i915_gem_obj_ggtt_pin).
