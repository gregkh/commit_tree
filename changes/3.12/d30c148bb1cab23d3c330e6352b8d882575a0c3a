ASoC: smdk_wm8994: Configure the MCLK1 rate based on the board

Make the code more generally applicable by refactoring so that the MCLK1
rate can be selected based on the compatible string provided by the device
tree, allowing use on other boards which have different rates or use other
information sources.
