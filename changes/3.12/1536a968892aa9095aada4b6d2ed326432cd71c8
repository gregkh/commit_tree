ASoC: add Renesas R-Car core feature

Renesas R-Car series sound circuit consists of SSI and its peripheral.
But this peripheral circuits are different between
R-Car Generation1 (E1/M1/H1) and Generation2 (E2/M2/H2).
(Actually, there are many difference in Generation1 chips)

Basically, for the future, Renesas R-Car series will use
Gen2 style sound circuit, but driver should care Gen1 also.
The main differences between Gen1 and Gen2 peripheral
are 1) register offset, 2) data path.

This patch adds basic (core) feature for R-Car
series sound driver as prototype
