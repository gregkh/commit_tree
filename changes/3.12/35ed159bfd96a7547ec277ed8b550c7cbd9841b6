virtio-net: refill only when device is up during setting queues

We used to schedule the refill work unconditionally after changing the
number of queues. This may lead an issue if the device is not
up. Since we only try to cancel the work in ndo_stop(), this may cause
the refill work still work after removing the device. Fix this by only
schedule the work when device is up.

The bug were introduce by commit 9b9cd8024a2882e896c65222aa421d461354e3f2.
