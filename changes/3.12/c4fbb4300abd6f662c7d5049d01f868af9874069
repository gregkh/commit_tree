Btrfs: fix worst case calculator for space usage

Forever ago I made the worst case calculator say that we could potentially split
into 3 blocks for every level on the way down, which isn't right.  If we split
we're only going to get two new blocks, the one we originally cow'ed and the new
one we're going to split.  Thanks,
