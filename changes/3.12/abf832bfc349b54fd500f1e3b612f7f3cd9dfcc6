HID: trivial devm conversion for special hid drivers

It is safe to use devres allocation within the hid subsystem:
- the devres release is called _after_ the call to .remove(), meaning
  that no freed pointers will exists while removing the device
- if a .probe() fails, devres releases all the allocated ressources
  before going to the next driver: there will not be ghost ressources
  attached to a hid device if several drivers are probed.

Given that, we can clean up a little some of the HID drivers. These ones
are trivial:
- there is only one kzalloc in the driver
- the .remove() callback contains only one kfree on top of hid_hw_stop()
- the error path in the probe is easy enough to be manually checked
