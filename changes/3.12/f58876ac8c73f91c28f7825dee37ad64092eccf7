hwmon: (nct6775) Fix size of data->temp array

Smatch complains that we have a array overflow:

	drivers/hwmon/nct6775.c:1456 nct6775_update_device()
		error: buffer overflow 'data->temp' 4 <= 4

Guenter Roeck says that the array should have been made larger in
7cbbd6aee6 (Add support for critical low/high temperature limits on
NCT6106).  This patch does that.
