net: mv643xx_eth: fix orphaned statistics timer crash

The periodic statistics timer gets started at port _probe() time, but
is stopped on _stop() only. In a modular environment, this can cause
the timer to access already deallocated memory, if the module is unloaded
without starting the eth device. To fix this, we add the timer right
before the port is started, instead of at _probe() time.
