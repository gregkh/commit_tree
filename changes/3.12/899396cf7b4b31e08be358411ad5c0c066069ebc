perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add auxiliary pci device support

The QPI uncore boxes have two pairs of MATCH/MASK registers that
user to filter packet traffic serviced by QPI link layer. These
registers are in auxiliary PCI devices.

This patch changes the meaning of (struct pci_device_id)->driver_data.
The first 8 bits are device index of the same uncore type, the second
8 bytes are uncore type index. Auxiliary PCI device's type is defined
as UNCORE_EXTRA_PCI_DEV(0xff)
