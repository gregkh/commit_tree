cpufreq: Split __cpufreq_remove_dev() into two parts

During CPU offline, the cpufreq core invokes __cpufreq_remove_dev()
to perform work such as stopping the cpufreq governor, clearing the
CPU from the policy structure etc, and finally cleaning up the
kobject.

There are certain subtle issues related to the kobject cleanup, and
it would be much easier to deal with them if we separate that part
from the rest of the cleanup-work in the CPU offline phase. So split
the __cpufreq_remove_dev() function into 2 parts: one that handles
the kobject cleanup, and the other that handles the rest of the work.
