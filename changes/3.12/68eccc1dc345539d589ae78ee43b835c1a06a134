ipc,shm: introduce shmctl_nolock

Similar to semctl and msgctl, when calling msgctl, the *_INFO and *_STAT
commands can be performed without acquiring the ipc object.

Add a shmctl_nolock() function and move the logic of *_INFO and *_STAT out
of msgctl().  Since we are just moving functionality, this change still
takes the lock and it will be properly lockless in the next patch.
