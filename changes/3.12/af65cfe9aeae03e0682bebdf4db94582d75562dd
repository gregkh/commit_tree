ACPI / LPSS: don't crash if a device has no MMIO resources

Intel LPSS devices that are enumerated from ACPI have both MMIO and IRQ
resources returned in their _CRS method. However, Apple Macbook Air with
Haswell has LPSS devices enumerated from PCI bus instead and _CRS method
returns only an interrupt number (but the device has _HID set that causes
the scan handler to match it).

The current ACPI / LPSS code sets pdata->dev_desc only when MMIO resource
is found for the device and in case of Macbook Air it is never found. That
leads to a NULL pointer dereference in register_device_clock().

Correct this by always setting the pdata->dev_desc.
