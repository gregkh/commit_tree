usb: usb_phy_gen: refine conditional declaration of usb_nop_xceiv_register

Commit 3fa4d734 (usb: phy: rename nop_usb_xceiv => usb_phy_gen_xceiv)
changed the conditional around the declaration of usb_nop_xceiv_register
from
	#if defined(CONFIG_NOP_USB_XCEIV) ||
		(defined(CONFIG_NOP_USB_XCEIV_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
to
	#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NOP_USB_XCEIV)

While that looks the same, it is semantically different. The first expression
is true if CONFIG_NOP_USB_XCEIV is built as module and if the including
code is built as module. The second expression is true if code depending on
CONFIG_NOP_USB_XCEIV if built as module or into the kernel.

As a result, the arm:allmodconfig build fails with

arch/arm/mach-omap2/built-in.o: In function `omap3_evm_init':
arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap3evm.c:703: undefined reference to
	`usb_nop_xceiv_register'

Fix the problem by reverting to the old conditional.
