staging: cxt1e1: Remove #define SBE_INCLUDE_SYMBOLS

Removed the unneeded SBE_INCLUDE_SYMBOLS #define, and the associated STATIC
#define, and replaced all occurances of STATIC with 'static'.  This was in
response to sparse warnings of the form "symbol 'XYZ' was not declared. Should
it be static?".

Removed a function prototype (musycc_init_port) as adding the 'static'
declaration produced a new gcc warning. (musycc_init_port is only declared if
SBE_WAN256T3_ENABLE is set)
