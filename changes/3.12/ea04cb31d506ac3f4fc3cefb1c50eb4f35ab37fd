drm/i915: drop unnecessary local variable to suppress build warning

Although I could not reproduce this (different compiler version,
perhaps), reportedly we get:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_irq.c:1943:27: warning: ‘score’ may be used
uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]

Drop the 'score' variable altogether as it's not really needed.
