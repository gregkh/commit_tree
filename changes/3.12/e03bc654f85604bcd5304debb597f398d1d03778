mv_xor: support big endian systems using descriptor swap feature

The mv_xor driver had never been used in a big-endian context, and
therefore was not using the hardware features to support such an
execution environment. The hardware provides a "descriptor swap" bit
that automatically swaps the bytes of the DMA descriptors, within
blocks of 8 bytes. This requires a different DMA descriptor layout on
big-endian systems, as well as enabling this "descriptor swap" bit.

This mechanism is exactly identical to the one already used in the
mv643xx_eth network driver and the mvneta network driver.
