drm/i915: check the power well when redisabling VGA

If the power well is disabled VGA is guaranteed to be disabled.

This fixes unclaimed register messages that happen on suspend/resume.

v2: Check the actual hw power well state instead of our own tracking
to make sure VGA is _really_ off (in case the BIOS/KVMr has just its
own request bit set). Requested by Ville.

Note: Ville suggested whether it wouldn't be better to just enable the
power well over a slightly longer time in our resume code, since we
already do that. I tend to agree, but there's also the modeset force
code in the lid notifier which _also_ eventually calls redisable_vga.
We shouldn't ever need this on somewhat modern hw (everything with
opregion essentially) but the code to bail out isn't there. Hence
stick with this simple approach here for now.
