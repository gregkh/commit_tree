rt2x00: rt2800lib: fix LNA_A[12] gain values for RT3593

The LNA_A[12] gain values are stored at a different
offset in the EEPROM on RT3593 based devices. However
the current code unconditionally reads those values
from the location used by other chipsets.

Fix the code to use the correct EEPROM offset.

Based on the DPO_RT5572_LinuxSTA_2.6.0.1_20120629
driver.
