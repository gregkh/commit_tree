KVM: nVMX: Fix read/write to MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL

Fix read/write to IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL MSR in nested environment.

This patch simulate this MSR in nested_vmx and the default value is
0x0. BIOS should set it to 0x5 before VMXON. After setting the lock
bit, write to it will cause #GP(0).

Another QEMU patch is also needed to handle emulation of reset
and migration. Reset to vCPU should clear this MSR and migration
should reserve value of it.

This patch is based on Nadav's previous commit.
