drm/i915: don't disable/reenable IVB error interrupts when not needed

If the error interrupts are already disabled, don't disable and
reenable them. This is going to be needed when we're in PC8+, where
all the interrupts are disabled so we won't risk re-enabling
DE_ERR_INT_IVB.

v2: Use dev_priv->irq_mask (Chris)
