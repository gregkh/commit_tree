ARM: ux500: fix devicetree builds

The patch set beginning with commit:
"ARM: ux500: Apply a ste-* prefix onto snowball.dts"
thru commit:
"ARM: ux500: Remove u9540.dts as it's been replaced"
altered the names of the ux500 device tree files but forgot
to:

- Rename the ccu8540-pinctrl.dtsi file

- Update #include statements from files using these
  files, so the build broke.

- Update the Makefile for the device trees so the build
  broke.

Fix it up so we can build them all again.
