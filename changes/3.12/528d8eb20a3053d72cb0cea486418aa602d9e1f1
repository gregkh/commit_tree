parisc: kill SMP single function call interrupt

Commit 9a46ad6d6df3b54 "smp: make smp_call_function_many() use logic
similar to smp_call_function_single()" has unified the way to handle
single and multiple cross-CPU function calls. Now only one interrupt
is needed for architecture specific code to support generic SMP function
call interfaces, so kill the redundant single function call interrupt.
