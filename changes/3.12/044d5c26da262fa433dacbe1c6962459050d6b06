Thermal/cpu_cooling: Return directly for the cpu out of allowed_cpus in the cpufreq_thermal_notifier()

cpufreq_thermal_notifier() is to change the cpu's cpufreq in the allowed_cpus mask
when associated thermal-cpufreq cdev's cooling state is changed. It's a cpufreq policy
notifier handler and it will be triggered even if those cpus out of allowed_cpus has
changed freq policy.

cpufreq_thermal_notifier() checks the policy->cpu. If it belongs to allowed_cpus,
change max_freq(default to 0) to the desire cpufreq value and pass 0 and max_freq
to cpufreq_verify_within_limits() as cpufreq scope. But if not, do nothing and
max_freq will remain 0. This will cause the cpufreq scope to become 0~0. This
is not right. This patch is to return directly after finding cpu not belonging
to allowed_cpus.
