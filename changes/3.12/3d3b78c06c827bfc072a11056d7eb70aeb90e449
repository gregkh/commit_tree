drm: allow DRM_IOCTL_VERSION on render-nodes

DRM_IOCTL_VERSION is a reliable way to get the driver-name and version
information. It's not related to the interface-version (SET_VERSION ioctl)
so we can safely enable it on render-nodes.

Note that gbm uses udev-BUSID to load the correct mesa driver. However,
the VERSION ioctl should be the more reliable way to do this (in case we
add new DRM-bus drivers which have no BUSID or similar).
