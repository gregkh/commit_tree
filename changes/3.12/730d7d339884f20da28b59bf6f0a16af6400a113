sysfs: Allow mounting without CONFIG_NET

In kobj_ns_current_may_mount the default should be to allow the mount.
The test is only for a single kobj_ns_type at a time, and unless there
is a reason to prevent it the mounting sysfs should be allowed.
Subsystems that are not registered can't have are not involved so can't
have a reason to prevent mounting sysfs.

This is a bug-fix to commit 7dc5dbc879bd ("sysfs: Restrict mounting
sysfs") that came in via the userns tree during the 3.12 merge window.
