ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Do not queue up event handling work items in vain

Modify handle_hotplug_event() to avoid queing up the execution of
handle_hotplug_event_work_fn() as a work item on kacpi_hotplug_wq
for non-hotplug events, such as ACPI_NOTIFY_DEVICE_WAKE.  Move
the code printing diagnostic messages for those events into
handle_hotplug_event().

In addition to that, remove the bogus comment about how the core
should distinguish between hotplug and non-hotplug events and
queue them up on different workqueues.  The core clearly cannot
know in advance what events will be interesting to the given
caller of acpi_install_notify_handler().
