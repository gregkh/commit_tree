ACPICA: Fix divergences of the commit - ACPICA: Expose OSI version.

The original commit 242b2287cd7f27521c8b54a4101d569e53e7a0ca "ACPICA:
expose OSI version" triggers build errors in ACPICA when it is back
ported.  The patch removes the divergences between Linux and upstream
ACPICA resulting from that.
