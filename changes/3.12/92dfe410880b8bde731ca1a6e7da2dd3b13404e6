Revert "usb: pl2303: increase the allowed baud rate range for the divisor based encoding method"

This reverts commit b5c16c6a031c52cc4b7dda6c3de46462fbc92eab.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
