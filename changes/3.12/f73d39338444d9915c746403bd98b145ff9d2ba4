cpufreq: don't allow governor limits to be changed when it is disabled

__cpufreq_governor() returns with -EBUSY when governor is already
stopped and we try to stop it again, but when it is stopped we must
not allow calls to CPUFREQ_GOV_LIMITS event as well.

This patch adds this check in __cpufreq_governor().
