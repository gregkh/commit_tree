usb: common: introduce of_usb_get_maximum_speed()

this helper will be used for controllers which
want to work at a lower speed even though they
support higher USB transfer rates.

One such case is Texas Instruments' AM437x
SoC where it uses a USB3 controller without
a USB3 PHY, rendering the controller USB2-only.
