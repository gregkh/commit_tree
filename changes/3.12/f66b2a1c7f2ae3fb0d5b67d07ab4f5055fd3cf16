[media] cx88: Fix regression: CX88_AUDIO_WM8775 can't be 0

Cards using the wm8775 specify that in their card struct. Those that do not
use it leave the audio_chip field to 0. Unfortunately, the CX88_AUDIO_WM8775
enum is 0 as well, so boards that do not have the wm8775 still try to load
and use that driver. Change it to 1 to fix this.
This regression was introduced in commit facd23664f1d63c33fbc6da52261c8548ed3fbd4.
