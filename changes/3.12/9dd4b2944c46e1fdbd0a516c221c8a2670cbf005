ARM: xen: only set pm function ptrs for Xen guests

xen_pm_init was unconditionally setting pm_power_off and arm_pm_restart
function pointers. This breaks multi-platform kernels. Make this
conditional on running as a Xen guest and make it a late_initcall to
ensure it is setup after platform code for Dom0.
