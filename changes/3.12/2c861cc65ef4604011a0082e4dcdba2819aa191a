ipv6: don't call fib6_run_gc() until routing is ready

When loading the ipv6 module, ndisc_init() is called before
ip6_route_init(). As the former registers a handler calling
fib6_run_gc(), this opens a window to run the garbage collector
before necessary data structures are initialized. If a network
device is initialized in this window, adding MAC address to it
triggers a NETDEV_CHANGEADDR event, leading to a crash in
fib6_clean_all().

Take the event handler registration out of ndisc_init() into a
separate function ndisc_late_init() and move it after
ip6_route_init().
