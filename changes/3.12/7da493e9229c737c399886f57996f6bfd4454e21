ASoC: Samsung: I2S: Add quirks as driver data in I2S

Samsung has different versions of I2S introduced in different
platforms. Each version has some new support added for multichannel,
secondary fifo, s/w reset control and internal mux for rclk src clk.
Each newly added change has a quirk. So this patch adds all the
required quirks as driver data and based on compatible string from
dtsi fetches the quirks.
