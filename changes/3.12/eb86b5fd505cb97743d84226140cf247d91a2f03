x86/asmlinkage: Fix warning in xen asmlinkage change

Current code uses asmlinkage for functions without arguments.
This adds an implicit regparm(0) which creates a warning
when assigning the function to pointers.

Use __visible for the functions without arguments.
This avoids having to add regparm(0) to function pointers.
Since they have no arguments it does not make any difference.
