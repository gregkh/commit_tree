cifs: Avoid umount hangs with smb2 when server is unresponsive

Do not send SMB2 Logoff command when reconnecting, the way smb1
code base works.

Also, no need to wait for a credit for an echo command when one is already
in flight.

Without these changes, umount command hangs if the server is unresponsive
e.g. hibernating.
