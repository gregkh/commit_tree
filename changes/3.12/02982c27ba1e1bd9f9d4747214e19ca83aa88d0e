netfilter: nf_conntrack: remove duplicate code in ctnetlink

ctnetlink contains copy-paste code from death_by_timeout.  In order to
avoid changing both places in upcoming event delivery patch,
export death_by_timeout functionality and use it in the ctnetlink code.

Based on earlier patch from Pablo Neira.
