ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Hotplug context objects for bridges and functions

When either a new hotplug bridge or a new hotplug function is added
by the ACPI-based PCI hotplug (ACPIPHP) code, attach a context object
to its ACPI handle to store hotplug-related information in it.  To
start with, put the handle's bridge and function pointers into that
object.  Count references to the context objects and drop them when
they are not needed any more.

First of all, this makes it possible to find out if the given bridge
has been registered as a function already in a much more
straightforward way and acpiphp_bridge_handle_to_function() can be
dropped (Yay!).

This also will allow some more simplifications to be made going
forward.
