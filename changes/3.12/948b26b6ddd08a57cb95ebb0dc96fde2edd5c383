perf: Account freq events globally

Freq events may not always be affine to a particular CPU. As such,
account_event_cpu() may crash if we account per cpu a freq event
that has event->cpu == -1.

To solve this, lets account freq events globally. In practice
this doesn't change much the picture because perf tools create
per-task perf events with one event per CPU by default. Profiling a
single CPU is usually a corner case so there is no much point in
optimizing things that way.
