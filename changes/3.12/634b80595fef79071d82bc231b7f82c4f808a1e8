rt2x00: rt2800lib: don't hardcode beacon offsets

The values written into the BCN_OFFSET[01] registers are
hardcoded in the rt2800_init_register function.

Add a macro and a helper function to derive these values
directly from the base address of a given beacon, and use
the new function instead of the hardcoded numbers.

The patch contains no functional changes. The programmed
register values are the same before and after the patch.
