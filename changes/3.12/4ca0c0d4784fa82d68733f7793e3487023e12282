ASoC: Samsung: I2S: Modify the I2S driver to support I2S on Exynos5420

Exynos5420 added support for I2S TDM mode. For this, there are some
register changes in the I2S controller. This patch adds the relevant
register changes to support I2S in normal mode. This patch adds a
quirk for TDM mode and if TDM mode is present all the relevent changes
will be applied.
