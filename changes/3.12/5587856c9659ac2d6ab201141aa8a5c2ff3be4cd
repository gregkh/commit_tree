IB/iser: Introduce fast memory registration model (FRWR)

Newer HCAs and Virtual functions may not support FMRs but rather a fast
registration model, which we call FRWR - "Fast Registration Work Requests".

This model was introduced in 00f7ec36c ("RDMA/core: Add memory management
extensions support") and works when the IB device supports the
IB_DEVICE_MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS capability.

Upon creating the iser device iser will test whether the HCA supports
FMRs.  If no support for FMRs, check if IB_DEVICE_MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS
is supported and assign function pointers that handle fast
registration and allocation of appropriate resources (fast_reg
descriptors).

Registration is done using posting IB_WR_FAST_REG_MR to the QP and
invalidations using posting IB_WR_LOCAL_INV.
