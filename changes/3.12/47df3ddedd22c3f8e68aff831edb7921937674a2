writeback: fix occasional slow sync(1)

In case when system contains no dirty pages, wakeup_flusher_threads() will
submit WB_SYNC_NONE writeback for 0 pages so wb_writeback() exits
immediately without doing anything, even though there are dirty inodes in
the system.  Thus sync(1) will write all the dirty inodes from a
WB_SYNC_ALL writeback pass which is slow.

Fix the problem by using get_nr_dirty_pages() in wakeup_flusher_threads()
instead of calculating number of dirty pages manually.  That function also
takes number of dirty inodes into account.
