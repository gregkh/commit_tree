slcan: rewrite of slc_bump and slc_encaps

The old implementation was heavy on str* functions and sprintf calls.
This version is more manual, but faster.

Profiling just the printing of a 3 char CAN-id resulted in 60 instructions
for the manual method and over 2000 for the sprintf method. Bear in
mind the profiling was done against libc and not the kernel sprintf.

Together with this rewrite an issue with sending and receiving of RTR frames
has been fixed by Oliver for the cases that the DLC is not zero.
