tty: ar933x_uart: use the clk API to get the uart clock

The AR933x UARTs are only used on the Atheros AR933x
SoCs. The base clock frequency of the UART is passed
to the driver via platform data. The SoC support code
implements the generic clock API, and the clock rate
can be retrieved via that.

Update the code to get the clock rate via the generic
clock API instead of using the platform data.
