memstick: add support for legacy memorysticks

Based partially on MS standard spec quotes from Alex Dubov.

As any code that works with user data this driver isn't recommended to use
to write cards that contain valuable data.

It tries its best though to avoid data corruption and possible damage to
the card.

Tested on MS DUO 64 MB card on Ricoh R592 card reader.
