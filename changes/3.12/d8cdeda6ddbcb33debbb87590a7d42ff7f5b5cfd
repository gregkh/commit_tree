net: tcp_probe: kprobes: adapt jtcp_rcv_established signature

This patches fixes a rather unproblematic function signature mismatch
as the const specifier was missing for the th variable; and next to
that it adds a build-time assertion so that future function signature
mismatches for kprobes will not end badly, similarly as commit 22222997
("net: sctp: add build check for sctp_sf_eat_sack_6_2/jsctp_sf_eat_sack")
did it for SCTP.
