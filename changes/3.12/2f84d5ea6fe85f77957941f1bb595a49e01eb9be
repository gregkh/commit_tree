ppc: kvm: use anon_inode_getfd() with O_CLOEXEC flag

KVM uses anon_inode_get() to allocate file descriptors as part
of some of its ioctls. But those ioctls are lacking a flag argument
allowing userspace to choose options for the newly opened file descriptor.

In such case it's advised to use O_CLOEXEC by default so that
userspace is allowed to choose, without race, if the file descriptor
is going to be inherited across exec().

This patch set O_CLOEXEC flag on all file descriptors created
with anon_inode_getfd() to not leak file descriptors across exec().
