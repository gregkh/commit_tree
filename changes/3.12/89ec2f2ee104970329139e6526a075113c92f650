ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Don't trim devices before scanning the namespace

In acpiphp_bus_add() we first remove device objects corresponding to
the given handle and the ACPI namespace branch below it, which are
then re-created by acpi_bus_scan().  This used to be done to clean
up after surprise removals, but now we do the cleanup through
trim_stale_devices() which checks if the devices in question are
actually gone before removing them, so the device hierarchy trimming
in acpiphp_bus_add() is not necessary any more and, moreover, it may
lead to problems if it removes device objects corresponding to
devices that are actually present.

For this reason, remove the leftover acpiphp_bus_trim() from
acpiphp_bus_add().
