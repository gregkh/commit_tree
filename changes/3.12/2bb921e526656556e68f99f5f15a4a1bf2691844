vmstat: create separate function to fold per cpu diffs into local counters

The main idea behind this patchset is to reduce the vmstat update overhead
by avoiding interrupt enable/disable and the use of per cpu atomics.

This patch (of 3):

It is better to have a separate folding function because
refresh_cpu_vm_stats() also does other things like expire pages in the
page allocator caches.

If we have a separate function then refresh_cpu_vm_stats() is only called
from the local cpu which allows additional optimizations.

The folding function is only called when a cpu is being downed and
therefore no other processor will be accessing the counters.  Also
simplifies synchronization.
