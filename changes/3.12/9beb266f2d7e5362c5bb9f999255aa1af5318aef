exec: proc_exec_connector() should be called only once

A separate one-liner with the minor fix.

PROC_EVENT_EXEC reports the "exec" event, but this message is sent at
least twice if search_binary_handler() is called by ->load_binary()
recursively, say, load_script().

Move it to exec_binprm(), this is "depth == 0" code too.
