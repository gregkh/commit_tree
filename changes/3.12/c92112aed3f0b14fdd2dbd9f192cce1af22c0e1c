vhost_net: use vhost_add_used_and_signal_n() in vhost_zerocopy_signal_used()

We tend to batch the used adding and signaling in vhost_zerocopy_callback()
which may result more than 100 used buffers to be updated in
vhost_zerocopy_signal_used() in some cases. So switch to use
vhost_add_used_and_signal_n() to avoid multiple calls to
vhost_add_used_and_signal(). Which means much less times of used index
updating and memory barriers.

2% performance improvement were seen on netperf TCP_RR test.
