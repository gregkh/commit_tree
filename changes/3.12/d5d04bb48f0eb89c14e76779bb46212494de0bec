Bye, bye, WfW flag

This reverts the Linux for Workgroups thing.  And no, before somebody
asks, we're not doing Linux95.  Not for a few years, at least.

Sure, the flag added some color to the logo, and could have remained as
a testament to my leet gimp skills.  But no.  And I'll do this early, to
avoid the chance of forgetting when I'm doing the actual rc1 release on
the road.
