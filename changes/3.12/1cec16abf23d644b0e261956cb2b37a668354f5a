When CONFIG_NFS_V4_1 is not enabled, "make C=2" emits this warning:

linux/fs/nfs/nfs4session.c:337:6: warning:
 symbol 'nfs41_set_target_slotid' was not declared. Should it be static?

Move nfs41_set_target_slotid() and nfs41_update_target_slotid() back
behind CONFIG_NFS_V4_1, since, in the final revision of this work,
they are used only in NFSv4.1 and later.
