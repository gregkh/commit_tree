USB: EHCI: improve interrupt qh unlink

ehci-hcd currently unlinks an interrupt QH when it becomes empty, that
is, after its last URB completes.  This works well because in almost
all cases, the completion handler for an interrupt URB resubmits the
URB; therefore the QH doesn't become empty and doesn't get unlinked.

When we start using tasklets for URB completion, this scheme won't work
as well.  The resubmission won't occur until the tasklet runs, which
will be some time after the completion is queued with the tasklet.
During that delay, the QH will be empty and so will be unlinked
unnecessarily.

To prevent this problem, this patch adds a 5-ms time delay before empty
interrupt QHs are unlinked.  Most often, during that time the interrupt
URB will be resubmitted and thus we can avoid unlinking the QH.
