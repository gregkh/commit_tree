cpuidle: Make cpuidle's sysfs directory dynamically allocated

The cpuidle sysfs code is designed to have a single instance of per
CPU cpuidle directory.  It is not possible to remove the sysfs entry
and create it again.  This is not a problem with the current code but
future changes will add CPU hotplug support to enable/disable the
device, so it will need to remove the sysfs entry like other
subsystems do.  That won't be possible without this change, because
the kobj is a static object which can't be reused for
kobj_init_and_add().

Add cpuidle_device_kobj to be allocated dynamically when
adding/removing a sysfs entry which is consistent with the other
cpuidle's sysfs entries.

An added benefit is that the sysfs code is now more self-contained
and the includes needed for sysfs can be moved from cpuidle.h
directly into sysfs.c so as to reduce the total number of headers
dragged along with cpuidle.h.
