tile: support LSI MEGARAID SAS HBA hybrid dma_ops

The LSI MEGARAID SAS HBA suffers from the problem where it can do
64-bit DMA to streaming buffers but not to consistent buffers.
In other words, 64-bit DMA is used for disk data transfers and 32-bit
DMA must be used for control message transfers. According to LSI,
the firmware is not fully functional yet. This change implements a
kind of hybrid dma_ops to support this.

Note that on most other platforms, the 64-bit DMA addressing space is the
same as the 32-bit DMA space and they overlap the physical memory space.
No special arrangement is needed to support this kind of mixed DMA
capability.  On TILE-Gx, the 64-bit DMA space is completely separate
from the 32-bit DMA space.  Due to the use of the IOMMU, the 64-bit DMA
space doesn't overlap the physical memory space.  On the other hand,
the 32-bit DMA space overlaps the physical memory space under 4GB.
The separate address spaces make it necessary to have separate dma_ops.
