staging: vt6656: desc.h: remove typedef struct tagSTxDataHead_g to new structure in rxtx.h

To new structure.
typedef struct tagSTxDataHead_g -> struct vnt_tx_datahead_g

This is only needed by rxtc.c so moved to rxtx.h visible to
vnt_rts*/vnt_cts* structures which it will eventually form part of
their structure.
