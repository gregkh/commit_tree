btrfs: Introduce extent_read_full_page_nolock()

We want this for btrfs_extent_same. Basically readpage and friends do their
own extent locking but for the purposes of dedupe, we want to have both
files locked down across a set of readpage operations (so that we can
compare data). Introduce this variant and a flag which can be set for
extent_read_full_page() to indicate that we are already locked.

Partial credit for this patch goes to Gabriel de Perthuis <g2p.code@gmail.com>
as I have included a fix from him to the original patch which avoids a
deadlock on compressed extents.
