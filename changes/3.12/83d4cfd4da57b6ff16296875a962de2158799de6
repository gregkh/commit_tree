Btrfs: fixup error handling in btrfs_reloc_cow

If we failed to actually allocate the correct size of the extent to relocate we
will end up in an infinite loop because we won't return an error, we'll just
move on to the next extent.  So fix this up by returning an error, and then fix
all the callers to return an error up the stack rather than BUG_ON()'ing.
Thanks,
