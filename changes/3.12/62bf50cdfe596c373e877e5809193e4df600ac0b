staging: comedi: allow ISA and PC/104 drivers on non-ISA systems

Embedded systems with a PC/104 bus might have a configuration that
does not have ISA enabled. This creates a problem in Comedi where
the PC/104 drivers cannot be enabled.

Remove the 'depends on ISA' for the "Comedi ISA and PC/104 drivers"
menu to allow the user to select these drivers on non-ISA systems.
