PCI: Wake-up devices before saving config space for reset

Devices come out of reset in D0.  Restoring a device to a different
post-reset state takes more smarts than our simple config space
restore, which can leave devices in an inconsistent state.  For
example, if a device is reset in D3, but the restore doesn't
successfully return the device to D3, then the actual state of the
device and dev->current_state are contradictory.  Put everything
in D0 going into the reset, then we don't need to do anything
special on the way out.
