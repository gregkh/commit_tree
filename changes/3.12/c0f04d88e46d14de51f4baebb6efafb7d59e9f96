bcache: Fix flushes in writeback mode

In writeback mode, when we get a cache flush we need to make sure we
issue a flush to the backing device.

The code for sending down an extra flush was wrong - by cloning the bio
we were probably getting flags that didn't make sense for a bare flush,
and also the old code was firing for FUA bios, for which we don't need
to send a flush to the backing device.

This was causing data corruption somehow - the mechanism was never
determined, but this patch fixes it for the users that were seeing it.
