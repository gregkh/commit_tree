tracing/perf: Expand TRACE_EVENT(sched_stat_runtime)

To simplify the review of the next patches:

1. We are going to reimplent __perf_task/counter and embedd them
   into TP_ARGS(). expand TRACE_EVENT(sched_stat_runtime) into
   DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS() + DEFINE_EVENT(), this way they can use
   different TP_ARGS's.

2. Change perf_trace_##call() macro to do perf_fetch_caller_regs()
   right before perf_trace_buf_prepare().

   This way it evaluates TP_ARGS() asap, the next patch explores
   this fact.

   Note: after 87f44bbc perf_trace_buf_prepare() doesn't need
   "struct pt_regs *regs", perhaps it makes sense to remove this
   argument. And perhaps we can teach perf_trace_buf_submit()
   to accept regs == NULL and do fetch_caller_regs(CALLER_ADDR1)
   in this case.

3. Cosmetic, but the typecast from "void*" buys nothing. It just
   adds the noise, remove it.
