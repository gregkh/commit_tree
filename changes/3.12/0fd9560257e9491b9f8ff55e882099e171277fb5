OMAPDSS: Return right error during connector probe

While using HDMI connector driver with sil9022 encoder
came across issue where connector driver is probed first.
This resulted in error. A deffered probe solved this.
Most connector drivers need a encoder driver as their
video source. This patch ensures we do a probe defferal
if video source is not present for connector drivers.
