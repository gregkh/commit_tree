qlcnic: Enhance PVID handling for 84xx adapters

o PF driver should not indicate PVID configuration to VF driver.
  As adapter supports VLAN stripping, VF driver should stay agnostic
  to any PVID configuration.

o Return "QLC_NO_VLAN_MODE(= 0)" to VFD when PVID is configured.
  VF driver should be in no VLAN configuration mode.
