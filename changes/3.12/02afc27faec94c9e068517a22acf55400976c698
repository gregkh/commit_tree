direct-io: Handle O_(D)SYNC AIO

Call generic_write_sync() from the deferred I/O completion handler if
O_DSYNC is set for a write request.  Also make sure various callers
don't call generic_write_sync if the direct I/O code returns
-EIOCBQUEUED.

Based on an earlier patch from Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz> with updates from
Jeff Moyer <jmoyer@redhat.com> and Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>.
