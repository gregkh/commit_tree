ACPICA: Add acpi_update_interfaces() public interface

Add new API to allow OSPM to disable/enable specific types of _OSI
interface strings.

ACPICA does not have the knowledge about whether an _OSI interface
string is an OS vendor string or a feature group string and there
isn't any API interface to allow OSPM to install a new interface
string as a feature group string.
This patch simply adds all feature group strings defined by ACPI
specification into the acpi_default_supported_interfaces with
ACPI_OSI_FEATURE flag set to fix this gap.  This patch also adds
codes to keep their default states as ACPI_OSI_INVALID before the
initialization and after the termination.
