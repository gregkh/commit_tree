ASoC: dapm: Pass snd_soc_card directly to soc_dpcm_runtime_update()

soc_dpcm_runtime_update() operates on a ASoC card as a whole. Currently it takes
a snd_soc_dapm_widget as its only parameter though. The widget is then used to
look up the card and is otherwise unused. This patch changes the function to
take a pointer to the card directly. This makes it possible to to call
soc_dpcm_runtime_update() for updates which are not related to one specific
widget.
