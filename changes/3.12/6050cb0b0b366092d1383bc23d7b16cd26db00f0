perf: Fix branch stack refcount leak on callchain init failure

On callchain buffers allocation failure, free_event() is
called and all the accounting performed in perf_event_alloc()
for that event is cancelled.

But if the event has branch stack sampling, it is unaccounted
as well from the branch stack sampling events refcounts.

This is a bug because this accounting is performed after the
callchain buffer allocation. As a result, the branch stack sampling
events refcount can become negative.

To fix this, move the branch stack event accounting before the
callchain buffer allocation.
