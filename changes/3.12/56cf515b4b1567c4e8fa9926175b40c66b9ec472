sched: Clean-up struct sd_lb_stat

There is no reason to maintain separate variables for this_group
and busiest_group in sd_lb_stat, except saving some space.
But this structure is always allocated in stack, so this saving
isn't really benificial [peterz: reducing stack space is good; in this
case readability increases enough that I think its still beneficial]

This patch unify these variables, so IMO, readability may be improved.
