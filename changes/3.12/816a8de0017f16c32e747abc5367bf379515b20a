ARM: topology: remove hwid/MPIDR dependency from cpu_capacity

Currently the topology code computes cpu capacity and stores it in
the list along with hwid(which is MPIDR) as it parses the CPU nodes
in the device tree. This is required as it needs to be mapped to the
logical CPU later.

Since the CPU device nodes can be retrieved in the logical ordering
using DT/OF helpers, its possible to store cpu_capacity also in logical
ordering and avoid storing hwid for each entry.

This patch removes hwid by making use of of_get_cpu_node.
