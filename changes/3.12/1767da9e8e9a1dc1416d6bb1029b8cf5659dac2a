regmap: fix regcache_reg_present() for empty cache

In the initial case when no reg_defaults values are
provided and no register value was added to the cache
yet, the cache_present bitmap is NULL. If this function
is invoked for any register it should return false
(i.e. the register is not cached) instead of true.
