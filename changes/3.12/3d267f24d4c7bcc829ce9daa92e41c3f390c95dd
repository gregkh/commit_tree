firmware/dmi_scan: drop obsolete comment

This comment predates the introduction of early_ioremap.  Since then the
missing calls to dmi_iounmap have been added by Ingo and Yinghai in
commits 0d64484f7ea1 ("x86: fix DMI ioremap leak") and 3212bff370c2
("x86: left over fix for leak of early_ioremp in dmi_scan") .  That was
over 5 years ago so it is about time to drop this now misleading
comment.
