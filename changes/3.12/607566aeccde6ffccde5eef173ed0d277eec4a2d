CacheFiles: Fix memory leak in cachefiles_check_auxdata error paths

In cachefiles_check_auxdata(), we allocate auxbuf but fail to free it if
we determine there's an error or that the data is stale.

Further, assigning the output of vfs_getxattr() to auxbuf->len gives
problems with checking for errors as auxbuf->len is a u16.  We don't
actually need to set auxbuf->len, so keep the length in a variable for
now.  We shouldn't need to check the upper limit of the buffer as an
overflow there should be indicated by -ERANGE.

While we're at it, fscache_check_aux() returns an enum value, not an
int, so assign it to an appropriately typed variable rather than to ret.
