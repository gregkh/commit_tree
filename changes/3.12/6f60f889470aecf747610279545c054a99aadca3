ceph: fix freeing inode vs removing session caps race

remove_session_caps() uses iterate_session_caps() to remove caps,
but iterate_session_caps() skips inodes that are being deleted.
So session->s_nr_caps can be non-zero after iterate_session_caps()
return.

We can fix the issue by waiting until deletions are complete.
__wait_on_freeing_inode() is designed for the job, but it is not
exported, so we use lookup inode function to access it.
