xfs: split out transaction reservation code

The transaction reservation size calculations is used by both kernel
and userspace, but most of the transaction code in xfs_trans.c is
kernel specific. Split all the transaction reservation code out into
it's own files to make sharing with userspace simpler. This just
leaves kernel-only definitions in xfs_trans.h, so it doesn't need to
be shared with userspace anymore, either.
