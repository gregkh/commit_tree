xfs: avoid double-free in xfs_attr_node_addname

xfs_attr_node_addname()'s error handling tests whether it
should free "state" in the out: error handling label:

out:
        if (state)
                xfs_da_state_free(state);

but an earlier free doesn't set state to NULL afterwards; this
could lead to a double free.  Fix it by setting state to NULL
after it's freed.
