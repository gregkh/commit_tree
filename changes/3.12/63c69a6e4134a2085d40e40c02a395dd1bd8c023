ASoC: dapm: Use generic power check for everything except DAIs

As noticed by Lars-Peter Clausen since the move to using widgets to hook
into the DAIs we no longer directly manage the power of AIF or DAC/ADC
widgets from the stream integration so they can just use the generic power
checks instead of the custom stream integration ones they currently do.
