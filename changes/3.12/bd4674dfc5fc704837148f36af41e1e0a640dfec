ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Embed function struct into struct acpiphp_context

Since there has to be a struct acpiphp_func object for every struct
acpiphp_context created by register_slot(), the struct acpiphp_func
one can be embedded into the struct acpiphp_context one, which allows
some code simplifications to be made.
