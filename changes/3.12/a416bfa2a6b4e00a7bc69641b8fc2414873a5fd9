tty: serial: cpm_uart: Adding proper request of GPIO used by cpm_uart driver

cpm_uart serial driver uses GPIO for control signals. In order to be used
properly, GPIOs have to be reserved. Comment in gpiolib.c considers illegal
the use of GPIOs without requesting them. In addition, the direction of the
GPIO has to be set properly.
