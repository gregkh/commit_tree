bus: mvebu-mbus: Factor out initialization details

We introduce a common initialization function mvebu_mbus_common_init()
that will be used by both legacy and device-tree initialization code.
This patch is an intermediate step, which will allow to introduce the
DT binding for this driver in a less intrusive way.
