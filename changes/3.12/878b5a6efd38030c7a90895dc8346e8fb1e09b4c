uprobes: Fix utask->depth accounting in handle_trampoline()

Currently utask->depth is simply the number of allocated/pending
return_instance's in uprobe_task->return_instances list.

handle_trampoline() should decrement this counter every time we
handle/free an instance, but due to typo it does this only if
->chained == T. This means that in the likely case this counter
is never decremented and the probed task can't report more than
MAX_URETPROBE_DEPTH events.
