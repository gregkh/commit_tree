tun: Add ability to create tun device with given index

Tun devices cannot be created with ifidex user wants, but it's
required by checkpoint-restore project.

Long time ago such ability was implemented for rtnl_ops-based
interface for creating links (9c7dafbf net: Allow to create links
with given ifindex), but the only API for creating and managing
tuntap devices is ioctl-based and is evolving with adding new ones
(cde8b15f tuntap: add ioctl to attach or detach a file form tuntap
device).

Following that trend, here's how a new ioctl that sets the ifindex
for device, that _will_ be created by TUNSETIFF ioctl looks like.
So those who want a tuntap device with the ifindex N, should open
the tun device, call ioctl(fd, TUNSETIFINDEX, &N), then call TUNSETIFF.
If the index N is busy, then the register_netdev will find this out
and the ioctl would be failed with -EBUSY.

If setifindex is not called, then it will be generated as before.
