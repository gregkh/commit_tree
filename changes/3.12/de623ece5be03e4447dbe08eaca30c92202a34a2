ASoC: fsl-ssi: Add support for imx-pcm-fiq

Add support for non-dma pcm for imx platforms with imx-pcm-fiq support.
Instead of imx-pcm-audio, in this case imx-pcm-fiq-audio device is added
and the SIER flags are set differently.

We need imx-pcm-fiq for some boards that use an incompatible codec.
imx-pcm-fiq handles those codecs differently and allows to operate with
them. DMA is not possible because some data sent by the codecs, e.g.
wm9712, is not in the datastream. Also some data is mixed up in the
fifos, so that we need to sort them out manually.
