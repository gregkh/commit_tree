Revert "Input: introduce BTN/ABS bits for drums and guitars"

This reverts commits 61e00655e9cb, 73f8645db191 and 8e22ecb603c8:
  "Input: introduce BTN/ABS bits for drums and guitars"
  "HID: wiimote: add support for Guitar-Hero drums"
  "HID: wiimote: add support for Guitar-Hero guitars"

The extra new ABS_xx values resulted in ABS_MAX no longer being a
power-of-two, which broke the comparison logic.  It also caused the
ioctl numbers to overflow into the next byte, causing problems for that.

We'll try again for 3.13.
