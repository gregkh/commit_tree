crypto: api - Fix race condition in larval lookup

crypto_larval_lookup should only return a larval if it created one.
Any larval created by another entity must be processed through
crypto_larval_wait before being returned.

Otherwise this will lead to a larval being killed twice, which
will most likely lead to a crash.
