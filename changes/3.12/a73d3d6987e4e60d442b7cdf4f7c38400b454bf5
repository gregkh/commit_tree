n_tty: Replace canon_data with index comparison

canon_data represented the # of lines which had been copied
to the receive buffer but not yet copied to the user buffer.
The value was tested to determine if input was available in
canonical mode (and also to force input overrun if the
receive buffer was full but a newline had not been received).

However, the actual count was irrelevent; only whether it was
non-zero (meaning 'is there any input to transfer?'). This
shared count is unnecessary and unsafe with a lockless algorithm.
The same check is made by comparing canon_head with read_tail instead.
