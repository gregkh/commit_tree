xfs: move getdents code into it's own file

The directory readdir code is not used by userspace, but it is
intermingled with files that are shared with userspace. This makes
it difficult to compare the differences between the userspac eand
kernel files are the userspace files don't have the getdents code in
them. Move all the kernel getdents code to a separate file to bring
the shared content between userspace and kernel files closer
together.
