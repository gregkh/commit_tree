hwmon: (applesmc) Always read until end of data

The crash reported and investigated in commit 5f4513 turned out to be
caused by a change to the read interface on newer (2012) SMCs.

Tests by Chris show that simply reading the data valid line is enough
for the problem to go away. Additional tests show that the newer SMCs
no longer wait for the number of requested bytes, but start sending
data right away.  Apparently the number of bytes to read is no longer
specified as before, but instead found out by reading until end of
data. Failure to read until end of data confuses the state machine,
which eventually causes the crash.

As a remedy, assuming bit0 is the read valid line, make sure there is
nothing more to read before leaving the read function.

Tested to resolve the original problem, and runtested on MBA3,1,
MBP4,1, MBP8,2, MBP10,1, MBP10,2. The patch seems to have no effect on
machines before 2012.
