powerpc/pseries: Child nodes are not detached by dlpar_detach_node

Calls to dlpar_detach_node do not iterate over child nodes detaching them as
well. By iterating and detaching the child nodes we ensure that they have the
OF_DETACHED flag set and that their reference counts are decremented such that
the node will be freed from memory by of_node_release.
