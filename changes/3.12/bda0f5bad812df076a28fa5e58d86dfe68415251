tile: various console improvements

This change improves and cleans up the tile console.

- We enable HVC_IRQ support on tilegx, with the addition of a new
  Tilera hypervisor API for tilegx to allow a console IPI.  If IPI
  support is not available we fall back to the previous polling mode.

- We simplify the earlyprintk code to use CON_BOOT and eliminate some
  of the other supporting earlyprintk code.

- A new tile_console_write() primitive is used to send output to
  the console and is factored out of the hvc_tile driver.
  This lets us support a "sim_console" boot argument to allow using
  simulator hooks to send output to the "console" as a slightly
  faster alternative to emulating the hardware more directly.
