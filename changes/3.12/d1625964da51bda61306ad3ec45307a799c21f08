cgroup: fix cgroup_css() invocation in css_from_id()

ca8bdcaff0 ("cgroup: make cgroup_css() take cgroup_subsys * instead
and allow NULL subsys") missed one conversion in css_from_id(), which
was newly added.  As css_from_id() doesn't have any user yet, this
doesn't break anything other than generating a build warning.

Convert it.
