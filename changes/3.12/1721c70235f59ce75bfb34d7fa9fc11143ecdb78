ARM: OMAP: AM33XX: hwmod: Add hwmod data for debugSS

In the original hwmod data file, DebugSS entry was disabled,
since we didn't (and do not) have SW to control it.

This patch enables it back with right data, so that it can be
controlled by different ways; and the suggested method it to
have modular driver for debugSS as well.
