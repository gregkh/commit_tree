crypto: omap-sham - Add OMAP5/AM43XX SHAM Support

Add support for the OMAP5 version of the SHAM module
that is present on OMAP5 and AM43xx SoCs.

This module is very simialar to OMAP4 version of SHAM module,
and adds SHA384 SHA512 hardware-accelerated hash functions to it.
To handle the higher digest size of SHA512, few SHA512_DIGEST_i
(i=1-16, and first 8 registers are duplicated from SHA_DIGEST_i
registers) registers are added at the end of register set.
So adding the above register offsets and module info in pdata.
