ARM: OMAP: DRA7: CM: Add minimal regbit shifts

This header contains minimal regbits that are currently used in code.
This header has traditionally been autogenerated on OMAP4+ devices but
the autogenerated contents are largely (95%) unused and hence to reduce
unsued data in the kernel this header has been cut down (from the autogen
output) to whatever is currently needed. This is done by running a cleanup
script on top of the existing autogen script.
