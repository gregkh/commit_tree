MIPS: stack protector: Fix per-task canary switch

Commit 1400eb6 (MIPS: r4k,octeon,r2300: stack protector: change canary
per task) was merged in v3.11 and introduced assembly in the MIPS resume
functions to update the value of the current canary in
__stack_chk_guard. However it used PTR_L resulting in a load of the
canary value, instead of PTR_LA to construct its address. The value is
intended to be random but is then treated as an address in the
subsequent LONG_S (store).

This was observed to cause a fault and panic:

CPU 0 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 139fea20, epc == 8000cc0c, ra == 8034f2a4
Oops[#1]:

This can also be forced by modifying
arch/mips/include/asm/stackprotector.h so that the default
__stack_chk_guard value is more likely to be a bad (or unaligned)
pointer.

Fix it to use PTR_LA instead, to load the address of the canary value,
which the LONG_S can then use to write into it.
