brcmsmac: change pa_gain for bcm4313 iPA

The function wlc_lcnphy_load_tx_gain_table() has a target PA
gain specified for the iPA variant of the bcm4313. This gain
value is reduced to avoid PA distortion. The if-statement is
removed because it was rather redundant in the first place.
Please note that this patch does not provide full iPA support.
