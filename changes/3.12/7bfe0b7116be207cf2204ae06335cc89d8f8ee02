tty: Track flip buffer memory limit atomically

Lockless flip buffers require atomically updating the bytes-in-use
watermark.

The pty driver also peeks at the watermark value to limit
memory consumption to a much lower value than the default; query
the watermark with new fn, tty_buffer_space_avail().
