bnx2x: Restore a call to config_init

Commit c0a77ec74f295013d7ba3204dd3ed25fccf83cb4 'bnx2x: Add missing braces in
bnx2x:bnx2x_link_initialize' identified indentation problem, but resolved it
by adding braces instead of fixing the indentation. The braces now prevents a
config_init call in some cases, though it should be called regardless of that
condition. This patch removes the braces and fix the confusing indentation
that caused this mess.
