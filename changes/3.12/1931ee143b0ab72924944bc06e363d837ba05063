Revert "drivers: of: add initialization code for dma reserved memory"

This reverts commit 9d8eab7af79cb4ce2de5de39f82c455b1f796963. There is
still no consensus on the bindings for the reserved memory and various
drawbacks of the proposed solution has been shown, so the best now is to
revert it completely and start again from scratch later.
