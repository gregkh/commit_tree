Btrfs: don't cache the csum value into the extent state tree

Before applying this patch, we cached the csum value into the extent state
tree when reading some data from the disk, this operation increased the lock
contention of the state tree.

Now, we just store the csum value into the bio structure or other unshared
structure, so we can reduce the lock contention.
