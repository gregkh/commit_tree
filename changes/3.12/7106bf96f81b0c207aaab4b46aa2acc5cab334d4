drm/prime: add a bit of documentation about gem_obj->import_attach

Lifetime rules seem to be solid around ->import_attach. So this patch
just properly documents them.

Note that pointing directly at the attachment might have issues for
devices that have multiple struct device *dev parts constituting the
logical gpu and so might need multiple attachment points. Similarly
for drm devices which don't need a dma attachment at all (like udl).

But fixing that up is material for different patches.
