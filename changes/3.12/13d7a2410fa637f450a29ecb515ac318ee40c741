perf: Add attr->mmap2 attribute to an event

Adds a new PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 record type which is essence
an expanded version of PERF_RECORD_MMAP.

Used to request mmap records with more information about
the mapping, including device major, minor and the inode
number and generation for mappings associated with files
or shared memory segments. Works for code and data
(with attr->mmap_data set).

Existing PERF_RECORD_MMAP record is unmodified by this patch.
