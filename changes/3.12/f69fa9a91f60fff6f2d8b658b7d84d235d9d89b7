x86, doc: Update uaccess.h comment to reflect clang changes

Update comment in uaccess.h to reflect the changes for clang support:
gcc only cares about the base register (most architectures don't
encode the size of the operation in the operands like x86 does, and so
it is treated effectively like a register number), whereas clang tries
to enforce the size -- but not for register pairs.
