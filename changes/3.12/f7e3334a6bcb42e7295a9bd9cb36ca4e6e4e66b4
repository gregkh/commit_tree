powerpc: Fix memory hotplug with sparse vmemmap

Previous commit 46723bfa540... introduced a new config option
HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE that ended up breaking memory hot-remove for ppc
when sparse vmemmap is not defined.

This patch defines HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE for ppc and adds the call to
register_page_bootmem_info_node. Without this we get a BUG_ON for memory
hot remove in put_page_bootmem().

This also adds a stub for register_page_bootmem_memmap to allow ppc to build
with sparse vmemmap defined. Leaving this as a stub is fine since the same
vmemmap addresses are also handled in vmemmap_populate and as such are
properly mapped.
