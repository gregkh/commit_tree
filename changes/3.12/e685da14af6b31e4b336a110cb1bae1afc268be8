Btrfs: move btrfs_free_qgroup_config() out of spin_lock and fix comments

btrfs_free_qgroup_config() is not only called by open/close_ctree(),but
also btrfs_disable_quota().And for btrfs_disable_quota(),we have set
'quota_root' to be null before calling btrfs_free_qgroup_config(),so it
is safe to cleanup in-memory structures without lock held.
