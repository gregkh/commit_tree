Btrfs: add btrfs_alloc_device and switch to it

Currently btrfs_device is allocated ad-hoc in a few different places,
and as a result not all fields are initialized properly.  In particular,
readahead state is only initialized in device_list_add (at scan time),
and not in btrfs_init_new_device (when the new device is added with
'btrfs dev add').  Fix this by adding an allocation helper and switch
everybody but __btrfs_close_devices to it.  (__btrfs_close_devices is
dealt with in a later commit.)
