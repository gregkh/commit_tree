vfs: make getcwd() get the root and pwd path under rcu

This allows us to skip all the crazy spinlocks and reference count
updates, and instead use the fs sequence read-lock to get an atomic
snapshot of the root and cwd information.

We might want to make the rule that "prepend_path()" is always called
with the RCU lock held, but the RCU lock nests fine and this is the
minimal fix.
