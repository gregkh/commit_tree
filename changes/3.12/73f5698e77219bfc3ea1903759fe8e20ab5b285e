fib_rules: fix suppressor names and default values

This change brings the suppressor attribute names into line; it also changes
the data types to provide a more consistent interface.

While -1 indicates that the suppressor is not enabled, values >= 0 for
suppress_prefixlen or suppress_ifgroup  reject routing decisions violating the
constraint.

This changes the previously presented behaviour of suppress_prefixlen, where a
prefix length _less_ than the attribute value was rejected. After this change,
a prefix length less than *or* equal to the value is considered a violation of
the rule constraint.

It also changes the default values for default and newly added rules (disabling
any suppression for those).
