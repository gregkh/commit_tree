cpufreq: remove cpufreq_policy_cpu per-cpu variable

cpufreq_policy_cpu per-cpu variables are used for storing the ID of
the CPU that manages the given CPU's policy.  However, we also store
a policy pointer for each cpu in cpufreq_cpu_data, so the
cpufreq_policy_cpu information is simply redundant.

It is better to use cpufreq_cpu_data to retrieve a policy and get
policy->cpu from there, so make that happen everywhere and drop the
cpufreq_policy_cpu per-cpu variables which aren't necessary any more.
