[SCSI] Generate uevents on certain unit attention codes

Generate a uevent when the following Unit Attention ASC/ASCQ
codes are received:

    2A/01  MODE PARAMETERS CHANGED
    2A/09  CAPACITY DATA HAS CHANGED
    38/07  THIN PROVISIONING SOFT THRESHOLD REACHED
    3F/03  INQUIRY DATA HAS CHANGED
    3F/0E  REPORTED LUNS DATA HAS CHANGED

Log kernel messages when the following Unit Attention ASC/ASCQ
codes are received that are not as specific as those above:

    2A/xx  PARAMETERS CHANGED
    3F/xx  TARGET OPERATING CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED

Added logic to set expecting_lun_change for other LUNs on the target
after REPORTED LUNS DATA HAS CHANGED is received, so that duplicate
uevents are not generated, and clear expecting_lun_change when a
REPORT LUNS command completes, in accordance with the SPC-3
specification regarding reporting of the 3F 0E ASC/ASCQ UA.

[jejb: remove SPC3 test in scsi_report_lun_change and some docbook fixes and
       unused variable fix, both reported by Fengguang Wu]
