DMA: fix printk warning in AMBA PL08x DMA driver

In Rob's recent pull request the patch
	ARM: highbank: select ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT for LPAE
promotes dma_addr_t to 64bit, so printk generates a warning about
an incorrect type. Fix this by casting it to u64 and using %llx.
Fixing long lines on the way.
