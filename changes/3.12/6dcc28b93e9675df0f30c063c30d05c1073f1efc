ixgbe: fully disable hardware RSC logic when disabling RSC

This patch modifies the configure_rx path in order to properly disable RSC
hardware logic when the user disables it. Previously we only disabled RSC in the
queue settings, but this does not fully disable hardware RSC logic which can
lead to some unexpected performance issues.
