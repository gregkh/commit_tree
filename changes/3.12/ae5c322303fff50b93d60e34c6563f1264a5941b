ASoC: add Renesas R-Car SSI feature

Renesas R-Car series sound circuit consists of SSI and its peripheral.
But this peripheral circuit is different between
R-Car Generation1 (E1/M1/H1) and Generation2 (E2/M2/H2)
(Actually, there are many difference in Generation1 chips)

As 1st protype, this patch adds SSI feature on this driver.
But, it is PIO sound playback support only at this point.
The DMA transfer, and capture feature will be supported in the future
