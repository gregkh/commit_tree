Thermal: x86_pkg_temp: change spin lock

x86_pkg_temp receives thermal notifications via a callback from a
therm_throt driver, where thermal interrupts are processed.
This callback is pkg_temp_thermal_platform_thermal_notify. Here to
avoid multiple interrupts from cores in a package, we disable the
source and also set a variable to avoid scheduling delayed work function.
This variable is protected via spin_lock_irqsave. On one buggy platform,
we still receiving interrupts even if the source is disabled. This
can cause deadlock/lockdep warning, when interrupt is generated while under
spinlock in work function.
Change spin_lock to spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock to
spin_unlock_irqrestore as the data it is trying to protect can also
be modified in a notification call called from interrupt handler.
