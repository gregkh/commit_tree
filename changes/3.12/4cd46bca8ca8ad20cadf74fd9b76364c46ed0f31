cpuidle: CodingStyle: Break up multiple assignments on single line

The function get_typical_interval() initializes a number of variables
that are immediately after declarations assigned constant values.
In addition, there are multiple assignments on a single line, which
is explicitly forbidden by Documentation/CodingStyle.

This patch removes redundant initial values for the variables and
breaks up the multiple assignment line.
