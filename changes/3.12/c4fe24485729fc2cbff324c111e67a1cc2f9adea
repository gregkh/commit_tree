sparc: fix PCI device proc file mmap(2)

Commit 786d7e1612f0b0adb6046f19b906609e4fe8b1ba "Fix rmmod/read/write races in /proc entries"
must have broken mmapping of PCI device proc files on Sparc.

Notice how it adds wrapper around ->mmap but doesn't do it around ->get_unmapped_area.
Add wrapper around ->get_unmapped_area.
