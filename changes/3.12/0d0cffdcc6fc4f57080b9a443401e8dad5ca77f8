gianfar: Cleanup TxFCB insertion on xmit

Cleanup gfar_start_xmit()'s fast path by factoring out "redundant"
FCB insertion code (repeated gfar_add_fcb() calls and related)
and by reducing the number of if() clauses (i.e. if(fcb) checks).
Improve maintainability (e.g. there's less code and easier to read)
also by introducing do_csum and do_vlan to mark the other 2 Tx TOE
functionalities, following the same model as do_tstamp.
fcb_len may also be 0 now, to mark that Tx FCB insertion conditions
(do_csum, do_vlan, do_tstamp) have not been met.
