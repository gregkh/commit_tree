net: sctp: trivial: update bug report in header comment

With the restructuring of the lksctp.org site, we only allow bug
reports through the SCTP mailing list linux-sctp@vger.kernel.org,
not via SF, as SF is only used for web hosting and nothing more.
While at it, also remove the obvious statement that bugs will be
fixed and incooperated into the kernel.
