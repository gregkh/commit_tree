n_tty: Eliminate char tests from IXANY restart test

Relocate the IXANY restart tty test to code paths where the
the received char is not START_CHAR, STOP_CHAR, INTR_CHAR,
QUIT_CHAR or SUSP_CHAR.

Fixes the condition when ISIG if off and one of INTR_CHAR,
QUIT_CHAR or SUSP_CHAR does not restart i/o.
