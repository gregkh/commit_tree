n_tty: Remove overflow tests from receive_buf() path

Always pre-figure the space available in the read_buf and limit
the inbound receive request to that amount.

For compatibility reasons with the non-flow-controlled interface,
n_tty_receive_buf() will continue filling read_buf until all data
has been received or receive_room() returns 0.
