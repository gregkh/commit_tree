netfilter: add SYNPROXY core/target

Add a SYNPROXY for netfilter. The code is split into two parts, the synproxy
core with common functions and an address family specific target.

The SYNPROXY receives the connection request from the client, responds with
a SYN/ACK containing a SYN cookie and announcing a zero window and checks
whether the final ACK from the client contains a valid cookie.

It then establishes a connection to the original destination and, if
successful, sends a window update to the client with the window size
announced by the server.

Support for timestamps, SACK, window scaling and MSS options can be
statically configured as target parameters if the features of the server
are known. If timestamps are used, the timestamp value sent back to
the client in the SYN/ACK will be different from the real timestamp of
the server. In order to now break PAWS, the timestamps are translated in
the direction server->client.
