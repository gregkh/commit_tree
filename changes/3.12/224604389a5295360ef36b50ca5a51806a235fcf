leds: lp5523: LED MUX configuration on initializing

LED MUX start and stop address should be updated in the program memory
on LP5523 initialization.
LED pattern doesn't work without additional MUX address configuration.
This handling is done by new function, lp5523_init_program_engine().
Eventually, it's called during device initialization, lp5523_post_init_device().

This is a conflict after git commit 632418bf65503405df3f9a6a1616f5a95f91db85
(leds-lp5523: clean up lp5523_configure()).
So it should be fixed.
