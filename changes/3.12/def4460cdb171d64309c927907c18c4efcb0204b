bonding: call slave_last_rx() only once per slave

Simple cleanup to not call slave_last_rx() on every time function. It won't
give any measurable boost - but looks cleaner and easier to understand.

There are no time-consuming functions in between these calls, so it's safe
to call it in the beginning only once.
