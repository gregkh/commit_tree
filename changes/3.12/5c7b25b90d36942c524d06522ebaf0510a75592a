[media] media: Add support for circular graph traversal

The graph traversal API (media_entity_graph_walk_*) doesn't support
cyclic graphs and will fail to correctly walk a graph when circular
links exist. Support circular graph traversal by checking whether an
entity has already been visited before pushing it to the stack.
