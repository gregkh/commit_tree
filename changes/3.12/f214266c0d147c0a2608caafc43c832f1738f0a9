drm/i915: unpin backing storage in dmabuf_unmap

This fixes a WARN in i915_gem_free_object when the
obj->pages_pin_count isn't 0.

v2: Add locking to unmap, noticed by Chris Wilson. Note that even
though we call unmap with our own dev->struct_mutex held that won't
result in an immediate deadlock since we never go through the dma_buf
interfaces for our own, reimported buffers. But it's still easy to
blow up and anger lockdep, but that's already the case with our ->map
implementation. Fixing this for real will involve per dma-buf ww mutex
locking by the callers. And lots of fun. So go with the duct-tape
approach for now.
