NFS: Never use user credentials for lease renewal

Never try to use a non-UID 0 user credential for lease management,
as that credential can change out from under us.  The server will
block NFSv4 lease recovery with NFS4ERR_CLID_INUSE.

Since the mechanism to acquire a credential for lease management
is now the same for all minor versions, replace the minor version-
specific callout with a single function.
