ASoC: add Renesas R-Car SCU feature

Renesas R-Car series sound circuit consists of SSI and its peripheral.
But this peripheral circuit is different between
R-Car Generation1 (E1/M1/H1) and Generation2 (E2/M2/H2)
(Actually, there are many difference in Generation1 chips)

This patch adds SCU feature on this driver.
But, it defines SCU style only, does nothing at this point.
