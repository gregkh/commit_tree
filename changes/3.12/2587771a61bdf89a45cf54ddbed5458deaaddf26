staging: dgnc: neo_uart_struct: adds marker and changes vars' types for sparse

This patch fixes these warnings found in the neo.c file:

warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
  expected void const volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
  got unsigned char volatile *<noident>
warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)
  expected void volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
  got unsigned char volatile *<noident>

The variables passed to readb and writeb need to
be of type u8 with a __iomem marker. These warnings
were popping up everytime the readb and writeb
functions were called with a neo_uart_struct variable.

The change made to the driver.h file adds the marker
to the neo_uart_struct and the changes in neo.h
changes the variables' types.
