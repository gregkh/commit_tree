Revert "usb: pl2303: add two comments concerning the supported baud rates with HX chips"

This reverts commit c23bda365dfbf56aa4d6d4a97f83136c36050e01.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
