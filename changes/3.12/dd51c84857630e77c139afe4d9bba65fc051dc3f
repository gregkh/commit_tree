apparmor: provide base for multiple profiles to be replaced at once

previously profiles had to be loaded one at a time, which could result
in cases where a replacement of a set would partially succeed, and then fail
resulting in inconsistent policy.

Allow multiple profiles to replaced "atomically" so that the replacement
either succeeds or fails for the entire set of profiles.
