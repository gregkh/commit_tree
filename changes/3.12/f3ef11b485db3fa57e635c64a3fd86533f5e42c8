regulator: wm831x-ldo: Fix max_uV for gp_ldo and aldo linear range settings

Fix the linear range settings in commit 5ff26a14c3331
"regulator: wm831x-ldo: Convert to use linear ranges".

For wm831x_gp_ldo:
We have below equations for list voltage before converting to linear ranges:

sel <= 0xe:
        volt = 0.9-1.6V in 50mV steps
sel <= 0x1f:
        volt = 1.7-3.3V in 100mV steps

max_uV for the first linear range should be 1600000 rather than 1650000. Fix it.

For wm831x_aldo:
We have below equations for list voltage before converting to linear ranges:

sel <= 0xc:
        volt = 1-1.6V in 50mV steps
sel <= 0x1f
        volt = 1.7-3.5V in 100mV steps

max_uV for the first linear range should be 1600000 rather than 1650000. Fix it.
