xfs: Initialize all quota inodes to be NULLFSINO

mkfs doesn't initialize the quota inodes to NULLFSINO as it does for the
other internal inodes. This leads to two in-core values (0 and NULLFSINO)
to be checked against, to make sure if a quota inode is valid.

Solve that problem by initializing the in-core values of all quotaino
values to NULLFSINO if they are 0 in the disk.

Note that these values are not written back to on-disk superblock unless
some quota is enabled on the filesystem. Even in that case sb_pquotino is
written to disk only if the on-disk superblock supports pquotino
