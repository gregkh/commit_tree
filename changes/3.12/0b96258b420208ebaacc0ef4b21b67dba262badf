clocksource: samsung_pwm_timer: Handle suspend/resume correctly

Current suspend/resume handling of the driver was broken, because:
 - periodic timer was being enabled in CLOCK_EVT_MODE_RESUME mode, which
   does not seem to be correct behavior looking at other platforms,
 - PWM divisors need to be restored, but they were not,
 - clockevent interrupt mask needs to be restored, but it was not,
 - clocksource was being restored in clockevent resume callback.

This patch fixes issues mentioned above, making suspend/resume handling
in the driver correct.
