vfs: make d_path() get the root path under RCU

This avoids the spinlocks and refcounts in the d_path() sequence too
(used by /proc and various other entities).  See commit 8b19e34188a3 for
the equivalent getcwd() system call path.

And unlike getcwd(), d_path() doesn't copy the result to user space, so
I don't need to fear _that_ particular bug happening again.
