tty: Simplify flip buffer list with 0-sized sentinel

Use a 0-sized sentinel to avoid assigning the head ptr from
the driver side thread. This also eliminates testing head/tail
for NULL.

When the sentinel is first 'consumed' by the buffer work
(or by tty_buffer_flush()), it is detached from the list but not
freed nor added to the free list. Both buffer work and
tty_buffer_flush() continue to preserve at least 1 flip buffer
to which head & tail is pointed.
