tty/hvc_console: Add DTR/RTS callback to handle HUPCL control

Introduce a new callback to explicitly handle the HUPCL termios control flag.
This prepares for a follow-up commit for the hvc_iucv device driver to
improve handling when to drop an established network connection.

The callback naming is based on the recently added tty_port interface to
facilitate a potential refactoring of the hvc_console to use tty_port
functions.
