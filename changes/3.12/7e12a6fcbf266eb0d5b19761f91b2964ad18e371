Revert "usb: pl2303: do not round to the next nearest standard baud rate for the divisor based baud rate encoding method"

This reverts commit 75417d9f99f89ab241de69d7db15af5842b488c4.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
