net: qmi_wwan: add new Qualcomm devices

Adding the device list from the Windows driver description files
included with a new Qualcomm MDM9615 based device, "Alcatel-sbell
ASB TL131 TDD LTE", from China Mobile.  This device is tested
and verified to work.  The others are assumed to work based on
using the same Windows driver.

Many of these devices support multiple QMI/wwan ports, requiring
multiple interface matching entries.  All devices are composite,
providing a mix of one or more serial, storage or Android Debug
Brigde functions in addition to the wwan function.

This device list included an update of one previously known device,
which was incorrectly assumed to have a Gobi 2K layout.  This is
corrected.
