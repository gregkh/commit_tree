mm: memcg: use proper memcg in limit bypass

Commit 84235de394d9 ("fs: buffer: move allocation failure loop into the
allocator") allowed __GFP_NOFAIL allocations to bypass the limit if they
fail to reclaim enough memory for the charge.  But because the main test
case was on a 3.2-based system, the patch missed the fact that on newer
kernels the charge function needs to return root_mem_cgroup when
bypassing the limit, and not NULL.  This will corrupt whatever memory is
at NULL + percpu pointer offset.  Fix this quickly before problems are
reported.
