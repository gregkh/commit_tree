ACPI / scan: Change ordering of locks for device hotplug

Change the ordering of device hotplug locks in scan.c so that
acpi_scan_lock is always acquired after device_hotplug_lock.

This will make it possible to use device_hotplug_lock around some
code paths that acquire acpi_scan_lock safely (most importantly
system suspend and hibernation).  Apart from that, acpi_scan_lock
is platform-specific and device_hotplug_lock is general, so the
new ordering appears to be more appropriate from the overall
design viewpoint.
