kvm: optimize away THP checks in kvm_is_mmio_pfn()

The checks on PG_reserved in the page structure on head and tail pages
aren't necessary because split_huge_page wouldn't transfer the
PG_reserved bit from head to tail anyway.

This was a forward-thinking check done in the case PageReserved was
set by a driver-owned page mapped in userland with something like
remap_pfn_range in a VM_PFNMAP region, but using hugepmds (not
possible right now). It was meant to be very safe, but it's overkill
as it's unlikely split_huge_page could ever run without the driver
noticing and tearing down the hugepage itself.

And if a driver in the future will really want to map a reserved
hugepage in userland using an huge pmd it should simply take care of
marking all subpages reserved too to keep KVM safe. This of course
would require such a hypothetical driver to tear down the huge pmd
itself and splitting the hugepage itself, instead of relaying on
split_huge_page, but that sounds very reasonable, especially
considering split_huge_page wouldn't currently transfer the reserved
bit anyway.
