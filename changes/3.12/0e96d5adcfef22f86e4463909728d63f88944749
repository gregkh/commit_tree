cpuidle: Fix variable domains in get_typical_interval()

The menu governor uses a static function get_typical_interval() to
try to detect a repeating pattern of wakeups. The previous interval
durations are stored as an array of unsigned ints, but the arithmetic
in the function is performed exclusively as 64 bit values, even when
the value stored in a variable is known not to exceed unsigned int,
which may be smaller and more efficient on some platforms.

This patch changes the types of varibles used to store some
intermediates, the maximum and and the cutoff threshold to unsigned
ints. Average and standard deviation are still treated as 64 bit values,
even when the values are known to be within the domain of unsigned int,
to avoid casts to ensure correct integer promotion for arithmetic
operations.
