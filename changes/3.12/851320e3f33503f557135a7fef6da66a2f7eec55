ARM: dts: Fix muxing and regulator for wl12xx on the SDIO bus for pandaboard

Commit b42b9181 (ARM: OMAP2+: Remove board-omap4panda.c)
removed legacy booting in favor of device tree based booting
for pandaboard. That caused the WLAN to stop working as the
related .dts entries fell through the cracks.

The legacy muxing was setting pulls for GPIO 48 and 49, so let's
keep that behaviour for now to avoid further regressions for
BT and FM. Also input logic was enabled for MMC CLK line, but
I've verified that the input logic we don't need enabled for
CLK line as it's not bidirectional.

Also, we want to use non-removable instead of ti,non-removable
as the ti,non-removable also sets no_regulator_off_init which
is really not what we want as then wl12xx won't get powered
up and down which is needed for resetting it.

Note that looks like the WLAN interface fails to come up after
a warm reset, but that most likely was also happening with
the legacy booting and needs a separate fix.
