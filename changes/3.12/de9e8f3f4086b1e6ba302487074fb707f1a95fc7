macvlan: Move skb_clone check closer to call

Currently macvlan calls skb_clone in macvlan_broadcast but checks
for a NULL return in macvlan_broadcast_one instead.  This is
needlessly confusing and may lead to bugs introduced later.

This patch moves the error check to where the skb_clone call is.

The only other caller of macvlan_broadcast_one never passes in a
NULL value so it doesn't need the check either.
