mm: munlock: batch non-THP page isolation and munlock+putback using pagevec

Currently, munlock_vma_range() calls munlock_vma_page on each page in a
loop, which results in repeated taking and releasing of the lru_lock
spinlock for isolating pages one by one.  This patch batches the munlock
operations using an on-stack pagevec, so that isolation is done under
single lru_lock.  For THP pages, the old behavior is preserved as they
might be split while putting them into the pagevec.  After this patch, a
9% speedup was measured for munlocking a 56GB large memory area with THP
disabled.

A new function __munlock_pagevec() is introduced that takes a pagevec and:
1) It clears PageMlocked and isolates all pages under lru_lock.  Zone page
stats can be also updated using the variant which assumes disabled
interrupts.  2) It finishes the munlock and lru putback on all pages under
their lock_page.  Note that previously, lock_page covered also the
PageMlocked clearing and page isolation, but it is not needed for those
operations.
