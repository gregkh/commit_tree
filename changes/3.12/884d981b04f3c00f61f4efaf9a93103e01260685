crypto: nx - fix limits to sg lists for AES-CTR

This patch updates the nx-aes-ctr implementation to perform several
hyper calls if needed in order to always respect the length limits for
scatter/gather lists.

Two different limits are considered:

 - "ibm,max-sg-len": maximum number of bytes of each scatter/gather
   list.

 - "ibm,max-sync-cop":
    - The total number of bytes that a scatter/gather list can hold.
    - The maximum number of elements that a scatter/gather list can have.
