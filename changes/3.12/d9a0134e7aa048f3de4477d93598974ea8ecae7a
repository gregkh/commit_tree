iio: core: Avoid double minus in sysfs output

This patch fixes the issue with double minus in output when
reading channels from sysfs for IIO_VAL_INT_PLUS_MICRO and
IIO_VAL_INT_PLUS_NANO cases. Until this patch if val and val2
both are negatives output string contains "--" before
digits. It is result of "-%d..." in sprintf() format.
