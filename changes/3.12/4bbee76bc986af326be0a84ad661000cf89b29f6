initmpfs: move bdi setup from init_rootfs to init_ramfs

Even though ramfs hasn't got a backing device, commit e0bf68ddec4f ("mm:
bdi init hooks") added one anyway, and put the initialization in
init_rootfs() since that's the first user, leaving it out of init_ramfs()
to avoid duplication.

But initmpfs uses init_tmpfs() instead, so move the init into the
filesystem's init function, add a "once" guard to prevent duplicate
initialization, and call the filesystem init from rootfs init.

This goes part of the way to allowing ramfs to be built as a module.
