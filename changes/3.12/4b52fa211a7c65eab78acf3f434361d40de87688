ASoC: Call snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets() only once during card initialization

Each time snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets() is called it will instantiate all the
widgets and routes that have been added so far and then power them. Doing this
multiple times before the card is fully initialized and all widgets have been
added can cause unnecessary and even invalid power state transitions which can
result in extra register writes and and also might cause clicks and pops.
