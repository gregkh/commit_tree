staging: comedi: usbdux: tidy up usbdux_ao_cmd()

Rename the local variable used for the private data pointer to the
comedi "norm".

Remove the unnecessary sanity check of the private data pointer. This
function can only be called is the private data was allocated during
the attach.

Make sure an ao command is not already running and return -EBUSY.

Tidy up the exit path using goto to ensure that the semaphore is
released.
