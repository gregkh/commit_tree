kernel/smp.c: quit unconditionally enabling irqs in on_each_cpu_mask().

As in commit f21afc25f9ed ("smp.h: Use local_irq_{save,restore}() in
!SMP version of on_each_cpu()"), we don't want to enable irqs if they
are not already enabled.

I don't know of any bugs currently caused by this unconditional
local_irq_enable(), but I want to use this function in MIPS/OCTEON early
boot (when we have early_boot_irqs_disabled).  This also makes this
function have similar semantics to on_each_cpu() which is good in
itself.
