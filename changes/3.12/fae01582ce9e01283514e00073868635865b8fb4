mfd: twl4030-power: Staticize local functions

twl4030_power_configure_scripts(), twl4030_power_configure_resources(),
twl4030_power_probe() are used only in this file.

Fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/mfd/twl4030-power.c:496:5: warning: symbol 'twl4030_power_configure_scripts' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/mfd/twl4030-power.c:512:5: warning: symbol 'twl4030_power_configure_resources' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/mfd/twl4030-power.c:556:5: warning: symbol 'twl4030_power_probe' was not declared. Should it be static?
