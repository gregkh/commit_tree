zram: fix invalid memory access

[1] tried to fix invalid memory access on zram->disk but it didn't
fix properly because get_disk failed during module exit path.

Actually, we don't need to reset zram->disk's capacity to zero
in module exit path so that this patch introduces new argument
"reset_capacity" on zram_reset_divice and it only reset it when
reset_store is called.
