ARM: imx: clk-pllv3: improve the timeout waiting method

There are two improvements for this commit:

- Add comparing pll lock condition after while loop. It can
fix potential fake timeout problem caused by the code is just
scheduled out before compare the timeout, and the time of
scheduling out are more than one jiffies.

- Move timeout assignment more close to compare the timeout.
It can reduce the possibility the code is scheduled out, and
the timeout can be more precise.
