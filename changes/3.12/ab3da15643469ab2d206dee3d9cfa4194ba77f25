ARM: be strict about FP exceptions in kernel mode

The support code in vfp_support_entry does not care whether the
exception that caused it to be invoked occurred in kernel mode or
in user mode. However, neither condition that could trigger this
exception (lazy restore and VFP bounce to support code) is
currently allowable in kernel mode.

In either case, print a message describing the condition before
letting the undefined instruction handler run its course and trigger
an oops.
