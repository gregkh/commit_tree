staging: dgnc: neo.c: changes param in neo_read_eeprom function for sparse

This patch adds a marker to neo_read_eeprom function's
base parameter.

It removes these warnings found in neo.c:

warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
  expected unsigned char *base
  got unsigned char [noderef] [usertype] <asn:2>*re_map_membase
warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)
  expected void volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
  got unsigned char *

These warnings happen because this function gets
called with a board_t->re_map_base variable. A previous
patch added the __iomem marker to this variable. This
patch ensures that the changes are consistent.
