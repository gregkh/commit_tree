clk: fixup argument order when setting VCO parameters

The order of arguments in the call to vco_set() for the ICST clocks appears to
have been switched in error, which results in the VCO not being initialised
correctly. This in turn stops the integrated LCD on things like Integrator/CP
from working correctly.

This patch fixes the order and restores the expected functionality.
