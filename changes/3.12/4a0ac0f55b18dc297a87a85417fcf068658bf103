OMAP: add RS485 support

This patch adds RS485 support to the OMAP serial driver, as
defined in:-

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/rs485.txt

When a UART transmitter is connected to (eg) a RS485 driver, it is
necessary to turn the driver on/off as quickly as possible.  This is
best achieved in the serial driver itself (rather than in userspace
where the latency can be quite large).

This patch allows a GPIO pin to be defined (via DT) that controls
the enabling of the driver at the start of a message, and disables
the driver when the message has been completed.

When RS485 is disabled, the RTS pin is set to on.
