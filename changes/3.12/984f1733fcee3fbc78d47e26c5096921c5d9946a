[SCSI] sd: Fix potential out-of-bounds access

This patch fixes an out-of-bounds error in sd_read_cache_type(), found
by Google's AddressSanitizer tool.  When the loop ends, we know that
"offset" lies beyond the end of the data in the buffer, so no Caching
mode page was found.  In theory it may be present, but the buffer size
is limited to 512 bytes.
