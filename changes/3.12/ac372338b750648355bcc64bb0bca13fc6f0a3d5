ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Refactor slot allocation code in register_slot()

To make the code in register_slot() a bit easier to follow, change
the way the slot allocation part is organized.  Drop one local
variable that's not used any more after that modification.

This code change should not lead to any changes in behavior.
