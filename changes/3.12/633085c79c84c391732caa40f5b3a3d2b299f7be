Btrfs: reset force_compress on btrfs_file_defrag failure

After we set force_compress with a new value (which was not being done
while holding the inode mutex), if an error happens and we jump to
the label out_ra, the force_compress property of the inode is not set
to BTRFS_COMPRESS_NONE (unlike in the case where no errors happen).
