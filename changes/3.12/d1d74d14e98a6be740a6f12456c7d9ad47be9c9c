rcu: Expedite grace periods during suspend/resume

CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ can increase grace-period durations by up to
a factor of four, which can result in long suspend and resume times.
Thus, this commit temporarily switches to expedited grace periods when
suspending the box and return to normal settings when resuming.  Similar
logic is applied to hibernation.

Because expedited grace periods are of dubious benefit on very large
systems, so this commit restricts their automated use during suspend
and resume to systems of 256 or fewer CPUs.  (Some day a number of
Linux-kernel facilities, including RCU's expedited grace periods,
will be more scalable, but I need to see bug reports first.)

[ paulmck: This also papers over an audio/irq bug, but hopefully that will
  be fixed soon. ]
