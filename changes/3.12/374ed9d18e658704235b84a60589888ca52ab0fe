arm64: documentation: tighten up tagged pointer documentation

Commit d50240a5f6ce ("arm64: mm: permit use of tagged pointers at EL0")
added support for tagged pointers in userspace, but the corresponding
update to Documentation/ contained some imprecise statements.

This patch fixes up some minor ambiguities in the text, hopefully making
it more clear about exactly what the kernel expects from user virtual
addresses.
