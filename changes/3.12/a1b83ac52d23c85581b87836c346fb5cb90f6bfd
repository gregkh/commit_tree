btrfs: fix get set label blocking against balance

btrfs_ioctl_get_fslabel() and btrfs_ioctl_set_fslabel()
used root->fs_info->volume_mutex mutex which caused operations
like balance to block set/get label operation until its
completion and generally balance operation takes a long
time to complete, so it will be annoying to the user when
cli appears hung

also this patch will add a bit of optimization within
the btrfs_ioctl_get_falabel() function.

v1->v2:
   use fs_info->super_lock instead of uuid_mutex
