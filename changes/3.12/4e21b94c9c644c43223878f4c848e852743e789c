powerpc/85xx: Move ePAPR paravirt initialization earlier

At console init, when the kernel tries to flush the log buffer
the ePAPR byte-channel based console write fails silently,
losing the buffered messages.
This happens because The ePAPR para-virtualization init isn't
done early enough so that the hcall instruction to be set,
causing the byte-channel write hcall to be a nop.
To fix, change the ePAPR para-virt init to use early device
tree functions and move it in early init.
