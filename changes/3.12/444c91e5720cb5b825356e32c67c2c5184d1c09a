of: fix unnecessary warning on missing /cpus node

Not all DT platforms have all the cpus collected under a /cpus node.
That just happens to be a details of FDT, ePAPR and PowerPC platforms.
Sparc does something different, but unfortunately the current code
complains with a warning if /cpus isn't there. This became a problem
with commit f86e4718, "driver/core cpu: initialize of_node in cpu's
device structure", which caused the function to get called for all
architectures.

This commit is a temporary fix to fail silently if the cpus node isn't
present. A proper fix will come later to allow arch code to provide a
custom mechanism for decoding the CPU hwid if the 'reg' property isn't
appropriate.
