NTB: Update Device IDs

Add support for new Intel NTB devices on upcoming Xeon hardware.  Since
the Xeon hardware design is already in place in the driver, all that is
needed are the new device ids.

Remove the device IDs for NTB devs running in Transparent Bridge mode,
as this driver is not being used for those devices.

Rename the device IDs for NTB devs running in NTB-RP mode to better
identify their usage model.  "PS" to denote the Primary Side of NTB, and
"SS" to denote the secondary side.  The primary side is the interface
exposed to the local system, and the secondary side is the interface
exposed to the remote system.
