net: sctp: sctp_verify_init: clean up mandatory checks and add comment

Add a comment related to RFC4960 explaning why we do not check for initial
TSN, and while at it, remove yoda notation checks and clean up code from
checks of mandatory conditions. That's probably just really minor, but makes
reviewing easier.
