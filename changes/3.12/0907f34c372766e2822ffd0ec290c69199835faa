bnx2x: Fix config when SR-IOV and iSCSI are enabled

Starting with commit b9871bc "bnx2x: VF RSS support - PF side", if a PF will
have SR-IOV supported in its PCI configuration space, storage drivers will not
work for that interface.

This patch fixes the resource calculation to allow such a configuration to
properly work.
