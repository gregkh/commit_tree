ASoC: dapm: Keep a list of paths per kcontrol

Currently we store for each path which control (if any at all) is associated
with that control. But we are only ever interested in the reverse relationship,
i.e. we want to know all the paths a certain control is associated with. This is
currently implemented by always iterating over all paths. This patch updates the
code to keep a list for each control which contains all the paths that are
associated with that control. This improves the run time of e.g.
soc_dapm_mixer_update_power() and soc_dapm_mux_update_power() from O(n) (with n
being the number of paths for the card) to O(1).
