staging/lustre: fix 'data race condition' issues in at_reset()

Fix 'data race condition' defects found by Coverity version
6.5.0:
Data race condition (MISSING_LOCK)
Accessing variable without holding lock. Elsewhere,
this variable is accessed with lock held.

at_reset() needs to take at->at_lock before modifying its members.
