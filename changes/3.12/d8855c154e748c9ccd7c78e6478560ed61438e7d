target: Fix recursive COMPARE_AND_WRITE callback failure

This patch addresses a bug when compare_and_write_callback() invoked from
target_complete_ok_work() hits an failure from __target_execute_cmd() ->
cmd->execute_cmd(), that ends up calling transport_generic_request_failure()
-> compare_and_write_post(), thus causing SCF_COMPARE_AND_WRITE_POST to
incorrectly be set.

The result of this bug is that target_complete_ok_work() no longer hits
the if (!rc && !(cmd->se_cmd_flags & SCF_COMPARE_AND_WRITE_POST) check
that forces an immediate return, and instead double completes the se_cmd
in question, triggering an OOPs in the process.

This patch changes compare_and_write_post() to only set this bit when a
failure has not already occured to ensure the immediate return from within
target_complete_ok_work(), and thus allow transport_generic_request_failure()
to handle the sending of the CHECK_CONDITION exception status.
