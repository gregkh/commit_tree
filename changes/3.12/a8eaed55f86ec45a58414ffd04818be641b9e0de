tile: set hw_features and vlan_features in setup

This change allows the user to configure various features of the tile
networking drivers on and off.  There is no change to the default
initialization state of either the tilegx or tilepro drivers.

Neither driver needs the ndo_fix_features or ndo_set_features callbacks,
since the generic code already handles the dependencies for
fix_features, and there is no hardware state to tweak in set_features.
