powerpc: Unaligned stores and stmw are broken in emulation code

The stmw instruction was incorrectly decoded as an update form instruction
and thus the RA register was being clobbered.

Also, the utility routine to write memory to unaligned addresses breaks the
operation into smaller aligned accesses but was incorrectly incrementing
the address by only one; it needs to increment the address by the size of
the smaller aligned chunk.
