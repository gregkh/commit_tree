s390: fix system call restart after inferior call

Git commit 616498813b11ffef "s390: system call path micro optimization"
introduced a regression in regard to system call restarting and inferior
function calls via the ptrace interface. The pointer to the system call
table needs to be loaded in sysc_sigpending if do_signal returns with
TIF_SYSCALl set after it restored a system call context.
