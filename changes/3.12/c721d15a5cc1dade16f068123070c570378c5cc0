cpufreq: exynos5440: Fix to skip when new frequency same as current

This patch fixes the issue of un-necessary setting the clock controller
when the new target frequency is same as the current one. This case usually
occurs with governors like ondemand which passes the target frequency as the
percentage of average frequency. This check is present in most of the cpufreq
drivers.
