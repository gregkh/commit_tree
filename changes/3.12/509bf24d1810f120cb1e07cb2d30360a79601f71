CacheFiles: Don't try to dump the index key if the cookie has been cleared

Don't try to dump the index key that distinguishes an object if netfs
data in the cookie the object refers to has been cleared (ie.  the
cookie has passed most of the way through
__fscache_relinquish_cookie()).

Since the netfs holds the index key, we can't get at it once the ->def
and ->netfs_data pointers have been cleared - and a NULL pointer
exception will ensue, usually just after a:

	CacheFiles: Error: Unexpected object collision

error is reported.
