fbdev: simplefb: add init through platform_data

If we create proper platform-devices in x86 boot-code, we can use simplefb
for VBE or EFI framebuffers, too. However, there is normally no OF support
so we introduce a platform_data object so x86 boot-code can pass the
parameters via plain old platform-data.

This also removes the OF dependency as it is not needed. The headers
provide proper dummies for the case OF is disabled.

Furthermore, we move the FORMAT-definitions to the common platform header
so initialization code can use it to transform "struct screen_info" to
the right format-name.
