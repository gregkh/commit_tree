PCI: Look for unassigned resources on per-bus basis

When CONFIG_PCI_REALLOC_ENABLE_AUTO=y, pci_realloc_detect() looks at PCI
devices to see if any have SR-IOV resources that need to be assigned.  If
it finds any, it turns on automatic resource reallocation.

This patch changes pci_realloc_detect() so it uses pci_walk_bus() on
each root bus instead of using for_each_pci_dev().  This is a step
toward doing reallocation on a per-bus basis, so we can do it for
a hot-added host bridge.
