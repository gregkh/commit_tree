ASoC: dapm: Add a helper to get the CODEC for DAPM kcontrol

We use the same 3 lines to get the CODEC for a kcontrol in a quite a few places.
This patch puts them into a common helper function. Having this encapsulated in
a helper function will also make it more easier to eventually change the data
layout of the kcontrol's private data.
