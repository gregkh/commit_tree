Btrfs: allow compressed extents to be merged during defragment

The rule originally comes from nocow writing, but snapshot-aware
defrag is a different case, the extent has been writen and we're
not going to change the extent but add a reference on the data.

So we're able to allow such compressed extents to be merged into
one bigger extent if they're pointing to the same data.
