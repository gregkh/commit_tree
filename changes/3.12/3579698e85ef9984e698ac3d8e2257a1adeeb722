clocksource: armada-370-xp: Simplify TIMER_CTRL register access

This commit creates two functions to access the TIMER_CTRL register:
one for global one for the per-cpu. This makes the code much more
readable. In addition, since the TIMER_CTRL register is also used for
watchdog, this is preparation work for future thread-safe improvements.
