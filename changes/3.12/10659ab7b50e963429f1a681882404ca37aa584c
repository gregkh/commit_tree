cpufreq: Avoid double kobject_put() for the same kobject in error code path

The only case triggering a jump to the err_out_unregister label in
__cpufreq_add_dev() is when cpufreq_add_dev_interface() fails.
However, if cpufreq_add_dev_interface() fails, it calls kobject_put()
for the policy kobject in its error code path and since that causes
the kobject's refcount to become 0, the additional kobject_put() for
the same kobject under err_out_unregister and the
wait_for_completion() following it are pointless, so drop them.
