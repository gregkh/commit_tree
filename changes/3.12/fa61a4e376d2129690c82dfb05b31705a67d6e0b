powerpc/kvm: Contiguous memory allocator based hash page table allocation

Powerpc architecture uses a hash based page table mechanism for mapping virtual
addresses to physical address. The architecture require this hash page table to
be physically contiguous. With KVM on Powerpc currently we use early reservation
mechanism for allocating guest hash page table. This implies that we need to
reserve a big memory region to ensure we can create large number of guest
simultaneously with KVM on Power. Another disadvantage is that the reserved memory
is not available to rest of the subsystems and and that implies we limit the total
available memory in the host.

This patch series switch the guest hash page table allocation to use
contiguous memory allocator.
