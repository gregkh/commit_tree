fs/9p: avoid accessing utsname after namespace has been torn down

During trinity fuzzing in a kvmtool guest, I stumbled across the
following:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
PC is at v9fs_file_do_lock+0xc8/0x1a0

I believe this is due to an attempt to access utsname()->nodename, after
exit_task_namespaces() has been called, leaving current->nsproxy->uts_ns
as NULL and causing the above dereference.

A similar issue was fixed for lockd in 9a1b6bf818e7 ("LOCKD: Don't call
utsname()->nodename from nlmclnt_setlockargs"), so this patch attempts
something similar for 9pfs.
