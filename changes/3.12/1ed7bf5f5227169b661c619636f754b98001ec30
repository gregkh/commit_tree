xen, pvticketlock: Allow interrupts to be enabled while blocking

If interrupts were enabled when taking the spinlock, we can leave them
enabled while blocking to get the lock.

If we can enable interrupts while waiting for the lock to become
available, and we take an interrupt before entering the poll,
and the handler takes a spinlock which ends up going into
the slow state (invalidating the per-cpu "lock" and "want" values),
then when the interrupt handler returns the event channel will
remain pending so the poll will return immediately, causing it to
return out to the main spinlock loop.
