Btrfs: introduce uuid-tree-gen field

In order to be able to detect the case that a filesystem is mounted
with an old kernel, add a uuid-tree-gen field like the free space
cache is doing it. It is part of the super block and written with
each commit. Old kernels do not know this field and don't update it.
