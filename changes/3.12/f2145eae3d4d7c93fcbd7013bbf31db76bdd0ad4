staging/lustre/dlmlock: compress out unused space

* lustre/include/lustre_dlm.h: Remove all bit fields and the unused
  weighing callback procedure.  respell LDLM_AST_DISCARD_DATA as
  LDLM_FL_AST_DISCARD_DATA to match other flags.
* .gitignore: ignore emacs temporary files
* autogen.sh: rebuild the lock bits, if autogen is available.
* contrib/bit-masks/lustre_dlm_flags.def: define the ldlm_lock flags
* contrib/bit-masks/lustre_dlm_flags.tpl: template for emitting text
* contrib/bit-masks/Makefile: construct the .c and .h files
  The .c file is for constructing a crash extension and is not
  preserved.
* contrib/bit-masks/.gitignore: ignore built products
* lustre/contrib/wireshark/packet-lustre.c: use built files instead
  of local versions of the defines.

In the rest of the modified sources, replace flag field references
with bit mask references.

* lustre/osc/osc_lock.c: removed osc_lock_weigh, too
