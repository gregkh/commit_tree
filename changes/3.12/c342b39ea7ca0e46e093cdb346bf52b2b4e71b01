igb: Add macro for size of RETA indirection table

RETA indirection table is used to assign the received data to a CPU
in order to maintain an efficient distribution of network receive
processing across multiple CPUs.

This patch removes the hard-coded value for the size of the indirection
table and defines a new macro.
