dm cache: fix stacking of geometry limits

Do not blindly override the queue limits (specifically io_min and
io_opt).  Allow traditional stacking of these limits if io_opt is a
factor of the cache's data block size.

Without this patch mkfs.xfs does not recognize the cache device's
provided limits as a useful geometry (e.g. raid) so these hints are
ignored.  This was due to setting io_min to a useless value.
