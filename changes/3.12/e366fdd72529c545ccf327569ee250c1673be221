clk: clk-mux: implement remuxing on set_rate

Implement clk-mux remuxing if the CLK_SET_RATE_NO_REPARENT flag isn't
set. This implements determine_rate for clk-mux to propagate to each
parent and to choose the best one (like clk-divider this chooses the
parent which provides the fastest rate <= the requested rate).

The determine_rate op is implemented as a core helper function so that
it can be easily used by more complex clocks which incorporate muxes.
