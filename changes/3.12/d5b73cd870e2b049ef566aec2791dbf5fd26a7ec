cpufreq: Use sizeof(*ptr) convetion for computing sizes

Chapter 14 of Documentation/CodingStyle says:

The preferred form for passing a size of a struct is the following:

	p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...);

The alternative form where struct name is spelled out hurts
readability and introduces an opportunity for a bug when the pointer
variable type is changed but the corresponding sizeof that is passed
to a memory allocator is not.

This wasn't followed consistently in drivers/cpufreq, let's make it
more consistent by always following this rule.
