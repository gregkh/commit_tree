hugepage: mention libhugetlbfs in doc

Explicitly mention/recommend using the libhugetlbfs test cases when
changing related kernel code.  Developers that are unaware of the project
can easily miss this and introduce potential regressions that may or may
not be caught by community review.

Also do some cleanups that make the document visually easier to view at a
first glance.
