usb: host: add Kconfig option for EHSET

commit 9841f37a1c ("usb: ehci: Add support for SINGLE_STEP_SET_FEATURE
test of EHSET") added additional code to the EHCI hub driver but it is
anticipated to only have a limited audience (e.g. embedded silicon
vendors and integrators). Avoid subjecting all EHCI (and in the future
maybe xHCI/OHCI, etc.) HCD users to code bloat by conditionally
compiling the EHSET-specific additions with a new Kconfig option,
CONFIG_USB_HCD_TEST_MODE.
