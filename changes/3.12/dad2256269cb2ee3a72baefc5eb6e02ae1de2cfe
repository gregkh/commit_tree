mtd: nand: remove NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY

NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY is a strange, badly-supported option with omap as its
single remaining user.

NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY was likely used by accident in omap2[1]. And anyway,
omap2 doesn't scan the chip for bad blocks (courtesy of
NAND_SKIP_BBTSCAN), and so its use of this option is irrelevant.

This patch drops the NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY option.
