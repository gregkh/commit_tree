cgroup: implement CFTYPE_NO_PREFIX

When cgroup files are created, cgroup core automatically prepends the
name of the subsystem as prefix.  This patch adds CFTYPE_NO_ which
disables the automatic prefix.  This is to work around historical
baggages and shouldn't be used for new files.

This will be used to move "cgroup.event_control" from cgroup core to
memcg.
