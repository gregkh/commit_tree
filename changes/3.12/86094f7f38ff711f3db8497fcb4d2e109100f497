sfc: Move and rename Falcon/Siena common NIC operations

Add efx_nic_type operations for the many efx_nic functions that need
to be implemented different on EF10.  For now, change most of the
existing efx_nic_*() functions into inline wrappers.  As a later step,
we may be able to improve branch prediction for operations used on the
fast path by copying the pointers into each queue/channel structure.

Move the Falcon/Siena implementations to new file farch.c and rename
the functions and static data to use a prefix of 'efx_farch_'.

Move efx_may_push_tx_desc() to nic.h, as the EF10 TX code will also
use it.
