serial: st-asc: replace devm_request_and_ioremap by devm_ioremap_resource

Use devm_ioremap_resource instead of devm_request_and_ioremap.

This was done using the semantic patch
scripts/coccinelle/api/devm_ioremap_resource.cocci
and various manual modifications to move associated calls to
platform_get_resource closer to the resulting call to devm_ioremap_resource
and to remove the associated error handling code.

The initialization of port->mapbase is also moved lower, to take advantage
of the NULL test on res performed by devm_ioremap_resource.
