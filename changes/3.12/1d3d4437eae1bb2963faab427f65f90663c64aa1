vmscan: per-node deferred work

The list_lru infrastructure already keeps per-node LRU lists in its
node-specific list_lru_node arrays and provide us with a per-node API, and
the shrinkers are properly equiped with node information.  This means that
we can now focus our shrinking effort in a single node, but the work that
is deferred from one run to another is kept global at nr_in_batch.  Work
can be deferred, for instance, during direct reclaim under a GFP_NOFS
allocation, where situation, all the filesystem shrinkers will be
prevented from running and accumulate in nr_in_batch the amount of work
they should have done, but could not.

This creates an impedance problem, where upon node pressure, work deferred
will accumulate and end up being flushed in other nodes.  The problem we
describe is particularly harmful in big machines, where many nodes can
accumulate at the same time, all adding to the global counter nr_in_batch.
 As we accumulate more and more, we start to ask for the caches to flush
even bigger numbers.  The result is that the caches are depleted and do
not stabilize.  To achieve stable steady state behavior, we need to tackle
it differently.

In this patch we keep the deferred count per-node, in the new array
nr_deferred[] (the name is also a bit more descriptive) and will never
accumulate that to other nodes.
