tpm: xen-tpmfront: Fix default durations

All the default durations were being set to 10 minutes which is
way too long for the timeouts. Normal values for the longest
duration are around 5 mins, and short duration ar around .5s.

Further, these are just the default, tpm_get_timeouts will set
them to values from the TPM (or throw an error).

Just remove them.
