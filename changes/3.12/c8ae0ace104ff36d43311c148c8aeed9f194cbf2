KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Load up SPRG3 register with guest value on guest entry

Unlike the other general-purpose SPRs, SPRG3 can be read by usermode
code, and is used in recent kernels to store the CPU and NUMA node
numbers so that they can be read by VDSO functions.  Thus we need to
load the guest's SPRG3 value into the real SPRG3 register when entering
the guest, and restore the host's value when exiting the guest.  We don't
need to save the guest SPRG3 value when exiting the guest as usermode
code can't modify SPRG3.
