e1000e: Avoid kernel crash during shutdown

While doing shutdown on the PCI device, the corresponding callback
function e1000e_shutdown() is trying to clear those correctable
errors on the upstream P2P bridge. Unfortunately, we don't have
the upstream P2P bridge under some cases (e.g. PCI-passthrou for
KVM on Power). That leads to kernel crash eventually.

The patch adds one more check on that to avoid kernel crash.
