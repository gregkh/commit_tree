dma: replace devm_request_and_ioremap by devm_ioremap_resource

Use devm_ioremap_resource instead of devm_request_and_ioremap.

This was done using the semantic patch
scripts/coccinelle/api/devm_ioremap_resource.cocci

The relevant call to platform_get_resource was manually moved down to the
call to devm_ioremap_resource.
