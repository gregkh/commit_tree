dmaengine: sirf: add PM entries for sleep and runtime

this patch adds PM ops entries in sirf-dma drivers, so that this
driver can support suspend/resume, hibernation and runtime PM.

while suspending, sirf-dma will lose all registers, so we save
them at suspend and restore in resume for active channels.
