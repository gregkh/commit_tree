mm/hwpoison: don't need to hold compound lock for hugetlbfs page

compound lock is introduced by commit e9da73d67("thp: compound_lock."), it
is used to serialize put_page against __split_huge_page_refcount().  In
addition, transparent hugepages will be splitted in hwpoison handler and
just one subpage will be poisoned.  There is unnecessary to hold compound
lock for hugetlbfs page.  This patch replace compound_trans_order by
compond_order in the place where the page is hugetlbfs page.
