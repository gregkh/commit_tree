ASoC: dapm: Delay w->power update until the changes are written

Wait with updating the widgets power field until the changes are actually
written to the hardware in dapm_seq_run_coalesced(). This will allow us to query
the current hardware state between calling dapm_power_one_widget() and actually
writing the new power state to hardware.
