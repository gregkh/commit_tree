drm: disallow legacy sg ioctls for modesetting drivers

Only the radeon/r128/ati ums drivers use this. Furthermore the cleanup
was already only done for UMS drivers. Also a quick check of the ATI
ddx git history shows that only the UMS code ever used this facility.

So we can safely disallow these pair of ioctls for modesetting
drivers.
