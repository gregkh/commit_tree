x86, pvticketlock: When paravirtualizing ticket locks, increment by 2

Increment ticket head/tails by 2 rather than 1 to leave the LSB free
to store a "is in slowpath state" bit.  This halves the number
of possible CPUs for a given ticket size, but this shouldn't matter
in practice - kernels built for 32k+ CPU systems are probably
specially built for the hardware rather than a generic distro
kernel.
