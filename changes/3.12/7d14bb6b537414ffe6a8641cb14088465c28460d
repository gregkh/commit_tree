drm: don't call ->firstopen for KMS drivers

It has way too much potential for driver writers to do stupid things
like delayed hw setup because the load sequence is somehow racy (e.g.
the imx driver in staging). So don't call it for modesetting drivers,
which reduces the complexity of the drm core -> driver interface a
notch.

v2: Don't forget to update DocBook.

v3: Go with Laurent's slightly more elaborate proposal for the DocBook
update. Add a few words on top of his diff to elaborate a bit on what
KMS drivers should and shouldn't do in lastclose. There was already a
paragraph present talking about restoring properties, I've simply
extended that one.
