ARM: sa1100: collie.c: fall back to jedec_probe flash detection

Zaurus collie contains 2 LH28F640BFHE-PTTL90 (64M 4Mx16) and
at the moment cfi will not detect the collie NOR.
In the meanwhile we can revert to the jedec-probe map which has been
fixed with following commit:

mtd: jedec_probe: fix LH28F640BF definition
fe2f4c8e0bf2756b670ee78fa9772613a2ea8495

Somehow this is unsatisfactory because the flash is mounted READ ONLY
(as from factory, with a RO cramfs)
