perf tools: Make it possible to read object code from vmlinux

The new "object code reading" test shows that it is not possible to read
object code from vmlinux.  That is because the mappings do not map to
the dso.  This patch fixes that.

A side-effect of changing the kernel map is that the "reloc" offset must
be taken into account.  As a result of that separate map functions for
relocation are no longer needed.

Also fixing up the maps to match the symbols no longer makes sense and
so is not done.

The vmlinux dso data_type is now set to either DSO_BINARY_TYPE__VMLINUX
or DSO_BINARY_TYPE__GUEST_VMLINUX as approprite, which enables the
correct file name to be determined by dso__binary_type_file().

This patch breaks the "vmlinux symtab matches kallsyms" test.  That is
fixed in a following patch.
