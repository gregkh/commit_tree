lockref: use cmpxchg64 explicitly for lockless updates

The cmpxchg() function tends not to support 64-bit arguments on 32-bit
architectures.  This could be either due to use of unsigned long
arguments (like on ARM) or lack of instruction support (cmpxchgq on
x86).  However, these architectures may implement a specific cmpxchg64()
function to provide 64-bit cmpxchg support instead.

Since the lockref code requires a 64-bit cmpxchg and relies on the
architecture selecting ARCH_USE_CMPXCHG_LOCKREF, move to using cmpxchg64
instead of cmpxchg and allow 32-bit architectures to make use of the
lockless lockref implementation.
