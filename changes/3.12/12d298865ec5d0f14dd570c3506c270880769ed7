clk: only call get_parent if there is one

In __clk_init(), after a clock is mostly initialized, a scan is done
of the orphan clocks to see if the clock being registered is the
parent of any of them.

This code assumes that any clock that provides a get_parent method
actually has at least one parent, and that's not a valid assumption.

As a result, an orphan clock with no parent can return *something*
as the parent index, and that value is blindly used to dereference
the orphan's parent_names[] array (which will be ZERO_SIZE_PTR or
NULL).

Fix this by ensuring get_parent is only called for orphans with at
least one parent.
