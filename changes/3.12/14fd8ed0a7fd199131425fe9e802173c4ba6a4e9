ARM: mvebu: Relocate Armada 370/XP PCIe device tree nodes

Now that mbus has been added to the device tree, it's possible to
move the PCIe nodes out of internal registers, placing it directly
below the mbus. This is a more accurate representation of the
hardware.

Moving the PCIe nodes, we now need to introduce an extra cell to
encode the window target ID and attribute. Since this depends on
the PCIe port, we split the ranges translation entries, to correspond
to each MBus window.
