MAINTAINERS: add overall IOMMU section

I believe that Joerg Roedel is at least the path through which
drivers/iommu changes should be merged. Add a MAINTAINERS entry to
make this clear, so that he's Cd'd on all relevant patches. This is
relevant for non-AMD/Intel IOMMUs, where get_maintainers.pl doesn't
currently remind anyone to Cc Joerg on patches.
