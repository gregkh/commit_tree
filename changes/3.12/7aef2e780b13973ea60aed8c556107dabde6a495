block: trace all devices plug operation

In func blk_queue_bio, if list of plug is empty,it will call
blk_trace_plug.
If process deal with a single device,it't ok.But if process deal with
multi devices,it only trace the first device.
Using request_count to judge, it can soleve this problem.

In addition, i modify the comment.
