ARM: OMAP: 4430SDP: remove picodlp device data

4430SDP board has an option for a PicoDLP mini-projector. PicoDLP cannot
be used at the same time as the second LCD, and there are GPIOs that
need to be set/unset when changing the used display.

Managing that kind of board specific setup is not simple without board
file callbacks. As only some 4430SDP boards actually have the PicoDLP
installed, and 4430SDP boards are not that common in the first place,
let's remove PicoDLP data from the board file.
