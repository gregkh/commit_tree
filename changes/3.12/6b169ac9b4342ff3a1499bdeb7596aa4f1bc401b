s390/kprobes: add support for compare and branch instructions

The compare and branch instructions (not relative) all need special
handling when kprobed:
- if a branch was taken, the instruction pointer should be left alone
- if a branch was not taken, the instruction pointer must be adjusted

The compare and branch instructions family was introduced with the general
instruction extension facility (z10).
