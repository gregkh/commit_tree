tile: add virt_to_kpte() API and clean up and document behavior

We use virt_to_pte(NULL, va) a lot, which isn't very obvious.
I added virt_to_kpte(va) as a more obvious wrapper function,
that also validates the va as being a kernel adddress.

And, I fixed the semantics of virt_to_pte() so that we handle
the pud and pmd the same way, and we now document the fact that
we handle the final pte level differently.
