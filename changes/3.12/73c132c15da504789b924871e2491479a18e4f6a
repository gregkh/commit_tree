ARM: add support for kernel mode NEON

In order to safely support the use of NEON instructions in
kernel mode, some precautions need to be taken:
- the userland context that may be present in the registers (even
  if the NEON/VFP is currently disabled) must be stored under the
  correct task (which may not be 'current' in the UP case),
- to avoid having to keep track of additional vfpstates for the
  kernel side, disallow the use of NEON in interrupt context
  and run with preemption disabled,
- after use, re-enable preemption and re-enable the lazy restore
  machinery by disabling the NEON/VFP unit.

This patch adds the functions kernel_neon_begin() and
kernel_neon_end() which take care of the above. It also adds
the Kconfig symbol KERNEL_MODE_NEON to enable it.
