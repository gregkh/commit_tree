drm/rcar-du: Introduce CRTCs groups

The R8A7779 DU is split in per-CRTC resources (scan-out engine, blending
unit, timings generator, ...) and device-global resources (start/stop
control, planes, ...) shared between the two CRTCs.

The R8A7790 introduced a third CRTC with its own set of global resources
This would be modeled as two separate DU device instances if it wasn't
for a handful or resources that are shared between the three CRTCs
(mostly related to input and output routing). For this reason the
R8A7790 DU must be modeled as a single device with three CRTCs, two sets
of "semi-global" resources, and a few device-global resources.

Introduce a new rcar_du_group driver-specific object, without any real
counterpart in the DU documentation, that models those semi-global
resources.
