RPCSEC_GSS: Fix an Oopsable condition when creating/destroying pipefs objects

If an error condition occurs on rpc_pipefs creation, or the user mounts
rpc_pipefs and then unmounts it, then the dentries in struct gss_auth
need to be reset to NULL so that a second call to gss_pipes_dentries_destroy
doesn't try to free them again.
