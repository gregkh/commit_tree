staging/lustre/llite: Anonymous dentry incorrectly identified as root

When exporting Lustre via NFS on SLES11SP2, this check incorrectly identifies
anonymous dentries as root dentries.  This is due to a change in SLES11SP2
which makes the d_name.name for anonymous dentries the same as that for root
dentries.  (Details in LU-3484.)

This changes the check to directly compare the value of the dentry pointer
to the root dentry pointer found in the superblock, rather than using the name.
