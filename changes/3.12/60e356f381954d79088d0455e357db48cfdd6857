dm-snapshot: fix performance degradation due to small hash size

LVM2, since version 2.02.96, creates origin with zero size, then loads
the snapshot driver and then loads the origin.  Consequently, the
snapshot driver sees the origin size zero and sets the hash size to the
lower bound 64.  Such small hash table causes performance degradation.

This patch changes it so that the hash size is determined by the size of
snapshot volume, not minimum of origin and snapshot size.  It doesn't
make sense to set the snapshot size significantly larger than the origin
size, so we do not need to take origin size into account when
calculating the hash size.
