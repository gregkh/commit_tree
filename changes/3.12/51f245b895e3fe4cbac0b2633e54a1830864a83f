cpuidle: Change struct menu_device field types

Field predicted_us value can never exceed expected_us value, but it has
a potentially larger type. As there is no need for additional 32 bits of
zeroes on 32 bit plaforms, change the type of predicted_us to match the
type of expected_us.

Field correction_factor is used to store a value that cannot exceed the
product of RESOLUTION and DECAY (default 1024*8 = 8192). The constants
cannot in practice be incremented to such values, that they'd overflow
unsigned int even on 32 bit systems, so the type is changed to avoid
unnecessary 64 bit arithmetic on 32 bit systems.

One multiplication of (now) 32 bit values needs an added cast to avoid
truncation of the result and has been added.

In order to avoid another multiplication from 32 bit domain to 64 bit
domain, the new correction_factor calculation has been changed from
new = old * (DECAY-1) / DECAY
to
new = old - old / DECAY,
which with infinite precision would yeild exactly the same result, but
now changes the direction of rounding. The impact is not significant as
the maximum accumulated difference cannot exceed the value of DECAY,
which is relatively small compared to product of RESOLUTION and DECAY
(8 / 8192).
