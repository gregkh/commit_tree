be2net: Fix be_cmd_if_create() to use MBOX if MCCQ is not created

Currently the IF_CREATE FW cmd is issued only *after* MCCQ is created as
it was coded to only use MCCQ. By fixing this, cmd_if_create() can be
called before MCCQ is created and the same routine for VF provisioning
can be called after.
This allows for consolidating all the queue create routines by moving
the be_cmd_if_create() call above all queue create calls in be_setup().
