rcu: Avoid redundant grace-period kthread wakeups

When setting up an in-the-future "advanced" grace period, the code needs
to wake up the relevant grace-period kthread, which it currently does
unconditionally.  However, this results in needless wakeups in the case
where the advanced grace period is being set up by the grace-period
kthread itself, which is a non-uncommon situation.  This commit therefore
checks to see if the running thread is the grace-period kthread, and
avoids doing the irq_work_queue()-mediated wakeup in that case.
