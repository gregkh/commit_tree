drm: Add drm_bridge

This patch adds the notion of a drm_bridge. A bridge is a chained
device which hangs off an encoder. The drm driver using the bridge
should provide the association between encoder and bridge. Once a
bridge is associated with an encoder, it will participate in mode
set, and dpms (via the enable/disable hooks).
