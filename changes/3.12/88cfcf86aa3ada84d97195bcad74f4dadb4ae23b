ALSA: hda - Fix microphone for Sony VAIO Pro 13 (Haswell model)

The external mic showed up with a precense detect of "always present",
essentially disabling the internal mic. Therefore turn off presence
detection for this pin.

Note: The external mic seems not yet working, but an internal mic is
certainly better than no mic at all.
