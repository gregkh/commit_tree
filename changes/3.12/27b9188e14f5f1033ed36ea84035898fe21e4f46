drm/i915: reorganize ironlake_irq_handler

The ironlake_irq_handler and ivybridge_irq_handler functions do
basically the same thing, but they have different implementation
styles. With this patch we reorganize ironlake_irq_handler in a way
that makes it look very similar to ivybridge_irq_handler.

One of the advantages of this new function style is that we don't
write 0 to the IIR registers anymore.

v2: - Rebase due to changes on previous patches
    - Move pm_iir to a tighter scope (Chris)
