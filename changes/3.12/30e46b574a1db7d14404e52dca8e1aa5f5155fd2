x86: avoid remapping data in parse_setup_data()

Type SETUP_PCI, added by setup_efi_pci(), may advertise a ROM size
larger than early_memremap() is able to handle, which is currently
limited to 256kB. If this occurs it leads to a NULL dereference in
parse_setup_data().

To avoid this, remap the setup_data header and allow parsing functions
for individual types to handle their own data remapping.
