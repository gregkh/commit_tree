mn10300: Fix crash just after starting userspace on !CONFIG_PREEMPT

The mn10300 kernel crashes just after starting userspace programs, if
CONFIG_PREEMPT is disabled:

  Freeing unused kernel memory: 96K (90286000 - 9029e000)
  MISALIGN: 97c33ff9: unsupported instruction f
  MISALIGN: 97c33ff9: unsupported instruction f
  MISALIGN: 97c33ff9: unsupported instruction f
  :

This fixes the problem that was introduced by commit d17fc238ac14
("MN10300: Enable IRQs more in system call exit work path").
