mtd: atmel_nand: pmecc: fix failure to correct bit error in 1024-bytes sector

The PMECC use BCH algorithm to correct error. In BCH algorithm, the primitive
polynomial value is GF(2^13) for 512-bytes sector size. And it is GF(2^14) for
1024-bytes sector size.

This patch will choose correct degree of the remainders (13 or 14) for
different sector size.

Tested in AT91SAM9X5-EK with MLC nand flash.
