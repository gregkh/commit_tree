bridge: fix NULL pointer deref of br_port_get_rcu

The NULL deref happens when br_handle_frame is called between these
2 lines of del_nbp:
	dev->priv_flags &= ~IFF_BRIDGE_PORT;
	/* --> br_handle_frame is called at this time */
	netdev_rx_handler_unregister(dev);

In br_handle_frame the return of br_port_get_rcu(dev) is dereferenced
without check but br_port_get_rcu(dev) returns NULL if:
	!(dev->priv_flags & IFF_BRIDGE_PORT)

Eric Dumazet pointed out the testing of IFF_BRIDGE_PORT is not necessary
here since we're in rcu_read_lock and we have synchronize_net() in
netdev_rx_handler_unregister. So remove the testing of IFF_BRIDGE_PORT
and by the previous patch, make sure br_port_get_rcu is called in
bridging code.
