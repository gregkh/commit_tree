of: call __of_parse_phandle_with_args from of_parse_phandle

The simplest case of __of_parse_phandle_with_args() now implements the
semantics of of_parse_phandle(). Rewrite of_parse_phandle() to call
__of_parse_phandle_with_args() rather than open-coding the simple case.

Optimize __of_parse_phandle_with_args() so that it doesn't call
of_find_node_by_phandle() except when it's strictly needed. This avoids
introducing too much overhead when replacing of_parse_phandle().
