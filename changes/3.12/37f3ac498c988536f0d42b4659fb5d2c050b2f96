ARC: Exception Handlers Code consolidation

After the recent cleanups, all the exception handlers now have same
boilerplate prologue code. Move that into common macro.

This reduces readability but helps greatly with sharing / duplicating
entry code with ARCv2 ISA where the handlers are pretty much the same,
just the entry prologue is different (due to hardware assist).

Also while at it, add the missing FAKE_RET_FROM_EXCPN calls in couple of
places to drop down to pure kernel mode (from exception mode) before
jumping off into "C" code.
