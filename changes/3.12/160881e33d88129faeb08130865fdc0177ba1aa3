NFS: Enable nfs4_setup_sequence() for DELEGRETURN

When CONFIG_NFS_V4_1 is disabled, the calls to nfs4_setup_sequence()
and nfs4_sequence_done() are compiled out for the DELEGRETURN
operation.  To allow NFSv4.0 transport blocking to work for
DELEGRETURN, these call sites have to be present all the time.
