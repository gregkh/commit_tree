bonding: fix system hang due to fast igmp timer rescheduling

After commit 4aa5dee4d9 ("net: convert resend IGMP to notifier event")
we try to acquire rtnl in bond_resend_igmp_join_requests but it can be
scheduled with rtnl already held (e.g. when bond_change_active_slave is
called with rtnl) causing a loop of immediate reschedules + calls because
rtnl_trylock fails each time since it's being already held.
For me this issue leads to system hangs very easy:
modprobe bonding; ifconfig bond0 up; ifenslave bond0 eth0; rmmod
bonding;

The fix is to introduce a small (1 jiffy) delay which is enough for the
sections holding rtnl to finish without putting any strain on the system.
Also adjust the timer in bond_change_active_slave to be 1 jiffy, since
most of the time it's called with rtnl already held.
