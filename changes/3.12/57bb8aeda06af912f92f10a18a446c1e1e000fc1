staging: dwc2: simplify debug output in dwc_hc_init

The value of the hcchar register is built from individual values by
shifting and masking. Before, the debug output extracted the individual
values out of the complete hcchar register again by doing the reverse.
This commit makes the debug output use the original values instead.

One debug message got removed, since it would always print a fixed value
of zero.
