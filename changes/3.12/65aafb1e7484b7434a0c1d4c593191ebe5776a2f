coredump: add new %P variable in core_pattern

Add a new %P variable to be used in core_pattern.  This variable contains
the global PID (PID in the init namespace) as %p contains the PID in the
current namespace which isn't always what we want.

The main use for this is to make it easier to handle crashes that happened
within a container.  With that new variables it's possible to have the
crashes dumped into the container or forwarded to the host with the right
PID (from the host's point of view).
