ftrace/rcu: Do not trace debug_lockdep_rcu_enabled()

The function debug_lockdep_rcu_enabled() is part of the RCU lockdep
debugging, and is called very frequently. I found that if I enable
a lot of debugging and run the function graph tracer, this
function can cause a live lock of the system.

We don't usually trace lockdep infrastructure, no need to trace
this either.
