PCI: Introduce new MSI chip infrastructure

The new struct msi_chip is used to associated an MSI controller with a
PCI bus. It is automatically handed down from the root to its children
during bus enumeration.

This patch provides default (weak) implementations for the architecture-
specific MSI functions (arch_setup_msi_irq(), arch_teardown_msi_irq()
and arch_msi_check_device()) which check if a PCI device's bus has an
attached MSI chip and forward the call appropriately.
