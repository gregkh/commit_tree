powerpc/tm: Switch out userspace PPR and DSCR sooner

When we do a treclaim or trecheckpoint we end up running with userspace
PPR and DSCR values.  Currently we don't do anything special to avoid
running with user values which could cause a severe performance
degradation.

This patch moves the PPR and DSCR save and restore around treclaim and
trecheckpoint so that we run with user values for a much shorter period.
More care is taken with the PPR as it's impact is greater than the DSCR.

This is similar to user exceptions, where we run HTM_MEDIUM early to
ensure that we don't run with a userspace PPR values in the kernel.
