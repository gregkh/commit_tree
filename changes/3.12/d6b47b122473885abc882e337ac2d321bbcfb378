ACPI / sleep: Introduce acpi_os_prepare_extended_sleep() for extended sleep path

Like acpi_os_prepare_sleep(), register a callback for use in systems
like tboot, and xen, which have system specific requirements outside
of ACPICA.  This mirrors the functionality in acpi_os_prepare_sleep(),
called from acpi_hw_sleep()
