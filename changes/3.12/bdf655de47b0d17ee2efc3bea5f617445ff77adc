drm/prime: shrink critical section protected by prime lock

When exporting a gem object as a dma-buf the critical section for the
per-fd prime lock is just the adding (and in case of errors, removing)
of the handle to the per-fd lookup cache.

So restrict the critical section to just that part of the function.

This simplifies later reordering.
