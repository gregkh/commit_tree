net: igmp: Don't flush routing cache when force_igmp_version is modified

The procfs knob /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/force_igmp_version allows the
IGMP protocol version to use to be explicitly set.  As a side effect this
caused the routing cache to be flushed as it was declared as a
DEVINET_SYSCTL_FLUSHING_ENTRY.  Flushing is unnecessary and this patch
makes it so flushing does not occur.

Requested by Hannes Frederic Sowa as he was reviewing other patches
adding procfs entries.
