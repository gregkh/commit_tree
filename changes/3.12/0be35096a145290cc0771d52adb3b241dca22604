mm/hwpoison: don't set migration type twice to avoid holding heavily contend zone->lock

Set pageblock migration type will hold zone->lock which is heavy contended
in system to avoid race.  However, soft offline page will set pageblock
migration type twice during get page if the page is in used, not hugetlbfs
page and not on lru list.  There is unnecessary to set the pageblock
migration type and hold heavy contended zone->lock again if the first
round get page have already set the pageblock to right migration type.

The trick here is migration type is MIGRATE_ISOLATE.  There are other two
parts can change MIGRATE_ISOLATE except hwpoison.  One is memory hoplug,
however, we hold lock_memory_hotplug() which avoid race.  The second is
CMA which umovable page allocation requst can't fallback to.  So it's safe
here.
