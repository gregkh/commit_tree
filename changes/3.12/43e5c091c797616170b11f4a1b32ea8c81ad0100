ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Merge hotplug event handling functions

There are separate handling event functions for hotplug bridges and
for hotplug functions, but they may be combined into one common
hotplug event handling function which simplifies the code slightly.

That also allows a theoretical bug to be dealt with which in
principle may occur if a hotplug bridge is on a dock station, because
in that case the bridge-specific notification should be used instead
of the function-specific one, but the dock station always uses the
latter.
