perf, kvm: Support the in_tx/in_tx_cp modifiers in KVM arch perfmon emulation v5

[KVM maintainers:
The underlying support for this is in perf/core now. So please merge
this patch into the KVM tree.]

This is not arch perfmon, but older CPUs will just ignore it. This makes
it possible to do at least some TSX measurements from a KVM guest

v2: Various fixes to address review feedback
v3: Ignore the bits when no CPUID. No #GP. Force raw events with TSX bits.
v4: Use reserved bits for #GP
v5: Remove obsolete argument
