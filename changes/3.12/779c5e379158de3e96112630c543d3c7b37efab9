tracing: Kill trace_create_file_ops() and friends

trace_create_file_ops() allocates the copy of id/filter/format/enable
file_operations to set "f_op->owner = mod" for fops_get().

However after the recent changes there is no reason to prevent rmmod
even if one of these files is opened. A file operation can do nothing
but fail after remove_event_file_dir() clears ->i_private for every
file removed by trace_module_remove_events().

Kill "struct ftrace_module_file_ops" and fix the compilation errors.
