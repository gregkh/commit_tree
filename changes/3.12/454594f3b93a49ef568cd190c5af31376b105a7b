Revert "bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received"

While this commit was a good attempt to fix issues occuring when no
multicast querier is present, this commit still has two more issues:

1) There are cases where mdb entries do not expire even if there is a
querier present. The bridge will unnecessarily continue flooding
multicast packets on the according ports.

2) Never removing an mdb entry could be exploited for a Denial of
Service by an attacker on the local link, slowly, but steadily eating up
all memory.

Actually, this commit became obsolete with
"bridge: disable snooping if there is no querier" (b00589af3b)
which included fixes for a few more cases.

Therefore reverting the following commits (the commit stated in the
commit message plus three of its follow up fixes):

====================
Revert "bridge: update mdb expiration timer upon reports."
This reverts commit f144febd93d5ee534fdf23505ab091b2b9088edc.
Revert "bridge: do not call setup_timer() multiple times"
This reverts commit 1faabf2aab1fdaa1ace4e8c829d1b9cf7bfec2f1.
Revert "bridge: fix some kernel warning in multicast timer"
This reverts commit c7e8e8a8f7a70b343ca1e0f90a31e35ab2d16de1.
Revert "bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received"
This reverts commit 9f00b2e7cf241fa389733d41b615efdaa2cb0f5b.
