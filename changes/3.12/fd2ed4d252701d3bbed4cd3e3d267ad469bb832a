dm: add statistics support

Support the collection of I/O statistics on user-defined regions of
a DM device.  If no regions are defined no statistics are collected so
there isn't any performance impact.  Only bio-based DM devices are
currently supported.

Each user-defined region specifies a starting sector, length and step.
Individual statistics will be collected for each step-sized area within
the range specified.

The I/O statistics counters for each step-sized area of a region are
in the same format as /sys/block/*/stat or /proc/diskstats but extra
counters (12 and 13) are provided: total time spent reading and
writing in milliseconds.  All these counters may be accessed by sending
the @stats_print message to the appropriate DM device via dmsetup.

The creation of DM statistics will allocate memory via kmalloc or
fallback to using vmalloc space.  At most, 1/4 of the overall system
memory may be allocated by DM statistics.  The admin can see how much
memory is used by reading
/sys/module/dm_mod/parameters/stats_current_allocated_bytes

See Documentation/device-mapper/statistics.txt for more details.
