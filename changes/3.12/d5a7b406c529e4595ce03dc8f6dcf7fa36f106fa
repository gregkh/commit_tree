can: flexcan: flexcan_chip_start: fix regression, mark one MB for TX and abort pending TX

In patch

    0d1862e can: flexcan: fix flexcan_chip_start() on imx6

the loop in flexcan_chip_start() that iterates over all mailboxes after the
soft reset of the CAN core was removed. This loop put all mailboxes (even the
ones marked as reserved 1...7) into EMPTY/INACTIVE mode. On mailboxes 8...63,
this aborts any pending TX messages.

After a cold boot there is random garbage in the mailboxes, which leads to
spontaneous transmit of CAN frames during first activation. Further if the
interface was disabled with a pending message (usually due to an error
condition on the CAN bus), this message is retransmitted after enabling the
interface again.

This patch fixes the regression by:
1) Limiting the maximum number of used mailboxes to 8, 0...7 are used by the RX
FIFO, 8 is used by TX.
2) Marking the TX mailbox as EMPTY/INACTIVE, so that any pending TX of that
mailbox is aborted.
