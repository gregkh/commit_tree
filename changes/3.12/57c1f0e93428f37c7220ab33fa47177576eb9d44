serial: 8250_pci: use local device ID for ADDI-DATA APCI-7800

The quirks and PCI ID table entries for the original ADDI-DATA APCI-7800
(not the newer APCI-7800-3) use PCI_DEVICE_ID_ADDIDATA_APCI7800 from
<linux/pci_ids.h> but the device ID was actually assigned to ADDI-DATA
by Applied Micro Circuits Corporation (PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC).  Replace it
locally with #define PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMCC_ADDIDATA_APCI7800.
