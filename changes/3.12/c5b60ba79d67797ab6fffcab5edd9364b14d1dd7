staging/lustre/ldlm: print FID in lvbo_init(), lvbo_update

Print the namespace and OBD device name, as well as the first two
lock resource fields (typically the FID) if there is an error with
loading the object from disk.  This will be more important with
FID-on-OST and also the MDS.  Using fid_extract_from_res_name() isn't
possible in the LDLM code, since the lock resource may not be a FID.

Make fid_extract_quota_resid() argument order and name consistent
with other fid_*_res() functions, with FID first and resource second.

Fix a bug in ofd_lvbo_init() where NULL lvb is accessed on error.

Print FID in ofd_lvbo_update() CDEBUG() and CERROR() messages.
