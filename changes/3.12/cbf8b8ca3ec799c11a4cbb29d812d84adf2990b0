btrfs: change extent-same to copy entire argument struct

btrfs_ioctl_file_extent_same() uses __put_user_unaligned() to copy some data
back to it's argument struct. Unfortunately, not all architectures provide
__put_user_unaligned(), so compiles break on them if btrfs is selected.

Instead, just copy the whole struct in / out at the start and end of
operations, respectively.
