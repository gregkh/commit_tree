vxlan: Use RCU apis to access sk_user_data.

Use of RCU api makes vxlan code easier to understand.  It also
fixes bug due to missing ACCESS_ONCE() on sk_user_data dereference.
In rare case without ACCESS_ONCE() compiler might omit vs on
sk_user_data dereference.
Compiler can use vs as alias for sk->sk_user_data, resulting in
multiple sk_user_data dereference in rcu read context which
could change.
