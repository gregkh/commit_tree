powerpc/pseries: Do all node initialization in dlpar_parse_cc_node

Currently the OF_DYNAMIC and kref initialization for a node happens in
dlpar_attach_node. However, a node passed to dlpar_attach_node may be a tree
containing child nodes, and no initialization traversal is done on the
tree. Since the children never get their kref initialized or the OF_DYNAMIC
flag set these nodes are prevented from ever being released from memory
should they become detached. This initialization step is better done at the
time each node is allocated in dlpar_parse_cc_node.
