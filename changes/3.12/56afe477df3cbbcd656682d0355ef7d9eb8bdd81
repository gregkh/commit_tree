mm: munlock: bypass per-cpu pvec for putback_lru_page

After introducing batching by pagevecs into munlock_vma_range(), we can
further improve performance by bypassing the copying into per-cpu pagevec
and the get_page/put_page pair associated with that.  Instead we perform
LRU putback directly from our pagevec.  However, this is possible only for
single-mapped pages that are evictable after munlock.  Unevictable pages
require rechecking after putting on the unevictable list, so for those we
fallback to putback_lru_page(), hich handles that.

After this patch, a 13% speedup was measured for munlocking a 56GB large
memory area with THP disabled.
