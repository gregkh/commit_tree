cgroup: convert cgroup_ida to cgroup_idr

This enables us to lookup a cgroup by its id.

v4:
- add a comment for idr_remove() in cgroup_offline_fn().

v3:
- on success, idr_alloc() returns the id but not 0, so fix the BUG_ON()
  in cgroup_init().
- pass the right value to idr_alloc() so that the id for dummy cgroup is 0.
