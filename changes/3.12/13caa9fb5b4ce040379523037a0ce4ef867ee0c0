nfs: use check_submounts_and_drop()

Do have_submounts(), shrink_dcache_parent() and d_drop() atomically.

check_submounts_and_drop() can deal with negative dentries and
non-directories as well.

Non-directories can also be mounted on.  And just like directories we don't
want these to disappear with invalidation.
