Revert "usb: pl2303: also use the divisor based baud rate encoding method for baud rates < 115200 with HX chips"

This reverts commit 61fa8d694b8547894b57ea0d99d0120a58f6ebf8.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
