Btrfs: fix a use-after-free bug in btrfs_dev_replace_finishing

free_device rcu callback, scheduled from btrfs_rm_dev_replace_srcdev,
can be processed before btrfs_scratch_superblock is called, which would
result in a use-after-free on btrfs_device contents.  Fix this by
zeroing the superblock before the rcu callback is registered.
