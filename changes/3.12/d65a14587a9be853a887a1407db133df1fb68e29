ASoC: pxa: use snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data

Use snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data for passing the dma parameters from
clients to the pxa pcm lib. This does no functional change, it's just an
intermedia step to migrate the pxa bits over to dmaengine.

The calculation of dcmd is a transition hack which will be removed again
in a later patch. It's just there to make the transition more readable.
