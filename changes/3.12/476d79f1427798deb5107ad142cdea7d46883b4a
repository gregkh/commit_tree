mmc: dw_mmc: Handle DW_MCI_QUIRK_IDMAC_DTO properly

In (1fb5f68 mmc: dw_mmc: Don't loop when handling an interrupt), the
code for handling DW_MCI_QUIRK_IDMAC_DTO became dead code.  Move it to
where it ought to live.

Found by code inspection and compile-tested only--I don't know of any
boards that need DW_MCI_QUIRK_IDMAC_DTO.
