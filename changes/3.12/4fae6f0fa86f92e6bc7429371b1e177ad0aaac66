USB: handle LPM errors during device suspend correctly

The hub driver's usb_port_suspend() routine doesn't handle errors
related to Link Power Management properly.  It always returns failure,
it doesn't try to clean up the wakeup setting, (in the case of system
sleep) it doesn't try to go ahead with the port suspend regardless,
and it doesn't try to apply the new power-off mechanism.

This patch fixes these problems.
