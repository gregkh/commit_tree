firewire: ohci: beautify some macro definitions

a) Sort device IDs by vendor -- device -- revision.

b) Write quirk flags in hexadecimal.  This affects the user-visible
output of "modinfo firewire-ohci".  Since more flags have been added
recently, it is now easier to cope with them in hexadecimal represen-
tation.  Besides, the device-specific combination of quirk flags is
shown in hexadecimal in the kernel log too.  (And firewire-sbp2
presents its own quirk flags in modinfo as hexadecimals as well.)
