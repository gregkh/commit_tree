KVM: use a more sensible error number when debugfs directory creation fails

I don't know if this was due to cut and paste, or somebody was really
using a D20 to pick the error code for kvm_init_debugfs as suggested by
Linus (EFAULT is 14, so the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out).

In any case, this patch fixes it.
