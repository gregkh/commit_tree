Btrfs: return ENOSPC when target space is full

In extent-tree.c:do_chunk_alloc(), early on we returned 0 (success)
when the target space was full and when chunk allocation is needed.
However, later on in that same function we return ENOSPC if
btrfs_alloc_chunk() fails (and chunk allocation was needed) and
set the space's full flag.

This was inconsistent, as -ENOSPC should be returned if the space
is full and a chunk allocation needs to performed. If the space is
full but no chunk allocation is needed, just return 0 (success).
