perf/x86: Fix uncore PCI fixed counter handling

There was a bug in the handling of SNB-EP/IVB-EP uncore PCI
fixed counters, e.g., IMC.

It would cause erratic values to be returned for the IMC
clockticks event. This was due to a bogus hwc->config value
which was then written to PCI config space.

The erratic values can be seen via:

  $ perf stat -a -C 0 -e uncore_imc_0/clockticks/ -I 1000 sleep 10

The fixed counter has most fields marked as reserved with
hw reset values of 0. Yet the kernel was defaulting to a
hwc->config = ~0 and that was causing the issues.

This patch sets the hwc->config values for fixed uncore event
to 0. Now, the values of IMC clockticks is correct.
