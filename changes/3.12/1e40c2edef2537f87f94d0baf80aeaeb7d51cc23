mutex: Fix/document access-once assumption in mutex_can_spin_on_owner()

mutex_can_spin_on_owner() is technically broken in that it would
in theory allow the compiler to load lock->owner twice, seeing a
pointer first time and a NULL pointer the second time.

Linus pointed out that a compiler has to be seriously broken to
not compile this correctly - but nevertheless this change
is correct as it will better document the implementation.
