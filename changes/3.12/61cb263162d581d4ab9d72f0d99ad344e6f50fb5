ARM: SAMSUNG: Remove remaining uses of plat/regs-timer.h header

This patch removes remaining inclusions of plat/regs-timer.h as
a preparation to remove the header.

As a part of this, things like save and restore of PWM registers are
removed from SoC-specific code, because it is handled in appropriate
drivers now.
