mwifiex: fix adapter pointer dereference issue

It has introduced by recent commit 6b41f941d7cd: "mwifiex:
handle driver initialization error paths" which adds error
path handling for mwifiex_fw_dpc().

release_firmware(adapter->*) is called for success as well
as failure paths. In failure paths, adapter is already freed
at this point.

The issue is fixed by moving mwifiex_free_adapter() call.
