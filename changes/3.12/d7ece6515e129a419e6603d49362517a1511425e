USB: ti_usb_3410_5052: remove vendor/product module parameters

Remove the vendor and product module parameters which were added a long
time ago when we did not have the dynamic sysfs interface to add
new device ids (and which isn't limited to five new vid/pid pair).

A vid/pid pair can be added dynamically using sysfs, for example:

  echo 0451 1234 >/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ti_usb_3410_5052_1/new_id

for 1-port adapters, or

  echo 0451 1234 >/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ti_usb_3410_5052_2/new_id

for 2-port adapters.
