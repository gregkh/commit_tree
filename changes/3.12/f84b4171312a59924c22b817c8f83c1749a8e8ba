drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-nomadik.c:1515:16: note:
'flags' was declared here
  unsigned long flags;

The function is question was never changed but it appears
the semantic checker could previously determine that the code
path that would use the flags was going to either use it or
not, but now it can't for some reason. Just fix it up.
