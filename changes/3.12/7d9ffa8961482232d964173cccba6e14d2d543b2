sched: Micro-optimize the smart wake-affine logic

Smart wake-affine is using node-size as the factor currently, but the overhead
of the mask operation is high.

Thus, this patch introduce the 'sd_llc_size' percpu variable, which will record
the highest cache-share domain size, and make it to be the new factor, in order
to reduce the overhead and make it more reasonable.
