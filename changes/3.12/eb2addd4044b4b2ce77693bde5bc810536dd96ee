USB: serial: option: Ignore card reader interface on Huawei E1750

Hi,

my Huawei 3G modem has an embedded Smart Card reader which causes
trouble when the modem is being detected (a bunch of "<warn>  (ttyUSBx):
open blocked by driver for more than 7 seconds!" in messages.log). This
trivial patch corrects the problem for me. The modem identifies itself
as "12d1:1406 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. E1750" in lsusb although the
description on the body says "Model E173u-1"
