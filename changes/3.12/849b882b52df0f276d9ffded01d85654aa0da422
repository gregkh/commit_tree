ARM: 7829/1: Add ".text.unlikely" and ".text.hot" to arm unwind tables

It appears that gcc may put some code in ".text.unlikely" or
".text.hot" sections.  Right now those aren't accounted for in unwind
tables.  Add them.

I found some docs about this at:
  http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.2/gcc.pdf

Without this, if you have slub_debug turned on, you can get messages
that look like this:
  unwind: Index not found 7f008c50
