cgroup: unexport cgroup_css()

cgroup_css() no longer has any user left outside cgroup.c proper and
we don't want subsystems to grow new usages of the function.  cgroup
core should always provide the css to use to the subsystems, which
will make dynamic creation and destruction of css's across the
lifetime of a cgroup much more manageable than exposing the cgroup
directly to subsystems and let them dereference css's from it.

Make cgroup_css() a static function in cgroup.c.
