ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Get rid of check_sub_bridges()

Now that acpiphp_check_bridge() always enumerates devices behind the
bridge, there is no need to do that for each sub-bridge anymore like
it is done in the current ACPI-based PCI hotplug (ACPIPHP) code.

Given this we don't need check_sub_bridges() anymore, so drop that
function completely.

This also simplifies the ACPIPHP code a bit.
