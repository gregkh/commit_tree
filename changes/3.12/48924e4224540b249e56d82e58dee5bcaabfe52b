dmaengine: PL08x: Move LLI dumping code into separate function

This patch refactors debugging code that dumps LLI entries by moving it
into separate function, which is stubbed when VERBOSE_DEBUG is not
selected. This allows us to get rid of the ugly ifdef from the body of
pl08x_fill_llis_for_desc().

No functional change is introduced by this patch.
