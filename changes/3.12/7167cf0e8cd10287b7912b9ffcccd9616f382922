ll_temac: Reset dma descriptors indexes on ndo_open

The dma descriptors indexes are only initialized on the probe function.

If a packet is on the buffer when temac_stop is called, the dma
descriptors indexes can be left on a incorrect state where no other
package can be sent.

So an interface could be left in an usable state after ifdow/ifup.

This patch makes sure that the descriptors indexes are in a proper
status when the device is open.
