n_tty: Access termios values safely

Use termios_rwsem to guarantee safe access to the termios values.
This is particularly important for N_TTY as changing certain termios
settings alters the mode of operation.

termios_rwsem must be dropped across throttle/unthrottle since
those functions claim the termios_rwsem exclusively (to guarantee
safe access to the termios and for mutual exclusion).
