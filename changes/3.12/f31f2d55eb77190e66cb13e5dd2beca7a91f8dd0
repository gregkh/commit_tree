drm/i915: extract FDI mPHY functions from lpt_init_pch_refclk

Because lpt_init_pch_refclk implements the "Sequence to enable
CLKOUT_DP for FDI usage and configure PCH FDI I/O", which is very
similar to "Sequence to enable CLKOUT_DP" and "Sequence to enable
CLKOUT_DP without spread". With the extracted functions we can more
easily implement the two missing sequences.
