staging/lustre: Only wake up ldlm_poold as frequently as the check interval

We used to wake up ldlm poold every second, but that's overkill,
we should just see how much time is left until next closest recalc
interval hits and sleep this much.
This will make "per-second" client grant statistic not actually
per-second, but I don't think we need any precision in that code
