tile: improve illegal translation interrupt handling

First, don't re-enable interrupts blindly in the Linux trap handler.
We already handle page faults this way; synchronous interrupts like
ILL_TRANS will fire even when interrupts are disabled, and we don't
want to re-enable interrupts in that case.

For ILL_TRANS, we now pass the ILL_VA_PC reason into the trap handler
so we can report it properly; this is the address that caused the
illegal translation trap.  We print the address as part of the
pr_alert() message now if it's coming from the kernel.
