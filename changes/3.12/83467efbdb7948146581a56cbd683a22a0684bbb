mm: migrate: check movability of hugepage in unmap_and_move_huge_page()

Currently hugepage migration works well only for pmd-based hugepages
(mainly due to lack of testing,) so we had better not enable migration of
other levels of hugepages until we are ready for it.

Some users of hugepage migration (mbind, move_pages, and migrate_pages) do
page table walk and check pud/pmd_huge() there, so they are safe.  But the
other users (softoffline and memory hotremove) don't do this, so without
this patch they can try to migrate unexpected types of hugepages.

To prevent this, we introduce hugepage_migration_support() as an
architecture dependent check of whether hugepage are implemented on a pmd
basis or not.  And on some architecture multiple sizes of hugepages are
available, so hugepage_migration_support() also checks hugepage size.
