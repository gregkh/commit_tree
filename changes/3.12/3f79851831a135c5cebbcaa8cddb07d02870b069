hugetlb_cgroup: pass around @hugetlb_cgroup instead of @cgroup

cgroup controller API will be converted to primarily use struct
cgroup_subsys_state instead of struct cgroup.  In preparation, make
hugetlb_cgroup functions pass around struct hugetlb_cgroup instead of
struct cgroup.

This patch shouldn't cause any behavior differences.
