PM / Sleep: new trace event to print device suspend and resume times

A new trace event is added to PM events to print the time it takes to
suspend and resume a device.  It generates trace messages that
include device, driver, parent information in addition to the type of
PM ops invoked as well as the PM event and error status from the PM
ops. Example trace below:

bash-2239  [000] ....   290.883035: device_pm_report_time: backlight
 acpi_video0 parent=0000:00:02.0 state=freeze ops=class nsecs=332 err=0
bash-2239  [000] ....   290.883041: device_pm_report_time: rfkill rf

bash-2239  [001] ....   290.973892: device_pm_report_time: ieee80211
