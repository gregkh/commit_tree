gpio: pca953x: fix gpio input on gpio offsets >= 8

This change fixes a regression introduced by commit
f5f0b7aa8 (gpio: pca953x: make the register access by GPIO bank)

When the pca953x driver was converted to using 8-bit reads/writes
the bitmask in pca953x_gpio_get_value wasn't adjusted with a
modulus BANK_SZ and consequently looks at the wrong bits in the
input register.
