net: sync some IP headers with glibc

Solution:
=========

- Synchronize linux's `include/uapi/linux/in6.h'
  with glibc's `inet/netinet/in.h'.
- Synchronize glibc's `inet/netinet/in.h with linux's
  `include/uapi/linux/in6.h'.
- Allow including the headers in either other.
- First header included defines the structures and macros.

Details:
========

The kernel promises not to break the UAPI ABI so I don't
see why we can't just have the two userspace headers
coordinate?

If you include the kernel headers first you get those,
and if you include the glibc headers first you get those,
and the following patch arranges a coordination and
synchronization between the two.

Let's handle `include/uapi/linux/in6.h' from linux,
and `inet/netinet/in.h' from glibc and ensure they compile
in any order and preserve the required ABI.

These two patches pass the following compile tests:

cat >> test1.c <<EOF
int main (void) {
  return 0;
}
EOF
gcc -c test1.c

cat >> test2.c <<EOF
int main (void) {
  return 0;
}
EOF
gcc -c test2.c

One wrinkle is that the kernel has a different name for one of
the members in ipv6_mreq. In the kernel patch we create a macro
to cover the uses of the old name, and while that's not entirely
clean it's one of the best solutions (aside from an anonymous
union which has other issues).

I've reviewed the code and it looks to me like the ABI is
assured and everything matches on both sides.

Notes:
- You want netinet/in.h to include bits/in.h as early as possible,
  but it needs in_addr so define in_addr early.
- You want bits/in.h included as early as possible so you can use
  the linux specific code to define __USE_KERNEL_DEFS based on
  the _UAPI_* macro definition and use those to cull in.h.
- glibc was missing IPPROTO_MH, added here.

Compile tested and inspected.
