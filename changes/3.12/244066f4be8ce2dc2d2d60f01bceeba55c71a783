xtensa: fix fast_syscall_spill_registers_fixup

fast_syscall_spill_registers_fixup was not correctly updated by the
'keep a3 and excsave1 on entry to exception handlers' patch: it doesn't
preserve a3 that it gets on entry, breaking _spill_registers in case of
page fault on stack during register spilling, leading to unhandled
exception in kernel mode.

Preserve a3 by saving it in the original _spill_registers stack frame's
a3 during exception handling and restoring it afterwards.

Also fix comments and function bounds annotations.
