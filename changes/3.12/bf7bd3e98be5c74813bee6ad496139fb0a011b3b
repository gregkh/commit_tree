nfsd4: fix leak of inode reference on delegation failure

This fixes a regression from 68a3396178e6688ad7367202cdf0af8ed03c8727
"nfsd4: shut down more of delegation earlier".

After that commit, nfs4_set_delegation() failures result in
nfs4_put_delegation being called, but nfs4_put_delegation doesn't free
the nfs4_file that has already been set by alloc_init_deleg().

This can result in an oops on later unmounting the exported filesystem.

Note also delaying the fi_had_conflict check we're able to return a
better error (hence give 4.1 clients a better idea why the delegation
failed; though note CONFLICT isn't an exact match here, as that's
supposed to indicate a current conflict, but all we know here is that
there was one recently).
