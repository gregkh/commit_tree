perf sched: Move struct perf_sched definition out of cmd_sched()

For some reason it consumed quite amount of compile time when declared
as local variable, and it disappeared when moved out of the function.
Moving other variables/tables didn't help.

On my system this single-file-change build time reduced from 11s to 3s.
