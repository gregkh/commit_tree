Input: MAINTAINERS - change maintainer for cyttsp driver

I haven't had time to work on this driver for a long time and
Ferruh has been doing a great job making it more generic,
adding support for new hardware and providing bug fixes.

So, let's make MAINTAINERS reflect reality and add him as the
cyttsp maintainer instead of me.

Also, since Ferruh works for Cypress, we may change the driver
status from Maintained to Supported.
