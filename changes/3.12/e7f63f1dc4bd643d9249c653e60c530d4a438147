bonding: add bond_time_in_interval() and use it for time comparison

Currently we use a lot of time comparison math for arp_interval
comparisons, which are sometimes quite hard to read and understand.

All the time comparisons have one pattern:
(time - arp_interval_jiffies) <= jiffies <= (time + mod *
arp_interval_jiffies + arp_interval_jiffies/2)

Introduce a new helper - bond_time_in_interval(), which will do the math in
one place and, thus, will clean up the logical code. This helper introduces
a bit of overhead (by always calculating the jiffies from arp_interval),
however it's really not visible, considering that functions using it
usually run once in arp_interval milliseconds.

There are several lines slightly over 80 chars, however breaking them would
result in more hard-to-read code than several character after the 80 mark.
