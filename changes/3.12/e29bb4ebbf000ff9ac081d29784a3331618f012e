    drm/i915: avoid big kmallocs on reading error state

we introduce a two-pass mechanism for splitting long strings being
formatted into the error-state. The first pass finds the length, and the
second pass emits the right portion of the string into the accumulation
buffer. Unfortunately we use the same va_list for both passes, resulting
in the second pass reading garbage off the end of the argument list. As
the two passes are only used for boundaries between read() calls, the
corruption is only rarely seen.

This fixes the root cause behind
