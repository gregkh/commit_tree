ARM: 7839/1: entry: fix tracing of ARM-private syscalls

Commit 377747c40657 ("ARM: entry: allow ARM-private syscalls to be
restarted") reworked the low-level syscall dispatcher to allow
restarting of ARM-private syscalls. Unfortunately, this relocated the
label used to dispatch a private syscall from the trace path, so that
the invocation would be bypassed altogether!

This causes applications to fail under strace as soon as they rely on
a private syscall (e.g. set_tls):

  set_tls(0xb6fad4c0, 0xb6fadb98, 0xb6fb1050, 0xb6fad4c0, 0xb6fb1050)
      = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)

This patch fixes the label so that we correctly dispatch private
syscalls from the trace path.
