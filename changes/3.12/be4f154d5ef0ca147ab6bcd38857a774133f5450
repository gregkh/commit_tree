bridge: Clamp forward_delay when enabling STP

At some point limits were added to forward_delay.  However, the
limits are only enforced when STP is enabled.  This created a
scenario where you could have a value outside the allowed range
while STP is disabled, which then stuck around even after STP
is enabled.

This patch fixes this by clamping the value when we enable STP.

I had to move the locking around a bit to ensure that there is
no window where someone could insert a value outside the range
while we're in the middle of enabling STP.
