xfs: asserting lock not held during freeing not valid

When we free an inode, we do so via RCU. As an RCU lookup can occur
at any time before we free an inode, and that lookup takes the inode
flags lock, we cannot safely assert that the flags lock is not held
just before marking it dead and running call_rcu() to free the
inode.

We check on allocation of a new inode structre that the lock is not
held, so we still have protection against locks being leaked and
hence not correctly initialised when allocated out of the slab.
Hence just remove the assert...
