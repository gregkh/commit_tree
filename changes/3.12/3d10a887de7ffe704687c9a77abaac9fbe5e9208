ARM: i.MX: change dev_id to cpu0 while registering cpu clock

Currently all clkdev registration use "cpufreq-cpu0.0" as dev_id
for cpu clock which refers to virtual platform device. It needs to
be "cpu0" instead which is actual cpu0 device id.

This patch changes the dev_id from "cpufreq-cpu0.0" to "cpu0".
