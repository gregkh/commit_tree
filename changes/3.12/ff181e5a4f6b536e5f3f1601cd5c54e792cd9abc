ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Clean up bridge_mutex usage

Do not acquire bridge_mutex around the addition of a slot to its
bridge's list of slots and arount the addition of a function to
its slot's list of functions, because that doesn't help anything
right now (those lists are walked without any locking anyway).

However, acquire bridge_mutex around the list walk in
acpiphp_remove_slots() and use list_for_each_entry() there,
because we terminate the walk as soon as we find the first matching
entry.  This prevents that list walk from colliding with bridge
addition and removal.
