powerpc: add Book E support to 64-bit hibernation

Update the 64-bit hibernation code to support Book E CPUs.
Some registers and instructions are not defined for Book3e
(SDR reg, tlbia instruction).

SDR: Storage Description Register. Book3S and Book3E have different
address translation mode, we do not need HTABORG & HTABSIZE to
translate virtual address to real address.

More registers are saved in BookE-64bit.(TCR, SPRG1)
