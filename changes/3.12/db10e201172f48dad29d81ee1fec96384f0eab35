iio: at91: fix adc_clk overflow

The adc_clk variable is currently defined using a 32-bits unsigned integer,
which will overflow under some very valid range of operations.

Such overflow will occur if, for example, the parent clock is set to a
20MHz frequency and the ADC startup time is larger than 215ns.

To fix this, introduce an intermediate variable holding the clock rate
in kHz.
