Bluetooth: Fix the reference counting of tty_port

The tty_port can be released in two cases: when we get a HUP in the
functions rfcomm_tty_hangup() and rfcomm_dev_state_change(). Or when the
user releases the device in rfcomm_release_dev().

In these cases we set the flag RFCOMM_TTY_RELEASED so that no other
function can get a reference to the tty_port.
The use of !test_and_set_bit(RFCOMM_TTY_RELEASED) ensures that the
'initial' tty_port reference is only dropped once.

The rfcomm_dev_del function is removed becase it isn't used anymore.
