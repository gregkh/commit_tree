Btrfs: fix what bits we clear when erroring out from delalloc

First of all we no longer set EXTENT_DIRTY when we dirty an extent so this patch
removes the clearing of EXTENT_DIRTY since it confuses me.  This patch also adds
clearing EXTENT_DEFRAG and also doing EXTENT_DO_ACCOUNTING when we have errors.
This is because if we are clearing delalloc without adding an ordered extent
then we need to make sure the enospc handling stuff is accounted for.  Also if
this range was DEFRAG we need to make sure that bit is cleared so we dont leak
it.  Thanks,
