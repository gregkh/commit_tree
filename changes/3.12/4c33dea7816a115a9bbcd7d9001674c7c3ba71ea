firmware: dcdbas: use binary attribute groups

The dcdbas code was "hand rolling" a binary attribute group, which the
driver core now supports automatically.  So remove the "create the files
by hand" logic, and just set the proper field in the attribute group
structure, saving lots of code and headache.

 Doug, I can take this through my driver-core tree if you don't object.
