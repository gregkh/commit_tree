cgroup: add subsystem pointer to cgroup_subsys_state

Currently, given a cgroup_subsys_state, there's no way to find out
which subsystem the css is for, which we'll need to convert the cgroup
controller API to primarily use @css instead of @cgroup.  This patch
adds cgroup_subsys_state->ss which points to the subsystem the @css
belongs to.

While at it, remove the comment about accessing @css->cgroup to
determine the hierarchy.  cgroup core will provide API to traverse
hierarchy of css'es and we don't want subsystems to directly walk
cgroup hierarchies anymore.
