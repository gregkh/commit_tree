vhost: wake up worker outside spin_lock

the wake_up_process func is included by spin_lock/unlock in
vhost_work_queue,
but it could be done outside the spin_lock.
I have test it with kernel 3.0.27 and guest suse11-sp2 using iperf,
the num as below.
                  original                 modified
