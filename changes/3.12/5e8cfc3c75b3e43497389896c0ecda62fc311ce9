memcg: use __this_cpu_sub() to dec stats to avoid incorrect subtrahend casting

As of commit 3ea67d06e467 ("memcg: add per cgroup writeback pages
accounting") memcg counter errors are possible when moving charged
memory to a different memcg.  Charge movement occurs when processing
writes to memory.force_empty, moving tasks to a memcg with
memcg.move_charge_at_immigrate=1, or memcg deletion.

An example showing error after memory.force_empty:

  $ cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
  $ mkdir x
  $ rm /data/tmp/file
  $ (echo $BASHPID >> x/tasks && exec mmap_writer /data/tmp/file 1M) &
  [1] 13600
  $ grep ^mapped x/memory.stat
  mapped_file 1048576
  $ echo 13600 > tasks
  $ echo 1 > x/memory.force_empty
  $ grep ^mapped x/memory.stat
  mapped_file 4503599627370496

mapped_file should end with 0.
  4503599627370496 == 0x10,0000,0000,0000 == 0x100,0000,0000 pages
  1048576          == 0x10,0000           == 0x100 pages

This issue only affects the source memcg on 64 bit machines; the
destination memcg counters are correct.  So the rmdir case is not too
important because such counters are soon disappearing with the entire
memcg.  But the memcg.force_empty and memory.move_charge_at_immigrate=1
cases are larger problems as the bogus counters are visible for the
(possibly long) remaining life of the source memcg.

The problem is due to memcg use of __this_cpu_from(.., -nr_pages), which
is subtly wrong because it subtracts the unsigned int nr_pages (either
-1 or -512 for THP) from a signed long percpu counter.  When
nr_pages=-1, -nr_pages=0xffffffff.  On 64 bit machines stat->count[idx]
is signed 64 bit.  So memcg's attempt to simply decrement a count (e.g.
from 1 to 0) boils down to:

  long count = 1
  unsigned int nr_pages = 1
  count += -nr_pages  /* -nr_pages == 0xffff,ffff */
  count is now 0x1,0000,0000 instead of 0

The fix is to subtract the unsigned page count rather than adding its
negation.  This only works once "percpu: fix this_cpu_sub() subtrahend
casting for unsigneds" is applied to fix this_cpu_sub().
