w1 - call request_module with w1 master mutex unlocked

request_module for w1 slave modules needs to be called with the w1
master mutex unlocked. Because w1_attach_slave_device gets always(?)
called with mutex locked, we need to temporarily unlock the w1 master
mutex for the loading of the w1 slave module.
