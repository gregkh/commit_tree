netfilter: nf_conntrack: use RCU safe kfree for conntrack extensions

Commit 68b80f11 (netfilter: nf_nat: fix RCU races) introduced
RCU protection for freeing extension data when reallocation
moves them to a new location. We need the same protection when
freeing them in nf_ct_ext_free() in order to prevent a
use-after-free by other threads referencing a NAT extension data
via bysource list.
