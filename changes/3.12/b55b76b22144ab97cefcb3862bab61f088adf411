ipv6:introduce function to find route for redirect

RFC 4861 says that the IP source address of the Redirect is the
same as the current first-hop router for the specified ICMP
Destination Address, so the gateway should be taken into
consideration when we find the route for redirect.

There was once a check in commit
a6279458c534d01ccc39498aba61c93083ee0372 ("NDISC: Search over
all possible rules on receipt of redirect.") and the check
went away in commit b94f1c0904da9b8bf031667afc48080ba7c3e8c9
("ipv6: Use icmpv6_notify() to propagate redirect, instead of
rt6_redirect()").

The bug is only "exploitable" on layer-2 because the source
address of the redirect is checked to be a valid link-local
address but it makes spoofing a lot easier in the same L2
domain nonetheless.

Thanks very much for Hannes's help.
