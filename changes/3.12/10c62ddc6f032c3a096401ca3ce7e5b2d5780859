Bluetooth: Parameters for outgoing SCO connections

In order to establish a transparent SCO connection, the correct settings
must be specified in the Setup Synchronous Connection request. For that,
a setting field is added to ACL connection data to set up the desired
parameters. The patch also removes usage of hdev->voice_setting in CVSD
connection and makes use of T2 parameters for transparent data.
