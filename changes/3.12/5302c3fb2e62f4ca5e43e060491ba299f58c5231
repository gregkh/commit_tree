cpufreq: Perform light-weight init/teardown during suspend/resume

Now that we have the infrastructure to perform a light-weight init/tear-down,
use that in the cpufreq CPU hotplug notifier when invoked from the
suspend/resume path.

This also ensures that the file permissions of the cpufreq sysfs files are
preserved across suspend/resume, something which commit a66b2e (cpufreq:
Preserve sysfs files across suspend/resume) originally intended to do, but
had to be reverted due to other problems.
