ipc, msg: forbid negative values for "msg{max,mnb,mni}"

Negative message lengths make no sense -- so don't do negative queue
lenghts or identifier counts. Prevent them from getting negative.

Also change the underlying data types to be unsigned to avoid hairy
surprises with sign extensions in cases where those variables get
evaluated in unsigned expressions with bigger data types, e.g size_t.

In case a user still wants to have "unlimited" sizes she could just use
INT_MAX instead.
