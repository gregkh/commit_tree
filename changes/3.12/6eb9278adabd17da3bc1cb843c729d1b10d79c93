drm: remove the dma_ioctl special-case

We might as well have a real ioctl function which checks for the
callbacks. This seems to be a remnant from back in the days when each
drm driver had their own complete ioctl table, with no shared core
drm table at all.

To make really sure no mis-guided user in a kms driver pops up again
explicitly check for that in the new ioctl implementation.

v2: Drop the unused variable I've accidentally left in the code,
spotted by David Herrmann.
