USBNET: centralize computing of max rx/tx qlen

This patch centralizes computing of max rx/tx qlen, because:

- RX_QLEN()/TX_QLEN() is called in hot path
- computing depends on device's usb speed, now we have ls/fs, hs, ss,
so more checks need to be involved
- in fact, max rx/tx qlen should not only depend on device USB
speed, but also depend on ethernet link speed, so we need to
consider that in future.
- if SG support is done, max tx qlen may need change too

Generally, hard_mtu and rx_urb_size are changed in bind(), reset()
and link_reset() callback, and change mtu network operation, this
patches introduces the API of usbnet_update_max_qlen(), and calls
it in above path.
