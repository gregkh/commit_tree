arch: mm: do not invoke OOM killer on kernel fault OOM

Kernel faults are expected to handle OOM conditions gracefully (gup,
uaccess etc.), so they should never invoke the OOM killer.  Reserve this
for faults triggered in user context when it is the only option.

Most architectures already do this, fix up the remaining few.
