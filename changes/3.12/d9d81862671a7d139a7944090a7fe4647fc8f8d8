bnx2x: prevent masking error from cnic

During error flows while loading cnic the return value was incorrectly replaced
by that of bnx2x_set_real_num_queues(); If that function was to finish
successfully then the cnic would have mistakenly thought the load ended
successfully, causing issues (& panics) later on.
