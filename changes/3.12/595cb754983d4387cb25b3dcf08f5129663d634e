vhost/scsi: use vmalloc for order-10 allocation

As vhost scsi device struct is large, if the device is
created on a busy system, kzalloc() might fail, so this patch does a
fallback to vzalloc().

As vmalloc() adds overhead on data-path, add __GFP_REPEAT
to kzalloc() flags to do this fallback only when really needed.
