vt: make the default color configurable

The virtual console has (undocumented) module parameters to set the
colors for italic and underlined text, but the default text color was
hardcoded for some reason.  This made it impossible to change the color
for startup messages, or to set the default for new virtual consoles.
Add a module parameter for that, and document the entire bunch.

Any hacker who thinks that a command prompt on a "black screen with
white font" is not supicious enough can now use the kernel parameter
vt.color=10 to get a nice, evil green.
