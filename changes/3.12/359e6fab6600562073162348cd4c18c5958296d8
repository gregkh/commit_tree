watchdog: update watchdog attributes atomically

proc_dowatchdog doesn't synchronize multiple callers which might lead to
confusion when two parallel callers might confuse watchdog_enable_all_cpus
resp watchdog_disable_all_cpus (eg watchdog gets enabled even if
watchdog_thresh was set to 0 already).

This patch adds a local mutex which synchronizes callers to the sysctl
handler.
