pstore: Add compression support to pstore

Add compression support to pstore which will help in capturing more data.
Initially, pstore will make a call to kmsg_dump with a bigger buffer
and will pass the size of bigger buffer to kmsg_dump and then compress
the data to registered buffer of registered size.

In case compression fails, pstore will capture the uncompressed
data by making a call again to kmsg_dump with registered_buffer
of registered size.

Pstore will indicate the data is compressed or not with a flag
in the write callback.
