xfs: Validate log space at mount time

Validate log space during log mount stage, the underlying function
will drop a warning message via syslog in critical level if the log
space is too small or too large.

[ dchinner: For CRC enable filesystems, abort the mounting of the
filesystem as mkfs should never make a log too small for the given
filesystem configuration. ]

[ dchinner: make a note of the fact that the log size limits in
block counts are in units of filesystem blocks, not basic blocks. ]
