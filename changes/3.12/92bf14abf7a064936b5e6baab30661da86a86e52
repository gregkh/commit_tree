be2net: refactor be_get_resources() code

1) use be_resources{} struct to query/store HW resource limits
2) The HW queue/resource limits for BE2/BE3 chips are mostly called out
   in driver as constants.  Code to handle this is scattered across various
   places in be_setup(). Consolidate this code into BEx_get_resources().
   For Lancer-R, Skyhawk-R, these limits are queried from FW.
