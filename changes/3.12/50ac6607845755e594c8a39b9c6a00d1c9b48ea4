cfg80211/nl80211: rename packet pattern related structures and enums

Currently packet patterns and it's enum/structures are used only
for WoWLAN feature. As we intend to reuse them for new feature
packet coalesce, they are renamed in this patch.

Older names are kept for backward compatibility purpose.
