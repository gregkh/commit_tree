MIPS: ath79: Don't hardwire cpu_has_dsp{2} to 0

The ath79 code supports various SoCs which are using either a 24Kc
or a 74Kc core. The 74Kc core has DSP support, so don't hardwire
the values to zero.

Commit 00dc5ce2a653a332190aa29b2e1f3bceaa7d5b8d (MIPS: ath79: don't
hardcode the unavailability of the DSP ASE) has fixed this already,
but that change got reverted by 475032564ed96c94c085e3e7a90e07d150a7cec9
(MIPS: Hardwire detection of DSP ASE Rev 2 for systems, as required.)
