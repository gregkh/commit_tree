fork: unify and tighten up CLONE_NEWUSER/CLONE_NEWPID checks

do_fork() denies CLONE_THREAD | CLONE_PARENT if NEWUSER | NEWPID.

Then later copy_process() denies CLONE_SIGHAND if the new process will
be in a different pid namespace (task_active_pid_ns() doesn't match
current->nsproxy->pid_ns).

This looks confusing and inconsistent.  CLONE_NEWPID is very similar to
the case when ->pid_ns was already unshared, we want the same
restrictions so copy_process() should also nack CLONE_PARENT.

And it would be better to deny CLONE_NEWUSER && CLONE_SIGHAND as well
just for consistency.

Kill the "CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWPID" check in do_fork() and change
copy_process() to do the same check along with ->pid_ns check we already
have.
