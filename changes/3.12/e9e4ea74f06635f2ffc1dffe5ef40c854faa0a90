net: smc91x: dont't use SMC_outw for fixing up halfword-aligned data

SMC_outw invokes an endian-aware I/O accessor, which may change the data
endianness before writing to the device. This is not suitable for data
transfers where the memory buffer is simply a string of bytes that does
not require any byte-swapping.

This patches fixes the smc91x SMC_PUSH_DATA macro so that it uses the
string I/O accessor for outputting the leading or trailing halfwords on
halfword-aligned buffers.
