perf tools: Fix libaudit test

In ubuntu systems the libaudit test was always failing due to the
newline in the printf call not being escaped, which somehow didn't
prevented the test from working as expected on other systems, such
as fedora18.

Fix it by removing the newline, as this is just a test, that program is
just a compile test.

The error messages, obtained using 'make V=1':

    CHK libaudit
<stdin>: In function ‘main’:
<stdin>:5:9: error: missing terminating " character [-Werror]
<stdin>:5:2: error: missing terminating " character
<stdin>:6:1: error: missing terminating " character [-Werror]
<stdin>:6:1: error: missing terminating " character
<stdin>:7:2: error: expected expression before ‘return’
<stdin>:8:1: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
config/Makefile:241: No libaudit.h found, disables 'trace' tool, please install audit-libs-devel or libaudit-dev

After this change the test works as expected in all systems tested and the
'trace' tool is built when the needed devel packages are installed.
