mtd: fsmc_nand: add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions

Add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions to fix the following
build warning when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not selected. This is because
sleep PM callbacks defined by SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS are only used when
the CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled. Also, unnecessary CONFIG_PM ifdefs
are removed.

drivers/mtd/nand/fsmc_nand.c:1194:12: warning: 'fsmc_nand_suspend' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/mtd/nand/fsmc_nand.c:1202:12: warning: 'fsmc_nand_resume' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
