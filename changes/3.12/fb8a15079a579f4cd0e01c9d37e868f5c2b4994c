video: mmp: drop needless devm cleanup

The nice thing about devm_* is that the driver doesn't need to free the
resources but the driver core takes care about that. This also
simplifies the error path quite a bit and removes the wrong check for a
clock pointer being NULL.

"And this patch also fixes the above: disabling/unpreparing _after_ putting
the thing - which was quite silly... :)"
