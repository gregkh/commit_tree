staging: dwc2: fix off-by-one in check for max_packet_count parameter

Previously, the max_packet_count could be set to 1 << x, where x is the
number of bits available (width + 4 in the code). Since 1 << x requires
x + 1 bits to represent, this will not work. The real maximum value is
(1 << x) - 1. This value is already used the default when the set value
is invalid, but the upper limit for the set value was off-by-one.

This change makes the check the same as the one for max_transfer_size,
which was already correct.
