ARM: dts: imx27-phytec-phycore-som: Fix regulator settings

Outputs regulator SW1A and SW1A, SW2A and SW2B are connected together,
so it determined as "joined" operation for MC13783. Separate work of
these outputs in this case would be wrong, so we define only one of
the outputs.
Additionally, define the full range of voltages for the CPU (1.2v - 1.52v).
