PCI: Delay enabling bridges until they're needed

We currently enable PCI bridges after scanning a bus and assigning
resources.  This is often done in arch code.

This patch changes this so we don't enable a bridge until necessary, i.e.,
until we enable a PCI device behind the bridge.  We do this in the generic
pci_enable_device() path, so this also removes the arch-specific code to
enable bridges.
