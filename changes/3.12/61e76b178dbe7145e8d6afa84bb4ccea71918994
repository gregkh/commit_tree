ICMPv6: treat dest unreachable codes 5 and 6 as EACCES, not EPROTO

RFC 4443 has defined two additional codes for ICMPv6 type 1 (destination
unreachable) messages:
        5 - Source address failed ingress/egress policy
	6 - Reject route to destination

Now they are treated as protocol error and icmpv6_err_convert() converts them
to EPROTO.

RFC 4443 says:
	"Codes 5 and 6 are more informative subsets of code 1."

Treat codes 5 and 6 as code 1 (EACCES)

Btw, connect() returning -EPROTO confuses firefox, so that fallback to
other/IPv4 addresses does not work:
