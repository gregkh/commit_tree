nEPT: Fix cr3 handling in nested exit and entry

The existing code for handling cr3 and related VMCS fields during nested
exit and entry wasn't correct in all cases:

If L2 is allowed to control cr3 (and this is indeed the case in nested EPT),
during nested exit we must copy the modified cr3 from vmcs02 to vmcs12, and
we forgot to do so. This patch adds this copy.

If L0 isn't controlling cr3 when running L2 (i.e., L0 is using EPT), and
whoever does control cr3 (L1 or L2) is using PAE, the processor might have
saved PDPTEs and we should also save them in vmcs12 (and restore later).
