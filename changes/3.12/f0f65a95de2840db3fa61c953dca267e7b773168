Revert "staging: zram: Add auto loading of module if user opens /dev/zram."

This reverts commit c70bda992c12e593e411c02a52e4bd6985407539.

It's incorrect, Kay writes:
	Please just remove it. "devname" is meant to be used for
	single-instance devices with a static dev_t, never for things
	like zramX.

	It will not do anything useful here, it does nothing really
	without a statically assigned dev_t, and it should not be used
	for devices of this kind anyway.
