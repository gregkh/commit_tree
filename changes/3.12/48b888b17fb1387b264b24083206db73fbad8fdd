sh-pfc: sh7722: Remove unused input_pd and input_pu ranges

The PFC SH7722 SoC data contains input_pd and input_pu ranges used to
configure pull-down and pull-up resistors using the legacy non-pinconf
API. That API has been removed from the driver, the ranges are thus not
used anymore. Remove them.

If required, configuring pull-down and pull-up resistors for the SH7722
can be implemented using the pinconf API, as done for the SH-Mobile,
R-Mobile and R-Car platforms.
