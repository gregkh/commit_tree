cpufreq: Extract the handover of policy cpu to a helper function

During cpu offline, when the policy->cpu is going down, some other CPU
present in the policy->cpus mask is nominated as the new policy->cpu.
Extract this functionality from __cpufreq_remove_dev() and implement
it in a helper function. This helps in upcoming code reorganization.
