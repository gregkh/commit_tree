Drivers: hv: util: Correctly support ws2008R2 and earlier

The current code does not correctly negotiate the version numbers for the util
driver when hosted on earlier hosts. The version numbers presented by this
driver were not compatible with the version numbers supported by Windows Server
2008. Fix this problem.

I would like to thank Olaf Hering (ohering@suse.com) for identifying the problem.
