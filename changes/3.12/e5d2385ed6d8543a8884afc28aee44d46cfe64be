f2fs: recover date requested by fdatasync

In order to support SQLite that uses fdatasync instead of fsync, we should
guarantee the data requested by fdatasync can be recovered after sudden-power-
off.

So, let's remove the fdatasync condition in f2fs_sync_file.
Otherwise, we can restore the data after sudden-power-off due to nonexistence
of any fsync mark'ed node blocks.
