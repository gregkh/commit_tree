drm/i915: flip on a no fb -> fb transition if crtc is active v3

If the crtc is active, we can simply flip a new fb onto it, provided the
other mode setting reqs are met.  Otherwise, we'll need to do a full
mode set to re-enable the crtc.

v2: check for crtc active and set mode_changed accordingly
v3: add module parameter, i915.fastboot, to control no fb -> fb flip behavior
