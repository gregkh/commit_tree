n_tty: Use separate head and tail indices for echo_buf

Instead of using a single index to track the current echo_buf position,
use a head index when adding to the buffer and a tail index when
consuming from the buffer. Allow these head and tail indices to wrap
at max representable value; perform modulo reduction via helper
functions when accessing the buffer.
