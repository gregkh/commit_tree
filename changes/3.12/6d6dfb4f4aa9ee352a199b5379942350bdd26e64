VMCI: Add support for virtual IOMMU

This patch adds support for virtual IOMMU to the vmci module.  We switch
to DMA consistent mappings for guest queuepair and doorbell pages that
are passed to the device.  We still allocate each page individually,
since there's no guarantee that we'll get a contiguous block of physical
for an entire queuepair (especially since we allow up to 128 MiB!).

Also made the split between guest and host in the kernelIf struct much
clearer.  Now it's obvious which fields are which.
