Bluetooth: Implement .activate, .shutdown and .carrier_raised methods

Implement .activate, .shutdown and .carrier_raised methods of tty_port
to manage the dlc, moving the code from rfcomm_tty_install() and
rfcomm_tty_cleanup() functions.

At the same time the tty .open()/.close() and .hangup() methods are
changed to use the tty_port helpers that properly call the
aforementioned tty_port methods.
