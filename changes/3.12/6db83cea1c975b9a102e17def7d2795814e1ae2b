arm64: fix possible invalid FPSIMD initialization state

If context switching happens during executing fpsimd_flush_thread(),
stale value in FPSIMD registers will be saved into current thread's
fpsimd_state by fpsimd_thread_switch(). That may cause invalid
initialization state for the new process, so disable preemption
when executing fpsimd_flush_thread().
