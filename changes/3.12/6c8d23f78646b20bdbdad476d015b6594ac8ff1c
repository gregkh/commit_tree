bonding: simplify and fix peer notification

This patch aims to remove a use of the bond->lock for mutual exclusion
which will later allow easier migration to RCU of the users of this
functionality. We use RTNL as a synchronizing mechanism since it's
always held when send_peer_notif is set, and when it is decremented from
the notifier function. We can also drop some locking, and fix the
leakage of the send_peer_notif counter.
