cgroup: make hierarchy iterators deal with cgroup_subsys_state instead of cgroup

cgroup is currently in the process of transitioning to using css
(cgroup_subsys_state) as the primary handle instead of cgroup in
subsystem API.  For hierarchy iterators, this is beneficial because

* In most cases, css is the only thing subsystems care about anyway.

* On the planned unified hierarchy, iterations for different
  subsystems will need to skip over different subtrees of the
  hierarchy depending on which subsystems are enabled on each cgroup.
  Passing around css makes it unnecessary to explicitly specify the
  subsystem in question as css is intersection between cgroup and
  subsystem

* For the planned unified hierarchy, css's would need to be created
  and destroyed dynamically independent from cgroup hierarchy.  Having
  cgroup core manage css iteration makes enforcing deref rules a lot
  easier.

Most subsystem conversions are straight-forward.  Noteworthy changes
are

* blkio: cgroup_to_blkcg() is no longer used.  Removed.

* freezer: cgroup_freezer() is no longer used.  Removed.

* devices: cgroup_to_devcgroup() is no longer used.  Removed.
