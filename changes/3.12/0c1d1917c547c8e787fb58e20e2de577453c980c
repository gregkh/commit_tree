tile: support simulator notification for ET_DYN objects

The tile code notifies the simulator of new ET_EXEC objects starting
to execute so that tracing code can properly annotate the objects.
However, we didn't support ET_DYN executables like ld.so, so we
didn't properly load symbols, etc.  This change enables that support;
we use a variant of the SIM_CONTROL_DLOPEN simulator notification
that newer simulators will recognize and use to set the base address
for the next SIM_CONTROL_OS_EXEC notification.
