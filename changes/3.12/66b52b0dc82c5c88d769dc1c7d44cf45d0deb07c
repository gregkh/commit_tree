net: add ndo to get id of physical port of the device

This patch adds a ndo for getting physical port of the device. Driver
which is aware of being virtual function of some physical port should
implement this ndo. This is applicable not only for IOV, but for other
solutions (NPAR, multichannel) as well. Basically if there is possible
to have multiple netdevs on the single hw port.
