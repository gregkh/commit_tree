Btrfs: drop dir i_size when adding new names on replay

So if we have dir_index items in the log that means we also have the inode item
as well, which means that the inode's i_size is correct.  However when we
process dir_index'es we call btrfs_add_link() which will increase the
directory's i_size for the new entry.  To fix this we need to just set the dir
items i_size to 0, and then as we find dir_index items we adjust the i_size.
btrfs_add_link() will do it for new entries, and if the entry already exists we
can just add the name_len to the i_size ourselves.  Thanks,
