drm/i915: No LVDS hardware on Intel D410PT and D425KT

The Intel D410PT(LW) and D425KT Mini-ITX desktop boards both show up as
having LVDS but the hardware is not populated. This patch adds them to
the list of such systems. Patch is against 3.11.4

v2: Patch revised to match the D425KT exactly as the D425KTW does have
LVDS.  According to Intel's documentation, the D410PTL and D410PLTW
don't.
