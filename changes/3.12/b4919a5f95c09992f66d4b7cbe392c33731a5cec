Tools: hv: fix send/recv buffer allocation

hv_kvp_daemon fails to start in current openSuSE 13.1 snapshots because
the kvp_send_buffer is too small to hold cn_msg+hv_kvp_msg, the very
first sendmsg returns with EFAULT. In addition it fixes the Network info
tab in Windows Server 2012R2 in SLES11.

Adjust the code in kvp and vss daemon to allocate the needed buffers at
runtime. To keep the code simple, the buffer_len includes also the
nlmsghdr, although only the recv_buffer needs this extra space.
