lockref: use arch_mutex_cpu_relax() in CMPXCHG_LOOP()

Make use of arch_mutex_cpu_relax() so architectures can override the
default cpu_relax() semantics.
This is especially useful for s390, where cpu_relax() means that we
yield() the current (virtual) cpu and therefore is very expensive,
and would contradict the whole purpose of the lockless cmpxchg loop.
