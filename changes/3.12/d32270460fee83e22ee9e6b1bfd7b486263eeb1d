    i915: bail out earlier when shrinker cannot acquire mutex

SHRINK_STOP was added to tell the core shrinker code to bail out and
go to the next shrinker since the i915 shrinker couldn't acquire
required locks. But the SHRINK_STOP return code was added to the
->count_objects callback and not the ->scan_objects callback as it
should have been, resulting in tons of dmesg noise like

shrink_slab: i915_gem_inactive_scan+0x0/0x9c negative objects to delete nr=-xxxxxxxxx

Fix discusssed with Dave Chinner.
