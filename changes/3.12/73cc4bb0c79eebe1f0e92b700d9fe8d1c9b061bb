xen/evtchn: improve scalability by using per-user locks

The global array of port users and the port_user_lock limits
scalability of the evtchn device.  Instead of the global array lookup,
use a per-use (per-fd) tree of event channels bound by that user and
protect the tree with a per-user lock.

This is also a prerequiste for extended the number of supported event
channels, by removing the fixed size, per-event channel array.
