mm/page_alloc.c: fix the value of fallback_migratetype in alloc_extfrag tracepoint()

In the current code, the value of fallback_migratetype that is printed
using the mm_page_alloc_extfrag tracepoint, is the value of the
migratetype *after* it has been set to the preferred migratetype (if the
ownership was changed).  Obviously that wouldn't have been the original
intent.  (We already have a separate 'change_ownership' field to tell
whether the ownership of the pageblock was changed from the
fallback_migratetype to the preferred type.)

The intent of the fallback_migratetype field is to show the migratetype
from which we borrowed pages in order to satisfy the allocation request.
So fix the code to print that value correctly.
