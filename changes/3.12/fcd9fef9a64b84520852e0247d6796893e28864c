perf annotate browser: Improve description of '?' hotkey

The previous description: "Search previous string" is usually associated
with the 'N' following a '/string', the opposite of 'n', which is
'Search next string' in the direction established with '/' or '?'.

So change it to 'Search string backwards', to clarify that.

The 'N' hotkey remains to be implemented with the semantic described
above.
