sfc: Eliminate struct efx_mtd

Currently we use struct efx_mtd to represent a physical NVRAM device
and struct efx_mtd_partition to represent a partition on that device.
But this only really makes sense for Falcon, as we don't know or care
whether MC-managed NVRAM partitions are on one or more physical
devices.  It complicates iteration and provides little benefit.
Therefore:

- Replace the pointer to efx_mtd in mtd_info::priv with a pointer to efx_nic
- Move the falcon_spi_device pointer into the union in struct efx_mtd_partition
- Move the device name to efx_mtd_partition::dev_type_name
- Move the efx_mtd_ops pointer to efx_nic::mtd_ops
- Make efx_nic::mtd_list a list of partitions
