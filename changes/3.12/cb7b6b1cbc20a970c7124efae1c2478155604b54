exec: cleanup the CONFIG_MODULES logic

search_binary_handler() uses "for (try=0; try<2; try++)" to avoid "goto"
but the code looks too complicated and horrible imho.  We still need to
check "try == 0" before request_module() and add the additional "break"
for !CONFIG_MODULES case.

Kill this loop and use a simple "bool need_retry" + "goto retry".  The
code looks much simpler and we do not even need ifdef's, gcc can optimize
out the "if (need_retry)" block if !IS_ENABLED().
