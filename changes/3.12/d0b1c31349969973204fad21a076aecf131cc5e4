[media] exynos-gsc: Register v4l2 device

Gscaler video device registration was happening without reference to
a parent v4l2_dev causing probe to fail. The patch creates a parent
v4l2 device and uses it for the gsc m2m video device registration.
This fixes regression introduced with comit commit 1c1d86a1ea07506
[media] v4l2: always require v4l2_dev, rename parent to dev_parent
