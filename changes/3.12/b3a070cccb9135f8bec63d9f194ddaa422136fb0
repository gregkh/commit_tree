drm: pre allocate node for create_block

For an upcoming patch where we introduce the i915 VMA, it's ideal to
have the drm_mm_node as part of the VMA struct (ie. it's pre-allocated).
Part of the conversion to VMAs is to kill off obj->gtt_space. Doing this
will break a bunch of code, but amongst them are 2 callers of
drm_mm_create_block(), both related to stolen memory.

It also allows us to embed the drm_mm_node into the object currently
which provides a nice transition over to the new code.

v2: Reordered to do before ripping out obj->gtt_offset.
Some minor cleanups made available because of reordering.

v3: s/continue/break on failed stolen node allocation (David)
Set obj->gtt_space on failed node allocation (David)
Only unref stolen (fix double free) on failed create_stolen (David)
Free node, and NULL it in failed create_stolen (David)
Add back accidentally removed newline (David)
