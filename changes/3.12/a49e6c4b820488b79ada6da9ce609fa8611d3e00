ARM: imx: add common clock support for fixup mux

One register may have several fields to control some clocks. It
is possible that the read/write values of some fields may map to
different real functional values, so writing to the other fields
in the same register may break a working clock tree. A real case
is the aclk_podf field in the register 'CCM Serial Clock Multiplexer
Register 1' of i.MX6Q/SDL SoC. This patch introduces a fixup hook
for multiplexer clock which is called before writing a value to
clock registers to support this kind of multiplexer clocks.
