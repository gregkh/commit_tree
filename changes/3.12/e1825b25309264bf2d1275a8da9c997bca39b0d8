cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: assign cpu_dev correctly to cpu0 device

Commit f837a9b5ab05c52a07108c6f09ca66f2e0aee757 "cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0:
remove device tree parsing for cpu nodes" assumed the pdev->dev is set to
cpu0 device in the platform code. But it actually points to the virtual
cpufreq-cpu0 platform device which is not present in the device tree.
Most of the information needed by cpufreq is stored in cpu0 DT node.
So cpu_dev must point to cpu0 device.

This patch fixes the wrong assignment to cpu_dev.
