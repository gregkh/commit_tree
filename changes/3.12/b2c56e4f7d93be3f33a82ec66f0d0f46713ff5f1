mm: shift VM_GROWS* check from mmap_region() to do_mmap_pgoff()

mmap() doesn't allow the non-anonymous mappings with VM_GROWS* bit set.
In particular this means that mmap_region()->vma_merge(file, vm_flags)
must always fail if "vm_flags & VM_GROWS" is set incorrectly.

So it does not make sense to check VM_GROWS* after we already allocated
the new vma, the only caller, do_mmap_pgoff(), which can pass this flag
can do the check itself.

And this looks a bit more correct, mmap_region() already unmapped the
old mapping at this stage. But if mmap() is going to fail, it should
avoid do_munmap() if possible.

Note: we check VM_GROWS at the end to ensure that do_mmap_pgoff() won't
return EINVAL in the case when it currently returns another error code.

Many thanks to Hugh who nacked the buggy v1.
