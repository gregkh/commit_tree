ARM: mvebu: add missing DT Mbus ranges and relocate PCIe DT nodes for RN102

When 5e12a613 and 0cd3754a were introduced, Netgear ReadyNAS 102 .dts
file was queued for inclusion and missed the update to have Mbus (and
then BootROM) ranges properties declared. It also missed the relocation
of Armada 370/XP PCIe DT nodes introduced by 14fd8ed0 after de1af8d4.
This patch fixes that which makes 3.12-rc3 bootable on the NAS.
