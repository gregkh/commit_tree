bonding: don't call slave_xxx_netpoll under spinlocks

The slave_xxx_netpoll will call synchronize_rcu_bh(),
so the function may schedule and sleep, it should't be
called under spinlocks.

bond_netpoll_setup() and bond_netpoll_cleanup() are always
protected by rtnl lock, it is no need to take the read lock,
as the slave list couldn't be changed outside rtnl lock.
