bonding: remove locking from bond_set_rx_mode()

We're already protected by RTNL lock, so nothing can happen to bond/its
slaves, and thus the locking is useless here (both bond->lock and
bond->curr_active_slave).

Also, add ASSERT_RTNL() both to bond_set_rx_mode() and bond_hw_addr_swap()
to catch possible uses of it without RTNL locking.

This patch also saves us from a lockdep false-positive in
bond_set_rx_mode() vs bond_hw_addr_swap().
