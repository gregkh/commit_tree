perf/x86: Clean up cap_user_time* setting

Currently the cap_user_time_zero capability has different tests than
cap_user_time; even though they expose the exact same data.

Switch from CONSTANT && NONSTOP to sched_clock_stable to also deal
with multi cabinet machines and drop the tsc_disabled() check.. non of
this will work sanely without tsc anyway.
