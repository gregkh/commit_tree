arm64: move elf notes into readonly segment

The current vmlinux.lds.S places the notes sections between the
end of rw data and start of bss. This means that _edata doesn't
really point to the end of data. Since notes are read-only, this
patch moves them to the read-only segment so that _edata does
point to the end of initialized rw data.
