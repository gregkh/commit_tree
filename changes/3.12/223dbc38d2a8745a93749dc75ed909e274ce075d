cgroup: bounce cgroup_subsys_state ref kill confirmation to a work item

css (cgroup_subsys_state) offlining, which requires process context,
will be moved to ref kill confirmation.  In preparation, bounce
css_killed handling through css->destroy_work.

css_ref_killed_fn() is renamed to css_killed_ref_fn() so that it's
consistent with the new css_killed_work_fn().

This patch adds an additional work item bouncing but doesn't change
the actual logic.
