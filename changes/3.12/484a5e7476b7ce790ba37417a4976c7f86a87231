perf annotate: Remove nop at end of annotation

When kcore is used for annotation, symbols do not have correct sizes
because they come from kallsyms, that has only its start address, with
the end address being the next symbol's minus one.

That sometimes results in an extra nop being seen after the end of a
function.  Remove it.
