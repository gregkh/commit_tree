ACPI / dock / PCI: Drop ACPI dock notifier chain

The only user of the ACPI dock notifier chain is the ACPI-based PCI
hotplug (acpiphp) driver that uses it to carry out post-dock fixups
needed by some systems with broken _DCK.  However, it is not
necessary to use a separate notifier chain for that, as it can be
simply replaced with a new callback in struct acpi_dock_ops.

For this reason, add a new .fixup() callback to struct acpi_dock_ops
and make hotplug_dock_devices() execute it for all dock devices with
hotplug operations registered.  Accordingly, make acpiphp point that
callback to the function carrying out the post-dock fixups and
do not register a separate dock notifier for each device
registering dock operations.  Finally, drop the ACPI dock notifier
chain that has no more users.
