migrate: add hugepage migration code to migrate_pages()

Extend check_range() to handle vma with VM_HUGETLB set.  We will be able
to migrate hugepage with migrate_pages(2) after applying the enablement
patch which comes later in this series.

Note that for larger hugepages (covered by pud entries, 1GB for x86_64 for
example), we simply skip it now.

Note that using pmd_huge/pud_huge assumes that hugepages are pointed to by
pmd/pud.  This is not true in some architectures implementing hugepage
with other mechanisms like ia64, but it's OK because pmd_huge/pud_huge
simply return 0 in such arch and page walker simply ignores such
hugepages.
