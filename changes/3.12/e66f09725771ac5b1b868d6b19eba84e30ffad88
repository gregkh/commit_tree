mm, page_alloc: add unlikely macro to help compiler optimization

We rarely allocate a page with ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS and it is used in slow
path.  For helping compiler optimization, add unlikely macro to
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS checking.

This patch doesn't have any effect now, because gcc already optimize this
properly.  But we cannot assume that gcc always does right and nobody
re-evaluate if gcc do proper optimization with their change, for example,
it is not optimized properly on v3.10.  So adding compiler hint here is
reasonable.
