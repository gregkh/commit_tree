x86, asm: Extend definitions of _ASM_* with a raw format

The __ASM_* macros (e.g. __ASM_DX) are used to return the proper
register name (e.g. edx for 32bit / rdx for 64bit). We want to use
this also in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h / get_user() .  For this
to work, we need a raw form as both gcc and clang choke on the
whitespace in a register asm() statement, and the __ASM_FORM macro
surrounds the argument with blanks.  A new macro, __ASM_FORM_RAW was
added and we change __ASM_REG to use the new RAW form.
