iwl4965: better skb management in rx path

4965 version of Eric patch "iwl3945: better skb management in rx path".
It fixes several problems :

1) skb->truesize is underestimated.
   We really consume PAGE_SIZE bytes for a fragment,
   not the frame length.
2) 128 bytes of initial headroom is a bit low and forces reallocations.
3) We can avoid consuming a full page for small enough frames.
