ext4: move test whether extent to map can be extended to one place

Currently the logic whether the current buffer can be added to an extent
of buffers to map is split between mpage_add_bh_to_extent() and
add_page_bufs_to_extent(). Move the whole logic to
mpage_add_bh_to_extent() which makes things a bit more straightforward
and make following i_size fixes easier.
