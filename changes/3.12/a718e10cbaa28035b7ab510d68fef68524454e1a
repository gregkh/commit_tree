tile: handle super huge pages in virt_to_pte

This tile-specific API had a minor bug, in that if a super huge (>4GB)
page mapped a particular address range, we wouldn't handle it correctly.
As part of fixing that bug, I also cleaned up some of the pud and pmd
accessors to make them more consistent.
