staging: wlags49_h2: remove sysfs file

The sysfs file in this driver is showing a raft of debugging values,
none of which belong in sysfs, let alone in a single sysfs file.  If
these really need to be described somewhere, they should go into
debugfs.

For now, just delete the sysfs file, which removes a bunch of files from
the tree.
