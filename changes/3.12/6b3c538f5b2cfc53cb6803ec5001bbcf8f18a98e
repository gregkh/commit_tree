exec: cleanup the error handling in search_binary_handler()

The error hanling and ret-from-loop look confusing and inconsistent.

- "retval >= 0" simply returns

- "!bprm->file" returns too but with read_unlock() because
   binfmt_lock was already re-acquired

- "retval != -ENOEXEC || bprm->mm == NULL" does "break" and
  relies on the same check after the main loop

Consolidate these checks into a single if/return statement.

need_retry still checks "retval == -ENOEXEC", but this and -ENOENT before
the main loop are not needed.  This is only for pathological and
impossible list_empty(&formats) case.

It is not clear why do we check "bprm->mm == NULL", probably this
should be removed.
