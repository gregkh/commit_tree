pci_ids.h: move PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC here

PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC is defined locally in
"drivers/staging/comedi/comedidev.h" for a few comedi hardware drivers,
namely "adl_pci9118", "addi_apci_1500" and "addi_apci_3120" (also
"addi_apci_1710" but that is not currently built and will probably be
removed soon).  Move the define into "include/linux/pci_ids.h" as it is
shared by several drivers (albeit all comedi drivers currently).

PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC happens to have the same value (0x10e8) as
PCI_VENDOR_ID_ADDIDATA_OLD.  The vendor ID is actually assigned to
Applied Micro Circuits Corporation and Addi-Data were using device IDs
assigned by AMCC on some of their earlier PCI boards. The
PCI_VENDOR_ID_ADDIDATA_OLD define is still being used by the "8250_pci"
PCI serial board driver.
