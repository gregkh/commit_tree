x86: Fix sys_call_table type in asm/syscall.h

Make the sys_call_table type defined in asm/syscall.h match
the definition in syscall_64.c

v2: include asm/syscall.h in syscall_64.c too. I left uml alone
because it doesn't have an syscall.h on its own and including
the native one leads to other errors.
