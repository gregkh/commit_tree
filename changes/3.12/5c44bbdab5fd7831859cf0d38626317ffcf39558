qlcnic: Fix VF reset recovery

o At the time of firmware hang "adapter->need_fw_reset" variable gets
  set but after re-initialization of firmware OR at the time of VF
  re-initialization that variable was not getting cleared which
  was leading to failure in VF reset recovery.Fix it by clearing
  this variable before re-initializing VF
