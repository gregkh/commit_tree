xtensa: don't use alternate signal stack on threads

According to create_thread(3): "The new thread does not inherit the creating
thread's alternate signal stack". Since commit f9a3879a (Fix sigaltstack
corruption among cloned threads), current->sas_ss_size is set to 0 for cloned
processes sharing VM with their parent. Don't use the (nonexistent) alternate
signal stack in this case. This has been broken since commit 29c4dfd9 ([XTENSA]
Remove non-rt signal handling).

Fixes the SA_ONSTACK part of the nptl/tst-cancel20 test from uClibc.
