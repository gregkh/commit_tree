mmc: sh_mmcif: revision-specific CLK_CTRL2 handling

Some newer MMCIF IP revisions contain a CE_CLK_CTRL2 register, that has to
be set for proper operation. Support for this feature is added in a way to
preserve the current behaviour by default, i.e. when it is not enabled
in platform data. Patch is based on work by Nobuyuki HIRAI.
