staging/lustre/fld: prepare FLD module for client server split

Split FLD server from client, fld_{handler,index}.c are not compliled
unless server support is enabled.  Do not include dt_object.h or
lustre_mdt.h in lustre_fld.h and fix the minor breakages caused by
this elsewhere.  Generally cleanup includes in lustre/fld.
