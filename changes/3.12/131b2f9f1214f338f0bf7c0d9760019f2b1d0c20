exec: kill "int depth" in search_binary_handler()

Nobody except search_binary_handler() should touch ->recursion_depth, "int
depth" buys nothing but complicates the code, kill it.

Probably we should also kill "fn" and the !NULL check, ->load_binary
should be always defined.  And it can not go away after read_unlock() or
this code is buggy anyway.
