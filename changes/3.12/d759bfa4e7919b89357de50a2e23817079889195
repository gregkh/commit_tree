udf: Standardize return values in mount sequence

Change all function used in filesystem discovery during mount to user
standard kernel return values - -errno on error, 0 on success instead
of 1 on failure and 0 on success. This allows us to pass error number
(not just failure / success) so we can abort device scanning earlier
in case of errors like EIO or ENOMEM . Also we will be able to return
EROFS in case writeable mount is requested but writing isn't supported.
