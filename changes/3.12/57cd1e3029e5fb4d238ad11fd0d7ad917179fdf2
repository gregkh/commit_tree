i2c: designware: get SDA hold time, HCNT and LCNT configuration from ACPI

Some Intel LPSS I2C devices make the SDA hold time and *CNT parameters
available via SSCN (standard mode) and FMCN (fast mode) ACPI methods.

Implement support for this so that we check whether an ACPI method exists
and if it does, fill in the SDA hold time and *CNT values to the device
private structure for core to use.
