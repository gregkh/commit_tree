HID: Correct the USB IDs for the new Macbook Air 6

A recent patch (9d9a04ee) added support for the new machine, but got
the sequence of USB ids wrong. Reports from both Ian and Linus T show
that the 0x0291 id is for ISO, not ANSI, which should have the missing
number 0x0290. This patchs moves the three numbers accordingly, fixing
the problem.
