exec: kill ->load_binary != NULL check in search_binary_handler()

search_binary_handler() checks ->load_binary != NULL for no reason, this
method should be always defined.  Turn this check into WARN_ON() and move
it into __register_binfmt().

Also, kill the function pointer.  The current code looks confusing, as if
->load_binary can go away after read_unlock(&binfmt_lock).  But we rely on
module_get(fmt->module), this fmt can't be changed or unregistered,
otherwise this code is buggy anyway.
