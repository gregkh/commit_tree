drm: hollow-out GET_CLIENT ioctl

We not only have debugfs files to do pretty much the equivalent of
lsof, we also have an ioctl. Not that compared to lsof this dumps a
wee bit more information, but we can still get at that from debugfs
easily.

I've dug around in mesa, libdrm and ddx histories and the only users
seem to be drm/tests/dristat.c and drm/tests/getclients.c. The later
is a testcase for the ioctl itself since up to

    drm: Make DRM_IOCTL_GET_CLIENT return EINVAL when it can't find client #idx

there was actually no way at all for userspace to enumerate all
clients since the kernel just wouldn't tell it when to stop. Which
completely broke it's only user, dristat -c.

So obviously that ioctl wasn't much use for debugging. Hence I don't
see any point in keeping support for a tool which was pretty obviously
never really used, and while we have good replacements in the form of
equivalent debugfs files.

Still, to keep dristat -c from looping forever again stop it early by
returning an unconditional -EINVAL. Also add a comment in the code
about why.

v2: Slightly less hollowed-out implementation. libva uses GET_CLIENTS
to figure out whether the fd it has is already authenticated or not.
So we need to keep that part of things working. Simplest way is to
just return one entry to keep va_drm_is_authenticated in
libva/va/drm/va_drm_auth.c working.

This is exercised by igt/drm_get_client_auth which contains a
copypasta of the libva auth check code.
