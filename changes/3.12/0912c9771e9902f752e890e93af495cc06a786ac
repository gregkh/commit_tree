KVM: x86: add comments where MMIO does not return to the emulator

Support for single-step in the emulator (new in 3.12) does not work for
MMIO or PIO writes, because they are completed without returning to
the emulator.  This is not worse than what we had in 3.11; still, add
comments so that the issue is not forgotten.
