acpi-cpufreq: Fail initialization if driver cannot be registered

Make acpi_cpufreq_init() return error codes when the driver cannot be
registered so that the module doesn't stay useless in memory and so
that acpi_cpufreq_exit() doesn't attempt to unregister things that
have never been registered when the module is unloaded.
