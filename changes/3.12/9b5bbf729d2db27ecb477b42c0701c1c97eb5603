tile: correct r1 value during syscall tracing

The r1 value is set based on the r0 value as we return to user space.
So tracing tools won't automatically see the right value.  Fix this by
generating the correct r1 value in do_syscall_trace_exit() rather
than trying to tamper with the hot path in syscall return.
