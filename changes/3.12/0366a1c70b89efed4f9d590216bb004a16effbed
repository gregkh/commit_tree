powerpc/irq: Run softirqs off the top of the irq stack

Nowadays, irq_exit() calls __do_softirq() pretty much directly
instead of calling do_softirq() which switches to the decicated
softirq stack.

This has lead to observed stack overflows on powerpc since we call
irq_enter() and irq_exit() outside of the scope that switches to
the irq stack.

This fixes it by moving the stack switching up a level, making
irq_enter() and irq_exit() run off the irq stack.
