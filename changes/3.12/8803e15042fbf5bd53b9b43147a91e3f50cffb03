sfc: Add flag for stack-owned RX MAC filters

MAC filters inserted on request from the stack (ndo_set_rx_mode)
should allow manual steering but not removal.  Currently we have a
special case for Siena's all-multicast and all-unicast MAC filters,
but on EF10 we need to allow for steering of precise MAC filters as
well.

The EFX_FILTER_FLAG_RX_STACK flag changes the behaviour of replacement
and removal requests:

- Replacement *of* a filter with this flag never clears the flag but
  does change steering and saved priority
- Replacement *by* a filter with this flag only sets the flag but does
  not change steering
- Removal with priority < EFX_FILTER_PRI_REQUIRED really resets RX
  steering and saved priority

This could support precise MAC filtering on Siena in future.

As a side-benefit, the default MAC filters are hidden from ethtool
until they are steered.
