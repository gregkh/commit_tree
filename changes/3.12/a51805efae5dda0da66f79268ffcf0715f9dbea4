lockdep: Introduce lock_acquire_exclusive()/shared() helper macros

In lockdep.h, the spinlock/mutex/rwsem/rwlock/lock_map acquire macros have
different definitions based on the value of CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING.  We have
separate ifdefs for each of these definitions, which seems redundant.

Introduce lock_acquire_{exclusive,shared,shared_recursive} helpers which
will have different definitions based on CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING.  Then all
other helper macros can be defined based on the above ones, which reduces
the amount of ifdefined code.
