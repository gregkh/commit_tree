perf trace: Handle perf.data files with no tracepoints

Before:

  perf trace -i perf.data
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  #

After:

 # perf trace -i perf.data
 Data file does not have raw_syscalls:sys_enter events
 #

When there are no tracepoints in a perf.data file the struct pevent
that contains the list of tracepoints that will be used to lookup the
tracepoint id by name will not be populated, causing a NULL deref.

And we don't need to do all that dance to look at pevents for an entry
with a slighly different name to then lookup the tracepoint by its id on
the evlist, just use the perf_evlist__find_tracepoint_by_name() routine,
that will find the tracepoint, if present.
