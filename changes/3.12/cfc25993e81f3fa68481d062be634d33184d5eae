Drivers: hv: remove HV_DRV_VERSION

Remove HV_DRV_VERSION, it has no meaning for upstream drivers.

Initially it was supposed to show the "Linux Integration Services"
version, now it is not in sync anymore with the out-of-tree drivers
available from the MSFT website.

The only place where a version string is still required is the KVP
command "IntegrationServicesVersion" which is handled by
tools/hv/hv_kvp_daemon.c. To satisfy such KVP request from the host pass
the current string to the daemon during KVP userland registration.
