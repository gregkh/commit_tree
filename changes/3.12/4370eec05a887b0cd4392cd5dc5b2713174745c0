arm64: Expand arm64 image header

Expand the arm64 image header to allow for co-existance with
PE/COFF header required by the EFI stub.  The PE/COFF format
requires the "MZ" header to be at offset 0, and the offset
to the PE/COFF header to be at offset 0x3c.  The image
header is expanded to allow 2 instructions at the beginning
to accommodate a benign intruction at offset 0 that includes
the "MZ" header, a magic number, and the offset to the PE/COFF
header.
