net: sctp: rfc4443: do not report ICMP redirects to user space

Adapt the same behaviour for SCTP as present in TCP for ICMP redirect
messages. For IPv6, RFC4443, section 2.4. says:

  ...
  (e) An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be originated as a result of
      receiving the following:
  ...
       (e.2) An ICMPv6 redirect message [IPv6-DISC].
  ...

Therefore, do not report an error to user space, just invoke dst's redirect
callback and leave, same for IPv4 as done in TCP as well. The implication
w/o having this patch could be that the reception of such packets would
generate a poll notification and in worst case it could even tear down the
whole connection. Therefore, stop updating sk_err on redirects.
