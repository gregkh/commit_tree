tile: support CONFIG_PREEMPT

This change adds support for CONFIG_PREEMPT (full kernel preemption).
In addition to the core support, this change includes a number
of places where we fix up uses of smp_processor_id() and per-cpu
variables.  I also eliminate the PAGE_HOME_HERE and PAGE_HOME_UNKNOWN
values for page homing, as it turns out they weren't being used.
