kvm/ppc: Call trace_hardirqs_on before entry

Currently this is only being done on 64-bit.  Rather than just move it
out of the 64-bit ifdef, move it to kvm_lazy_ee_enable() so that it is
consistent with lazy ee state, and so that we don't track more host
code as interrupts-enabled than necessary.

Rename kvm_lazy_ee_enable() to kvm_fix_ee_before_entry() to reflect
that this function now has a role on 32-bit as well.
