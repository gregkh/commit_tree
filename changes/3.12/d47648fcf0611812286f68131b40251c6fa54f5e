raid5: avoid finding "discard" stripe

SCSI discard will damage discard stripe bio setting, eg, some fields are
changed. If the stripe is reused very soon, we have wrong bios setting. We
remove discard stripe from hash list, so next time the strip will be fully
initialized.

Suitable for backport to 3.7+.
