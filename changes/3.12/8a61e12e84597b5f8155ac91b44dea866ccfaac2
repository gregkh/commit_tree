acpi-cpufreq: skip loading acpi_cpufreq after intel_pstate

If the hw supports intel_pstate and acpi_cpufreq, intel_pstate will
get loaded first.

acpi_cpufreq_init() will call acpi_cpufreq_early_init()
and that will allocate perf data and init those perf data in ACPI core,
(that will cover all CPUs). But later it will free them as
cpufreq_register_driver(acpi_cpufreq) will fail as intel_pstate is
already registered

Use cpufreq_get_current_driver() to check if we can skip the
acpi_cpufreq loading.
