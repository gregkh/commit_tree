watchdog: hpwdt: Patch to ignore auxilary iLO devices

This patch is to prevent hpwdt from loading on any auxilary iLO devices defined
after the initial (or main) iLO device. All auxilary iLO devices will have a
subsystem device ID set to 0x1979 in order for hpwdt to differentiate between
the two types.
