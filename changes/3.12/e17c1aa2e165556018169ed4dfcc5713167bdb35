USB: ftdi_sio: remove vendor/product module parameters

Remove the vendor and product module parameters which were added a long
time ago when we did not have the dynamic sysfs interface to add
new device ids (and which isn't limited to a single new vid/pid pair).

A vid/pid pair can be added dynamically using sysfs, for example:

	echo 0403 1234 >/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id

Also fix up the in-code comment that got the sysfs path wrong.
