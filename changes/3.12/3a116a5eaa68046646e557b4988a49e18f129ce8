ARM: shmobile: lager: Do not use register_type field of struct sh_eth_plat_data

As of 8d3214c ("sh_eth: remove 'register_type' field from 'struct
sh_eth_plat_data'") is is no longer necessary or correct to use the
'register_type' field from 'struct sh_eth_plat_data' and doing so results
in a build error.
