dm stats: fix possible counter corruption on 32-bit systems

There was a deliberate race condition in dm_stat_for_entry() to avoid the
overhead of disabling and enabling interrupts.  The race could result in
some events not being counted on 64-bit architectures.

However, on 32-bit architectures, operations on long long variables are
not atomic, so the race condition could cause the counter to jump by 2^32.
Such jumps could be disruptive, so we need to do proper locking on 32-bit
architectures.
