USBNET: fix handling padding packet

Commit 638c5115a7949(USBNET: support DMA SG) introduces DMA SG
if the usb host controller is capable of building packet from
discontinuous buffers, but missed handling padding packet when
building DMA SG.

This patch attachs the pre-allocated padding packet at the
end of the sg list, so padding packet can be sent to device
if drivers require that.
