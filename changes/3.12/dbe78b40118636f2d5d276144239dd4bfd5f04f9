powerpc/pseries: Do not start secondaries in Open Firmware

Starting secondary CPUs early on from Open Firmware and placing them
in a holding spin loop slows down the boot process significantly under
some hypervisors such as KVM.

This is also unnecessary when RTAS supports querying the CPU state

So let's not do it.
