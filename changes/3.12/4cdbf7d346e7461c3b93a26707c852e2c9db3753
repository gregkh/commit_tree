i2c: omap: Clear ARDY bit twice

Initially commit cb527ede1bf6ff2008a025606f25344b8ed7b4ac
"i2c-omap: Double clear of ARDY status in IRQ handler"
added a workaround for undocumented errata ProDB0017052.
But then commit 1d7afc95946487945cc7f5019b41255b72224b70
"i2c: omap: ack IRQ in parts" refactored code and missed
one of ARDY clearings. So current code violates errata.
It causes often i2c bus timeouts on my Pandaboard.

This patch adds a second clearing in place.
