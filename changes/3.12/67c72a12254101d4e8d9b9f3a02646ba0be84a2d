    drm/i915: set up PIPECONF explicitly for i9xx/vlv platforms

Ville brough up the idea that this is just the pipe A quirk gone
wrong.

Note that after resume the bios might or might not have enabled pipe A
already.  We have a bit of magic to make sure that on resume we set up
a decent mode for pipe A, but I fear if I just smash pipe A to always
on we'd enable it in a bogus state and hang the hw. Hence the
readback.

v2: Clarify the logic a bit as suggested by Chris. Also amend the
commit message to clarify why we don't unconditionally enable the
pipe.
