sctp: Don't lookup dst if transport dst is still valid

When sctp sits on IPv6, sctp_transport_dst_check pass cookie as ZERO,
as a result ip6_dst_check always fail out. This behaviour makes
transport->dst useless, because every sctp_packet_transmit must look
for valid dst.

Add a dst_cookie into sctp_transport, and set the cookie whenever we
get new dst for sctp_transport. So dst validness could be checked
against it.

Since I have split genid for IPv4 and IPv6, also delete/add IPv6 address
will also bump IPv6 genid. So issues we discussed in:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=137404469219410&w=4
have all been sloved for this patch.
