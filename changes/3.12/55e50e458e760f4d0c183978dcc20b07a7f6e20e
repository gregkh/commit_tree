Btrfs: do not add replace target to the alloc_list

If replace was suspended by the umount, replace target device is added
to the fs_devices->alloc_list during a later mount.  This is obviously
wrong.  ->is_tgtdev_for_dev_replace is supposed to guard against that,
but ->is_tgtdev_for_dev_replace is (and can only ever be) initialized
*after* everything is opened and fs_devices lists are populated.  Fix
this by checking the devid instead: for replace targets it's always
equal to BTRFS_DEV_REPLACE_DEVID.
