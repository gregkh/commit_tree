split read_seqretry_or_unlock(), convert d_walk() to resulting primitives

Separate "check if we need to retry" from "unlock if we are done and
had seq_writelock"; that allows to use these guys in d_walk(), where
we need to recheck every time we ascend back to parent, but do *not*
want to unlock until the very end.  Lift rcu_read_lock/rcu_read_unlock
out into callers.
