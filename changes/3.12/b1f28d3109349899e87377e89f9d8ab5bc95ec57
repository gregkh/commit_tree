cgroup: fix error path of cgroup_addrm_files()

cgroup_addrm_files() mishandled error return value from
cgroup_add_file() and returns error iff the last file fails to create.
As we're in the process of cleaning up file add/rm error handling and
will reliably propagate file creation failures, there's no point in
keeping adding files after a failure.

Replace the broken error collection logic with immediate error return.
While at it, add lockdep assertions and function comment.
