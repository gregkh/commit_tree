crypto: nx - fix XCBC for zero length messages

The NX XCBC implementation doesn't support zero length messages and
because of that NX is currently returning a hard-coded hash for zero
length messages. However this approach is incorrect since the hash value
also depends on which key is used.

This patch removes the hard-coded hash and replace it with an
implementation based on the RFC 3566 using ECB.
