perf/x86: Add ability to calculate TSC from perf sample timestamps

For modern CPUs, perf clock is directly related to TSC.  TSC
can be calculated from perf clock and vice versa using a simple
calculation.  Two of the three componenets of that calculation
are already exported in struct perf_event_mmap_page.  This patch
exports the third.
