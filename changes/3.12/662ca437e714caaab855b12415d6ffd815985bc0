tuntap: correctly handle error in tun_set_iff()

Commit c8d68e6be1c3b242f1c598595830890b65cea64a
(tuntap: multiqueue support) only call free_netdev() on error in
tun_set_iff(). This causes several issues:

- memory of tun security were leaked
- use after free since the flow gc timer was not deleted and the tfile
  were not detached

This patch solves the above issues.
