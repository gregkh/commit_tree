bridge: Fix updating FDB entries when the PVID is applied

We currently set the value that variable vid is pointing, which will be
used in FDB later, to 0 at br_allowed_ingress() when we receive untagged
or priority-tagged frames, even though the PVID is valid.
This leads to FDB updates in such a wrong way that they are learned with
VID 0.
Update the value to that of PVID if the PVID is applied.
