dma: edma: Write out and handle MAX_NR_SG at a given time

Process SG-elements in batches of MAX_NR_SG if they are greater
than MAX_NR_SG. Due to this, at any given time only those many
slots will be used in the given channel no matter how long the
scatter list is. We keep track of how much has been written
inorder to process the next batch of elements in the scatter-list
and detect completion.

For such intermediate transfer completions (one batch of MAX_NR_SG),
make use of pause and resume functions instead of start and stop
when such intermediate transfer is in progress or completed as we
donot want to clear any pending events.
