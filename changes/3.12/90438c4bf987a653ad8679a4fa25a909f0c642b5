spi: s3c64xx: Use dmaengine_prep_slave_single() to prepare DMA transfers

Since the driver supports only contiguous buffers, there is no need to
manually construct a scatterlist with just a single entry, when there is
a dedicated helper for this purpose.

This patch modifies prepare_dma() function to use available helper instead
of manually creating a scatterlist.
