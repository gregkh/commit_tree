ALSA: hda - hdmi: Fix channel map switch not taking effect

Currently hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe() reprograms the HDA channel
mapping only when the infoframe is not up-to-date or the non-PCM flag
has changed.

However, when just the channel map has been changed, the infoframe may
still be up-to-date and non-PCM flag may not have changed, so the new
channel map is not actually programmed into the HDA codec.

Notably, this failing case is also always triggered when the device is
already in a prepared state and a new channel map is configured while
changing only the channel positions (for example, plain
"speaker-test -c2 -m FR,FL").

Fix that by always programming the channel map in
hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe(). Tested on Intel HDMI.
