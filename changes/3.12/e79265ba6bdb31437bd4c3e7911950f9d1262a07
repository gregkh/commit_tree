mtd: ofpart: add compatible check for child nodes

In case that the nand device will support some features like Nand Flash
Controller, we want to make the sub feature as a sub node of nand device.

Use such organization it is easy to enable/disable feature, also it is back
compatible and more readable.

If the sub-node has a compatible property then it is a driver not partition.
