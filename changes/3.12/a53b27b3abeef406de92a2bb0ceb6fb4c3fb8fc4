powerpc/perf: Fix handling of FAB events

Commit 4df4899 "Add power8 EBB support" included a bug in the handling
of the FAB_CRESP_MATCH and FAB_TYPE_MATCH fields.

These values are pulled out of the event code using EVENT_THR_CTL_SHIFT,
however we were then or'ing that value directly into MMCR1.

This meant we were failing to set the FAB fields correctly, and also
potentially corrupting the value for PMC4SEL. Leading to no counts for
the FAB events and incorrect counts for PMC4.

The fix is simply to shift left the FAB value correctly before or'ing it
with MMCR1.
