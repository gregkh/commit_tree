net: make snmp_mib_free static inline

Fengguang reported:

   net/built-in.o: In function `in6_dev_finish_destroy':
   (.text+0x4ca7d): undefined reference to `snmp_mib_free'

this is due to snmp_mib_free() is defined when CONFIG_INET is enabled,
but in6_dev_finish_destroy() is now moved to core kernel.

I think snmp_mib_free() is small enough to be inlined, so just make it
static inline.
