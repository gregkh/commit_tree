drm/i915: Track when an object is pinned for use by the display engine

The display engine has unique coherency rules such that it requires
special handling to ensure that all writes to cursors, scanouts and
sprites are clflushed. This patch introduces the infrastructure to
simply track when an object is being accessed by the display engine.

v2: Explain the is_pin_display() magic as the sources for obj->pin_count
and their individual rules is not obvious. (Ville)
