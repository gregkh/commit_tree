drivers/net: enic: Generate notification of hardware crash

This patch generates a hardware crash notification (NETDEV_REBOOT)
during reset. After a hardware crash, ENIC resets all its resources
including queue pair filters programmed by USNIC. USNIC registers for
this notification, and on receiving it, reprograms the queue pair
filters.
