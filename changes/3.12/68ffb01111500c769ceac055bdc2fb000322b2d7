xhci: trace debug statements related to ring expansion

This patch defines a new trace event, which is called xhci_dbg_ring_expansion
and belongs to the event class xhci_log_msg, and adds tracepoints that trace
the debug messages associated with the expansion of endpoint ring when there
is not enough space allocated to hold all pending TRBs.
