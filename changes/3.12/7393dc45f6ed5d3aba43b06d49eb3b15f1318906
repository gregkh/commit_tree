revert "mm/memory-hotplug: fix lowmem count overflow when offline pages"

This reverts commit cea27eb2a202 ("mm/memory-hotplug: fix lowmem count
overflow when offline pages").

The fixed bug by commit cea27eb was fixed to another way by commit
3dcc0571cd64 ("mm: correctly update zone->managed_pages").  That commit
enhances memory_hotplug.c to adjust totalhigh_pages when hot-removing
memory, for details please refer to:

As a result, commit cea27eb2a202 currently causes duplicated decreasing
of totalhigh_pages, thus the revert.
