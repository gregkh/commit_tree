drm/i915: Hook PSR functionality

PSR must be enabled after transcoder and port are running.
And it is only available for HSW.

v2: move enable/disable to intel_ddi
v3: The spec suggests PSR should be disabled even before backlight (by pzanoni)
v4: also disabling and enabling whenever panel is disabled/enabled.
v5: make it last patch to avoid breaking whenever bisecting. So calling for
    update and force exit came to this patch along with enable/disable calls.
v6: Remove unused and unecessary psr_enable/disable calls, as notice by Paulo.

[danvet: Drop the psr exit code in the busy ioctl since I didn't merge
that part of the infrastructure yet - it needs more thought.]
