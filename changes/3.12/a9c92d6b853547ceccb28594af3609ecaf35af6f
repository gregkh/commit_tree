NFS: Common versions of sequence helper functions

NFSv4.0 will have need for this functionality when I add the ability
to block NFSv4.0 traffic before migration recovery.

I'm not really clear on why nfs4_set_sequence_privileged() gets a
generic name, but nfs41_init_sequence() gets a minor
version-specific name.
