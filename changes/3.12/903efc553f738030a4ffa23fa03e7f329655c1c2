clk: fix new_parent dereference before null check

Commit 71472c0 (clk: add support for clock reparent on set_rate) added a
dereference of the new_parent pointer in clk_reparent(), but as detected
by smatch clk_reparent() later checks whether new_parent is NULL.

The dereference was in order to clear the new parent's new_child pointer
to avoid duplicate POST_RATE_CHANGE notifications, so clearly isn't
necessary if the new parent is NULL, so move it inside the "if
(new_parent)" block.
