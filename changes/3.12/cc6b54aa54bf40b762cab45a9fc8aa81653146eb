HID: validate feature and input report details

When dealing with usage_index, be sure to properly use unsigned instead of
int to avoid overflows.

When working on report fields, always validate that their report_counts are
in bounds.
Without this, a HID device could report a malicious feature report that
could trick the driver into a heap overflow:

[  634.885003] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0596, idProduct=0500
...
[  676.469629] BUG kmalloc-192 (Tainted: G        W   ): Redzone overwritten

CVE-2013-2897
