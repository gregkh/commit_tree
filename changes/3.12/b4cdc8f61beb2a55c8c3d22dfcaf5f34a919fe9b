serial: imx: add DMA support for imx6q

We only enable the DMA support when the following are meet:

  [1] The uart port supports the hardware flow control(CTS/RTS).
      (Some uart port does not support the CTS/RTS.)

  [2] The application enables the CTS/RTS.

  [3] The Soc is imx6q.
      For the sdma's firmware limit, we do not support the DMA except
      the imx6q platform.

  [4] The uart is not used as a console.
