mm: soft-offline: use migrate_pages() instead of migrate_huge_page()

Currently migrate_huge_page() takes a pointer to a hugepage to be migrated
as an argument, instead of taking a pointer to the list of hugepages to be
migrated.  This behavior was introduced in commit 189ebff28 ("hugetlb:
simplify migrate_huge_page()"), and was OK because until now hugepage
migration is enabled only for soft-offlining which migrates only one
hugepage in a single call.

But the situation will change in the later patches in this series which
enable other users of page migration to support hugepage migration.  They
can kick migration for both of normal pages and hugepages in a single
call, so we need to go back to original implementation which uses linked
lists to collect the hugepages to be migrated.

With this patch, soft_offline_huge_page() switches to use migrate_pages(),
and migrate_huge_page() is not used any more.  So let's remove it.
