i2c: pnx: add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions

Add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions to fix the following
build warning when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not selected. This is because
sleep PM callbacks defined by SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS are only used when
the CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled.

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-pnx.c:599:12: warning: 'i2c_pnx_controller_suspend' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-pnx.c:608:12: warning: 'i2c_pnx_controller_resume' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
