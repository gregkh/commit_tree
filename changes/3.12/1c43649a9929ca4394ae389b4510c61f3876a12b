tile PCI RC: restructure TRIO initialization

The TRIO shim initialization is shared with other kernel drivers
such as the endpoint and StreamIO drivers, so reorganize the
initialization flow to ensure that the root complex driver properly
initializes TRIO state regardless of what kind of TRIO driver will
end up using the shim.
