clocksource: sun4i: Fix bug when switching from periodic to oneshot modes

The interval was firing at was set up at probe time, and only changed in
the set_next_event, and never changed back, which is not really what is
expected.

When enabling the periodic mode, now set an interval to tick every
jiffy.
