cgroup: fix cgroup_write_event_control()

81eeaf0411 ("cgroup: make cftype->[un]register_event() deal with
cgroup_subsys_state inst ead of cgroup") updated the cftype event
methods to take @css (cgroup_subsys_state) instead of @cgroup;
however, it incorrectly used @css passed to
cgroup_write_event_control(), which the dummy_css for the cgroup as
the file is a cgroup core file.  This leads to oops on event
registration.

Fix it by using the css matching the event target file.  Note that
cgroup_write_event_control() now disallows cgroup core files from
being event sources.  This is for simplicity and doesn't matter as
cgroup_event will be moved and made specific to memcg.
