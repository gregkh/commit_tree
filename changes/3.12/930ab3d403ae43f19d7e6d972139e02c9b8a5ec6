i2c: mv64xxx: Add I2C Transaction Generator support

The I2C Transaction Generator offloads CPU from managing I2C
transfer step by step.

This feature is currently only available on Armada XP, so usage of
this mechanism is activated through device tree.

Based on the work of Piotr Ziecik and rewrote to use the new way of
handling multiples i2c messages.
