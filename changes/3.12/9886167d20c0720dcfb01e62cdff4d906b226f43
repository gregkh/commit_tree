perf: Fix perf_pmu_migrate_context

While auditing the list_entry usage due to a trinity bug I found that
perf_pmu_migrate_context violates the rules for
perf_event::event_entry.

The problem is that perf_event::event_entry is a RCU list element, and
hence we must wait for a full RCU grace period before re-using the
element after deletion.

Therefore the usage in perf_pmu_migrate_context() which re-uses the
entry immediately is broken. For now introduce another list_head into
perf_event for this specific usage.

This doesn't actually fix the trinity report because that never goes
through this code.
