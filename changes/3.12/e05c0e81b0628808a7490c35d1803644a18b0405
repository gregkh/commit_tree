powerpc: split She math emulation into two parts

For some SoC (such as the FSL BookE) even though there does have
a hardware FPU, but not all floating point instructions are
implemented. Unfortunately some versions of gcc do use these
unimplemented instructions. Then we have to enable the math emulation
to workaround this issue. It seems a little redundant to have the
support to emulate all the floating point instructions in this case.
So split the math emulation into two parts. One is for the SoC which
doesn't have FPU at all and the other for the SoC which does have the
hardware FPU and only need some special floating point instructions to
be emulated.
