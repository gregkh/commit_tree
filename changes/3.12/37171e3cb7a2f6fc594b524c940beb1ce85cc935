drivers: base: remove improper get/put in add_memory_section()

The path through add_memory_section() when the memory block already
exists uses flawed refcounting logic.  A get_device() is done on a
memory block using a pointer that might not be valid as we dropped
our previous reference and didn't obtain a new reference in the
proper way.

Lets stop pretending and just remove the get/put.  The
mem_sysfs_mutex, which we hold over the entire init loop now, will
prevent the memory blocks from disappearing from under us.
