mtd: m25p80: Fix 4 byte addressing mode for Micron devices.

According to the datasheet for Micron n25q256a (N25Q256A13ESF40F) 4-byte
addressing mode should be entered as follows:

<quote>
To enter or exit the 4-byte address mode, the WRITE ENABLE command
must be executed to set the write enable latch bit to 1. (Note: The
WRITE ENABLE command must NOT be executed on the N25Q256A83ESF40x and
N25Q256A83E1240x devices.) S# must be driven LOW. The effect of the
command is immediate; after the command has been executed, the write
enable latch bit is cleared to 0.

Micron's portable way to perform this for all types of Micron flash
is to first issue a write enable, then switch the addressing mode
followed by a write disable to avoid leaving the flash in a write-
able state.
