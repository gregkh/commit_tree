perf annotate: Allow disassembly using /proc/kcore

Annotation with /proc/kcore is possible so the logic is adjusted to
allow it.  The main difference is that /proc/kcore had no symbols so the
parsing logic needed a tweak to read jump offsets.

The other difference is that objdump cannot always read from kcore.
That seems to be a bug with objdump.
