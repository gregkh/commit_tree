mm/hotplug, x86: Disable ARCH_MEMORY_PROBE by default

CONFIG_ARCH_MEMORY_PROBE enables the
/sys/devices/system/memory/probe interface, which allows a given
memory address to be hot-added as follows:

 # echo start_address_of_new_memory > /sys/devices/system/memory/probe

(See Documentation/memory-hotplug.txt for more details.)

This probe interface is required on powerpc. On x86, however,
ACPI notifies a memory hotplug event to the kernel, which
performs its hotplug operation as the result.

Therefore, regular users do not need this interface on x86. This probe
interface is also error-prone and misleading that the kernel blindly
adds a given memory address without checking if the memory is present
on the system; no probing is done despite of its name.

The kernel crashes when a user requests to online a memory block
that is not present on the system. This interface is currently
used for testing as it can fake a hotplug event.

This patch disables CONFIG_ARCH_MEMORY_PROBE by default on x86,
adds its Kconfig menu entry on x86, and clarifies its use in
Documentation/ memory-hotplug.txt.
