qlcnic: use standard NAPI weights

Since commit 82dc3c63 ("net: introduce NAPI_POLL_WEIGHT")
netif_napi_add() produces an error message if a NAPI poll weight
greater than 64 is requested.

qlcnic requests the weight as large as 256 for some of its rings, and
smaller values for other rings. For instance in qlcnic_82xx_napi_add()
I think the intention was to give the tx+rx ring a bigger weight than
to rx-only rings, but it's actually doing the opposite. So I'm assuming
the weights do not really matter much.

Just use the standard NAPI weights for all rings.
