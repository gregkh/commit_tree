NFC: pn533: Add some polling entropy

By not always starting the polling loop from the same modulation, we
avoid entering infinite loops where devices exporting 2 targets (on 2
different modulations) get the same target activated over and over.
If this target is not readable (e.g. a wallet emulating a tag), we will
stay in an error loop for ever.
