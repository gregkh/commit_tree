drm/tilcdc fixup mode to workaround sync for tda998x

Add a fixup function that will flip the hsync priority and
add a hskew value that is used to shift the tda998x to the
right by a variable number of pixels depending on the mode.
This works around an issue with the sync timings that tilcdc
is outputing.
