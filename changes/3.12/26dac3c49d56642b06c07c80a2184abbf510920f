uio: Remove uio_pdrv and use uio_pdrv_genirq instead

The patch "UIO: fix uio_pdrv_genirq with device tree but no interrupt"
(sha1: e3a3c3a205554e564751cd9c0276b2af813d7a92)
add support to use this driver with no interrupts.
uio_pdrv_genirq also supports device-tree binding
which is not available in uio_pdrv.

That's why this uio_pdrv driver can be just removed.
