ARM: 7842/1: MCPM: don't explode if invoked without being initialized first

Currently mcpm_cpu_power_down() and mcpm_cpu_suspend() trigger BUG()
if mcpm_platform_register() is not called beforehand.  This may occur
for many reasons such as some incomplete device tree passed to the kernel
or the like.

Let's be nicer to users and avoid killing the kernel if that happens by
logging a warning and returning to the caller.  The mcpm_cpu_suspend()
user is already set to deal with this situation, and so is cpu_die()
invoking mcpm_cpu_die().

The problematic case would have been the B.L switcher's usage of
mcpm_cpu_power_down(), however it has to call mcpm_cpu_power_up() first
which is already set to catch an error resulting from a missing
mcpm_platform_register() call.
