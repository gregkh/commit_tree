arm64: avoid multiple evaluation of ptr in get_user/put_user()

get_user() is defined as a function macro in arm64, and trace_get_user()
calls it as followed:
     get_user(ch, ptr++);
Since the second parameter occurs twice in the definition, 'ptr++' is
unexpectedly evaluated twice and trace_get_user() will generate a bogus
string from user-provided one. As a result, some ftrace sysfs operations,
like "echo FUNCNAME > set_ftrace_filter," hit this case and eventually fail.
This patch fixes the issue both in get_user() and put_user().
