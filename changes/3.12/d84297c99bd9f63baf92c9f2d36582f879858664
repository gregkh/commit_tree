rcu: Fix rcu_barrier() documentation

There was a time when rcu_barrier() was guaranteed to wait for at least
a grace period, but that time ended due to energy-efficiency concerns.
So now rcu_barrier() is a no-op if there are no RCU callbacks queued in
the system.  This commit updates the documentation to reflect this change.

Now, rcu_barrier() often does wait for a grace period, so, one could
imagine some modification to rcu_barrier() to more efficiently handle
cases where both rcu_barrier() and a grace period are needed.  But this
must wait until someone shows a real-world need for a change.
