checkpatch: check CamelCase by word, not by $Lval

$Lval is a test for complete name (ie: foo->bar.Baz[1])

If any of this is CamelCase, then the current test uses the entire $Lval.
This isn't optimal because it can emit messages with foo->bar.Baz and
bar.Baz when Baz is a variable specified in an include file.

So instead, break the $Lval into words and check each word for CamelCase
uses.
