i2c: pxa: enable high speed mode for i2c bus

To enter high speed mode, following steps should be done:
1. When running in high speed mode, i2c clock rate is different
from standard mode. Clock rate must be set according to
specification first.
2. When i2c controller sends a master code and wins arbitration,
high speed mode is entered.

If you want to enable high speed mode, the following members of
platform data should be set to proper value:
1. "high_mode" should be set to "1".
2. "master_code" should be set to "8'b 0000_1xxx"(x is 0 or 1).
   If no master_code is set, set to default value 0xe.
3. "rate" should be set according to specification.
