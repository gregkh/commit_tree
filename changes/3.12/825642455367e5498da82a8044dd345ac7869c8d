i2c: designware: Manually set RESTART bit between messages

If both IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN and IC_RESTART_EN are set to 1, the
Designware I2C controller doesn't generate RESTART unless user specifically
requests it by setting RESTART bit in IC_DATA_CMD register.

Since IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN setting can't be detected from hardware
register, we must always manually set the restart bit between messages.
