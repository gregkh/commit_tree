Revert "powerpc/e500: Update compilation flags with core specific options"

This reverts commit c8db32c8669f7de05b820ee4934926405af52188.

The commit breaks the build of all my 64-bit embedded configs. It
looks like gcc-4.7.3 doesn't know about e5500. Additionally it
incorrectly does -mcpu=e5500 on a config that has both e5500 and A2
support enabled.
