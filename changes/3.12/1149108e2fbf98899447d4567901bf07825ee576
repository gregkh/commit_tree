can: mscan: improve clock API use

the .get_clock() callback is run from probe() and might allocate
resources, introduce a .put_clock() callback that is run from remove()
to undo any allocation activities

prepare and enable the clocks in open(), disable and unprepare the
clocks in close() if clocks were acquired during probe(), to not assume
knowledge about which activities are done in probe() and remove()

use devm_get_clk() to lookup the SYS and REF clocks, to have the clocks
put upon device shutdown

store pointers to data structures upon successful allocation already
instead of deferral until complete setup, such that subroutines in the
setup sequence may access those data structures as well to track their
resource acquisition

since clock allocation remains optional, the release callback as well as
the enable/disable calls in open/close are optional as well
