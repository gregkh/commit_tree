bonding: factor out slave id tx code and simplify xmit paths

I factored out the tx xmit code which relies on slave id in
bond_xmit_slave_id. It is global because later it can be used also in
3ad mode xmit. Unnecessary obvious comments are removed. Active-backup
mode is simplified because bond_dev_queue_xmit always consumes the skb.
bond_xmit_xor becomes one line because of bond_xmit_slave_id.
bond_for_each_slave_from is not used in bond_xmit_slave_id because later
when RCU is used we can avoid important race condition by using standard
rculist routines.
