dm: lower bio-based mempool reservation

Bio-based device mapper processing doesn't need larger mempools (like
request-based DM does), so lower the number of reserved entries for
bio-based operation.  16 was already used for bio-based DM's bioset
but mistakenly wasn't used for it's _io_cache.

Formalize difference between bio-based and request-based defaults by
introducing RESERVED_BIO_BASED_IOS and RESERVED_REQUEST_BASED_IOS.
