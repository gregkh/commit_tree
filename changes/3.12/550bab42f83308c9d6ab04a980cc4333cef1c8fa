ipv6: fill rt6i_gateway with nexthop address

Make sure rt6i_gateway contains nexthop information in
all routes returned from lookup or when routes are directly
attached to skb for generated ICMP packets.

The effect of this patch should be a faster version of
rt6_nexthop() and the consideration of local addresses as
nexthop.
