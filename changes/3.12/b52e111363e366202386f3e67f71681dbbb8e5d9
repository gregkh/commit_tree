Revert "pl2303: improve the chip type information output on startup"

This reverts commit a77a8c23e4db9fb1f776147eda0d85117359c700.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
