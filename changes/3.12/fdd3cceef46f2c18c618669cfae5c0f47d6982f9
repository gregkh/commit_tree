xfs: factor all the kmalloc-or-vmalloc fallback allocations

We have quite a few places now where we do:

	x = kmem_zalloc(large size)
	if (!x)
		x = kmem_zalloc_large(large size)

and do a similar dance when freeing the memory. kmem_free() already
does the correct freeing dance, and kmem_zalloc_large() is only ever
called in these constructs, so just factor it all into
kmem_zalloc_large() and kmem_free().
