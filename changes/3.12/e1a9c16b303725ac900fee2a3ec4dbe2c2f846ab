xen/arm: disable cpuidle and cpufreq when linux is running as dom0

When linux is running as dom0, Xen doesn't show the physical cpu but a
virtual CPU.
On some ARM SOC (for instance the exynos 5250), linux registers callbacks
for cpuidle and cpufreq. When these callbacks are called, they will modify
directly the physical cpu not the virtual one. It can impact the whole board
instead of only dom0.
