ARM: constify machine_desc structure uses

struct machine_desc records are defined everywhere as a 'const'
structure, but unfortuantely it loses its const-ness through the use of
linker magic - the symbols which surround the section are not declared
const so it becomes possible not to use 'const' for pointers to these
const structures.

Let's fix this oversight - all pointers to these structures should be
marked const too.
