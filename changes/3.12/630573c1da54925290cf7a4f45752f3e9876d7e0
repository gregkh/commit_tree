powerpc: Fix denormalized exception handler

The denormalized exception handler (denorm_exception_hv) has a couple
of bugs.  If the CONFIG_PPC_DENORMALISATION option is not selected,
or the HSRR1_DENORM bit is not set in HSRR1, we don't test whether the
interrupt occurred within a KVM guest.  On the other hand, if the
HSRR1_DENORM bit is set and CONFIG_PPC_DENORMALISATION is enabled,
we corrupt the CFAR and PPR.

To correct these problems, this replaces the open-coded version of
EXCEPTION_PROLOG_1 that is there currently, and that is missing the
saving of PPR and CFAR values to the PACA, with an instance of
EXCEPTION_PROLOG_1.  This adds an explicit KVMTEST after testing
whether the exception is one we can handle, and adds code to restore
the CFAR on exit.
