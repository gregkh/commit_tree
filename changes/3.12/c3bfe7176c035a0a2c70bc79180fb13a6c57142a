NVMe: Namespace IDs are unsigned

The 'Number of Namespaces' read from the device was being treated as
signed, which would cause us to not scan any namespaces for a device
with more than 2 billion namespaces.  That led to noticing that the
namespace ID was also being treated as signed, which could lead to the
result from NVME_IOCTL_ID being treated as an error code.
