staging: vt6656: desc.h Move typedef struct tagSCTS* to new structures in rxtx.h

The new structures being
typedef struct tagSCTS -> struct vnt_cts
typedef struct tagSCTS_FB -> struct vnt_cts_fb

These are only needed by rxtc.c so moved to rxtx.h and
will eventually form part of the structure of
struct vnt_tx_buffer.

The linux/ieee80211.h in desc.h is no longer needed.
