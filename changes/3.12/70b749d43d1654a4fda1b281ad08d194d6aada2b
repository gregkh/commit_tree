staging/lustre/scrub: purge inconsistenct objects after OI scrub

When OI scrub repaired the found inconsistency, it needs to purge the
old object out of cache; otherwise, others may still use those cached
stale information.

Original patch adds functions in obdclass that is only used by server.
Drop that part. Only merge in error handling change.
