ceph: allow sync_read/write return partial successed size of read/write.

For sync_read/write, it may do multi stripe operations.If one of those
met erro, we return the former successed size rather than a error value.
There is a exception for write-operation met -EOLDSNAPC.If this occur,we
retry the whole write again.
