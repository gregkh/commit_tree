autofs4 - fix device ioctl mount lookup

When reconnecting to automounts at startup an autofs ioctl is used
to find the device and inode of existing mounts so they can be used
to open a file descriptor of possibly covered mounts.

At this time the the caller might not yet "own" the mount so it can
trigger calling ->d_automount(). This causes automount to hang when
trying to reconnect to direct or offset mount types.

Consequently kern_path() can't be used but kern_path_mountpoint() can be.
