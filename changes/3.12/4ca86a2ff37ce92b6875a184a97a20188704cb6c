MIPS: Netlogic: Add support for XLP2XX

XLP2XX is first in the series of 28nm XLPII processors.

The changes are to:
* Add processor ID for XLP2XX to asm/cpu.h and kernel/cpu-probe.c.
* Add a cpu_is_xlpii() function to check for XLPII processors.
* Update xlp_mmu_init() to use config4 to enable extended TLB.
