net: ipv6: minor: *_start_timer: rather use unsigned long

For the functions mld_gq_start_timer(), mld_ifc_start_timer(),
and mld_dad_start_timer(), rather use unsigned long than int
as we operate only on unsigned values anyway. This seems more
appropriate as there is no good reason to do type conversions
to int, that could lead to future errors.
