thermal: exynos: Add support to handle many instances of TMU

This patch adds support to handle multiple instances of the TMU controllers.
This is done by removing the static structure to register with the core thermal
and creating it dynamically for each instance of the TMU controller. The
interrupt is made shared type to handle shared interrupts. Now since the ISR needs
the core thermal framework to be registered so request_irq is moved after the core
registration is done.
Also the identifier of the TMU controller is extracted from device tree alias. This
will be used for TMU specific initialisation.
