libata: make ata_eh_qc_retry() bump scmd->allowed on bogus failures

libata EH decrements scmd->retries when the command failed for reasons
unrelated to the command itself so that, for example, commands aborted
due to suspend / resume cycle don't get penalized; however,
decrementing scmd->retries isn't enough for ATA passthrough commands.

Without this fix, ATA passthrough commands are not resend to the
drive, and no error is signalled to the caller because:

- allowed retry count is 1
- ata_eh_qc_complete fill the sense data, so result is valid
- sense data is filled with untouched ATA registers.
