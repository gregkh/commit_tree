dmaengine: make dma_submit_error() return an error code

The problem here is that the dma_xfer() functions in
drivers/ata/pata_arasan_cf.c and drivers/mtd/nand/fsmc_nand.c expect
dma_submit_error() to return an error code so they return 1 when they
intended to return a negative.

So far as I can tell, none of the ->tx_submit() functions ever do
return error codes so this patch should have no effect in the current
code.

I also changed it from a define to an inline.
