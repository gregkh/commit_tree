cpuidle: Check cpuidle_enable_device() return value

We previously changed the ordering of the cpuidle framework
initialization so that the governors are registered before the
drivers which can register their devices right from the start.

Now, we can safely remove the __cpuidle_register_device() call hack
in cpuidle_enable_device() and check if the driver has been
registered before enabling it.  Then, cpuidle_register_device() can
consistently check the cpuidle_enable_device() return value when
enabling the device.
