KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Make instruction fetch fallback work for system calls

It turns out that if we exit the guest due to a hcall instruction (sc 1),
and the loading of the instruction in the guest exit path fails for any
reason, the call to kvmppc_ld() in kvmppc_get_last_inst() fetches the
instruction after the hcall instruction rather than the hcall itself.
This in turn means that the instruction doesn't get recognized as an
hcall in kvmppc_handle_exit_pr() but gets passed to the guest kernel
as a sc instruction.  That usually results in the guest kernel getting
a return code of 38 (ENOSYS) from an hcall, which often triggers a
BUG_ON() or other failure.

This fixes the problem by adding a new variant of kvmppc_get_last_inst()
called kvmppc_get_last_sc(), which fetches the instruction if necessary
from pc - 4 rather than pc.
