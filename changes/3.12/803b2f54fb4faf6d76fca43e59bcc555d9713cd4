Btrfs: fill UUID tree initially

When the UUID tree is initially created, a task is spawned that
walks through the root tree. For each found subvolume root_item,
the uuid and received_uuid entries in the UUID tree are added.
This is such a quick operation so that in case somebody wants
to unmount the filesystem while the task is still running, the
unmount is delayed until the UUID tree building task is finished.
