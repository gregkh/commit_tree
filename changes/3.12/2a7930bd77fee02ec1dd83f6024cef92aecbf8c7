Documentation/printk-formats.txt: No casts needed for u64/s64

Now all 64-bit architectures have been converted to int-ll64.h in kernel
space, casting to (unsigned) long long is no longer needed when formatting
u64/s64.

For backwards compatibility, alpha, ia64, mips64, and powerpc64 still use
int-l64.h in userspace.
