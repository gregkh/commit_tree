Revert "iio: add configuration option for debug support"

This reverts commit 98a5e9e99d05e9b6a14778b85631b55e8e349990.

IIO, like the rest of the kernel, should rely on dynamic debugging, not
have a special config option for it.  That way, no user has to rebuild
their kernel to have debug messages, which is a good thing, let's not
revert back to the bad old days of the 2000's.
