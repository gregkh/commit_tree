openvswitch: Mega flow implementation

Add wildcarded flow support in kernel datapath.

Wildcarded flow can improve OVS flow set up performance by avoid sending
matching new flows to the user space program. The exact performance boost
will largely dependent on wildcarded flow hit rate.

In case all new flows hits wildcard flows, the flow set up rate is
within 5% of that of linux bridge module.

Pravin has made significant contributions to this patch. Including API
clean ups and bug fixes.
