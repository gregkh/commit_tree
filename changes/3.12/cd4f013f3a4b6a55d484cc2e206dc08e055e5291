drm/gem: switch dev->object_name_lock to a mutex

I want to wrap the creation of a dma-buf from a gem object in it,
so that the obj->export_dma_buf cache can be atomically filled in.

Instead of creating a new mutex just for that variable I've figured
I can reuse the existing dev->object_name_lock, especially since
the new semantics will exactly mirror the flink obj->name already
protected by that lock.

v2: idr_preload/idr_preload_end is now an atomic section, so need to
move the mutex locking outside.
