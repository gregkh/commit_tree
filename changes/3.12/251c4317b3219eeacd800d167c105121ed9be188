staging/lustre/llite: call simple_setattr() from ll_md_setattr()

This partially reverts the change from "LU-2482 layout: introduce new
layout for released files" by calling simple_setattr() from
ll_md_setattr() without ATTR_SIZE set. Doing so avoids failed
assertions in osc_page_delete(). Disable truncates on released files
and modify sanity 229 accordingly.
