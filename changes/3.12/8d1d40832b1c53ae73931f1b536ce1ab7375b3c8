xfs: Simplify xfs_ail_min() with list_first_entry_or_null()

At xfs_ail_min(), we do check if the AIL list is empty or not before
returning the first item in it with list_empty() and list_first_entry().

This can be simplified a bit with a new list operation routine that is
the list_first_entry_or_null() which has been introduced by:

commit 6d7581e62f8be462440d7b22c6361f7c9fa4902b
    list: introduce list_first_entry_or_null

v2: make xfs_ail_min() as a static inline function and move it to
    xfs_trans_priv.h as per Dave Chinner's comments.
