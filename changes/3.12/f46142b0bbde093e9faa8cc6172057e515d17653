staging: vt6656: rxtx.c s_vGenerateTxParameter create argument bool need rts

Allow conditional statements to be based on true/false instead of
NULL or not pointer pvRTS.

Harmonise all call functions will bool type.

If need_rts is true then rts is needed.

If need_rts is false then
	cts is needed only when byPktType == PK_TYPE_11GB || PK_TYPE_11GA.
	none no rts/cts other byPktTypes.

This allow the joining of pointers pvRTS/pvCTS in to single pointer.
