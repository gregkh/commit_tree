openvswitch: Fix alignment of struct sw_flow_key.

sw_flow_key alignment was declared as " __aligned(__alignof__(long))".
However, this breaks on the m68k architecture where long is 32 bit in
size but 16 bit aligned by default. This aligns to the size of a long to
ensure that we can always do comparsions in full long-sized chunks. It
also adds an additional build check to catch any reduction in alignment.
