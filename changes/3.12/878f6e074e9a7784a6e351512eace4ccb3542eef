Revert "cpufreq: Use cpufreq_policy_list for iterating over policies"

Revert commit eb60852 (cpufreq: Use cpufreq_policy_list for iterating
over policies), because it breaks system suspend/resume on multiple
machines.

It either causes resume to block indefinitely or causes the BUG_ON()
in lock_policy_rwsem_##mode() to trigger on sysfs accesses to cpufreq
attributes.
