i2c: move ACPI helpers into the core

This follows what has already been done for the DeviceTree helpers. Move
the ACPI helpers from drivers/acpi/acpi_i2c.c to the I2C core and update
documentation accordingly.

This also solves a problem reported by Jerry Snitselaar that we can't build
the ACPI I2C helpers as a module.
