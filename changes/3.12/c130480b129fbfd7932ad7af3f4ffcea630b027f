target: Fix se_cmd->state_list leak regression during WRITE failure

This patch addresses a v3.11 specific regression where se_cmd->state_list
was being leaked during a fabric WRITE failure, when the fabric releases
an associated se_cmd descriptor before I/O submission occurs, and normal
fast path callbacks have a chance to call target_remove_from_state_list().

It was manifesting with Poison overwritten messages with iscsi-target
once an ImmediateData payload CRC32C failure occured.

This bug was originally introduced during v3.11-rc1 with the following
commit:
