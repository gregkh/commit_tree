ARM: 7837/3: fix Thumb-2 bug in AES assembler code

Patch 638591c enabled building the AES assembler code in Thumb2 mode.
However, this code used arithmetic involving PC rather than adr{l}
instructions to generate PC-relative references to the lookup tables,
and this needs to take into account the different PC offset when
running in Thumb mode.
