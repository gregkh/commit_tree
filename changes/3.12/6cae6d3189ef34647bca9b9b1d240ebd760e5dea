ocfs2: fix possible double free in ocfs2_reflink_xattr_rec

In ocfs2_reflink_xattr_rec(), meta_ac and data_ac are allocated by calling
ocfs2_lock_reflink_xattr_rec_allocators().

Once an error occurs when allocating *data_ac, it frees *meta_ac which is
allocated before.  Here it mistakenly sets meta_ac to NULL but *meta_ac.
Then ocfs2_reflink_xattr_rec() will try to free meta_ac again which is
already invalid.
