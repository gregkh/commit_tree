powerpc/perf: Add e6500 PMU driver

e6500 core performance monitors has the following features:
- 6 performance monitor counters
- 512 events supported
- no threshold events

e6500 PMU has more specific events (Data L1 cache misses, Instruction L1
cache misses, etc ) than e500 PMU (which only had Data L1 cache reloads,
etc). Where available, the more specific events have been used which will
produce slightly different results than e500 PMU equivalents.
