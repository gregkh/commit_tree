ath9k: fix rx descriptor related race condition

Similar to a race condition that exists in the tx path, the hardware
might re-read the 'next' pointer of a descriptor of the last completed
frame. This only affects non-EDMA (pre-AR93xx) devices.

To deal with this race, defer clearing and re-linking a completed rx
descriptor until the next one has been processed.
