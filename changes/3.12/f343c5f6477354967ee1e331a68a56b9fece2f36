drm/i915: Getter/setter for object attributes

Soon we want to gut a lot of our existing assumptions how many address
spaces an object can live in, and in doing so, embed the drm_mm_node in
the object (and later the VMA).

It's possible in the future we'll want to add more getter/setter
methods, but for now this is enough to enable the VMAs.

v2: Reworked commit message (Ben)
Added comments to the main functions (Ben)
