pkt_sched: fq: fix non TCP flows pacing

Steinar reported FQ pacing was not working for UDP flows.

It looks like the initial sk->sk_pacing_rate value of 0 was
a wrong choice. We should init it to ~0U (unlimited)

Then, TCA_FQ_FLOW_DEFAULT_RATE should be removed because it makes
no real sense. The default rate is really unlimited, and we
need to avoid a zero divide.
