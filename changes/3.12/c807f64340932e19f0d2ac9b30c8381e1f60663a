ib_srpt: always set response for task management

The SRP specification requires:

  "Response data shall be provided in any SRP_RSP response that is sent in
   response to an SRP_TSK_MGMT request (see 6.7). The information in the
   RSP_CODE field (see table 24) shall indicate the completion status of
   the task management function."

So fix this to avoid the SRP initiator interprets task management functions
that succeeded as failed.
