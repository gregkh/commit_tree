The L2 cache controller(PL310) version on the i.MX6D/Q is r3p1-50rel0
The L2 cache controller(PL310) version on the i.MX6DL/SOLO/SL is r3p2
But according to ARM PL310 errata: 752271
ID: 752271: Double linefill feature can cause data corruption
Fault Status: Present in: r3p0, r3p1, r3p1-50rel0. Fixed in r3p2
Workaround: The only workaround to this erratum is to disable the
double linefill feature. This is the default behavior.
