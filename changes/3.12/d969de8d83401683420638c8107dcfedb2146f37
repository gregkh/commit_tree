serial: vt8500: add missing braces

Due to missing braces on an if statement, in presence of a device_node a
port was always assigned -1, regardless of any alias entries in the
device tree. Conversely, if device_node was NULL, an unitialized port
ended up being used.

This patch adds the missing braces, fixing the issues.
