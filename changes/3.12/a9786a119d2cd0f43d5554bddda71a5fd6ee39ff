drm/i915: Pull watermark level validity check out

Refactor the code a bit to split the watermark level validity check into
a separate function.

Also add hack there that allows us to use it even for LP0 watermarks.
ATM we don't pre-compute/check the LP0 watermarks, so we just have to
clamp them to the maximum and hope things work out.

v2: Add some debug prints when we exceed max WM0
    Kill pointless ret = false' assignment.
    Include the check for the already disabled 'result' which
    got shuffled around when the patchs got reorderd
