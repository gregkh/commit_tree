spi: bcm2835: Add spi_master_get() call to prevent use after free

The call to spi_unregister_master results in device memory being freed, it must
no longer be accessed afterwards. Thus call spi_master_get() to get an extra
reference to the device and call spi_master_put() only after the last access to
device data.

Note, current code has an extra spi_master_put() call in bcm2835_spi_remove().
Thus this patch just adds an spi_master_get() to balance the reference count.
