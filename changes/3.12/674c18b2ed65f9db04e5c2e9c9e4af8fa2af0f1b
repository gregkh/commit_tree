ixgbe: clear semaphore bits on timeouts

This patch changes the error code path in ixgbe_acquire_swfw_sync() to deal
with cases where acquiring SW semaphore times out.

In cases where the SW/FW semaphore bits were set (i.e. due to a crash) the
driver will hang on load. With this patch the driver will clear
the stuck bits if the semaphore was not acquired in the allotted time.
