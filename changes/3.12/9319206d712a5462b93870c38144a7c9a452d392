ARM: 7835/2: fix modular build of xor_blocks() with NEON enabled

Commit 0195659 introduced a NEON accelerated version of the xor_blocks()
function, but it needs the changes in this patch to allow it to be built
as a module rather than statically into the kernel.

This patch creates a separate module xor-neon.ko which exports the NEON
inner xor_blocks() functions depended upon by the regular xor.ko if it
is built with CONFIG_KERNEL_MODE_NEON=y
