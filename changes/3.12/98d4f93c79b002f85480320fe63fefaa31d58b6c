Staging: olpc_dcon: replace some magic numbers

This patch replace some magic numbers. I believe it makes
the driver more readable.

The magic number 0x26 is the XO system embedded controller
(EC) command 'DCON power enable/disable'.

Number 0x41, and 0x42 are special memory controller settings
register.  The 0x41 initialize bit sequence 0x101 means:
enable memory power down function and special SDRAM clock
delay for synchronize SDRAM output and clock signal.

The 0x42 initialize squence 0x101 is wrong.  According to
the specification Bit 8 is reserved, thus not in use.
I removed it.
