ALSA: hda - Fix invalid multi-io creation on VAIO-Z laptops

VAIO-Z laptops need to use the specific DAC for the speaker output
by some unknown reason although the codec itself supports the flexible
connection.  So we implemented a workaround by a new flag,
no_primary_hp, for assigning the speaker pin first.

This worked until 3.8 kernel, but it got broken because the driver
learned for a better multi-io pin mapping, and not it can assign two
mic pins for multi-io.  Since the multi-io requires to be the primary
output, the hp and two mic pins are assigned in prior to the speaker
in the end.

Although the machine has two mic pins, one of them is used as a noise-
canceling headphone, thus it's no real retaskable mic jack.  Thus, at
best, we can disable the multi-io assignment and make the parser
behavior back to the state before the multi-io.

This patch adds again a new flag, no_multi_io, to indicate that the
device has no multi-io capability, and set it in the fixup for
VAIO-Z.  The no_multi_io flag itself can be used generically, added
via a helper line, too.
