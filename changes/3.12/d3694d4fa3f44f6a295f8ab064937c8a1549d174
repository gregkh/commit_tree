PCI: Allow PCIe Capability link-related register access for switches

Every PCIe device has a link, except Root Complex Integrated Endpoints
and Root Complex Event Collectors.  Previously we didn't give access
to PCIe capability link-related registers for Upstream Ports, Downstream
Ports, and Bridges, so attempts to read PCI_EXP_LNKCTL incorrectly
returned zero.  See PCIe spec r3.0, sec 7.8 and 1.3.2.3.
