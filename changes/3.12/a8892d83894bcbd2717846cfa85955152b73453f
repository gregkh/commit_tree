thermal: thermal_core: allow binding with limits on bind_params

When registering a thermal zone device using platform information
via bind_params, the thermal framework will always perform the
cdev binding using the lowest and highest limits (THERMAL_NO_LIMIT).

This patch changes the data structures so that it is possible
to inform what are the desired limits for each trip point
inside a bind_param. The way the binding is performed is also
changed so that it uses the new data structure.
