staging: comedi: usbdux: fix usbdux_pwm_start()

Add the missing down/up of the semaphore to prevent other commands
from being issued to the usb device while the pwn is being stopped.

Rename the local variable used for the private data pointer to the
comedi "norm".

Use memset() to initialize the urb transfer buffer.
