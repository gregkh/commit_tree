mtd: r852: add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions

Add CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to suspend/resume functions to fix the following
build warning when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not selected. This is because
sleep PM callbacks defined by SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS are only used when
the CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled. Also, unnecessary NULL defines are
removed.

drivers/mtd/nand/r852.c:1006:12: warning: 'r852_suspend' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/mtd/nand/r852.c:1027:12: warning: 'r852_resume' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
