HID: wiimote: work around broken DRM_KAI on GEN10

GEN10 and earlier devices seem to not support DRM_KAI if we run in basic
IR mode. Use DRM_KAIE instead. This might increases overhead slightly as
the extension port is read and streamed but we stream accelerometer data
constantly, too, so this is negligible.

Note that our parsers are hardcoded on IR-formats, so we cannot actually
use 96-bit IR DRMs for basic IR data. We would have to adjust the parsers.
But as only GEN20 and newer support this, we simply avoid mixed DRMs.

This fixes a bug where GEN10 devices didn't provide IR data if
accelerometer and IR are enabled simultaneously. As a workaround, you can
enable DRM_KAIE without this patch via (disables device power-management):
  echo "37" >/sys/kernel/debug/hid/<dev>/drm
