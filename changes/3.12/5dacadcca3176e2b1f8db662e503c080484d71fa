staging: comedi: drivers: use comedi_dio_insn_config() for complex cases

Convert the drivers with complex, port programmable i/o, to use the
comedi_dio_insn_config() helper function.

All of these drivers have some sort of 'port' programmable i/o where multiple
i/o channels are configured as a group. The 'mask' associated with the group
is passed to comedi_dio_insn_config() so that all the channels are configured.
