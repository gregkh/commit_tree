mm: track vma changes with VM_SOFTDIRTY bit

Pavel reported that in case if vma area get unmapped and then mapped (or
expanded) in-place, the soft dirty tracker won't be able to recognize this
situation since it works on pte level and ptes are get zapped on unmap,
loosing soft dirty bit of course.

So to resolve this situation we need to track actions on vma level, there
VM_SOFTDIRTY flag comes in.  When new vma area created (or old expanded)
we set this bit, and keep it here until application calls for clearing
soft dirty bit.

Thus when user space application track memory changes now it can detect if
vma area is renewed.
