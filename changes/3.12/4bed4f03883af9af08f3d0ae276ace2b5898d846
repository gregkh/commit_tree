staging: comedi: Kconfig: COMEDI_NI_ATMIO doesn't need to depend on ISAPNP

The COMEDI_NI_ATMIO configuration option causes the "ni_atmio" module to
be built, which handles various National Instruments ISA-PNP data
acquisition cards.  The configuration option currently depends on
ISAPNP.

The "ni_atmio" module is a "legacy" comedi driver with no
auto-configuration support and it doesn't register as a PNP card driver.
The only difference in initialization from the other comedi ISA card
drivers is that it will use the ISA-PNP functions to find, attach and
activate the card if no I/O base address has been specified by the user
in the COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl.

The module compiles fine without the ISAPNP configuration option as the
<linux/isapnp.h> and <linux/pnp.h> headers provide dummy inline
functions if the ISAPNP and PNP options, respectively, are not enabled.

Remove the dependancy on the ISAPNP option since the module builds
without it and can be used without it.

(There is a very slim chance that comedi will support proper ISA PNP
drivers one day, in which case the ni_atmio driver could be converted to
use this support and not support manual configuration.  However, not all
the PnP IDs of boards supported by this driver are currently known to
us.)
