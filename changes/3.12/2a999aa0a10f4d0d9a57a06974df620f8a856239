Kconfig: make KOBJECT_RELEASE debugging require timer debugging

Without the timer debugging, the delayed kobject release will just
result in undebuggable oopses if it triggers any latent bugs.  That
doesn't actually help debugging at all.

So make DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE depend on DEBUG_OBJECTS_TIMERS to avoid
having people enable one without the other.
