Bluetooth: hidp: remove wrong send_report at init

The USB hid implementation does retrieve the reports during the start.
However, this implementation does not call the HID command GET_REPORT
(which would fetch the current status of each report), but use the
DATA command, which is an Output Report (so transmitting data from the
host to the device).
The Wiimote controller is already guarded against this problem in the
protocol, but it is not conformant to the specification to set all the
reports to 0 on start.
