perf: Export struct perf_branch_entry to userspace

If PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK is enabled then samples are returned
with the format { u64 from, to, flags } but the flags layout
is not specified.

This field has the type struct perf_branch_entry; move this
definition into include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h so users can
access these fields.

This is similar to the existing inclusion of perf_mem_data_src in
the include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h file.
