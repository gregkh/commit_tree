net: attempt high order allocations in sock_alloc_send_pskb()

Adding paged frags skbs to af_unix sockets introduced a performance
regression on large sends because of additional page allocations, even
if each skb could carry at least 100% more payload than before.

We can instruct sock_alloc_send_pskb() to attempt high order
allocations.

Most of the time, it does a single page allocation instead of 8.

I added an additional parameter to sock_alloc_send_pskb() to
let other users to opt-in for this new feature on followup patches.

Tested:

Before patch :

$ netperf -t STREAM_STREAM
STREAM STREAM TEST
Recv   Send    Send
Socket Socket  Message  Elapsed
Size   Size    Size     Time     Throughput
bytes  bytes   bytes    secs.    10^6bits/sec

 2304  212992  212992    10.00    46861.15

After patch :

$ netperf -t STREAM_STREAM
STREAM STREAM TEST
Recv   Send    Send
Socket Socket  Message  Elapsed
Size   Size    Size     Time     Throughput
bytes  bytes   bytes    secs.    10^6bits/sec
