ALSA: hda - Try to allow haswell HDMI audio even without powerwell

If compiled without CONFIG_SND_HDA_I915, the audio driver cannot
request power well. However, if the power well is on for other
reasons, maybe audio can still work. Therefore, do not skip the
card completely if compiled without CONFIG_SND_HDA_I915.
