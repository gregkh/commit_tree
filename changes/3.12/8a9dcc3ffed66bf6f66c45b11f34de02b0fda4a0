pinctrl: shut up a couple of pinctrl warnings

So, I notice that we get a couple of warnings from the pinctrl code:

drivers/pinctrl/pinconf.c: In function 'pinconf_dbg_config_print':
drivers/pinctrl/pinconf.c:433:36: warning: 'configs' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/pinctrl/pinconf.c: In function 'pinconf_dbg_config_write':
drivers/pinctrl/pinconf.c:511:36: warning: 'configs' may be used uninitialized in this function

While the compiler might not be able to work out that "configs" is
safe, the code doesn't lend itself very well to identifying that
fact when reading it either.  This can be trivially solved by a slight
restructuring of the code - which also reduces the LOC.
