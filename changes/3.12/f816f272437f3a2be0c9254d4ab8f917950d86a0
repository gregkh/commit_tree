drm/msm: return -EBUSY if bo still active

When we CPU_PREP a bo with NOSYNC flag (for example, to implement
PIPE_TRANSFER_DISCARD_WHOLE_RESOURCE), an -EBUSY return indicates to
userspace that the bo is still busy.  Previously it was incorrectly
returning 0 in this case.

And while we're in there throw in an bit of extra sanity checking in
case userspace tries to wait for a bogus fence.
