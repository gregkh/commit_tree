ipv6 mcast: use in6_dev_put in timer handlers instead of __in6_dev_put

It is possible for the timer handlers to run after the call to
ipv6_mc_down so use in6_dev_put instead of __in6_dev_put in the
handler function in order to do proper cleanup when the refcnt
reaches 0. Otherwise, the refcnt can reach zero without the
inet6_dev being destroyed and we end up leaking a reference to
the net_device and see messages like the following,

unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1

Tested on linux-3.4.43.
