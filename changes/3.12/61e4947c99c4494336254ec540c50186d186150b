md: Fix skipping recovery for read-only arrays.

Since:
        commit 7ceb17e87bde79d285a8b988cfed9eaeebe60b86
        md: Allow devices to be re-added to a read-only array.

spares are activated on a read-only array. In case of raid1 and raid10
personalities it causes that not-in-sync devices are marked in-sync
without checking if recovery has been finished.

If a read-only array is degraded and one of its devices is not in-sync
(because the array has been only partially recovered) recovery will be skipped.

This patch adds checking if recovery has been finished before marking a device
in-sync for raid1 and raid10 personalities. In case of raid5 personality
such condition is already present (at raid5.c:6029).

Bug was introduced in 3.10 and causes data corruption.
