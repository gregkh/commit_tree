staging/lustre: Make quota namespace refcounting consistent

It seems quota namespace is needlessly referenced on connect,
but that's not necessary as it could not go away until entire
obd goes away.
On the other hand this extra reference disturbs other logic
depending on empty namespace having zero refcount, so this patch
drops such extra referencing.

This picks client side change of the original patch.
