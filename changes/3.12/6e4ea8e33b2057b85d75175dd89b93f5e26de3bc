ext4: fix memory leak in xattr

If we take the 2nd retry path in ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea, we
potentionally return from the function without having freed these
allocations.  If we don't do the return, we over-write the previous
allocation pointers, so we leak either way.

Spotted with Coverity.

[ Fixed by tytso to set is and bs to NULL after freeing these
  pointers, in case in the retry loop we later end up triggering an
  error causing a jump to cleanup, at which point we could have a double
  free bug. -- Ted ]
