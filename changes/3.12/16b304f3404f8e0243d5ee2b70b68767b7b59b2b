netlink: Eliminate kmalloc in netlink dump operation.

Following patch stores struct netlink_callback in netlink_sock
to avoid allocating and freeing it on every netlink dump msg.
Only one dump operation is allowed for a given socket at a time
therefore we can safely convert cb pointer to cb struct inside
netlink_sock.
