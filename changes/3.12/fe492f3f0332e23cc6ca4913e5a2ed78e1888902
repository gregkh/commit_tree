cpufreq: Fix broken usage of governor->owner's refcount

The cpufreq governor owner refcount usage is broken.  We should only
increment that refcount when a CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_INIT event has come
and it should only be decremented if CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_EXIT has come.

Currently, there can be situations where the governor is in use, but
we have allowed it to be unloaded which may result in undefined
behavior.  Let's fix it.
