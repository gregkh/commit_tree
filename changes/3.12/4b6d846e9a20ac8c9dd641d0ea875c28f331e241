drm/i915: Drop the overzealous warning from i915_gem_set_cache_level

By our earlier reckoning, move from a snooped/llc setting to an uncached
setting, leaves the CPU cache in a consistent state irrespective of our
domain tracking - so we can forgo the warning about the lack of
invalidation. Similarly for any writes posted to the snooped CPU domain,
we know will be safely clflushed to the uncached PTEs after forcing the
domain change.

This WARN started to pop up with

    drm/i915: Allow the GPU to cache stolen memory

Ville brought up a scenario where the interaction of a set_caching
ioctl call from userspace on a scanout buffer (i.e. obj->pin_display
is set) resulted in the code getting confused and not properly
flushing stale cpu cachelines. Luckily we already prevent this by
rejecting caching changes when obj->pin_count is set.
