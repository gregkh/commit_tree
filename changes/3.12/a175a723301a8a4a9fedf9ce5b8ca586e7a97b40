openvswitch: Add SCTP support

This patch adds support for rewriting SCTP src,dst ports similar to the
functionality already available for TCP/UDP.

Rewriting SCTP ports is expensive due to double-recalculation of the
SCTP checksums; this is performed to ensure that packets traversing OVS
with invalid checksums will continue to the destination with any
checksum corruption intact.
