ARM: imx: Re-select CONFIG_SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783 option

Commit 02502da45 (ASoC: imx-mc13783: Depend on ARCH_ARM) caused the selection of
CONFIG_SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783 to be impossible due to a wrong dependency, which
caused CONFIG_SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783 to be removed after the defconfigs cleanups.

The original selection problem has been fixed by 9f19de649f (ASoC: imx-mc13783:
Make SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783 visible again), so it is possible to select
CONFIG_SND_SOC_IMX_MC13783 again as originally done.
