xfs: inode log reservations are too small

We've been seeing occasional problems with log space leaks and
transaction underruns such as this for some time:

 XFS (dm-0): xlog_write: reservation summary:
   trans type  = FSYNC_TS (36)
   unit res    = 2740 bytes
   current res = -4 bytes
   total reg   = 0 bytes (o/flow = 0 bytes)
   ophdrs      = 0 (ophdr space = 0 bytes)
   ophdr + reg = 0 bytes
   num regions = 0

Turns out that xfstests generic/311 is reliably reproducing this
problem with the test it runs at sequence 16 of it execution. It is
a 100% reliable reproducer with the mkfs configuration of "-b
size=1024 -m crc=1" on a 10GB scratch device.

The problem? Inode forks in btree format are logged in memory
format, not disk format (i.e. bmbt format, not bmdr format). That
means there is a btree block header being logged, when such a
structure is never written to the inode fork in bmdr format. The
bmdr header in the inode is only 4 bytes, while the bmbt header is
24 bytes for v4 filesystems and 72 bytes for v5 filesystems.

We currently reserve the inode size plus the rounded up overhead of
a logging a buffer, which is 128 bytes. That means the reservation
for a 512 byte inode is 640 bytes. What we can actually log is:

	inode core, data and attr fork = 512 bytes
	inode log format + log op header = 56 + 12 = 68 bytes
	data fork bmbt hdr = 24/72 bytes
	attr fork bmbt hdr = 24/72 bytes

So, for a v2 inodes we can log at least 628 bytes, but if we split that
inode over the end of the log across log buffers, we need to also
another log op header, which takes us to 640 bytes. If there's
another reservation taken out of this that I haven't taken into
account (perhaps multiple iclog splits?) or I haven't corectly
calculated the bmbt format space used (entirely possible), then
we will overun it.

For v3 inodes the maximum is actually 724 bytes, and even a
single maximally sized btree format fork can blow it (652 bytes).
And that's exactly what is happening with the FSYNC_TS transaction
in the above output - it's consumed 644 bytes of space after the CIL
context took the space reserved for it (2100 bytes).

This problem has always been present in the XFS code - the btree
format inode forks have always been logged in this manner. Hence
there has always been the possibility of an overrun with such a
transaction. The CRC code has just exposed it frequently enough to
be able to debug and understand the root cause....

So, let's fix all the inode log space reservations.

[ I'm so glad we spent the effort to clean up the transaction
  reservation code. This is an easy fix now. ]
