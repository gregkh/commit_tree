cgroup: change cgroup_from_id() to css_from_id()

Now we want cgroup core to always provide the css to use to the
subsystems, so change this API to css_from_id().

Uninline css_from_id(), because it's getting bigger and cgroup_css()
has been unexported.

While at it, remove the #ifdef, and shuffle the order of the args.
