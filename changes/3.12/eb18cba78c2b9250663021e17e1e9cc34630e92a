math64: New separate div64_u64_rem helper

Commit f792685006274a850e6cc0ea9ade275ccdfc90bc ("math64: New
div64_u64_rem helper") implemented div64_u64 in terms of div64_u64_rem.
But div64_u64_rem was removed because it slowed down div64_u64 (and
there were no other users of div64_u64_rem).

Device Mapper's I/O statistics support has a need for div64_u64_rem;
reintroduce this helper as a separate method that doesn't slow down
div64_u64, especially on 32-bit systems.
