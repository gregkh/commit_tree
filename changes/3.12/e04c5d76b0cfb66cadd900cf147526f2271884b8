remove sched notifier for cross-cpu migrations

Linux as a guest on KVM hypervisor, the only user of the pvclock
vsyscall interface, does not require notification on task migration
because:

1. cpu ID number maps 1:1 to per-CPU pvclock time info.
2. per-CPU pvclock time info is updated if the
   underlying CPU changes.
3. that version is increased whenever underlying CPU
   changes.

Which is sufficient to guarantee nanoseconds counter
is calculated properly.
