[media] s5p-jpeg: Initialize vfd_decoder->vfl_dir field

This patch fixes regression introduced in commit 5c77879ff9ab9e7
"[media] v4l2-dev: add new VFL_DIR_ defines" caused by not initializing
the vfl_dir field of the vfd_decoder instance of struct video_device,
after the field was introduced. It precluded calling the driver's ioctls
which require vfl_dir not to be equal to VFL_DIR_RX which is defined as
0 and uninitialized vfl_dir field is interpreted as such. In effect the
test in the v4l_s_fmt function failed for the ioctls that expect is_tx
to be false, which prevented the ioctl callbacks registered by the driver
from being called.
