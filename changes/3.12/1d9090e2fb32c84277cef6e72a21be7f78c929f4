x86, asmlinkage: Make all interrupt handlers asmlinkage / __visible

These handlers are all referenced from assembler stubs, so need
to be visible.

The handlers without arguments become asmlinkage, the others __visible
to not force regparms(0) on x86-32.

I put it all into a single patch, please let me know if you want
it it split up.
