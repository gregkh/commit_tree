rcu: Update RTFP documentation

Note that this commit also updates the formatting of serveral of the
bibtex entries to conform to that of my .bib files.  I started
accumulating entries back in the 1980s, back when bibtex insisted
that comma (",") was a separator, not a terminator.  This rule forced
commas to the fronts of lines.  25 years later, bibtex allows commas
to be terminators, but I am too lazy to rework all my .bib files.
Keeping the same format as my .bib files allows my to simply
incorporate my RCU.bib file into Documentation/RCU/RTFP.txt, which
is much easier than my earlier practice of keeping track of what
had changed and adding individual entries.  (I sometimes find relevant
papers that were published some years back, for example.)

In addition, this change adds entries for papers published in the
last year or so.
