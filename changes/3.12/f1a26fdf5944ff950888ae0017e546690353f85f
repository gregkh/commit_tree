pch_gbe: Add MinnowBoard support

The MinnowBoard uses an AR803x PHY with the PCH GBE which requires
special handling. Use the MinnowBoard PCI Subsystem ID to detect this
and add a pci_device_id.driver_data structure and functions to handle
platform setup.

The AR803x does not implement the RGMII 2ns TX clock delay in the trace
routing nor via strapping. Add a detection method for the board and the
PHY and enable the TX clock delay via the registers.

This PHY will hibernate without link for 10 seconds. Ensure the PHY is
awake for probe and then disable hibernation. A future improvement would
be to convert pch_gbe to using PHYLIB and making sure we can wake the
PHY at the necessary times rather than permanently disabling it.
