FMC: fix locking in sample chardev driver

The fmc-chardev module was over-locking, by calling misc
register/unregister while holding its spinlock.  This reported a
"scheduling while atomic" error.

Since the misc driver already serializes operations internally, this
commit downgrades the fmc-chardev lock to just cover its own list.
