of: move of_get_cpu_node implementation to DT core library

This patch moves the generalized implementation of of_get_cpu_node from
PowerPC to DT core library, thereby adding support for retrieving cpu
node for a given logical cpu index on any architecture.

The CPU subsystem can now use this function to assign of_node in the
cpu device while registering CPUs.

It is recommended to use these helper function only in pre-SMP/early
initialisation stages to retrieve CPU device node pointers in logical
ordering. Once the cpu devices are registered, it can be retrieved easily
from cpu device of_node which avoids unnecessary parsing and matching.
