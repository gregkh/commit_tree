RAID: add tilegx SIMD implementation of raid6

This change adds TILE-Gx SIMD instructions to the software raid
(md), modeling the Altivec implementation. This is only for Syndrome
generation; there is more that could be done to improve recovery,
as in the recent Intel SSE3 recovery implementation.

The code unrolls 8 times; this turns out to be the best on tilegx
hardware among the set 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.  The code reads one
cache-line of data from each disk, stores P and Q then goes to the
next cache-line.

The test code in sys/linux/lib/raid6/test reports 2008 MB/s data
read rate for syndrome generation using 18 disks (16 data and 2
parity). It was 1512 MB/s before this SIMD optimizations. This is
running on 1 core with all the data in cache.

This is based on the paper The Mathematics of RAID-6.
