mm/backing-dev.c: check user buffer length before copying data to the related user buffer

'*lenp' may be less than "sizeof(kbuf)" so we must check this before the
next copy_to_user().

pdflush_proc_obsolete() is called by sysctl which 'procname' is
"nr_pdflush_threads", if the user passes buffer length less than
"sizeof(kbuf)", it will cause issue.
