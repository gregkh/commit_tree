pkt_sched: fq: prefetch() fix

kbuild bot reported following m68k build error :

  net/sched/sch_fq.c: In function 'fq_dequeue':
>> net/sched/sch_fq.c:491:2: error: implicit declaration of function
'prefetch' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
   cc1: some warnings being treated as errors

While we are fixing this, move this prefetch() call a bit earlier.
