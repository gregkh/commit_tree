mtd: add a new ecc_step_size field to mtd_info{}

In order to implement the NAND boot for some Freescale's chips, such as
imx23/imx28/imx50/imx6, we use a tool (called kobs-ng) to burn the uboot
and some metadata to nand chip. And the ROM code will use the metadata to
configrate the BCH, and to find the uboot.

The ECC information(ecc step size, ecc strength) which is used to configrure
the BCH is part of the metadata. The kobs-ng can get the ecc strength from
the sys node /sys/*/ecc_strength now. But it can not get the ecc step size.

This patch adds a new field to store the ecc step size in mtd_info{}, and
it makes preparation for the next patches.
