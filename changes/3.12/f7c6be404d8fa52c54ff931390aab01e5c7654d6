vhost_net: correctly limit the max pending buffers

As Michael point out, We used to limit the max pending DMAs to get better cache
utilization. But it was not done correctly since it was one done when there's no
new buffers submitted from guest. Guest can easily exceeds the limitation by
keeping sending packets.

So this patch moves the check into main loop. Tests shows about 5%-10%
improvement on per cpu throughput for guest tx.
