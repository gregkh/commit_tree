KVM: mmu: allow page tables to be in read-only slots

Page tables in a read-only memory slot will currently cause a triple
fault because the page walker uses gfn_to_hva and it fails on such a slot.

OVMF uses such a page table; however, real hardware seems to be fine with
that as long as the accessed/dirty bits are set.  Save whether the slot
is readonly, and later check it when updating the accessed and dirty bits.
