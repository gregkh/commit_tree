net: tcp_probe: adapt tbuf size for recent changes

With recent changes in tcp_probe module (e.g. f925d0a62d ("net: tcp_probe:
add IPv6 support")) we also need to take into account that tbuf needs to
be updated as format string will be further expanded. tbuf sits on the stack
in tcpprobe_read() function that is invoked when user space reads procfs
file /proc/net/tcpprobe, hence not fast path as in jtcp_rcv_established().
Having a size similarly as in sctp_probe module of 256 bytes is fully
sufficient for that, we need theoretical maximum of 252 bytes otherwise we
could get truncated.
