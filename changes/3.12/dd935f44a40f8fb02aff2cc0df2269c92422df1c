libceph: add function to ensure notifies are complete

Without a way to flush the osd client's notify workqueue, a watch
event that is unregistered could continue receiving callbacks
indefinitely.

Unregistering the event simply means no new notifies are added to the
queue, but there may still be events in the queue that will call the
watch callback for the event. If the queue is flushed after the event
is unregistered, the caller can be sure no more watch callbacks will
occur for the canceled watch.
