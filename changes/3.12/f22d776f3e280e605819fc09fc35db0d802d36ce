vgaarb: Don't disable resources that are not owned

If a device does not own a resource then we don't need to disable it.
This resolves the case where an Intel IGD device can be configured to
disable decode of VGA memory but we still need the arbiter to handle
VGA I/O port routing.  When the IGD device is in conflict, only
PCI_COMMAND_IO should be disabled since VGA memory does not require
arbitration on this device.
