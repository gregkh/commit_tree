powerpc: Stop using non-architected shared_proc field in lppaca

Although the shared_proc field in the lppaca works today, it is
not architected. A shared processor partition will always have a non
zero yield_count so use that instead. Create a wrapper so users
don't have to know about the details.

In order for older kernels to continue to work on KVM we need
to set the shared_proc bit. While here, remove the ugly bitfield.
