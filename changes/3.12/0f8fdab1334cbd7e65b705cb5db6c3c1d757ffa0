ixgbe: fix ethtool reporting of supported links for SFP modules

This patch resolves an issue where the driver will display incorrect info
for Q/SFP+ modules that were inserted after the driver has been loaded.

This patch adds a call to identify_phy() in ixgbe_get_settings() prior to
calling get_link_capabilities() which needs the PHY data in order to
determine the correct settings.
