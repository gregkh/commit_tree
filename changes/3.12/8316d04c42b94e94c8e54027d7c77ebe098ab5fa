serial: sirf: add DMA support using dmaengine APIs

if we get the valid dma channels from dts, move to use dmaengine to do
rx/tx. because the dma hardware requires dma address and length to be
4bytes aligned, in this driver, we will still use PIO for non-aligned
bytes, and use dma for aligned bytes.

for rx, to keep the dmaengine always active, we use double-buffer, so
we issue two dma_desc at first, and maintain the status of both
1. dma transfer done: update in rx dma finish callback
2. dma buffer is inserted into tty: update in rx dma finish tasklet and
   rx timeout tasklet
so we re-issue the dma_desc only if both 1&2 are finished.

for tx, as we know the actual length for every transfer, we don't need
the above double buffering.
