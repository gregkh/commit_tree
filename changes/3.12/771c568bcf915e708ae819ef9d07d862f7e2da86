mtd: nand: add accessors, macros for in-memory BBT

There is an abundance of magic numbers and complicated shifting/masking
logic in the in-memory BBT code which makes the code unnecessary complex
and hard to read.

This patch adds macros to represent the 00b, 01b, 10b, and 11b
memory-BBT magic numbers, as well as two accessor functions for reading
and marking the memory-BBT bitfield for a given block.
