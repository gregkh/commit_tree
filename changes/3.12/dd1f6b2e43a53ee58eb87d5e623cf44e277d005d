dcache: remove dentries from LRU before putting on dispose list

One of the big problems with modifying the way the dcache shrinker and LRU
implementation works is that the LRU is abused in several ways.  One of
these is shrink_dentry_list().

Basically, we can move a dentry off the LRU onto a different list without
doing any accounting changes, and then use dentry_lru_prune() to remove it
from what-ever list it is now on to do the LRU accounting at that point.

This makes it -really hard- to change the LRU implementation.  The use of
the per-sb LRU lock serialises movement of the dentries between the
different lists and the removal of them, and this is the only reason that
it works.  If we want to break up the dentry LRU lock and lists into, say,
per-node lists, we remove the only serialisation that allows this lru
list/dispose list abuse to work.

To make this work effectively, the dispose list has to be isolated from
the LRU list - dentries have to be removed from the LRU *before* being
placed on the dispose list.  This means that the LRU accounting and
isolation is completed before disposal is started, and that means we can
change the LRU implementation freely in future.

This means that dentries *must* be marked with DCACHE_SHRINK_LIST when
they are placed on the dispose list so that we don't think that parent
dentries found in try_prune_one_dentry() are on the LRU when the are
actually on the dispose list.  This would result in accounting the dentry
to the LRU a second time.  Hence dentry_lru_del() has to handle the
DCACHE_SHRINK_LIST case
