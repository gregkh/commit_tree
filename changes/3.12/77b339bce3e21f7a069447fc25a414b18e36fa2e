perf/x86/intel/uncore: Enable EV_SEL_EXT bit for PCU

This patch adds support for the SNB-EP PCU uncore PMU extra_sel_bit
(bit 21) which is missing from the documentation in Table-2.75 of
Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 Product Family Uncore Performance
Monitoring Guide. It is referred to later in Table-2.81. Without
this selection bit explicitly enabled by the kernel, some events
such as COREx_TRANSITION_CYCLES do not count correctly.
