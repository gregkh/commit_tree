HID: hidraw: Add spinlock in struct hidraw to protect list

It is unsafe to call list_for_each_entry in hidraw_report_event to
traverse each hidraw_list node without a lock protection, the list
could be modified if someone calls hidraw_release and list_del to
remove itself from the list, this can cause hidraw_report_event
to touch a deleted list struct and panic.

To prevent this, introduce a spinlock in struct hidraw to protect
list from concurrent access.
