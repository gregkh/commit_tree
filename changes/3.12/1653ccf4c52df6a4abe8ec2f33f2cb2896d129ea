regulator: core: Add support for disabling ramp delay

Some hardwares support disabling ramp delay, so adding ramp_disable flag to
constraints. It will be used to figure out whether ramp_delay in constraints
is explicitly set to zero or its unintialized (zero by default).
And we don't need to call set_voltage_time_sel() for regulators for whom ramp
delay is disabled in constraints.
