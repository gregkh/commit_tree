random: allow architectures to optionally define random_get_entropy()

Allow architectures which have a disabled get_cycles() function to
provide a random_get_entropy() function which provides a fine-grained,
rapidly changing counter that can be used by the /dev/random driver.

For example, an architecture might have a rapidly changing register
used to control random TLB cache eviction, or DRAM refresh that
doesn't meet the requirements of get_cycles(), but which is good
enough for the needs of the random driver.
