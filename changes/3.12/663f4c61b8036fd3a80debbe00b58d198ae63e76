KVM: x86: handle singlestep during emulation

This lets debugging work better during emulation of invalid
guest state.

This time the check is done after emulation, but before writeback
of the flags; we need to check the flags *before* execution of the
instruction, we cannot check singlestep_rip because the CS base may
have already been modified.
