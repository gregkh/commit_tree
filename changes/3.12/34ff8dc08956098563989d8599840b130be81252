memcg: correct RESOURCE_MAX to ULLONG_MAX

Current RESOURCE_MAX is ULONG_MAX, but the value we used to set resource
limit is unsigned long long, so we can set bigger value than that which is
strange.  The XXX_MAX should be reasonable max value, bigger than that
should be overflow.

Notice that this change will affect user output of default *.limit_in_bytes:
before change:

  $ cat /cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes
  9223372036854775807

after change:

  $ cat /cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes
  18446744073709551615

But it doesn't alter the API in term of input - we can still use "echo -1
> *.limit_in_bytes" to reset the numbers to "unlimited".
