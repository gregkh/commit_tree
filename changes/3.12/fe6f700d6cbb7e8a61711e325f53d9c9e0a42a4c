net/mlx4_core: Respond to operation request by firmware

This commit adds new firmware command and new firmware event.  The firmware
raises the MLX4_EVENT_TYPE_OP_REQUIRED event in order to signal the driver it
needs to perform an administrative operation throughout the MLX4_CMD_GET_OP_REQ
command. At the moment the supported operation is adding/removing multicast
entries which are used by the firmware for handling NCSI traffic in B0
steering mode.

Also, had to swap the order of mlx4_init_mcg_table() and
mlx4_init_eq_table() to make sure that driver will get events only after
resources are initialized to handle it.
