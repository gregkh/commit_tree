KVM: x86: update masterclock when kvmclock_offset is calculated (v2)

The offset to add to the hosts monotonic time, kvmclock_offset, is
calculated against the monotonic time at KVM_SET_CLOCK ioctl time.

Request a master clock update at this time, to reduce a potentially
unbounded difference between the values of the masterclock and
the clock value used to calculate kvmclock_offset.
