vhost_net: determine whether or not to use zerocopy at one time

Currently, even if the packet length is smaller than VHOST_GOODCOPY_LEN, if
upend_idx != done_idx we still set zcopy_used to true and rollback this choice
later. This could be avoided by determining zerocopy once by checking all
conditions at one time before.
