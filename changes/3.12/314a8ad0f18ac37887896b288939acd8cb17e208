pidns: fix free_pid() to handle the first fork failure

"case 0" in free_pid() assumes that disable_pid_allocation() should
clear PIDNS_HASH_ADDING before the last pid goes away.

However this doesn't happen if the first fork() fails to create the
child reaper which should call disable_pid_allocation().
