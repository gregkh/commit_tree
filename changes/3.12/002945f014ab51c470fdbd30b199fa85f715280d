extcon: palmas: enable ID_GND and ID_FLOAT detection always

When integrating driver with Tegra platform, it is found that
the ID pins get detected only once after booting system and
further removal and re-insert does not detect the ID pin.

Fixing this issue with enabling interrupt on ID_GND and ID_FLOAT
always  and clearing the status on LATCH register which actually
occurred.

Also if interrupt occurs with line status as zero then based on
previous status, set the cable state.

Add debug prints to display the cable state when any cable
insertion/removal happen.
