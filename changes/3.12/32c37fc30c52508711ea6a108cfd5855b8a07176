usb-storage: add quirk for mandatory READ_CAPACITY_16

Some USB drive enclosures do not correctly report an
overflow condition if they hold a drive with a capacity
over 2TB and are confronted with a READ_CAPACITY_10.
They answer with their capacity modulo 2TB.
The generic layer cannot cope with that. It must be told
to use READ_CAPACITY_16 from the beginning.
