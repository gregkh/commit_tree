net: ipv6: mld: implement RFC3810 MLDv2 mode only

RFC3810, 10. Security Considerations says under subsection 10.1.
Query Message:

  A forged Version 1 Query message will put MLDv2 listeners on that
  link in MLDv1 Host Compatibility Mode. This scenario can be avoided
  by providing MLDv2 hosts with a configuration option to ignore
  Version 1 messages completely.

Hence, implement a MLDv2-only mode that will ignore MLDv1 traffic:

  echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/ethX/force_mld_version  or
  echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/force_mld_version

Note that <all> device has a higher precedence as it was previously
also the case in the macro MLD_V1_SEEN() that would "short-circuit"
if condition on <all> case.
