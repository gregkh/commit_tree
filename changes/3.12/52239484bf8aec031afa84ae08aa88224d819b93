x86/smpboot: Fix announce_cpu() to printk() the last "OK" properly

When booting secondary CPUs, announce_cpu() is called to show which cpu has
been brought up. For example:

[    0.402751] smpboot: Booting Node   0, Processors  #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 OK
[    0.525667] smpboot: Booting Node   1, Processors  #6 #7 #8 #9 #10 #11 OK
[    0.755592] smpboot: Booting Node   0, Processors  #12 #13 #14 #15 #16 #17 OK
[    0.890495] smpboot: Booting Node   1, Processors  #18 #19 #20 #21 #22 #23

But the last "OK" is lost, because 'nr_cpu_ids-1' represents the maximum
possible cpu id. It should use the maximum present cpu id in case not all
CPUs booted up.
