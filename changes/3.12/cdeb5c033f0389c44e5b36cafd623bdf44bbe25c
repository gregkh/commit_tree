rcar-hpbdma: remove shdma_free_irq() calls

Commit c1c63a14f4f2419d093acd7164eccdff315baa86 (DMA: shdma: switch to managed
resource allocation) got rid of shdma_free_irq() but  unfortunately got merged
later than commit c4f6c41ba790bbbfcebb4c47a709ac8ff1fe1af9 (dma: add driver for
R-Car HPB-DMAC), so that the HPB-DMAC driver retained the calls and got broken:

drivers/dma/sh/rcar-hpbdma.c: In function `hpb_dmae_alloc_chan_resources':
drivers/dma/sh/rcar-hpbdma.c:435: error: implicit declaration of function
`shdma_free_irq'

Fix this compilation error by removing the remaining shdma_free_irq() calls.
