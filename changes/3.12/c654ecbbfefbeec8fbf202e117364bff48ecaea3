HWA RC: fix a kernel panic when unplugging the HWA dongle

This patch fixes a kernel panic that can occur when unplugging the HWA
dongle while a downstream device is in the process of disconnecting.
This involved 2 changes.  First, call usb_lock_device_for_reset before
usb_reset_device to synchronize the HWA's post_rest and disconnect
routines.  Second, set the hwarc->neep_urb and hwarc->rd_buffer to NULL
when they are freed in the error path in the post_reset routine.  This
prevents a double free when the disconnect routine is called and attempts
to free those resources again.
