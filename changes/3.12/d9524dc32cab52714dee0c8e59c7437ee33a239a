ARM: cacheflush: don't round address range up to nearest page

The flush_cache_user_range macro takes a pair of addresses describing
the start and end of the virtual address range to flush. Due to an
accidental oversight when flush_cache_range_user was introduced, the
address range was rounded up so that the start and end addresses were
page-aligned.

For historical reference, the interesting commits in history.git are:

10eacf1775e1 ("[ARM] Clean up ARM cache handling interfaces (part 1)")
71432e79b76b ("[ARM] Add flush_cache_user_page() for sys_cacheflush()")

This patch removes the alignment code, reducing the amount of flushing
required for ranges that are not an exact multiple of PAGE_SIZE.
