[SCSI] ufs: Add support for host assisted background operations

Background operations in the UFS device can be disabled by
the host to reduce the response latency of transfer requests.
Add support for enabling/disabling the background operations
during runtime suspend/resume of the device.

If the device is in critical need of BKOPS it will raise an
URGENT_BKOPS exception which should be handled by the host to
make sure the device performs as expected.

During bootup, the BKOPS is enabled in the device by default.
The disable of BKOPS is supported only when the driver supports
runtime suspend/resume operations as the runtime PM framework
provides a way to determine the device idleness and hence BKOPS
can be managed effectively. During runtime resume the BKOPS is
disabled to reduce latency and during runtime suspend the BKOPS
is enabled to allow device to carry out idle time BKOPS.

In some cases where the BKOPS is disabled during runtime resume
and due to continuous data transfers the runtime suspend is not
triggered, the BKOPS is enabled when the device raises a level-2
exception (outstanding operations - performance impact).
