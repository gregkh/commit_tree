gpio: return -ENOTSUPP if debounce cannot be set

It appears some drivers are using gpio_set_debounce()
opportunistically, i.e. without knowing whether it works or
not. (Example: input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c) to account for
this use case, return -ENOTSUPP and do not print any
warnings in this case.

Took a round over the other gpio_set_debounce() consumers
to make sure that none of them are relying on the returned
error code to be something specific.
