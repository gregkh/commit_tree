ARM: tegra: unify Tegra's Kconfig a bit more

Move all common select clauses from ARCH_TEGRA_*_SOC to ARCH_TEGRA to
eliminate duplication. The USB-related selects all should have been
common too, but were missing from Tegra114 previously. Move these to
ARCH_TEGRA too. The latter fixes a build break when only Tegra114
support was enabled, but not Tegra20 or Tegra30 support.
