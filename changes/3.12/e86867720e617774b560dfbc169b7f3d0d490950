mm: mmap_region: kill correct_wcount/inode, use allow_write_access()

correct_wcount and inode in mmap_region() just complicate the code.  This
boolean was needed previously, when deny_write_access() was called before
vma_merge(), now we can simply check VM_DENYWRITE and do
allow_write_access() if it is set.

allow_write_access() checks file != NULL, so this is safe even if it was
possible to use VM_DENYWRITE && !file.  Just we need to ensure we use the
same file which was deny_write_access()'ed, so the patch also moves "file
= vma->vm_file" down after allow_write_access().
