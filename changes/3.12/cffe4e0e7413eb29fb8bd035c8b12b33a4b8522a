cpufreq: Remove unused function __cpufreq_driver_getavg()

The target frequency calculation method in the ondemand governor has
changed and it is now independent of the measured average frequency.
Consequently, the __cpufreq_driver_getavg() function and getavg
member of struct cpufreq_driver are not used any more, so drop them.
