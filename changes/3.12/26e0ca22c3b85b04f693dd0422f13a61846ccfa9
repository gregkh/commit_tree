[media] v4l: Renesas R-Car VSP1 driver

The VSP1 is a video processing engine that includes a blender, scalers,
filters and statistics computation. Configurable data path routing logic
allows ordering the internal blocks in a flexible way.
Due to the configurable nature of the pipeline the driver implements the
media controller API and doesn't use the V4L2 mem-to-mem framework, even
though the device usually operates in memory to memory mode.
Only the read pixel formatters, up/down scalers, write pixel formatters
and LCDC interface are supported at this stage.
