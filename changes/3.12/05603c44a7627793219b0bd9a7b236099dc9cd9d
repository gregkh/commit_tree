ipc: document general ipc locking scheme

As suggested by Andrew, add a generic initial locking scheme used
throughout all sysv ipc mechanisms.  Documenting the ids rwsem, how rcu
can be enough to do the initial checks and when to actually acquire the
kern_ipc_perm.lock spinlock.

I found that adding it to util.c was generic enough.
