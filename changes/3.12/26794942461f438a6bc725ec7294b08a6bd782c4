mm: Fix generic hugetlb pte check return type.

The include/asm-generic/hugetlb.h stubs that just vector huge_pte_*()
calls to the pte_*() implementations won't work in certain situations.

x86 and sparc, for example, return "unsigned long" from the bit
checks, and just go "return pte_val(pte) & PTE_BIT_FOO;"

But since huge_pte_*() returns 'int', if any high bits on 64-bit are
relevant, they get chopped off.

The net effect is that we can loop forever trying to COW a huge page,
because the huge_pte_write() check signals false all the time.
