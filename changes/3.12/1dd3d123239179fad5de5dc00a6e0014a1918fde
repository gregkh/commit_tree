usb: host: Faraday fotg210-hcd driver

FOTG210 is an OTG controller which can be configured as an
USB2.0 host. FOTG210 host is an ehci-like controller with
some differences. First, register layout of FOTG210 is
incompatible with EHCI. Furthermore, FOTG210 is lack of
siTDs which means iTDs are used for both HS and FS ISO
transfer.
