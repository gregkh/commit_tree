drm/i915: silence useless messages about DDI buffer translation

These messages are not really useful since it's very easy to check
which mode is used for each port: The values programmed are based on
the port type, then assigned to the ddi_translations variable.
Currently we use DP mode for ports A-D and FDI mode for port E.

Also, when we add the code to enable/disable PC8+,
intel_prepare_ddi_buffers will be called more often and will eat your
dmesg buffers.

While at it, fix the coding style of the "for" statement above.

how the ddi translation buffer settings are computed, to answer a
question from Chris.]
