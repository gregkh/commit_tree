ASoC: dapm: Move 'value' field from widget to control

The 'value' field is really per control and not per widget. Currently it is only
used for virtual MUXes, which only have one control per widget. So in that case
there is not so much of a difference between whether it is stored per widget or
per control. Moving the 'value' field from the widget to the control will allow
us to use it also for cases where we have more than one control per widget. E.g.
for mixers with multiple input controls.
