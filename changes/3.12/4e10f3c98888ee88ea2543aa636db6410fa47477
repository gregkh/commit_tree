Kill indirect include of file.h from eventfd.h, use fdget() in cgroup.c

kernel/cgroup.c is the only place in the tree that relies on eventfd.h
pulling file.h; move that include there.  Switch from eventfd_fget()/fput()
to fdget()/fdput(), while we are at it - eventfd_ctx_fileget() will fail
on non-eventfd descriptors just fine, no need to do that check twice...
