drm/i915/hsw: Set correct Haswell PTE encodings.

On the surface it would seem setting a default age wouldn't matter
because all GEM BOs are aged similarly, so the order in which objects
are evicted would not be subject to aging. The current working theory as
to why this caused a regression though is that LLC is a bit special in
that it is shared with the CPU. Presumably (not verified) the CPU
fetches cachelines with age 3, and therefore recently cached GPU objects
would be evicted before similar CPU object first when the LLC is full.
It stands to reason therefore that this would negatively impact CPU
bound benchmarks - but those seem to be low on the priority list.

eLLC OTOH does not have this same property as LLC. It should be used
entirely for the GPU, and so the age really shouldn't matter.
Furthermore, we have no evidence to suggest one is better than another
on eLLC. Since we've never properly supported eLLC before no, there
should be no regression. If the GPU client really wants "younger"
objects, they should use MOCS.

v2: Drop the extra #define (Chad)

v3: Actually git add
