Revert "select: use freezable blocking call"

This reverts commit 9745cdb36da8 (select: use freezable blocking call)
that triggers problems during resume from suspend to RAM on Paul Bolle's
32-bit x86 machines.  Paul says:

  Ever since I tried running (release candidates of) v3.11 on the two
  working i686s I still have lying around I ran into issues on resuming
  from suspend. Reverting 9745cdb36da8 (select: use freezable blocking
  call) resolves those issues.

  Resuming from suspend on i686 on (release candidates of) v3.11 and
  later triggers issues like:

  traps: systemd[1] general protection ip:b738e490 sp:bf882fc0 error:0 in libc-2.16.so[b731c000+1b0000]

  and

  traps: rtkit-daemon[552] general protection ip:804d6e5 sp:b6cb32f0 error:0 in rtkit-daemon[8048000+d000]

  Once I hit the systemd error I can only get out of the mess that the
  system is at that point by power cycling it.

Since we are reverting another freezer-related change causing similar
problems to happen, this one should be reverted as well.
