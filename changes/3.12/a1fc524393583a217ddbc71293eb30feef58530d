staging: dwc2: properly mask the GRXFSIZ register

Bits 16-31 are reserved, so the old code just reads the whole register to
get bits 0-15, assuming the reserved bits would be 0 (which seems true
on current hardware, but who knows...).

This commit properly masks out the reserved bits when reading and
doesn't touch the reserved bits while writing.
