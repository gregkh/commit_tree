ACPI / PM: Drop two functions that are not used any more

Two functions defined in device_pm.c, acpi_dev_pm_add_dependent()
and acpi_dev_pm_remove_dependent(), have no callers and may be
dropped, so drop them.

Moreover, they are the only functions adding entries to and removing
entries from the power_dependent list in struct acpi_device, so drop
that list too.
