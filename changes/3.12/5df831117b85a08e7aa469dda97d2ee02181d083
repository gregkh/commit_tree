serial: sirf: make the driver also support USP-based UART

Universal Serial Ports (USP) can be used as PCM, UART, SPI,
I2S etc. this makes the USP work as UART. the basic work
flow is same with UART controller, the main difference will
be offset of registers and bits.

this patch makes the old sirfsoc uart driver support both
sirf UART and USP-based UART by making their differences
become private data.
