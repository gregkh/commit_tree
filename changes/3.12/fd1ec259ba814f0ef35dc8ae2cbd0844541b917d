perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add filter support for QPI boxes

The QPI uncore boxes have two pairs of MATCH/MASK registers that
user to filter packet traffic serviced by QPI link layer. These
registers are in auxiliary PCI devices.

This patch adds the auxiliary PCI devices to snbep_uncore_pci_ids
and adds field definitions for the MATCH/MASK registers.
