dmaengine: PL08x: Add support for different maximum transfer size

PL080S has separate register to store transfer size in, allowing single
transfer to be much larger than in standard PL080.

This patch makes the amba-pl08x driver aware of this and removes writing
transfer size to reserved bits of CH_CONTROL register on PL080S, which
was not a problem witn transfer sizes fitting the original bitfield
of PL080, but now would overwrite other fields.
