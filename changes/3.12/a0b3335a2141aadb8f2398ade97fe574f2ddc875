drm/i915: simplify rps interrupt enabling/disabling sequence

At the moment we have the following interrupt enabling sequence:
1. irq preinstall hook
2. enabling the interrupt handler and calling irq postinstall hook
3. enable rps interrupts from the async work

And the folliwing disable sequence:
1. disabling the interrupt handler and calling the uninstall hook
2. disabling the rps interrupt

Since the postinstall hook now always sets up PMIIR, PMIER and PMIMR
to known-good states there no way for an interrupt to sneak in in the
enable sequence, so we can reinstate the WARN lost in

    drm/i915: Add PM regs to pre/post install

Note that there's some room for future cleanups since most of the
interrupt register clearing in the disable function is rather
redundant. But that's better done in follow-up patches, if at all.
