ARM: KVM: vgic: Bump VGIC_NR_IRQS to 256

The Versatile Express TC2 board, which we use as our main emulated
platform in QEMU, defines 160+32 == 192 interrupts, so limiting the
number of interrupts to 128 is not quite going to cut it for real board
emulation.

Note that this didn't use to be a problem because QEMU was buggy and
only defined 128 interrupts until recently.
