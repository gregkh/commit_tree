MIPS: DMA: For BMIPS5000 cores flush region just like non-coherent R10000

The BMIPS5000 (Zephyr) processor utilizes instruction speculation. A
stale misprediction address in either the JTB or the CRS may trigger
a prefetch inside a region that is currently being used by a DMA engine,
which is not IO-coherent.  This prefetch will fetch a line into the
scache, and that line will soon become stale (ie wrong) during/after the
DMA.  Mayhem ensues.

In dma-default.c, the r10000 is handled as a special case in the same way
that we want to handle Zephyr.  So we generalize the exception cases into
a function, and include Zephyr as one of the processors that needs this
special care.
