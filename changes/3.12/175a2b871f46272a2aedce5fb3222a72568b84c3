Btrfs: don't allow a subvol to be deleted if it is the default subovl

Eric pointed out that btrfs will happily allow you to delete the default subvol.
This is a problem obviously since the next time you go to mount the file system
it will freak out because it can't find the root.  Fix this by adding a check to
see if our default subvol points to the subvol we are trying to delete, and if
it does not allowing it to happen.  Thanks,
