gpiolib: let gpiod_request() return -EPROBE_DEFER

Patch be1a4b brought some improvements to the GPIO error handling code,
but also changed the return value of gpiod_request() when called on a
not yet initialized GPIO descriptor: it now returns -EINVAL instead of
-EPROBE_DEFER, and this affects some drivers.

This patch restores the original behavior for gpiod_request(). It is
safe to do so now that desc_to_gpio() does not rely on the GPIO
descriptor to be initialized. Other functions changed by patch be1a4b
do not see their return value affected, so these are not reverted.
