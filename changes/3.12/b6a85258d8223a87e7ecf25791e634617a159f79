NFS: Fix warning introduced by NFSv4.0 transport blocking patches

When CONFIG_NFS_V4_1 is not enabled, gcc emits this warning:

linux/fs/nfs/nfs4state.c:255:12: warning:
 ‘nfs4_begin_drain_session’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
 static int nfs4_begin_drain_session(struct nfs_client *clp)
            ^

Eventually NFSv4.0 migration recovery will invoke this function, but
that has not yet been merged.  Hide nfs4_begin_drain_session()
behind CONFIG_NFS_V4_1 for now.
