writeback: Do not sort b_io list only because of block device inode

It is very likely that block device inode will be part of BDI dirty list
as well. However it doesn't make sence to sort inodes on the b_io list
just because of this inode (as it contains buffers all over the device
anyway). So save some CPU cycles which is valuable since we hold relatively
contented wb->list_lock.
