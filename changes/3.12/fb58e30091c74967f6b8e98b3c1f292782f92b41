x86/xen: disable premption when enabling local irqs

If CONFIG_PREEMPT is enabled then xen_enable_irq() (and
xen_restore_fl()) could be preempted and rescheduled on a different
VCPU in between the clear of the mask and the check for pending
events.  This may result in events being lost as the upcall will check
for pending events on the wrong VCPU.

Fix this by disabling preemption around the unmask and check for
events.
