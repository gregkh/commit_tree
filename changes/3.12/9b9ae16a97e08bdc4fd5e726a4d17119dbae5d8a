ASoC: Samsung: Do not queue cyclic buffers multiple times

The legacy S3C-DMA API required every period of a cyclic buffer to be
queued separately. After conversion of Samsung ASoC to Samsung DMA
wrappers somebody made an assumption that the same is needed for DMA
engine API, which is not true.

In effect, Samsung ASoC DMA code was queuing the whole cyclic buffer
multiple times with a shift of one period per iteration, leading to:
  a) severe memory waste - up to 13x times more DMA transfer descriptors
     are allocated than needed,
  b) possible memory corruption, because further cyclic buffers were out
     of the original buffers, due to the offset.

This patch fixes this problem by making the legacy S3C-DMA API use the
same semantics as DMA engine (the whole cyclic buffer is enqueued at
once) and modifying users of Samsung DMA wrappers in cyclic mode to
behave appropriately.
