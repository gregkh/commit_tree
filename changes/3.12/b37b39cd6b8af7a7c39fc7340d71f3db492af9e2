Btrfs: cleanup reloc roots properly on error

I was hitting the BUG_ON() at the end of merge_reloc_roots() because we were
aborting the transaction at some point previously and then getting an error when
we tried to drop the reloc root.  I fixed btrfs_drop_snapshot to re-add us to
the dead roots list if we failed, but this isn't the right thing to do for reloc
roots since it uses root->root_list for it's own stuff in order to know what
needs to be cleaned up.  So fix btrfs_drop_snapshot to only do the re-add if we
aren't dropping for reloc, and handle errors from merge_reloc_root() by dropping
the reloc root we are processing since it won't be on the list of roots to
cleanup.  With this patch my reproducer no longer panics.  Thanks,
