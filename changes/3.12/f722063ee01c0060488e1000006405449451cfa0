dm space map: optimise sm_ll_dec and sm_ll_inc

Prior to this patch these methods did a lookup followed by an insert.
Instead they now call a common mutate function that adjusts the value
according to a callback function.  This avoids traversing the data
structures twice and hence improves performance.

Also factor out sm_ll_lookup_big_ref_count() for use by both
sm_ll_lookup() and sm_ll_mutate().
