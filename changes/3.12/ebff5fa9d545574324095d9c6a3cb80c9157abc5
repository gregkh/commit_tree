Revert "i915: Update VGA arbiter support for newer devices"

This reverts commit 81b5c7bc8de3e6f63419139c2fc91bf81dea8a7d.

Adding drm/i915 into the vga arbiter chain means that X (in a piece of
well-meant paranoia) will do a get/put on the vga decoding around
_every_ accel call down into the ddx. Which results in some nice
performance disasters [1]. This really breaks userspace, by disabling
DRI for everyone, and stops OpenGL from working, this isn't limited
to just the i915 but both the integrated and discrete GPUs on
multi-gpu systems, in other words this causes untold worlds of pain,

Ville tried to come up with a Great Hack to fiddle the required VGA
I/O ops behind everyone's back using stop_machine, but that didn't
really work out [2]. Given that we're fairly late in the -rc stage for
such games let's just revert this all.

One thing we might want to keep is to delay the disabling of the vga
decoding until the fbdev emulation and the fbcon screen is set up. If
we kill vga mem decoding beforehand fbcon can end up with a white
square in the top-left corner it tried to save from the vga memory for
a seamless transition. And we have bug reports on older platforms
which seem to match these symptoms.

But again that's something to play around with in -next.
