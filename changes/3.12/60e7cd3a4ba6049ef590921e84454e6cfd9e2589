Btrfs: fix transid verify errors when recovering log tree

If we crash with a log, remount and recover that log, and then crash before we
can commit another transaction we will get transid verify errors on the next
mount.  This is because we were not zero'ing out the log when we committed the
transaction after recovery.  This is ok as long as we commit another transaction
at some point in the future, but if you abort or something else goes wrong you
can end up in this weird state because the recovery stuff says that the tree log
should have a generation+1 of the super generation, which won't be the case of
the transaction that was started for recovery.  Fix this by removing the check
and _always_ zero out the log portion of the super when we commit a transaction.
This fixes the transid verify issues I was seeing with my force errors tests.
