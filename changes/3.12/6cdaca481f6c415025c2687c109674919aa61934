ARM: edma: Fix clearing of unused list for DT DMA resources

HWMOD removal for MMC is breaking edma_start as the events are being manually
triggered due to unused channel list not being clear.

The above issue is fixed by reading the "dmas" property from the DT node if it
exists and clearing the bits in the unused channel list if the dma controller
used by any device is EDMA. For this purpose we use the of_* helpers to parse
the arguments in the dmas phandle list.

Also introduced is a minor clean up of a checkpatch error in old code.
