[media] exynos4-is: Fix fimc-lite bayer formats

The 10-bit and 12-bit Bayer output formats supported by FIMC-LITE
actually use 16 bits where the extra bits are padded with zeros.
The patch corrects buffer allocation for these two formats by
modifying the depth field. This prevents memory corruption by the
output DMA due to insufficient buffer size.
