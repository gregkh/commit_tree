rbd: fix error handling from rbd_snap_name()

rbd_snap_name() calls rbd_dev_v{1,2}_snap_name() depending on the
format of the image. The format 1 version returns NULL on error, which
is handled by the caller. The format 2 version returns an ERR_PTR,
which the caller of rbd_snap_name() does not expect.

Fortunately this is unlikely to occur in practice because
rbd_snap_id_by_name() is called before rbd_snap_name(). This would hit
similar errors to rbd_snap_name() (like the snapshot not existing) and
return early, so rbd_snap_name() would not hit an error unless the
snapshot was removed between the two calls or memory was exhausted.

Use an ERR_PTR in rbd_dev_v1_snap_name() so that the specific error
can be propagated, and it is consistent with rbd_dev_v2_snap_name().
Handle the ERR_PTR in the only rbd_snap_name() caller.
