aoe: remove do-nothing NAME="%k" term from example udev rules

When the example udev rules in the documentation are used without
modification, warnings like the one shown below appear in the system logs:

  /var/log/messages:Aug 22 11:09:11 kung udevd[445]: NAME="%k" \
    is superfluous and breaks kernel supplied names, please remove \
    it from /etc/udev/rules.d/60-aoe.rules:26

Removing the term does not cause any problems with the creation of the
special character and block device nodes.
