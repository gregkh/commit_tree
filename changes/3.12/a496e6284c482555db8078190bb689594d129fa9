serial: imx: distinguish the imx6q uart from the others

We will add the DMA support for the imx uart. For the firmware's limit,
only the imx6 serial chips (including the imx6q, imx6dl, imx6sl) can
support the DMA.

This patch adds the necessary macro and helper to distinguish the
imx6q uart from the other imx uart. Other chips can use the "fsl,imx6q-uart"
to enable the DMA support.

This patch also replaces the check "is_imx21_uart()" with "!is_imx1_uart()".
