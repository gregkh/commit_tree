ARM: dts: msm: Update uartdm compatible strings

Let's follow the ratified DT binding and use uartdm instead of
hsuart. This does break backwards compatibility but this
shouldn't be a problem because the uart driver isn't probing on
these devices without adding clock support (which isn't merged so
far).
