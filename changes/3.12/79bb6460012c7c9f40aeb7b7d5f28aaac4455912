gpio-tz1090-pdc: add TZ1090 PDC gpio driver

Add a GPIO driver for the low-power Powerdown Controller GPIOs in the
TZ1090 SoC.

The driver is instantiated by device tree and supports interrupts for
the SysWake GPIOs only.

Changes in v4:
 - fix typos in DT bindings compatible properties
 - reference Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt in
   gpio-ranges description in DT bindings
 - fix gpio-ranges examples in DT bindings (it must now have 3 cells)

Changes in v3:
 - separated from irq-imgpdc and removed arch/metag changes to allow
   these patches to go upstream separately via the pinctrl[/gpio] trees
   (particularly the pinctrl drivers depend on the new pinconf DT
   bindings).
 - some s/unsigned/unsigned int/.
 - gpio-tz1090*: refer to <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h> and
   <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h> flags in bindings.
 - gpio-tz1090*: move initcall from postcore to subsys.

Changes in v2:
 - gpio-tz1090-pdc: remove references to Linux flags in dt bindings
 - gpio-tz1090-pdc: make use of BIT() from linux/bitops.h
 - gpio-tz1090-pdc: make register accessors inline to match pinctrl
 - gpio-tz1090-pdc: update gpio-ranges to use 3 cells after recent ABI
   breakage
