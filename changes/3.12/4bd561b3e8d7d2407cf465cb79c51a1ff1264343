drm/i915: cleanup map&fence in bind

Cleanup the map and fenceable setting during bind to make more sense,
and not check i915_is_ggtt() 2 unnecessary times

v2: Move the bools into the if block (Chris) - There are ways to tidy
this function (fence calculations for instance) even further, but they
are quite invasive, so I am punting on those unless specifically asked.

v3: Add newline between variable declaration and logic (Chris)
