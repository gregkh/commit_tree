drm/omap: use flip-work helper

And simplify how we hold a ref+pin to what is being scanned out by using
fb refcnt'ing.  The previous logic pre-dated fb refcnt, and as a result
was less straightforward than it could have been.  By holding a ref to
the fb, we don't have to care about how many plane's there are and
holding a ref to each color plane's bo.
