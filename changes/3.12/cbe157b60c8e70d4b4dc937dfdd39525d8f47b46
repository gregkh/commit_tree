net: calxedaxgmac: fix race with tx queue stop/wake

Since the xgmac transmit start and completion work locklessly, it is
possible for xgmac_xmit to stop the tx queue after the xgmac_tx_complete
has run resulting in the tx queue never being woken up. Fix this by
ensuring that ring buffer index updates are visible and recheck the ring
space after stopping the queue. Also fix an off-by-one bug where we need
to stop the queue when the ring buffer space is equal to MAX_SKB_FRAGS.

The implementation used here was copied from
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/tg3.c.
