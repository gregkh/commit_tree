cpu topology: remove stale arch_provides_topology_pointers and define_siblings_show_map/list()

arch_provides_topology_pointers was introduced in commit 23ca4bba3 (x86:
cleanup early per cpu variables/accesses v4) to indicate pointers to the
topology cpumask_t maps are valid to avoid copying data on to/off of the
stack.

But later in commit fbd59a8d (cpumask: Use topology_core_cpumask()/
topology_thread_cpumask()), the pointers to the topology struct cpumask maps
are always valid.

After that commit, the only difference is that there is a redundant
"unsigned int cpu = dev->id;" if arch_provides_topology_pointers defined, but
dev->id is type 'u32' which devolves to 'unsigned int' on all supported arches.
So this arch_provides_topology_pointers define is pointless and only cause
obfuscation now, remove it.

Tested on x86 machine, topology information in sys/devices/system/cpu/
cpuX/topology/ is the same after appling this patch set.
