drm/i915: Update error capture for VMs

formerly: "drm/i915: Create VMAs (part 4) - Error capture"

Since the active/inactive lists are per VM, we need to modify the error
capture code to be aware of this, and also extend it to capture the
buffers from all the VMs. For now all the code assumes only 1 VM, but it
will become more generic over the next few patches.

NOTE: If the number of VMs in a real world system grows significantly
we'll have to focus on only capturing the guilty VM, or else it's likely
there won't be enough space for error capture.

v2: Squashed in the "part 6" which had dependencies on the mm_list
change. Since I've moved the mm_list change to an earlier point in the
series, we were able to accomplish it here and now.

v3: Rebased over new error capture
