vfs: use __getname/__putname for getcwd() system call

It's a pathname.  It should use the pathname allocators and
deallocators, and PATH_MAX instead of PAGE_SIZE.  Never mind that the
two are commonly the same.

With this, the allocations scale up nicely too, and I can do getcwd()
system calls at a rate of about 300M/s, with no lock contention
anywhere.

Of course, nobody sane does that, especially since getcwd() is
traditionally a very slow operation in Unix.  But this was also the
simplest way to benchmark the prepend_path() improvements by Waiman, and
once I saw the profiles I couldn't leave it well enough alone.

But apart from being an performance improvement (from using per-cpu slab
allocators instead of the raw page allocator), it's actually a valid and
real cleanup.
