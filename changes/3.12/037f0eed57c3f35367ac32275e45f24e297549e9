powerpc: Make flush_fp_to_thread() nop when CONFIG_PPC_FPU is disabled

In the current kernel, the function flush_fp_to_thread() is not
dependent on CONFIG_PPC_FPU. So most invocations of this function
is not wrapped by CONFIG_PPC_FPU. Even through we don't really
save the FPRs to the thread struct if CONFIG_PPC_FPU is not enabled,
but there does have some runtime overhead such as the check for
tsk->thread.regs and preempt disable and enable. It really make
no sense to do that. So make it a nop when CONFIG_PPC_FPU is
disabled. Also remove the wrapped #ifdef CONFIG_PPC_FPU
when invoking this function.
