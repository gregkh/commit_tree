drm/nv50/disp: prevent false output detection on the original nv50

Commit ea9197cc323839ef3d5280c0453b2c622caa6bc7 effectively enabled the
use of an improved DAC detection code, but introduced a regression on
the original nv50 chipset, causing a ghost monitor to be detected.

v2 (Ben Skeggs): the offending line was likely a thinko, removed it for
all chipsets (tested nv50 and nve6 to cover entire range) and added
some additional debugging.
