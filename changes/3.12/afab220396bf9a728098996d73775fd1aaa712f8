serial: mxs: remove the MXS_AUART_DMA_CONFIG

The MXS_AUART_DMA_CONFIG is originally used to check if the DT node
is configured with the DMA property.

But now, the MXS_AUART_DMA_CONFIG is set unconditionally in the
serial_mxs_probe_dt(), so the check in the mxs_auart_settermios() is
not necessary anymore. This patch removes this macro.
