f2fs: update file name in the inode block during f2fs_rename

The error is reproducible by:
0. mkfs.f2fs /dev/sdb1 & mount
1. touch test1
2. touch test2
3. mv test1 test2
4. umount
5. dumpt.f2fs -i 4 /dev/sdb1

After this, when we retrieve the inode->i_name of test2 by dump.f2fs, we get
test1 instead of test2.
This is because f2fs didn't update the file name during the f2fs_rename.

So, this patch fixes that.
