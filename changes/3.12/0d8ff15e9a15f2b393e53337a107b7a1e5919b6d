drm/i915/hsw: Set correct Haswell PTE encodings.

The cacheability controls have changed, and the bits have been
rearranged in general.

Note that age 0 is the oldest (most likely to get evicted) and age 3
is the youngest (most likely to stick around for a bit). We've picked
0 for no reason, but atm it shouldn't matter anyway (since we don't
yet try to differentiate between different objects).

v2: Remove comments for snb/ivb cache leves, that's a separate change.

v3: Resolve conflicts due to patch series reordering.

v4: Rebased on top of Kenneth Graunke's ->pte_encode refactoring.

v5: Removed eLLC bits for separate patch.
