batman-adv: set the TAG flag for the vid passed to BLA

When receiving or sending a packet a packet on a VLAN, the
vid has to be marked with the TAG flag in order to make any
component in batman-adv understand that the packet is coming
from a really tagged network.

This fix the Bridge Loop Avoidance behaviour which was not
able to send announces over VLAN interfaces.
