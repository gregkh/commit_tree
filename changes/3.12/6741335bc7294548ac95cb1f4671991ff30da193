Drivers: hv: util: Fix a bug in version negotiation code for util services

The current code picked the highest version advertised by the host. WS2012 R2
has implemented a protocol version for KVP that is not compatible with prior
protocol versions of KVP. Fix the bug in the current code by explicitly specifying
the protocol version that the guest can support.
