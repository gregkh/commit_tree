usb: chipidea: add flag CI_HDRC_DUAL_ROLE_NOT_OTG

Since we need otgsc to know vbus's status at some chipidea
controllers even it is peripheral-only mode. Besides, some
SoCs (eg, AR9331 SoC) don't have otgsc register even
the DCCPARAMS_DC and DCCPARAMS_HC are both 1 at CAP_DCCPARAMS.

We inroduce flag CI_HDRC_DUAL_ROLE_NOT_OTG to indicate if the
controller is dual role, but not supports OTG. If this flag is
not set, we follow the rule that if DCCPARAMS_DC and DCCPARAMS_HC
are both 1 at CAP_DCCPARAMS, then this controller is otg capable.
