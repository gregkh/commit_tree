vfio-pci: PCI hot reset interface

The current VFIO_DEVICE_RESET interface only maps to PCI use cases
where we can isolate the reset to the individual PCI function.  This
means the device must support FLR (PCIe or AF), PM reset on D3hot->D0
transition, device specific reset, or be a singleton device on a bus
for a secondary bus reset.  FLR does not have widespread support,
PM reset is not very reliable, and bus topology is dictated by the
system and device design.  We need to provide a means for a user to
induce a bus reset in cases where the existing mechanisms are not
available or not reliable.

This device specific extension to VFIO provides the user with this
ability.  Two new ioctls are introduced:
 - VFIO_DEVICE_PCI_GET_HOT_RESET_INFO
 - VFIO_DEVICE_PCI_HOT_RESET

The first provides the user with information about the extent of
devices affected by a hot reset.  This is essentially a list of
devices and the IOMMU groups they belong to.  The user may then
initiate a hot reset by calling the second ioctl.  We must be
careful that the user has ownership of all the affected devices
found via the first ioctl, so the second ioctl takes a list of file
descriptors for the VFIO groups affected by the reset.  Each group
must have IOMMU protection established for the ioctl to succeed.
