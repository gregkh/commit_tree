drm/i915/sdvo: Fully translate sync flags in the dtd->mode conversion

Instead of just a flag bit for each of the positive/negative sync
modes drm actually uses a separate flag for each ... This upsets the
modeset checker since the adjusted mode filled out at modeset time
doesn't match the one reconstructed at check time (since the
->get_config callback already gets this right).
