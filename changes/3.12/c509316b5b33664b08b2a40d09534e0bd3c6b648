bonding: simplify bond_3ad_update_lacp_rate and use RTNL for sync

We can drop the use of bond->lock for mutual exclusion in
bond_3ad_update_lacp_rate and use RTNL in the sysfs store function
instead. This way we'll prevent races with mode change and interface
up/down as well as simplify update_lacp_rate by removing the check for
port->slave because it'll always be initialized (done while enslaving
with RTNL). This change will also help in the future removal of reader
bond->lock from bond_enslave.
