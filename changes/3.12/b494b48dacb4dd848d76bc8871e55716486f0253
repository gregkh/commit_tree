cpufreq: imx6q-cpufreq: assign cpu_dev correctly to cpu0 device

Commit cdc58d602d2e657602a90c190cbf745886c95977 "cpufreq: imx6q-cpufreq:
remove device tree parsing for cpu nodes" assumed the pdev->dev is set to
cpu0 device in the platform code. But it actually points to the virtual
cpufreq-cpu0 platform device which is not present in the device tree.
Most of the information needed by cpufreq is stored in cpu0 DT node.
So cpu_dev must point to cpu0 device.

This patch fixes the wrong assignment to cpu_dev.
