dma: imx-sdma: Add ROM script addresses to driver

This adds the ROM script addresses for i.MX25, i.MX5x and i.MX6 to the
SDMA driver needed for the driver to work without additional firmware.

The ROM script addresses are SoC specific and in some cases even tapeout
specific. This patch adds the ROM script addresses only for SoCs which
do not have a tapeout specific SDMA ROM, because currently it's unclear
how this case should be handled.
