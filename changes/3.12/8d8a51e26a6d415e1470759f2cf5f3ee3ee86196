l2tp: Fix build warning with ipv6 disabled.

net/l2tp/l2tp_core.c: In function ‘l2tp_verify_udp_checksum’:
net/l2tp/l2tp_core.c:499:22: warning: unused variable ‘tunnel’ [-Wunused-variable]

Create a helper "l2tp_tunnel()" to facilitate this, and as a side
effect get rid of a bunch of unnecessary void pointer casts.
