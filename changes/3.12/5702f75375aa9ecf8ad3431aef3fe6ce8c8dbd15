usb: gadget: udc-core: move sysfs_notify() to a workqueue

usb_gadget_set_state() will call sysfs_notify()
which might sleep. Some users might want to call
usb_gadget_set_state() from the very IRQ handler
which actually changes the gadget state.

Instead of having every UDC driver add their own
workqueue for such a simple notification, we're
adding it generically to our struct usb_gadget,
so the details are hidden from all UDC drivers.
