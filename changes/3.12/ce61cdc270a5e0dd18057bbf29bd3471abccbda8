tile: make __write_once a synonym for __read_mostly

This was really only useful for TILE64 when we mapped the
kernel data with small pages. Now we use a huge page and we
really don't want to map different parts of the kernel
data in different ways.

We retain the __write_once name in case we want to bring
it back to life at some point in the future.

Note that this change uncovered a latent bug where the
"smp_topology" variable happened to always be aligned mod 8
so we could store two "int" values at once, but when we
eliminated __write_once it ended up only aligned mod 4.
Fix with an explicit annotation.
