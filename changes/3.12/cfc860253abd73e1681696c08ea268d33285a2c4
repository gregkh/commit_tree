KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix typo in saving DSCR

This fixes a typo in the code that saves the guest DSCR (Data Stream
Control Register) into the kvm_vcpu_arch struct on guest exit.  The
effect of the typo was that the DSCR value was saved in the wrong place,
so changes to the DSCR by the guest didn't persist across guest exit
and entry, and some host kernel memory got corrupted.
