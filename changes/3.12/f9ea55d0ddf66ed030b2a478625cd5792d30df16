 perf sort: Separate out memory-specific sort keys

He wrote

 For global/local weights, I'm not entirely sure to place them into the
 memory dimension.  But it's the only user at this time.

Well TSX is another (in fact the original) user of the flags, and it
needs them to be common. So move local/global weight back to the common
sort keys.
