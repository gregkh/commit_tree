clocksource: em_sti: Set cpu_possible_mask to fix SMP broadcast

Update the STI driver by setting cpu_possible_mask to make EMEV2
SMP work as expected together with the ARM broadcast timer.

This breakage was introduced by:

f7db706 ARM: 7674/1: smp: Avoid dummy clockevent being preferred over real hardware clock-event

Without this fix SMP operation is broken on EMEV2 since no
broadcast timer interrupts trigger on the secondary CPU cores.
