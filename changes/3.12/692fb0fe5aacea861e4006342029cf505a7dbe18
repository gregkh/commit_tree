spi/sirf: fix the misunderstanding about len of spi_transfer

the unit of len of spi_transfer is in bytes, not in spi words. the
old codes misunderstood that and thought the len is the amount of
spi words. but it is actually how many bytes existing in the spi
buffer.

this patch fixes that and also rename left_tx_cnt and left_rx_cnt
to left_tx_word and left_rx_word to highlight they are in words.
