target: Fix trailing ASCII space usage in INQUIRY vendor+model

This patch fixes spc_emulate_inquiry_std() to add trailing ASCII
spaces for INQUIRY vendor + model fields following SPC-4 text:

  "ASCII data fields described as being left-aligned shall have any
   unused bytes at the end of the field (i.e., highest offset) and
   the unused bytes shall be filled with ASCII space characters (20h)."

This addresses a problem with Falconstor NSS multipathing.
