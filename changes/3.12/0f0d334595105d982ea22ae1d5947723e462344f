xfs: fix bad dquot buffer size in log recovery readahead

xfstests xfs/087 fails 100% reliably with this assert:

XFS (vdb): Mounting Filesystem
XFS (vdb): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)
XFS: Assertion failed: bp->b_flags & XBF_STALE, file: fs/xfs/xfs_buf.c, line: 548

while trying to read a dquot buffer in xlog_recover_dquot_ra_pass2().

The issue is that the buffer length to read that is passed to
xfs_buf_readahead is in units of filesystem blocks, not disk blocks.
(i.e. FSB, not daddr). Fix it but putting the correct conversion in
place.
