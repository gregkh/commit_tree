HID: Add new driver for non-compliant Xin-Mo devices.

The driver currently only supports the Dual Arcade controller.
It fixes the negative axis event values (the devices sends -2) to match the
logical axis minimum of the HID report descriptor (the report announces -1).
It is needed because hid-input discards out of bounds values.
