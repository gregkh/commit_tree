spi: altera: Simplify altera_spi_txrx implementation for noirq case

This patch simplifies the code and makes it better in readability.
Now the logic in the while loop is simply
"write to ALTERA_SPI_TXDATA then read from ALTERA_SPI_TXDATA".

There is a slightly logic change because now we avoid a read-write cycle when
hw->len is 0. Since the code in bitbang library will call bitbang->txrx_bufs()
only when t->len is not 0, this is not a problem.
