i40e: better return values

As mentioned by Joe Perches, clean up return values in some functions
making sure to have consistent return types, not mixing types.

A couple of Joe's comments suggested returning void, but since
the functions in question are ndo defined, the return values are fixed.
So make a comment in the header that notes this is a function called by
net_device_ops.
