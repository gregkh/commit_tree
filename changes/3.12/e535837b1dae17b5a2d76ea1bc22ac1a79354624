cgroup: remove struct cgroup_scanner

cgroup_scan_tasks() takes a pointer to struct cgroup_scanner as its
sole argument and the only function of that struct is packing the
arguments of the function call which are consisted of five fields.
It's not too unusual to pack parameters into a struct when the number
of arguments gets excessive or the whole set needs to be passed around
a lot, but neither holds here making it just weird.

Drop struct cgroup_scanner and pass the params directly to
cgroup_scan_tasks().  Note that struct cpuset_change_nodemask_arg was
added to cpuset.c to pass both ->cs and ->newmems pointer to
cpuset_change_nodemask() using single data pointer.

This doesn't make any functional differences.
