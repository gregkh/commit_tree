Btrfs: create UUID tree if required

This tree is not created by mkfs.btrfs. Therefore when a filesystem
is mounted writable and the UUID tree does not exist, this tree is
created if required. The tree is also added to the fs_info structure
and initialized, but this commit does not yet read or write UUID tree
elements.
