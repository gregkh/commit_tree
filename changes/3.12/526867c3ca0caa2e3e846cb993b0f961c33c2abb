xhci: Fix race between ep halt and URB cancellation

The halted state of a endpoint cannot be cleared over CLEAR_HALT from a
user process, because the stopped_td variable was overwritten in the
handle_stopped_endpoint() function. So the xhci_endpoint_reset() function will
refuse the reset and communication with device can not run over this endpoint.
