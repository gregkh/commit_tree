cpuset: drop "const" qualifiers from struct cpuset instances

cpuset uses "const" qualifiers on struct cpuset in some functions;
however, it doesn't work well when a value derived from returned const
pointer has to be passed to an accessor.  It's C after all.

Drop the "const" qualifiers except for the trivially leaf ones.  This
patch doesn't make any functional changes.
