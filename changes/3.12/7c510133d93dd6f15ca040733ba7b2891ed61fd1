drm: mark context support as a legacy subsystem

So after a lot of digging around in git histories it looks like this
has only ever be used by dri1 render clients. Hence we can fully
disable the entire thing for modesetting drivers and so greatly reduce
the attack surface for potential exploits (or at least tools like
trinity ...).

Also add the drm_legacy prefix for functions which are called from
common code. To further reduce the impact on common code also extract
all the ctx release handling into a function (instead of only
releasing individual handles) and make ctxbitmap_cleanup return void -
it can never fail.
