crypto: nx - saves chaining value from co-processor

This patch fixes a bug that is triggered when cts(cbc(aes)) is used with
nx-crypto driver on input larger than 32 bytes.

The chaining value from co-processor was not being saved. This value is
needed because it is used as the IV by cts(cbc(aes)).
