	Hmm, another OMAP serial patch that wasn't Cc'd to linux-omap
	where OMAP users might have seen it. :(

	I just bisected a strange problem in linux-next on OMAP3 down to
	this patch.  Reverting it fixes the problem.

	On OMAP3530 Beagle and Overo, after boot, doing a 'cat
	/proc/cpuinfo' was not returning to a prompt, suggesting
	something strange with the FIFO.  Hitting return gets me back to
	a prompt.

	Greg, this one should also be dropped from tty-next until it can
	be further investgated and the problem solved.
