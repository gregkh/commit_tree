perf report: Fix perf_session__delete removal

There's no point of having out_delete label with perf_session__delete
call within __cmd_report function, because it's called at the end of the
cmd_report function.

The speed up due to commenting out the perf_session__delete at the end
does not seem relevant anymore. Measured speedup for ~1GB data file with
222466 FORKS events is around 0.5%.

  $ perf report -i perf.data.delete -P perf_session__delete -s parent

  +  99.51%  [other]
  +   0.49%  perf_session__delete
