ipc/sem.c: update sem_otime for all operations

In commit 0a2b9d4c7967 ("ipc/sem.c: move wake_up_process out of the
spinlock section"), the update of semaphore's sem_otime(last semop time)
was moved to one central position (do_smart_update).

But since do_smart_update() is only called for operations that modify
the array, this means that wait-for-zero semops do not update sem_otime
anymore.

The fix is simple:
Non-alter operations must update sem_otime.
