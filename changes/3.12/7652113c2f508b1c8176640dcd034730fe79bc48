If the queue is dying then we only call the rq->end_io callout.
This leaves bios setup on the request, because the caller assumes when
the blk_execute_rq_nowait/blk_execute_rq call has completed that
the rq->bios have been cleaned up.

This patch has blk_execute_rq_nowait use __blk_end_request_all
to free bios and also call rq->end_io.
