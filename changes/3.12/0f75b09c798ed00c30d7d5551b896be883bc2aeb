af_packet: when sending ethernet frames, parse header for skb->protocol

This may be necessary when the SKB is passed to other layers on the go,
which check the protocol field on their own. An example is a VLAN packet
sent out using AF_PACKET on a bridge interface. The bridging code checks
the SKB size, accounting for any VLAN header only if the protocol field
is set accordingly.

Note that eth_type_trans() sets skb->dev to the passed argument, so this
can be skipped in packet_snd() for ethernet frames, as well.
