Revert "Btrfs: rework the overcommit logic to be based on the total size"

This reverts commit 70afa3998c9baed4186df38988246de1abdab56d.  It is causing
performance issues and wasn't actually correct.  There were problems with the
way we flushed delalloc and that was the real cause of the early enospc.
Thanks,
