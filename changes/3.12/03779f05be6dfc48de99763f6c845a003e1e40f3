usb: chipidea: move hw_phymode_configure() into probe

Currently hw_phymode_configure() is located inside hw_device_reset(), which is
only called by chipidea udc driver.

When operating in host mode, we also need to call hw_phymode_configure() in
order to properly configure the PHY mode, so move this function into probe.

After this change, USB Host1 port on mx53qsb board is functional.
