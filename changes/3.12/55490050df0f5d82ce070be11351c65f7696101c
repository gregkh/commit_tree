m68k/atari: ARAnyM - Always use physical addresses in NatFeat calls

Pointers passed to ARAnyM NatFeat calls should be physical addresses,
not virtual addresses. This worked before because on Atari, physical and
virtual kernel addresses are the same, as long as normal kernel memory
is concerned.

Correct the few remaining places where virtual addresses were used.
