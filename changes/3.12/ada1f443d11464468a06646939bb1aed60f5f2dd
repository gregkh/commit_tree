These local symbols are used only in this file.
Fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/tty/serial/sirfsoc_uart.c:147:6: warning: symbol 'sirfsoc_uart_start_tx' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/tty/serial/sirfsoc_uart.c:636:5: warning: symbol 'sirfsoc_uart_probe' was not declared. Should it be static?
