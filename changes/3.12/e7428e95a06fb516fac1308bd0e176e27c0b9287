virtio-net: put virtio net header inline with data

For small packets we can simplify xmit processing
by linearizing buffers with the header:
most packets seem to have enough head room
we can use for this purpose.
Since existing hypervisors require that header
is the first s/g element, we need a feature bit
for this.
