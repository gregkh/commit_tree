brcmfmac: no fws locking outside fws module.

FWS uses locking to protect its data while being called from
various entries. On bus_txdata the lock was kept resulting in
unnecessary long locking, but also creating possibility for
deadlock. This update changes the locking to release lock when
bus_txdata is called.
