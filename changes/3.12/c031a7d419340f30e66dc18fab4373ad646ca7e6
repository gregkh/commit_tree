usb: usb: dsps: update code according to the binding document

This relfects the code and dts requires changes due to recent .dts
binding updates:
- use mg prefix for the Metor Graphics specific attributes
- use power in mA not in mA/2 as specifed in the USB2.0 specification
- remove the child node for USB. This is driver specific on won't be
  reflected in the device tree
- use the "mentor" prefix instead of "mg".
- use "dr_mode" istead of "mg,port-mode" for the port mode. The former
  is used by a few other drivers.
