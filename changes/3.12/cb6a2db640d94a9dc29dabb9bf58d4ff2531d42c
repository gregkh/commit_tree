staging/lustre/llite: error of listxattr when buffer is small

According to the standard, listxattr(2) should return -1
and errno should be set to ERANGE if the size of the list
buffer is too small to hold the result. However ll_listxattr()
will return a value bigger than the size of buffer in some cases.

Let's assume listxattr(2) returns SIZE when it is called with a
large enough list buffer. If it's called again with a list buffer
whose size is smaller than SIZE but bigger than (SIZE - 12), then
listxattr(2) will return SIZE too. This patch fixes the problem.
