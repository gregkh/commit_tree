serial: ioc4_serial: Staticize ioc4_serial_attach_one()

ioc4_serial_attach_one() is used only in this file.
Also, ioc4_serial is not used; it can be removed.
Fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/tty/serial/ioc4_serial.c:300:3: warning: symbol 'ioc4_serial' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/tty/serial/ioc4_serial.c:2771:1: warning: symbol 'ioc4_serial_attach_one' was not declared. Should it be static?
