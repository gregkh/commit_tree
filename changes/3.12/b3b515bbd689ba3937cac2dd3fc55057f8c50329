pstore: Add new argument 'compressed' in pstore write callback

Addition of new argument 'compressed' in the write call back will
help the backend to know if the data passed from pstore is compressed
or not (In case where compression fails.). If compressed, the backend
can add a tag indicating the data is compressed while writing to
persistent store.
