e1000e: do not resume device from RPM suspend to read PHY status registers

When the device is runtime suspended (e.g. when there is no link), do not
wake it from D3 to read the PHY status; just set the values to typical
power-on defaults as is done when runtime PM is not enabled and there is no
link.
