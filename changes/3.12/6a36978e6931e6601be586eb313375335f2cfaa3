rpc: comment on linux_cred encoding, treat all as unsigned

The encoding of linux creds is a bit confusing.

Also: I think in practice it doesn't really matter whether we treat any
of these things as signed or unsigned, but unsigned seems more
straightforward: uid_t/gid_t are unsigned and it simplifies the ngroups
overflow check.
