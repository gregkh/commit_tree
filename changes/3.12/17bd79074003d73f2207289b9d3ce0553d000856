n_tty: Remove echo_lock

Adding data to echo_buf (via add_echo_byte()) is guaranteed to be
single-threaded, since all callers are from the n_tty_receive_buf()
path. Processing the echo_buf can be called from either the
n_tty_receive_buf() path or the n_tty_write() path; however, these
callers are already serialized by output_lock.

Publish cumulative echo_head changes to echo_commit; process echo_buf
from echo_tail to echo_commit; remove echo_lock.

On echo_buf overrun, claim output_lock to serialize changes to
echo_tail.
