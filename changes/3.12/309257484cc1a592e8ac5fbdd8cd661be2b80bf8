powerpc: Cleanup udbg_16550 and add support for LPC PIO-only UARTs

The udbg_16550 code, which we use for our early consoles and debug
backends was fairly messy. Especially for the debug consoles, it
would re-implement the "high level" getc/putc/poll functions for
each access method. It also had code to configure the UART but only
for the straight MMIO method.

This changes it to instead abstract at the register accessor level,
and have the various functions and configuration routines use these.

The result is simpler and slightly smaller code, and free support
for non-MMIO mapped PIO UARTs, which such as the ones that can be
present on a POWER 8 LPC bus.
