batman-adv: set up network coding packet handlers during module init

batman-adv saves its table of packet handlers as a global state, so handlers
must be set up only once (and setting them up a second time will fail).

The recently-added network coding support tries to set up its handler each time
a new softif is registered, which obviously fails when more that one softif is
used (and in consequence, the softif creation fails).

Fix this by splitting up batadv_nc_init into batadv_nc_init (which is called
only once) and batadv_nc_mesh_init (which is called for each softif); in
addition batadv_nc_free is renamed to batadv_nc_mesh_free to keep naming
consistent.
