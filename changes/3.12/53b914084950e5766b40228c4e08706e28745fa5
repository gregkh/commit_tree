drm/i915: Don't attempt to read an unitialized stack value

If intel_sdvo_get_value() fails here, val is unitialized and the cross
check will compare the pipe config multiplier with a bogus value.

Instead, only set encoder_pixel_multiplier when the sdvo command has
been successful. The cross check will compare the pipe config value with
0 otherwise.

v2: Do the cross check with the initial value of encoder_pixel_multiplier (0)
if the sdvo command fails (and thus keep the warning) (Daniel Vetter)
