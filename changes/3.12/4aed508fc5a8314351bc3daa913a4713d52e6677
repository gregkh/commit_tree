acpi-dma: fix sparse warning

This patch fixes sparse warning:
	drivers/dma/acpi-dma.c:76:21: sparse: cast to restricted __le32

Since everything in all ACPI tables is little-endian, by definition, the used
types in practice are uXX. Thus, we have to enforce __leXX if we want to
convert them to CPU order.
