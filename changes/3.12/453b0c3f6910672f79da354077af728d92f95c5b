mwifiex: fix SDIO interrupt lost issue

601216e "mwifiex: process RX packets in SDIO IRQ thread directly"
introduced a command timeout issue which can be reproduced easily on
an AM33xx platform using a test application written by Daniel Mack:

https://gist.github.com/zonque/6579314

mwifiex_main_process() is called from both the SDIO handler and
the workqueue. In case an interrupt occurs right after the
int_status check, but before updating the mwifiex_processing flag,
this interrupt gets lost, resulting in a command timeout and
consequently a card reset.

Let main_proc_lock protect both int_status and mwifiex_processing
flag. This fixes the interrupt lost issue.
