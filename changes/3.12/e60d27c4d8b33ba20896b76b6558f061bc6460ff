n_tty: Factor LNEXT processing from per-char i/o path

LNEXT processing accounts for ~15% of total cpu time in end-to-end
tty i/o; factor the lnext test/clear from the per-char i/o path.

Instead, attempt to immediately handle the literal next char if not
at the end of this received buffer; otherwise, handle the first char
of the next received buffer as the literal next char, then continue
with normal i/o.
