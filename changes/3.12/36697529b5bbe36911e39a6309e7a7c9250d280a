tty: Replace ldisc locking with ldisc_sem

Line discipline locking was performed with a combination of
a mutex, a status bit, a count, and a waitqueue -- basically,
a rw semaphore.

Replace the existing combination with an ld_semaphore.

Fixes:
 1) the 'reference acquire after ldisc locked' bug
 2) the over-complicated halt mechanism
 3) lock order wrt. tty_lock()
 4) dropping locks while changing ldisc
 5) previously unidentified deadlock while locking ldisc from
    both linked ttys concurrently
 6) previously unidentified recursive deadlocks

Adds much-needed lockdep diagnostics.
