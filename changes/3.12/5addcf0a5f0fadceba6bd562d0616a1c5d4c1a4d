nouveau: add runtime PM support (v0.9)

This hooks nouveau up to the runtime PM system to enable
dynamic power management for secondary GPUs in switchable
and optimus laptops.

a) rewrite suspend/resume printks to hide them during dynamic s/r
to avoid cluttering logs
b) add runtime pm suspend to irq handler, crtc display, ioctl handler,
connector status,
c) handle hdmi audio dynamic power on/off using magic register.

v0.5:
make sure we hit D3 properly
fix fbdev_set_suspend locking interaction, we only will poweroff if we have no
active crtcs/fbcon anyways.
add reference for active crtcs.
sprinkle mark last busy for autosuspend timeout

v0.6:
allow more flexible debugging - to avoid log spam
add option to enable/disable dynpm
got to D3Cold

v0.7:
add hdmi audio support.

v0.8:
call autosuspend from idle, so pci config space access doesn't go straight
back to sleep, this makes starting X faster.
only signal usage if we actually handle the irq, otherwise usb keeps us awake.
fix nv50 display active powerdown

v0.9:
use masking function to enable hdmi audio
set busy when we fail to suspend
