DMA: shdma: support the new CHCLR register layout

On newer r-car SoCs the CHCLR register only contains one bit per channel,
to which a 1 has to be written to reset the channel. Older SoC versions had
one CHCLR register per channel, to which a 0 must be written to reset the
channel and clear its buffers. This patch adds support for the newer
layout.
