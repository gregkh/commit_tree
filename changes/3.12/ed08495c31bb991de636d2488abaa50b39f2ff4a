tcp: use RTT from SACK for RTO

If RTT is not available because Karn's check has failed or no
new packet is acked, use the RTT measured from SACK to estimate
the RTO. The sender can continue to estimate the RTO during loss
recovery or reordering event upon receiving non-partial ACKs.

This also changes when the RTO is re-armed. Previously it is
only re-armed when some data is cummulatively acknowledged (i.e.,
SND.UNA advances), but now it is re-armed whenever RTT estimator
is updated. This feature is particularly useful to reduce spurious
timeout for buffer bloat including cellular carriers [1], and
RTT estimation on reordering events.
