xfs: ioctl check for capabilities in the current user namespace

Use inode_capable() to check if SUID|SGID bits should be cleared to match
similar check in inode_change_ok().

The check for CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE was not modified since all other file
systems also check against init_user_ns rather than current_user_ns.

Only allow changing of projid from init_user_ns.
