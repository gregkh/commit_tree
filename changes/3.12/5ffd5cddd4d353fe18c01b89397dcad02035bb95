net: netlink: filter particular protocols from analyzers

Fix finer-grained control and let only a whitelist of allowed netlink
protocols pass, in our case related to networking. If later on, other
subsystems decide they want to add their protocol as well to the list
of allowed protocols they shall simply add it. While at it, we also
need to tell what protocol is in use otherwise BPF_S_ANC_PROTOCOL can
not pick it up (as it's not filled out).
