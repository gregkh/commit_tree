ACPI: Export acpi_(bay)|(dock)_match() from scan.c

Functions acpi_dock_match() and acpi_bay_match() in scan.c can be
shared with dock.c to reduce code duplication, so export them as
global functions.

Also add a new function acpi_ata_match() to check whether an ACPI
device object represents an ATA device.
