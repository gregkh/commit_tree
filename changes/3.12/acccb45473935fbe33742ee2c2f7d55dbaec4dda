staging: dgap: tty.c: fixes ioctl param list

The declaration for the ioctl function has changed. The previous version
of this declaration took struct file *file as a parameter and the new
one does not. This patch removes that parameter.

It also removes cases for the commands TIOCGETP
TCGETS and TCGETA.
