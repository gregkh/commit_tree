drm/i915: Disable specific watermark levels when latency is zero

Return UINT_MAX for the calculated WM level if the latency is zero.
This will lead to marking the WM level as disabled.

I'm not sure if latency==0 should mean that we want to disable the
level. But that's the implication I got from the fact that we don't
even enable the watermark code of the SSKDP register is 0.
