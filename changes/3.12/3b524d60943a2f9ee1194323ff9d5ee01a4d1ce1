sched/Documentation: Update sched-design-CFS.txt documentation

2bd2d6f2dc ("sched: Replace use of entity_key()") had remove the
entity_key() which function is to subtract a tasks vruntime by
its groups minvruntime as the rbtree key.
The phrase "there is a subtraction using rq->cfs.min_vruntime
to account for possible wraparounds" in documentation feels strange
and meaningless. So remove it.
