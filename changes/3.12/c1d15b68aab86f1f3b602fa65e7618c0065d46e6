i2c: mv64xxx: Fix timing issue on Armada XP (errata FE-8471889)

All the Armada XP (mv78230, mv78260 and mv78460) have a silicon issue
in the I2C controller which violate the i2c repeated start
timing. The I2C standard requires a minimum of 4.7us for the repeated
start condition whereas the I2C controller of the Armada XP this time
is 2.9us.

So this patch adds a 5us delay for the start case only if the
the compatible i2c-mv78230 is set.

Based on the initals patches from Zbigniew Bodek
