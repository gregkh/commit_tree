ARM: tegra: add a flag for tegra_disable_clean_inv_dcache to do LoUIS or ALL

Adding a flag for tegra_disable_clean_inv_dcache to flush cache as LoUIS
or ALL. After this patch, the v7_flush_dcache_louis is used for CPU hotplug
and CPU suspend in CPU power down (e.g. CPU idle power-down mode) case. And
the v7_flush_dcache_all is used for CPU cluster power down (e.g. suspend to
LP2 mode).
