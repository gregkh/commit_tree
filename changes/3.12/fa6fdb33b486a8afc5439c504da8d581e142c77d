driver core: bus_type: add dev_groups

attribute groups are much more flexible than just a list of attributes,
due to their support for visibility of the attributes, and binary
attributes. Add dev_groups to struct bus_type which should be used
instead of dev_attrs.

dev_attrs will be removed from the structure soon.
