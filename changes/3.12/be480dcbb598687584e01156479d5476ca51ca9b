dma: dw: append MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE for ACPI case

In rare cases (mostly for the testing purposes) the dw_dmac driver might be
compiled as a module as well as the other LPSS device drivers (I2C, SPI,
HSUART). When udev handles the event of the devices appearing the dw_dmac
module is missing. This patch will fix that.
