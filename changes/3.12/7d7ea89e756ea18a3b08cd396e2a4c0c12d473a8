ext4: refactor code to read the extent tree block

Refactor out the code needed to read the extent tree block into a
single read_extent_tree_block() function.  In addition to simplifying
the code, it also makes sure that we call the ext4_ext_load_extent
tracepoint whenever we need to read an extent tree block from disk.
