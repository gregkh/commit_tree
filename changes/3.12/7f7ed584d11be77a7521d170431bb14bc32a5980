clk: get matching entry under lock in of_clk_init()

Currently of_clk_init() finds a matching device node while holding
the device tree spinlock.  When a matching device node is found, the
lock is dropped and then re-acquired in order to get a reference
to the matching device id structure.

Acquiring the spinlock twice is unnecessary (and it opens a
vulnerable window that could conceivably lead to errors).

There already exists an interface for both finding and taking a
reference to a device id under lock, so use it.
