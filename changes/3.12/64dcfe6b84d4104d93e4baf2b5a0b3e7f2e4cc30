staging: android: binder: fix binder interface for 64bit compat layer

The changes in this patch will fix the binder interface for use on 64bit
machines and stand as the base of the 64bit compat support. The changes
apply to the structures that are passed between the kernel and
userspace.

Most of the  changes applied mirror the change to struct binder_version
where there is no need for a 64bit wide protocol_version(on 64bit
machines). The change inlines with the existing 32bit userspace(the
structure has the same size) and simplifies the compat layer such that
the same handler can service the BINDER_VERSION ioctl.

Other changes make use of kernel types as well as user-exportable ones
and fix format specifier issues.

The changes do not affect existing 32bit ABI.
