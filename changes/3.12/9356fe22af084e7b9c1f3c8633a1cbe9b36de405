xfs: make struct xfs_perag kernel only

The struct xfs_perag has many kernel-only definitions in it,
requiring a __KERNEL__ guard so userspace can use it to. Move it to
xfs_mount.h so that it it kernel-only, and let userspace redefine
it's own version of the structure containing only what it needs.
This gets rid of another __KERNEL__ check in the XFS header files.
