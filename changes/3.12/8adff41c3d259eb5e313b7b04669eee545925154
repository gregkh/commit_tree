bridge: Don't use VID 0 and 4095 in vlan filtering

IEEE 802.1Q says that:
- VID 0 shall not be configured as a PVID, or configured in any Filtering
Database entry.
- VID 4095 shall not be configured as a PVID, or transmitted in a tag
header. This VID value may be used to indicate a wildcard match for the VID
in management operations or Filtering Database entries.
(See IEEE 802.1Q-2011 6.9.1 and Table 9-2)

Don't accept adding these VIDs in the vlan_filtering implementation.
