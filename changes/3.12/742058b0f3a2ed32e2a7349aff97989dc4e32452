apparmor: rework namespace free path

namespaces now completely use the unconfined profile to track the
refcount and rcu freeing cycle. So rework the code to simplify (track
everything through the profile path right up to the end), and move the
rcu_head from policy base to profile as the namespace no longer needs
it.
