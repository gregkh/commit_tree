vxlan: Fix sparse warnings

This patch fixes sparse warnings when incorrectly handling the port number
and using int instead of unsigned int iterating through &vn->sock_list[].
Keeping the port as __be16 also makes things clearer wrt endianess.
Also, it was pointed out that vxlan_get_rx_port() had unnecessary checks
which got removed.
