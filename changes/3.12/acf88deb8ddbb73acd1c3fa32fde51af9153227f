drm/radeon: fix resume on some rs4xx boards (v2)

Setting MC_MISC_CNTL.GART_INDEX_REG_EN causes hangs on
some boards on resume.  The systems seem to work fine
without touching this bit so leave it as is.

v2: read-modify-write the GART_INDEX_REG_EN bit.
I suspect the problem is that we are losing the other
settings in the register.
