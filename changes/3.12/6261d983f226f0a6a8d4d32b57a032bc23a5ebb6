ip_tunnel: embed hash list head

The IP tunnel hash heads can be embedded in the per-net structure
since it is a fixed size. Reduce the size so that the total structure
fits in a page size. The original size was overly large, even NETDEV_HASHBITS
is only 8 bits!

Also, add some white space for readability.
