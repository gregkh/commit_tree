GFS2: Don't flag consistency error if first mounter is a spectator

This patch checks for the first mounter being a specator. If so, it
makes sure all the journals are clean. If there's a dirty journal,
the mount fails.

Testing results:

# insmod gfs2.ko
# mount -tgfs2 -o spectator /dev/sasdrives/scratch /mnt/gfs2
mount: permission denied
# dmesg | tail -2
[ 3390.655996] GFS2: fsid=MUSKETEER:home: Now mounting FS...
[ 3390.841336] GFS2: fsid=MUSKETEER:home.s: jid=0: Journal is dirty, so the first mounter must not be a spectator.
# mount -tgfs2 /dev/sasdrives/scratch /mnt/gfs2
# umount /mnt/gfs2
# mount -tgfs2 -o spectator /dev/sasdrives/scratch /mnt/gfs2
# ls /mnt/gfs2|wc -l
352
# umount /mnt/gfs2
