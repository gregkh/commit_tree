rcu: Simplify debug-objects fixups

The current debug-objects fixups are complex and heavyweight, and the
fixups are not complete:  Even with the fixups, RCU's callback lists
can still be corrupted.  This commit therefore strips the fixups down
to their minimal form, eliminating two of the three.

It would be even better if (for example) call_rcu() simply leaked
any problematic callbacks, but for that to happen, the debug-objects
system would need to inform its caller of suspicious situations.
This is the subject of a later commit in this series.
