md: fix safe_mode buglet.

Whe we set the safe_mode_timeout to a smaller value we trigger a timeout
immediately - otherwise the small value might not be honoured.
However if the previous timeout was 0 meaning "no timeout", we didn't.
This would mean that no timeout happens until the next write completes,
which could be a long time.
