memcg, vmscan: do not fall into reclaim-all pass too quickly

shrink_zone starts with soft reclaim pass first and then falls back to
regular reclaim if nothing has been scanned.  This behavior is natural
but there is a catch.  Memcg iterators, when used with the reclaim
cookie, are designed to help to prevent from over reclaim by
interleaving reclaimers (per node-zone-priority) so the tree walk might
miss many (even all) nodes in the hierarchy e.g.  when there are direct
reclaimers racing with each other or with kswapd in the global case or
multiple allocators reaching the limit for the target reclaim case.  To
make it even more complicated, targeted reclaim doesn't do the whole
tree walk because it stops reclaiming once it reclaims sufficient pages.
As a result groups over the limit might be missed, thus nothing is
scanned, and reclaim would fall back to the reclaim all mode.

This patch checks for the incomplete tree walk in shrink_zone.  If no
group has been visited and the hierarchy is soft reclaimable then we
must have missed some groups, in which case the __shrink_zone is called
again.  This doesn't guarantee there will be some progress of course
because the current reclaimer might be still racing with others but it
would at least give a chance to start the walk without a big risk of
reclaim latencies.
