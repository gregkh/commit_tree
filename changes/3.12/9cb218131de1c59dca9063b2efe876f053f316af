vmcore: introduce remap_oldmem_pfn_range()

For zfcpdump we can't map the HSA storage because it is only available via
a read interface.  Therefore, for the new vmcore mmap feature we have
introduce a new mechanism to create mappings on demand.

This patch introduces a new architecture function remap_oldmem_pfn_range()
that should be used to create mappings with remap_pfn_range() for oldmem
areas that can be directly mapped.  For zfcpdump this is everything
besides of the HSA memory.  For the areas that are not mapped by
remap_oldmem_pfn_range() a generic vmcore a new generic vmcore fault
handler mmap_vmcore_fault() is called.

This handler works as follows:

* Get already available or new page from page cache (find_or_create_page)
* Check if /proc/vmcore page is filled with data (PageUptodate)
* If yes:
  Return that page
* If no:
  Fill page using __vmcore_read(), set PageUptodate, and return page
