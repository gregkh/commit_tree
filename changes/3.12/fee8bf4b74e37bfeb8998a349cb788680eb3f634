pci_ids.h: remove PCI_VENDOR_ID_ADDIDATA_OLD and PCI_DEVICE_ID_ADDIDATA_APCI7800

These two defines are no longer used.  They were only used by the PCI
serial driver "8250_pci" to support the original ADDI-DATA APCI-7800
card.  In that driver, PCI_VENDOR_ID_ADDIDATA_OLD has been replaced with
PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMCC which has the same value (0x10e8), and
PCI_DEVICE_ID_ADDIDATA_APCI7800 has been replaced with a local #define
PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMCC_ADDIDATA_APCI7800 with the same value (0x818e).
