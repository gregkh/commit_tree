[media] Fixed misleading error when handling IR interrupts

Hi,
Handling the AV Core/IR interrupts schedules its workqueue but
the schedule_work function returns false if @work was already on the
kernel-global workqueue and true otherwise.
Printing an error message if @work wasn't in the queue is wrong.
Regards,
Luis
