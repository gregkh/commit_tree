net: add a temporary sanity check in skb_orphan()

David suggested to add a BUG_ON() to catch if some layer
sets skb->sk pointer without a corresponding destructor.

As skb can sit in a queue, it's mandatory to make sure the
socket cannot disappear, and it's usually done by taking a
reference on the socket, then releasing it from the skb
destructor.

This patch is a follow-up to commit c34a761231b5
("net: skb_orphan() changes") and will be reverted after
catching all possible offenders if any.
