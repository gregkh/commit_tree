PCI: Differentiate ACS controllable from enabled

We currently misinterpret that in order for an ACS feature to be
enabled it must be set in the control field.  In reality, this means
that the feature is not only enabled, but controllable.  Many of the
ACS capability bits are not required if the device behaves by default
in the way specified when both the capability and control bit are set
and does not support or allow the alternate mode.  We therefore need
to check the capabilities and mask out flags that are enabled but not
controllable.  Egress control seems to be the only flag which is
purely optional.
