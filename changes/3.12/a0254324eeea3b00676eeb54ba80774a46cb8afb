xhci: add trace for debug messages related to endpoint reset

This patch defines a new trace event, which is called xhci_dbg_reset_ep
and belongs in the event class xhci_log_msg, and adds tracepoints that
trace the debug messages associated with resetting an endpoint after
the reception of a STALL packet.
