um: Cleanup SIGTERM handling

Richard reported that some UML processes survive if the UML
main process receives a SIGTERM.
This issue was caused by a wrongly placed signal(SIGTERM, SIG_DFL)
in init_new_thread_signals().
It disabled the UML exit handler accidently for some processes.
The correct solution is to disable the fatal handler for all
UML helper threads/processes.
Such that last_ditch_exit() does not get called multiple times
and all processes can exit due to SIGTERM.
