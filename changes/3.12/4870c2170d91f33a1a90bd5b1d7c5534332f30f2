spi: spi-ep93xx: always handle transfer specific settings

__spi_async(), which starts every SPI message transfer, initializes
the bits_per_word and max speed for every transfer in the message.
Since the conditional test in ep93xx_spi_process_transfer() will
always succeed just remove it and always call ep93xx_spi_chip_setup()
to configure the hardware for each transfer in the message.

Remove the redundant ep93xx_spi_chp_setup() in ep93xx_spi_process_transfer()
which just initializes the hardware to the "default" based on the SPI
device.
