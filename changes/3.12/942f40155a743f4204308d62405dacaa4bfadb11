PM / hibernate / memory hotplug: Rework mutual exclusion

Since all of the memory hotplug operations have to be carried out
under device_hotplug_lock, they won't need to acquire pm_mutex if
device_hotplug_lock is held around hibernation.

For this reason, make the hibernation code acquire
device_hotplug_lock after freezing user space processes and
release it before thawing them.  At the same tim drop the
lock_system_sleep() and unlock_system_sleep() calls from
lock_memory_hotplug() and unlock_memory_hotplug(), respectively.
