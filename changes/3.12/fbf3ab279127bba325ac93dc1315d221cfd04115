serial: tegra: use NULL instead of 0

'cons' is a pointer; thus NULL should be used instead of 0.
Also, local symbols are staticized.
Fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/tty/serial/serial-tegra.c:1209:27: warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer
drivers/tty/serial/serial-tegra.c:1240:29: warning: symbol 'tegra20_uart_chip_data' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/tty/serial/serial-tegra.c:1246:29: warning: symbol 'tegra30_uart_chip_data' was not declared. Should it be static?
