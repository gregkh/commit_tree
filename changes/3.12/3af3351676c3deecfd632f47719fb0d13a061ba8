memcg: avoid overflow caused by PAGE_ALIGN

Since PAGE_ALIGN is aligning up(the next page boundary), so after
PAGE_ALIGN, the value might be overflow, such as write the MAX value to
*.limit_in_bytes.

  $ cat /cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes
  18446744073709551615

  # echo 18446744073709551615 > /cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes
  bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

Some user programs might depend on such behaviours(like libcg, we read
the value in snapshot, then use the value to reset cgroup later), and
that will cause confusion.  So we need to fix it.
