ALSA: us122l: Fix pcm_usb_stream mmapping regression

The pcm_usb_stream plugin requires the mremap explicitly for the read
buffer, as it expands itself once after reading the required size.
But the commit [314e51b9: mm: kill vma flag VM_RESERVED and
mm->reserved_vm counter] converted blindly to a combination of
VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP like other normal drivers, and this
resulted in the failure of mremap().

For fixing this regression, we need to remove VM_DONTEXPAND for the
read-buffer mmap.
