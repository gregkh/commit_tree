perf/x86/intel: Mark MEM_LOAD_UOPS_MISS_RETIRED as precise on SNB

On Intel SNB (SNB, SNB-EP), the event MEM_LOAD_UOPS_MISS_RETIRED
supports PEBS. It was missing for the SNB PEBS event constraint
table thereby preventing any measurement with PEBS for it.

This patch adds the event to the PEBS table for SNB.

WARNING: it should be noted that this event like a few others
are subject to the erratum BT241 for Xeon E5 (SNB-EP). As such,
the event may undercount when used with PEBS unless the
workaround is implemented. But without this patch and just the
workaround, the kernel would not allow precise sampling on this
event. BT241 is documented in:
