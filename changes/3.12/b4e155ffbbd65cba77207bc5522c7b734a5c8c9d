IB/iser: Generalize rdma memory registration

Currently the driver uses FMRs as the only means to register the
memory pointed by SG provided by the SCSI mid-layer with the RDMA
device.

As preparation step for adding more methods for fast path memory
registration, make the alloc/free and reg/unreg calls function
pointers, which are for now just set to the existing FMR ones.
