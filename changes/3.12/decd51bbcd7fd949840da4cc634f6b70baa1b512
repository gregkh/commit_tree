cpuidle: Add a comment warning about possible overflow

The menu governor has a number of tunable constants that may be changed
in the source. If certain combination of values are chosen, an overflow
is possible when the correction_factor is being recalculated.

This patch adds a warning regarding this possibility and describes the
change needed for fixing the issue. The change should not be permanently
enabled, as it will hurt performance when it is not needed.
