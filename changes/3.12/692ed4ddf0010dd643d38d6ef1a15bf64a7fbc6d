Revert "usb: pl2303: move the two baud rate encoding methods to separate functions"

This reverts commit e917ba01d69ad705a4cd6a6c77538f55d84f5907.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
