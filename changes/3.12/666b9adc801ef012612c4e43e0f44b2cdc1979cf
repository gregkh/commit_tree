Drivers: hv: vmbus: Do not attempt to negoatiate a new version prematurely

The current code would attempt to negotiate a different protocol version if
the current negotiation timed out. This triggers an assert in the host (on debug
builds). Avoid this by negotiating a newer version only if the host properly
rejects the current version being negotiated.
