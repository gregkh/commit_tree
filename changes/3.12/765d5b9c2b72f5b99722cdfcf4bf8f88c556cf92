fbdev: fbcon: select VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING

fbdev provides framebuffer hotplugging, hence, we need to allow fbcon to
unbind from framebuffers. Unfortunately, fbcon_fb_unbind() cannot unbind
from the last framebuffer, unless console-unbinding is supported.

Fixing fbcon_unbind() to return 0 caused some horrible NULL-derefs in the
VT layer and I couldn't figure out why. Hence, lets just require
console-unbinding so fbdev hotplugging works with fbcon.
