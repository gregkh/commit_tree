ceph: trivial buildbot warnings fix

The linux-next build bot found a three of warnings, this addresses all of them.

 * non-ANSI function declaration of function 'ceph_fscache_register' and
   'ceph_fscache_unregister'
 * symbol 'ceph_cache_netfs' was not declared, now it's extern in the header.
 * warning: "pr_fmt" redefined
