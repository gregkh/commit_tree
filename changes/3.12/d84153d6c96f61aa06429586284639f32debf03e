perf: Implement finer grained full dynticks kick

Currently the full dynticks subsystem keep the
tick alive as long as there are perf events running.

This prevents the tick from being stopped as long as features
such that the lockup detectors are running. As a temporary fix,
the lockup detector is disabled by default when full dynticks
is built but this is not a long term viable solution.

To fix this, only keep the tick alive when an event configured
with a frequency rather than a period is running on the CPU,
or when an event throttles on the CPU.

These are the only purposes of the perf tick, especially now that
the rotation of flexible events is handled from a seperate hrtimer.
The tick can be shutdown the rest of the time.
