staging: comedi: pcmmio: remove unneeded checks on detach

As pointed out by Dan carpenter for the similar pcmuio driver, there is
no need to check the pointer passed to `kfree()`, so remove that check
from `pcmmio_detach()`.

Also, check the `devpriv` (`dev->private`) pointer once, outside the
`for` loop.
