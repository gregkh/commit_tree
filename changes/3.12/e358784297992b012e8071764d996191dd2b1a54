can: flexcan: fix mx28 detection by rearanging OF match table

The current implemetation of of_match_device() relies that the of_device_id
table in the driver is sorted from most specific to least specific compatible.

Without this patch the mx28 is detected as the less specific p1010. This leads
to a p1010 specific workaround is activated on the mx28, which is not needed.
