vfs: call d_op->d_prune() before unhashing dentry

The d_prune dentry operation is used to notify filesystem when VFS
about to prune a hashed dentry from the dcache. There are three
code paths that prune dentries: shrink_dcache_for_umount_subtree(),
prune_dcache_sb() and d_prune_aliases(). For the d_prune_aliases()
case, VFS unhashes the dentry first, then call the d_prune dentry
operation. This confuses ceph_d_prune() (ceph uses the d_prune
dentry operation to maintain a flag indicating whether the complete
contents of a directory are in the dcache, pruning unhashed dentry
does not affect dir's completeness)

This patch fixes the issue by calling the d_prune dentry operation
in d_prune_aliases(), before unhashing the dentry. Also make VFS
only call the d_prune dentry operation for hashed dentry, to avoid
calling the d_prune dentry operation twice when dentry is pruned
by d_prune_aliases().
