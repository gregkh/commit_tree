perf: Add a dummy software event to keep tracking

When an event is disabled the "tracking" events selected by the 'mmap',
'comm' and 'task' bits of struct perf_event_attr, are also disabled.
However, the information those events provide is necessary to resolve
symbols for when the main event is re-enabled.

The "tracking" events can be kept enabled by putting them on another
event, but that requires an event that otherwise does nothing.  A new
software event PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY is added for that purpose.
