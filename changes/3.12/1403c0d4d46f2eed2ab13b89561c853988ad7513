drm/i915: merge HSW and SNB PM irq handlers

Because hsw_pm_irq_handler does exactly what gen6_rps_irq_handler does
and also processes the 2 additional VEBOX bits. So merge those
functions and wrap the VEBOX bits on a HAS_VEBOX check. This
check isn't really necessary since the bits are reserved on
SNB/IVB/VLV, but it's a good documentation on who uses them.

v2: - Change IS_HASWELL check to HAS_VEBOX
