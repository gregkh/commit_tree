USB: Maintainers change for usb serial drivers

Johan has been conned^Wgracious in accepting the maintainership of the
USB serial drivers, especially as he's been doing all of the real work
for the past few years.

At the same time, remove a bunch of old entries for USB serial drivers
that don't make sense anymore, given that the developers are no longer
around, and individual driver maintainerships for tiny things like this
is pretty pointless.
