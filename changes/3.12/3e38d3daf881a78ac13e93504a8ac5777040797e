rt2x00: rt2800lib: introduce local EEPROM access functions

The patch adds rt2800 specific functions for
EEPROM data access and changes the code to use
these instead of the generic rt2x00_eeprom_*
variants.

To avoid functional changes, the new functions
are wrappers around the corresponding generic
rt2x00_eeprom_* routines for now. Functional
changes will be implemented in additional patches.
