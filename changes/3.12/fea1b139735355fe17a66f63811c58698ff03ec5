aoe: do not BUG if memory pressure prevented debugfs file creation

If the system has trouble allocating memory for the creation of the aoe
debugfs directory or of a file inside it, the debugfs member of an aoedev
can be NULL.

Do not treat a NULL debugfs pointer as a BUG on aoedev shutdown, avoiding
the user impact of an unecessary panic.
