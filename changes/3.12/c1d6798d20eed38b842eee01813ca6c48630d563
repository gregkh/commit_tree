drm: use common drm_gem_dmabuf_release in i915/exynos drivers

Note that this is slightly tricky since both drivers store their
native objects in dma_buf->priv. But both also embed the base
drm_gem_object at the first position, so the implicit cast is ok.

To use the release helper we need to export it, too.
