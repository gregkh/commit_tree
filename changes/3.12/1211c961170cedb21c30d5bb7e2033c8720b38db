mwifiex: do not create AP and P2P interfaces upon driver loading

Bug 60747 - 1286:2044 [Microsoft Surface Pro]
    Marvell 88W8797 wifi show 3 interface under network
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60747

This issue was also reported previously by OLPC and some folks from
the community.

There are 3 network interfaces with different types being created
when mwifiex driver is loaded:

1. mlan0 (infra. STA)
2. uap0 (AP)
3. p2p0 (P2P_CLIENT)

The Network Manager attempts to use all 3 interfaces above without
filtering the managed interface type. As the result, 3 identical
interfaces are displayed under network manager. If user happens to
click on an entry under which its interface is uap0 or p2p0, the
association will fail.

Work around it by removing the creation of AP and P2P interfaces
at driver loading time. These interfaces can be added with 'iw' or
other applications manually when they are needed.
