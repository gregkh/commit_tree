f2fs: fix a build failure due to missing the kobject header

This patch should resolve the following error reported by kbuild test robot.

All error/warnings:

   In file included from fs/f2fs/dir.c:13:0:
   >> fs/f2fs/f2fs.h:435:17: error: field 's_kobj' has incomplete type
        struct kobject s_kobj;

The failure was caused by missing the kobject header file in dir.c.
So, this patch move the header file to the right location, f2fs.h.
