6lowpan: introduce lowpan_fetch_skb function

This patch adds a helper function to parse the ipv6 header to a
6lowpan header in stream.

This function checks first if we can pull data with a specific
length from a skb. If this seems to be okay, we copy skb data to
a destination pointer and run skb_pull.
