nEPT: MMU context for nested EPT

KVM's existing shadow MMU code already supports nested TDP. To use it, we
need to set up a new "MMU context" for nested EPT, and create a few callbacks
for it (nested_ept_*()). This context should also use the EPT versions of
the page table access functions (defined in the previous patch).
Then, we need to switch back and forth between this nested context and the
regular MMU context when switching between L1 and L2 (when L1 runs this L2
with EPT).
