staging: vt6656: rxtx.c s_vFillTxKey fill structure vnt_mic_hdr

Replace the pointer offsets with structure of mic_hdr with
endian conversion where needed.

Replace vFillTxKey argument u8 *pMICHDR with struct vnt_mic_hdr *mic_hdr
and fix type of calling functions.

An extra check that mic_hdr is not NULL
