ext4: cache all of an extent tree's leaf block upon reading

When we read in an extent tree leaf block from disk, arrange to have
all of its entries cached.  In nearly all cases the in-memory
representation will be more compact than the on-disk representation in
the buffer cache, and it allows us to get the information without
having to traverse the extent tree for successive extents.
