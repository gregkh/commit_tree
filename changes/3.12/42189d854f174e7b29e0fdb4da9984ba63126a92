usb: clamp bInterval to allowed range

bInterval must be within the range 1 - 16
when running at High/Super speed, and within
the range 1 - 255 when running at Full/Low speed.

In order to catch drivers passing a too
large bInterval on Super/High speed scenarios
(thus overflowing urb->interval), let's clamp()
the argument to the allowed ranges.
