bnx2x, cnic, bnx2i, bnx2fc: Fix bnx2i and bnx2fc regressions.

commit b9871bcfd211d316adee317608dab44c58d6ea2d
    bnx2x: VF RSS support - PF side

changed the configuration of the doorbell HW and it broke iSCSI and FCoE.
We fix this by making compatible changes to the doorbell address in bnx2i
and bnx2fc.  For the userspace driver, we need to pass a modified CID
so that the existing userspace driver will calculate the correct doorbell
address and continue to work.
