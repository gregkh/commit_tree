MIPS: Add driver for the built-in PCI controller of the RT3883 SoC

The Ralink RT3883 SoCs have a built-in PCI Host Controller
device. The patch adds a platform driver and device tree
binding documentation for that.

The patch also enables the HW_HAS_PCI config option. This
is required in order to be able to enable the PCI support.
