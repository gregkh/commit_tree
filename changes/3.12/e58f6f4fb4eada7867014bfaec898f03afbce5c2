powerpc/83xx: gianfar_ptp: select 1588 clock source through dts file

Currently IEEE 1588 timer reference clock source is determined through
hard-coded value in gianfar_ptp driver. This patch allows to select ptp
clock source by means of device tree file node.

For instance:

	fsl,cksel = <0>;

for using external (TSEC_TMR_CLK input) high precision timer
reference clock.

Other acceptable values:

	<1> : eTSEC system clock
	<2> : eTSEC1 transmit clock
	<3> : RTC clock input

When this attribute isn't used, eTSEC system clock will serve as
IEEE 1588 timer reference clock.
