Revert "pl2303: simplify the else-if contruct for type_1 chips in pl2303_startup()"

This reverts commit 73b583af597542329e6adae44524da6f27afed62.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
