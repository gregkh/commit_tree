clk: move some parent related functions upwards

Move some parent related functions up in clk.c so they can be used by
the modifications in the following patch which enables clock reparenting
during set_rate. No other changes are made so this patch makes no
functional difference in isolation. This is separate from the following
patch primarily to ease readability of that patch.
