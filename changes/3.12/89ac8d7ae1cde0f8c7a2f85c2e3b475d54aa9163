clk: handle NULL struct clk gracefully

At some point changes to clk_set_rate and clk_set_parent introduced a
bug whereby NULL struct clk pointers were treated as an error. This is
in violation of the API in include/linux/clk.h. Reintroduce graceful
handling of NULL clk's by bailing from clk_set_rate and clk_set_parent
with return codes of zero.
