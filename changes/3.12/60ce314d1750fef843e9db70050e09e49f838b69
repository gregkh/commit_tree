rtlwifi: Align private space in rtl_priv struct

The private array at the end of the rtl_priv struct is not aligned.
On ARM architecture, this causes an alignment trap and is fixed by aligning
that array with __align(sizeof(void *)). That should properly align that
space according to the requirements of all architectures.
