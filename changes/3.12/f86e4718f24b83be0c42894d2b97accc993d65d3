driver/core: cpu: initialize of_node in cpu's device struture

CPUs are also registered as devices but the of_node in these cpu
devices are not initialized. Currently different drivers requiring
to access cpu device node are parsing the nodes themselves and
initialising the of_node in cpu device.

The of_node in all the cpu devices needs to be initialized properly
and at one place. The best place to update this is CPU subsystem
driver when registering the cpu devices.

The OF/DT core library now provides of_get_cpu_node to retrieve a cpu
device node for a given logical index by abstracting the architecture
specific details.

This patch uses of_get_cpu_node to assign of_node when registering the
cpu devices.
