usb: s3c-hsotg: do not disconnect gadget when receiving ErlySusp intr

DWC2 databook indicates if the core sets "ErlySusp" bit, an idle state has been
detected on the USB for 3 ms. This situation can be occurred when waiting
a request from user daemon. So, we should keep the connection between udc and
gadget even though this interrupt is occurred.
