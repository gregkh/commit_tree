drm/gem: create drm_gem_dumb_destroy

All the gem based kms drivers really want the same function to
destroy a dumb framebuffer backing storage object.

So give it to them and roll it out in all drivers.

This still leaves the option open for kms drivers which don't use GEM
for backing storage, but it does decently simplify matters for gem
drivers.
