tile PCI RC: add dma_get_required_mask()

The standard kernel function dma_get_required_mask() uses the
highest DRAM address to determine if 32-bit or 64-bit DMA addressing
is needed.  This only works on architectures that have direct mapping
between the PA and the PCI address space, i.e. those that don't have
I/O TLBs or have I/O TLB but choose to use direct mapping.  Neither
of these are true for tilegx.  Whether to use 64-bit DMA should depend
on the PCI device's capability only, not on the amount of DRAM
installeds, so we now advertise a 64-bit DMA mask unconditionally.
