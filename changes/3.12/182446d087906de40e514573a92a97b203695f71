cgroup: pass around cgroup_subsys_state instead of cgroup in file methods

cgroup is currently in the process of transitioning to using struct
cgroup_subsys_state * as the primary handle instead of struct cgroup.
Please see the previous commit which converts the subsystem methods
for rationale.

This patch converts all cftype file operations to take @css instead of
@cgroup.  cftypes for the cgroup core files don't have their subsytem
pointer set.  These will automatically use the dummy_css added by the
previous patch and can be converted the same way.

Most subsystem conversions are straight forwards but there are some
interesting ones.

* freezer: update_if_frozen() is also converted to take @css instead
  of @cgroup for consistency.  This will make the code look simpler
  too once iterators are converted to use css.

* memory/vmpressure: mem_cgroup_from_css() needs to be exported to
  vmpressure while mem_cgroup_from_cont() can be made static.
  Updated accordingly.

* cpu: cgroup_tg() doesn't have any user left.  Removed.

* cpuacct: cgroup_ca() doesn't have any user left.  Removed.

* hugetlb: hugetlb_cgroup_form_cgroup() doesn't have any user left.
  Removed.

* net_cls: cgrp_cls_state() doesn't have any user left.  Removed.
