i2c: designware: 10-bit addressing mode enabling if I2C_DYNAMIC_TAR_UPDATE is set

According to Designware I2C spec, if I2C_DYNAMIC_TAR_UPDATE is set to 1,
the 10-bit addressing mode is controlled by IC_10BITADDR_MASTER bit of
IC_TAR register instead of IC_CON register. The IC_10BITADDR_MASTER
in IC_CON register becomes read-only copy. Since I2C_DYNAMIC_TAR_UPDATE
value can't be detected from hardware register, so we will always set the
IC_10BITADDR_MASTER bit in both IC_CON and IC_TAR register whenever 10-bit
addresing mode is requested by user application.
