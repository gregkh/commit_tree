ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Allow slots without new devices to be rescanned

Currently, enable_device() checks the return value of pci_scan_slot()
and returns immediately if that's 0 (meaning that no new functions
have been found in the slot).  However, if one of the functions in
the slot is a bridge, some new devices may appear below it even if
the bridge itself is present continuously, so it generally is
necessary to do the rescan anyway just in case.  [In particular,
that's necessary with the Thunderbolt daisy chaining in which case
new devices may be connected to the existing ones down the chain.]

The correctness of this change relies on the ability of
pcibios_resource_survey_bus() to detect if it has already been called
for the given bus and to skip it if so.  Failure to do that will lead
to resource allocation conflicts.
