firmware/dmi_scan: drop OOM messages

As reported by Joe Perches: OOM messages generally aren't useful.
dmi_alloc is either a trivial front-end to kzalloc, and kzalloc already
does a dump_stack() when OOM, or for x86, dmi_alloc uses extend_brk
which BUGs when unsuccessful.

So we can remove all 6 such log messages in the dmi_scan driver, to
shrink the binary size (by 528 bytes on x86_64.)
