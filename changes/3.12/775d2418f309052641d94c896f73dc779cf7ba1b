ARM: dts: Fix muxing and regulator for wl12xx on the SDIO bus for blaze

Commit 76787b3b (ARM: OMAP2+: Remove board-4430sdp.c)
removed legacy booting in favor of device tree based booting
for 4430sdp. That caused the WLAN to stop working as the
related .dts entries fell through the cracks.

I don't have the "1283 PG 2.21 connectivity device" on my 4430sdp,
but the earlier version of this patch was tested by Luciano
Coelho. This version has left out the input logic for MMC CLK
line compared to the earlier version as that is not bidirectional,
and should be safe to do.
