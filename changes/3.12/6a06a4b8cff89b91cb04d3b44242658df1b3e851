[SCSI] IB/iser: Add Discovery support

To run discovery over iSER we need to advertize the CAP_TEXT_NEGO capability
towards user space. Also need to make sure the login RX buffer is posted when
SendTargets TEXT PDUs are sent. For that end, we use a setting of the
ISCSI_PARAM_DISCOVERY_SESS iscsi param as an indication that this is
discovery session.
