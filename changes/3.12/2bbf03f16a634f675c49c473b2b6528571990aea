perf stat: Flush output after each line in interval mode

When interval mode is outputting to a pipe, each measurement should be
flushed individually, so that the reader sees it timely.

With a terminal each line is automatically flushed by stdio, but that is
disabled with non terminal output.

Simply fflush output after each time interval
