tcp: Change return value of tcp_rcv_established()

tcp_rcv_established() returns only one value namely 0. We change the return
value to void (as suggested by David Miller).

After commit 0c24604b (tcp: implement RFC 5961 4.2), we no longer send RSTs in
response to SYNs. We can remove the check and processing on the return value of
tcp_rcv_established().

We also fix jtcp_rcv_established() in tcp_probe.c to match that of
tcp_rcv_established().
