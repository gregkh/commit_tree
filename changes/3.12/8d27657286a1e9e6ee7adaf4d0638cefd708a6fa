ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: wait for completion when kicking the clock

To reconfigure clocks, controlled by FRQCRA and FRQCRB, a kick bit has to
be set and to make sure the setting has taken effect, it has to be read
back repeatedly until it is cleared by the hardware. This patch adds the
waiting part, that was missing until now.
