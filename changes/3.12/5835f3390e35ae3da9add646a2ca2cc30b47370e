fuse: use d_materialise_unique()

Use d_materialise_unique() instead of d_splice_alias().  This allows dentry
subtrees to be moved to a new place if there moved, even if something is
referencing a dentry in the subtree (open fd, cwd, etc..).

This will also allow us to drop a subtree if it is found to be replaced by
something else.  In this case the disconnected subtree can later be
reconnected to its new location.

d_materialise_unique() ensures that a directory entry only ever has one
alias.  We keep fc->inst_mutex around the calls for d_materialise_unique()
on directories to prevent a race with mkdir "stealing" the inode.
