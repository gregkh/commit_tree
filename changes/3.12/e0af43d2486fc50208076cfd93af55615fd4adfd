perf hists: Marking dummy hists entries

It does not make sense to make some computation (ratio, wdiff), when the
hist_entry is 'dummy' - added via hists__link.

Adding dummy field to struct hist_entry which indicates that it was
added by hists__link and avoiding some of the processing for such
entries.
