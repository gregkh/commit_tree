nohz: Include local CPU in full dynticks global kick

tick_nohz_full_kick_all() is useful to notify all full dynticks
CPUs that there is a system state change to checkout before
re-evaluating the need for the tick.

Unfortunately this is implemented using smp_call_function_many()
that ignores the local CPU. This CPU also needs to re-evaluate
the tick.

on_each_cpu_mask() is not useful either because we don't want to
re-evaluate the tick state in place but asynchronously from an IPI
to avoid messing up with any random locking scenario.

So lets call tick_nohz_full_kick() from tick_nohz_full_kick_all()
so that the usual irq work takes care of it.
