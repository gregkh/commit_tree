staging: comedi: usbdux: fix usbdux_counter_write()

Comedi (*insn_write) operations are supposed to write insn->n values.
Fix this function to work like the core expects.

Rename the local variable used for the private data pointer to the
comedi "norm".

Remove the unnecessary sanity check of the private data pointer. This
function can only be called is the private data was allocated during
the attach.
