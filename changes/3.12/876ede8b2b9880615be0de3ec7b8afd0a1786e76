cgroup: restructure the failure path in cgroup_write_event_control()

It uses a single label and checks the validity of each pointer. This
is err-prone, and actually we had a bug because one of the check was
insufficient.

Use multi lables as we do in other places.

v2:
- drop initializations of local variables.
