Btrfs: actually log directory we are fsync()'ing

If you just create a directory and then fsync that directory and then pull the
power plug you will come back up and the directory will not be there.  That is
because we won't actually create directories if we've logged files inside of
them since they will be created on replay, but in this check we will set our
logged_trans of our current directory if it happens to be a directory, making us
think it doesn't need to be logged.  Fix the logic to only do this to parent
directories.  Thanks,
