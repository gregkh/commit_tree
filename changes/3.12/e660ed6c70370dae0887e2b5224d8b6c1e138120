Bluetooth: Use hci_connect_sco directly

hci_connect is a super function for connecting hci protocols. But the
voice_setting parameter (introduced in subsequent patches) is only
needed by SCO and security requirements are not needed for SCO channels.
Thus, it makes sense to have a separate function for SCO.
