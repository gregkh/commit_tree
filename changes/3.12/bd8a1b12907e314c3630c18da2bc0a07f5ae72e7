ixgbe: fix incorrect limit value in ring transverse

We were transversing the tx_ring with IXGBE_NUM_RX_QUEUES.  Now this define
happens to have the correct value but this is misleading and a change later
could easily make this no longer true.  I updated it to netdev->num_tx_queues
like we use in ixgbe_get_strings().
