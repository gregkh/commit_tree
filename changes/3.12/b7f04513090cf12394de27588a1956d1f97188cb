IB/iser: Accept session->cmds_max from user space

Use cmds_max passed from user space to be the number of PDUs to be
supported for the session instead of hard-coded ISCSI_DEF_XMIT_CMDS_MAX.
This allow controlling the max number of SCSI commands for the session.
Also don't ignore the qdepth passed from user space.

Derive from session->cmds_max the actual number of RX buffers and FMR
pool size to allocate during the connection bind phase.

Since the iser transport connection is established before the iscsi
session/connection are created and bound, we still use one hard-coded
quantity ISER_DEF_XMIT_CMDS_MAX to compute the maximum number of
work-requests to be supported by the RC QP used for the connection.

The above quantity is made to be a power of two between ISCSI_TOTAL_CMDS_MIN
(16) and ISER_DEF_XMIT_CMDS_MAX (512) inclusive.
