ATA / ACPI: remove power dependent device handling

Previously, we wanted SCSI devices corrsponding to ATA devices to
be runtime resumed when the power resource for those ATA device was
turned on by some other device, so we added the SCSI device to the
dependent device list of the ATA device's ACPI node.  However, this
code has no effect after commit 41863fc (ACPI / power: Drop automaitc
resume of power resource dependent devices) and the mechanism it was
supposed to implement is regarded as a bad idea now, so drop it.
