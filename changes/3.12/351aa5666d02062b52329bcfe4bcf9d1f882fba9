drm/i915: tune the RC6 threshold for stability

It's basically the same deal as the RC6+ issues on ivy bridge
except this time with RC6 on sandy bridge. Like last time the
core of the issue is that the timings don't work 100% with our
voltage regulator. So from time to time, the kernel will print
a warning message about the GPU not getting out of RC6. In
particular, I found this fairly easy to reproduce during
suspend/resume.

Changing the threshold to 125000 instead of 50000 seems to fix
the issue. The previous patch used 150000 but as it turns out
this doesn't work everywhere. After getting such a machine, I
bisected the highest value which works, which is 125000, so here
it is.

I also measured the idle power usage before/after this patch and
didn't see a difference on a sandy bridge laptop. On haswell and
up, it makes a big difference, so we want to keep it at 50k
there. It also seems like haswell doesn't have the RC6 issues
that sandy bridge has so the 50k value is fine.
