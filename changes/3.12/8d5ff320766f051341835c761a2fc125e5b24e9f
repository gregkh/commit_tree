powerpc/pseries: Make dlpar_configure_connector parent node aware

Currently the device nodes created in the device subtree returned by a call to
dlpar_configure_connector are all named in the root node. This is because the
the node name in the work area returned by ibm,configure-connector rtas call
only contains the node name and not the entire node path. Passing the parent
node where the new subtree will be created to dlpar_configure_connector allows
the correct node path to be prefixed in the full_name field.
