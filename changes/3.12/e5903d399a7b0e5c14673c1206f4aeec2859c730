drm/radeon: fix init ordering for r600+

The vram scratch buffer needs to be initialized
before the mc is programmed otherwise we program
0 as the GPU address of the default GPU fault
page.  In most cases we put vram at zero anyway and
reserve a page for the legacy vga buffer so in practice
this shouldn't cause any problems, but better to make
it correct.
