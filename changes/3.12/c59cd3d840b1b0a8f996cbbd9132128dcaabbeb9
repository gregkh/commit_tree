cgroup: make cgroup_task_iter remember the cgroup being iterated

Currently all cgroup_task_iter functions require @cgrp to be passed
in, which is superflous and increases chance of usage error.  Make
cgroup_task_iter remember the cgroup being iterated and drop @cgrp
argument from next and end functions.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior differences.
