reiserfs: locking, release lock around quota operations

Previous commits released the write lock across quota operations but
missed several places.  In particular, the free operations can also
call into the file system code and take the write lock, causing
deadlocks.

This patch introduces some more helpers and uses them for quota call
sites.  Without this patch applied, reiserfs + quotas runs into deadlocks
under anything more than trivial load.
