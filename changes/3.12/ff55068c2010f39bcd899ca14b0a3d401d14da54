xfs: introduce xfs_sb.c for sharing with libxfs

xfs_mount.c is shared with userspace, but the only functions that
are shared are to do with physical superblock manipulations. This
means that less than 25% of the xfs_mount.c code is actually shared
with userspace. Move all the superblock functions to xfs_sb.c and
share that instead with libxfs.

Note that this will leave all the in-core transaction related
superblock counter modifications in xfs_mount.c as none of that is
shared with userspace. With a few more small changes, xfs_mount.h
won't need to be shared with userspace anymore, either.
