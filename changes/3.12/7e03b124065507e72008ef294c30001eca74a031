NVMe: Bring up cdev on set feature failure

This patch creates the character device as long as a device's admin queues
are usable so a user has an opprotunity to perform administration tasks.
A device may be in a state that does not allow IO and setting the queue
count feature in such a state returns an error. Previously the driver
would bail and the controller would be unusable.
