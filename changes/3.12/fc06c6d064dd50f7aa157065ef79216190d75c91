xfs: separate out log format definitions

The on-disk format definitions for the log are spread randoms
through a couple of header files. Consolidate it all in a single
file that can be shared easily with userspace. This means that
xfs_log.h and xfs_log_priv.h no longer need to be shared with
userspace.
