s390/mm: cleanup page table definitions

Improve the encoding of the different pte types and the naming of the
page, segment table and region table bits. Due to the different pte
encoding the hugetlbfs primitives need to be adapted as well. To improve
compatability with common code make the huge ptes use the encoding of
normal ptes. The conversion between the pte and pmd encoding for a huge
pte is done with set_huge_pte_at and huge_ptep_get.
Overall the code is now easier to understand.
