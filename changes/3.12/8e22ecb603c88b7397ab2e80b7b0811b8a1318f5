HID: wiimote: add support for Guitar-Hero guitars

Apart from drums, Guitar-Hero also ships with guitars. Use the recently
introduced input ABS/BTN-bits to report this to user-space.

Devices are reported as "Nintendo Wii Remote Guitar". If I ever get my
hands on "RockBand" guitars, I will try to report them via the same
interface so user-space does not have to bother which device it deals
with.
