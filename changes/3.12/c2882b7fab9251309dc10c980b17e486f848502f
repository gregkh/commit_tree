MIPS: kexec: Fix random crashes while loading crashkernel

Fixed compilation errors in case of non-KEXEC kernel
Rearranging code so that crashk_res gets updated.
- crashk_res is updated after mips_parse_crashkernel(),
   after resource_init(), which is after arch_mem_init().
- The reserved memory is actually treated as Usable memory,
   Unless we load the crash kernel, everything works.
