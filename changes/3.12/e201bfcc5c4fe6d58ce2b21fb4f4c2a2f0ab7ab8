x86/xen: during early setup, only 1:1 map the ISA region

During early setup, when the reserved regions and MMIO holes are being
setup as 1:1 in the p2m, clear any mappings instead of making them 1:1
(execept for the ISA region which is expected to be mapped).

This fixes a regression introduced in 3.5 by 83d51ab473dd (xen/setup:
update VA mapping when releasing memory during setup) which caused
hosts with tboot to fail to boot.

tboot marks a region in the e820 map as unusable and the dom0 kernel
would attempt to map this region and Xen does not permit unusable
regions to be mapped by guests.
