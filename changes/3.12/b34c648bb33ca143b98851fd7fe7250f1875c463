checkpatch: better --fix of SPACING errors.

Previous attempt at fixing SPACING errors could make a hash of several
defects.

This patch should make --fix be a lot better at correcting these defects.

Trim left and right sides of these defects appropriately instead of a
somewhat random attempt at it.

Trim left spaces from any following bit of the modified line when only a
single space is required around an operator.
