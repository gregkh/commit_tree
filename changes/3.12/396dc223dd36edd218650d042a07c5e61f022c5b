Bluetooth: Take proper tty_struct references

In net/bluetooth/rfcomm/tty.c the struct tty_struct is used without
taking references. This may lead to a use-after-free of the rfcomm tty.

Fix this by taking references properly, using the tty_port_* helpers
when possible.

The raw assignments of dev->port.tty in rfcomm_tty_open/close are
addressed in the later commit 'rfcomm: Implement .activate, .shutdown
and .carrier_raised methods'.
