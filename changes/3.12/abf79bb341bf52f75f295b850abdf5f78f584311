NFS: Add a slot table to struct nfs_client for NFSv4.0 transport blocking

Anchor an nfs4_slot_table in the nfs_client for use with NFSv4.0
transport blocking.  It is initialized only for NFSv4.0 nfs_client's.

Introduce appropriate minor version ops to handle nfs_client
initialization and shutdown requirements that differ for each minor
version.
