x86, relocs: Move ELF relocation handling to C

Moves the relocation handling into C, after decompression. This requires
that the decompressed size is passed to the decompression routine as
well so that relocations can be found. Only kernels that need relocation
support will use the code (currently just x86_32), but this is laying
the ground work for 64-bit using it in support of KASLR.

Based on work by Neill Clift and Michael Davidson.
