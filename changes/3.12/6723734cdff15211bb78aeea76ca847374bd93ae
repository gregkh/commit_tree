panic: call panic handlers before kmsg_dump

Since the panic handlers may produce additional information (via printk)
for the kernel log, it should be reported as part of the panic output
saved by kmsg_dump().  Without this re-ordering, nothing that adds
information to a panic will show up in pstore's view when kmsg_dump runs,
and is therefore not visible to crash reporting tools that examine pstore
output.
