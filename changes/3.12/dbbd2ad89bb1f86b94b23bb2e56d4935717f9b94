net/ethernet: cpsw: Bugfix interrupts before enabling napi

If interrupts happen before napi_enable was called, the driver will not
work as expected. Network transmissions are impossible in this state.
This bug can be reproduced easily by restarting the network interface in
a loop. After some time any network transmissions on the network
interface will fail.

This patch fixes the bug by enabling napi before enabling the network
interface interrupts.
