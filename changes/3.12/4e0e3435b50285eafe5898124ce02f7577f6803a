powerpc/85xx: Add machine check handler to fix PCIe erratum on mpc85xx

A PCIe erratum of mpc85xx may causes a core hang when a link of PCIe
goes down. when the link goes down, Non-posted transactions issued
via the ATMU requiring completion result in an instruction stall.
At the same time a machine-check exception is generated to the core
to allow further processing by the handler. We implements the handler
which skips the instruction caused the stall.

This patch depends on patch:
powerpc/85xx: Add platform_device declaration to fsl_pci.h
