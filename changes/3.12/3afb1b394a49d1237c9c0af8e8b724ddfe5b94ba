n_tty: Special case pty flow control

The pty driver forces ldisc flow control on, regardless of available
receive buffer space, so the writer can be woken whenever unthrottle
is called. However, this 'forced throttle' has performance
consequences, as multiple atomic operations are necessary to
unthrottle and perform the write wakeup for every input line (in
canonical mode).

Instead, short-circuit the unthrottle if the tty is a pty and perform
the write wakeup directly.
