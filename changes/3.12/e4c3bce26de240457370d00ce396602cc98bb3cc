ALSA: hda - Headphone mic support for an Asus/Conexant device

This Conexant codec has a single jack that can be used as either
headphone or mic (but not headset). The existing hp_mic functionality
does not apply here, because the mic and the HP are on separate pins.

Hence make a lighter version of what has been earlier done for Realtek
codecs.
