memcg: check for proper lock held in mem_cgroup_update_page_stat

We should call mem_cgroup_begin_update_page_stat() before
mem_cgroup_update_page_stat() to get proper locks, however the latter
doesn't do any checking that we use proper locking, which would be hard.
Suggested by Michal Hock we could at least test for rcu_read_lock_held()
because RCU is held if !mem_cgroup_disabled().
