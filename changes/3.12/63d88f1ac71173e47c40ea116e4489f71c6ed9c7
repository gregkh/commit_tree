clocksource: sun4i: Fix the next event code

The next_event logic was setting the next interval to fire in the
current timer value instead of the interval value register, which is
obviously wrong.

Plus, the logic to set the actual value was wrong as well: the interval
register can only be modified when the timer is disabled, and then
enable it back, otherwise, it'll have no effect. Fix this logic as well
since that code couldn't possibly work.
