ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Fix NULL pointer dereference in cleanup_bridge()

After commit bbd34fc (ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Register all devices
under the given bridge) register_slot() is called for all PCI
devices under a given bridge that have corresponding objects in
the ACPI namespace, but it calls acpiphp_register_hotplug_slot()
only for devices satisfying specific criteria.  Still,
cleanup_bridge() calls acpiphp_unregister_hotplug_slot() for all
objects created by register_slot(), although it should only call it
for the ones that acpiphp_register_hotplug_slot() has been called
for (successfully).  This causes a NULL pointer to be dereferenced
by the acpiphp_unregister_hotplug_slot() executed by cleanup_bridge()
if the object it is called for has not been passed to
acpiphp_register_hotplug_slot().

To fix this problem, check if the 'slot' field of the object passed
to acpiphp_unregister_hotplug_slot() in cleanup_bridge() is not NULL,
which only is the case if acpiphp_register_hotplug_slot() has been
executed for that object.  In addition to that, make register_slot()
reset the 'slot' field to NULL if acpiphp_register_hotplug_slot() has
failed for the given object to prevent stale pointers from being
used by acpiphp_unregister_hotplug_slot().
