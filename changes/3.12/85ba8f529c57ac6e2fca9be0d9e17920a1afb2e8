cw1200: Prevent a lock-related hang in the cw1200_spi driver

The cw1200_spi driver tries to mirror the cw1200_sdio driver's lock
API, which relies on sdio_claim_host/sdio_release_host to serialize
hardware operations across multiple threads.

Unfortunately the implementation was flawed, as it lacked a way to wake
up the lock requestor when there was contention, often resulting in a
hang.

This problem was uncovered while trying to fix the
spi-transfers-in-interrupt-context BUG() corrected in the previous
patch.  Many thanks to Dave Sizeburns for his assistance in fixing this.
