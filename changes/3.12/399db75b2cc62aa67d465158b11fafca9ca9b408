fec: Remove unneeded check in platform_get_resource()

As devm_ioremap_resource() is used, there is no need to explicitely check the
return value from platform_get_resource(), as this is something that
devm_ioremap_resource() takes care by itself.

Also, place platform_get_resource() prior to devm_ioremap_resource() for
better code readability.
