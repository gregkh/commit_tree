x86, efi: Don't map Boot Services on i386

Add patch to fix 32bit EFI service mapping (rhbz 726701)

Multiple people are reporting hitting the following WARNING on i386,

  WARNING: at arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:102 __ioremap_caller+0x3d3/0x440()

Due to the workaround described in commit 916f676f8 ("x86, efi: Retain
boot service code until after switching to virtual mode") EFI Boot
Service regions are mapped for a period during boot. Unfortunately, with
the limited size of the i386 direct kernel map it's possible that some
of the Boot Service regions will not be directly accessible, which
causes them to be ioremap()'d, triggering the above warning as the
regions are marked as E820_RAM in the e820 memmap.

There are currently only two situations where we need to map EFI Boot
Service regions,

  1. To workaround the firmware bug described in 916f676f8
  2. To access the ACPI BGRT image

but since we haven't seen an i386 implementation that requires either,
this simple fix should suffice for now.
