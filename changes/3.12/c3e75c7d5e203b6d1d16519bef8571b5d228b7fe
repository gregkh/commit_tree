[media] v4l2-dv-timings: fix CVT calculation

This patch fixes two errors that caused incorrect format detections:
The first bug is in the calculation of the vertical backporch: the combined
period of vsync and backporch must *exceed* a certain minimum value, and not
be equal to it.
The second bug is a rounding error in the reduced blanking calculation:
expand the ideal_duty_cylce to be in parts per ten thousand to avoid
rounding errors.
