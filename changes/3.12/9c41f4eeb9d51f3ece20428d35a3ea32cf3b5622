ARC: Incorrect mm reference used in vmalloc fault handler

A vmalloc fault needs to sync up PGD/PTE entry from init_mm to current
task's "active_mm".  ARC vmalloc fault handler however was using mm.

A vmalloc fault for non user task context (actually pre-userland, from
init thread's open for /dev/console) caused the handler to deref NULL mm
(for mm->pgd)

The reasons it worked so far is amazing:

1. By default (!SMP), vmalloc fault handler uses a cached value of PGD.
   In SMP that MMU register is repurposed hence need for mm pointer deref.

2. In pre-3.12 SMP kernel, the problem triggering vmalloc didn't exist in
   pre-userland code path - it was introduced with commit 20bafb3d23d108bc
   "n_tty: Move buffers into n_tty_data"
