spi: simplify devm_request_mem_region/devm_ioremap

Convert the composition of devm_request_mem_region and devm_ioremap to a
single call to devm_ioremap_resource.  The associated call to
platform_get_resource is also simplified and moved next to the new call to
devm_ioremap_resource.

This was done using a combination of the semantic patches
devm_ioremap_resource.cocci and devm_request_and_ioremap.cocci, found in
the scripts/coccinelle/api directory.

This patch also removes the label exit_busy, to use the error code returned
by the failing operation, rather than always -EBUSY.
