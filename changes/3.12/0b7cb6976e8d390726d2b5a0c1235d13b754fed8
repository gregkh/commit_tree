staging/vt6656: Fix screwed up indentation in swGetOFDMControlRate

The indentation in the swGetOFDMControlRate function is screwed up.
At first it appears that there are missing braces on a multi-line if, but
looking at history, commit dd0a774fc727ee793780197beb3f2cf80bfefa99
("staging: vt6656: card/main_usb/device use new structure names")
incorrectly indented the two lines below.
