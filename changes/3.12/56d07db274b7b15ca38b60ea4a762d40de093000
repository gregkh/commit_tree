cpufreq: Remove temporary fix for race between CPU hotplug and sysfs-writes

Commit "cpufreq: serialize calls to __cpufreq_governor()" had been a temporary
and partial solution to the race condition between writing to a cpufreq sysfs
file and taking a CPU offline. Now that we have a proper and complete solution
to that problem, remove the temporary fix.
