Btrfs: skip subvol entries when checking if we've created a dir already

We have logic to see if we've already created a parent directory by check to see
if an inode inside of that directory has a lower inode number than the one we
are currently processing.  The logic is that if there is a lower inode number
then we would have had to made sure the directory was created at that previous
point.  The problem is that subvols inode numbers count from the lowest objectid
in the root tree, which may be less than our current progress.  So just skip if
our dir item key is a root item.  This fixes the original test and the xfstest
version I made that added an extra subvol create.  Thanks,
