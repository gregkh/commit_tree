PCI: Return -ENOSYS for SR-IOV operations on non-SR-IOV devices

Change the return value to -ENOSYS if a device is not an SR-IOV PF.
Previously we returned either -ENODEV or -EINVAL.

Also have pci_sriov_get_totalvfs() return 0 in the error case to make the
behaviour consistent whether CONFIG_PCI_IOV is enabled or not.
