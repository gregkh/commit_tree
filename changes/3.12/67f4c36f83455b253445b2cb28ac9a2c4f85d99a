cgroup: add cgroup->dummy_css

cgroup subsystem API is being converted to use css
(cgroup_subsys_state) as the main handle, which makes things a bit
awkward for subsystem agnostic core features - the "cgroup.*"
interface files and various iterations - a bit awkward as they don't
have a css to use.

This patch adds cgroup->dummy_css which has NULL ->ss and whose only
role is pointing back to the cgroup.  This will be used to support
subsystem agnostic features on the coming css based API.

css_parent() is updated to handle dummy_css's.  Note that css will
soon grow its own ->parent field and css_parent() will be made
trivial.
