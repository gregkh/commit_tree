pinctrl: add includes and ifdefs for non-DT builds

Commit e81c8f18afc4fdd6e34d8c83814b8b5134dbb30f
"pinctrl: pinconf-generic: add generic APIs for mapping pinctrl node"
Added function prototypes with implicit dependencies
on other header files causing build warnings like this:

   unsigned *num_maps);

Let's just add ifdefs for non-DT systems (the actual code is
already ifdefed) and #include <linux/device.h> to get the
most important structs and forward-declare the pinctrl
core structs.
