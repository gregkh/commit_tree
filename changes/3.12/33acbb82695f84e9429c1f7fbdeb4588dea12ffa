serial: 8250_dw: Report CTS asserted for auto flow

When a serial port is configured for RTS/CTS flow control, serial core
will disable the transmitter if it observes CTS is de-asserted. This is
perfectly reasonable and appropriate when the UART lacks the ability to
automatically perform CTS flow control.

However, if the UART hardware can manage flow control automatically, it
is important that software not get involved.  When the DesignWare UART
enables 16C750 style auto-RTS/CTS it stops generating interrupts for
changes in CTS state so software mostly stays out of the way.  However,
it does report the true state of CTS in the MSR so software may notice
it is de-asserted and respond by improperly disabling the transmitter.
Once this happens the transmitter will be blocked forever.

To avoid this situation, we simply lie to the 8250 and serial core by
reporting that CTS is asserted whenever auto-RTS/CTS mode is enabled.
