drm/i915: rearrange vlv hdmi enable and pre_enable callbacks

VLV wants encoder enabling before the pipe is up. This is currently
achieved through calling the ->enable callback early, right after the
->pre_enable callback, in valleyview_crtc_enable(). This loses both the
distinction between ->pre_enable and ->enable on VLV and the possibility
to use a hook at the end of the modeset sequence.

Rearrange the HDMI callbacks to make it possible to move ->enable call
later. Basically do everything in ->pre_enable on VLV, and make ->enable
a NOP.

There should be no functional changes.

v2: Rebase.

v3: Explain why this is needed in the commit message (Chris).
