myri10ge: Add support for ndo_busy_poll

Add the ndo_busy_poll handler. Use skb_mark_napi_id to mark receive
packets with the napi id. For each slice, use per-slice spinlock and
state variable to ensure that only one handler processes receive
pacekts.

Locking, statistics counters, and the ndo_busy_poll handler follow
those in the ixgbe driver. So, credit goes to that driver's authors.
