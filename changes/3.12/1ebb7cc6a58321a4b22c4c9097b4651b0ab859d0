mm: munlock: batch NR_MLOCK zone state updates

Depending on previous batch which introduced batched isolation in
munlock_vma_range(), we can batch also the updates of NR_MLOCK page stats.
 After the whole pagevec is processed for page isolation, the stats are
updated only once with the number of successful isolations.  There were
however no measurable perfomance gains.
