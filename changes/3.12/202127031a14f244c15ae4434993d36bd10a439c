powerpc/eeh: powerpc/eeh: Fix undefined variable

changes for V4:
	- changes the type of frozen_pe_no from %d to %llu
	  in pr_devel()

'pe_no' hasn't been defined, it should be an typo error,
it should be 'frozen_pe_no'.

Also '__func__' has missed in IODA_EEH_DBG(),

For safety reasons, use pr_devel() directly, instead
of use IODA_EEH_DBG()
