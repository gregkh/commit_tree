perf/x86: Fix PMU detection printout when no PMU is detected

Ran into this cryptic PMU bootup log recently:

[    0.124047] Performance Events:
[    0.125000] smpboot: ...

Turns out we print this if no PMU is detected. Fall back to
the right condition so that the following is printed:

[    0.122381] Performance Events: no PMU driver, software events only.
