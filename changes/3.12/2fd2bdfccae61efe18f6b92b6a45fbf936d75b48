staging: comedi: pcmuio: fix possible NULL deref on detach

pcmuio_detach() is called by the comedi core even if pcmuio_attach()
returned an error, so `dev->private` might be `NULL`.  Check for that
before dereferencing it.

Also, as pointed out by Dan Carpenter, there is no need to check the
pointer passed to `kfree()` is non-NULL, so remove that check.
