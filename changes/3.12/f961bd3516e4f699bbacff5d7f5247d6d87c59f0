HID: detect Win 8 multitouch devices in core

Detecting Win 8 multitouch devices in core allows us to set quirks
before the device is parsed through hid_hw_start().
It also simplifies the detection of those devices in hid-multitouch and
makes the handling of those devices cleaner.

As Win 8 multitouch panels are in the group multitouch and rely on a
special feature to be detected, this patch adds a bitfield in the parser.
