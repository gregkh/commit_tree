cgroup: make task iterators deal with cgroup_subsys_state instead of cgroup

cgroup is in the process of converting to css (cgroup_subsys_state)
from cgroup as the principal subsystem interface handle.  This is
mostly to prepare for the unified hierarchy support where css's will
be created and destroyed dynamically but also helps cleaning up
subsystem implementations as css is usually what they are interested
in anyway.

This patch converts task iterators to deal with css instead of cgroup.
Note that under unified hierarchy, different sets of tasks will be
considered belonging to a given cgroup depending on the subsystem in
question and making the iterators deal with css instead cgroup
provides them with enough information about the iteration.

While at it, fix several function comment formats in cpuset.c.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior differences.
