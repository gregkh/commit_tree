6lowpan: Fix fragmentation with link-local compressed addresses

When a new 6lowpan fragment is received, a skbuff is allocated for
the reassembled packet. However when a 6lowpan packet compresses
link-local addresses based on link-layer addresses, the processing
function relies on the skb mac control block to find the related
link-layer address.

This patch copies the control block from the first fragment into
the newly allocated skb to keep a trace of the link-layer addresses
in case of a link-local compressed address.

Edit: small changes on comment issue
