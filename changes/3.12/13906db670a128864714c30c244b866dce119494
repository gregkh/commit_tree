powerpc/powernv: Return secondary CPUs to firmware on kexec

With OPAL v3 we can return secondary CPUs to firmware on kexec. This
allows firmware to do various cleanups making things generally more
reliable, and will enable the "new" kernel to call OPAL to perform
some reconfiguration tasks early on that can only be done while
all the CPUs are in firmware.
