Btrfs: rollback btrfs_device fields on umount

It turns out we don't properly rollback in-core btrfs_device state on
umount.  We zero out ->bdev, ->in_fs_metadata and that's about it.  In
particular, we don't zero out ->generation, and this can lead to us
refusing a mount -- a non-NULL fs_devices->latest_bdev is essential, but
btrfs_close_extra_devices will happily assign NULL to ->latest_bdev if
the first device on the dev_list happens to be missing and consequently
has no bdev attached.  This happens because since commit a6b0d5c8
btrfs_close_extra_devices adjusts ->latest_bdev, and in doing that,
relies on the ->generation.  Fix this, and possibly other problems, by
zeroing out everything except for what device_list_add sets, so that a
mount right after insmod and 'btrfs dev scan' is no different from any
later mount in this respect.
