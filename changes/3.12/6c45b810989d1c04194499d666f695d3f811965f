powerpc/kvm: Contiguous memory allocator based RMA allocation

Older version of power architecture use Real Mode Offset register and Real Mode Limit
Selector for mapping guest Real Mode Area. The guest RMA should be physically
contigous since we use the range when address translation is not enabled.

This patch switch RMA allocation code to use contigous memory allocator. The patch
also remove the the linear allocator which not used any more
