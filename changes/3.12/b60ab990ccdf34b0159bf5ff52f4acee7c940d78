dm thin: do not expose non-zero discard limits if discards disabled

Fix issue where the block layer would stack the discard limits of the
pool's data device even if the "ignore_discard" pool feature was
specified.

The pool and thin device(s) still had discards disabled because the
QUEUE_FLAG_DISCARD request_queue flag wasn't set.  But to avoid user
confusion when "ignore_discard" is used: both the pool device and the
thin device(s) have zeroes for all discard limits.

Also, always set discard_zeroes_data_unsupported in targets because they
should never advertise the 'discard_zeroes_data' capability (even if the
pool's data device supports it).
