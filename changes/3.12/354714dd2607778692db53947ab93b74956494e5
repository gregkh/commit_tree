x86, pvticketlock: Use callee-save for lock_spinning

Although the lock_spinning calls in the spinlock code are on the
uncommon path, their presence can cause the compiler to generate many
more register save/restores in the function pre/postamble, which is in
the fast path.  To avoid this, convert it to using the pvops callee-save
calling convention, which defers all the save/restores until the actual
function is called, keeping the fastpath clean.
