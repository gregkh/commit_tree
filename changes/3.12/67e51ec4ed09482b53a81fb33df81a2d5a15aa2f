uwb: Staticize local symbols

These local symbols are used only in this file.
Fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/uwb/drp-ie.c:30:5: warning: symbol 'uwb_rsv_reason_code' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/uwb/drp-ie.c:58:5: warning: symbol 'uwb_rsv_companion_reason_code' was not declared. Should it be static?
