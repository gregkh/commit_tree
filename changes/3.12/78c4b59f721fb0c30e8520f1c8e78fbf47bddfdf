KVM: s390: declare virtual HW facilities

The patch renames the array holding the HW facility bitmaps.
This allows to interprete the variable as set of virtual
machine specific "virtual" facilities. The basic idea is
to make virtual facilities externally managable in future.
An availability test for virtual facilites has been added
as well.
