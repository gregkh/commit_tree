ASoC: Remove unused control_type field from snd_soc_codec struct

The control_type field was used by the core to track which raw IO methods to
use, but when switching to regmap this was no longer necessary and so the last
user of the field was removed in commit be3ea3b9 ("ASoC: Use new register map
API for ASoC generic physical I/O"). The field is now completely unused and can
be removed.
