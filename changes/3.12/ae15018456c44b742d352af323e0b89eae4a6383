rcu: Make call_rcu() leak callbacks for debug-object errors

If someone does a duplicate call_rcu(), the worst thing the second
call_rcu() could do would be to actually queue the callback the second
time because doing so corrupts whatever list the callback was already
queued on.  This commit therefore makes __call_rcu() check the new
return value from debug-objects and leak the callback upon error.
This commit also substitutes rcu_leak_callback() for whatever callback
function was previously in place in order to avoid freeing the callback
out from under any readers that might still be referencing it.

These changes increase the probability that the debug-objects error
messages will actually make it somewhere visible.
