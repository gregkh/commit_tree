[media] media: stk1160: Ignore unchanged standard set

This commit adds an early check to vidioc_s_std() to detect if the
new and current standards are equal, and exit with success in that
case.
This is needed to prevent userspace applications that might attempt
to re-set the same standard from failing if that's done when streaming
has started.
