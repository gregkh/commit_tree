staging/lustre/llite: force lvb_data update after layout change

When a file is restored the layout lock is first
associated with the released layout and after restore
it has to be assocaited with the new layout. This patch
forces lvb_data update in ll_layout_fetch() even if one
is present (case for released->normal state change)
