x86: provide platform-devices for boot-framebuffers

The current situation regarding boot-framebuffers (VGA, VESA/VBE, EFI) on
x86 causes troubles when loading multiple fbdev drivers. The global
"struct screen_info" does not provide any state-tracking about which
drivers use the FBs. request_mem_region() theoretically works, but
unfortunately vesafb/efifb ignore it due to quirks for broken boards.

Avoid this by creating a platform framebuffer devices with a pointer
to the "struct screen_info" as platform-data. Drivers can now create
platform-drivers and the driver-core will refuse multiple drivers being
active simultaneously.

We keep the screen_info available for backwards-compatibility. Drivers
can be converted in follow-up patches.

Different devices are created for VGA/VESA/EFI FBs to allow multiple
drivers to be loaded on distro kernels. We create:
 - "vesa-framebuffer" for VBE/VESA graphics FBs
 - "efi-framebuffer" for EFI FBs
 - "platform-framebuffer" for everything else
This allows to load vesafb, efifb and others simultaneously and each
picks up only the supported FB types.

Apart from platform-framebuffer devices, this also introduces a
compatibility option for "simple-framebuffer" drivers which recently got
introduced for OF based systems. If CONFIG_X86_SYSFB is selected, we
try to match the screen_info against a simple-framebuffer supported
format. If we succeed, we create a "simple-framebuffer" device instead
of a platform-framebuffer.
This allows to reuse the simplefb.c driver across architectures and also
to introduce a SimpleDRM driver. There is no need to have vesafb.c,
efifb.c, simplefb.c and more just to have architecture specific quirks
in their setup-routines.

Instead, we now move the architecture specific quirks into x86-setup and
provide a generic simple-framebuffer. For backwards-compatibility (if
strange formats are used), we still allow vesafb/efifb to be loaded
simultaneously and pick up all remaining devices.
