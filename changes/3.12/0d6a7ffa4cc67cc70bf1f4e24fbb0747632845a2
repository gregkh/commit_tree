cpuidle: Check called function parameter in get_typical_interval()

get_typical_interval() uses int_sqrt() in calculation of standard
deviation. The formal parameter of int_sqrt() is unsigned long, which
may on some platforms be smaller than the 64 bit unsigned integer used
as the actual parameter. The overflow can occur frequently when actual
idle period lengths are in hundreds of milliseconds.

This patch adds a check for such overflow and rejects the candidate
average when an overflow would occur.
