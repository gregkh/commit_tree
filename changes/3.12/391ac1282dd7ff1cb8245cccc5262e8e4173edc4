can: gw: add a per rule limitation of frame hops

Usually the received CAN frames can be processed/routed as much as 'max_hops'
times (which is given at module load time of the can-gw module).
Introduce a new configuration option to reduce the number of possible hops
for a specific gateway rule to a value smaller then max_hops.
