drm/i915: Make PTE valid encoding optional

We need this to work around a corruption when the boot kernel image
loads the hibernated kernel image from swap on Haswell systems -
somehow not everything is properly shut off.

This is just the prep work, the next patch will implement the actual
workaround.
