drm/i915: enable the power well before module unload

Our driver initialization doesn't seem to be ready to load when the
power well is disabled: we hit a few "Unclaimed register" messages. So
do just like we already do for the suspend/resume path: enable the
power well before unloading.

At some point we'll want to be able to survive suspend/resume and
load/unload with the power well disabled, but for now let's just fix
the regression.

Regression introduced by the following commit:

    drm/i915: switch disable_power_well default value to 1

Bug can be reproduced by running the "module_reload" script from
intel-gpu-tools.
