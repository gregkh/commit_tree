xfs: return log item size in IOP_SIZE

To begin optimising the CIL commit process, we need to have IOP_SIZE
return both the number of vectors and the size of the data pointed
to by the vectors. This enables us to calculate the size ofthe
memory allocation needed before the formatting step and reduces the
number of memory allocations per item by one.

While there, kill the IOP_SIZE macro.
