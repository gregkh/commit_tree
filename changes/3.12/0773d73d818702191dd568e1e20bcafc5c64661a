ARM: move VFP init to an earlier boot stage

In order to use the NEON unit in the kernel, we should
initialize it a bit earlier in the boot process so NEON users
that like to do a quick benchmark at load time (like the
xor_blocks or RAID-6 code) find the NEON/VFP unit already
enabled.

Replaced late_initcall() with core_initcall().
