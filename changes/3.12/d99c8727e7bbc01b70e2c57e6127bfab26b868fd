cgroup: make cgroup_taskset deal with cgroup_subsys_state instead of cgroup

cgroup is in the process of converting to css (cgroup_subsys_state)
from cgroup as the principal subsystem interface handle.  This is
mostly to prepare for the unified hierarchy support where css's will
be created and destroyed dynamically but also helps cleaning up
subsystem implementations as css is usually what they are interested
in anyway.

cgroup_taskset which is used by the subsystem attach methods is the
last cgroup subsystem API which isn't using css as the handle.  Update
cgroup_taskset_cur_cgroup() to cgroup_taskset_cur_css() and
cgroup_taskset_for_each() to take @skip_css instead of @skip_cgrp.

The conversions are pretty mechanical.  One exception is
cpuset::cgroup_cs(), which lost its last user and got removed.

This patch shouldn't introduce any functional changes.
