mac80211: correctly close cancelled scans

__ieee80211_scan_completed is called from a worker. This
means that the following flow is possible.

 * driver calls ieee80211_scan_completed
 * mac80211 cancels the scan (that is already complete)
 * __ieee80211_scan_completed runs

When scan_work will finally run, it will see that the scan
hasn't been aborted and might even trigger another scan on
another band. This leads to a situation where cfg80211's
scan is not done and no further scan can be issued.

Fix this by setting a new flag when a HW scan is being
cancelled so that no other scan will be triggered.
