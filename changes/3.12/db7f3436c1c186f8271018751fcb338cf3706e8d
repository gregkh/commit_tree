Btrfs: deal with enomem in the rewind path

We can get ENOMEM trying to allocate dummy bufs for the rewind operation of the
tree mod log.  Instead of BUG_ON()'ing in this case pass up ENOMEM.  I looked
back through the callers and I'm pretty sure I got everybody who did BUG_ON(ret)
in this path.  Thanks,
