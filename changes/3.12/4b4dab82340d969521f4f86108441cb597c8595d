ASoC: rsnd: remove platform dai and add dai_id on platform setting

Current rsnd driver is using struct rsnd_dai_platform_info
so that indicate sound DAI information (playback/capture SSI ID).
But, SSI settings were also required separately.
Thus, platform settings was very un-understandable.
This patch adds dai_id to SSI
settings, and removed rsnd_dai_platform_info.
