Revert "x86/PCI: MMCONFIG: Check earlier for MMCONFIG region at address zero"

This reverts commit 07f9b61c3915e8eb156cb4461b3946736356ad02.

07f9b61c was intended to be a cleanup that didn't change anything, but in
fact, for systems without _CBA (which is almost everything), it broke
extended config space for domain 0 and all config space for other domains.
