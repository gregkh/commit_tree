drm/i915: grab force_wake when restoring LCPLL

If LCPLL is disabled, there's a chance we might be in package C8 state
or deeper, and we'll get a hard hang when restoring LCPLL (also, a red
led lights up on my motherboard). So grab the force_wake, which will
get us out of RC6 and, as a consequence, out of PC8+ (since we need
RC6 to get into PC8+).

Note: Discussions with hw designers are still ongoing what exactly
goes boom here. But I think we can go ahead and just merge this little
hack for now until it's clear what we actually need.
