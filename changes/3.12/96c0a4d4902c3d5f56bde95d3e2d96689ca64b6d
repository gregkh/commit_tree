ACPI / dock: Rework and simplify find_dock_devices()

Since acpi_walk_namespace() calls find_dock_devices() during tree
pre-order visit, the latter doesn't need to add devices whose
parents have _EJD pointing to the docking station to the list of
that station's dependent devices, because those parents are going to
be added to that list anyway and the removal of a parent will take
care of the removal of its children in those cases.

For this reason, rework find_dock_devices() to only call
add_dock_dependent_device() for devices whose _EJD point directy to
the docking station represented by its context argument and simplify
it slightly.
