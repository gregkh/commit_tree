Input: add SYN_MAX and SYN_CNT constants

SYN_* events are special and not enabled via set_bit() for devices. Hence,
they haven't been really needed, yet. However, user-space can still make
great use of that for int->string debugging helpers or alike.

Also, I haven't seen any reason not to define these, so here they are.
