drm: WARN when removing unallocated node

The conditional is usually a recoverable driver bug, and so WARNing, and
preventing the drm_mm code from doing potential damage (BUG) is
desirable.

This issue was hit and fixed twice while developing the i915 multiple
address space code. The first fix is the patch just before this, and is
hit on an not frequently occuring error path. Another was fixed during
patch iteration, so it's hard to see from the patch:
