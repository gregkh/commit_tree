mm, hugetlb: add VM_NORESERVE check in vma_has_reserves()

If we map the region with MAP_NORESERVE and MAP_SHARED, we can skip to
check reserve counting and eventually we cannot be ensured to allocate a
huge page in fault time.  With following example code, you can easily find
this situation.

Assume 2MB, nr_hugepages = 100

        fd = hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd();
        if (fd < 0)
                return 1;

        size = 200 * MB;
        flag = MAP_SHARED;
        p = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, flag, fd, 0);
        if (p == MAP_FAILED) {
                fprintf(stderr, "mmap() failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
                return -1;
        }

        size = 2 * MB;
        flag = MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED | MAP_HUGETLB | MAP_NORESERVE;
        p = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, flag, -1, 0);
        if (p == MAP_FAILED) {
                fprintf(stderr, "mmap() failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
        }
        p[0] = '0';
        sleep(10);

During executing sleep(10), run 'cat /proc/meminfo' on another process.

HugePages_Free:       99
HugePages_Rsvd:      100

Number of free should be higher or equal than number of reserve, but this
aren't.  This represent that non reserved shared mapping steal a reserved
page.  Non reserved shared mapping should not eat into reserve space.

If we consider VM_NORESERVE in vma_has_reserve() and return 0 which mean
that we don't have reserved pages, then we check that we have enough free
pages in dequeue_huge_page_vma().  This prevent to steal a reserved page.

With this change, above test generate a SIGBUG which is correct, because
all free pages are reserved and non reserved shared mapping can't get a
free page.
