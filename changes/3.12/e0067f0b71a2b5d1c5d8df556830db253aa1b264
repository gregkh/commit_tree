sata_mv: Remove unneeded CONFIG_HAVE_CLK ifdefs

If CONFIG_HAVE_CLK is not selected, then all the clk API turn out
into no-ops. In other words, there's no need to have the ifdefs.

The only side-effect of this patch is the extra tiny kmalloc,
but that's not enough reason to have such ugly ifdefs all around
the code.
