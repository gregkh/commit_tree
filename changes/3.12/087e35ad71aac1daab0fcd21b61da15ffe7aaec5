regulator: wm8350: correct the max_uV of LDO

As per datasheet, voltage range for LDOs are as follows:

	0000 = 0.9V
		...(50mV steps)
	01111 = 1.65V
	10000 = 1.8V
		... (100mV stepns)
	11111 = 3.3V

So, there is no  selector for 1.65V to 1.8V.
Correcting the range for max_uV for selector between 0 to 15.
