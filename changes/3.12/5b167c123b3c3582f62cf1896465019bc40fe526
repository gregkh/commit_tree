MIPS: Fix get_user_page_fast() for mips with cache alias

get_user_pages_fast() is missing cache flushes for MIPS platforms with
cache aliases.  Filesystem failures observed with DirectIO operations due
to missing flush_anon_page() that use page coloring logic to work with
cache aliases. This fix falls through to take slow_irqon path that calls
get_user_pages() that has required logic for platforms where
cpu_has_dc_aliases is true.
