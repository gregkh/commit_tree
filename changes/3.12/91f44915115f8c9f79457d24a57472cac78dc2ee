staging: comedi: Kconfig: COMEDI_NI_ATMIO16D should not depend on ISAPNP

The COMEDI_NI_ATMIO16D configuration option causes the "ni_atmio16d"
module to be built, which handles the National Instruments AT-MIO-16 and
AT-MIO-16D cards.  The configuration option currently depends on ISAPNP,
but the module doesn't use any ISAPNP functions and the cards are legacy
ISA cards with base I/O port, IRQ and DMA channel configured by jumpers.
(The driver doesn't use DMA though.)

Remove the ISADNP dependancy from COMEDI_NI_ATMIO16D and fix up the help
text - the card names are missing a dash and they're not ISA-PNP.
