xfs: refactor xfs_trans_reserve() interface

With the new xfs_trans_res structure has been introduced, the log
reservation size, log count as well as log flags are pre-initialized
at mount time.  So it's time to refine xfs_trans_reserve() interface
to be more neat.

Also, introduce a new helper M_RES() to return a pointer to the
mp->m_resv structure to simplify the input.
