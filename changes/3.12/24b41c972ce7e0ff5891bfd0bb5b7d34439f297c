e1000e: restore call to pci_clear_master()

In attempting to resolve a minor merge conflict, commit e5f2ef7ab4690d2e8faa
(Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net) accidentally
dropped a call to pci_clear_master() that was intended to remain in place.

Commit 4e0855dff094b0d56d6b (e1000e: fix pci-device enable-counter balance)
replaced a call to pci_disable_device() by one to pci_clear_master(). And then
commit 66148babe728f3e00e13 (e1000e: fix runtime power management transitions)
deleted a number of lines starting two lines following that call.

This patch restores the call to pci_clear_master() in __e1000_shutdown().
