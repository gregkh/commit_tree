watchdog: Make it work under full dynticks

A perf event can be used without forcing the tick to
stay alive if it doesn't use a frequency but a sample
period and if it doesn't throttle (raise storm of events).

Since the lockup detector neither use a perf event frequency
nor should ever throttle due to its high period, it can now
run concurrently with the full dynticks feature.

So remove the hack that disabled the watchdog.
