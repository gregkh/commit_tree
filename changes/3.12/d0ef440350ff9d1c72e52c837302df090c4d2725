powerpc/pseries: Pack update_props_workarea to map correctly to rtas buffer header

The work area buffer returned by the ibm,update-properties rtas call contains
20 bytes of header information prior to the property value descriptor data.
Currently update_dt_node tries to advance over this header using sizeof(upwa).
The update_props_workarea struct contains 20 bytes worth of fields, that map
to the relevant header data, but the sizeof the structure is 24 bytes due to
4 bytes of padding at the end of the structure. Packing the structure ensures
that we don't advance too far over the rtas buffer.
