fbdev: simplefb: mark as fw and allocate apertures

fbdev-core uses FBINFO_MISC_FIRMWARE to mark drivers that use firmware
framebuffers. Furthermore, we now allocate apertures for the fbinfo
device.
Both information is used by remove_conflicting_framebuffers() to remove a
fbdev device whenever a real driver is loaded. This is used heavily on x86
for VGA/vesa/EFI framebuffers, but is also of great use for all other
systems.

Especially with x86 support for simplefb, this information is needed to
unload simplefb before a real hw-driver (like i915, radeon, nouveau) is
loaded.
