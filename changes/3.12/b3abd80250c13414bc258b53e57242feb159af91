lockref: add 'lockref_get_or_lock() helper

This behaves like "lockref_get_not_zero()", but instead of doing nothing
if the count was zero, it returns with the lock held.

This allows callers to revalidate the lockref-protected data structure
if required even if the count was zero to begin with, and possibly
increment the count if it passes muster.

In particular, the dentry code wants this when it wants to turn an
RCU-protected dentry into a stable refcounted one: if the dentry count
it zero, but the sequence number still validates the dentry, we can take
a reference to it.
