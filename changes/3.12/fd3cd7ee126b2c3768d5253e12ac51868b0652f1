OMAPDSS: HDMI: Fix AVI infoframe bug

ti_hdmi_4xxx_basic_configure() is supposed to initialize the AVI
infoframe data in the ip_data container. However, the function actually
takes a copy of the infoframe from the ip_data, and then goes on
initializing that copy. The initialized data is never copied back to the
ip_data container, thus the infoframe in ip_data is left always zero.

Afaik, this doesn't really cause any issues in the current mainline, as
we don't use the advanced features offered by the AVI infoframe.

This patch fixes the initialization of the AVI infoframe.
