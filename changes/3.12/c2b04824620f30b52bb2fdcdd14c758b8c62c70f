dm ioctl: prevent rename to empty name or uuid

A device-mapper device must always have a name consisting of a non-empty
string.  If the device also has a uuid, this similarly must not be an
empty string.

The DM_DEV_CREATE ioctl enforces these rules when the device is created,
but this patch is needed to enforce them when DM_DEV_RENAME is used to
change the name or uuid.
