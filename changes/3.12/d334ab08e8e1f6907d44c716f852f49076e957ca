[media] exynos4-is: Handle suspend/resume of fimc-is-i2c correctly

If the same callbacks are used for runtime and system suspend/resume,
clocks can get disabled twice, which can lead to negative reference
counts and kernel warnings.
This patch splits suspend/resume callbacks into separate runtime and
system-wide functions, so clock gating is done correctly.
