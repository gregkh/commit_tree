staging/lustre/lmv: fix duplicate directory entries

Previously, I accidentally introduced a new way for duplicate
directory entries to be returned from readdir().  That patch fails
to properly decrement the nlupgs counter when breaking out of the
inner-for loop.  This accounting error causes an extra iteration
of the inner-for loop when processing the next cfs page and a bad
ldp_hash_end value is then saved in the lu_dirpage.  To fix this,
always decrement the nlupgs counter on entry into the inner loop.

Note: this bug only affects architectures with > 4k-sized pages, e.g.
PowerPC.
