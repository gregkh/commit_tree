bonding: convert bond_has_this_ip() to use upper devices

Currently, bond_has_this_ip() is aware only of vlan upper devices, and thus
will return false if the address is associated with the upper bridge or any
other device, and thus will break the arp logic.

Fix this by using the upper device list. For every upper device we verify
if the address associated with it is our address, and if yes - return true.
