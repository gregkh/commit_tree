Revert "usb: pl2303: fix+improve the divsor based baud rate encoding method"

This reverts commit 57ce61aad748ceaa08c859da04043ad7dae7c15e.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
