vfio-pci: Use fdget() rather than eventfd_fget()

eventfd_fget() tests to see whether the file is an eventfd file, which
we then immediately pass to eventfd_ctx_fileget(), which again tests
whether the file is an eventfd file.  Simplify slightly by using
fdget() so that we only test that we're looking at an eventfd once.
fget() could also be used, but fdget() makes use of fget_light() for
another slight optimization.
