staging: android: binder: replace types with portable ones

Since this driver is meant to be used on different types of processors
and a portable driver should specify the size a variable expects to be
this patch changes the types used throughout the binder interface.

We use "userspace" types since this header will be exported and used by
the Android filesystem.

The patch does not change in any way the functionality of the binder driver.
