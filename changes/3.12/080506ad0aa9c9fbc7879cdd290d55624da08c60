block: change config option name for cmdline partition parsing

Recently commit bab55417b10c ("block: support embedded device command
line partition") introduced CONFIG_CMDLINE_PARSER.  However, that name
is too generic and sounds like it enables/disables generic kernel boot
arg processing, when it really is block specific.

Before this option becomes a part of a full/final release, add the BLK_
prefix to it so that it is clear in absence of any other context that it
is block specific.

In addition, fix up the following less critical items:
 - help text was not really at all helpful.
 - index file for Documentation was not updated
 - add the new arg to Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
 - clarify wording in source comments
