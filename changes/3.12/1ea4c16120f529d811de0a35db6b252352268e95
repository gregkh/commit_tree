Input: add driver for slidebar on Lenovo IdeaPad laptops

This driver adds support for slidebars found on some Lenovo IdeaPad
laptops (the slidebars work with SlideNav/Desktop Navigator under
Windows).

Fixes: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16004

Registers 'IdeaPad Slidebar' input device and
/sys/devices/platform/ideapad_slidebar/slidebar_mode
for switching slidebar's modes.

Now works on:
IdeaPad Y550, Y550P.

May work on (testing and adding new models is needed):
Ideapad Y560, Y460, Y450, Y650,
and, probably, some others.
