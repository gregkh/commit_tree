ARM: KVM: Bugfix: vgic_bytemap_get_reg per cpu regs

For bytemaps each IRQ field is 1 byte wide, so we pack 4 irq fields in
one word and since there are 32 private (per cpu) irqs, we have 8
private u32 fields on the vgic_bytemap struct.  We shift the offset from
the base of the register group right by 2, giving us the word index
instead of the field index.  But then there are 8 private words, not 4,
which is also why we subtract 8 words from the offset of the shared
words.
