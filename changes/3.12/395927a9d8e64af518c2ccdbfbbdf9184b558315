Btrfs: optimize function btrfs_read_chunk_tree

After reading all device items from the chunk tree, don't
exit the loop and then navigate down the tree again to find
the chunk items. Instead just read all device items and
chunk items with a single tree search. This is possible
because all device items are found before any chunk item in
the chunks tree.
