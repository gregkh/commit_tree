[SCSI] hpsa: fix a race in cmd_free/scsi_done

When the driver calls scsi_done and after that frees it's internal
preallocated memory it can happen that a new job is enqueud before
the memory is freed. The allocation fails and the message
"cmd_alloc returned NULL" is shown.
Patch below fixes it by moving cmd->scsi_done after cmd_free.
