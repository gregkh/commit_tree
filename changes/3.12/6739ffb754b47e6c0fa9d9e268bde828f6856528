SUNRPC: Add a framework to clean up management of rpc_pipefs directories

The current system requires everyone to set up notifiers, manage directory
locking, etc.
What we really want to do is have the rpc_client create its directory,
and then create all the entries.

This patch will allow the RPCSEC_GSS and NFS code to register all the
objects that they want to have appear in the directory, and then have
the sunrpc code call them back to actually create/destroy their pipefs
dentries when the rpc_client creates/destroys the parent.
