drm/i915: Don't mask EI UP interrupt on IVB|SNB

Submitting a batchbuffer which simulates a gpu
hang by doing MI_BATCH_BUFFER_START into itself,
to test hangcheck, started to hard hang the whole box
(IVB). Bisecting lead to this commit:

    drm/i915: Only unmask required PM interrupts

Experimenting with the mask register showed that
unmasking EI UP will prevent the hard hang in IVB and SNB.
HSW doesn't hang with EI UP masked.

Considering we are just disabling interrupts that aren't even
delivered to driver, this change is more likely to paper over some
weirdness in gpu's internal state machine. But until better
explanation can be found, let's trade little bit of power
for stability on these architectures.

v2: - Unmask EI_EXPIRED directly in I915_WRITE (Vinit)
v3: - Only unmask on SNB and IVB
