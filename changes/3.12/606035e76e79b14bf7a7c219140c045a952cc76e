autofs4: close the races around autofs4_notify_daemon()

Don't drop ->wq_mutex before calling autofs4_notify_daemon() only to regain it
there.  Besides being pointless, that opens a race window where autofs4_wait_release()
could've come and freed wq->name.name.  And do the debugging printk in the "reused an
existing wq" case before dropping ->wq_mutex - the same reason...
