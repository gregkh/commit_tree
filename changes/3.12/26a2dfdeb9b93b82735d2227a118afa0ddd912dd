dma: mmp_pdma: clear DRCMR when free a phy channel

In mmp pdma, phy channels are allocated/freed dynamically.
The mapping from DMA request to DMA channel number in DRCMR
should be cleared when a phy channel is freed. Otherwise
conflicts will happen when:
1. A is using channel 2 and free it after finished, but A
still maps to channel 2 in DRCMR of A.
2. Now another one B gets channel 2. So B maps to channel 2
too in DRCMR of B.
In the datasheet, it is described that "Do not map two active
requests to the same channel since it produces unpredictable
results" and we can observe that during test.
