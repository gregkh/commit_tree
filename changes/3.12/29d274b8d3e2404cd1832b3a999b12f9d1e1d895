x86/simplefb: Mark framebuffer mem-resources as IORESOURCE_BUSY to avoid bootup warning

IORESOURCE_BUSY is used to mark temporary driver mem-resources
instead of global regions. This suppresses warnings if regions
overlap with a region marked as BUSY.

This was always the case for VESA/VGA/EFI framebuffer regions so
do the same for simplefb regions. The reason we do this is to
allow device handover to real GPU drivers like
i915/radeon/nouveau which get the same regions via PCI BARs.

Maybe at some point we will be able to unregister platform
devices properly during the handover. In this case the simplefb
region would get removed before the new region is created.
However, this is currently not the case and would require rather
huge changes in remove_conflicting_framebuffers(). Add the BUSY
marker now and try to eventually rewrite the handover for a next release.

Also see kernel/resource.c for more information:

  /*
   * if a resource is "BUSY", it's not a hardware resource
   * but a driver mapping of such a resource; we don't want
   * to warn for those; some drivers legitimately map only
   * partial hardware resources. (example: vesafb)
   */

This suppresses warnings like:
