ceph: fix request max size

ceph_check_caps() requests new max size only when there is Fw cap.
If we call check_max_size() while there is no Fw cap. It updates
i_wanted_max_size and calls ceph_check_caps(), but ceph_check_caps()
does nothing. Later when Fw cap is issued, we call check_max_size()
again. But i_wanted_max_size is equal to 'endoff' at this time, so
check_max_size() doesn't call ceph_check_caps() and we end up with
waiting for the new max size forever.

The fix is duplicate ceph_check_caps()'s "request max size" code in
check_max_size(), and make try_get_cap_refs() wait for the Fw cap
before retry requesting new max size.

This patch also removes the "endoff > (inode->i_size << 1)" check
in check_max_size(). It's useless because there is no corresponding
logic in ceph_check_caps().
