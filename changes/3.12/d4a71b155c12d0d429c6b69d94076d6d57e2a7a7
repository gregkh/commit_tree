ip_tunnel: Do not use stale inner_iph pointer.

While sending packet skb_cow_head() can change skb header which
invalidates inner_iph pointer to skb header. Following patch
avoid using it. Found by code inspection.

This bug was introduced by commit 0e6fbc5b6c6218 (ip_tunnels: extend
iptunnel_xmit()).
