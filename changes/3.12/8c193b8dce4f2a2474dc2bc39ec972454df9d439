ASoC: Move call to snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets() after snd_soc_dapm_auto_nc_codec_pins()

Call snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets() before the auto non-connected pins have been
marked as not connected will power the system under the assumption that those
pins are connected. Once the pins have been marked as disconnected the system
there will be an additional power run. This can cause unnecessary power
transitions. Calling snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets() only after the pins have been
marked as non-connected avoids this.
