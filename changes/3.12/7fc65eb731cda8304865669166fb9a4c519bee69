drm: Apply kref_put_mutex() optimisations to drm_gem_object_unreference_unlocked()

We can apply the same optimisation tricks as kref_put_mutex() in our
local equivalent function. However, we have a different locking semantic
(we unlock ourselves, in kref_put_mutex() the callee unlocks) so that we
can use the same callbacks for both locked and unlocked kref_put()s and
so can not simply convert to using kref_put_mutex() directly.
