Btrfs: maintain subvolume items in the UUID tree

When a new subvolume or snapshot is created, a new UUID item is added
to the UUID tree. Such items are removed when the subvolume is deleted.
The ioctl to set the received subvolume UUID is also touched and will
now also add this received UUID into the UUID tree together with the
ID of the subvolume. The latter is also done when read-only snapshots
are created which inherit all the send/receive information from the
parent subvolume.

User mode programs use the BTRFS_IOC_TREE_SEARCH ioctl to search and
read in the UUID tree.
