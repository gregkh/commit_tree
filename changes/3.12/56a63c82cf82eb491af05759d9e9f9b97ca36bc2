NFC: pn533: Store the correct frame size (normal vs ext)

The extended information frame are sent by PN533 to exchange frames
larger than 255 bytes. These extended frame are very close from the
standard ones except for the header size length. On each incoming
frame, we set the correct header length, and we do that only for the
standard pn533 chipsets as the acr122 does not seem to support extended
frames properly.
