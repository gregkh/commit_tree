Btrfs: create the uuid tree on remount rw

Users have been complaining of the uuid tree stuff warning that there is no uuid
root when trying to do snapshot operations.  This is because if you mount -o ro
we will not create the uuid tree.  But then if you mount -o rw,remount we will
still not create it and then any subsequent snapshot/subvol operations you try
to do will fail gloriously.  Fix this by creating the uuid_root on remount rw if
it was not already there.  Thanks,
