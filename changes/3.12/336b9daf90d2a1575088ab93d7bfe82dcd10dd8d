Revert "usb: pl2303: remove 500000 baud from the list of standard baud rates"

This reverts commit b9208c721ce736125fe58d398319513a27850fd8.

Revert all of the pl2303 changes that went into 3.12-rc1 and -rc2 as
they cause regressions on some versions of the chip.  This will all be
revisited for later kernel versions when we can figure out how to handle
this in a way that does not break working devices.
