[media] tda10071: change firmware download condition

Reading firmware status register to detect whether firmware is
running or not didn't worked 100% reliably. That register was
likely set by firmware itself which means it could not contain
reasonable values until firmware is up and running. Usually it
just worked as some garbage value was returned accidentally but it
appears that in some cases returned garbage value was 0x00 which
was considered "firmware is up and running" by the driver and
firmware loading was skipped leaving device to non-working state.
Fix problem by removing unreliable check and let the driver keep
count whether firmware is loaded or not.
