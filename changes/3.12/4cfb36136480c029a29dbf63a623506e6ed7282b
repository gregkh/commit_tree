arm64: add support for kernel mode NEON

Add <asm/neon.h> containing kernel_neon_begin/kernel_neon_end function
declarations and corresponding definitions in fpsimd.c

These are needed to wrap uses of NEON in kernel mode. The names are
identical to the ones used in arm/ so code using intrinsics or
vectorized by GCC can be shared between arm and arm64.
