bonding: convert to list API and replace bond's custom list

This patch aims to remove struct bonding's first_slave and struct
slave's next and prev pointers, and replace them with the standard Linux
list API. The old macros are converted to list API as well and some new
primitives are available now. The checks if there're slaves that used
slave_cnt have been replaced by the list_empty macro.
Also a few small style fixes, changing longest -> shortest line in local
variable declarations, leaving an empty line before return and removing
unnecessary brackets.
This is the first step to gradual RCU conversion.
