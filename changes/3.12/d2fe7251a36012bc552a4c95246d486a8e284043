ACPI / scan: Drop unnecessary label from acpi_create_platform_device()

The create_dev label in acpi_create_platform_device() is not
necessary, because the if statement causing the jump to it to
happen may be rearranged to avoid that jump.

Rework the code accordingly (no functional changes should result
drom that).
