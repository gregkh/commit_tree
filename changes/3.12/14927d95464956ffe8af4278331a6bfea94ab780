Btrfs: insert orphan roots into fs radix tree

Now we don't drop all the deleted snapshots/subvolumes before the space
balance. It means we have to relocate the space which is held by the dead
snapshots/subvolumes. So we must into them into fs radix tree, or we would
forget to commit the change of them when doing transaction commit, and it
would corrupt the metadata.
