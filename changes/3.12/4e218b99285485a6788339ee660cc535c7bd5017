ARM: debug: move PL01X debug include into arch/arm/include/debug/

Now that the PL01X debug include can mostly stand alone without
requiring platforms to provide any macros, move it into the debug
directory so it can be directly included.  This allows us to get rid of
a lot of debug-macros include files.

The autodetect case for Versatile Express and the ux500 are left alone;
these are more complicated implementations.
