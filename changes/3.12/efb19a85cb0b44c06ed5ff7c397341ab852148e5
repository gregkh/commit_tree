clk: samsung: exynos4: Register PLL rate tables for Exynos4x12

This patch adds rate tables for PLLs that can be reconfigured at runtime
for Exynos4x12 SoCs. Provided tables contain PLL coefficients for
input clock of 24 MHz and so are registered only in this case. MPLL does
not need runtime reconfiguration and so table for it is not provided.
