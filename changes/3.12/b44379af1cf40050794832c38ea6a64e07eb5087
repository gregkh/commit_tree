nohz_full: Add Kconfig parameter for scalable detection of all-idle state

At least one CPU must keep the scheduling-clock tick running for
timekeeping purposes whenever there is a non-idle CPU.  However, with
the new nohz_full adaptive-idle machinery, it is difficult to distinguish
between all CPUs really being idle as opposed to all non-idle CPUs being
in adaptive-ticks mode.  This commit therefore adds a Kconfig parameter
as a first step towards enabling a scalable detection of full-system
idle state.
