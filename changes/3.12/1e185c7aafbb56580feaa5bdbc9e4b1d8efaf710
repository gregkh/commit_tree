pwm: pxa: Use module_platform_driver

Commit 76abbdde2d95a3807d0dc6bf9f84d03d0dbd4f3d

    pwm: Add sysfs interface

causes a kernel oops due to a null pointer dereference on PXA platforms.
This happens because the class added by the patch is registered in a
subsys_initcall (initcall4), but the pxa pwm driver is registered in
arch_initcall (initcall3). If the class is not registered before the
driver probe function runs, the oops occurs in device_add() when the
uninitialized pointers in struct class are dereferenced.  I don't see a
reason that the driver must be an arch_initcall, so this patch makes it
a regular module_platform_driver (initcall6), preventing the oops.
