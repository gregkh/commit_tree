xen-netback: switch to NAPI + kthread 1:1 model

This patch implements 1:1 model netback. NAPI and kthread are utilized
to do the weight-lifting job:

- NAPI is used for guest side TX (host side RX)
- kthread is used for guest side RX (host side TX)

Xenvif and xen_netbk are made into one structure to reduce code size.

This model provides better scheduling fairness among vifs. It is also
prerequisite for implementing multiqueue for Xen netback.
