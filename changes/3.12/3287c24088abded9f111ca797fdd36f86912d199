pinctrl: utils : add support to pass config type in generic util APIs

Add support to pass the config type like GROUP or PIN when using
the utils or generic pin configuration APIs. This will make the
APIs more generic.

Added additional inline APIs such that it can be use directly as
callback for the pinctrl_ops.

Changes from V1:
- Remove separate implementation for pins and group for
  pinctrl_utils_dt_free_map and improve this function
  to support both i.e. PINS and GROUPs.
