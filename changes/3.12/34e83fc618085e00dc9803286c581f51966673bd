aio: reqs_active -> reqs_available

The number of outstanding kiocbs is one of the few shared things left that
has to be touched for every kiocb - it'd be nice to make it percpu.

We can make it per cpu by treating it like an allocation problem: we have
a maximum number of kiocbs that can be outstanding (i.e.  slots) - then we
just allocate and free slots, and we know how to write per cpu allocators.

So as prep work for that, we convert reqs_active to reqs_available.
