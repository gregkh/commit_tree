scripts/kallsyms: filter symbols not in kernel address space

This patch uses CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET to filter symbols which
are not in kernel address space because these symbols are
generally for generating code purpose and can't be run at
kernel mode, so we needn't keep them in /proc/kallsyms.

For example, on ARM there are some symbols which may be
linked in relocatable code section, then perf can't parse
symbols any more from /proc/kallsyms, this patch fixes the
problem (introduced b9b32bf70f2fb710b07c94e13afbc729afe221da)
