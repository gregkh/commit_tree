ath9k: Fix regression in LNA diversity

The commit "ath9k: Optimize LNA check" tried
to use the "rs_firstaggr" flag to optimize the LNA
combining algorithm when processing subframes in
an A-MPDU. This doesn't appear to work well in practice,
so revert it and use the old method of relying on
"rs_moreaggr".
