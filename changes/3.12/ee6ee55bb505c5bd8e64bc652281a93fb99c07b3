KVM: s390: fix task size check

The gmap_map_segment function uses PGDIR_SIZE in the check for the
maximum address in the tasks address space. This incorrectly limits
the amount of memory usable for a kvm guest to 4TB. The correct limit
is (1UL << 53). As the TASK_SIZE has different values (4TB vs 8PB)
dependent on the existance of the fourth page table level, create
a new define 'TASK_MAX_SIZE' for (1UL << 53).
