ext4: isolate ext4_extents.h file

After applied the commit (4a092d73), we have reduced the number of
source files that need to #include ext4_extents.h.  But we can do
better.

This commit defines ext4_zeroout_es() in extents.c and move
EXT_MAX_BLOCKS into ext4.h in order not to include ext4_extents.h in
indirect.c and ioctl.c.  Meanwhile we just need to include this file in
extent_status.c when ES_AGGRESSIVE_TEST is defined.  Otherwise, this
commit removes a duplicated declaration in trace/events/ext4.h.

After applied this patch, we just need to include ext4_extents.h file
in {super,migrate,move_extents,extents}.c, and it is easy for us to
define a new extent disk layout.
