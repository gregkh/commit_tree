xfs: kill xfs_vnodeops.[ch]

Now we have xfs_inode.c for holding kernel-only XFS inode
operations, move all the inode operations from xfs_vnodeops.c to
this new file as it holds another set of kernel-only inode
operations. The name of this file traces back to the days of Irix
and it's vnodes which we don't have anymore.

Essentially this move consolidates the inode locking functions
and a bunch of XFS inode operations into the one file. Eventually
the high level functions will be merged into the VFS interface
functions in xfs_iops.c.

This leaves only internal preallocation, EOF block manipulation and
hole punching functions in vnodeops.c. Move these to xfs_bmap_util.c
where we are already consolidating various in-kernel physical extent
manipulation and querying functions.
