powerpc: Remove ksp_limit on ppc64

We've been keeping that field in thread_struct for a while, it contains
the "limit" of the current stack pointer and is meant to be used for
detecting stack overflows.

It has a few problems however:

 - First, it was never actually *used* on 64-bit. Set and updated but
not actually exploited

 - When switching stack to/from irq and softirq stacks, it's update
is racy unless we hard disable interrupts, which is costly. This
is fine on 32-bit as we don't soft-disable there but not on 64-bit.

Thus rather than fixing 2 in order to implement 1 in some hypothetical
future, let's remove the code completely from 64-bit. In order to avoid
a clutter of ifdef's, we remove the updates from C code completely
during interrupt stack switching, and instead maintain it from the
asm helper that is used to do the stack switching in the first place.
