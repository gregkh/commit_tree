PCI: Simplify pcie_bus_configure_settings() interface

Based on a patch by Jon Mason (see URL below).

All users of pcie_bus_configure_settings() pass arguments of the form
"bus, bus->self->pcie_mpss".  The "mpss" argument is redundant since we
can easily look it up internally.  In addition, all callers check
"bus->self" for NULL, which we can also do internally.

This patch simplifies the interface and the callers.  No functional change.
