ext4: mark group corrupt on group descriptor checksum

If the group descriptor fails validation, mark the whole blockgroup
corrupt so that the inode/block allocators skip this group.  The
previous approach takes the risk of writing to a damaged group
descriptor; hopefully it was never the case that the [ib]bitmap fields
pointed to another valid block and got dirtied, since the memset would
fill the page with 1s.
