userns:  Kill nsown_capable it makes the wrong thing easy

nsown_capable is a special case of ns_capable essentially for just CAP_SETUID and
CAP_SETGID.  For the existing users it doesn't noticably simplify things and
from the suggested patches I have seen it encourages people to do the wrong
thing.  So remove nsown_capable.
