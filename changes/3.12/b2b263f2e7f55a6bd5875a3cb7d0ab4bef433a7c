mtd: nandsim: Staticize local symbols

These local symbols are used only in this file.
Fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/mtd/nand/nandsim.c:1436:5: warning: symbol 'do_read_error' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/mtd/nand/nandsim.c:1448:6: warning: symbol 'do_bit_flips' was not declared. Should it be static?
