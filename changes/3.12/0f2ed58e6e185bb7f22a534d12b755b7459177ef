iwlwifi: mvm: Change AM->PSM timeout for EAPOL frames

Currently after sending EAPOL frame FW transition to power saving mode
within 10 or 100 msec (as specified by power table command). According
to new requirement this timeout for a specific EAPOL frame must be
controlled by the driver by setting tx_pm_timeout field of TX_CMD to 2
(PM_FRAME_ENUM_MGMT). This value corresponds to 32 msec timeout.
