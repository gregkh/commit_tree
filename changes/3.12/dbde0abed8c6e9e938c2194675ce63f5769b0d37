ext4: fix type declaration of ext4_validate_block_bitmap

The block_group parameter to ext4_validate_block_bitmap is both used
as a ext4_group_t inside the function and the same type is passed in
by all callers.  We might as well use the typedef consistently instead
of open-coding the 'unsigned int'.
