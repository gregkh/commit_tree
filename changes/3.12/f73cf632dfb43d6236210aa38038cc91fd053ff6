hwmon: (nct6775) Allocate attributes dynamically from templates

Static attribute allocation is large and very repetitive.
Allocate attributes and attribute groups dynamically instead.
This reduces the size of the driver source by more than 600 lines,
and object size by more than 20k (more than 30%).
