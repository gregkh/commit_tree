KVM: nVMX: Set segment infomation of L1 when L2 exits

When L2 exits to L1, segment infomations of L1 are not set correctly.
According to Intel SDM 27.5.2(Loading Host Segment and Descriptor
Table Registers), segment base/limit/access right of L1 should be
set to some designed value when L2 exits to L1. This patch fixes
this.
