kmemcg: don't allocate extra memory for root memcg_cache_params

The memcg_cache_params structure contains the common part and the union,
which represents two different types of data: one for root cashes and
another for child caches.

The size of child data is fixed.  The size of the memcg_caches array is
calculated in runtime.

Currently the size of memcg_cache_params for root caches is calculated
incorrectly, because it includes the size of parameters for child caches.

ssize_t size = memcg_caches_array_size(num_groups);
size *= sizeof(void *);

size += sizeof(struct memcg_cache_params);

v2: Fix a typo in calculations
