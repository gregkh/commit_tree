fs: remove vfs_follow_link

For a long time no filesystem has been using vfs_follow_link, and as seen
by recent filesystem submissions any new use is accidental as well.

Remove vfs_follow_link, document the replacement in
Documentation/filesystems/porting and also rename __vfs_follow_link
to match its only caller better.
