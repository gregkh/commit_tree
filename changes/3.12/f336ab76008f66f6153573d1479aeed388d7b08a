drm: move dev data clearing from drm_setup to lastclose

We kzalloc this structure, and for real kms devices we should never
loose track of things really.

But ums/legacy drivers rely on the drm core to clean up a bit of cruft
between lastclose and firstopen (i.e. when X is being restarted), so
keep this around. But give it a clear drm_legacy_ prefix and
conditionalize the code on !DRIVER_MODESET.
