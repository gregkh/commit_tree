regulator: core: Add helpers for multiple linear ranges

Many regulators have several linear ranges of selector with different
step sizes, for example offering better resolution at lower voltages.
Provide regulator_{map,list}_voltage_linear_range() allowing these
regulators to use generic code. To do so a table of regulator_linear_range
structs needs to be pointed to from the descriptor.

This was inspired by similar code included in a driver submission from
Chao Xie and Yi Zhang at Marvell.
