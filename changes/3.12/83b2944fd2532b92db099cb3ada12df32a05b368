mm/bounce.c: fix a regression where MS_SNAP_STABLE (stable pages snapshotting) was ignored

The "force" parameter in __blk_queue_bounce was being ignored, which
means that stable page snapshots are not always happening (on ext3).
This of course leads to DIF disks reporting checksum errors, so fix this
regression.

The regression was introduced in commit 6bc454d15004 ("bounce: Refactor
__blk_queue_bounce to not use bi_io_vec")
