xhci: add xhci_cmd_completion trace event

This patch creates a new event class, called xhci_log_event,
and defines the xhci_cmd_completion trace event used for
tracing the commands issued to xHC that generate a completion
event in the event ring.

This info can be used, later, to print, in a human readable
way, the completion status and flags as well as the command's
type and fields using the trace-cmd tool and the appropriate
plugin.

Also, a tracepoint is added in handle_cmd_completion().
