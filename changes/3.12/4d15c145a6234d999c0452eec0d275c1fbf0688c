drm/i915: Use eLLC/LLC by default when available

DRI clients really should be using MOCS to get fine grained streaming
cache controls. With that note, I *hope* that this patch doesn't improve
performance overwhelmingly, because if it does - it means there is a
problem elsewhere.

In any case, the kernel, and old userspace should get some benefit from
this, so let's do it. eLLC is always a good default, and really not
using it is the special case for MOCS.
