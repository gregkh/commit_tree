cpuidle: Rearrange code and comments in get_typical_interval()

This patch rearranges a if-return-elsif-goto-fi-return sequence into
if-return-fi-if-return-fi-goto sequence. The functionality remains the
same. Also, a lengthy comment that did not describe the functionality
in the order it occurs is split into half and top half is moved closer
to actual implementation it describes.
