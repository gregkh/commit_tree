usb: chipidea: add wait vbus lower than OTGSC_BSV before role starts

When the gadget role starts, we need to make sure the vbus is lower
than OTGSC_BSV, or there will be an vbus interrupt since we use
B_SESSION_VALID as vbus interrupt to indicate connect and disconnect.
When the host role starts, it may not be useful to wait vbus to lower
than OTGSC_BSV, but it can indicate some hardware problems like the
vbus is still higher than OTGSC_BSV after we disconnect to host some
time later (5000 milliseconds currently), which is obvious not correct.
