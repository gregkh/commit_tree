ipv4: raise IP_MAX_MTU to theoretical limit

As discussed last year [1], there is no compelling reason
to limit IPv4 MTU to 0xFFF0, while real limit is 0xFFFF

Willem raised this issue again because some of our internal
regression tests broke after lo mtu being set to 65536.

IP_MTU reports 0xFFF0, and the test attempts to send a RAW datagram of
mtu + 1 bytes, expecting the send() to fail, but it does not.

Alexey raised interesting points about TCP MSS, that should be addressed
in follow-up patches in TCP stack if needed, as someone could also set
an odd mtu anyway.
