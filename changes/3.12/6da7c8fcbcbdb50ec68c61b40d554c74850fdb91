qdisc: allow setting default queuing discipline

By default, the pfifo_fast queue discipline has been used by default
for all devices. But we have better choices now.

This patch allow setting the default queueing discipline with sysctl.
This allows easy use of better queueing disciplines on all devices
without having to use tc qdisc scripts. It is intended to allow
an easy path for distributions to make fq_codel or sfq the default
qdisc.

This patch also makes pfifo_fast more of a first class qdisc, since
it is now possible to manually override the default and explicitly
use pfifo_fast. The behavior for systems who do not use the sysctl
is unchanged, they still get pfifo_fast

Also removes leftover random # in sysctl net core.
