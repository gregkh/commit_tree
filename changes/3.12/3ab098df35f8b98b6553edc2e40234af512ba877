virtio-net: don't respond to cpu hotplug notifier if we're not ready

We're trying to re-configure the affinity unconditionally in cpu hotplug
callback. This may lead the issue during resuming from s3/s4 since

- virt queues haven't been allocated at that time.
- it's unnecessary since thaw method will re-configure the affinity.

Fix this issue by checking the config_enable and do nothing is we're not ready.

The bug were introduced by commit 8de4b2f3ae90c8fc0f17eeaab87d5a951b66ee17
(virtio-net: reset virtqueue affinity when doing cpu hotplug).
