HID: usbhid: quirk for Synaptics Large Touchccreen

BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1180881

Synaptics large touchscreen doesn't support some of the report request
while initializing. The unspoorted request will make the device unreachable,
and will lead to the following usb_submit_urb() function call timeout.
So, add the IDs into HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk.
