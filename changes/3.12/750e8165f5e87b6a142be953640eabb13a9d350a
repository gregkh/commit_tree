mm: fix BUG in __split_huge_page_pmd

Occasionally we hit the BUG_ON(pmd_trans_huge(*pmd)) at the end of
__split_huge_page_pmd(): seen when doing madvise(,,MADV_DONTNEED).

It's invalid: we don't always have down_write of mmap_sem there: a racing
do_huge_pmd_wp_page() might have copied-on-write to another huge page
before our split_huge_page() got the anon_vma lock.

Forget the BUG_ON, just go back and try again if this happens.
