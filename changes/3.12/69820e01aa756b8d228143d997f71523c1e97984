USB: OHCI: Allow runtime PM without system sleep

Since ohci-hcd supports runtime PM, the .pm field in its pci_driver
structure should be protected by CONFIG_PM rather than
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.

Without this change, OHCI controllers won't do runtime suspend if
system suspend or hibernation isn't enabled.
