x86/microcode: Correct Kconfig dependencies

I have a randconfig here which has enabled only

  CONFIG_MICROCODE=y
  CONFIG_MICROCODE_OLD_INTERFACE=y

with both

  # CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL is not set
  # CONFIG_MICROCODE_AMD is not set

off. Which makes building the microcode functionality a little
pointless. Don't do that in such cases then.
