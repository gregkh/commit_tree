ARC: SMP failed to boot due to missing IVT setup

Commit 05b016ecf5e7a "ARC: Setup Vector Table Base in early boot" moved
the Interrupt vector Table setup out of arc_init_IRQ() which is called
for all CPUs, to entry point of boot cpu only, breaking booting of others.

Fix by adding the same to entry point of non-boot CPUs too.

read_arc_build_cfg_regs() printing IVT Base Register didn't help the
casue since it prints a synthetic value if zero which is totally bogus,
so fix that to print the exact Register.

[vgupta: Remove the now stale comment from header of arc_init_IRQ and
also added the commentary for halt-on-reset]
