dmaengine: PL08x: Rework LLI handling to be less fragile

Currently memory allocated for LLIs is casted to an array of structs,
which is fragile and also limits the driver to a single, predefined LLI
layout, while there are some variants of PL08x, which have more fields
in LLI (namely PL080S with its extra CCTL2).

This patch makes LLIs a sequence of 32-bit words, which is just filled
with appropriate values in appropriate order and padded with required
amount of dummy words (currently zero, but PL080S will make better use
of this).
