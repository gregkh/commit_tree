[media] ARM: shmobile: BOCK-W: add VIN and ML86V7667 support

Add ML86V7667 platform devices on BOCK-W board, configure VIN0/1 pins, and
register VIN0/1 devices with the ML86V7667 specific platform data.
[Sergei: some macro/comment cleanup; updated the copyrights, removed duplicate
'sh_eth' driver being enabled before registering VIN1 due to a pin conflict,
removed superfluous semicolon after iclink[01]_ml86v7667' initializer.]
