bonding: Make alb learning packet interval configurable

running bonding in ALB mode requires that learning packets be sent periodically,
so that the switch knows where to send responding traffic.  However, depending
on switch configuration, there may not be any need to send traffic at the
default rate of 3 packets per second, which represents little more than wasted
data.  Allow the ALB learning packet interval to be made configurable via sysfs
