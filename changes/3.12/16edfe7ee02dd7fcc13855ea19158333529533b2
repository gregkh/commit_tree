tcp: fix no cwnd growth after timeout

In commit 0f7cc9a3 "tcp: increase throughput when reordering is high",
it only allows cwnd to increase in Open state. This mistakenly disables
slow start after timeout (CA_Loss). Moreover cwnd won't grow if the
state moves from Disorder to Open later in tcp_fastretrans_alert().

Therefore the correct logic should be to allow cwnd to grow as long
as the data is received in order in Open, Loss, or even Disorder state.
