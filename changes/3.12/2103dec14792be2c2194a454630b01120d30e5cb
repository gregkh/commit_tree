mac80211: select and adjust bitrates according to channel mode

The various components accessing the bitrates table must use consider
the used channel bandwidth to select only available rates or calculate
the bitrate correctly.

There are some rates in reduced bandwidth modes which can't be
represented as multiples of 500kbps, like 2.25 MBit/s in 5 MHz mode. The
standard suggests to round up to the next multiple of 500kbps, just do
that in mac80211 as well.
