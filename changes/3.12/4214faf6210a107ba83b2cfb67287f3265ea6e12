drm/radeon/cik: properly handle internal cp ints

The internal cp interrupts need to be enabled and
disabled at specific times in order clockgating to
work properly.  This patch changes the handling
of the CP_INT_CNTL register to respect the current
state of the internal CP interrupts when making
changes to the other interrupts in CP_INT_CNTL.
