xen-gnt: prevent adding duplicate gnt callbacks

With the current implementation, the callback in the tail of the list
can be added twice, because the check done in
gnttab_request_free_callback is bogus, callback->next can be NULL if
it is the last callback in the list. If we add the same callback twice
we end up with an infinite loop, were callback == callback->next.

Replace this check with a proper one that iterates over the list to
see if the callback has already been added.
