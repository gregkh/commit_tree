ARM: OMAP3: Fix hardware detection for omap3630 when booted with device tree

SoC family definitions at the moment are reactive to board needs
as a result, beagle-xm would matchup with ti,omap3 which invokes
omap3430_init_early instead of omap3630_init_early. Obviously, this is
the wrong behavior.

With clock node dts conversion, we get the following warnings before
system hangs as a result and 3630 based platforms fails to boot
(uart4 clocks are only present in OMAP3630 and not present in
OMAP3430):

...
omap_hwmod: uart4: cannot clk_get main_clk uart4_fck
omap_hwmod: uart4: cannot _init_clocks

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap_hwmod.c:2434

So, add specific compatiblity for 3630 to allow match for Beagle-XM
platform.
