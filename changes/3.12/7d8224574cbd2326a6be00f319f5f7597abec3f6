NVMe: Call nvme_process_cq from submission path

Since we have the queue locked, it makes sense to check if there are
any completion queue entries on the queue before we release the lock.
If there are, it may save an interrupt and reduce latency for the I/Os
that happened to complete.  This happens fairly often for some workloads.
