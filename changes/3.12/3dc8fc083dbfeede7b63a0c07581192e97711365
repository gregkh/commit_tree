HID: Use hid_parser for pre-scanning the report descriptors

The Win 8 detection is sufficiently complex to warrant use of the full
parser code, in spite of the inferred memory usage. Therefore, we can use
the existing HID parser in hid-core for hid_scan_report() by re-using the
code from hid_open_report(). hid_parser_global, hid_parser_local and
hid_parser_reserved does not have any side effects. We just need to
reimplement the MAIN_ITEM callback to have a proper parsing without side
effects.
