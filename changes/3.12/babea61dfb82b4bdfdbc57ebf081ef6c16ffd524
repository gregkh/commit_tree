drm/i915: copy fetched mode state into crtc at setup_hw time v5

We already fetch and track other state into the main CRTC and encoder
structs, and for fastboot we need to do the same with the mode and clock
data we read out.

v2: fix debug print
v3: use fastboot param around state copy
v4: set clock and flags for crtc here instead of in setup_hw_state
v5: rename function to intel_crtc_mode_from_pipe_config for consistency (Chris)
