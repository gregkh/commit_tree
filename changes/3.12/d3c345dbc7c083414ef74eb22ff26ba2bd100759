PM / hibernate: Move software_resume to late_initcall_sync

software_resume is being called after deferred_probe_initcall in
drivers base. If the probing of the device that contains the resume
image is deferred, and the system has been instructed to wait for
it to show up, this wait will occur in software_resume. This causes
a deadlock.

Move software_resume into late_initcall_sync so that it happens
after all the other late_initcalls.
