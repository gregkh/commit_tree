iio: core: implement devm_iio_device_alloc/devm_iio_device_free

Add a resource managed devm_iio_device_alloc()/devm_iio_device_free()
to automatically clean up any allocations made by IIO drivers,
thus leading to simplified IIO drivers code.

In addition, this will allow IIO drivers to use other devm_*() API
(like devm_request_irq) and don't care about the race between
iio_device_free() and the release of resources by Device core
during driver removing.
