Btrfs: cache the extent map struct when reading several pages

When we read several pages at once, we needn't get the extent map object
every time we deal with a page, and we can cache the extent map object.
So, we can reduce the search time of the extent map, and besides that, we
also can reduce the lock contention of the extent map tree.
