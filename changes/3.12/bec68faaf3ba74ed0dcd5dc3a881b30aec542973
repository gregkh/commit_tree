aio: io_cancel() no longer returns the io_event

Originally, io_event() was documented to return the io_event if
cancellation succeeded - the io_event wouldn't be delivered via the ring
buffer like it normally would.

But this isn't what the implementation was actually doing; the only
driver implementing cancellation, the usb gadget code, never returned an
io_event in its cancel function. And aio_complete() was recently changed
to no longer suppress event delivery if the kiocb had been cancelled.

This gets rid of the unused io_event argument to kiocb_cancel() and
kiocb->ki_cancel(), and changes io_cancel() to return -EINPROGRESS if
kiocb->ki_cancel() returned success.

Also tweak the refcounting in kiocb_cancel() to make more sense.
