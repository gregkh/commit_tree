gfs2: Fixes to "Implement iomap for block_map"

It turns out that commit 3974320ca6 "Implement iomap for block_map"
introduced a few bugs that trigger occasional failures with xfstest
generic/476:

In gfs2_iomap_begin, we jump to do_alloc when we determine that we are
beyond the end of the allocated metadata (height > ip->i_height).
There, we can end up calling hole_size with a metapath that doesn't
match the current metadata tree, which doesn't make sense.  After
untangling the code at do_alloc, fix this by checking if the block we
are looking for is within the range of allocated metadata.

In addition, add a BUG() in case gfs2_iomap_begin is accidentally called
for reading stuffed files: this is handled separately.  Make sure we
don't truncate iomap->length for reads beyond the end of the file; in
that case, the entire range counts as a hole.

Finally, revert to taking a bitmap write lock when doing allocations.
It's unclear why that change didn't lead to any failures during testing.
