KVM/x86: Add IBPB support

The Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) is an indirect branch
control mechanism. It keeps earlier branches from influencing
later ones.

Unlike IBRS and STIBP, IBPB does not define a new mode of operation.
It's a command that ensures predicted branch targets aren't used after
the barrier. Although IBRS and IBPB are enumerated by the same CPUID
enumeration, IBPB is very different.

IBPB helps mitigate against three potential attacks:

* Mitigate guests from being attacked by other guests.
  - This is addressed by issing IBPB when we do a guest switch.

* Mitigate attacks from guest/ring3->host/ring3.
  These would require a IBPB during context switch in host, or after
  VMEXIT. The host process has two ways to mitigate
  - Either it can be compiled with retpoline
  - If its going through context switch, and has set !dumpable then
    there is a IBPB in that path.
    (Tim's patch: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10192871)
  - The case where after a VMEXIT you return back to Qemu might make
    Qemu attackable from guest when Qemu isn't compiled with retpoline.
  There are issues reported when doing IBPB on every VMEXIT that resulted
  in some tsc calibration woes in guest.

* Mitigate guest/ring0->host/ring0 attacks.
  When host kernel is using retpoline it is safe against these attacks.
  If host kernel isn't using retpoline we might need to do a IBPB flush on
  every VMEXIT.

Even when using retpoline for indirect calls, in certain conditions 'ret'
can use the BTB on Skylake-era CPUs. There are other mitigations
available like RSB stuffing/clearing.

* IBPB is issued only for SVM during svm_free_vcpu().
  VMX has a vmclear and SVM doesn't.  Follow discussion here:

Please refer to the following spec for more details on the enumeration
and control.

[peterz: rebase and changelog rewrite]
[karahmed: - rebase
           - vmx: expose PRED_CMD if guest has it in CPUID
           - svm: only pass through IBPB if guest has it in CPUID
           - vmx: support !cpu_has_vmx_msr_bitmap()]
           - vmx: support nested]
[dwmw2: Expose CPUID bit too (AMD IBPB only for now as we lack IBRS)
        PRED_CMD is a write-only MSR]
