usb: dwc2: Fix dwc2_hsotg_core_init_disconnected()

We should call dwc2_hsotg_enqueue_setup() after properly
setting lx_state. Because it may cause error-out from
dwc2_hsotg_enqueue_setup() due to wrong value in lx_state.

Issue can be reproduced by loading driver while connected
A-Connector (start in A-HOST mode) then disconnect A-Connector
to switch to B-DEVICE.
