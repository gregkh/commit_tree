KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix compile error that occurs with some gcc versions

Some versions of gcc generate a warning that the variable "emulated"
may be used uninitialized in function kvmppc_handle_load128_by2x64().
It would be used uninitialized if kvmppc_handle_load128_by2x64 was
ever called with vcpu->arch.mmio_vmx_copy_nums == 0, but neither of
the callers ever do that, so there is no actual bug.  When gcc
generates a warning, it causes the build to fail because arch/powerpc
is compiled with -Werror.

This silences the warning by initializing "emulated" to EMULATE_DONE.
