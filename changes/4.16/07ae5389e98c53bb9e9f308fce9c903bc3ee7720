KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Fix svcpu copying with preemption enabled

When copying between the vcpu and svcpu, we may get scheduled away onto
a different host CPU which in turn means our svcpu pointer may change.

That means we need to atomically copy to and from the svcpu with preemption
disabled, so that all code around it always sees a coherent state.
