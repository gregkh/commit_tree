ovl: hash non-indexed dir by upper inode for NFS export

Non-indexed upper dirs are encoded as upper file handles. When NFS export
is enabled, hash non-indexed directory inodes by upper inode, so we can
find them in inode cache using the decoded upper inode.

When NFS export is disabled, directories are not indexed on copy up, so
hash non-indexed directory inodes by origin inode, the same hash key
that is used before copy up.
