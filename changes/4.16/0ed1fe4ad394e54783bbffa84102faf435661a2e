parisc: Check if secondary CPUs want own PDC calls

The architecture specification says (for 64-bit systems): PDC is a per
processor resource, and operating system software must be prepared to
manage separate pointers to PDCE_PROC for each processor.  The address
of PDCE_PROC for the monarch processor is stored in the Page Zero
location MEM_PDC. The address of PDCE_PROC for each non-monarch
processor is passed in gr26 when PDCE_RESET invokes OS_RENDEZ.

Currently we still use one PDC for all CPUs, but in case we face a
machine which is following the specification let's warn about it.
