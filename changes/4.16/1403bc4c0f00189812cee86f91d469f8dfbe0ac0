media: coda: fix capture TRY_FMT for YUYV with non-MB-aligned widths

Since bytesperline always fulfills VDOA width requirements, detile the
whole buffer instead of limiting to visible width. This stops TRY_FMT
from returning -EINVAL for YUYV capture buffers that are not a multiple
of 16 wide.

An alternative would be to always round up width to stride, as we report
the valid image rectange via G_SELECTION (V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_DEFAULT),
but that would require all applications to handle the compose default
rectangle properly.
