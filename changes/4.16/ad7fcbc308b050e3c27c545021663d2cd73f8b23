slimbus: qcom: Add Qualcomm Slimbus controller driver

This controller driver programs manager, interface, and framer
devices for Qualcomm's slimbus HW block.
Manager component currently implements logical address setting,
and messaging interface.
Interface device reports bus synchronization information, and framer
device clocks the bus from the time it's woken up, until clock-pause
is executed by the manager device.
