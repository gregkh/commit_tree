ibft: Deprecate pci_get_bus_and_slot()

pci_get_bus_and_slot() is restrictive such that it assumes domain=0 as
where a PCI device is present. This restricts the device drivers to be
reused for other domain numbers.

Getting ready to remove pci_get_bus_and_slot() function in favor of
pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot().

We don't search for the device in other domains than zero. This is because
on x86 platforms the BIOS executes only devices which are in domain 0.
Furthermore, the iBFT spec doesn't have a domain id field.
