drm/i915/selftests: Avoid drm_gem_handle_create under struct_mutex

Despite us reloading the module around every selftest, the lockclasses
persist and the chains used in selftesting may then dictate how we are
allowed to nest locks during runtime testing. As such we have to be just
as careful, and in particular it turns out we are not allowed to nest
dev->object_name_lock (drm_gem_handle_create) inside dev->struct_mutex.
