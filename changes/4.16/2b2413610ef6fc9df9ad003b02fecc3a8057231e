ipv6: Mark dead nexthops with appropriate flags

When a netdev is put administratively down or unregistered all the
nexthops using it as their nexthop device should be marked with the
'dead' and 'linkdown' flags.

Currently, when a route is dumped its nexthop device is tested and the
flags are set accordingly. A similar check is performed during route
lookup.

Instead, we can simply mark the nexthops based on netdev events and
avoid checking the netdev's state during route dump and lookup.
