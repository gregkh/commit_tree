drm/i915/guc: Advance over port[0] if set and not preempting

Our execlist emulation is intended to only use a maximum of 2 ports per
engine, so as to not overflow the wq. (By knowing the limits, we can
avoid having to handle the wq exhaustion.) However, upon adding
preemption, we lost the skip over the first port if set for the
non-preemption path. Restore it.
