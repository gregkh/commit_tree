IB/mlx4: Fix incorrectly releasing steerable UD QPs when have only ETH ports

Allocating steerable UD QPs depends on having at least one IB port,
while releasing those QPs does not.

As a result, when there are only ETH ports, the IB (RoCE) driver
requests releasing a qp range whose base qp is zero, with
qp count zero.

When SR-IOV is enabled, and the VF driver is running on a VM over
a hypervisor which treats such qp release calls as errors
(rather than NOPs), we see lines in the VM message log like:

 mlx4_core 0002:00:02.0: Failed to release qp range base:0 cnt:0

Fix this by adding a check for a zero count in mlx4_release_qp_range()
(which thus treats releasing 0 qps as a nop), and eliminating the
check for device managed flow steering when releasing steerable UD QPs.
(Freeing ib_uc_qpns_bitmap unconditionally is also OK, since it
remains NULL when steerable UD QPs are not allocated).
