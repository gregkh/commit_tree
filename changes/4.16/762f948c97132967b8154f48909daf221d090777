HID: asus: Add product-id for the T100TAF and T100HA keyboard docks

The T100TAF and T100HA keyboard docks have the same special keys and
custom protocol multitouch touchpad as the T100TA, but use a different
product id.

The T100TAF and T100HA both use the same product id, but the T100HA's
touchpad has a different coordinate range.

This commits adds supports for the new USB id and uses a dmi-check to
determine if we're dealing with the T100TAF or T100HA.
