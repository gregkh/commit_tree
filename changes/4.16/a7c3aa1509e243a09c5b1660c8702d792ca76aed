brcmfmac: Remove brcmf_sdiod_addrprep()

This function has become trivial enough that it may as well be pushed into
its callers, which has the side-benefit of clarifying what's going on.

Remove it, and rename brcmf_sdiod_set_sbaddr_window() to
brcmf_sdiod_set_backplane_window() as it's easier to understand.
