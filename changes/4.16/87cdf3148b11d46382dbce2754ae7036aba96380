xfrm: Verify MAC header exists before overwriting eth_hdr(skb)->h_proto

Artem Savkov reported that commit 5efec5c655dd leads to a packet loss under
IPSec configuration. It appears that his setup consists of a TUN device,
which does not have a MAC header.

Make sure MAC header exists.

Note: TUN device sets a MAC header pointer, although it does not have one.
