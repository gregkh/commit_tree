btrfs: Remove pair of bio_get/put in btrfs_schedule_bio

This code was added in 492bb6deee34 ("Btrfs: Hold a reference on bios
during submit_bio, add some extra bio checks"). However, holding a
reference on a bio is necessary only if it's going to be referenced
after the submit_bio returns and the bio is completed. In this
particular instance this is not the case so there is no need to hold
an extra reference since we directly return.
