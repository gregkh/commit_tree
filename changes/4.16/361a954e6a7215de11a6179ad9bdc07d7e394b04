e1000e: Fix queue interrupt re-raising in Other interrupt

Restores the ICS write for Rx/Tx queue interrupts which was present before
commit 16ecba59bc33 ("e1000e: Do not read ICR in Other interrupt", v4.5-rc1)
but was not restored in commit 4aea7a5c5e94
("e1000e: Avoid receiver overrun interrupt bursts", v4.15-rc1).

This re-raises the queue interrupts in case the txq or rxq bits were set in
ICR and the Other interrupt handler read and cleared ICR before the queue
interrupt was raised.
