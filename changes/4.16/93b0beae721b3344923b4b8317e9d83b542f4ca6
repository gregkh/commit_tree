pinctrl: samsung: Validate alias coming from DT

Driver uses alias from Device Tree as an index of pin controller data
array.  In case of a wrong DTB or an out-of-tree DTB, the alias could be
outside of this data array leading to out-of-bounds access.

Depending on binary and memory layout, this could be handled properly
(showing error like "samsung-pinctrl 3860000.pinctrl: driver data not
available") or could lead to exceptions.
