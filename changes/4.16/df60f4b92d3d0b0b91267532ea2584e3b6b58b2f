kconfig: Remove menu_end_entry()

menu_end_entry() is empty and completely unused as far as I can tell:

	$ git log -G menu_end_entry --oneline
	a02f057 [PATCH] kconfig: improve error handling in the parser
	1da177e Linux-2.6.12-rc2

Last one is the initial Git commit, where menu_end_entry() is empty as
well. I couldn't find anything that redefined it on Google either.

It might be a debugging helper for setting a breakpoint after each
config, menuconfig, and comment is parsed. IMO it hurts more than it
helps in that case by making the parsing code look more complicated at a
glance than it really is, and I suspect it doesn't get used much.

Tested by running the Kconfiglib test suite, which indirectly verifies
that the .config files generated by the C implementation for each
defconfig file in the kernel stays the same.
