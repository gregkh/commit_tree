fix typo in assignment of fs default overflow gid

The patch remains without practical effect since both macros carry
identical values.  Still, it might become a problem in the future if
(for whatever reason) the default overflow uid and gid differ.  The
DEFAULT_FS_OVERFLOWGID macro was previously unused.
