ALSA: aloop: Sync stale timer before release

The aloop driver tries to stop the pending timer via timer_del() in
the trigger callback and in the close callback.  The former is
correct, as it's an atomic operation, while the latter expects that
the timer gets really removed and proceeds the resource releases after
that.  But timer_del() doesn't synchronize, hence the running timer
may still access the released resources.

A similar situation can be also seen in the prepare callback after
trigger(STOP) where the prepare tries to re-initialize the things
while a timer is still running.

The problems like the above are seen indirectly in some syzkaller
reports (although it's not 100% clear whether this is the only cause,
as the race condition is quite narrow and not always easy to
trigger).

For addressing these issues, this patch adds the explicit alls of
timer_del_sync() in some places, so that the pending timer is properly
killed / synced.
