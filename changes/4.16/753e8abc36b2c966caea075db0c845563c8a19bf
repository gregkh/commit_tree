arm64: mm: fix thinko in non-global page table attribute check

The routine pgattr_change_is_safe() was extended in commit 4e6020565596
("arm64: mm: Permit transitioning from Global to Non-Global without BBM")
to permit changing the nG attribute from not set to set, but did so in a
way that inadvertently disallows such changes if other permitted attribute
changes take place at the same time. So update the code to take this into
account.
