fixdep: remove stale references to uml-config.h

uml-config.h hasn't existed in this decade (87e299e5c750 - x86, um: get
rid of uml-config.h). The few remaining UML_CONFIG instances are defined
directly in terms of their real CONFIG symbol in common-offsets.h, so
unlike when the symbols got defined via a sed script, anything that uses
UML_CONFIG_FOO now should also automatically pick up a dependency on
CONFIG_FOO via the normal fixdep mechanism (since common-offsets.h
should at least recursively be a dependency). Hence I believe we should
actually be able to ignore the HELLO_CONFIG_BOOM cases.
