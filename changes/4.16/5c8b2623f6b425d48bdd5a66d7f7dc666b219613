cpufreq: scpi: Fix incorrect arm_big_little config dependency

Commit 343a8d17fa8d (cpufreq: scpi: remove arm_big_little dependency)
removed the SCPI cpufreq dependency on arm_big_little cpufreq driver.
However the Kconfig entry still depends on ARM_BIG_LITTLE_CPUFREQ
which is clearly wrong.

This patch removes that unnecessary Kconfig dependency.
