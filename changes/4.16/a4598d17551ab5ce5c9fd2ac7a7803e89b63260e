drm/i915: Rename helpers used for unwinding, use macro for can_preempt

We would also like to make use of execlist_cancel_port_requests and
unwind_incomplete_requests in GuC preemption backend.
Let's rename the functions to use the correct prefixes, so that we can
simply add the declarations in the following patch.
Similar thing for applies for can_preempt, except we're introducing
HAS_LOGICAL_RING_PREEMPTION macro instad, converting other users that
were previously touching device info directly.

v2: s/intel_engine/execlists and pass execlists to unwind (Chris)
v3: use locked version for exporting, drop const qual (Chris)
