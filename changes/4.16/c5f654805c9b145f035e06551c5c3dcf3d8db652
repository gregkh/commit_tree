net: hns3: Modify the update period of packet statistics

It takes more than 200 query response messages between
driver and IMP, while updating the packet statistics.
It's too heavy for IMP to update it per second.

Extend the update period of packet statistics data from
1 second to 300 seconds(if too long, the statistics may
overflow).

As a result, we need to update it while querying with
ifconfig tool to keep the statistics data fresh.
