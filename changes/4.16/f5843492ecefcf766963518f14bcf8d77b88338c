pinctrl: imx: use struct imx_pinctrl_soc_info as a const

For some SoCs the struct imx_pinctrl_soc_info is passed through
of_device_id.data which is const. Most variables are already const
or otherwise not written. However, some fields are modified at
runtime. Move those fields to the dynamically allocated struct
imx_pinctrl.
