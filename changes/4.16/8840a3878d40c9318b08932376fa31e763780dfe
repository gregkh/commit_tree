drm/amdgpu: retry init if it fails due to exclusive mode timeout (v3)

The exclusive mode has real-time limitation in reality, such like being
done in 300ms. It's easy observed if running many VF/VMs in single host
with heavy CPU workload.

If we find the init fails due to exclusive mode timeout, try it again.

v2:
 - rewrite the condition for readable value.

v3:
 - fix typo, add comments for sleep
