xfrm: reuse uncached_list to track xdsts

In early time, when freeing a xdst, it would be inserted into
dst_garbage.list first. Then if it's refcnt was still held
somewhere, later it would be put into dst_busy_list in
dst_gc_task().

When one dev was being unregistered, the dev of these dsts in
dst_busy_list would be set with loopback_dev and put this dev.
So that this dev's removal wouldn't get blocked, and avoid the
kmsg warning:

  kernel:unregister_netdevice: waiting for veth0 to become \
  free. Usage count = 2

However after Commit 52df157f17e5 ("xfrm: take refcnt of dst
when creating struct xfrm_dst bundle"), the xdst will not be
freed with dst gc, and this warning happens.

To fix it, we need to find these xdsts that are still held by
others when removing the dev, and free xdst's dev and set it
with loopback_dev.

But unfortunately after flow_cache for xfrm was deleted, no
list tracks them anymore. So we need to save these xdsts
somewhere to release the xdst's dev later.

To make this easier, this patch is to reuse uncached_list to
track xdsts, so that the dev refcnt can be released in the
event NETDEV_UNREGISTER process of fib_netdev_notifier.

Thanks to Florian, we could move forward this fix quickly.
