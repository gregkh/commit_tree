mlxsw: core: Make counter index allocated inside the action append

So far, the caller of mlxsw_afa_block_append_counter needed to allocate
counter index by hand. Benefit from the previously introduced resource
infra and counter_index_get/put callbacks, and allocate the counter
index in place where it is needed, inside the action append function.
