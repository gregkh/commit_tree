mm: memcontrol: implement lruvec stat functions on top of each other

The implementation of the lruvec stat functions and their variants for
accounting through a page, or accounting from a preemptible context, are
mostly identical and needlessly repetitive.

Implement the lruvec_page functions by looking up the page's lruvec and
then using the lruvec function.

Implement the functions for preemptible contexts by disabling preemption
before calling the atomic context functions.
