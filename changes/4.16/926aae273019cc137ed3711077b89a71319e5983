RDMA/vmw_pvrdma: Add UAR SRQ macros in ABI header file

Support for SRQs were added in the vmw_pvrdma userlevel library
before two necessary macros were added into the kernel ABI header
file. Add the two UAR SRQ macros that are required by the userlevel
library so that the library can rely on the kernel ABI header file
for these SRQ macro definitions.
