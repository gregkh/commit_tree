net: make skb_gso_*_seglen functions private

They're very hard to use properly as they do not consider the
GSO_BY_FRAGS case. Code should use skb_gso_validate_network_len
and skb_gso_validate_mac_len as they do consider this case.

Make the seglen functions static, which stops people using them
outside of skbuff.c
