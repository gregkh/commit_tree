netfilter: add generic flow table infrastructure

This patch defines the API to interact with flow tables, this allows to
add, delete and lookup for entries in the flow table. This also adds the
generic garbage code that removes entries that have expired, ie. no
traffic has been seen for a while.

Users of the flow table infrastructure can delete entries via
flow_offload_dead(), which sets the dying bit, this signals the garbage
collector to release an entry from user context.
