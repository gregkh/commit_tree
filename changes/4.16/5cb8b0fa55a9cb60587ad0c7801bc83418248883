ARM: dts: Move most of logicpd-som-lv-37xx-devkit.dts to logicpd-som-lv-baseboard.dtsi

The Development kits consist of a SOM connected to a baseboard.  Moving most
of the devkit files to baseboard allow us to re-use much of the contents in
preparation for using it on the OMAP35xx varation of the same kit.
