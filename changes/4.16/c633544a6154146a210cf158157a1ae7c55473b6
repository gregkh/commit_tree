xtensa: add support for KASAN

Cover kernel addresses above 0x90000000 by the shadow map. Enable
HAVE_ARCH_KASAN when MMU is enabled. Provide kasan_early_init that fills
shadow map with writable copies of kasan_zero_page. Call
kasan_early_init right after mmu initialization in the setup_arch.
Provide kasan_init that allocates proper shadow map pages from the
memblock and puts these pages into the shadow map for addresses from
VMALLOC area to the end of KSEG. Call kasan_init right after memblock
initialization. Don't use KASAN for the boot code, MMU and KASAN
initialization and page fault handler. Make kernel stack size 4 times
larger when KASAN is enabled to avoid stack overflows.
GCC 7.3, 8 or newer is required to build the xtensa kernel with KASAN.
