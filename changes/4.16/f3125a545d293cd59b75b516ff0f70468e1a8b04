drm/tinydrm: Update ILI9225 compatible string

This updates the compatible string for a no-name LCD panel to
"vot,v220hf01a-t", "ilitek,ili9225".

The original bindings were the generic "ilitek,ili9225-2.2in-176x220"
because I could not find a datasheet. However, after some more research,
I finally found one, so the actual vendor and model name are now known.

This previous bindings have not made it to the mainline kernel yet, so
this is not breaking backwards compatibility.
