xprtrdma: Remove usage of "mw"

Clean up: struct rpcrdma_mw was named after Memory Windows, but
xprtrdma no longer supports a Memory Window registration mode.
Rename rpcrdma_mw and its fields to reduce confusion and make
the code more sensible to read.

Renaming "mw" was suggested by Tom Talpey, the author of the
original xprtrdma implementation. It's a good idea, but I haven't
done this until now because it's a huge diffstat for no benefit
other than code readability.

However, I'm about to introduce static trace points that expose
a few of xprtrdma's internal data structures. They should make sense
in the trace report, and it's reasonable to treat trace points as a
kernel API contract which might be difficult to change later.

While I'm churning things up, two additional changes:
- rename variables unhelpfully called "r" to "mr", to improve code
  clarity, and
- rename the MR-related helper functions using the form
  "rpcrdma_mr_<verb>", to be consistent with other areas of the
  code.
