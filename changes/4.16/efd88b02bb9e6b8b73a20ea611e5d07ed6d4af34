rcu: Add comment giving debug strategy for double call_rcu()

The following statement has for some reason proven non-intuitive:

	WARN_ON_ONCE(rcu_segcblist_empty(&rdp->cblist) != (count == 0));

This commit therefore adds a comment that states that this warning
usually triggers in response to a double call_rcu(), which is sort
of like a double free.  The comment also suggests building with
CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_RCU_HEAD=y to track down the double call_rcu().
