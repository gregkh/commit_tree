scsi: libsas: shut down the PHY if events reached the threshold

If the PHY burst too many events, we will alloc a lot of events for the
worker. This may leads to memory exhaustion.

Dan Williams suggested to shut down the PHY if the events reached the
threshold, because in this case the PHY may have gone into some
erroneous state. Users can re-enable the PHY by sysfs if they want.

We cannot use the fixed memory pool because if we run out of events, the
shut down event and loss of signal event will lost too. The events still
need to be allocated and processed in this case.
