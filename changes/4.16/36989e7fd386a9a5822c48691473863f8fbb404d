KVM: arm/arm64: Convert kvm_host_cpu_state to a static per-cpu allocation

kvm_host_cpu_state is a per-cpu allocation made from kvm_arch_init()
used to store the host EL1 registers when KVM switches to a guest.

Make it easier for ASM to generate pointers into this per-cpu memory
by making it a static allocation.
