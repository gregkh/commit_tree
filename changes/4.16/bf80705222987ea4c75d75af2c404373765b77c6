ARM: OMAP2+: Move all omap_hwmod_sysc_fields to omap_hwmod_common_data.c

We want to be able to eventually allocate these dynamically with the
data for omap_hwmod_class_sysconfig coming from dts.

Note that omap_hwmod_sysc_type_smartreflex is the same as the older
omap36xx_sr_sysc_fields, so let's use the earlier omap36xx_sr_sysc_fields
instead.
