scsi: aacraid: Do not remove offlined devices

As part of the recovery process, the drivers removes offline devices (
done by the kernel) and then tries to add them back in the rescan code.
Removing the device is like taking a sledgehammer to a nail.

Set the device as running if it is marked offline.
