drm/i915: Set fake_vma.size as well as fake_vma.node.size for capture

When capturing the bo, we allocate an error object with an array of
min(vma->size, vma->node.size) pages, plus a bit for compression overhead.
However, when creating the fake vma to describe the bo, only one of the
sizes was filled in, resulting in a too small array. Through my and CI
testing, this was sufficient for the mostly empty NULL context as
it compressed well (or the out-of-bounds access simply didn't cause an
issue). However, in real workloads on Cannonlake, we were overflowing
that array and causing havoc with the random memory corruption.
