drm/i915/guc: Clear terminated attribute bit on GuC preemption context

If GuC firmware performs an engine reset while that engine had a
preemption pending, it will set the terminated attribute bit on our
preemption stage descriptor. GuC firmware retains all pending work
items for a high-priority GuC client, unlike the normal-priority GuC
client where work items are dropped. It wants to make sure the preempt-
to-idle work doesn't run when scheduling resumes, and uses this bit to
inform its scheduler and presumably us as well. Our job is to clear it
for the next preemption after reset, otherwise that and future
preemptions will never complete. We'll just clear it every time.
