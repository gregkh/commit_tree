IB/mlx4: Add support to RSS hash for inner headers

Support RSS hash for inner headers according to a new flag,
MLX4_IB_RX_HASH_INNER provided by the vendor channel.

In case the flag is set, RSS hash will be done on the inner headers of
VXLAN packets (which are encapsulated).
Non-encapsulated packets will be hashed according to the outer headers.
