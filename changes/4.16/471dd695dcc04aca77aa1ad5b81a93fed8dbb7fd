media: dvb-frontends/stv0910: remove unneeded check/call to get_if_freq

The result (if any) isn't used anywhere besides being assigned to a local
variable (and the only current companion stv6111 doesn't even implement
get_if_frequency()), thus remove the ptr check and the call, and also
remove the now unused iffreq variable.
