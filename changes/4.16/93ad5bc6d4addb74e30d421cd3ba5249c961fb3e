proc: rearrange args

Rearrange args for smaller code.

lookup revolves around memcmp() which gets len 3rd arg, so propagate
length as 3rd arg.

readdir and lookup add additional arg to VFS ->readdir and ->lookup, so
better add it to the end.

Space savings on x86_64:

	add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/2 up/down: 0/-18 (-18)
	Function                                     old     new   delta
	proc_readdir                                  22      13      -9
	proc_lookup                                   18       9      -9

proc_match() is smaller if not inlined, I promise!
