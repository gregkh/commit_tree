tools headers: Sync x86's cpufeatures.h

The changes in dd84441a7971 ("x86/speculation: Use IBRS if available
before calling into firmware") don't need any kind of special treatment
in the current tools/perf/ codebase, so just update the copy to get rid
of the perf build warning:

  BUILD:   Doing 'make -j4' parallel build
  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h'
