ssb: make SSB a menuconfig to ease disabling it all

No need to get into the submenu to disable all SSB-related
config entries.

This makes it easier to disable all SSB config options
without entering the submenu. It will also enable one
to see that en/dis-abled state from the outside menu.

This is only intended to change menuconfig UI, not change
the config dependencies.
