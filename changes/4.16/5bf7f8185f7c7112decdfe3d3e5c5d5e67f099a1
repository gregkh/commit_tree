net/sched: fix idr leak in the error path of tcf_act_police_init()

tcf_act_police_init() can fail after the idr has been successfully
reserved (e.g., qdisc_get_rtab() may return NULL). When this happens,
subsequent attempts to configure a police rule using the same idr value
systematiclly fail with -ENOSPC:

 # tc action add action police rate 1000 burst 1000 drop index 100
 RTNETLINK answers: Cannot allocate memory
 We have an error talking to the kernel
 # tc action add action police rate 1000 burst 1000 drop index 100
 RTNETLINK answers: No space left on device

 # tc action add action police rate 1000 burst 1000 drop index 100

 ...

Fix this in the error path of tcf_act_police_init(), calling
tcf_idr_release() in place of tcf_idr_cleanup().
