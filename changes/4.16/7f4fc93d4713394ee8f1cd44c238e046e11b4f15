bcache: return attach error when no cache set exist

I attach a back-end device to a cache set, and the cache set is not
registered yet, this back-end device did not attach successfully, and no
error returned:
[root]# echo 87859280-fec6-4bcc-20df7ca8f86b > /sys/block/sde/bcache/attach
[root]#

In sysfs_attach(), the return value "v" is initialized to "size" in
the beginning, and if no cache set exist in bch_cache_sets, the "v" value
would not change any more, and return to sysfs, sysfs regard it as success
since the "size" is a positive number.

This patch fixes this issue by assigning "v" with "-ENOENT" in the
initialization.
