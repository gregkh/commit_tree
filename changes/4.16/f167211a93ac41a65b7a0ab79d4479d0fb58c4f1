arm64: entry: Reword comment about post_ttbr_update_workaround

We don't fully understand the Cavium ThunderX erratum, but it appears
that mapping the kernel as nG can lead to horrible consequences such as
attempting to execute userspace from kernel context. Since kpti isn't
enabled for these CPUs anyway, simplify the comment justifying the lack
of post_ttbr_update_workaround in the exception trampoline.
