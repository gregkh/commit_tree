bpf: fix bpf_skb_adjust_net/bpf_skb_proto_xlat to deal with gso sctp skbs

SCTP GSO skbs have a gso_size of GSO_BY_FRAGS, so any sort of
unconditionally mangling of that will result in nonsense value
and would corrupt the skb later on.

Therefore, i) add two helpers skb_increase_gso_size() and
skb_decrease_gso_size() that would throw a one time warning and
bail out for such skbs and ii) refuse and return early with an
error in those BPF helpers that are affected. We do need to bail
out as early as possible from there before any changes on the
skb have been performed.
