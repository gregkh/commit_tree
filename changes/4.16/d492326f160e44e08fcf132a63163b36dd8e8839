perf tests: Set evlist of test__backward_ring_buffer() to !overwrite

Setting overwrite in perf_evlist__mmap() is meaningless because the
event in this evlist is already have 'overwrite' postfix and goes to
backward ring buffer automatically. Pass 'false' to perf_evlist__mmap()
to make it similar to others.
