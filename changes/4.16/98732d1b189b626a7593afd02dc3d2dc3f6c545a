KVM: arm/arm64: fix HYP ID map extension to 52 bits

Commit fa2a8445b1d3 incorrectly masks the index of the HYP ID map pgd
entry, causing a non-VHE kernel to hang during boot. This happens when
VA_BITS=48 and the ID map text is in 52-bit physical memory. In this
case we don't need an extra table level but need more entries in the
top-level table, so we need to map into hyp_pgd and need to use
__kvm_idmap_ptrs_per_pgd to mask in the extra bits. However,
__create_hyp_mappings currently masks by PTRS_PER_PGD instead.

Fix it so that we always use __kvm_idmap_ptrs_per_pgd for the HYP ID
map. This ensures that we use the larger mask for the top-level ID map
table when it has more entries. In all other cases, PTRS_PER_PGD is used
as normal.
