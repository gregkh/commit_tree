platform/x86: Add Acer Wireless Radio Control driver

New Acer laptops in 2018 will have a separate ACPI device for
notifications from the airplane mode hotkey. The device name in
the DSDT is SMKB and its ACPI _HID is 10251229.

For these models, when the airplane mode hotkey (Fn+F3) pressed,
a query 0x02 is started in the Embedded Controller, and all this
query does is a notify SMKB with the value 0x80.

        Scope (_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC0)
        {
                (...)
                Method (_Q02, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Qxx: EC Query
                {
                    HKEV (0x2, One)
		    Notify (SMKB, 0x80)	// Status Change
                }
        }
