net_sch: red: Fix the new offload indication

Update the offload flag, TCQ_F_OFFLOADED, in each dump call (and ignore
the offloading function return value in relation to this flag).
This is done because a qdisc is being initialized, and therefore offloaded
before being grafted. Since the ability of the driver to offload the qdisc
depends on its location, a qdisc can be offloaded and un-offloaded by graft
calls, that doesn't effect the qdisc itself.
