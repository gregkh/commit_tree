btrfs: clean up btrfs_dev_stat_inc usage

btrfs_end_bio() is using btrfs_dev_stat_inc() and then
btrfs_dev_stat_print_on_error() separately instead use
btrfs_dev_stat_inc_and_print() directly.

As of now there isn't any bio in btrfs which is - a non-empty write and
also the REQ_PREFLUSH flag is set. So in actual the condition

   if (bio->bi_opf & REQ_PREFLUSH)

is never true in btrfs_end_bio(), and so there won't be any redundant
error log by using btrfs_dev_stat_inc_and_print() separately one for
write and another for flush.

This consolidation will help to add the device critical error handles in
the function btrfs_dev_stat_inc_and_print() and which can be renamed as
needed.
