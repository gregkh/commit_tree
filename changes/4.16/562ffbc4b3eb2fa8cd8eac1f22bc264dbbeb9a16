mlxsw: spectrum: qdiscs: Add an ops struct

Qdisc struct have the Qdisc_class_ops struct.
This patch introduces the similar ops struct for the mlxsw_sp_qdisc_ops
struct. It allows better readability as well as code reusability for the
common parts of some functions like destroy.
The first operations to be added are the statistics getters.
