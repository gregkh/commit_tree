mmc: block: blk-mq: Stop using legacy recovery

There are only a few things the recovery needs to do. Primarily, it just
needs to:
	Determine the number of bytes transferred
	Get the card back to transfer state
	Determine whether to retry

There are also a couple of additional features:
	Reset the card before the last retry
	Read one sector at a time

The legacy code spent much effort analyzing command errors, but commands
fail fast, so it is simpler just to give all command errors the same number
of retries.
