nvme_fc: rework sqsize handling

Corrected four outstanding issues in the transport around sqsize.

1: Create Connection LS is sending the 1's-based sqsize, should be
sending the 0's-based value.

2: allocation of hw queue is using the 0's-base size. It should be
using the 1's-based value.

3: normalization of ctrl.sqsize by MQES is using MQES+1 (1's-based
value). It should be MQES (0's-based value).

4: Missing clause to ensure queue_count not larger than ctrl->sqsize.

Corrected by:
Clean up routines that pass queue size around. The queue size value is
the actual count (1's-based) value and determined from ctrl->sqsize + 1.

Routines that send 0's-based value adapt from queue size.

Sset ctrl->sqsize properly for MQES.

Added clause to nsure queue_count not larger than ctrl->sqsize + 1.
