x86/apic: Install an empty physflat_init_apic_ldr

As the comment already stated, there is no need for setting up LDR (and
DFR) in physflat mode as it remains unused (see SDM, 10.6.2.1).
flat_init_apic_ldr only served as a placeholder for a nop operation so
far, causing no harm.

That will change when running over the Jailhouse hypervisor. Here we
must not touch LDR in a way that destroys the mapping originally set up
by the Linux root cell. Jailhouse enforces this setting in order to
efficiently validate any IPI requests sent by a cell.

Avoid a needless clash caused by flat_init_apic_ldr by installing a true
nop handler.
