blk-throttle: track read and write request individually

In mixed read/write workload on SSD, write latency is much lower than
read. But now we only track and record read latency and then use it as
threshold base for both read and write io latency accounting. As a
result, write io latency will always be considered as good and
bad_bio_cnt is much smaller than 20% of bio_cnt. That is to mean, the
tg to be checked will be treated as idle most of the time and still let
others dispatch more ios, even it is truly running under low limit and
wants its low limit to be guaranteed, which is not we expected in fact.
So track read and write request individually, which can bring more
precise latency control for low limit idle detection.
