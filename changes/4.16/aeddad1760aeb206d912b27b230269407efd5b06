ocxl: Add AFU interrupt support

Add user APIs through ioctl to allocate, free, and be notified of an
AFU interrupt.

For opencapi, an AFU can trigger an interrupt on the host by sending a
specific command targeting a 64-bit object handle. On POWER9, this is
implemented by mapping a special page in the address space of a
process and a write to that page will trigger an interrupt.
