i2c: mpc: fix PORDEVSR2 mask for MPC8533/44

According to the reference manuals for the corresponding SoCs, SEC
frequency ratio configuration is indicated by bit 26 of the POR Device
Status Register 2. Consequently, SEC_CFG bit should be tested by mask 0x20,
not 0x80. Testing the wrong bit leads to selection of wrong I2C clock
prescaler on those SoCs.
