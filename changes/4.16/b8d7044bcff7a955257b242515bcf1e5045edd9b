x86/mm: add a function to check if a pfn is UC/UC-/WC

Check whether the PAT memory type of a pfn cannot be overridden by
MTRR UC memory type, i.e. the PAT memory type is UC, UC- or WC. This
function will be used by KVM to distinguish MMIO pfns and give them
UC memory type in the EPT page tables (on Intel processors, EPT
memory types work like MTRRs).
