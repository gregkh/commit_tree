ath9k_htc: Add a sanity check in ath9k_htc_ampdu_action()

Smatch generates a warning here:

    drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_drv_main.c:1688 ath9k_htc_ampdu_action()
    error: buffer overflow 'ista->tid_state' 8 <= 15

I don't know if it's a real bug or not but the other paths through this
function all ensure that "tid" is less than ATH9K_HTC_MAX_TID (8) so
checking here makes things more consistent.
