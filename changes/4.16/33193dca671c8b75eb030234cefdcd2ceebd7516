ALSA: usb-audio: Add a quirk for Nura's first gen headset

The capture interface does not work, and the playback interface
actually supports only 48kHz unlike what is advertised (44.1, 32, 22,
16, 8).

The only unknown here is if there are other devices that use the same
product ID, but given that this ID is currently unknown, I would assume
it is specially allocated for the nura headset.
