blockdev: Avoid two active bdev inodes for one device

When blkdev_open() races with device removal and creation it can happen
that unhashed bdev inode gets associated with newly created gendisk
like:

CPU0					CPU1
blkdev_open()
  bdev = bd_acquire()
					del_gendisk()
					  bdev_unhash_inode(bdev);
					remove device
					create new device with the same number
  __blkdev_get()
    disk = get_gendisk()
      - gets reference to gendisk of the new device

Now another blkdev_open() will not find original 'bdev' as it got
unhashed, create a new one and associate it with the same 'disk' at
which point problems start as we have two independent page caches for
one device.

Fix the problem by verifying that the bdev inode didn't get unhashed
before we acquired gendisk reference. That way we make sure gendisk can
get associated only with visible bdev inodes.
