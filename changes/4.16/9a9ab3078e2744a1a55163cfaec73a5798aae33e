MIPS: generic: Fix machine compatible matching

We now have a platform (Ranchu) in the "generic" platform which matches
based on the FDT compatible string using mips_machine_is_compatible(),
however that function doesn't stop at a blank struct
of_device_id::compatible as that is an array in the struct, not a
pointer to a string.

Fix the loop completion to check the first byte of the compatible array
rather than the address of the compatible array in the struct.
