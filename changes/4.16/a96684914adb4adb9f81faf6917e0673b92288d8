phylib: add reset after clk enable support

Some PHYs need the refclk to be a continuous clock. Therefore they don't
allow turning it off and on again during operation. Nonetheless such a
clock switching is performed by some ETH drivers (namely FEC [1]) for
power saving reasons. An example for an affected PHY is the
SMSC/Microchip LAN8720 in "REF_CLK In Mode".

In order to provide a uniform method to overcome this problem this patch
adds a new phy_driver flag (PHY_RST_AFTER_CLK_EN) and corresponding
function phy_reset_after_clk_enable() to the phylib. These should be
used to trigger reset of the PHY after the refclk is switched on again.
