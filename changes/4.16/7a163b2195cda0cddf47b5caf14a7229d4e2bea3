unify {de,}mangle_poll(), get rid of kernel-side POLL...

except, again, POLLFREE and POLL_BUSY_LOOP.

With this, we finally get to the promised end result:

 - POLL{IN,OUT,...} are plain integers and *not* in __poll_t, so any
   stray instances of ->poll() still using those will be caught by
   sparse.

 - eventpoll.c and select.c warning-free wrt __poll_t

 - no more kernel-side definitions of POLL... - userland ones are
   visible through the entire kernel (and used pretty much only for
   mangle/demangle)

 - same behavior as after the first series (i.e. sparc et.al. epoll(2)
   working correctly).
