x86/asm: Move 'status' from thread_struct to thread_info

The TS_COMPAT bit is very hot and is accessed from code paths that mostly
also touch thread_info::flags.  Move it into struct thread_info to improve
cache locality.

The only reason it was in thread_struct is that there was a brief period
during which arch-specific fields were not allowed in struct thread_info.

Linus suggested further changing:

  ti->status &= ~(TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED);

to:

  if (unlikely(ti->status & (TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED)))
          ti->status &= ~(TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED);

on the theory that frequently dirtying the cacheline even in pure 64-bit
code that never needs to modify status hurts performance.  That could be a
reasonable followup patch, but I suspect it matters less on top of this
patch.
