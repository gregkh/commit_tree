powerpc/64: Don't trace irqs-off at interrupt return to soft-disabled context

When an interrupt is returning to a soft-disabled context (which can
happen for non-maskable interrupts or synchronous interrupts), it goes
through the motions of soft-disabling again, including calling
TRACE_DISABLE_INTS (i.e., trace_hardirqs_off()).

This is not necessary, because we must already be soft-disabled in the
interrupt context, it also may be causing crashes in the irq tracing
code to re-enter as an nmi. Replace it with a warning to ensure that
soft-interrupts are still disabled.
