arm64: entry: Add exception trampoline page for exceptions from EL0

To allow unmapping of the kernel whilst running at EL0, we need to
point the exception vectors at an entry trampoline that can map/unmap
the kernel on entry/exit respectively.

This patch adds the trampoline page, although it is not yet plugged
into the vector table and is therefore unused.
