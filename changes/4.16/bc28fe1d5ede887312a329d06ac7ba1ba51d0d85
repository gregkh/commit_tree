kconfig: Don't leak 'option' arguments during parsing

The following strings would leak before this change:

	- option env="LEAKED"
	- option defconfig_list="LEAKED"

These come in the form of T_WORD tokens and are always allocated on the
heap in zconf.l. Free them.

Summary from Valgrind on 'menuconfig' (ARCH=x86) before the fix:

	LEAK SUMMARY:
	   definitely lost: 344,616 bytes in 14,355 blocks
	   ...

Summary after the fix:

	LEAK SUMMARY:
	   definitely lost: 344,568 bytes in 14,352 blocks
	   ...
