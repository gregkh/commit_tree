xen/grant-table: Use put_page instead of free_page

The page given to gnttab_end_foreign_access() to free could be a
compound page so use put_page() instead of free_page() since it can
handle both compound and single pages correctly.

This bug was discovered when migrating a Xen VM with several VIFs and
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled. It hits a BUG usually after fewer than 10
iterations. All netfront devices disconnect from the backend during a
suspend/resume and this will call gnttab_end_foreign_access() if a
netfront queue has an outstanding skb. The mismatch between calling
get_page() and free_page() on a compound page causes a reference
counting error which is detected when DEBUG_VM is enabled.
