trace: reenable preemption if we modify the ip

Things got moved around between the original bpf_override_return patches
and the final version, and now the ftrace kprobe dispatcher assumes if
you modified the ip that you also enabled preemption.  Make a comment of
this and enable preemption, this fixes the lockdep splat that happened
when using this feature.
