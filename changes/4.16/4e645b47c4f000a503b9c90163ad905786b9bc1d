netfilter: core: make nf_unregister_net_hooks simple wrapper again

This reverts commit d3ad2c17b4047
("netfilter: core: batch nf_unregister_net_hooks synchronize_net calls").

Nothing wrong with it.  However, followup patch will delay freeing of hooks
with call_rcu, so all synchronize_net() calls become obsolete and there
is no need anymore for this batching.

This revert causes a temporary performance degradation when destroying
network namespace, but its resolved with the upcoming call_rcu conversion.
