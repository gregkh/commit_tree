ACPI: APEI: call into AER handling regardless of severity

Currently the GHES code only calls into the AER driver for
recoverable type errors. This is incorrect because errors of
other severities do not get logged by the AER driver and do not
get exposed to user space via the AER trace event. So, call
into the AER driver for PCIe errors regardless of the severity
