s390/qeth: lock read device while queueing next buffer

For calling ccw_device_start(), issue_next_read() needs to hold the
device's ccwlock.
This is satisfied for the IRQ handler path (where qeth_irq() gets called
under the ccwlock), but we need explicit locking for the initial call by
the MPC initialization.
