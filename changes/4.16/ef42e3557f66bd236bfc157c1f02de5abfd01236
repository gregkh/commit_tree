ASoC: simple-card: Pass 'reg' property in the examples

Since unit addresses are passed to simple-audio-card,dai-link a
corresponding 'reg' property is needed, otherwise dtc complains
(when building with W=1) in case someone copies the bindings example
into a real dts file:

Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /sound-digital/simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 has a unit name, but no reg property

Improve the example by passing the correct 'reg' properties.
