xtensa: extract init_kio

KIO region placement may be specified in the device tree, that's why
it's initialized with the rest of MMU after the early_init_devtree. In
order to support KASAN the MMU must be initialized earlier.
Separate KIO initialization from the rest of MMU initialization.
Reinitialize KIO if its location is specified in the device tree.
