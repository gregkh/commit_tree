clk: qcom: Add APCS clock controller support

Add a driver for the APCS clock controller. It is part of the APCS
hardware block, which among other things implements also a combined
mux and half integer divider functionality. It can choose between a
fixed-rate clock or the dedicated APCS (A53) PLL. The source and the
divider can be set both at the same time.

This is required for enabling CPU frequency scaling on MSM8916-based
platforms.
