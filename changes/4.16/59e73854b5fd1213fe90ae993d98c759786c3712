component: add debugfs support

Currently there is no information in any vfs about which devices
a master component consists of, what makes debugging hard if
one of the component devices fails to register.

Add 'device_component' directory to debugfs. Create a new file for each
component master, when it has been added. Remove it on a master
deletion. Show a list of devices required by the given master and their
status (registered or not). This provides an easy way to check, which
device has failed to register if the given master device is not
available in the system.
