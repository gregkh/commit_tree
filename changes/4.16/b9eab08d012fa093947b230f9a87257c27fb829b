powerpc/modules: Don't try to restore r2 after a sibling call

When attempting to load a livepatch module, I got the following error:

  module_64: patch_module: Expect noop after relocate, got 3c820000

The error was triggered by the following code in
unregister_netdevice_queue():

  14c:   00 00 00 48     b       14c <unregister_netdevice_queue+0x14c>
                         14c: R_PPC64_REL24      net_set_todo
  150:   00 00 82 3c     addis   r4,r2,0

GCC didn't insert a nop after the branch to net_set_todo() because it's
a sibling call, so it never returns.  The nop isn't needed after the
branch in that case.
