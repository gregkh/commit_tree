pipe, sysctl: remove pipe_proc_fn()

pipe_proc_fn() is no longer needed, as it only calls through to
proc_dopipe_max_size().  Just put proc_dopipe_max_size() in the ctl_table
entry directly, and remove the unneeded EXPORT_SYMBOL() and the ENOSYS
stub for it.

(The reason the ENOSYS stub isn't needed is that the pipe-max-size
ctl_table entry is located directly in 'kern_table' rather than being
registered separately.  Therefore, the entry is already only defined when
the kernel is built with sysctl support.)
