KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make sure we don't re-enter guest without XIVE loaded

This fixes a bug where it is possible to enter a guest on a POWER9
system without having the XIVE (interrupt controller) context loaded.
This can happen because we unload the XIVE context from the CPU
before doing the real-mode handling for machine checks.  After the
real-mode handler runs, it is possible that we re-enter the guest
via a fast path which does not load the XIVE context.

To fix this, we move the unloading of the XIVE context to come after
the real-mode machine check handler is called.
