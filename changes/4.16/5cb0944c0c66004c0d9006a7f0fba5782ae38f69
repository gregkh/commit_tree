KVM: introduce kvm_arch_vcpu_async_ioctl

After the vcpu_load/vcpu_put pushdown, the handling of asynchronous VCPU
ioctl is already much clearer in that it is obvious that they bypass
vcpu_load and vcpu_put.

However, it is still not perfect in that the different state of the VCPU
mutex is still hidden in the caller.  Separate those ioctls into a new
function kvm_arch_vcpu_async_ioctl that returns -ENOIOCTLCMD for more
"traditional" synchronous ioctls.
