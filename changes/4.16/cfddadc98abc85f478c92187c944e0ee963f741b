drm/i915: Perform a central cdclk state sanity check

WARN if the cdclk state doesn't match what we expect after programming.
And let's remove the WARN from bdw_set_cdclk() that's trying to achieve
the same thing in a more limite fashion.

Also take the opportunity to refactor the code to use a common function
for dumping out a cdclk state.
