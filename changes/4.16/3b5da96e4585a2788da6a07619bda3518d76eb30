gfs2: Fixes to "Implement iomap for block_map" (2)

It turns out that commit 3229c18c0d6b2 'Fixes to "Implement iomap for
block_map"' introduced another bug in gfs2_iomap_begin that can cause
gfs2_block_map to set bh->b_size of an actual buffer to 0.  This can
lead to arbitrary incorrect behavior including crashes or disk
corruption.  Revert the incorrect part of that commit.
