bcache: fix for data collapse after re-attaching an attached device

back-end device sdm has already attached a cache_set with ID
f67ebe1f-f8bc-4d73-bfe5-9dc88607f119, then try to attach with
another cache set, and it returns with an error:
[root]# cd /sys/block/sdm/bcache
[root]# echo 5ccd0a63-148e-48b8-afa2-aca9cbd6279f > attach
-bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

After that, execute a command to modify the label of bcache
device:
[root]# echo data_disk1 > label

Then we reboot the system, when the system power on, the back-end
device can not attach to cache_set, a messages show in the log:
Feb  5 12:05:52 ceph152 kernel: [922385.508498] bcache:
bch_cached_dev_attach() couldn't find uuid for sdm in set

In sysfs_attach(), dc->sb.set_uuid was assigned to the value
which input through sysfs, no matter whether it is success
or not in bch_cached_dev_attach(). For example, If the back-end
device has already attached to an cache set, bch_cached_dev_attach()
would fail, but dc->sb.set_uuid was changed. Then modify the
label of bcache device, it will call bch_write_bdev_super(),
which would write the dc->sb.set_uuid to the super block, so we
record a wrong cache set ID in the super block, after the system
reboot, the cache set couldn't find the uuid of the back-end
device, so the bcache device couldn't exist and use any more.

In this patch, we don't assigned cache set ID to dc->sb.set_uuid
in sysfs_attach() directly, but input it into bch_cached_dev_attach(),
and assigned dc->sb.set_uuid to the cache set ID after the back-end
device attached to the cache set successful.
