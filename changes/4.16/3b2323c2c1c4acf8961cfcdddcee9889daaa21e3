perf bench futex: Use cpumaps

It was reported that the whole futex bench breaks when dealing with
non-contiguously numbered cpus.

$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
$ ./perf bench futex all
 perf: pthread_create: Operation not permitted
 Run summary [PID 14934]: 7 threads, each ....

James had implemented an approach with cpumaps that use an in house
flavor. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I've redone the patch such
that we use the perf's util/cpumap.c interface instead.

Applies to all futex benchmarks.
