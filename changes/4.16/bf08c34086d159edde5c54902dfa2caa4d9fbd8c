net: dsa: Move padding into Broadcom tagger

Instead of having the different master network device drivers
potentially used by DSA/Broadcom tags, move the padding necessary for
the switches to accept short packets where it makes most sense: within
tag_brcm.c. This avoids multiplying the number of similar commits to
e.g: bgmac, bcmsysport, etc.
