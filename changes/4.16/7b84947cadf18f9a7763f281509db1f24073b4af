powerpc: shifted-by-one hidx value

0xf is considered invalid hidx value. It indicates absence of a backing
HPTE. A PTE is initialized to 0xf either
a) when it is new it is newly allocated to hold 4k-backing-HPTE
	or
b) Any time it gets demoted to a 4k-backing-HPTE

This patch shifts the representation by one-modulo-0xf; i.e hidx 0 is
represented as 1, 1 as 2,... , and 0xf as 0. This convention lets us
initialize the secondary-part of the PTE to all zeroes. PTEs are anyway
zero'd when allocated. We do not have to zero them again; thus saving on
the initialization.
