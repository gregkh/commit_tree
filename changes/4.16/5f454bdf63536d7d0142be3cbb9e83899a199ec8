platform/chrome: cros_ec_lpc: Register the driver if ACPI entry is missing.

Commit 12278dc7c572 ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_lpc: Add support for
GOOG004 ACPI device") added support when the firmware reports the ACPI
device, there are some firmwares though that doesn't report this device
but have it. In such cases we need to instantiate the driver explicitly
if it is not instantiated through ACPI.
