strparser: Fix sign of err codes

strp_parser_err is called with a negative code everywhere, which then
calls abort_parser with a negative code.  strp_msg_timeout calls
abort_parser directly with a positive code.  Negate ETIMEDOUT
to match signed-ness of other calls.

The default abort_parser callback, strp_abort_strp, sets
sk->sk_err to err.  Also negate the error here so sk_err always
holds a positive value, as the rest of the net code expects.  Currently
a negative sk_err can result in endless loops, or user code that
thinks it actually sent/received err bytes.

Found while testing net/tls_sw recv path.
