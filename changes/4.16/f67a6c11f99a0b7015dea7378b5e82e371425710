gpiolib: acpi: Assign polarity when call acpi_populate_gpio_lookup()

There is no need, since we preserve firmware settings, to override
polarity for GpioInt() resources.

While Documentation/gpio-properties.txt refers to any from GpioIo() /
GpioInt() resources, the active_low flag has been introduced to fill the
gap only for GpioIo() which lacks of that information.

Moreover, in case of GpioInt() existed solution was broken anyway, it
overrides only in one direction, i.e. from 0 to 1, otherwise it would be
still 1 as defined in the resource macro.

So, move the assignment to a right place and forbid to (semi-)override
polarity for GpioInt() type of resources.
