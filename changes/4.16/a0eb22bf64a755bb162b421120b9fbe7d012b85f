rcu: Reduce dyntick-idle state space

Both extended-quiescent-state entry and exit first update the nesting
counter and then adjust the dyntick-idle state.  This means that there
are four states: (1) Both nesting and dyntick idle indicate idle,
(2) Nesting indicates idle but dyntick idle does not, (3) Nesting indicates
non-idle and dyntick idle does not, and (4) Both nesting and dyntick
idle indicate non-idle.  This commit simplifies the state space by
eliminating #3, reversing the order of updates on exit from extended
quiescent state.
