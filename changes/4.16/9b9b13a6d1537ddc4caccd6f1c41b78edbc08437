KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Keep XIVE escalation interrupt masked unless ceded

This works on top of the single escalation support. When in single
escalation, with this change, we will keep the escalation interrupt
disabled unless the VCPU is in H_CEDE (idle). In any other case, we
know the VCPU will be rescheduled and thus there is no need to take
escalation interrupts in the host whenever a guest interrupt fires.
