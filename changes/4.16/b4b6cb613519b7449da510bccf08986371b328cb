Revert "block: blk-merge: try to make front segments in full size"

This reverts commit a2d37968d784363842f87820a21e106741d28004.

If max segment size isn't 512-aligned, this patch won't work well.

Also once multipage bvec is enabled, adjacent bvecs won't be physically
contiguous if page is added via bio_add_page(), so we don't need this
kind of complicated logic.
