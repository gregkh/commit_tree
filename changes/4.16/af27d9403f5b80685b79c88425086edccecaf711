mm: hide a #warning for COMPILE_TEST

We get a warning about some slow configurations in randconfig kernels:

  mm/memory.c:83:2: error: #warning Unfortunate NUMA and NUMA Balancing config, growing page-frame for last_cpupid. [-Werror=cpp]

The warning is reasonable by itself, but gets in the way of randconfig
build testing, so I'm hiding it whenever CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST is set.

The warning was added in 2013 in commit 75980e97dacc ("mm: fold
page->_last_nid into page->flags where possible").
