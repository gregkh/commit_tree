media: cx25840: describe standard for 0b1100 value in AFD_FMT_STAT bits

A 0b1100 value in 4 LSBs of "General Status 1" register (AFD_FMT_STAT) has
known meaning for CX2584x-series chips - it means that a SECAM signal is
currently detected by the chip.

Use this opportunity to also fix wrong binary values that were present
as comments attached to some entries in an array where
chip register -> V4L2 standard mappings are stored.
