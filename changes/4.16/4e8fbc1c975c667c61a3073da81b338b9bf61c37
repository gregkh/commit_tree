perf env: Adopt perf_env__arch() from the annotate code

And use it in the libunwind case, with both passing a valid perf_env to
extract the arch to be normalized from and passing NULL with the same
semantic as in the annotate code: to get it from uname() uts.machine.

Now the code to generate per arch errno translation tables (int/string)
can use it to decode perf.data files recorded in a different arch than
that where 'perf trace' (or any other analysis tool) runs.
