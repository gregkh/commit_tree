ARM: 8744/1: don't discard memblock for kexec

Discarding the memblock arrays usually works, but causes problems
with kexec, as pointed out by this kbuild warning:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x7c60): Section mismatch in reference from the function machine_kexec_prepare() to the function .meminit.text:memblock_is_region_memory()

This lets us keep the memblock structures around whenever kexec
is enabled, but otherwise still drops them.
