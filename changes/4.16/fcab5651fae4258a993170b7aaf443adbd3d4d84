ARM: dts: r8a7790: Correct critical CPU temperature

The R-Car H2 hardware manual states that Tc = –40°C to +105°C. The
thermal sensor has an accuracy of ±5°C and there can be a temperature
difference of 1 or 2 degrees between Tjmax and the thermal sensor due
to the location of the latter.

This means that 95°C is a safer value to use.
