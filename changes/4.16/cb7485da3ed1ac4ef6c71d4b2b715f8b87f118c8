KVM: s390: use switch vs jump table in intercept.c

Instead of having huge jump tables for function selection,
let's use normal switch/case statements for the instruction
handlers in intercept.c We can now also get rid of
intercept_handler_t.

This allows the compiler to make the right decision depending
on the situation (e.g. avoid jump-tables for thunks).
