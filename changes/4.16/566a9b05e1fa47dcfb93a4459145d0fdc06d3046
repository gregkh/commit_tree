bus: ti-sysc: Handle module quirks based dts configuration

Let's configure few module quirks via device tree using the
properties for "ti,no-idle-on-init", "ti,no-reset-on-init"
and "ti,sysc-delay-us".

Let's also reorder the probe a bit so we have pdata available
earlier, and move the PM runtime calls to sysc_init_module()
from sysc_read_revision().
