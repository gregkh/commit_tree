scsi: libsas: notify event PORTE_BROADCAST_RCVD in sas_enable_revalidation()

There are two places queuing the disco event DISCE_REVALIDATE_DOMAIN.
One is in sas_porte_broadcast_rcvd() and uses sas_chain_event() to queue
the event. The other is in sas_enable_revalidation() and uses
sas_queue_event() to queue the event. We have diffrent work queues for
event and discovery now, so the DISCE_REVALIDATE_DOMAIN event may be
processed in both event queue and discovery queue.

Now since we do synchronous event handling, we cannot do it in discovery
queue, so have to trigger a fake broadcast event to re-trigger the
revalidation from event queue.
