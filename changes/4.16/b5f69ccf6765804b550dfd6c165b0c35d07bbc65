ixgbe: avoid bringing rings up/down as macvlans are added/removed

This change makes it so that instead of bringing rings up/down for various
we just update the netdev pointer for the Rx ring and set or clear the MAC
filter for the interface. By doing it this way we can avoid a number of
races and issues in the code as things were getting messy with the macvlan
clean-up racing with the interface clean-up to bring the rings down on
shutdown.

With this change we opt to leave the rings owned by the PF interface for
both Tx and Rx and just direct the packets once they are received to the
macvlan netdev.
