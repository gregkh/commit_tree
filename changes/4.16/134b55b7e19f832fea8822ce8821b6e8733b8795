clk: qcom: support Huayra type Alpha PLL

The Huayra type Alpha PLL  has a 16 bit alpha value, and
depending on the alpha_mode, the alpha value can be treated as
M/N value or as a twoâ€™s compliment number. This PLL supports
dynamic programming.

Since the decoding of alpha val and dynamic programming are
completely different from other Alpha PLLs we add separate
functions for Huayra PLLs.
