ovl: whiteout index when union nlink drops to zero

With NFS export feature enabled, when overlay inode nlink drops to
zero, instead of removing the index entry, replace it with a whiteout
index entry.

This is needed for NFS export in order to prevent future open by handle
from opening the lower file directly.
