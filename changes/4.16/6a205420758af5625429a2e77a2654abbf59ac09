arm64: fix ID map extension to 52 bits

Commit fa2a8445b1d3 added support for extending the ID map to 52 bits,
but accidentally dropped a required change to __cpu_uses_extended_idmap.
As a result, the kernel fails to boot when VA_BITS = 48 and the ID map
text is in 52-bit physical memory, because we reduce TCR.T0SZ to cover
the ID map, but then never set it back to VA_BITS.

Add back the change, and also clean up some double parentheses.
