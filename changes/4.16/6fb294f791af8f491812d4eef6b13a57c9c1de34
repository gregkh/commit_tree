mmc: tmio: move {tmio_}mmc_of_parse() to tmio_mmc_host_alloc()

mmc_of_parse() parses various DT properties and sets capability flags
accordingly.  However, drivers have no chance to run platform init
code depending on such flags because mmc_of_parse() is called from
tmio_mmc_host_probe().

Move mmc_of_parse() to tmio_mmc_host_alloc() so that drivers can
handle capabilities before mmc_add_host().  Move tmio_mmc_of_parse()
likewise.
