watchdog: core: make sure the watchdog worker always works

When running a command like 'chrt -f 50 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null',
the watchdog_worker fails to service the HW watchdog and the
HW watchdog fires long before the watchdog soft timeout.

At the moment, the watchdog_worker is invoked as a delayed work.
Delayed works are handled by non realtime kernel threads. The
WQ_HIGHPRI flag only increases the niceness of that threads.

This patch replaces the delayed work logic by kthread delayed work,
and sets the associated kernel task to SCHED_FIFO with the highest
priority, in order to ensure that the watchdog worker will run as
soon as possible.
