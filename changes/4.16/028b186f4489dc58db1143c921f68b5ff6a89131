efifb: Set info->fbcon_rotate_hint based on drm_get_panel_orientation_quirk

On some hardware the LCD panel is not mounted upright in the casing,
but rotated by 90 degrees. In this case we want the console to
automatically be rotated to compensate.

The drm subsys has a quirk table for this, use the
drm_get_panel_orientation_quirk function to get the panel orientation
and set info->fbcon_rotate_hint based on this, so that the fbcon console
on top of efifb gets automaticallyÂ rotated to compensate for the panel
orientation.
