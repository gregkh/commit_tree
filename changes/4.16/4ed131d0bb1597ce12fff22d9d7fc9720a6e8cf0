IB/mlx5: Expose dynamic mmap allocation

This patch exposes the option to dynamic allocates a UAR, this
functionality will be used in downstream patch in this series as
part of QP creation.

Specifically, the user space driver asks for a UAR allocation in a given
page index, upon success this UAR and its bfregs can be used as part of
QP creation by the user space driver.

To enable allocating more than 256 UARs the page index is encoded in an
extra one byte just after the command byte.
