netfilter: nf_tables: add flow table netlink frontend

This patch introduces a netlink control plane to create, delete and dump
flow tables. Flow tables are identified by name, this name is used from
rules to refer to an specific flow table. Flow tables use the rhashtable
class and a generic garbage collector to remove expired entries.

This also adds the infrastructure to add different flow table types, so
we can add one for each layer 3 protocol family.
