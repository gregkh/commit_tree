scsi: aacraid: remove redundant setting of variable c

A previous commit no longer stores the contents of c, so we now have a
situation where c is being updated but the value is never read. Clean up
the code by removing the now redundant setting of variable c.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/scsi/aacraid/aachba.c:943:3: warning: Value stored to 'c' is
never read
