MAINTAINERS: Remove Jani as drm-misc co-maintainer

I'm juggling too many things, and drm-misc maintenance is one that I
keep dropping on the floor. Admit reality and remove myself as
maintainer. This still leaves us with a nice team of three who are
actually doing the drm-misc work, while I focus on drm-intel.
