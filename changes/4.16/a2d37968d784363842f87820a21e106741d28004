block: blk-merge: try to make front segments in full size

When merging one bvec into segment, if the bvec is too big
to merge, current policy is to move the whole bvec into another
new segment.

This patchset changes the policy into trying to maximize size of
front segments, that means in above situation, part of bvec
is merged into current segment, and the remainder is put
into next segment.

This patch prepares for support multipage bvec because
it can be quite common to see this case and we should try
to make front segments in full size.
