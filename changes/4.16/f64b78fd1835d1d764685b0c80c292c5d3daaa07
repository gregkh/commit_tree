CIFS: SMBD: Implement function to receive data via RDMA receive

On the receive path, the transport maintains receive buffers and a reassembly
queue for transferring payload via RDMA recv. There is data copy in the
transport on recv when it copies the payload to upper layer.

The transport recognizes the RFC1002 header length use in the SMB
upper layer payloads in CIFS. Because this length is mainly used for TCP and
not applicable to RDMA, it is handled as a out-of-band information and is
never sent over the wire, and the trasnport behaves like TCP to upper layer
by processing and exposing the length correctly on data payloads.
