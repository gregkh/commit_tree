media: dmxdev: Fix the logic that enables DMA mmap support

Some conditions required for DVB mmap support to work are reversed.
Also, the logic is not too clear.

So, improve the logic, making it easier to be handled.

PS.: I'm pretty sure that I fixed it while testing, but, somehow,
the change got lost.
