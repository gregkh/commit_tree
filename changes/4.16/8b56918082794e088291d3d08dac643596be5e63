scsi: qla2xxx: remove redundant assignment of d

The initialization of d is redundant as this value is never read and it
is overwritten inside the subsequent for-loop.  Remove this redundant
assignment.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_gs.c:3985:29: warning: Value stored to 'd'
during its initialization is never read
