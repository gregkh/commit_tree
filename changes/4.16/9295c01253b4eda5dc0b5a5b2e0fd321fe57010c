gpio: sysfs: correct error handling on 'value' attribute read.

'value' attribute is supposed to only return 0 or 1 according to
the documentation.
With today's implementation, if gpiod_get_value_cansleep() fails
the printed 'value' is a negative value.

This patch ensures that an error is returned on read instead.
