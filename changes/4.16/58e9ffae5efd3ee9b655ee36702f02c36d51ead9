kvm: vmx: Reduce size of vmcs_field_to_offset_table

The vmcs_field_to_offset_table was a rather sparse table of short
integers with a maximum index of 0x6c16, amounting to 55342 bytes. Now
that we are considering support for multiple VMCS12 formats, it would
be unfortunate to replicate that large, sparse table. Rotating the
field encoding (as a 16-bit integer) left by 6 reduces that table to
5926 bytes.
