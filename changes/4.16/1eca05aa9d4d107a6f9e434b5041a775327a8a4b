f2fs: update inode info to inode page for new file

After checkpoint,
 1. creat a new file A ,(with dirty inode && dirty inode page && xattr info)
 2. backgroud wb write back file A inode page (without update from inode cache)
 3. fsync file A, write back inode page of file A with inode cache info
 4. sudden power off before new checkpoint

In this case, recovery process will try to recover a zero inode
page. Inline xattr flag of file A will be miss and xattr info
will be taken as blkaddr index.
