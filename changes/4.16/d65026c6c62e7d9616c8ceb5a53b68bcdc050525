vhost: validate log when IOTLB is enabled

Vq log_base is the userspace address of bitmap which has nothing to do
with IOTLB. So it needs to be validated unconditionally otherwise we
may try use 0 as log_base which may lead to pin pages that will lead
unexpected result (e.g trigger BUG_ON() in set_bit_to_user()).
