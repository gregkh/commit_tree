media: merge ir_tx_z8f0811_haup and ir_rx_z8f0811_haup i2c devices

These two devices ids are really just one device with multiple
addresses. Probing becomes much simpler if we simply fold this into
one i2c device with two address.

Note that this breaks the lirc_zilog driver, however we will teach
ir-kbd-i2c to do what lirc_zilog does in a later commit.
