staging: android: ashmem: Fix possible deadlock in ashmem_ioctl

ashmem_mutex may create a chain of dependencies like:

CPU0                                    CPU1
 mmap syscall                           ioctl syscall
 -> mmap_sem (acquired)                 -> ashmem_ioctl
 -> ashmem_mmap                            -> ashmem_mutex (acquired)
    -> ashmem_mutex (try to acquire)       -> copy_from_user
                                              -> mmap_sem (try to acquire)

There is a lock odering problem between mmap_sem and ashmem_mutex causing
a lockdep splat[1] during a syzcaller test. This patch fixes the problem
by move copy_from_user out of ashmem_mutex.
