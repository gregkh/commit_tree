x86/kexec: Make kexec (mostly) work in 5-level paging mode

Currently kexec() will crash when switching into a 5-level paging
enabled kernel.

I missed that we need to change relocate_kernel() to set CR4.LA57
flag if the kernel has 5-level paging enabled.

I avoided using #ifdef CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL here and inferred if we need to
enable 5-level paging from previous CR4 value. This way the code is
ready for boot-time switching between paging modes.

With this patch applied, in addition to kexec 4-to-4 which always worked,
we can kexec 4-to-5 and 5-to-5 - while 5-to-4 will need more work.
