drm/i915/guc: Initialize GuC before restarting engines

Now that we're handling request resubmission the same way as regular
submission (from the tasklet), we can move GuC initialization earlier,
before restarting the engines. This way, we're no longer being in the
state of flux during engine restart - we're already in user requested
submission mode.
