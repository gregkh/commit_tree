arm64: dts: marvell: armada-80x0: Fix pinctrl compatible string

When replacing the cpm by cp0 and cps by cp1 [1] not only the label and
the alias were replaced but also the compatible string which was wrong.

Due to this the pinctrl driver was no more probed.

This patch fix it by reverting this change for the pinctrl compatible
string on Armada 8K.
