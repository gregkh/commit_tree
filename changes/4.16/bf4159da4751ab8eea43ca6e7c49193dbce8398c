KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Enable use of the new XIVE "single escalation" feature

That feature, provided by Power9 DD2.0 and later, when supported
by newer OPAL versions, allows us to sacrifice a queue (priority 7)
in favor of merging all the escalation interrupts of the queues
of a single VP into a single interrupt.

This reduces the number of host interrupts used up by KVM guests
especially when those guests use multiple priorities.

It will also enable a future change to control the masking of the
escalation interrupts more precisely to avoid spurious ones.
