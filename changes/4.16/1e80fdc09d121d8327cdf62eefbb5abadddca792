KVM: SVM: Pin guest memory when SEV is active

The SEV memory encryption engine uses a tweak such that two identical
plaintext pages at different location will have different ciphertext.
So swapping or moving ciphertext of two pages will not result in
plaintext being swapped. Relocating (or migrating) physical backing
pages for a SEV guest will require some additional steps. The current SEV
key management spec does not provide commands to swap or migrate (move)
ciphertext pages. For now, we pin the guest memory registered through
KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_REG_REGION ioctl.
