drm/i915/execlists: Cache ELSP register offset

Currently on every submission, we recalculate the ELSP register offset
for the engine, after chasing the pointers to find the iomem base. Since
this is fixed for the lifetime of the driver, record the offset in the
execlists struct.

In practice the difference is negligible, it just happens to remove 27
bytes of eyesore pointer dancing from next to the hottest instruction
(which is itself due to stalling for a cache miss) in perf profiles of
the execlists_submission_tasklet().

v2: Trim off one more elsp local.
