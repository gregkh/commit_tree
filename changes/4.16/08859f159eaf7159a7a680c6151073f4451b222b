nfp: bpf: relax source operands check

The NFP normally requires the source operands to be difference addressing
modes, but we should rule out the very special NN_REG_NONE type.

There are instruction that ignores both A/B operands, for example:

  local_csr_rd

For these instructions, we might pass the same operand type, NN_REG_NONE,
for both A/B operands.

NOTE: in current NFP ISA, it is only possible for instructions with
unrestricted operands to take none operands, but in case there is new and
similar instructoin in restricted form, they would follow similar rules,
so swreg_to_restricted is updated as well.
