bpf: Sync kernel ABI header with tooling header for bpf_common.h

I recently fixed up a lot of commits that forgot to keep the tooling
headers in sync.  And then I forgot to do the same thing in commit
cb5f7334d479 ("bpf: add comments to BPF ld/ldx sizes"). Let correct
that before people notice ;-).

Lawrence did partly fix/sync this for bpf.h in commit d6d4f60c3a09
("bpf: add selftest for tcpbpf").

Fixes: cb5f7334d479 ("bpf: add comments to BPF ld/ldx sizes")
