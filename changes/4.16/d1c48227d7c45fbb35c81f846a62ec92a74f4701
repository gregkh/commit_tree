USB: serial: f81534: fix tx error on some baud rate

The F81532/534 had 4 clocksource 1.846/18.46/14.77/24MHz and baud rates
can be up to 1.5Mbits with 24MHz. But on some baud rate (384~500kps), the
TX side will send the data frame too close to treat frame error on RX
side. This patch will force all TX data frame with delay 1bit gap.
