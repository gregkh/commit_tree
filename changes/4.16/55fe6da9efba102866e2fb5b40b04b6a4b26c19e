kbuild: Handle builtin dtb file names containing hyphens

cmd_dt_S_dtb constructs the assembly source to incorporate a devicetree
FDT (that is, the .dtb file) as binary data in the kernel image. This
assembly source contains labels before and after the binary data. The
label names incorporate the file name of the corresponding .dtb file.
Hyphens are not legal characters in labels, so .dtb files built into the
kernel with hyphens in the file name result in errors like the
following:

bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g.dtb.S: Assembler messages:
bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g.dtb.S:5: Error: : no such section
bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g.dtb.S:5: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `-'
bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g.dtb.S:6: Error: unrecognized opcode `__dtb_bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g_begin:'
bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g.dtb.S:8: Error: unrecognized opcode `__dtb_bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g_end:'
bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g.dtb.S:9: Error: : no such section
bcm3368-netgear-cvg834g.dtb.S:9: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `-'

Fix this by updating cmd_dt_S_dtb to transform all hyphens from the file
name to underscores when constructing the labels.

As of v4.16-rc2, 1139 .dts files across ARM64, ARM, MIPS and PowerPC
contain hyphens in their names, but the issue only currently manifests
on Broadcom MIPS platforms, as that is the only place where such files
are built into the kernel. For example when CONFIG_DT_NETGEAR_CVG834G=y,
or on BMIPS kernels when the dtbs target is used (in the latter case it
admittedly shouldn't really build all the dtb.o files, but thats a
separate issue).
