swiotlb: refactor coherent buffer freeing

Factor out a new swiotlb_free_buffer helper that checks if an address
is allocated from the swiotlb bounce buffer, and if yes frees it.

This allows to simplify the swiotlb_free implemenation that uses
dma_direct_free to free the non-bounce buffer allocations.
