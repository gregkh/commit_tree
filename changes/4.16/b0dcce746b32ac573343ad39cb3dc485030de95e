scsi: qla2xxx: Fix abort command deadlock due to spinlock

Original code acquires hardware_lock to add Abort IOCB onto driver
request queue for processing. However, abort_command() will also acquire
hardware lock to look up sp pointer before issuing abort IOCB command
resulting into a deadlock. This patch safely removes the possible
deadlock scenario by removing extra spinlock.
