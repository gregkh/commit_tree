PCI/DPC: Make RP PIO log size check more generic

In dpc_probe(), we set dpc->rp_log_size to zero if we think the hardware
reports an invalid size.  In this case, we could have dpc->rp_extensions
set but dpc->rp_log_size == 0, and we should print the basic RP PIO
registers but not the variable-size portion.  We already checked for
dpc->rp_log_size < 4 above, so this patch is just for consistency of style.
No functional change intended.
