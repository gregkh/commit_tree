arm: dts: Remove p1010-flexcan compatible from imx series dts

The flexcan driver has been modified to check for big-endian dts
property for be read/write to flexcan registers/mb.

An exception to this rule is powerpc P1010RDB, which is always
big-endian, even if big-endian is not present in dts. This is
checked using p1010-flexcan compatible in dts.

Therefore, remove p1010-flexcan compatible from imx series dts,
as their flexcan core is little endian.
