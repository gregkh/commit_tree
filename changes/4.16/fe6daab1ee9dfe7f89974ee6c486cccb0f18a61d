x86/centaur: Mark TSC invariant

Centaur CPU has a constant frequency TSC and that TSC does not stop in
C-States. But because the corresponding TSC feature flags are not set for
that CPU, the TSC is treated as not constant frequency and assumed to stop
in C-States, which makes it an unreliable and unusable clock source.

Setting those flags tells the kernel that the TSC is usable, so it will
select it over HPET.  The effect of this is that reading time stamps (from
kernel or user space) will be faster and more efficent.
