ASoC: cs35l34: Improve two size determinations in cs35l34_i2c_probe()

Replace the specification of two data structures by pointer dereferences
as the parameter for the operator "sizeof" to make the corresponding size
determination a bit safer according to the Linux coding style convention.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
