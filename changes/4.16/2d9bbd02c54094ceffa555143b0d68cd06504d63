spi: sun6i: disable/unprepare clocks on remove

sun6i_spi_probe() uses sun6i_spi_runtime_resume() to prepare/enable
clocks, so sun6i_spi_remove() should use sun6i_spi_runtime_suspend() to
disable/unprepare them if we're not suspended.
Replacing pm_runtime_disable() by pm_runtime_force_suspend() will ensure
that sun6i_spi_runtime_suspend() is called if needed.
