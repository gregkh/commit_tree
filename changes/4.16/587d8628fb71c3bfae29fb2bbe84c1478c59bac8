platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: suppress warning about palm detection

This patch prevents the thinkpad_acpi driver from warning about 2 event
codes returned for keyboard palm-detection. No behavioral changes,
other than suppressing the warning in the kernel log. The events are
still forwarded via acpi-netlink channels.

We could, optionally, decide to forward the event through a
input-switch on the tpacpi input device. However, so far no suitable
input-code exists, and no similar drivers report such events. Hence,
leave it an acpi event for now.

Note that the event-codes are named based on empirical studies. On the
ThinkPad X1 5th Gen the sensor can be found underneath the arrow key.
