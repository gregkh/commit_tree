nvme-pci: Remap CMB SQ entries on every controller reset

The controller memory buffer is remapped into a kernel address on each
reset, but the driver was setting the submission queue base address
only on the very first queue creation. The remapped address is likely to
change after a reset, so accessing the old address will hit a kernel bug.

This patch fixes that by setting the queue's CMB base address each time
the queue is created.
