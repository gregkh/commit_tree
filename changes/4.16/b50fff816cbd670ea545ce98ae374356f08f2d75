btrfs: switch to refcount_t type for btrfs_trans_handle::use_count

The use_count is a reference counter, we can use the refcount_t type,
though we don't use the atomicity. This is not a performance critical
code and we could catch the underflows. The type is changed from long,
but the number of references will fit an int.
