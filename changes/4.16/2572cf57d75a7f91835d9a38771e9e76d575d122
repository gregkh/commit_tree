mlx5: fix mlx5_get_vector_affinity to start from completion vector 0

The consumers of this routine expects the affinity map of of vector
index relative to the first completion vector. The upper layers are
not aware of internal/private completion vectors that mlx5 allocates
for its own usage.

Hence, return the affinity map of vector index relative to the first
completion vector.
