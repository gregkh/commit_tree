xfs: refactor xfs_verifier_error and xfs_buf_ioerror

Since all verification errors also mark the buffer as having an error,
we can combine these two calls.  Later we'll add a xfs_failaddr_t
parameter to promote the idea of reporting corruption errors and the
address of the failing check to enable better debugging reports.
