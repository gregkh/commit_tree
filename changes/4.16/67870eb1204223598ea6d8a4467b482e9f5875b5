ARM: kvm: fix building with gcc-8

In banked-sr.c, we use a top-level '__asm__(".arch_extension virt")'
statement to allow compilation of a multi-CPU kernel for ARMv6
and older ARMv7-A that don't normally support access to the banked
registers.

This is considered to be a programming error by the gcc developers
and will no longer work in gcc-8, where we now get a build error:

/tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:34: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SP_usr'
/tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:41: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,ELR_hyp'
/tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:55: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SP_svc'
/tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:62: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,LR_svc'
/tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:69: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SPSR_svc'
/tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:76: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SP_abt'

Passign the '-march-armv7ve' flag to gcc works, and is ok here, because
we know the functions won't ever be called on pre-ARMv7VE machines.
Unfortunately, older compiler versions (4.8 and earlier) do not understand
that flag, so we still need to keep the asm around.

Backporting to stable kernels (4.6+) is needed to allow those to be built
with future compilers as well.
