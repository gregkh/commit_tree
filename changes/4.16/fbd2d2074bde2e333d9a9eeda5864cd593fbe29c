ovl: index all non-dir on copy up for NFS export

With the NFS export feature enabled, all non-dir are indexed on copy up.
The copy up origin inode of an indexed non-dir can be used as a unique
identifier of the overlay object.

The full index is also used for consistency verfication, like detecting
multiple non-hardlink uppers with the same 'origin' on lookup.

Directory index on copy up will be implemented by following patch.
