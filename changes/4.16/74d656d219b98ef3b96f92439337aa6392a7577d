powerpc/powernv: Add opal calls for opencapi

Add opal calls to interact with the NPU:

OPAL_NPU_SPA_SETUP: set the Shared Process Area (SPA)
The SPA is a table containing one entry (Process Element) per memory
context which can be accessed by the opencapi device.

OPAL_NPU_SPA_CLEAR_CACHE: clear the context cache
The NPU keeps a cache of recently accessed memory contexts. When a
Process Element is removed from the SPA, the cache for the link must
be cleared.

OPAL_NPU_TL_SET: configure the Transaction Layer
The Transaction Layer specification defines several templates for
messages to be exchanged on the link. During link setup, the host and
device must negotiate what templates are supported on both sides and
at what rates those messages can be sent.
