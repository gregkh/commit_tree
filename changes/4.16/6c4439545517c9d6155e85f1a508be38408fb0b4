perf record: Ignore kptr_restrict when not sampling the kernel

If we're not sampling the kernel, we shouldn't care about kptr_restrict
neither synthesize anything for assisting in resolving kernel samples,
like the reference relocation symbol or kernel modules information.

Before:

  $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
  2
  2
  $ perf record sleep 1
  WARNING: Kernel address maps (/proc/{kallsyms,modules}) are restricted,
  check /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict.

  Samples in kernel functions may not be resolved if a suitable vmlinux
  file is not found in the buildid cache or in the vmlinux path.

  Samples in kernel modules won't be resolved at all.

  If some relocation was applied (e.g. kexec) symbols may be misresolved
  even with a suitable vmlinux or kallsyms file.

  Couldn't record kernel reference relocation symbol
  Symbol resolution may be skewed if relocation was used (e.g. kexec).
  Check /proc/kallsyms permission or run as root.

  $ perf evlist -v

After:

  $ perf record sleep 1
