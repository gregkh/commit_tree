s390: Fix runtime warning about negative pgtables_bytes

When running s390 images with 'compat' processes, the following
BUG is seen repeatedly.

BUG: non-zero pgtables_bytes on freeing mm: -16384

Bisect points to commit b4e98d9ac775 ("mm: account pud page tables").
Analysis shows that init_new_context() is called with
mm->context.asce_limit set to _REGION3_SIZE. In this situation,
pgtables_bytes remains set to 0 and is not increased. The message is
displayed when the affected process dies and mm_dec_nr_puds() is called.
