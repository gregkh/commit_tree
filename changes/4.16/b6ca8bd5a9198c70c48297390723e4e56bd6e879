xfrm: Move child route linkage into xfrm_dst.

XFRM bundle child chains look like this:

	xdst1 --> xdst2 --> xdst3 --> path_dst

All of xdstN are xfrm_dst objects and xdst->u.dst.xfrm is non-NULL.
The final child pointer in the chain, here called 'path_dst', is some
other kind of route such as an ipv4 or ipv6 one.

The xfrm output path pops routes, one at a time, via the child
pointer, until we hit one which has a dst->xfrm pointer which
is NULL.

We can easily preserve the above mechanisms with child sitting
only in the xfrm_dst structure.  All children in the chain
before we break out of the xfrm_output() loop have dst->xfrm
non-NULL and are therefore xfrm_dst objects.

Since we break out of the loop when we find dst->xfrm NULL, we
will not try to dereference 'dst' as if it were an xfrm_dst.
