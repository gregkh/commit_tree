KVM: VMX: optimize shadow VMCS copying

Because all fields can be read/written with a single vmread/vmwrite on
64-bit kernels, the switch statements in copy_vmcs12_to_shadow and
copy_shadow_to_vmcs12 are unnecessary.

What I did in this patch is to copy the two parts of 64-bit fields
separately on 32-bit kernels, to keep all complicated #ifdef-ery
in init_vmcs_shadow_fields.  The disadvantage is that 64-bit fields
have to be listed separately in shadow_read_only/read_write_fields,
but those are few and we can validate the arrays when building the
VMREAD and VMWRITE bitmaps.  This saves a few hundred clock cycles
per nested vmexit.

However there is still a "switch" in vmcs_read_any and vmcs_write_any.
So, while at it, this patch reorders the fields by type, hoping that
the branch predictor appreciates it.
