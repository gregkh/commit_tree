Btrfs: add extent map selftests

We've observed that btrfs_get_extent() and merge_extent_mapping() could
return -EEXIST in several cases, and they are caused by some racy
condition, e.g dio read vs dio write, which makes the problem very tricky
to reproduce.

This adds extent map selftests in order to simulate those racy situations.
