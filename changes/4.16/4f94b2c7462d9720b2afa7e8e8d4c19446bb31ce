powerpc/8xx: Use L1 entry APG to handle _PAGE_ACCESSED for CONFIG_SWAP

When CONFIG_SWAP is set, the TLB miss handlers have to also take
into account _PAGE_ACCESSED flag. At the moment it is done by
anding _PAGE_ACCESSED into _PAGE_PRESENT using 3 instructions.

This patch uses APG for handling _PAGE_ACCESSED, allowing to
just copy _PAGE_ACCESSED bit into APG field, hence reducing the
action to a single instruction.
