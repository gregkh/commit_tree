NTB: Fix UB/bug in ntb_mw_get_align()

Simple (1 << pidx) operation causes undefined behaviour when
pidx >= 32. It must be casted to u64 to match the actual return
value of ntb_link_is_up() method, so to have all the possible
peer indexes covered and to get rid of undefined behaviour.
Additionally there are special macros in "linux/bitops.h" to perform
the bit-set-shift operations, so it's recommended to have them used
for proper bit setting.
