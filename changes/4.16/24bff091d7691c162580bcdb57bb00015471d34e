ixgbevf: use length to determine if descriptor is done

Based on:
commit 7ec0116c9131 ("igb: Use length to determine if descriptor is done")

This change makes it so that we use the length of the packet instead of the
DD status bit to determine if a new descriptor is ready to be processed.
The obvious advantage is that it cuts down on reads as we don't really even
need the DD bit if going from a 0 to a non-zero value on size is enough to
inform us that the packet has been completed.

In addition we only reset the Rx descriptor length for descriptor zero when
resetting a ring instead of having to do a memset with 0 over the entire
ring. By doing this we can save some time on initialization.
