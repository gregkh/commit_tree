llc: properly handle dev_queue_xmit() return value

llc_conn_send_pdu() pushes the skb into write queue and
calls llc_conn_send_pdus() to flush them out. However, the
status of dev_queue_xmit() is not returned to caller,
in this case, llc_conn_state_process().

llc_conn_state_process() needs hold the skb no matter
success or failure, because it still uses it after that,
therefore we should hold skb before dev_queue_xmit() when
that skb is the one being processed by llc_conn_state_process().

For other callers, they can just pass NULL and ignore
the return value as they are.
