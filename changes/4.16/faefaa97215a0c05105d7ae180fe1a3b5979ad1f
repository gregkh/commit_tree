ibmvnic: Reset long term map ID counter

When allocating RX or TX buffer pools, the driver needs to provide a
unique mapping ID to firmware for each pool. This value is assigned
using a counter which is incremented after a new pool is created. The
ID can be an integer ranging from 1-255. When migrating to a device
that requests a different number of queues, this value was not being
reset properly. As a result, after enough migrations, the counter
exceeded the upper bound and pool creation failed. This is fixed by
resetting the counter to one in this case.
