power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Do not register our psy on (some) HDMI sticks

The Intel Compute Stick (Cherry Trail version) and the Meegopad T08 HDMI
stick, both use an axp288 PMIC.  They also both have this wired up in such
a way that the detection logic in the PMIC claims that a valid battery is
present, resuling in GNOME and KDE showing a full-battery in their status
bar and power-settings, while these devices do not have a battery.

For lack of a better fix add a DMI blacklist and do not register the
axp288_fuel_gauge psy on devices on the blacklist.
