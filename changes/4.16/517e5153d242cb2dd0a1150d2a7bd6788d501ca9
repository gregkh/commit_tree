scsi: libsas: use flush_workqueue to process disco events synchronously

Now we are processing sas event and discover event in different
workqueues.  It's safe to wait the discover event done in the sas event
work. Use flush_workqueue() to insure the disco and revalidate events
processed synchronously so that the whole discover and revalidate
process will not be interrupted by other events.
