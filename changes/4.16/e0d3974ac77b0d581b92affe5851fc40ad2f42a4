bpf: offload: don't require rtnl for dev list manipulation

We don't need the RTNL lock for all operations on offload state.
We only need to hold it around ndo calls.  The device offload
initialization doesn't require it.  The soon-to-come querying
of the offload info will only need it partially.  We will also
be able to remove the waitqueue in following patches.

Use struct rw_semaphore because map offload will require sleeping
with the semaphore held for read.
