s390: fix handling of -1 in set{,fs}[gu]id16 syscalls

For some reason, the implementation of some 16-bit ID system calls
(namely, setuid16/setgid16 and setfsuid16/setfsgid16) used type cast
instead of low2highgid/low2highuid macros for converting [GU]IDs, which
led to incorrect handling of value of -1 (which ought to be considered
invalid).

Discovered by strace test suite.
