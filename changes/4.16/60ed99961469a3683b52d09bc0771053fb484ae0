extcon: axp288: Redo charger type detection a couple of seconds after probe()

The axp288 extcon code depends on other drivers to do things like mux the
data lines, enable/disable vbus based on the id-pin, etc.

Sometimes the BIOS has not set these things up correctly resulting in the
initial charger cable type detection giving a wrong result and we end up
not charging or charging at only 0.5A.

This commit starts a second charger-detection cycle a couple of seconds
after the first one finishes, giving the other drivers time to load and
do their thing.
