crypto: aead - prevent using AEADs without setting key

Similar to what was done for the hash API, update the AEAD API to track
whether each transform has been keyed, and reject encryption/decryption
if a key is needed but one hasn't been set.

This isn't quite as important as the equivalent fix for the hash API
because AEADs always require a key, so are unlikely to be used without
one.  Still, tracking the key will prevent accidental unkeyed use.
algif_aead also had to track the key anyway, so the new flag replaces
that and slightly simplifies the algif_aead implementation.
