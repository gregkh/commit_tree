scsi: hisi_sas: do link reset for some CHL_INT2 ints

We should do link reset of PHY when identify timeout or STP link timeout. They
are internal events of SOC and are notified to driver through interrupts of
CHL_INT2.

Besides, we should add an delay work to do link reset as it needs sleep. So,
this patch add an new PHY event HISI_PHYE_LINK_RESET for this.

Notes: v2 HW doesn't report the event of STP link timeout.  So, we only need
to handle event of identify timeout for v2 HW.
