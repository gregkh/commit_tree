tracing, rcu: Hide trace event rcu_nocb_wake when not used

The trace event rcu_nocb_wake is only used when CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU is
defined. But the trace event is defined regardless. As defined trace
events take up memory, it is a waste to have it defined when not used.
Surround the trace event with an #ifdef to have it only defined when it
is used.
