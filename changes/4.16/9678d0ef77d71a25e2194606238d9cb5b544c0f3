platform/x86: intel-vbtn: support panel front button

The Lenovo Helix 2 and Dell XPS 12 (9Q33) have an extra button on the
front showing a 'Windows' logo, both reporting event codes 0xC2/0xC3
on press/release. On the Dell, both press/release are distinct events
while on the Helix 2 both events are generated on release.

Tested on XPS 12, for info on the Helix 2 see:
