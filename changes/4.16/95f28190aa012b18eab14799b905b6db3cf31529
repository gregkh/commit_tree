tools include arch: Grab a copy of errno.h for arch's supported by perf

For each arch in tools/perf/arch, grab a copy of errno.h.

This is a pre-req to generate an architecture specific mapping of errno
numbers to their names.  This errno mapping can be used by perf trace to
support cross-architecture trace reports and to get rid of the
audit-libs dependency.
