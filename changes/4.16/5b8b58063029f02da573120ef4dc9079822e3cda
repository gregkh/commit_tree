rtc-opal: Fix handling of firmware error codes, prevent busy loops

According to the OPAL docs:
  skiboot-5.2.5/doc/opal-api/opal-rtc-read-3.txt
  skiboot-5.2.5/doc/opal-api/opal-rtc-write-4.txt

OPAL_HARDWARE may be returned from OPAL_RTC_READ or OPAL_RTC_WRITE and
this indicates either a transient or permanent error.

Prior to this patch, Linux was not dealing with OPAL_HARDWARE being a
permanent error particularly well, in that you could end up in a busy
loop.

This was not too hard to trigger on an AMI BMC based OpenPOWER machine
doing a continuous "ipmitool mc reset cold" to the BMC, the result of
that being that we'd get stuck in an infinite loop in
opal_get_rtc_time().

We now retry a few times before returning the error higher up the
stack.
