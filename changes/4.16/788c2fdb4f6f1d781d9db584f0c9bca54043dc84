watchdog: i6300esb: remove info message and version number

The initial info message (early in the esb_probe() function) is not very
useful and we already have a message on successful probe, which includes
device identification. If the probe fails (e.g. PCI related errors),
additional messages are printed anyway.

The version number was only used in the initial info message. Other than
that, it serves no useful purpose and it ran out of favor upstream
anyway.
