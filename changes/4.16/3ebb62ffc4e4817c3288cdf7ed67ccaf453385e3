cpu_cooling: Keep only one of_cpufreq*cooling_register() helper

of_cpufreq_cooling_register() isn't used by anyone and so can be
removed, but then we would be left with two routines:
cpufreq_cooling_register() and of_cpufreq_power_cooling_register() that
would look odd.

Remove current implementation of of_cpufreq_cooling_register() and
rename of_cpufreq_power_cooling_register() as
of_cpufreq_cooling_register(). This simplifies lots of stuff.
