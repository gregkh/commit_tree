arm64: Implement array_index_mask_nospec()

Provide an optimised, assembly implementation of array_index_mask_nospec()
for arm64 so that the compiler is not in a position to transform the code
in ways which affect its ability to inhibit speculation (e.g. by introducing
conditional branches).

This is similar to the sequence used by x86, modulo architectural differences
in the carry/borrow flags.
