cpufreq: intel_pstate: Enable HWP during system resume on CPU0

When maxcpus=1 is in the kernel command line, the BP is responsible
for re-enabling the HWP - because currently only the APs invoke
intel_pstate_hwp_enable() during their online process - which might
put the system into unstable state after resume.

Fix this by enabling the HWP explicitly on BP during resume.
