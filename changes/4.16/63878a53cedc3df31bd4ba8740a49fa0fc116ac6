perf top: Check per-event overwrite term

Per-event overwrite term is not forbidden in 'perf top', which can bring
problems. Because 'perf top' only support non-overwrite mode now.

Add new rules and check regarding to overwrite term for 'perf top'.
- All events either have same per-event term or don't have per-event
  mode setting. Otherwise, it will error out.
- Per-event overwrite term should be consistent as opts->overwrite.
  If not, updating the opts->overwrite according to per-event term.

Make it possible to support either non-overwrite or overwrite mode.
The overwrite mode is forbidden now, which will be removed when the
overwrite mode is supported later.
