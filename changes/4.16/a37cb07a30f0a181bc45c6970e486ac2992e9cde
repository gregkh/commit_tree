KVM: s390: add vcpu stat counters for many instruction

The overall instruction counter is larger than the sum of the
single counters. We should try to catch all instruction handlers
to make this match the summary counter.
Let us add sck,tb,sske,iske,rrbe,tb,tpi,tsch,lpsw,pswe....
and remove other unused ones.
