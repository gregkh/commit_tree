ocxl: Driver code for 'generic' opencapi devices

Add an ocxl driver to handle generic opencapi devices. Of course, it's
not meant to be the only opencapi driver, any device is free to
implement its own. But if a host application only needs basic services
like attaching to an opencapi adapter, have translation faults handled
or allocate AFU interrupts, it should suffice.

The AFU config space must follow the opencapi specification and use
the expected vendor/device ID to be seen by the generic driver.

The driver exposes the device AFUs as a char device in /dev/ocxl/

Note that the driver currently doesn't handle memory attached to the
opencapi device.
