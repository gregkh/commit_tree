KVM: X86: Restart the guest when insn_len is zero and SEV is enabled

On AMD platforms, under certain conditions insn_len may be zero on #NPF.
This can happen if a guest gets a page-fault on data access but the HW
table walker is not able to read the instruction page (e.g instruction
page is not present in memory).

Typically, when insn_len is zero, x86_emulate_instruction() walks the
guest page table and fetches the instruction bytes from guest memory.
When SEV is enabled, the guest memory is encrypted with guest-specific
key hence hypervisor will not able to fetch the instruction bytes.
In those cases we simply restart the guest.

I have encountered this issue when running kernbench inside the guest.
