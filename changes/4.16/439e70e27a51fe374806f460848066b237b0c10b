arm64: idmap: Use "awx" flags for .idmap.text .pushsection directives

The identity map is mapped as both writeable and executable by the
SWAPPER_MM_MMUFLAGS and this is relied upon by the kpti code to manage
a synchronisation flag. Update the .pushsection flags to reflect the
actual mapping attributes.
