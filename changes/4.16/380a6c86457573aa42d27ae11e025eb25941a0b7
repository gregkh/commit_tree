media: [RESEND] media: dvb-frontends: Add delay to Si2168 restart

On faster CPUs a delay is required after the resume command and the restart command. Without the delay, the restart command often returns -EREMOTEIO and the Si2168 does not restart.

Note that this patch fixes the same issue as https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/44304/, but I believe my udelay() fix addresses the actual problem.
