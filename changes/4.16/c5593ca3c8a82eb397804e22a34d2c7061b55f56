btrfs: switch to RCU for device traversal in btrfs_ioctl_dev_info

We don't need to use the mutex as we do not modify the devices nor the
list itself and just read some information:

does not change during device lifetime:
- devid
- uuid
- name (ie. the path)

may change in parallel to the ioctl call, but can lead only to reporting
inacurracy:
- bytes_used
- total_bytes
