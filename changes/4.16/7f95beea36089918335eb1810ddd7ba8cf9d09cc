clk: update cached phase to respect the fact when setting phase

It's found that the final phase set by driver doesn't match that of
the output from clk_summary:

dwmmc_rockchip fe310000.dwmmc: Successfully tuned phase to 346
mmc0: new ultra high speed SDR104 SDIO card at address 0001

cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary | grep sdio_sample
sdio_sample	0        1        0    50000000 0 0

It seems the cached core->phase isn't updated after the clk was
registered. So fix this issue by updating the core->phase if setting
phase successfully.
