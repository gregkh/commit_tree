rhashtable: Add rhastable_walk_peek

This function is like rhashtable_walk_next except that it only returns
the current element in the inter and does not advance the iter.

This patch also creates __rhashtable_walk_find_next. It finds the next
element in the table when the entry cached in iter is NULL or at the end
of a slot. __rhashtable_walk_find_next is called from
rhashtable_walk_next and rhastable_walk_peek.

end_of_table is an added field to the iter structure. This indicates
that the end of table was reached (walker.tbl being NULL is not a
sufficient condition for end of table).
