scsi: aacraid: Process hba and container hot plug events in single function

The hotplug handler code is duplicated for hba handling and container
handling.

Merged function to handle hba and container hot plug events into the
resolve luns functions. Added a bunch of helper functions to check the
validity of a given target and to check if bus, target is container
device.
