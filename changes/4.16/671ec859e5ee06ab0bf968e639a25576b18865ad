ALSA: seq: Process queue tempo/ppq change in a shot

The SNDRV_SEQ_IOCTL_SET_QUEUE_TEMPO ioctl sets the tempo and the ppq
in a single call, while the current implementation updates each value
one by one.  This is a bit racy, and also suboptimal from the
performance POV, as each call does re-acquire the lock and invokes
the update of ALSA timer resolution.

This patch reorganizes the code slightly so that we change both the
tempo and the ppq in a shot.  The skew value can be put into the same
lock, but this is rather a rarely used feature and completely
independent from the temp/ppq (it's evaluated only in the interrupt),
so it's left as it was.
