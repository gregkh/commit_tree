drm/i915/selftests: Don't try to queue a request with zero delay

Instead of trying to create a timer with zero delay (i.e. with expires
set to the current jiffies and not the future, an already expired
timer), execute that request immediately.

v2: Refactor list_del_init+signal into its own little function.
v3: Reorder testing so as not to immediately signal a delayed request.
