memremap: change devm_memremap_pages interface to use struct dev_pagemap

This new interface is similar to how struct device (and many others)
work. The caller initializes a 'struct dev_pagemap' as required
and calls 'devm_memremap_pages'. This allows the pagemap structure to
be embedded in another structure and thus container_of can be used. In
this way application specific members can be stored in a containing
struct.

This will be used by the P2P infrastructure and HMM could probably
be cleaned up to use it as well (instead of having it's own, similar
'hmm_devmem_pages_create' function).
