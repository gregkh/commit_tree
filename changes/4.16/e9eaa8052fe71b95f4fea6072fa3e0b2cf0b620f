arm64: mm: ignore memory above supported physical address size

When booting a kernel without 52-bit PA support (e.g. a kernel with 4k
pages) on a system with 52-bit memory, the kernel will currently try to
use the 52-bit memory and crash. Fix this by ignoring any memory higher
than what the kernel supports.
