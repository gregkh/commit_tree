autofs4: Modify autofs_wait to use current_uid() and current_gid()

The code used to do that and then I mucked with it and never quite put
the code back.  Today the code references current_cred()->uid and
current_cred()->gid which is equivalent but more wordy, and not
idiomatic.

Fixes: 069d5ac9ae0d ("autofs:  Fix automounts by using current_real_cred()->uid")
