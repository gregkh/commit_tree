mac80211: mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that in some cases I replaced "fall through on else" and
"otherwise fall through" comments with just a "fall through" comment,
which is what GCC is expecting to find.
