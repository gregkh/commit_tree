userfaultfd: convert to use anon_inode_getfd()

Nothing actually calls userfaultfd_file_create() besides the
userfaultfd() system call itself.  So simplify things by folding it into
the system call and using anon_inode_getfd() instead of
anon_inode_getfile().  Do the same in resolve_userfault_fork() as well.

This removes over 50 lines with no change in functionality.
