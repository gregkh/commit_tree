lan78xx: Set ASD in MAC_CR when EEE is enabled.

Description:
EEE does not work with lan7800 when AutoSpeed is not set.
(This can happen when EEPROM is not populated or configured incorrectly)

Root-Cause:
When EEE is enabled, the mac config register ASD is not set
i.e. in default state, causing EEE fail.

Fix:
Set the register when eeprom is not present.
