Use list_head infra-structure for buffer's log items list

Now that buffer's b_fspriv has been split, just replace the current
singly linked list of xfs_log_items, by the list_head infrastructure.

Also, remove the xfs_log_item argument from xfs_buf_resubmit_failed_buffers(),
there is no need for this argument, once the log items can be walked
through the list_head in the buffer.
