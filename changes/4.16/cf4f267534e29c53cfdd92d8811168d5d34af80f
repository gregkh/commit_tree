phylink: merge SGMII and 802.3z handling

The code handling SGMII and 802.3z is essentially the same, except that
we assume 802.3z has no PHY.  Re-organise the code such that these cases
are merged, and exclude 802.3z mode from having a PHY attached.  This
results in the same link handling behaviour as before.
