ACPI / LPIT: Export lpit_read_residency_count_address()

Export lpit_read_residency_count_address(), so that it can be used from
drivers built as module. With the recent changes, the builtin_pci
functionality of the intel_pmc_core driver is removed and now it can be
built as a module to read this exported interface to calculate the PMC base
address.
