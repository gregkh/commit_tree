block, bfq: release oom-queue ref to root group on exit

On scheduler init, a reference to the root group, and a reference to
its corresponding blkg are taken for the oom queue. Yet these
references are not released on scheduler exit, which prevents these
objects from be freed. This commit adds the missing reference
releases.
