ipv6 sit: work around bogus gcc-8 -Wrestrict warning

gcc-8 has a new warning that detects overlapping input and output arguments
in memcpy(). It triggers for sit_init_net() calling ipip6_tunnel_clone_6rd(),
which is actually correct:

net/ipv6/sit.c: In function 'sit_init_net':
net/ipv6/sit.c:192:3: error: 'memcpy' source argument is the same as destination [-Werror=restrict]

The problem here is that the logic detecting the memcpy() arguments finds them
to be the same, but the conditional that tests for the input and output of
ipip6_tunnel_clone_6rd() to be identical is not a compile-time constant.

We know that netdev_priv(t->dev) is the same as t for a tunnel device,
and comparing "dev" directly here lets the compiler figure out as well
that 'dev == sitn->fb_tunnel_dev' when called from sit_init_net(), so
it no longer warns.

This code is old, so Cc stable to make sure that we don't get the warning
for older kernels built with new gcc.
