ovl: unbless lower st_ino of unverified origin

On a malformed overlay, several redirected dirs can point to the same
dir on a lower layer. This presents a similar challenge as broken
hardlinks, because different objects in the overlay can return the same
st_ino/st_dev pair from stat(2).

For broken hardlinks, we do not provide constant st_ino on copy up to
avoid this inconsistency. When NFS export feature is enabled, apply
the same logic to files and directories with unverified lower origin.
