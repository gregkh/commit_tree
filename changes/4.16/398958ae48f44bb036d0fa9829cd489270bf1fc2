ipv6: Add support for non-equal-cost multipath

The use of hash-threshold instead of modulo-N makes it trivial to add
support for non-equal-cost multipath.

Instead of dividing the multipath hash function's output space equally
between the nexthops, each nexthop is assigned a region size which is
proportional to its weight.
