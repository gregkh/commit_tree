KVM: MMU: consider host cache mode in MMIO page check

Some reserved pages, such as those from NVDIMM DAX devices, are not
for MMIO, and can be mapped with cached memory type for better
performance. However, the above check misconceives those pages as
MMIO.  Because KVM maps MMIO pages with UC memory type, the
performance of guest accesses to those pages would be harmed.
Therefore, we check the host memory type in addition and only treat
UC/UC-/WC pages as MMIO.
