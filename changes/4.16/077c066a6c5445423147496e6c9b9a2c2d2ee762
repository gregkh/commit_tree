tools/libbpf: improve the pr_debug statements to contain section numbers

While debugging a bpf ELF loading issue, I needed to correlate the
ELF section number with the failed relocation section reference.
Thus, add section numbers/index to the pr_debug.

In debug mode, also print section that were skipped.  This helped
me identify that a section (.eh_frame) was skipped, and this was
the reason the relocation section (.rel.eh_frame) could not find
that section number.

The section numbers corresponds to the readelf tools Section Headers [Nr].
