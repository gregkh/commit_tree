net: revert "Update RFS target at poll for tcp/udp"

On multi-threaded processes, one common architecture is to have
one (or a small number of) threads polling sockets, and a
considerably larger pool of threads reading form and writing to the
sockets. When we set RPS core on tcp_poll() or udp_poll() we essentially
steer all packets of all the polled FDs to one (or small number of)
cores, creaing a bottleneck and/or RPS misprediction.

Another common architecture is to shard FDs among threads pinned
to cores. In such a setting, setting RPS core in tcp_poll() and
udp_poll() is redundant because the RFS core is correctly
set in recvmsg and sendmsg.

Thus, revert the following commit:
c3f1dbaf6e28 ("net: Update RFS target at poll for tcp/udp").
