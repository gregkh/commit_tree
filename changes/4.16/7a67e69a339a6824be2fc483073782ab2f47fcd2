vti6: Keep set MTU on link creation or change, validate it

In vti6_link_config(), if MTU is already given on link creation
or change, validate and use it instead of recomputing it. To do
that, we need to propagate the knowledge that MTU was set by
userspace all the way down to vti6_link_config().

To keep this simple, vti6_dev_init() sets the new 'keep_mtu'
argument of vti6_link_config() to true: on initialization, we
don't have convenient access to netlink attributes there, but we
will anyway check whether dev->mtu is set in vti6_link_config().
If it's non-zero, it was set to the value of the IFLA_MTU
attribute during creation. Otherwise, determine a reasonable
value.
