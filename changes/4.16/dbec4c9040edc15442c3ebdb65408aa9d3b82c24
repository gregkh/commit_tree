scsi: mpt3sas: lockless command submission

Performance improvement using block layer tag.

Curent driver gets scsiio tracker and free smid from link list and array
based tracking managed by driver.  Accessing list in main io path is
performance pentaly because of protection using spinlock
"scsi_lookup_lock".

In this patch:

1. Driver removes all link list access from main io path and
   use scmd->request->tag to get free smid.

2. Instead of holding 'struct scsiio_tracker' in its own pool
   driver can embed it into the scsi command.

Driver provides cmd_size in scsi_host_template, so that struct
scsiio_tracker is preallocated by scsi mid layer for each scsi command.
