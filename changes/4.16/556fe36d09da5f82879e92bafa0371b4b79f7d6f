drm/i915: Update watermark state correctly in sanitize_watermarks

We no longer use intel_crtc->wm.active for watermarks any more,
which was incorrect. But this uncovered a bug in sanitize_watermarks(),
which meant that we wrote the correct watermarks, but the next
update would still use the wrong hw watermarks for calculating.
This caused all further updates to fail with -EINVAL and the
log would reveal an error like the one below:

[   10.043902] [drm:ilk_validate_wm_level.part.8 [i915]] Sprite WM0 too large 56 (max 0)
[   10.043960] [drm:ilk_validate_pipe_wm [i915]] LP0 watermark invalid
[   10.044030] [drm:intel_crtc_atomic_check [i915]] No valid intermediate pipe watermarks are possible
