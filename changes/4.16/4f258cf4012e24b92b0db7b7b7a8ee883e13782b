platform/x86: have ACPI_CMPC use depends instead of select for INPUT

Drivers should not 'select' a subsystem. Instead they should depend
on it. If the subsystem is disabled, the user probably did that for
a purpose and one driver shouldn't be changing that.

This also makes all platform/x86/ drivers consistent w.r.t depending on
INPUT instead of selecting it.
