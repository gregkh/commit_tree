mm, dax: introduce pfn_t_special()

In support of removing the VM_MIXEDMAP indication from DAX VMAs,
introduce pfn_t_special() for drivers to indicate that _PAGE_SPECIAL
should be used for DAX ptes. This also helps identify drivers like
dccssblk that only want to use DAX in a read-only fashion without
get_user_pages() support.

Ideally we could delete axonram and dcssblk DAX support, but if we need
to keep it better make it explicit that axonram and dcssblk only support
a sub-set of DAX due to missing _PAGE_DEVMAP support.
