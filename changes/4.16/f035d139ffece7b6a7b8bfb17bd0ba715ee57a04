usb: dwc3: ep0: Reset TRB counter for ep0 IN

DWC3 tracks TRB counter for each ep0 direction separately. In control
read transfer completion handler, the driver needs to reset the TRB
enqueue counter for ep0 IN direction. Currently the driver only resets
the TRB counter for control OUT endpoint. Check for the data direction
and properly reset the TRB counter from correct control endpoint.
