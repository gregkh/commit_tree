scsi: qla2xxx: Fixup locking for session deletion

Commit d8630bb95f46 ('Serialize session deletion by using work_lock')
tries to fixup a deadlock when deleting sessions, but fails to take into
account the locking rules. This patch resolves the situation by
introducing a separate lock for processing the GNLIST response, and
ensures that sess_lock is released before calling
qlt_schedule_sess_delete().
