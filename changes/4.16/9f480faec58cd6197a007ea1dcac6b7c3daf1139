crypto: chacha20 - Fix keystream alignment for chacha20_block()

When chacha20_block() outputs the keystream block, it uses 'u32' stores
directly.  However, the callers (crypto/chacha20_generic.c and
drivers/char/random.c) declare the keystream buffer as a 'u8' array,
which is not guaranteed to have the needed alignment.

Fix it by having both callers declare the keystream as a 'u32' array.
For now this is preferable to switching over to the unaligned access
macros because chacha20_block() is only being used in cases where we can
easily control the alignment (stack buffers).
