CIFS: SMBD: Read correct returned data length for RDMA write (SMB read) I/O

This patch is for preparing upper layer doing SMB read via RDMA write.

When RDMA write is used for SMB read, the returned data length is in
DataRemaining in the response packet. Reading it properly by adding a
parameter to specifiy where the returned data length is.

Add the defition for memory registration to wdata and return the correct
length based on if RDMA write is used.
