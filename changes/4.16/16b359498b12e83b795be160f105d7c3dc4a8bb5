ixgbevf: add support for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC/WEAK_ORDERING

Based on commit 5be5955425c2
("igb: update driver to make use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC")
and
commit 7bd175928280 ("igb: Add support for DMA_ATTR_WEAK_ORDERING")

Convert the calls to dma_map/unmap_page() to the attributes version
and add DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC/WEAK_ORDERING which should help
improve performance on some platforms.

Move sync_for_cpu call before we perform a prefetch to avoid
invalidating the first 128 bytes of the packet on architectures where
that call may invalidate the cache.
