mmc: block: Add blk-mq support

Define and use a blk-mq queue. Discards and flushes are processed
synchronously, but reads and writes asynchronously. In order to support
slow DMA unmapping, DMA unmapping is not done until after the next request
is started. That means the request is not completed until then. If there is
no next request then the completion is done by queued work.
