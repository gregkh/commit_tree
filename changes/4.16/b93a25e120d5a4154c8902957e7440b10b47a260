media: dvb_net: ensure that dvb_net_ule_handle is fully initialized

commit efb9ab67255f ("[media] dvb_net: prepare to split a very
complex function") changed the ULE handling logic, simplifying it.
However, it forgot to keep the initialization for .priv and to
zero .ule_hist fields.

The lack of .priv cause crashes if dvb_net_ule() is called, as
the function assuems that .priv field to be initialized.

With regards to .ule_hist, the current logic is broken and don't
even compile if ULE_DEBUG. Fix it by making the debug vars static
again, and be sure to pass iov parameter to dvb_net_ule_check_crc().
