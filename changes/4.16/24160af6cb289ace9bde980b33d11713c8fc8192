KVM: s390: add GISA interrupts to FLIC ioctl interface

Pending interrupts marked in the GISA IPM are required to
become part of the answer of ioctl KVM_DEV_FLIC_GET_ALL_IRQS.

The ioctl KVM_DEV_FLIC_ENQUEUE is already capable to enqueue
adapter interrupts when a GISA is present.

With ioctl KVM_DEV_FLIC_CLEAR_IRQS the GISA IPM wil be cleared
now as well.
