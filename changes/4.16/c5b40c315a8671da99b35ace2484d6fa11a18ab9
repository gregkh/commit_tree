soc: bcm: brcmstb: Be multi-platform compatible

We were making a bunch of wrong assumptions that turned out to blow out
on non-Broadcom STB platforms:

- we would return -ENODEV from brcmstb_soc_device_early_init() if we
  could not find the sun_top_ctrl device node, this is not an error
  in the context of a multi-platform kernel
- we would still try to register the Broadcom STB SoC device, even if we
  are not running on such a platform

While at it, also fix the sun_top_ctrl device_node leaks while we change
the flow of brcmstb_soc_device_init() and
brcmstb_soc_device_early_init().
