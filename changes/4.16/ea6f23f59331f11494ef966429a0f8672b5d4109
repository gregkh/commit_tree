ARM: dts: Add TVE/TVC and ILI9322 panel to DIR-685

This adds the TVE200/TVC TV-encoder and the Ilitek ILI9322 panel
to the DIR-685 device tree.

This brings graphics to this funky router and it is possible to
even run a console on its tiny screen.

Incidentally this requires us to disable the access to the
parallel (NOR) flash, as the communication pins to the panel
are shared with the flash memory.

To access the flash, a separate kernel with the panel disabled
and the flash enabled should be booted. The pin control selecting
whether to use the lines cannot be altered at runtime due to
hardware constraints.
