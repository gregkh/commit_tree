mm: memcontrol: eliminate raw access to stat and event counters

Replace all raw 'this_cpu_' modifications of the stat and event per-cpu
counters with API functions such as mod_memcg_state().

This makes the code easier to read, but is also in preparation for the
next patch, which changes the per-cpu implementation of those counters.
