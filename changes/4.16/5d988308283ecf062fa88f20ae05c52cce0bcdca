ceph: track read contexts in ceph_file_info

Previously ceph_read_iter() uses current->journal to pass context info
to ceph_readpages(), so that ceph_readpages() can distinguish read(2)
from readahead(2)/fadvise(2)/madvise(2). The problem is that page fault
can happen when copying data to userspace memory. Page fault may call
other filesystem's page_mkwrite() if the userspace memory is mapped to a
file. The later filesystem may also want to use current->journal.

The fix is define a on-stack data structure in ceph_read_iter(), add it
to context list in ceph_file_info. ceph_readpages() searches the list,
find if there is a context belongs to current thread.
