KVM: s390: provide only a single function for setting the tod (fix SCK)

Right now, SET CLOCK called in the guest does not properly take care of
the epoch index, as the call goes via the old kvm_s390_set_tod_clock()
interface. So the epoch index is neither reset to 0, if required, nor
properly set to e.g. 0xff on negative values.

Fix this by providing a single kvm_s390_set_tod_clock() function. Move
Multiple-epoch facility handling into it.
