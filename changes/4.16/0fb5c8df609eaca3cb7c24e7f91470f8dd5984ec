tools/testing/nvdimm: force nfit_test to depend on instrumented modules

The libnvdimm unit tests will fail when they are run against the
production / in-tree version of libnvdimm.ko or nfit.ko due to
symbols not being mocked per nfit_test's expectation. For example,
nfit_test expects acpi_evaluate_dsm() to be replaced by
__wrap_acpi_evaluate_dsm() to test how acpi_nfit_ctl() responds to
different stimuli.

Create a test-only symbol name that nfit_test links against to cause
module load failures when the wrong module is present.

For example, with this change, attempts to use the wrong module will
report:

    nfit_test: Unknown symbol libnvdimm_test (err 0)
