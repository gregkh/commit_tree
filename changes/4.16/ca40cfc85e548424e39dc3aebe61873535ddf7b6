drm/atomic-helper: Make zpos property kerneldoc less misleading

kerneldoc for drm_plane_create_zpos_property() says that the DRM core
will automatically calculate the normalized zpos values, but it doesn't
actually do that anymore since commit 38d868e41c4b ("drm: Don't force
all planes to be added to the state due to zpos"). Instead, drivers are
supposed to explicitly call the drm_atomic_normalize_zpos() function.
Change the kerneldoc comment to reflect that.

v2: reference the commit that introduced the kerneldoc unclarity
