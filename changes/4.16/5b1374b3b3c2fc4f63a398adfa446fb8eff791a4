kconfig: Fix expr_free() E_NOT leak

Only the E_NOT operand and not the E_NOT node itself was freed, due to
accidentally returning too early in expr_free(). Outline of leak:

	switch (e->type) {
	...
	case E_NOT:
		expr_free(e->left.expr);
		return;
	...
	}
	*Never reached, 'e' leaked*
	free(e);

Fix by changing the 'return' to a 'break'.

Summary from Valgrind on 'menuconfig' (ARCH=x86) before the fix:

	LEAK SUMMARY:
	   definitely lost: 44,448 bytes in 1,852 blocks

Summary after the fix:
