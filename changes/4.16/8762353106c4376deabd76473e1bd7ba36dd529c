scsi: cxlflash: Remove embedded CXL work structures

The CXL-specific work structure used to request the number of interrupts
currently resides as a nested member of both the context information and
hardware queue structures. It is used to cache values (specifically the
number of interrupts) required by the CXL layer when starting a context.

To facilitate staging that will ultimately allow the cxlflash core to
become agnostic of the underlying accelerator transport, remove these
embedded work structures.
