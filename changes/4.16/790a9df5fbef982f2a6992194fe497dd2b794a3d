KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make HPT resizing work on POWER9

This adds code to enable the HPT resizing code to work on POWER9,
which uses a slightly modified HPT entry format compared to POWER8.
On POWER9, we convert HPTEs read from the HPT from the new format to
the old format so that the rest of the HPT resizing code can work as
before.  HPTEs written to the new HPT are converted to the new format
as the last step before writing them into the new HPT.

This takes out the checks added by commit bcd3bb63dbc8 ("KVM: PPC:
Book3S HV: Disable HPT resizing on POWER9 for now", 2017-02-18),
now that HPT resizing works on POWER9.

On POWER9, when we pivot to the new HPT, we now call
kvmppc_setup_partition_table() to update the partition table in order
to make the hardware use the new HPT.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - added kvmppc_setup_partition_table() call,
 wrote commit message.]
