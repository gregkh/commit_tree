btrfs: Fix memory barriers usage with device stats counters

Commit addc3fa74e5b ("Btrfs: Fix the problem that the dirty flag of dev
stats is cleared") reworked the way device stats changes are tracked. A
new atomic dev_stats_ccnt counter was introduced which is incremented
every time any of the device stats counters are changed. This serves as
a flag whether there are any pending stats changes. However, this patch
only partially implemented the correct memory barriers necessary:

- It only ordered the stores to the counters but not the reads e.g.
  btrfs_run_dev_stats
- It completely omitted any comments documenting the intended design and
  how the memory barriers pair with each-other

This patch provides the necessary comments as well as adds a missing
smp_rmb in btrfs_run_dev_stats. Furthermore since dev_stats_cnt is only
a snapshot at best there was no point in reading the counter twice -
once in btrfs_dev_stats_dirty and then again when assigning stats_cnt.
Just collapse both reads into 1.
