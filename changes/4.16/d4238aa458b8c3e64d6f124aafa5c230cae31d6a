watchdog: aspeed: Move init to arch_initcall

Probing at device_initcall time lead to perverse cases where the
watchdog was probed after, say, I2C devices, which then leaves a
potentially running watchdog at the mercy of I2C device behaviour and
bus conditions.

Load the watchdog driver early to ensure that the kernel is patting it
well before initialising peripherals.
