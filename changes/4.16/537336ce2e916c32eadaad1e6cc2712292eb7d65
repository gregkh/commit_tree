staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Flow affinity for IP forwarding

The driver xmit function chooses an egress FQ based on the current
core id. The network stack itself sets a mapping field in the skb
based on many things - the default one being a hash on packet fields,
which the current driver ignores.

This patch saves the ingress frame flow affinity information in the
skb. In case of forwarded frames, this info will then be used for Tx
and Tx confirmation hardware queue selection, ensuring all processing
of the given frame is done on a single core.
