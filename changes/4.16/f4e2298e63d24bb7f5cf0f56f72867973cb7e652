bpf/tracing: fix kernel/events/core.c compilation error

Commit f371b304f12e ("bpf/tracing: allow user space to
query prog array on the same tp") introduced a perf
ioctl command to query prog array attached to the
same perf tracepoint. The commit introduced a
compilation error under certain config conditions, e.g.,
  (1). CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL is not defined, or
  (2). CONFIG_TRACING is defined but neither CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENTS
       nor CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS is defined.

Error message:
  kernel/events/core.o: In function `perf_ioctl':
  core.c:(.text+0x98c4): undefined reference to `bpf_event_query_prog_array'

This patch fixed this error by guarding the real definition under
CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS and provided static inline dummy function
if CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS was not defined.
It renamed the function from bpf_event_query_prog_array to
perf_event_query_prog_array and moved the definition from linux/bpf.h
to linux/trace_events.h so the definition is in proximity to
other prog_array related functions.
