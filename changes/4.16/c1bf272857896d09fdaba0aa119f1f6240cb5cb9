drm/i915: Show HWSP in intel_engine_dump()

Looking at a CI failure with an ominous line of
[  362.550715] hangcheck current seqno ffffff6b, last ffffff8c, hangcheck ffffff6b [6016 ms], inflight 118
with no apparent cause for the seqno to be negative, left me wondering
if someone had scribbled over the HWSP. So include the HWSP in the
engine dump to see if there are more signs of random scribbling.

v2: Fix row pointer, i is now incremented by 8 so doesn't need scaling
by 8, and we don't need to keep volatile here as the status_page isn't
marked up as volatile itself.
v3: Use hexdump, with suppression of identical lines. (Tvrtko)
    Which results in

HWSP:
