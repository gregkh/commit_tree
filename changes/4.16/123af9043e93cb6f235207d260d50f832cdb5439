ASoC: au1x: Fix timeout tests in au1xac97c_ac97_read()

The loop timeout doesn't work because it's a post op and ends with "tmo"
set to -1.  I changed it from a post-op to a pre-op and I changed the
initial the starting value from 5 to 6 so we still iterate 5 times.  I
left the other as it was because it's a large number.
