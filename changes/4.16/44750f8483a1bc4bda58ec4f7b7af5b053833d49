net/ipv6: onlink nexthop checks should default to main table

Because of differences in how ipv4 and ipv6 handle fib lookups,
verification of nexthops with onlink flag need to default to the main
table rather than the local table used by IPv4. As it stands an
address within a connected route on device 1 can be used with
onlink on device 2. Updating the table properly rejects the route
due to the egress device mismatch.

Update the extack message as well to show it could be a device
mismatch for the nexthop spec.
