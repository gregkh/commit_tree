usb: dwc3: Allow disabling of metastability workaround

Some platforms (e.g. TI's DRA7 USB2 instance) have more trouble
with the metastability workaround as it supports only
a High-Speed PHY and the PHY can enter into an Erratic state [1]
when the controller is set in SuperSpeed mode as part of
the metastability workaround.

This causes upto 2 seconds delay in enumeration on DRA7's USB2
instance in gadget mode.

If these platforms can be better off without the workaround,
provide a device tree property to suggest that so the workaround
is avoided.
