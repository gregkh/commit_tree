cifs: silence compiler warnings showing up with gcc-8.0.0

This bug was fixed before, but came up again with the latest
compiler in another function:

fs/cifs/cifssmb.c: In function 'CIFSSMBSetEA':
fs/cifs/cifssmb.c:6362:3: error: 'strncpy' offset 8 is out of the bounds [0, 4] [-Werror=array-bounds]
   strncpy(parm_data->list[0].name, ea_name, name_len);

Let's apply the same fix that was used for the other instances.
