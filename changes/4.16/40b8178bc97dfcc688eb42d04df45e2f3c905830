ixgbevf: clear rx_buffer_info in configure instead of clean

Based on commit d2bead576e67
("igb: Clear Rx buffer_info in configure instead of clean")

This change makes it so that instead of going through the entire ring on Rx
cleanup we only go through the region that was designated to be cleaned up
and stop when we reach the region where new allocations should start.

In addition we can avoid having to perform a memset on the Rx buffer_info
structures until we are about to start using the ring again.
