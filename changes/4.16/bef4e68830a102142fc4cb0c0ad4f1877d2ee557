scsi: aacraid: Fix driver oops with dead battery

The battery in my HP NetRAID-4M died of old age, and the aacraid driver
started oopsing with NULL pointer dereference on startup after that.

Fix it by reordering the init sequence to fill in function pointers
before ioremapping memory, or dev->a_ops.adapter_ioremap pointer will be
NULL.

Other subtypes of aacraid seem to have the order already correct.

This was the call trace:
