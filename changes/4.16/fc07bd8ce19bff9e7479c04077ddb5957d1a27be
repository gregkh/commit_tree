iwlwifi: mvm: fix IBSS for devices that support station type API

In IBSS, the mac80211 sets the cab_queue to be invalid.

However, the multicast station uses it, so we need to override it.

A previous patch did it, but it was nested inside the if's and was
applied only for legacy FWs that don't support the new station type
API, instead of being applied for all paths.

In addition, add a missing NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC to the initialization
of the queues in iwl_mvm_mac_ctxt_init()
