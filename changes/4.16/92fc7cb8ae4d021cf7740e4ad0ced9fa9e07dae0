lib/test_sort.c: add module unload support

test_sort.c performs array-based and linked list sort test.  Code allows
to compile either as a loadable modules or builtin into the kernel.

Current code is not allow to unload the test_sort.ko module after
successful completion.

This patch adds support to unload the "test_sort.ko" module by adding
module_exit support.

Previous patch was implemented auto unload support by returning -EAGAIN
from module_init() function on successful case, but this approach is not
ideal.

The auto-unload might seem like a nice optimization, but it encourages
inconsistent behaviour.  And behaviour that is different from all other
normal modules.
