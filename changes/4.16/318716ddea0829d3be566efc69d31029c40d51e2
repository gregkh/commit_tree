dm: safely allocate multiple bioset bios

DM targets can request multiple bios be sent to them by DM core (see:
num_{flush,discard,write_same,write_zeroes}_bios).  But until now these
bios were allocated in an unsafe manner than could potentially exhaust
the DM device's bioset -- in the face of multiple threads each trying to
do multiple allocations from the same DM device's bioset.

Fix __send_duplicate_bios() by using the new alloc_multiple_bios().  The
allocation strategy used by alloc_multiple_bios() models that used by
dm-crypt.c:crypt_alloc_buffer().

Neil Brown initially proposed this fix but the implementation has been
revised enough that it inappropriate to attribute the entirety of it to
him.
