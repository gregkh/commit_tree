x86/kvm: Pass stable clocksource to guests when running nested on Hyper-V

Currently, KVM is able to work in 'masterclock' mode passing
PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT to guests when the clocksource which is used on the
host is TSC.

When running nested on Hyper-V the guest normally uses a different one: TSC
page which is resistant to TSC frequency changes on events like L1
migration. Add support for it in KVM.

The only non-trivial change is in vgettsc(): when updating the gtod copy
both the clock readout and tsc value have to be updated now.
