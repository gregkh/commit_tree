rhashtable: Change rhashtable_walk_start to return void

Most callers of rhashtable_walk_start don't care about a resize event
which is indicated by a return value of -EAGAIN. So calls to
rhashtable_walk_start are wrapped wih code to ignore -EAGAIN. Something
like this is common:

       ret = rhashtable_walk_start(rhiter);
       if (ret && ret != -EAGAIN)
               goto out;

Since zero and -EAGAIN are the only possible return values from the
function this check is pointless. The condition never evaluates to true.

This patch changes rhashtable_walk_start to return void. This simplifies
code for the callers that ignore -EAGAIN. For the few cases where the
caller cares about the resize event, particularly where the table can be
walked in mulitple parts for netlink or seq file dump, the function
rhashtable_walk_start_check has been added that returns -EAGAIN on a
resize event.
