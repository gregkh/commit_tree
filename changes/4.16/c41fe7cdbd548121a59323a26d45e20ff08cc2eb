watchdog: xen_wdt: remove info message and version number

The initial info message (early in the xen_wdt_init_module() function)
is not very useful and we already have a message on successful probe. If
the probe fails, additional messages are printed anyway.

The version number serves no useful purpose and it ran out of favor
upstream anyway.
