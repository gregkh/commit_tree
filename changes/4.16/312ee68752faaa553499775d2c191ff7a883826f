kconfig: announce removal of oldnoconfig if used

The 'oldnoconfig' is really confusing due to its counter-intuitive name.
It was renamed by commit fb16d8912db5 ("kconfig: replace 'oldnoconfig'
with 'olddefconfig', and keep the old name as an alias").

The 'oldnoconfig' has been kept as an alias for enough period of time,
and finally I am planning to remove it.  I will give people a little
more time for migration.  Meanwhile, the following message will be
displayed if oldnoconfig is used.

    WARNING: "oldnoconfig" target will be removed after Linux 4.19
              Please use "olddefconfig" instead, which is an alias.
