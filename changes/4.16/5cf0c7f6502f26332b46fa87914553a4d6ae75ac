fpga: mgr: API change to replace fpga load functions with single function

fpga-mgr has three methods for programming FPGAs, depending on
whether the image is in a scatter gather list, a contiguous
buffer, or a firmware file. This makes it difficult to write
upper layers as the caller has to assume whether the FPGA image
is in a sg table, as a single buffer, or a firmware file.
This commit moves these parameters to struct fpga_image_info
and adds a single function for programming fpgas.

New functions:
* fpga_mgr_load - given fpga manager and struct fpga_image_info,
   program the fpga.

* fpga_image_info_alloc - alloc a struct fpga_image_info.

* fpga_image_info_free - free a struct fpga_image_info.

These three functions are unexported:
* fpga_mgr_buf_load_sg
* fpga_mgr_buf_load
* fpga_mgr_firmware_load

Also use devm_kstrdup to copy firmware_name so we aren't making
assumptions about where it comes from when allocing/freeing the
struct fpga_image_info.

API documentation has been updated and a new document for
FPGA region has been added.
