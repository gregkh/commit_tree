drm/amdkfd: Add support for user-mode trap handlers

A second-level user mode trap handler can be installed. The CWSR trap
handler jumps to the secondary trap handler conditionally for any
conditions not handled by it. This can be used e.g. for debugging or
catching math exceptions.

When CWSR is disabled, the user mode trap handler is installed as
first level trap handler.
