resource: Set type of "reserve=" user-specified resources

When we reserve regions because the user specified a "reserve=" parameter,
set the resource type to either IORESOURCE_IO (for regions below 0x10000)
or IORESOURCE_MEM.  The test for 0x10000 is just a heuristic; obviously
there can be memory below 0x10000 as well.

Improve documentation of the "reserve=" parameter.
