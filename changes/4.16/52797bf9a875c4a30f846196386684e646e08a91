KVM: x86: Add emulation of MSR_SMI_COUNT

This MSR returns the number of #SMIs that occurred on CPU since
boot.

It was seen to be used frequently by ESXi guest.

Patch adds a new vcpu-arch specific var called smi_count to
save the number of #SMIs which occurred on CPU since boot.
It is exposed as a read-only MSR to guest (causing #GP
on wrmsr) in RDMSR/WRMSR emulation code.
MSR_SMI_COUNT is also added to emulated_msrs[] to make sure
user-space can save/restore it for migration purposes.
