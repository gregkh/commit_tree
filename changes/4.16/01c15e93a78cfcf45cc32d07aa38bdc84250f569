nfp: flower: prioritize stats updates

Previously it was possible to interrupt processing stats updates because
they were handled in a work queue. Interrupting the stats updates could
lead to a situation where we backup the control message queue. This patch
moves the stats update processing out of the work queue to be processed as
soon as hardware sends a request.
