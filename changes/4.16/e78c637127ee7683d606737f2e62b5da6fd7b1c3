ARM: dts: rockchip: Fix DWMMC clocks

Trying to boot an RK3328 box with an HS200-capable eMMC, I see said eMMC
fail to initialise as it can't run its tuning procedure, because the
sample clock is missing. Upon closer inspection, whilst the clock is
present in the DT, its name is subtly incorrect per the binding, so
__of_clk_get_by_name() never finds it. By inspection, the drive clock
suffers from a similar problem, so has never worked properly either.

This error has propagated across the 32-bit DTs too, so fix those up.
