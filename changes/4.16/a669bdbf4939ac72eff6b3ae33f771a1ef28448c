scsi: hisi_sas: optimise port id refresh function

Currently refreshing the PHY port id after reset is done in the rescan
topology function, which is quite late in the reset process. It could be moved
earlier in the process, as the port id can be refreshed once the PHYs become
ready.

In addition to this, we should set the hisi_sas_dev port id to 0xff (invalid
port id) if all PHYs of this port remain down for the same device.
