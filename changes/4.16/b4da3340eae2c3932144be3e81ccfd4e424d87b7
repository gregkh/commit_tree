tracing/kprobe: bpf: Check error injectable event is on function entry

Check whether error injectable event is on function entry or not.
Currently it checks the event is ftrace-based kprobes or not,
but that is wrong. It should check if the event is on the entry
of target function. Since error injection will override a function
to just return with modified return value, that operation must
be done before the target function starts making stackframe.

As a side effect, bpf error injection is no need to depend on
function-tracer. It can work with sw-breakpoint based kprobe
events too.
