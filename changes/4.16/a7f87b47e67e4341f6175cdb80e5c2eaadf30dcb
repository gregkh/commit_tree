netfilter: remove defensive check on malformed packets from raw sockets

Users cannot forge malformed IPv4/IPv6 headers via raw sockets that they
can inject into the stack. Specifically, not for IPv4 since 55888dfb6ba7
("AF_RAW: Augment raw_send_hdrinc to expand skb to fit iphdr->ihl
(v2)"). IPv6 raw sockets also ensure that packets have a well-formed
IPv6 header available in the skbuff.

At quick glance, br_netfilter also validates layer 3 headers and it
drops malformed both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

Therefore, let's remove this defensive check all over the place.
