kconfig: Don't leak main menus during parsing

If a 'mainmenu' entry appeared in the Kconfig files, two things would
leak:

	- The 'struct property' allocated for the default "Linux Kernel
	  Configuration" prompt.

	- The string for the T_WORD/T_WORD_QUOTE prompt after the
	  T_MAINMENU token, allocated on the heap in zconf.l.

To fix it, introduce a new 'no_mainmenu_stmt' nonterminal that matches
if there's no 'mainmenu' and adds the default prompt. That means the
prompt only gets allocated once regardless of whether there's a
'mainmenu' statement or not, and managing it becomes simple.

Summary from Valgrind on 'menuconfig' (ARCH=x86) before the fix:

	LEAK SUMMARY:
	   definitely lost: 344,568 bytes in 14,352 blocks

Summary after the fix:
