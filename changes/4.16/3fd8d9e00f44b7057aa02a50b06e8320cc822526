dt-bindings: Add binding for Ilitek ILI9225 display panels

This adds a new binding for display panels that use an Ilitek ILI9225
controller.

The "ilitek,ili9225-2.2in-176x220" device listed has no identification
markings whatsoever and an hour of googling turned up nothing, hence the use
of the size and resolution in the name instead of a model name.

An example of this nameless device can be found at:
