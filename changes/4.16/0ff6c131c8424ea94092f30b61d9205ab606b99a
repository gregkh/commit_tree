media: i2c: adv748x: Restore full DT paths in kernel messages

As of_node_full_name() now returns only the basename, the endpoint
information printed became useless:

    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint endpoint on port 7
    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint endpoint on port 8
    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint endpoint on port 10
    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint endpoint on port 11

Restore the old behavior by using "%pOF" instead:

    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint /soc/i2c@e66d8000/video-receiver@70/port@7/endpoint on port 7
    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint /soc/i2c@e66d8000/video-receiver@70/port@8/endpoint on port 8
    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint /soc/i2c@e66d8000/video-receiver@70/port@10/endpoint on port 10
    adv748x 4-0070: Endpoint /soc/i2c@e66d8000/video-receiver@70/port@11/endpoint on port 11

Fixes: a7e4cfb0a7ca4773 ("of/fdt: only store the device node basename in full_name")
