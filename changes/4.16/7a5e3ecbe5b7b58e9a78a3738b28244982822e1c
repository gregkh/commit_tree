bcache: set writeback_rate_update_seconds in range [1, 60] seconds

dc->writeback_rate_update_seconds can be set via sysfs and its value can
be set to [1, ULONG_MAX].  It does not make sense to set such a large
value, 60 seconds is long enough value considering the default 5 seconds
works well for long time.

Because dc->writeback_rate_update is a special delayed work, it re-arms
itself inside the delayed work routine update_writeback_rate(). When
stopping it by cancel_delayed_work_sync(), there should be a timeout to
wait and make sure the re-armed delayed work is stopped too. A small max
value of dc->writeback_rate_update_seconds is also helpful to decide a
reasonable small timeout.

This patch limits sysfs interface to set dc->writeback_rate_update_seconds
in range of [1, 60] seconds, and replaces the hand-coded number by macros.

Changelog:
v2: fix a rebase typo in v4, which is pointed out by Michael Lyle.
v1: initial version.
