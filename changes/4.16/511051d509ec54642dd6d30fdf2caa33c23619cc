iio: srf08: fix link error "devm_iio_triggered_buffer_setup" undefined

Functions for triggered buffer support are needed by this module.
If they are not defined accidentally by another driver, there's an error
thrown out while linking.

Add a select of IIO_BUFFER and IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER in the Kconfig file.
