    drm/i915/bdw: Avoid non-lite-restore preemptions

execlists has listened to (ACTIVE_IDLE | ELEMENT_SWITCH) for detecting
when one context completed and it either continued onto the next (in port
1) or idled. We would always see COMPLETE | ACTIVE_IDLE on the final
context-switch event, but on recent gen it appears that we now get
separate ACTIVE_IDLE and COMPLETE events. In particular, the ACTIVE_IDLE
events may not be coupled to a context (since it is a general state rather
than a specific context completion event).

v2: Update the history, execlists did originally start out by listening
to the COMPLETE event not ACTIVE_IDLE.
v3: Update preempt completion test to also use COMPLETE not ACTIVE_IDLE.
