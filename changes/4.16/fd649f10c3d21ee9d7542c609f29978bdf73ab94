btrfs: Fix use-after-free when cleaning up fs_devs with a single stale device

Commit 4fde46f0cc71 ("Btrfs: free the stale device") introduced
btrfs_free_stale_device which iterates the device lists for all
registered btrfs filesystems and deletes those devices which aren't
mounted. In a btrfs_devices structure has only 1 device attached to it
and it is unused then btrfs_free_stale_devices will proceed to also free
the btrfs_fs_devices struct itself. Currently this leads to a use after
free since list_for_each_entry will try to perform a check on the
already freed memory to see if it has to terminate the loop.

The fix is to use 'break' when we know we are freeing the current
fs_devs.
