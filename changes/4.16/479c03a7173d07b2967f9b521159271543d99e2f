spi: orion: Fix a resource leak if the optional "axi" clk is deferred

If the optional "axi" clk is deferred, we still need to undo some
initialisation. Especially 'master' must be released. It will be
reallocated the next time 'orion_spi_probe()' is called.

Add a new label to clean what needs to be cleaned and rename another
label to improve the names used.
