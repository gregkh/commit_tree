ALSA: pcm: Set config update bits only when really changed

The PCM config space refine codes touch the parameter rmask and cmask
bits when the given config parameter is changed.  But in most places
it checks only whether the changed value is non-zero or not, and they
don't consider whether a negative error value is returned.  This will
lead to the incorrect update bits set upon the error path.

Fix the codes to check properly the return code whether it's really
updated or an error.
