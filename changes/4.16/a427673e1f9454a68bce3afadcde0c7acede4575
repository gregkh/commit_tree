nfp: flower: remove dead code paths

Port matching is selected by default on every rule so remove check for it
and delete 'else' side of the statement. Remove nfp_flower_meta_one as now
it will not feature in the code. Rename nfp_flower_meta_two given that one
has been removed.

'Additional metadata' if statement can never be true so remove it as well.
