ath10k: wmi: modify svc bitmap parsing for wcn3990

Due to the limitation of wmi tlv parsing logic, if there are
two parameters in a wmi event with same tlv tag, we can get only
the last value, as it overwrites the prev value of the same tlv tag.

The service ready event in wcn3990 contains two parameters of the
same tag UINT32, due to which the svc bitmap is overwritten with the
DBS support parameter.

Refactor the service ready event parsing to allow parsing two tlv
of the same tag UINT32 for wcn3990.
