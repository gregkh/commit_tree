crypto: algapi - convert cra_refcnt to refcount_t

Reference counters should use refcount_t rather than atomic_t, since the
refcount_t implementation can prevent overflows, reducing the
exploitability of reference leak bugs.  crypto_alg.cra_refcount is a
reference counter with the usual semantics, so switch it over to
refcount_t.
