lightnvm: pblk: refactor emeta consistency check

Currently pblk_recov_get_lba list does two separate things:
it checks the consistency of the emeta and extracts the lba list.

This patch separates the consistency check to make the code easier
to read and to prepare for version checks of the line emeta
persistent data format version.
