crypto: poly1305 - remove ->setkey() method

Since Poly1305 requires a nonce per invocation, the Linux kernel
implementations of Poly1305 don't use the crypto API's keying mechanism
and instead expect the key and nonce as the first 32 bytes of the data.
But ->setkey() is still defined as a stub returning an error code.  This
prevents Poly1305 from being used through AF_ALG and will also break it
completely once we start enforcing that all crypto API users (not just
AF_ALG) call ->setkey() if present.

Fix it by removing crypto_poly1305_setkey(), leaving ->setkey as NULL.
