sit: fix IFLA_MTU ignored on NEWLINK

Commit 128bb975dc3c ("ip6_gre: init dev->mtu and dev->hard_header_len
correctly") fixed IFLA_MTU ignored on NEWLINK for ip6_gre. The same
mtu fix is also needed for sit.

Note that dev->hard_header_len setting for sit works fine, no need to
fix it. sit is actually ipv4 tunnel, it can't call ip6_tnl_change_mtu
to set mtu.
