media: bdisp: Fix a possible sleep-in-atomic bug in bdisp_hw_save_request

The driver may sleep under a spinlock.
The function call path is:
bdisp_device_run (acquire the spinlock)
  bdisp_hw_update
    bdisp_hw_save_request
      devm_kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL) --> may sleep

To fix it, GFP_KERNEL is replaced with GFP_ATOMIC.

This bug is found by my static analysis tool(DSAC) and checked by my code review.
