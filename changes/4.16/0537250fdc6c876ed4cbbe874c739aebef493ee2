netfilter: x_tables: make allocation less aggressive

syzbot has noticed that xt_alloc_table_info can allocate a lot of memory.
This is an admin only interface but an admin in a namespace is sufficient
as well.  eacd86ca3b03 ("net/netfilter/x_tables.c: use kvmalloc() in
xt_alloc_table_info()") has changed the opencoded kmalloc->vmalloc
fallback into kvmalloc.  It has dropped __GFP_NORETRY on the way because
vmalloc has simply never fully supported __GFP_NORETRY semantic.  This is
still the case because e.g.  page tables backing the vmalloc area are
hardcoded GFP_KERNEL.

Revert back to __GFP_NORETRY as a poors man defence against excessively
large allocation request here.  We will not rule out the OOM killer
completely but __GFP_NORETRY should at least stop the large request in
most cases.
