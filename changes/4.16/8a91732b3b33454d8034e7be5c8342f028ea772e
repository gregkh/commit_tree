i2c: refactor i2c_master_{send_recv}

Those two functions are very similar, the only differences are that one
needs the I2C_M_RD flag for its message while the other one needs the
buffer casted to drop the const. Introduce a generic helper which allows
to specify the flags (also needed later for DMA safe variants of these
calls) and let the casting be done in the inlining functions which are
now calling the new helper function.
