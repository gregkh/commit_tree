scsi: qla2xxx: Fix crashes in qla2x00_probe_one on probe failure

Because of the shifting around of code in qla2x00_probe_one recently,
failures during adapter initialization can lead to problems, i.e. NULL
pointer crashes and doubly freed data structures which cause eventual
panics.

This V2 version makes the relevant memory free routines idempotent, so
repeat calls won't cause any harm. I also removed the problematic
probe_init_failed exit point as it is not needed.
