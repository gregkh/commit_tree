hwmon: (pmbus/max31785) Add fan control

The implementation makes use of the new fan control virtual registers
exposed by the pmbus core. It mixes use of the default implementations
with some overrides via the read/write handlers to handle FAN_COMMAND_1
on the MAX31785, whose definition breaks the value range into various
control bands dependent on RPM or PWM mode.
