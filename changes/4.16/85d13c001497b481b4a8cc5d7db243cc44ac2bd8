arm64: mm: Remove pre_ttbr0_update_workaround for Falkor erratum #E1003

The pre_ttbr0_update_workaround hook is called prior to context-switching
TTBR0 because Falkor erratum E1003 can cause TLB allocation with the wrong
ASID if both the ASID and the base address of the TTBR are updated at
the same time.

With the ASID sitting safely in TTBR1, we no longer update things
atomically, so we can remove the pre_ttbr0_update_workaround macro as
it's no longer required. The erratum infrastructure and documentation
is left around for #E1003, as it will be required by the entry
trampoline code in a future patch.
