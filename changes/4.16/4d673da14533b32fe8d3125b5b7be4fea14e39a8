afs: Support the AFS dynamic root

Support the AFS dynamic root which is a pseudo-volume that doesn't connect
to any server resource, but rather is just a root directory that
dynamically creates mountpoint directories where the name of such a
directory is the name of the cell.

Such a mount can be created thus:

	mount -t afs none /afs -o dyn

Dynamic root superblocks aren't shared except by bind mounts and
propagation.  Cell root volumes can then be mounted by referring to them by
name, e.g.:

	ls /afs/grand.central.org/
	ls /afs/.grand.central.org/

The kernel will upcall to consult the DNS if the address wasn't supplied
directly.
