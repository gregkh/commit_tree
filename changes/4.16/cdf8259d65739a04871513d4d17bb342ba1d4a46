can: m_can: Add PM Support

Add support for CONFIG_PM which is the new way to handle managing clocks.

Move the clock management to pm_runtime_resume() and pm_runtime_suspend()
callbacks for the driver.

CONFIG_PM is required by OMAP based devices to handle clock management.
Therefore, this allows future Texas Instruments SoCs that have the MCAN IP
to work with this driver.
