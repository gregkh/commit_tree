media: staging: atomisp: convert timestamps to ktime_t

timespec overflows in 2038 on 32-bit architectures, and the
getnstimeofday() suffers from possible time jumps, so the
timestamps here are better done using ktime_get(), which has
neither of those problems.

In case of ov2680, we don't seem to use the timestamp at
all, so I just remove it.
