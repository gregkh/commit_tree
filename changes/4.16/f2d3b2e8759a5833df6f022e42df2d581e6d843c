arm/arm64: smccc: Implement SMCCC v1.1 inline primitive

One of the major improvement of SMCCC v1.1 is that it only clobbers
the first 4 registers, both on 32 and 64bit. This means that it
becomes very easy to provide an inline version of the SMC call
primitive, and avoid performing a function call to stash the
registers that would otherwise be clobbered by SMCCC v1.0.
