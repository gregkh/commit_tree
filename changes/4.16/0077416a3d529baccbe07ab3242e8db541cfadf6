IB/mlx4: Fix corruption of RoCEv2 IPv4 GIDs

When using IPv4 addresses in RoCEv2, the GID format for the mapped
IPv4 address should be: ::ffff:<4-byte IPv4 address>.

In the cited commit, IPv4 mapped IPV6 addresses had the 3 upper dwords
zeroed out by memset, which resulted in deleting the ffff field.

However, since procedure ipv6_addr_v4mapped() already verifies that the
gid has format ::ffff:<ipv4 address>, no change is needed for the gid,
and the memset can simply be removed.
