arm/arm64: KVM: Implement PSCI 1.0 support

PSCI 1.0 can be trivially implemented by providing the FEATURES
call on top of PSCI 0.2 and returning 1.0 as the PSCI version.

We happily ignore everything else, as they are either optional or
are clarifications that do not require any additional change.

PSCI 1.0 is now the default until we decide to add a userspace
selection API.
