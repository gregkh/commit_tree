sparc64: Oracle DAX driver

DAX is a coprocessor which resides on the SPARC M7 (DAX1) and M8
(DAX2) processor chips, and has direct access to the CPU's L3 caches
as well as physical memory. It can perform several operations on data
streams with various input and output formats.  This driver provides a
transport mechanism and has limited knowledge of the various opcodes
and data formats. A user space library provides high level services
and translates these into low level commands which are then passed
into the driver and subsequently the hypervisor and the coprocessor.
The library is the recommended way for applications to use the
coprocessor, and the driver interface is not intended for general use.
