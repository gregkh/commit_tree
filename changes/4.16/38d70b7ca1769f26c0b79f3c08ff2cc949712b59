tools lib traceevent: Simplify pointer print logic and fix %pF

When processing %pX in pretty_print(), simplify the logic slightly by
incrementing the ptr to the format string if isalnum(ptr[1]) is true.
This follows the logic a bit more closely to what is in the kernel.

Also, this fixes a small bug where %pF was not giving the offset of the
function.
