tpm: use struct tpm_chip for tpm_chip_find_get()

Device number (the character device index) is not a stable identifier
for a TPM chip. That is the reason why every call site passes
TPM_ANY_NUM to tpm_chip_find_get().

This commit changes the API in a way that instead a struct tpm_chip
instance is given and NULL means the default chip. In addition, this
commit refines the documentation to be up to date with the
implementation.
