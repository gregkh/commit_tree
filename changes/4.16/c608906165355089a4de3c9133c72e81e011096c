ARM: probes: avoid adding kprobes to sensitive kernel-entry/exit code

Avoid adding kprobes to any of the kernel entry/exit or startup
assembly code, or code in the identity-mapped region.  This code does
not conform to the standard C conventions, which means that the
expectations of the kprobes code is not forfilled.

Placing kprobes at some of these locations results in the kernel trying
to return to userspace addresses while retaining the CPU in kernel mode.
