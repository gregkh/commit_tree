perf annotate: Add annotation_line__(new|delete) functions

Changing the way the annotation lines are allocated and adding
annotation_line__(new|delete) functions to deal with this.

Before the allocation schema was as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------
  struct disasm_line | struct annotation_line | private space
  -----------------------------------------------------------

Where the private space is used in TUI code to store computed
annotation data for events. The stdio code computes the data
on the fly.

The goal is to compute and store annotation line's data directly
in the struct annotation_line itself, so this patch changes the
line allocation schema as follows:

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  privsize space | struct disasm_line | struct annotation_line
  ------------------------------------------------------------

Moving struct annotation_line to the end, because in following
changes we will move here the non-fixed length event's data.
