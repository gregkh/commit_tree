ACPI / LPSS: Do not instiate platform_dev for devs without MMIO resources

acpi_lpss_create_device() skips handling LPSS devices which do not have
a mmio resources in their resource list (typically these devices are
disabled by the firmware). But since the LPSS code does not bind to the
device, acpi_bus_attach() ends up still creating a platform device for
it and the regular platform_driver for the ACPI HID still tries to bind
to it.

This happens e.g. on some boards which do not use the pwm-controller
and have an empty or invalid resource-table for it. Currently this causes
these error messages to get logged:

[    3.281966] pwm-lpss 80862288:00: invalid resource
[    3.287098] pwm-lpss: probe of 80862288:00 failed with error -22

This commit stops the undesirable creation of a platform_device for
disabled LPSS devices by setting pnp.type.platform_id to 0. Note that
acpi_scan_attach_handler() also sets pnp.type.platform_id to 0 when there
is a matching handler for the device and that handler has no attach
callback, so we simply behave as a handler without an attach function
in this case.
