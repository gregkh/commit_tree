PM / devfreq: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in governor_store

df->governor is being dereferenced before it is null checked,
hence there is a potential null pointer dereference.

Notice that df->governor is being null checked at line 1004:
if (df->governor) {, which implies it might be null.

Fix this by null checking df->governor before dereferencing it.
