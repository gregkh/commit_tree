powerpc: Remove useless EXC_COMMON_HV

The only difference between EXC_COMMON_HV and EXC_COMMON is that the
former adds "2" to the trap number which is supposed to represent the
fact that this is an "HV" interrupt which uses HSRR0/1.

However KVM is the only one who cares and it has its own separate macros.

In fact, we only have one user of EXC_COMMON_HV and it's for an
unknown interrupt case. All the other ones already using EXC_COMMON.
