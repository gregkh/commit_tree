Bluetooth: hci_qca: Avoid setup failure on missing rampatch

Assuming that the original code idea was to enable in-band sleeping
only if the setup_rome method returns succes and run in 'standard'
mode otherwise, we should not return setup_rome return value which
makes qca_setup fail if no rampatch/nvm file found.

This fixes BT issue on the dragonboard-820C p4 which includes the
following QCA controller:
hci0: Product:0x00000008
hci0: Patch  :0x00000111
hci0: ROM    :0x00000302
hci0: SOC    :0x00000044

Since there is no rampatch for this controller revision, just make
it work as is.
