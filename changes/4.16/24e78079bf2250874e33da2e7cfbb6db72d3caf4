gpio: label descriptors using the device name

Some GPIO lines appear named "?" in the lsgpio dump due to their
requesting drivers not passing a reasonable label.

Most typically this happens if a device tree node just defines
gpios = <...> and not foo-gpios = <...>, the former gets named
"foo" and the latter gets named "?".

However the struct device passed in is always valid so let's
just label the GPIO with dev_name() on the device if no proper
label was passed.
