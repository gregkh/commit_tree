arm64: handle 52-bit physical addresses in page table entries

The top 4 bits of a 52-bit physical address are positioned at bits
12..15 of a page table entry. Introduce macros to convert between a
physical address and its placement in a table entry, and change all
macros/functions that access PTEs to use them.
