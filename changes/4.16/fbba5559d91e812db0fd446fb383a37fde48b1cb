drm/i915/pmu: Clear the previous sample value when parking

When turning off the engines, and the pmu sampling, clear the previous
value as the current measurement should be 0.

v2: Use a for-loop
v3:
 * Move clearing to timer self-dis-arm to avoid race with parking.
 * Clear frequency samples as well.
v4:
 * Init frequency to idle_freq. (Chris Wilson)
