ovl: take mnt_want_write() for work/index dir setup

There are several write operations on upper fs not covered by
mnt_want_write():

- test set/remove OPAQUE xattr
- test create O_TMPFILE
- set ORIGIN xattr in ovl_verify_origin()
- cleanup of index entries in ovl_indexdir_cleanup()

Some of these go way back, but this patch only applies over the
v4.14 re-factoring of ovl_fill_super().
