mlxsw: core: Add support for reload

Add support for hot reload. First, all the driver/core resources are
released but the PCI and devlink instances, then reset is performed
through the PCI interface. Finally the driver performs initialization.

In case of reload failure the driver is left in a partially initialized
state. Special care is taken during the driver removal in order to
properly handle this state.
