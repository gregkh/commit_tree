powerpc/64: Move set_soft_enabled() and rename

Move set_soft_enabled() from powerpc/kernel/irq.c to asm/hw_irq.c, to
encourage updates to paca->soft_enabled done via these access
function. Add "memory" clobber to hint compiler since
paca->soft_enabled memory is the target here.

Renaming it as soft_enabled_set() will make namespaces works better as
prefix than a postfix when new soft_enabled manipulation functions are
introduced.
