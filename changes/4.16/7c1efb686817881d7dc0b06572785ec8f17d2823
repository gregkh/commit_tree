PCI: Mark Ceton InfiniTV4 INTx masking as broken

PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE is writable on the Ceton InfiniTV4, indicating
that the device supports disabling the INTx# signal, but it apparently
doesn't work.

Mark the device so we know we can't use PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE to disable
its interrupts.
