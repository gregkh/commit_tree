USB: serial: f81534: add high baud rate support

The F81532/534 had 4 clocksource 1.846/18.46/14.77/24MHz and baud rates
can be up to 1.5Mbits with 24MHz.

This device may generate data overrun when baud rate setting to 921600bps
or higher with old UART trigger level setting (8x14=112) with full
loading. We'll change trigger level from 8x14=112 to 8x8=64 to avoid data
overrun.

Also the read/write of EP0 will be affected by this patch. The worst case
of responding time is 20s when all serial port are full loading and trying
to access EP0, so we change EP0 timeout from 10 to 20s.

F81532/534 Clock register (offset +08h)

Bit0:	UART Enable (always on)
Bit2-1:	Clock source selector
			00: 1.846MHz.
			01: 18.46MHz.
			10: 24MHz.
			11: 14.77MHz.
