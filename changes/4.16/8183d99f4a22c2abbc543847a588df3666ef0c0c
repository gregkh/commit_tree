powerpc/lib/feature-fixups: use raw_patch_instruction()

feature fixups need to use patch_instruction() early in the boot,
even before the code is relocated to its final address, requiring
patch_instruction() to use PTRRELOC() in order to address data.

But feature fixups applies on code before it is set to read only,
even for modules. Therefore, feature fixups can use
raw_patch_instruction() instead.
