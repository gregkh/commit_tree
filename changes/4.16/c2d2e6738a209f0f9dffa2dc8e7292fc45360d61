xen-netfront: Fix hang on device removal

A toolstack may delete the vif frontend and backend xenstore entries
while xen-netfront is in the removal code path.  In that case, the
checks for xenbus_read_driver_state would return XenbusStateUnknown, and
xennet_remove would hang indefinitely.  This hang prevents system
shutdown.

xennet_remove must be able to handle XenbusStateUnknown, and
netback_changed must also wake up the wake_queue for that state as well.
