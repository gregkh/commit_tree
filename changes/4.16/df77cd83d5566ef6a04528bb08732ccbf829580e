drm/i915: Extract "emit write" part of emit breadcrumb functions

Let's separate the "emit" part from touching any internal structures,
this way we can have a generic "emit coherent GGTT write" function.
We would like to reuse this functionality for emitting HWSP write, to
confirm that preempt-to-idle has finished.

v2: Reorder args to match emit_pipe_control, s/render/rcs (Chris)
