bpf: restrict access to core bpf sysctls

Given BPF reaches far beyond just networking these days, it was
never intended to allow setting and in some cases reading those
knobs out of a user namespace root running without CAP_SYS_ADMIN,
thus tighten such access.

Also the bpf_jit_enable = 2 debugging mode should only be allowed
if kptr_restrict is not set since it otherwise can leak addresses
to the kernel log. Dump a note to the kernel log that this is for
debugging JITs only when enabled.
