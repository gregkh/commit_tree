acpi: nfit: Add support for detect platform CPU cache flush on power loss

In ACPI 6.2a the platform capability structure has been added to the NFIT
tables. That provides software the ability to determine whether a system
supports the auto flushing of CPU caches on power loss. If the capability
is supported, we do not need to do dax_flush(). Plumbing the path to set the
property on per region from the NFIT tables.

This patch depends on the ACPI NFIT 6.2a platform capabilities support code
in include/acpi/actbl1.h.
