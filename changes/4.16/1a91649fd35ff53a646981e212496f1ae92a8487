net: cxgb4: avoid memcpy beyond end of source buffer

Building with link-time-optimizations revealed that the cxgb4 driver does
a fixed-size memcpy() from a variable-length constant string into the
network interface name:

In function 'memcpy',
    inlined from 'cfg_queues_uld.constprop' at drivers/net/ethernet/chelsio/cxgb4/cxgb4_uld.c:335:2,
    inlined from 'cxgb4_register_uld.constprop' at drivers/net/ethernet/chelsio/cxgb4/cxgb4_uld.c:719:9:
include/linux/string.h:350:3: error: call to '__read_overflow2' declared with attribute error: detected read beyond size of object passed as 2nd parameter
   __read_overflow2();
   ^

I can see two equally workable solutions: either we use a strncpy() instead
of the memcpy() to stop at the end of the input, or we make the source buffer
fixed length as well. This implements the latter.
