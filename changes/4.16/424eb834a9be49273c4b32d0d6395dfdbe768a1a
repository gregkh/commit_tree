net: hns3: Unified HNS3 {VF|PF} Ethernet Driver for hip08 SoC

Most of the NAPI handling interface, skb buffer management,
management of the RX/TX descriptors, ethool interface etc.
has quite a bit of code which is common to VF and PF driver.

This patch makes the exisitng PF's HNS3 ENET driver as the
common ENET driver for both Virtual & Physical Function. This
will help in reduction of redundancy and better management of
code.
