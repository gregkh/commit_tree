arm64: dts: renesas: ulcb-kf: enable USB2 PHY of channel 0

This supports USB2 PHY channel #0 on ULCB Kingfisher board

The dedicated USB0_PWEN pin is used to control CN13 VBUS source from U43
power supply.
MAX3355 can also provide VBUS, hence it should be disabled via OTG_OFFVBUSn
node coming from gpio expander TCA9539.
Set MAX3355 enabled using OTG_EXTLPn node to be able to read OTG ID of
CN13.
