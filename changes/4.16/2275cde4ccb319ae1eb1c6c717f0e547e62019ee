SUNRPC: Queue latency-sensitive socket tasks to xprtiod

The response to a write_space notification is very latency sensitive,
so we should queue it to the lower latency xprtiod_workqueue. This
is something we already do for the other cases where an rpc task
holds the transport XPRT_LOCKED bitlock.
