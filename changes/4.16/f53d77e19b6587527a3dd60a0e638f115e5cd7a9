sctp: reset ret in again path in sctp_for_each_transport

Commit 97a6ec4ac021 ("rhashtable: Change rhashtable_walk_start to
return void") only initialized ret for the first time, when going
to again path, the next tsp could be NULL. Without resetting ret,
cb_done would be called with tsp as NULL.

A kernel crash was caused by this when running sctpdiag testcase
in sctp-tests.

Note that this issue doesn't affect net.git yet.
