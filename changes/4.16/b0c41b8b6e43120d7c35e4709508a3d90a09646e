powerpc/pseries: Fix vector5 in ibm architecture vector table

With ibm,dynamic-memory-v2 and ibm,drc-info coming around the same
time, byte22 in vector5 of ibm architecture vector table got set twice
separately. The end result is that guest kernel isn't advertising
support for ibm,dynamic-memory-v2.

Fix this by removing the duplicate assignment of byte22.
