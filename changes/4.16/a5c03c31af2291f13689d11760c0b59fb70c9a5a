x86/efi: Clarify that reset attack mitigation needs appropriate userspace

Some distributions have turned on the reset attack mitigation feature,
which is designed to force the platform to clear the contents of RAM if
the machine is shut down uncleanly. However, in order for the platform
to be able to determine whether the shutdown was clean or not, userspace
has to be configured to clear the MemoryOverwriteRequest flag on
shutdown - otherwise the firmware will end up clearing RAM on every
reboot, which is unnecessarily time consuming. Add some additional
clarity to the kconfig text to reduce the risk of systems being
configured this way.
