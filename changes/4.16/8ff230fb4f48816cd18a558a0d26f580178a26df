media: tuners: tda8290: reduce stack usage with kasan

With CONFIG_KASAN enabled, we get a relatively large stack frame in one function

drivers/media/tuners/tda8290.c: In function 'tda8290_set_params':
drivers/media/tuners/tda8290.c:310:1: warning: the frame size of 1520 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

With CONFIG_KASAN_EXTRA this goes up to

drivers/media/tuners/tda8290.c: In function 'tda8290_set_params':
drivers/media/tuners/tda8290.c:310:1: error: the frame size of 3200 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

We can significantly reduce this by marking local arrays as 'static const', and
this should result in better compiled code for everyone.
