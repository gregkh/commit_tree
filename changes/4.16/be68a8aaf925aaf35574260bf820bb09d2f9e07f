arm64: cpufeature: Fix CTR_EL0 field definitions

Our field definitions for CTR_EL0 suffer from a number of problems:

  - The IDC and DIC fields are missing, which causes us to enable CTR
    trapping on CPUs with either of these returning non-zero values.

  - The ERG is FTR_LOWER_SAFE, whereas it should be treated like CWG as
    FTR_HIGHER_SAFE so that applications can use it to avoid false sharing.

  - [nit] A RES1 field is described as "RAO"

This patch updates the CTR_EL0 field definitions to fix these issues.
