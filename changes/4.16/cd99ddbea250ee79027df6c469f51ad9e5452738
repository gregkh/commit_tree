powerpc/8xx: Only perform perf counting when perf is in use.

In TLB miss handlers, updating the perf counter is only useful
when performing a perf analysis. As it has a noticeable overhead,
let's only do it when needed.

In order to do so, the exit of the miss handlers will be patched
when starting/stopping 'perf': the first register restore
instruction of each exit point will be replaced by a jump to
the counting code.

Once this is done, CONFIG_PPC_8xx_PERF_EVENT becomes useless as
this feature doesn't add any overhead.
