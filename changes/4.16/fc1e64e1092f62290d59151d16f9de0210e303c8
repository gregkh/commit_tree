net/ipv6: Add support for onlink flag

Similar to IPv4 allow routes to be added with the RTNH_F_ONLINK flag.
The onlink option requires a gateway and a nexthop device. Any unicast
gateway is allowed (including IPv4 mapped addresses and unresolved
ones) as long as the gateway is not a local address and if it resolves
it must match the given device.
