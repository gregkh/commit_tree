rcu: Eliminate rcu_irq_enter_disabled()

Now that the irq path uses the rcu_nmi_{enter,exit}() algorithm,
rcu_irq_enter() and rcu_irq_exit() may be used from any context.  There is
thus no need for rcu_irq_enter_disabled() and for the checks using it.
This commit therefore eliminates rcu_irq_enter_disabled().
