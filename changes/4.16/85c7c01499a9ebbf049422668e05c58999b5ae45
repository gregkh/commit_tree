IB/mlx5: Don't advertise RAW QP support in dual port mode

When operating in dual port RoCE mode FW doesn't support steering for
raw QPs on the slave port. They still work on the master port, but
the user has no way of knowing which port is the master. The
capability is reported per device, not per port.
