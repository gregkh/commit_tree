scsi: qla2xxx: Fix double free bug after firmware timeout

This patch is based on Max's original patch.

When the qla2xxx firmware is unavailable, eventually
qla2x00_sp_timeout() is reached, which calls the timeout function and
frees the srb_t instance.

The timeout function always resolves to qla2x00_async_iocb_timeout(),
which invokes another callback function called "done".  All of these
qla2x00_*_sp_done() callbacks also free the srb_t instance; after
returning to qla2x00_sp_timeout(), it is freed again.

The fix is to remove the "sp->free(sp)" call from qla2x00_sp_timeout()
and add it to those code paths in qla2x00_async_iocb_timeout() which
do not already free the object.

This is how it looks like with KASAN:
