net: sched: keep track of offloaded filters and check tc offload feature

During block bind, we need to check tc offload feature. If it is
disabled yet still the block contains offloaded filters, forbid the
bind. Also forbid to register callback for a block that already
contains offloaded filters, as the play back is not supported now.
For keeping track of offloaded filters there is a new counter
introduced, alongside with couple of helpers called from cls_* code.
These helpers set and clear TCA_CLS_FLAGS_IN_HW flag.
