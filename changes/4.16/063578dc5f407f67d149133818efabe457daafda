clk: axi-clkgen: Correctly handle nocount bit in recalc_rate()

If the nocount bit is set the divider is bypassed and the settings for the
divider count should be ignored and a divider value of 1 should be assumed.
Handle this correctly in the driver recalc_rate() callback.

While the driver sets up the part so that the read back dividers values
yield the correct result the power-on reset settings of the part might not
reflect this and hence calling e.g. clk_get_rate() without prior calls to
clk_set_rate() will yield the wrong result.
