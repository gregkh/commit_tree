perf stat: Create the runtime_stat init/exit function

It mainly initializes and releases the rblist which is defined in struct
runtime_stat.

For the original rblist 'runtime_saved_values', it's still kept there
for keeping the patch bisectable.

The rblist 'runtime_saved_values' will be removed in later patch at
switching time.
