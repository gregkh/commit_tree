ARM: dts: sun6i: a31s: bpi-m2: add missing regulators

This patch fixes a bootproblem with the Bananapi M2 board. Since there
are some regulators missing we add them right now. Those values come
from the schematic, below you can find a small overview:

* reg_aldo1:  3,3V, powers the wifi
* reg_aldo2:  2,5V, powers the IO of the RTL8211E
* reg_aldo3:  3,3V, powers the audio

* reg_dldo1:  3,0V, powers the RTL8211E
* reg_dldo2:  2,8V, powers the analog part of the csi
* reg_dldo3:  3,3V, powers misc
* reg_eldo1:  1,8V, powers the csi
* reg_ldo_io1:1,8V, powers the gpio

* reg_dc5ldo: needs to be always on

This patch updates also the vmmc-supply properties on the mmc0 and mmc2
node to use the allready existent regulators.
We can now remove the sunxi-common-regulators.dtsi include since we
don't need it anymore.
