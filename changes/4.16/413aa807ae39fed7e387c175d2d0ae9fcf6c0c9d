KVM: arm/arm64: Reset mapped IRQs on VM reset

We currently don't allow resetting mapped IRQs from userspace, because
their state is controlled by the hardware.  But we do need to reset the
state when the VM is reset, so we provide a function for the 'owner' of
the mapped interrupt to reset the interrupt state.

Currently only the timer uses mapped interrupts, so we call this
function from the timer reset logic.
