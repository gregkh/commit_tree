IB/hfi1: Compute BTH only for RDMA_WRITE_LAST/SEND_LAST packet

In hfi1_rc_rcv(), BTH is computed for all packets received.
However, it's only used for packets received with opcodes
RDMA_WRITE_LAST and SEND_LAST, and it is a costly operation.

Compute BTH only in the RDMA_WRITE_LAST/SEND_LAST code path
and let the compiler handle endianness conversion for bitwise
operations.
