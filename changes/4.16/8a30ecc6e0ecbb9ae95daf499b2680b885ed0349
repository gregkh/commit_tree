Revert "nvme: create 'slaves' and 'holders' entries for hidden controllers"

This reverts commit e9a48034d7d1318ece7d4a235838a86c94db9d68.

The slaves and holders link for the hidden gendisks confuse lsblk so that
it errors out on, or doesn't report the nvme multipath devices.  Given
that we don't need holder relationships for something that can't even be
directly accessed we should just stop creating those links.
