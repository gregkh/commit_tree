Btrfs: fix crash due to not cleaning up tree log block's dirty bits

In cases that the whole fs flips into readonly status due to failures in
critical sections, then log tree's blocks are still dirty, and this leads
to a crash during umount time, the crash is about use-after-free,

umount
 -> close_ctree
    -> stop workers
    -> iput(btree_inode)
       -> iput_final
          -> write_inode_now
	     -> ...
	       -> queue job on stop'd workers
