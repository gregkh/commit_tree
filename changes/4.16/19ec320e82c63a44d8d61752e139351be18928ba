drm/amd/display: Add update flags in to determine surface update type

This way, we can know exactly what triggered the update type we're
looking at, and we can simplify the logic for determining what exactly
needs to be updated in the future.

Also allow a dst rect size increase to go through a medium update,
since that does not require us to increase clock or bandwidth.
