bpf: fix mlock precharge on arraymaps

syzkaller recently triggered OOM during percpu map allocation;
while there is work in progress by Dennis Zhou to add __GFP_NORETRY
semantics for percpu allocator under pressure, there seems also a
missing bpf_map_precharge_memlock() check in array map allocation.

Given today the actual bpf_map_charge_memlock() happens after the
find_and_alloc_map() in syscall path, the bpf_map_precharge_memlock()
is there to bail out early before we go and do the map setup work
when we find that we hit the limits anyway. Therefore add this for
array map as well.

Fixes: 6c9059817432 ("bpf: pre-allocate hash map elements")
Fixes: a10423b87a7e ("bpf: introduce BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY map")
