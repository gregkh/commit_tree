target-core: don't use "const char*" for a buffer that is written to

iscsi_parse_pr_out_transport_id launders the const away via a call to
strstr(), and then modifies the buffer (writing a nul byte) through
the return value. It's cleaner to be honest and simply declare the
parameter as "char*", fixing up the call chain, and allowing us to
drop the cast in the return statement.

Amusingly, the two current callers found it necessary to cast a
non-const pointer to a const.
