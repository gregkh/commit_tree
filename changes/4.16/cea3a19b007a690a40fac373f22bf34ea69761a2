kvm: svm: prepare for new bit definition in nested_ctl

Currently the nested_ctl variable in the vmcb_control_area structure is
used to indicate nested paging support. The nested paging support field
is actually defined as bit 0 of the field. In order to support a new
feature flag the usage of the nested_ctl and nested paging support must
be converted to operate on a single bit.
