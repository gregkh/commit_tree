media: c8sectpfe: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in c8sectpfe_timer_interrupt

_channel_ is being dereferenced before it is null checked, hence there is a
potential null pointer dereference. Fix this by moving the pointer dereference
after _channel_ has been null checked.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
