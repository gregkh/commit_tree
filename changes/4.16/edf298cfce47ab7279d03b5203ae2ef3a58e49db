arm64: cpufeature: __this_cpu_has_cap() shouldn't stop early

this_cpu_has_cap() tests caps->desc not caps->matches, so it stops
walking the list when it finds a 'silent' feature, instead of
walking to the end of the list.

Prior to v4.6's 644c2ae198412 ("arm64: cpufeature: Test 'matches' pointer
to find the end of the list") we always tested desc to find the end of
a capability list. This was changed for dubious things like PAN_NOT_UAO.
v4.7's e3661b128e53e ("arm64: Allow a capability to be checked on
single CPU") added this_cpu_has_cap() using the old desc style test.
