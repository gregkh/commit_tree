ACPI / bus: Parse tables as term_list for Dell XPS 9570 and Precision M5530

The i2c touchpad on Dell XPS 9570 and Precision M5530 doesn't work out
of box.

The touchpad relies on its _INI method to update its _HID value from
XXXX0000 to SYNA2393.

Also, the _STA relies on value of I2CN to report correct status.

Set acpi_gbl_parse_table_as_term_list so the value of I2CN can be
correctly set up, and _INI can get run. The ACPI table in this machine
is designed to get parsed this way.

Also, change the quirk table to a more generic name.
