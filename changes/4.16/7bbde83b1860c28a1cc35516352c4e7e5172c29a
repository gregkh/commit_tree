net: sched: drop qdisc_reset from dev_graft_qdisc

In qdisc_graft_qdisc a "new" qdisc is attached and the 'qdisc_destroy'
operation is called on the old qdisc. The destroy operation will wait
a rcu grace period and call qdisc_rcu_free(). At which point
gso_cpu_skb is free'd along with all stats so no need to zero stats
and gso_cpu_skb from the graft operation itself.

Further after dropping the qdisc locks we can not continue to call
qdisc_reset before waiting an rcu grace period so that the qdisc is
detached from all cpus. By removing the qdisc_reset() here we get
the correct property of waiting an rcu grace period and letting the
qdisc_destroy operation clean up the qdisc correctly.

Note, a refcnt greater than 1 would cause the destroy operation to
be aborted however if this ever happened the reference to the qdisc
would be lost and we would have a memory leak.
