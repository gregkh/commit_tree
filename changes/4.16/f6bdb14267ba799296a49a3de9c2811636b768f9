IB/{core, umad, cm}: Rename ib_init_ah_from_wc to ib_init_ah_attr_from_wc

Currently ib_init_ah_from_wc initializes address handle attributes and
not the address handle object itself.
To avoid confusion between ah_attr vs ah, ib_init_ah_from_wc is
renamed to ib_init_ah_attr_from_wc to reflect that its initialzes
ah_attr.
