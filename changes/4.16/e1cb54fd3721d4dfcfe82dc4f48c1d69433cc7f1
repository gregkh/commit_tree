staging: ccree: make long func call sites readable

The driver was using a function naming scheme
including common prefixes for driver global
functions based on the code module they came from.

The combination of long names with long common
prefixes made the whole thing too long for a human
to parse.

Switch to simple and shorter function naming
scheme. Where required, realign parameters and
add paranthesis for better code readability.
