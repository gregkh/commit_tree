ptrace, seccomp: add support for retrieving seccomp metadata

With the new SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG, we need to be able to extract these
flags for checkpoint restore, since they describe the state of a filter.

So, let's add PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_METADATA, similar to ..._GET_FILTER, which
returns the metadata of the nth filter (right now, just the flags).
Hopefully this will be future proof, and new per-filter metadata can be
added to this struct.
