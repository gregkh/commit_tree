x86/platform/uv/BAU: Add APIC idt entry

BAU uses the old alloc_initr_gate90 method to setup its interrupt. This
fails silently as the BAU vector is in the range of APIC vectors that are
registered to the spurious interrupt handler. As a consequence BAU
broadcasts are not handled, and the broadcast source CPU hangs.

Update BAU to use new idt structure.
