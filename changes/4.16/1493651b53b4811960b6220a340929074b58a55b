fscrypt: split fscrypt_dummy_context_enabled() into supp/notsupp versions

fscrypt_dummy_context_enabled() accesses ->s_cop, which now is only set
when the filesystem is built with encryption support.  This didn't
actually matter because no filesystems called it.  However, it will
start being used soon, so fix it by moving it from fscrypt.h to
fscrypt_supp.h and stubbing it out in fscrypt_notsupp.h.
