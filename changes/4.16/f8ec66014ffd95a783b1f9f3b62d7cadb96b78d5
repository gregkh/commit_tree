signal: Add send_sig_fault and force_sig_fault

The vast majority of signals sent from architecture specific code are
simple faults.  Encapsulate this reality with two helper functions so
that the nit-picky implementation of preparing a siginfo does not need
to be repeated many times on each architecture.

As only some architectures support the trapno field, make the trapno
arguement only present on those architectures.

Similary as ia64 has three fields: imm, flags, and isr that
are specific to it.  Have those arguments always present on ia64
and no where else.

This ensures the architecture specific code always remembers which
fields it needs to pass into the siginfo structure.
