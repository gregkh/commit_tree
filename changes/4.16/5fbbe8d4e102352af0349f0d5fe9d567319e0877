drm/i915: Add pretty printer for runtime part of intel_device_info

During initialization of the runtime part of the intel_device_info
we are dumping that part using DRM_DEBUG_DRIVER mechanism.
As we already have pretty printer for const part of the info,
make similar function for the runtime part and use it separately.

v2: add runtime dump to debugfs (Chris)
