include/linux/bitmap.h: make bitmap_fill() and bitmap_zero() consistent

Behaviour of bitmap_fill() differs from bitmap_zero() in a way how bits
behind bitmap are handed.  bitmap_zero() clears entire bitmap by unsigned
long boundary, while bitmap_fill() mimics bitmap_set().

Here we change bitmap_fill() behaviour to be consistent with bitmap_zero()
and add a note to documentation.

The change might reveal some bugs in the code where unused bits are
handled differently and in such cases bitmap_set() has to be used.
