staging: pi433: Cleanup codestyle, indent statements after case labels

This patch changes the indentation of the statements after case labels.
The linux coding guidelines do not explicitly mentiond this but pretty
much all existing code doesn't put any statements into the same line of
their belonging case labels. Therefore this adapts to the more usual style.

Please note that there is still a lot of > 80 character lines which will
cause checkpatch warnings. This patch does not intent to fix this
already existing issue.
