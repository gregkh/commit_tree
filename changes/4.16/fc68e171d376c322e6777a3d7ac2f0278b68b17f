tcp: revert F-RTO extension to detect more spurious timeouts

This reverts commit 89fe18e44f7ee5ab1c90d0dff5835acee7751427.

While the patch could detect more spurious timeouts, it could cause
poor TCP performance on broken middle-boxes that modifies TCP packets
(e.g. receive window, SACK options). Since the performance gain is
much smaller compared to the potential loss. The best solution is
to fully revert the change.
