swiotlb: add common swiotlb_map_ops

Currently all architectures that want to use swiotlb have to implement
their own dma_map_ops instances.  Provide a generic one based on the
x86 implementation which first calls into dma_direct to try a full blown
direct mapping implementation (including e.g. CMA) before falling back
allocating from the swiotlb buffer.
