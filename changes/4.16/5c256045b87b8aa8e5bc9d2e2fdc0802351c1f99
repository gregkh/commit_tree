ASoC: acpi: fix machine driver selection based on quirk

The ACPI/machine-driver code refactoring introduced in 4.13 introduced
a regression for cases where we need a DMI-based quirk to select the
machine driver (the BIOS reports an invalid HID). The fix is just to
make sure the results of the quirk are actually used.
