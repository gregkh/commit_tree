powerpc/PCI: Deprecate pci_get_bus_and_slot()

pci_get_bus_and_slot() is restrictive such that it assumes domain=0 as
where a PCI device is present. This restricts the device drivers to be
reused for other domain numbers.

Getting ready to remove pci_get_bus_and_slot() function in favor of
pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot().

Use pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() with a domain number of 0 as the code
is not ready to consume multiple domains and existing code used domain
number 0.
