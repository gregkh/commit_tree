block: Add should_fail_bio() for bpf error injection

The classic error injection mechanism, should_fail_request() does not
support use cases where more information is required (from the entire
struct bio, for example).

To that end, this patch introduces should_fail_bio(), which calls
should_fail_request() under the hood but provides a convenient
place for kprobes to hook into if they require the entire struct bio.
This patch also replaces some existing calls to should_fail_request()
with should_fail_bio() with no degradation in performance.
