net: stmmac: do not use a bitwise AND operator with a bool operand

Doing a bitwise AND between a bool and an int is generally not a good idea.
The bool will be promoted to an int with value 0 or 1,
the int is generally regarded as true with a non-zero value,
thus ANDing them has the potential to yield an undesired result.

This commit fixes the following smatch warnings:
