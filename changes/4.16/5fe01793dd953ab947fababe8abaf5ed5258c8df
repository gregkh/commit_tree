KVM: s390: take care of clock-comparator sign control

Missed when enabling the Multiple-epoch facility. If the facility is
installed and the control is set, a sign based comaprison has to be
performed.

Right now we would inject wrong interrupts and ignore interrupt
conditions. Also the sleep time is calculated in a wrong way.
