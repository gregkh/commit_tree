direct-io: Fix sleep in atomic due to sync AIO

Commit e864f39569f4 "fs: add RWF_DSYNC aand RWF_SYNC" added additional
way for direct IO to become synchronous and thus trigger fsync from the
IO completion handler. Then commit 9830f4be159b "fs: Use RWF_* flags for
AIO operations" allowed these flags to be set for AIO as well. However
that commit forgot to update the condition checking whether the IO
completion handling should be defered to a workqueue and thus AIO DIO
with RWF_[D]SYNC set will call fsync() from IRQ context resulting in
sleep in atomic.

Fix the problem by checking directly iocb flags (the same way as it is
done in dio_complete()) instead of checking all conditions that could
lead to IO being synchronous.
