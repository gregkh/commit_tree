slimbus: qcom: add HAS_IOMEM dependency

Below build failure was reported on UML,
ERROR: "devm_ioremap_resource" [drivers/slimbus/slim-qcom-ctrl.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "__ioread32_copy" [drivers/slimbus/slim-qcom-ctrl.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "__iowrite32_copy" [drivers/slimbus/slim-qcom-ctrl.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "devm_ioremap" [drivers/slimbus/slim-qcom-ctrl.ko] undefined!

This patch fixes it by making qcom slimbus depend on HAS_IOMEM, as
these are only defined when HAS_IOMEM is selected.
