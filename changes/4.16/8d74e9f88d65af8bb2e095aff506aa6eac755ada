net: avoid skb_warn_bad_offload on IS_ERR

skb_warn_bad_offload warns when packets enter the GSO stack that
require skb_checksum_help or vice versa. Do not warn on arbitrary
bad packets. Packet sockets can craft many. Syzkaller was able to
demonstrate another one with eth_type games.

In particular, suppress the warning when segmentation returns an
error, which is for reasons other than checksum offload.

See also commit 36c92474498a ("net: WARN if skb_checksum_help() is
called on skb requiring segmentation") for context on this warning.
