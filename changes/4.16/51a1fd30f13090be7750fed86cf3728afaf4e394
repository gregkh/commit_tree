rcu: Make ->dynticks_nesting be a simple counter

Now that ->dynticks_nesting counts only process-level dyntick-idle
entry and exit, there is no need for the elaborate segmented counter
with its guard fields and overflow checking.  This commit therefore
makes ->dynticks_nesting be a simple counter.
