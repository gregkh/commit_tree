platform/x86: intel_telemetry: Fix suspend stats

Suspend stats are not reported consistently due to a limitation in the PMC
firmware. This limitation causes a delay in updating the s0ix counters and
residencies in the telemetry log upon s0ix exit. As a consequence, reading
these counters from the suspend-exit notifier may result in zero read.

This patch fixes this issue by cross-verifying the s0ix residencies from
the GCR TELEM registers in case the counters are not incremented in the
telemetry log after suspend.
