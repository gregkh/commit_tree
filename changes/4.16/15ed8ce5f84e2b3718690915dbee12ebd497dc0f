clk: aspeed: Register gated clocks

The majority of the clocks in the system are gates paired with a reset
controller that holds the IP in reset.

This borrows from clk_hw_register_gate, but registers two 'gates', one
to control the clock enable register and the other to control the reset
IP. This allows us to enforce the ordering:

 1. Place IP in reset
 2. Enable clock
 3. Delay
 4. Release reset

There are some gates that do not have an associated reset; these are
handled by using -1 as the index for the reset.
