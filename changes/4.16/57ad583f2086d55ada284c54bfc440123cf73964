powerpc: Use octal numbers for file permissions

Symbolic macros are unintuitive and hard to read, whereas octal constants
are much easier to interpret.  Replace macros for the basic permission
flags (user/group/other read/write/execute) with numeric constants
instead, across the whole powerpc tree.

Introducing a significant number of changes across the tree for no runtime
benefit isn't exactly desirable, but so long as these macros are still
used in the tree people will keep sending patches that add them.  Not only
are they hard to parse at a glance, there are multiple ways of coming to
the same value (as you can see with 0444 and 0644 in this patch) which
hurts readability.
