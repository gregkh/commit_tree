ALSA: seq: Fix racy pool initializations

ALSA sequencer core initializes the event pool on demand by invoking
snd_seq_pool_init() when the first write happens and the pool is
empty.  Meanwhile user can reset the pool size manually via ioctl
concurrently, and this may lead to UAF or out-of-bound accesses since
the function tries to vmalloc / vfree the buffer.

A simple fix is to just wrap the snd_seq_pool_init() call with the
recently introduced client->ioctl_mutex; as the calls for
snd_seq_pool_init() from other side are always protected with this
mutex, we can avoid the race.
