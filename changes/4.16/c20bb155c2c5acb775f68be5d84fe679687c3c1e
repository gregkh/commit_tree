drm/nouveau: prefer XBGR2101010 for addfb ioctl

Nouveau only exposes support for XBGR2101010. Prior to the atomic
conversion, drm would pass in the wrong format in the framebuffer, but
it was always ignored -- both userspace (xf86-video-nouveau) and the
kernel driver agreed on the layout, so the fact that the format was
wrong didn't matter.

With the atomic conversion, nouveau all of a sudden started caring about
the exact format, and so the previously-working code in
xf86-video-nouveau no longer functioned since the (internally-assigned)
format from the addfb ioctl was wrong.

This change adds infrastructure to allow a drm driver to specify that it
prefers the XBGR format variant for the addfb ioctl, and makes nouveau's
nv50 display driver set it. (Prior gens had no support for 30bpp at all.)
