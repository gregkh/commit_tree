IB/qib: Fix comparison error with qperf compare/swap test

This failure exists with qib:

ver_rc_compare_swap:
mismatch, sequence 2, expected 123456789abcdef, got 0

The request builder was using the incorrect inlines to
build the request header resulting in incorrect data
in the atomic header.

Fix by using the appropriate inlines to create the request.
