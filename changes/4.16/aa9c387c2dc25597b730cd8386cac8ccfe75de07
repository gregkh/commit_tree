ASoC: rt5645: Set card long_name for GPD win / pocket

The GPD win and pocket devices both use the same codec setup and both
have too generic dmi strings making snd_soc_set_dmi_name() not work.

As these devices have only a single speaker we want a separate ucm
file for them, which requires a unique long_name, use the existing
GPD quirk handling to also provide a unique long_name.
