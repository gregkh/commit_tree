drm/i915/execlists: Delay writing to ELSP until HW has processed the previous write

The hardware needs some time to process the information received in the
ExecList Submission Port, and expects us to not write anything more until
it has 'acknowledged' this new submission by sending an IDLE_ACTIVE or
PREEMPTED CSB event.

If we do not follow this, the driver could write new data into the ELSP
before HW had finishing fetching the previous one, putting us in
'undefined behaviour' space.

This seems to be the problem causing the spurious PREEMPTED & COMPLETE
events after a COMPLETE like the one below:

[] vcs0: sw rd pointer = 2, hw wr pointer = 0, current 'head' = 3.
[] vcs0:  Execlist CSB[0]: 0x00000018 _ 0x00000007
[] vcs0:  Execlist CSB[1]: 0x00000001 _ 0x00000000
[] vcs0:  Execlist CSB[2]: 0x00000018 _ 0x00000007  <<< COMPLETE
[] vcs0:  Execlist CSB[3]: 0x00000012 _ 0x00000007  <<< PREEMPTED & COMPLETE
[] vcs0:  Execlist CSB[4]: 0x00008002 _ 0x00000006
[] vcs0:  Execlist CSB[5]: 0x00000014 _ 0x00000006

The ELSP writes that lead to this CSB sequence show that the HW hadn't
started executing the previous execlist (the one with only ctx 0x6) by the
time the new one was submitted; this is a bit more clear in the data
show in the EXECLIST_STATUS register at the time of the ELSP write.

[] vcs0: ELSP[0] = 0x0_0        [execlist1] - status_reg = 0x0_302
[] vcs0: ELSP[1] = 0x6_fedb2119 [execlist0] - status_reg = 0x0_8302

[] vcs0: ELSP[2] = 0x7_fedaf119 [execlist1] - status_reg = 0x0_8308
[] vcs0: ELSP[3] = 0x6_fedb2119 [execlist0] - status_reg = 0x7_8308

Note that having to wait for this ack does not disable lite-restores,
although it may reduce their numbers.
