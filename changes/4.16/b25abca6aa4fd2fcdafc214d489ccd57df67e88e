can: m_can: Remove check for version when allocating m_can net device

Currently the m_can version is used to set the tx_fifo_count to 1 when
allocating the net device. However, this is redundant as a value of 1
for the tx_fifo_count needs to be provided in the bosch,mram-cfg
property of the device tree node anyway.

Therefore, remove check for version when allocating the net device.
