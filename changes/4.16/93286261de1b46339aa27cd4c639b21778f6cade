x86/hyperv: Reenlightenment notifications support

Hyper-V supports Live Migration notification. This is supposed to be used
in conjunction with TSC emulation: when a VM is migrated to a host with
different TSC frequency for some short period the host emulates the
accesses to TSC and sends an interrupt to notify about the event. When the
guest is done updating everything it can disable TSC emulation and
everything will start working fast again.

These notifications weren't required until now as Hyper-V guests are not
supposed to use TSC as a clocksource: in Linux the TSC is even marked as
unstable on boot. Guests normally use 'tsc page' clocksource and host
updates its values on migrations automatically.

Things change when with nested virtualization: even when the PV
clocksources (kvm-clock or tsc page) are passed through to the nested
guests the TSC frequency and frequency changes need to be know..

Hyper-V Top Level Functional Specification (as of v5.0b) wrongly specifies
EAX:BIT(12) of CPUID:0x40000009 as the feature identification bit. The
right one to check is EAX:BIT(13) of CPUID:0x40000003. I was assured that
the fix in on the way.
