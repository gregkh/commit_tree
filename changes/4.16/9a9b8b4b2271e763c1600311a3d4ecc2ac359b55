perf tools: Create function to perform multiple time range checking

Previous patch supports the multiple time range.

For example, select the first and second 10% time slices.
perf report --time 10%/1,10%/2

We need a function to check if a timestamp is in the ranges of
[0, 10%) and [10%, 20%].

Note that it includes the last element in [10%, 20%] but it doesn't
include the last element in [0, 10%). It's to avoid the overlap.

This patch implments a new function perf_time__ranges_skip_sample
for this checking.

Change log:

v4: Let perf_time__ranges_skip_sample be compatible with
    perf_time__skip_sample when only one time range.
