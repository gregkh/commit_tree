cgroup, docs: document the root cgroup behavior of cpu and io controllers

Currently, cgroups v2 documentation contains only a generic remark that
"How resource consumption in the root cgroup is governed is up to each
controller", which isn't really telling users much, who need to dig in the
code and / or commit messages to learn the exact behavior.

In cgroups v1 at least the blkio controller had its operation with respect
to competition between child threads and child cgroups documented in
blkio-controller.txt, with references to cfq-iosched.txt.
Also, cgroups v2 documentation describes v1 behavior of both cpu and
blkio controllers in an "Issues with v1" section.

Let's document this behavior also for cgroups v2 to make life easier for
users.
