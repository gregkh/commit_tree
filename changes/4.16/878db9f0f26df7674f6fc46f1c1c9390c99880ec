pkt_cls: add new tc cls helper to check offload flag and chain index

Very few (mlxsw) upstream drivers seem to allow offload of chains
other than 0.  Save driver developers typing and add a helper for
checking both if ethtool's TC offload flag is on and if chain is 0.
This helper will set the extack appropriately in both error cases.
