scsi: hisi_sas: add v2 hw port AXI error handling support

Add port AXI errors handling for v2 hw. We do host controller reset for such
errors.

Besides, change port muli-bits ECC error handling, and we should also do host
reset for such error. So, this patch put them in the same struct with port AXI
error.
