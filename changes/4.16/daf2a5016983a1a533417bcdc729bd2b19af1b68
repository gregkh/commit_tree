virtio_blk: print capacity at probe time

Print the capacity of the block device when the driver is probed.  Many
users expect this since SCSI disks (sd) do it.  Moreover, kernel dmesg
output is the primary source of troubleshooting information so it's
helpful to include the disk size there.

The capacity is already printed by virtio_blk when a resize event
occurs.  Extract the code and reuse it from virtblk_probe().

This patch also adds the block device name to the message so it can be
correlated with a specific device:

  virtio_blk virtio0: [vda] 20971520 512-byte logical blocks (10.7 GB/10.0 GiB)
