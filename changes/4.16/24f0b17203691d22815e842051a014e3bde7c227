ovl: whiteout orphan index entries on mount

Orphan index entries are non-dir index entries whose union nlink count
dropped to zero. With index=on, orphan index entries are removed on
mount. With NFS export feature enabled, orphan index entries are replaced
with white out index entries to block future open by handle from opening
the lower file.

When dir index has a stale 'upper' xattr, we assume that the upper dir
was removed and we treat the dir index as orphan entry that needs to be
whited out or removed.
