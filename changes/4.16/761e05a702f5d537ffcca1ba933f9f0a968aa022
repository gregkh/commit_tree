drm: Check for lessee in DROP_MASTER ioctl

Don't let a lessee control what the current DRM master is set to;
that's the job of the "real" master. Otherwise, the lessee would
disable all access to master operations for the owner and all lessees
under it.

This matches the same check made in the SET_MASTER ioctl.
