dm raid: fix deadlock caused by premature md_stop_writes()

md_stop_writes() is called in raid_presuspend() causing deadlocks on
bios submitted afterwards -- which happens on loaded raid sets with
conversion requests.

Fix by moving md_stop_writes() to raid_postsuspend().  NOTE: when the
recovery's frozen (MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN), writes haven't been started (or
are already stopped) so don't stop them again.

Also remove superfluous readonly setting.
