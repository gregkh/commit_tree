gpio: of: Add special quirk to parse regulator flags

While most GPIOs are indicated to be active low or open drain using
their twocell flags, we have legacy regulator bindings to take into
account.

Add a quirk respecting the special boolean active-high and open
drain flags when parsing regulator nodes for GPIOs.

This makes it possible to get rid of duplicated inversion semantics
handling in the regulator core and any regulator drivers parsing
and handling this separately.

Unfortunately the old regulator inversion semantics are specified
such that the presence or absence of "enable-active-high" solely
controls the semantics, so we cannot deprecate this in favor
of the phandle-provided inversion flag, instead any such phandle
inversion flag provided in the second cell of a GPIO handle must be
actively ignored, so we print a warning to contain the situation
and make things easy for the users.
