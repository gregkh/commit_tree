drm/amdkfd: Add crash protection in debugger register path

After debugger is registered, the pqm_destroy_queue fails because is_debug
is true, the queue should not be removed from process_queue_list since
the count is not reduced.

Test application calls debugger unregister without register debugger, add
null pointer check protection to avoid crash for this case
