i40evf: remove flush_scheduled_work call in i40evf_remove

flush_schedule_work blocks until completion of all scheduled
work items in global work-queue. This can cause deadlock in some
cases. i40evf_remove() cleans up necessary work items with
cancel_delayed_work_sync and cancel_work_sync. This fix removes
flush_schedule_work call inside i40evf_remove().
