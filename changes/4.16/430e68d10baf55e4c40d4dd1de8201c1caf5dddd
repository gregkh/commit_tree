bpf: export function to write into verifier log buffer

Rename the BPF verifier `verbose()` to `bpf_verifier_log_write()` and
export it, so that other components (in particular, drivers for BPF
offload) can reuse the user buffer log to dump error messages at
verification time.

Renaming `verbose()` was necessary in order to avoid a name so generic
to be exported to the global namespace. However to prevent too much pain
for backports, the calls to `verbose()` in the kernel BPF verifier were
not changed. Instead, use function aliasing to make `verbose` point to
`bpf_verifier_log_write`. Another solution could consist in making a
wrapper around `verbose()`, but since it is a variadic function, I don't
see a clean way without creating two identical wrappers, one for the
verifier and one to export.
