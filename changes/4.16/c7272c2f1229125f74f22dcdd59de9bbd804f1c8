net: ipv4: don't allow setting net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu below 68

According to RFC 1191 sections 3 and 4, ICMP frag-needed messages
indicating an MTU below 68 should be rejected:

    A host MUST never reduce its estimate of the Path MTU below 68
    octets.

and (talking about ICMP frag-needed's Next-Hop MTU field):

    This field will never contain a value less than 68, since every
    router "must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets without
    fragmentation".

Furthermore, by letting net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu be set to negative
values, we can end up with a very large PMTU when (-1) is cast into u32.

Let's also make ip_rt_min_pmtu a u32, since it's only ever compared to
unsigned ints.
