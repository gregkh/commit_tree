bcache: writeback: properly order backing device IO

Writeback keys are presently iterated and dispatched for writeback in
order of the logical block address on the backing device.  Multiple may
be, in parallel, read from the cache device and then written back
(especially when there are contiguous I/O).

However-- there was no guarantee with the existing code that the writes
would be issued in LBA order, as the reads from the cache device are
often re-ordered.  In turn, when writing back quickly, the backing disk
often has to seek backwards-- this slows writeback and increases
utilization.

This patch introduces an ordering mechanism that guarantees that the
original order of issue is maintained for the write portion of the I/O.
Performance for writeback is significantly improved when there are
multiple contiguous keys or high writeback rates.
