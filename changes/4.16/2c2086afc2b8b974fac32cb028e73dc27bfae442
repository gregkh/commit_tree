block: Protect less code with sysfs_lock in blk_{un,}register_queue()

The __blk_mq_register_dev(), blk_mq_unregister_dev(),
elv_register_queue() and elv_unregister_queue() calls need to be
protected with sysfs_lock but other code in these functions not.
Hence protect only this code with sysfs_lock. This patch fixes a
locking inversion issue in blk_unregister_queue() and also in an
error path of blk_register_queue(): it is not allowed to hold
sysfs_lock around the kobject_del(&q->kobj) call.
