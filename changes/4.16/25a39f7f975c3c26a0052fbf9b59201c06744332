hv_netvsc: Use the num_online_cpus() for channel limit

Since we no longer localize channel/CPU affiliation within one NUMA
node, num_online_cpus() is used as the number of channel cap, instead of
the number of processors in a NUMA node.

This patch allows a bigger range for tuning the number of channels.
