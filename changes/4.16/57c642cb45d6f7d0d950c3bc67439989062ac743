media: cec: move cec autorepeat handling to rc-core

CEC autorepeat is different than other protocols. Autorepeat is triggered
by the first repeated user control pressed CEC message, rather than a
fixed REP_DELAY.

This change also does away with the KEY_UP event directly after the first
KEY_DOWN event, which was used to stop autorepeat from starting.

See commit a9a249a2c997 ("media: cec: fix remote control passthrough")
for the original change.
