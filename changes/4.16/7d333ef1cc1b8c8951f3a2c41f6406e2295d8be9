clk: sunxi-ng: Support fixed post-dividers on NM style clocks

On the A83T, the audio PLL should have its div1 set to 0, or /1, and
div2 set to 1, or /2. This setting is the default, and is required
to match the sigma-delta modulation parameters from the BSP kernel.

To do this, we first add fixed post-divider to the NM style clocks,
which is the type of clock the audio PLL clock is modeled into.
