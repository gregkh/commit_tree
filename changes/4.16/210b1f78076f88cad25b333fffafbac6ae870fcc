IB/mlx5: When not in dual port RoCE mode, use provided port as native

The series that introduced dual port RoCE mode assumed that we don't have
a dual port HCA that use the mlx5 driver, this is not the case for
Connect-IB HCAs. This reasoning led to assigning 1 as the native port
index which causes issue when the second port is used.

For example query_pkey() when called on the second port will return values
of the first port. Make sure that we assign the right port index as the
native port index.
