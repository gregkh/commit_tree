ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Request IRQ late only after all context are initialized

Sometimes during boot, panic is observed at sst_dsp_shim_read_unlocked().
This happens when interrupt occurs before the context is initialized. So
move the irq initialization only after the context is initialized
completely.
