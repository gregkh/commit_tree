vmxnet3: use correct flag to indicate LRO feature

'Commit 45dac1d6ea04 ("vmxnet3: Changes for vmxnet3 adapter version 2
(fwd)")' introduced a flag "lro" in structure vmxnet3_adapter which is
used to indicate whether LRO is enabled or not. However, the patch
did not set the flag and hence it was never exercised.

So, when LRO is enabled, it resulted in poor TCP performance due to
delayed acks. This issue is seen with packets which are larger than
the mss getting a delayed ack rather than an immediate ack, thus
resulting in high latency.

This patch removes the lro flag and directly uses device features
against NETIF_F_LRO to check if lro is enabled.
