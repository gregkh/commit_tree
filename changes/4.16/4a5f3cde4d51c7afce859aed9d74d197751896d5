Drivers: hv: vmbus: Remove x86-isms from arch independent drivers

hv_is_hypercall_page_setup() is used to check if Hyper-V is
initialized, but a 'hypercall page' is an x86 implementation detail
that isn't necessarily present on other architectures. Rename to the
architecture independent hv_is_hyperv_initialized() and add check
that x86_hyper is pointing to Hyper-V.  Use this function instead of
direct references to x86-specific data structures in vmbus_drv.c,
and remove now redundant call in hv_init(). Also remove 'x86' from
the string name passed to cpuhp_setup_state().
