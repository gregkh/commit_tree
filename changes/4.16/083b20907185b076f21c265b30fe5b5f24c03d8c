powerpc/bpf/jit: Fix 32-bit JIT for seccomp_data access

I am using SECCOMP to filter syscalls on a ppc32 platform, and noticed
that the JIT compiler was failing on the BPF even though the
interpreter was working fine.

The issue was that the compiler was missing one of the instructions
used by SECCOMP, so here is a patch to enable JIT for that
instruction.
