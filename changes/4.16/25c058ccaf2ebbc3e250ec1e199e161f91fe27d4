drm: Allow determining if current task is output poll worker

Introduce a helper to determine if the current task is an output poll
worker.

This allows us to fix a long-standing deadlock in several DRM drivers
wherein the ->runtime_suspend callback waits for the output poll worker
to finish and the worker in turn calls a ->detect callback which waits
for runtime suspend to finish.  The ->detect callback is invoked from
multiple call sites and waiting for runtime suspend to finish is the
correct thing to do except if it's executing in the context of the
worker.

v2: Expand kerneldoc to specifically mention deadlock between
    output poll worker and autosuspend worker as use case. (Lyude)
