selftests/vm: move 128TB mmap boundary test to generic directory

Architectures like PPC64 support mmap hint address based large address
space selection.  This test can be run on those architectures too.  Move
the test from the x86 selftests to selftest/vm so that other
architectures can use it too.

We also add a few new test scenarios in this patch.  We do test a few
boundary conditions before we do a high address mmap.  PPC64 uses the
address limit to validate the address in the fault path.  We had bugs in
this area w.r.t SLB fault handling before we updated the addess limit.

We also touch the allocated space to make sure we don't have any bugs in
the fault handling path.
