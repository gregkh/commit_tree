ptrace, seccomp: tweak get_metadata behavior slightly

Previously if users passed a small size for the input structure size, they
would get get odd behavior. It doesn't make sense to pass a structure
smaller than at least filter_off size, so let's just give -EINVAL in this
case.

This changes userspace visible behavior, but was only introduced in commit
26500475ac1b ("ptrace, seccomp: add support for retrieving seccomp
metadata") in 4.16-rc2, so should be safe to change if merged before then.
