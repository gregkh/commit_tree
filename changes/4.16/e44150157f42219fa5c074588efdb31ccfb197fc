afs: Add missing afs_put_cell()

afs_alloc_volume() needs to release the cell ref it obtained in the case of
an error.  Fix this by adding an afs_put_cell() call into the error path.

This can triggered when a lookup for a cell in a dynamic root or an
autocell mount returns an error whilst trying to look up the server (such
as ENOMEDIUM).  This results in an assertion failure oops when the module
is unloaded due to outstanding refs on a cell record.
