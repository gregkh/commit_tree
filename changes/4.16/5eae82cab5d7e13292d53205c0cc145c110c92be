powerpc/pseries: lift RTAS limit for radix

With the previous patch to switch to 64-bit mode after returning from
RTAS and before doing any memory accesses, the RMA limit need not be
clamped to 1GB to avoid RTAS bugs.

Keep the 1GB limit for older firmware (although this is more of a kernel
concern than RTAS), and remove it starting with POWER9.
