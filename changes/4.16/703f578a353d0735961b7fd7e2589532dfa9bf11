nfp: fix kdoc warnings on nested structures

Commit 84ce5b987783 ("scripts: kernel-doc: improve nested logic to
handle multiple identifiers") improved the handling of nested structure
definitions in scripts/kernel-doc, and changed the expected format of
documentation.  This causes new warnings to appear on W=1 builds.

Only comment changes.
