ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: Add dts file for Libre Computer Board ALL-H3-CC H3 ver.

The Libre Computer Board ALL-H3-CC from Libre Technology is a Raspberry
Pi B+ form factor single board computer based on the Allwinner H3 SoC.
The board has 1GB DDR3 SDRAM, provided by 4 2Gb chips. The mounting holes
and connectors are in the exact same position as on the Raspberry Pi B+.

Raspberry Pi B+ like peripherals supported on this board include:

  - Power input through micro-USB connector (without USB OTG)
  - Native 100 Mbps ethernet using the internal PHY, as opposed to
    USB-based on the RPi
  - 4x USB 2.0 host ports, directly connected to the SoC, as opposed to
    being connected through a USB 2.0 hub on the RPi
  - TV and audio output on a 3.5mm TRRS jack
  - HDMI output
  - Micro-SD card slot
  - Standard RPi B+ GPIO header, with the standard peripherals routed to
    the same pins.

    * 5V, 3.3V power, and ground
    * I2C0 on the H3 is routed to I2C1 pins on the RPi header
    * I2C1 on the H3 is routed to I2C0 pins on the RPi header
    * UART1 on the H3 is routed to UART0 pins on the RPi header
    * SPI0 on the H3 is routed to SPI0 pins on the RPi header,
      with GPIO pin PA17 replacing the missing Chip Select 1
    * I2S1 on the H3 is routed to PCM pins on the RPi header

  - Additional peripherals from the H3 are available on different pins.
    These include I2S0, JTAG, PWM1, SPDIF, SPI1, and UART3

In addition, there are a number of new features:

  - Console UART header
  - Consumer IR receiver
  - Camera interface (not compatible with RPi)
  - Onboard microphone
  - eMMC expansion module port
  - Heatsink mounting holes
  - Power button

The power button requires corresponding software for the embedded
coprocessor to properly function.

This patch adds a dts file for this board that enables all "onboard"
peripherals currently supported. This means no display or camera
support.
