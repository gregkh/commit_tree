drm/amdkfd: Add topology support for dGPUs

Generate and parse VCRAT tables for dGPUs in kfd_topology_add_device.

Some information that isn't available in the CRAT table is patched
into the topology after parsing.

HSA_CAP_DOORBELL_TYPE_1_0 is dependent on the ASIC feature
CP_HQD_PQ_CONTROL.SLOT_BASED_WPTR, which was not introduced in VI
until Carrizo. Report HSA_CAP_DOORBELL_TYPE_PRE_1_0 on Tonga ASICs.

v2: Added #include <linux/pci.h> to kfd_crat.c to make it compile
