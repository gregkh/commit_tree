drm/i915: Prevent unbounded wm results in g4x_compute_wm()

Smatch warns of

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:1161 g4x_compute_wm() warn: signedness bug returning '(-33554430)'

which is a result of it believing that wm may be INT_MAX following
g4x_tlb_miss_wa(). Just declaring g4x_tlb_miss_wa() as returning an
unsigned integer is not sufficient, we need to tell smatch that wm itself
is unsigned for it to not worry. So mark up the locals we expect to be
non-negative, and so silence smatch.

v2: Mark up vlv_compute_wm_level() as unsigned similarly.
