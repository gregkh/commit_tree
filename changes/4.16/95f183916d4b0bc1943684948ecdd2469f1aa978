dma-direct: retry allocations using GFP_DMA for small masks

If an attempt to allocate memory succeeded, but isn't inside the
supported DMA mask, retry the allocation with GFP_DMA set as a
last resort.

Based on the x86 code, but an off by one error in what is now
dma_coherent_ok has been fixed vs the x86 code.
