Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_disable()

On ->setup, pm_runtime_enable() is only called if a valid IRQ was found,
but on ->close(), pm_runtime_disable() is called unconditionally.
Disablement of runtime PM is recorded in a counter, so every
pm_runtime_disable() needs to be balanced.  Fix it.
