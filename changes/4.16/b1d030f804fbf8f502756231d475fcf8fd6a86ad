mtd: sharpslpart: fix overflow on block_adr calculation

Multiplying block_num and mtd->erasesize may potentially overflow
as they are both unsigned ints and so the multiplication is evaluated
in unsigned int arithmetic.  Cast block_adr to off_t to ensure
multiplication is off_t sized to avoid any potential overflow.
