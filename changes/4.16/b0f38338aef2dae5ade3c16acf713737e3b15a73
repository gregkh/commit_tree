netfilter: reduce size of hook entry point locations

struct net contains:

struct nf_hook_entries __rcu *hooks[NFPROTO_NUMPROTO][NF_MAX_HOOKS];

which store the hook entry point locations for the various protocol
families and the hooks.

Using array results in compact c code when doing accesses, i.e.
  x = rcu_dereference(net->nf.hooks[pf][hook]);

but its also wasting a lot of memory, as most families are
not used.

So split the array into those families that are used, which
are only 5 (instead of 13).  In most cases, the 'pf' argument is
constant, i.e. gcc removes switch statement.

struct net before:
 /* size: 5184, cachelines: 81, members: 46 */
after:
 /* size: 4672, cachelines: 73, members: 46 */
