clk: sunxi-ng: Support fixed post-dividers on MP style clocks

On the A64, the MMC module clocks are fixed in the new timing mode,
i.e. they do not have a bit to select the mode. These clocks have
a 2x divider somewhere between the clock and the MMC module.

To be consistent with other SoCs supporting the new timing mode,
we model the 2x divider as a fixed post-divider on the MMC module
clocks.

To do this, we first add fixed post-divider to the MP style clocks,
which the MMC module clocks are.
