staging: wlan-ng: add SPDX identifiers to all wlan-ng driver files

It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.

Update the wlan-ng driver files with the correct SPDX license identifier
based on the license text in the file itself.  The SPDX identifier is a
legally binding shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler
plate text.

This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.
