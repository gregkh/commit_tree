mtd: nand: fsl_ifc: Fix eccstat array overflow for IFC ver >= 2.0.0

Number of ECC status registers i.e. (ECCSTATx) has been increased in IFC
version 2.0.0 due to increase in SRAM size. This is causing eccstat
array to over flow.

So, replace eccstat array with u32 variable to make it fail-safe and
independent of number of ECC status registers or SRAM size.
