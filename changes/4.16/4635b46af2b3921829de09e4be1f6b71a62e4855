f2fs: fix potential hangtask in f2fs_trace_pid

As Jia-Ju Bai reported:

"According to fs/f2fs/trace.c, the kernel module may sleep under a spinlock.
The function call path is:
f2fs_trace_pid (acquire the spinlock)
   f2fs_radix_tree_insert
     cond_resched --> may sleep

I do not find a good way to fix it, so I only report.
This possible bug is found by my static analysis tool (DSAC) and my code
review."

Obviously, it's problemetic to schedule in critical region of spinlock,
which will cause uninterruptable sleep if there is no waker.

This patch changes to use mutex lock intead of spinlock to avoid this
condition.
