membarrier/x86: Provide core serializing command

There are two places where core serialization is needed by membarrier:

1) When returning from the membarrier IPI,
2) After scheduler updates curr to a thread with a different mm, before
   going back to user-space, since the curr->mm is used by membarrier to
   check whether it needs to send an IPI to that CPU.

x86-32 uses IRET as return from interrupt, and both IRET and SYSEXIT to go
back to user-space. The IRET instruction is core serializing, but not
SYSEXIT.

x86-64 uses IRET as return from interrupt, which takes care of the IPI.
However, it can return to user-space through either SYSRETL (compat
code), SYSRETQ, or IRET. Given that SYSRET{L,Q} is not core serializing,
we rely instead on write_cr3() performed by switch_mm() to provide core
serialization after changing the current mm, and deal with the special
case of kthread -> uthread (temporarily keeping current mm into
active_mm) by adding a sync_core() in that specific case.

Use the new sync_core_before_usermode() to guarantee this.
