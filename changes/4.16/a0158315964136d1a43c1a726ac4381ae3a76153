xfs: Show realtime device stats on statfs calls if realtime flags set

- Reports realtime device free blocks in statfs calls if (realtime)
  inheritance bit is set on the inode of directory, or realtime flag
  in the case of files.  This is a bit more intuitive, especially for
  use-cases which are using a much larger device for the realtime device.
- Add XFS_IS_REALTIME_MOUNT option to gate based on the existence of a
  realtime device on the mount, similar to the XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE
  option.
