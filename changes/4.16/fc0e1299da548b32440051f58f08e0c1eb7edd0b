arm64: mm: Add arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0 helper

In order for code such as TLB invalidation to operate efficiently when
the decision to map the kernel at EL0 is determined at runtime, this
patch introduces a helper function, arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0, to
determine whether or not the kernel is mapped whilst running in userspace.

Currently, this just reports the value of CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0,
but will later be hooked up to a fake CPU capability using a static key.
