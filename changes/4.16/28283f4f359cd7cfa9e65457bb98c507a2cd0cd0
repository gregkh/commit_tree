drm/i915: Do not rely on wm preservation for ILK watermarks

The original intent was to preserve watermarks as much as possible
in intel_pipe_wm.raw_wm, and put the validated ones in intel_pipe_wm.wm.

It seems this approach is insufficient and we don't always preserve
the raw watermarks, so just use the atomic iterator we're already using
to get a const pointer to all bound planes on the crtc.
