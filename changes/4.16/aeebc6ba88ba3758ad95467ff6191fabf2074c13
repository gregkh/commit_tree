watchdog: hpwdt: fix unused variable warning

The new hpwdt_my_nmi() function is used conditionally, which produces
a harmless warning in some configurations:

drivers/watchdog/hpwdt.c:478:12: error: 'hpwdt_my_nmi' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

This moves it inside of the #ifdef that protects its caller, to silence
the warning.
