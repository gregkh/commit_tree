staging: lustre: lnet: convert selftest to use workqueues

Instead of the cfs workitem library, use workqueues.

As lnet wants to provide a cpu mask of allowed cpus, it
needs to be a WQ_UNBOUND work queue so that tasks can
run on cpus other than where they were submitted.

This patch also exported apply_workqueue_attrs() which is
a documented part of the workqueue API, that isn't currently
exported.  lustre needs it to allow workqueue thread to be limited
to a subset of CPUs.
