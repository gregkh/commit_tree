mm/swap.c: make functions and their kernel-doc agree (again)

There was a conflict between the commit e02a9f048ef7 ("mm/swap.c: make
functions and their kernel-doc agree") and the commit f144c390f905 ("mm:
docs: fix parameter names mismatch") that both tried to fix mismatch
betweeen pagevec_lookup_entries() parameter names and their description.

Since nr_entries is a better name for the parameter, fix the description
again.
