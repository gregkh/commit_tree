bpf: move event_output to const_size_or_zero for xdp/skb as well

Similar rationale as in a60dd35d2e39 ("bpf: change bpf_perf_event_output
arg5 type to ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO"), change the type to CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO
such that we can better deal with optimized code. No changes needed in
bpf_event_output() as it can also deal with 0 size entirely (e.g. as only
wake-up signal with empty frame in perf RB, or packet dumps w/o meta data
as another such possibility).
