shmem: unexport shmem_add_seals()/shmem_get_seals()

Patch series "memfd: add sealing to hugetlb-backed memory", v3.

Recently, Mike Kravetz added hugetlbfs support to memfd.  However, he
didn't add sealing support.  One of the reasons to use memfd is to have
shared memory sealing when doing IPC or sharing memory with another
process with some extra safety.  qemu uses shared memory & hugetables
with vhost-user (used by dpdk), so it is reasonable to use memfd now
instead for convenience and security reasons.

This patch (of 9):

The functions are called through shmem_fcntl() only.  And no danger in
removing the EXPORTs as the routines only work with shmem file structs.
