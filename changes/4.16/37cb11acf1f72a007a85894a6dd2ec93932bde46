RDMA/bnxt_re: Add SRQ support for Broadcom adapters

Shared receive queue (SRQ) is defined as a pool of
receive buffers shared among multiple QPs which belong

Use of SRQ reduces the memory foot print of IB applications.

Broadcom adapters support SRQ, adding code-changes to enable
shared receive queue.
