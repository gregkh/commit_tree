can: peak_usb: remove some 'struct timeval' users

We want to remove 'struct timeval' and related interfaces since this is
generally not safe for use beyond 2038.

For peak_usb, we can simplify the internal interface by using ktime_t
directly. This should not change any behavior, but it avoids a few
conversions.
