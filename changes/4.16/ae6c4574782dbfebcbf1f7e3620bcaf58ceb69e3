drm/i915: Force the switch to the i915->kernel_context

In the next few patches, we will have a hard requirement that we emit a
context-switch to the perma-pinned i915->kernel_context (so that we can
save the HW state using that context-switch). As the first context
itself may be classed as a kernel context, we want to be explicit in our
comparison. For an extra-layer of finesse, we can check the last
unretired context on the engine; as well as the last retired context
when idle.

v2: verbose verbosity
v3: Always force the switch, even when the engine is idle, and update
the assert that this happens before suspend.
