ixgbe: Perform reinit any time number of VFs change

If the number of VFs are changed we need to reinitialize the part since the
offset for the device and the number of pools will be incorrect. Without
this change we can end up seeing Tx hangs and dropped Rx frames for
incoming traffic.

In addition we should drop the code that is arbitrarily changing the
default pool and queue configuration. Instead we should wait until the port
is reset and reconfigured via ixgbe_sriov_reinit.
