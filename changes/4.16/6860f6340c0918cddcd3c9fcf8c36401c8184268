kasan: detect invalid frees for large mempool objects

Detect frees of pointers into middle of mempool objects.

I did a one-off test, but it turned out to be very tricky, so I reverted
it.  First, mempool does not call kasan_poison_kfree() unless allocation
function fails.  I stubbed an allocation function to fail on second and
subsequent allocations.  But then mempool stopped to call
kasan_poison_kfree() at all, because it does it only when allocation
function is mempool_kmalloc().  We could support this special failing
test allocation function in mempool, but it also can't live with kasan
tests, because these are in a module.
