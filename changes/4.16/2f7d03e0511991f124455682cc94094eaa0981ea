powerpc/mm/drmem: Fix unexpected flag value in ibm,dynamic-memory-v2

Memory addtion and removal by count and indexed-count methods
temporarily mark the LMBs that are being added/removed by a special
flag value DRMEM_LMB_RESERVED. Accessing flags value directly at a few
places without proper accessor method is causing two unexpected
side-effects:

- DRMEM_LMB_RESERVED bit is becoming part of the flags word of
  drconf_cell_v2 entries in ibm,dynamic-memory-v2 DT property.
- This results in extra drconf_cell entries in ibm,dynamic-memory-v2.
  For example if 1G memory is added, it leads to one entry for 3 LMBs
  and 1 separate entry for the last LMB. All the 4 LMBs should be
  defined by one entry here.

Fix this by always accessing the flags by its accessor method
drmem_lmb_flags().
