ibmvnic: Check for NULL skb's in NAPI poll routine

After introduction of commit d0869c0071e4, there were some instances of
RX queue entries from a previous session (before the device was closed
and reopened) returned to the NAPI polling routine. Since the corresponding
socket buffers were freed, this resulted in a panic on reopen. Include
a check for a NULL skb here to avoid this.
