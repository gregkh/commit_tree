perf symbols: Using O_CLOEXEC in do_open

I've meet a strange behavior with these commands on my gentoo box:

1: perf kmem record
2: CTRL-C to stop 1
3: perf report
4: "Enter", "Enter", "Run scripts for all samples",
   "event_analyzing_sample".

Then 'perf report' says:

  "
  No kallsyms or vmlinux with build-id xxxx was found
  /lib/modules/4.10.0+/build/vmlinux with build id xxxx not found,
  continuing without symbols
  ".

It is strange because I am sure /lib/modules/4.10.0+/build/vmlinux is
right for perf.data.

After digging, I found out the reason is that "perf report" generates
many open fds, then "script_browse" uses popen to run "perf script"
which run out of open files.

The gentoo box has a small default value for "max open files", 1024.
Yes, "ulimit -n " with a bigger number could fix it, but I think that
using O_CLOEXEC in do_open is a better way.

[ Make sure O_CLOEXEC is available in old systems by adding a patch
  just before this one, to keep this bisectable in such systems ]
