perf evlist: Set the correct idx when adding dummy events

The evsel->idx field is used mainly to access the right bucket in
per-event arrays such as the annotation ones, but also to set
evsel->tracking, that in turn will decide what of the events will ask
for PERF_RECORD_{MMAP,COMM,EXEC} to be generated, i.e. which
perf_event_attr will have its mmap, etc fields set.

When we were adding the "dummy" event using perf_evlist__add_dummy() we
were not setting it correctly, which could result in multiple tracking
events.

Now that I'll try using a dummy event to be the tracking one when using
'perf record --delay', i.e. when we process the --delay
setting we may already have the evlist set up, like with:

  perf record -e cycles,instructions --delay 1000 ./workload

We will need to add a "dummy" event, then reset evsel->tracking for the
first event, "cycles", and set it instead to the dummy one, and also
setting its attr.enable_on_exec, so that we get the PERF_RECORD_MMAP,
etc metadata events while waiting to enable the explicitely requested
events, so lets get this straight and set the right evsel->idx.
