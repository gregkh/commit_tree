tcmu: move expired command completion to unmap thread

This moves the expired command completion handling to
the unmap wq, so the next patch can use a mutex
in tcmu_check_expired_cmd.

Note:
tcmu_device_timedout's use of spin_lock_irq was not needed.
The commands_lock is used between thread context (tcmu_queue_cmd_ring
and tcmu_irqcontrol (even though this is named irqcontrol it is not
run in irq context)) and timer/bh context. In the timer/bh context
bhs are disabled, so you need to use the _bh lock calls from the
thread context callers.
