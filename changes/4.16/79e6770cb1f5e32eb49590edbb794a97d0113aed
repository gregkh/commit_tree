drm/i915: Remove obsolete ringbuffer emission for gen8+

Since removing the module parameter to force selection of ringbuffer
emission for gen8, the code is defunct. Remove it.

To put the difference into perspective, a couple of microbenchmarks
(bdw i7-5557u, 20170324):
                                        ring          execlists
exec continuous nops on all rings:   1.491us            2.223us
exec sequential nops on each ring:  12.508us           53.682us
single nop + sync:                   9.272us           30.291us

vblank_mode=0 glxgears:            ~11000fps           ~9000fps

Since the earlier submission, gen8 ringbuffer submission has fallen
further and further behind in features. So while ringbuffer may hold the
throughput crown, in terms of interactive latency, execlists is much
better. Alas, we have no convenient metrics for such, other than
demonstrating things we can do with execlists but can not using
legacy ringbuffer submission.

We have made a few improvements to lowlevel execlists throughput,
and ringbuffer currently panics on boot! (bdw i7-5557u, 20171026):

                                        ring          execlists
exec continuous nops on all rings:       n/a            1.921us
exec sequential nops on each ring:       n/a           44.621us
single nop + sync:                       n/a           21.953us

vblank_mode=0 glxgears:                  n/a          ~18500fps
