IB/rdmavt: Add trace for RNRNAK timer

This patch adds static trace for RNRNAK timer. Currently the output from
hrtimer static trace only shows the addresses of hrtimers in the system
and there is no easy way to correlate an RNRNAK timer with its entries in
the hrtimer trace. This patch adds the correlation among a QP, its RNRNAK
timer, and its entries in the hrtimer trace. This correlation will be
enormously helpful when debugging RNRNAK related issues. In addition, this
patch cleans up rvt_stop_rnr_timer() to be void while here.
