arm64: v8.4: Support for new floating point multiplication instructions

ARM v8.4 extensions add new neon instructions for performing a
multiplication of each FP16 element of one vector with the corresponding
FP16 element of a second vector, and to add or subtract this without an
intermediate rounding to the corresponding FP32 element in a third vector.

This patch detects this feature and let the userspace know about it via a
HWCAP bit and MRS emulation.
