hv_netvsc: common detach logic

Make common function for detaching internals of device
during changes to MTU and RSS. Make sure no more packets
are transmitted and all packets have been received before
doing device teardown.

Change the wait logic to be common and use usleep_range().

Changes transmit enabling logic so that transmit queues are disabled
during the period when lower device is being changed. And enabled
only after sub channels are setup. This avoids issue where it could
be that a packet was being sent while subchannel was not initialized.
