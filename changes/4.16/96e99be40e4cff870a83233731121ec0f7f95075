pipe: reject F_SETPIPE_SZ with size over UINT_MAX

A pipe's size is represented as an 'unsigned int'.  As expected, writing a
value greater than UINT_MAX to /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size fails with
EINVAL.  However, the F_SETPIPE_SZ fcntl silently truncates such values to
32 bits, rather than failing with EINVAL as expected.  (It *does* fail
with EINVAL for values above (1 << 31) but <= UINT_MAX.)

Fix this by moving the check against UINT_MAX into round_pipe_size() which
is called in both cases.
