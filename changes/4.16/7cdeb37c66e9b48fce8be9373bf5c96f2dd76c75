drm/edid: kerneldoc for is_hdmi2_sink

Also some breadcrumbs for how exactly to find this. Probably should
pass drm_connector * or at least drm_display_info * to that function
instead. But drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_quant_range probably also wants
drm_connector_state (and the hdmi stuff moved into that), so this is a
bit more work.

v2: Fix typo (Alex).
