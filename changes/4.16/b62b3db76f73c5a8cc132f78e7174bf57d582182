crypto: salsa20-generic - cleanup and convert to skcipher API

Convert salsa20-generic from the deprecated "blkcipher" API to the
"skcipher" API, in the process fixing it up to be thread-safe (as the
crypto API expects) by maintaining each request's state separately from
the transform context.

Also remove the unnecessary cra_alignmask and tighten validation of the
key size by accepting only 16 or 32 bytes, not anything in between.

These changes bring the code close to the way chacha20-generic does
things, so hopefully it will be easier to maintain in the future.

However, the way Salsa20 interprets the IV is still slightly different;
that was not changed.
