bcache: fix misleading error message in bch_count_io_errors()

Bcache only does recoverable I/O for read operations by calling
cached_dev_read_error(). For write opertions there is no I/O recovery for
failed requests.

But in bch_count_io_errors() no matter read or write I/Os, before errors
counter reaches io error limit, pr_err() always prints "IO error on %,
recoverying". For write requests this information is misleading, because
there is no I/O recovery at all.

This patch adds a parameter 'is_read' to bch_count_io_errors(), and only
prints "recovering" by pr_err() when the bio direction is READ.
