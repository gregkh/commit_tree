btrfs: Handle btrfs_set_extent_delalloc failure in fixup worker

This function was introduced by 247e743cbe6e ("Btrfs: Use async helpers
to deal with pages that have been improperly dirtied") and it didn't do
any error handling then. This function might very well fail in ENOMEM
situation, yet it's not handled, this could lead to inconsistent state.
So let's handle the failure by setting the mapping error bit.
