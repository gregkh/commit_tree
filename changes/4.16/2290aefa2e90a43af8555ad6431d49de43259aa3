can: dev: Add support for limiting configured bitrate

Various CAN or CAN-FD IP may be able to run at a faster rate than
what the transceiver the CAN node is connected to. This can lead to
unexpected errors. However, CAN transceivers typically have fixed
limitations and provide no means to discover these limitations at
runtime. Therefore, add support for a can-transceiver node that
can be reused by other CAN peripheral drivers to determine for both
CAN and CAN-FD what the max bitrate that can be used. If the user
tries to configure CAN to pass these maximum bitrates it will throw
an error.

Also add support for reading bitrate_max via the netlink interface.
