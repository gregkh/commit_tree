hugetlb: implement memfd sealing

Implements memfd sealing, similar to shmem:
 - WRITE: deny fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE). mmap() write is denied in
   memfd_add_seals(). write() doesn't exist for hugetlbfs.
 - SHRINK: added similar check as shmem_setattr()
 - GROW: added similar check as shmem_setattr() & shmem_fallocate()

Except write() operation that doesn't exist with hugetlbfs, that should
make sealing as close as it can be to shmem support.
