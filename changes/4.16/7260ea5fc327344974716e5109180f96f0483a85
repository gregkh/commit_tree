staging: vc04_services: Join multiline dereferences

This was found using checkpatch.pl's MULTILINE_DEREFERENCE warning.
Putting the dereference onto one line makes them easier to read,
especially when part of a larger expression (in this case, function
arguments and ternary operator), and when the dereferences are short
(as they are here).
