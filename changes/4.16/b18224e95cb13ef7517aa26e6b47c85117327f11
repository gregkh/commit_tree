drm/i915/cmdparser: Check reg_table_count before derefencing.

The find_reg function was assuming that there is always at least one table in
reg_tables. It is not always true.

In case of VCS or VECS, the reg_tables is NULL and reg_table_count is 0,
implying that no register-accessing commands are allowed. However, the command
tables include commands such as MI_STORE_REGISTER_MEM. When trying to check
such command, the find_reg would dereference NULL pointer.

Now it will just return NULL meaning that the register was not found and the
command will be rejected.
