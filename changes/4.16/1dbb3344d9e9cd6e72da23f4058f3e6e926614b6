staging: clocking-wizard: add SPDX identifier.

It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.

Fix up the staging clocking-wizard driver to have a proper SPDX
identifier, based on the license text in the file itself.  The SPDX
identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used instead of
the full boiler plate text.

This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.
