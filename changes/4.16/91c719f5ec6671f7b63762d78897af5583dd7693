soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Keep wakeup sources active during system suspend

If an R-Car SYSC slave device is part of the CPG/MSTP or CPG/MSSR Clock
Domain and to be used as a wakeup source, it must be kept active during
system suspend.

Currently this is handled in device-specific drivers by explicitly
increasing the use count of the module clock when the device is
configured as a wakeup source.  However, the proper way to prevent the
device from being stopped is to inform this requirement to the genpd
core, by setting the GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag.

Note that this will only affect devices configured as wakeup sources.
