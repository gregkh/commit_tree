USB: serial: io_edgeport: fix possible sleep-in-atomic

According to drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.c, the driver may sleep
under a spinlock.
The function call path is:
edge_bulk_in_callback (acquire the spinlock)
   process_rcvd_data
     process_rcvd_status
       change_port_settings
         send_iosp_ext_cmd
           write_cmd_usb
             usb_kill_urb --> may sleep

To fix it, the redundant usb_kill_urb() is removed from the error path
after usb_submit_urb() fails.

This possible bug is found by my static analysis tool (DSAC) and checked
by my code review.
