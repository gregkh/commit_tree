nfp: allow apps to disable ctrl vNIC capabilities

Most vNIC capabilities are netdev related.  It makes no sense
to initialize them and waste FW resources.  Some are even
counter-productive, like IRQ moderation, which will slow
down exchange of control messages.

Add to nfp_app a mask of enabled control vNIC capabilities
for apps to use.  Make flower and BPF enable all capabilities
for now.  No functional changes.
