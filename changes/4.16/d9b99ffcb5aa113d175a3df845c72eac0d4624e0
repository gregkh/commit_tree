drm/i915/cnl: Remove unnecessary check in cnl_setup_private_ppat

There is no need check if PPGTT is disabled because that not possible
in CNL. Execlists and GuC submission modes rely on at least aliasing
PPGTT and even intel_sanitize_enable_ppgtt says: "We don't allow disabling
PPGTT for gen9+ as it's a requirement for execlists, the sole mechanism
available to submit work."
