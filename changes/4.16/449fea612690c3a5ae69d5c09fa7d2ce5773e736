drm/amdkfd: Add trap handler for CWSR

The trap handler is like an interrupt handler running on the GPU
compute unit. It is needed for supporting CWSR (compute wave
save/restore).

This file defines an array with the pre-compiled GFXv8 shader ISA.
The assembly code is included for reference in #if 0 ... #endif.
