powerpc/xive: Use hw CPU ids when configuring the CPU queues

The CPU event notification queues on sPAPR should be configured using
a hardware CPU identifier.

The problem did not show up on the Power Hypervisor because pHyp
supports 8 threads per core which keeps CPU number contiguous. This is
not the case on all sPAPR virtual machines, some use SMT=1.

Also improve error logging by adding the CPU number.
