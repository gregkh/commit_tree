bpf: offload: free program id when device disappears

Bound programs are quite useless after their device disappears.
They are simply waiting for reference count to go to zero,
don't list them in BPF_PROG_GET_NEXT_ID by freeing their ID
early.

Note that orphaned offload programs will return -ENODEV on
BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD so user will never see ID 0.
