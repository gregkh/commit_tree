nfsd4: permit layoutget of executable-only files

Clients must be able to read a file in order to execute it, and for pNFS
that means the client needs to be able to perform a LAYOUTGET on the file.

This behavior for executable-only files was added for OPEN in commit
a043226bc140 "nfsd4: permit read opens of executable-only files".

This fixes up xfstests generic/126 on block/scsi layouts.
