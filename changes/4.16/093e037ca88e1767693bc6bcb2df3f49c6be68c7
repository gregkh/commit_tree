Revert "btrfs: use proper endianness accessors for super_copy"

This reverts commit 3c181c12c431fe33b669410d663beb9cceefcd1b.

The offending patch was merged in 4.16-rc4 and was promptly applied to
stable kernels 4.14.25 and 4.15.8.

The patch causes a corruption in several superblock items on big-endian
machines because of messed up endianity conversions. The damage is
manually repairable. A filesystem cannot be mounted again after it has
been unmounted once.

We do a full revert and not a fixup so stable can pick that patch ASAP.
