IB/mlx5: Create profile infrastructure to add and remove stages

Today we have single function which is used when we add an IB interface,
break this function into multiple functions.

Create stages and a generic mechanism to execute each stage.
This is in preparation for RDMA/IB representors which might not need
all stages or will do things differently in some of the stages.

This patch doesn't change any functionality.
