rtnetlink: enable IFLA_IF_NETNSID for RTM_SETLINK

- Backwards Compatibility:
  If userspace wants to determine whether RTM_SETLINK supports the
  IFLA_IF_NETNSID property they should first send an RTM_GETLINK request
  with IFLA_IF_NETNSID on lo. If either EACCESS is returned or the reply
  does not include IFLA_IF_NETNSID userspace should assume that
  IFLA_IF_NETNSID is not supported on this kernel.
  If the reply does contain an IFLA_IF_NETNSID property userspace
  can send an RTM_SETLINK with a IFLA_IF_NETNSID property. If they receive
  EOPNOTSUPP then the kernel does not support the IFLA_IF_NETNSID property
  with RTM_SETLINK. Userpace should then fallback to other means.

  To retain backwards compatibility the kernel will first check whether a
  IFLA_NET_NS_PID or IFLA_NET_NS_FD property has been passed. If either
  one is found it will be used to identify the target network namespace.
  This implies that users who do not care whether their running kernel
  supports IFLA_IF_NETNSID with RTM_SETLINK can pass both
  IFLA_NET_NS_{FD,PID} and IFLA_IF_NETNSID referring to the same network
  namespace.

- Security:
  Callers must have CAP_NET_ADMIN in the owning user namespace of the
  target network namespace.
