ASoC: TSCS42xx: make functions pll_event and dac_event static

The functions pll_event and dac_event are local to the source and do
not need to be in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'pll_event' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'dac_event' was not declared. Should it be static?
