media: staging/imx: update TODO

Update TODO file:

- Remove TODO info about the OV564x driver, while this still needs
  to be done (add a OV5642 driver or merge with OV5640 driver), it
  is not relevant here.

- Update TODO about methods for retrieving CSI bus config.

- Add some TODO's about OF graph parsing restrictions.
