pinctrl: intel: ensure error return ret is initialized

In the (unlikely) event that community->ngpps is zero, or if every
gpp->gpio_base is less than zero, then an ininitialized value in
ret is returned by function intel_gpio_add_pin_ranges. Fix this by
ensuring ret is initialized to zero.  It's a moot point, but I think
it is worthwhile ensuring this corner case is fixed.
