i2c: algo-bit: init the bus to a known state

Ensure the bus is free when we register the adapter. Before the SCL/SDA
wires were in an unknown state. It used to work because sending a byte
has a retry mechanism which was triggered if the bus was initially in a
non-free state. But the graceful way to do it is to initialize
correctly.
