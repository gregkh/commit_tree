dm raid: consume sizes after md_finish_reshape() completes changing them

The md raid personalities call md_finish_reshape() at the end of a
reshape conversion which adjusts rdev->sectors.

Correct/check rdev->sectors before initiating a reshape and raise the
recovery pointer accordingly.

Otherwise, the DM raid coordinated reshape will fail.
