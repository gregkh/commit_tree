KVM: x86: Optimization: Create SVM stubs for sync_pir_to_irr()

sync_pir_to_irr() is only called if vcpu->arch.apicv_active()==true.
In case it is false, VMX code make sure to set sync_pir_to_irr
to NULL.

Therefore, having SVM stubs allows to remove check for if
sync_pir_to_irr != NULL from all calling sites.
