pinctrl: rockchip: enable clock when reading pin direction register

We generally leave the GPIO clock disabled, unless an interrupt is
requested or we're accessing IO registers. We forgot to do this for the
->get_direction() callback, which means we can sometimes [1] get
incorrect results [2] from, e.g., /sys/kernel/debug/gpio.

Enable the clock, so we get the right results!

[1] Sometimes, because many systems have 1 or mor interrupt requested on
each GPIO bank, so they always leave their clock on.

[2] Incorrect, meaning the register returns 0, and so we interpret that
as "input".
