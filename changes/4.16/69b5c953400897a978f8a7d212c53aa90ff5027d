perf test shell: Fix check open filename arg using 'perf trace'

Commit f231af789b11 ("perf test shell: Fix check open filename arg using
'perf trace' on s390x") added an exception for s390x to use openat()
instead of open() in the test that intercepts a open syscall to look for
the filename argument as obtained by the vfs_getname 'perf probe' it
puts in place at the getname_flags kernel function.

Its not just s390x that uses openat() instead of open(), so use 'perf
list' to look for the syscall:sys_enter_open(at)? present in the system
being tested instead of checking if the system is s390x.

In fact Namhyung pointed out that glibc 2.26 changed this behaviour, as
described in https://lwn.net/Articles/738694/, so systems where glibc is
>= 2.26 will need this patch for this test to work, which already took
place in some distros for architectures such as s390x, while Fedora 26
x86_64 is at glibc 2.25, i.e. still uses open().
