xprtrdma: Replace all usage of "frmr" with "frwr"

Clean up: Over time, the industry has adopted the term "frwr"
instead of "frmr". The term "frwr" is now more widely recognized.

For the past couple of years I've attempted to add new code using
"frwr" , but there still remains plenty of older code that still
uses "frmr". Replace all usage of "frmr" to avoid confusion.

While we're churning code, rename variables unhelpfully called "f"
to "frwr", to improve code clarity.
