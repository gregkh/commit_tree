xfs: fix up agi unlinked list reservations

The current AGI unlinked list addition and removal reservations do
not reflect the worst case log usage. An unlinked list removal can
log up to two on-disk inode clusters but only includes reservation
for one. An unlinked list addition logs the on-disk cluster but
includes reservation for an in-core inode.

Update the AGI unlinked list reservation helpers to calculate the
correct worst case reservation for the associated operations.
