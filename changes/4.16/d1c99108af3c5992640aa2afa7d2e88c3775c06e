Revert "x86/retpoline: Simplify vmexit_fill_RSB()"

This reverts commit 1dde7415e99933bb7293d6b2843752cbdb43ec11. By putting
the RSB filling out of line and calling it, we waste one RSB slot for
returning from the function itself, which means one fewer actual function
call we can make if we're doing the Skylake abomination of call-depth
counting.

It also changed the number of RSB stuffings we do on vmexit from 32,
which was correct, to 16. Let's just stop with the bikeshedding; it
didn't actually *fix* anything anyway.
