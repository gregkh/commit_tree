vrf: check forwarding on the original netdevice when generating ICMP dest unreachable

When ip_error() is called the device is the l3mdev master instead of the
original device. So the forwarding check should be on the original one.

Changes from v2:
- Handle the original device disappearing (per David Ahern)
- Minimize the change in code order

Changes from v1:
- Only need to reset the device on which __in_dev_get_rcu() is done (per
  David Ahern).
