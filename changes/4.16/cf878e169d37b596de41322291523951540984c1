x86/jailhouse: Wire up IOAPIC for legacy UART ports

The typical I/O interrupts in non-root cells are MSI-based. However, the
platform UARTs do not support MSI. In order to run a non-root cell that
shall use one of them, the standard IOAPIC must be registered and 1:1
routing for IRQ 3 and 4 set up.

If an IOAPIC is not available, the boot loader clears standard_ioapic in
the setup data, so registration is skipped. If the guest is not allowed to
to use one of those pins, Jailhouse will simply ignore the access.
