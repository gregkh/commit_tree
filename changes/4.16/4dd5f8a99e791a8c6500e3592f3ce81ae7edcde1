powerpc/mm/radix: Split linear mapping on hot-unplug

This patch splits the linear mapping if the hot-unplug range is
smaller than the mapping size. The code detects if the mapping needs
to be split into a smaller size and if so, uses the stop machine
infrastructure to clear the existing mapping and then remap the
remaining range using a smaller page size.

The code will skip any region of the mapping that overlaps with kernel
text and warn about it once. We don't want to remove a mapping where
the kernel text and the LMB we intend to remove overlap in the same
TLB mapping as it may affect the currently executing code.

I've tested these changes under a kvm guest with 2 vcpus, from a split
mapping point of view, some of the caveats mentioned above applied to
the testing I did.
