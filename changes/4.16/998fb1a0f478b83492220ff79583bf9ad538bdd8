drm: gem_cma_helper.c: Allow importing of contiguous scatterlists with nents > 1

drm_gem_cma_prime_import_sg_table() will fail if the number of entries
in the sg_table > 1. However, you can have a device that uses an IOMMU
engine and can map a discontiguous buffer with multiple entries that
have consecutive sg_dma_addresses, effectively making it contiguous.
Allow for that scenario by testing the entries in the sg_table for
contiguous coverage.
