f2fs: handle newly created page when revoking inmem pages

When committing inmem pages is successful, we revoke already committed
blocks in __revoke_inmem_pages() and finally replace the committed
ones with the old blocks using f2fs_replace_block(). However, if
the committed block was newly created one, the address of the old
block is NEW_ADDR and __f2fs_replace_block() cannot handle NEW_ADDR
as new_blkaddr properly and a kernel panic occurrs.
