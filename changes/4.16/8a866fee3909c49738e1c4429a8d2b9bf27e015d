kfifo: DECLARE_KIFO_PTR(fifo, u64) does not work on arm 32 bit

If you try to store u64 in a kfifo (or a struct with u64 members),
then the buf member of __STRUCT_KFIFO_PTR will cause 4 bytes
padding due to alignment (note that struct __kfifo is 20 bytes
on 32 bit).

That in turn causes the __is_kfifo_ptr() to fail, which is caught
by kfifo_alloc(), which now returns EINVAL.

So, ensure that __is_kfifo_ptr() compares to the right structure.
