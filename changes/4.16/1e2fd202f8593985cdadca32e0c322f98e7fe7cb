ntb_hw_switchtec: Check for alignment of the buffer in mw_set_trans()

With Switchtec hardware, the buffer used for a memory window must be
aligned to its size (the hardware only replaces the lower bits). In
certain circumstances dma_alloc_coherent() will not provide a buffer
that adheres to this requirement like when using the CMA and
CONFIG_CMA_ALIGNMENT is set lower than the buffer size.

When we get an unaligned buffer mw_set_trans() should return an error.
We also log an error so we know the cause of the problem.
