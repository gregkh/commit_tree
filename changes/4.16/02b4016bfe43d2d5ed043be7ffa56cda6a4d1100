i40e: program fragmented IPv4 filter input set

When implementing support for IP_USER_FLOW filters, we correctly
programmed a filter for both the non fragmented IPv4/Other filter, as
well as the fragmented IPv4 filters. However, we did not properly
program the input set for fragmented IPv4 PCTYPE. This meant that the
filters would almost certainly not match, unless the user specified all
of the flow types.

Add support to program the fragmented IPv4 filter input set. Since we
always program these filters together, we'll assume that the two input
sets must match, and will thus always program the input sets to the same
value.
