cxgb4vf: Fix SGE FL buffer initialization logic for 64K pages

We'd come in with SGE_FL_BUFFER_SIZE[0] and [1] both equal to 64KB and
the extant logic would flag that as an error. This was already fixed in
cxgb4 driver with "92ddcc7 cxgb4: Fix some small bugs in
t4_sge_init_soft() when our Page Size is 64KB".
