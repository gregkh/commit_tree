HID: roccat: prevent an out of bounds read in kovaplus_profile_activated()

We get the "new_profile_index" value from the mouse device when we're
handling raw events.  Smatch taints it as untrusted data and complains
that we need a bounds check.  This seems like a reasonable warning
otherwise there is a small read beyond the end of the array.
