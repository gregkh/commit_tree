Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Invalidate IRQ on request failure

If devm_request_irq() fails, the driver bails out of bcm_request_irq()
but continues to ->setup the device (because the IRQ is optional).

The driver subsequently calls devm_free_irq(), enable_irq_wake() and
disable_irq_wake() on the IRQ even though requesting it failed.

Avoid by invalidating the IRQ on request failure.
