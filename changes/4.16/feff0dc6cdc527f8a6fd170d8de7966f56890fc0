drm/i915/pmu: Suspend sampling when GPU is idle

If only a subset of events is enabled we can afford to suspend
the sampling timer when the GPU is idle and so save some cycles
and power.

v2: Rebase and limit timer even more.
v3: Rebase.
v4: Rebase.
v5: Skip action if perf PMU failed to register.
v6: Checkpatch cleanup.
v7:
 * Add a common helper to start the timer if needed. (Chris Wilson)
 * Add comment explaining bitwise logic in pmu_needs_timer.
v8: Fix some comments styles. (Chris Wilson)
v9: Rebase.
v10: Move function declarations to i915_pmu.h.
v11: Rename functions to i915_pmu_gt_(un)parked. (Chris Wilson)
