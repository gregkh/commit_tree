xfrm: Fix policy hold queue after flowcache removal.

Now that the flowcache is removed we need to generate
a new dummy bundle every time we check if the needed
SAs are in place because the dummy bundle is not cached
anymore. Fix it by passing the XFRM_LOOKUP_QUEUE flag
to xfrm_lookup(). This makes sure that we get a dummy
bundle in case the SAs are not yet in place.
