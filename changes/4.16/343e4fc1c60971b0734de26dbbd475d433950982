Btrfs: set plug for fsync

Setting plug can merge adjacent IOs before dispatching IOs to the disk
driver.

Without plug, it'd not be a problem for single disk usecases, but for
multiple disks using raid profile, a large IO can be split to several
IOs of stripe length, and plug can be helpful to bring them together
for each disk so that we can save several disk access.

Moreover, fsync issues synchronous writes, so plug can really take
effect.
