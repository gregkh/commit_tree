usb: xhci: Add DbC support in xHCI driver

xHCI compatible USB host controllers(i.e. super-speed USB3 controllers)
can be implemented with the Debug Capability(DbC). It presents a debug
device which is fully compliant with the USB framework and provides the
equivalent of a very high performance full-duplex serial link. The debug
capability operation model and registers interface are defined in 7.6.8
of the xHCI specification, revision 1.1.

The DbC debug device shares a root port with the xHCI host. By default,
the debug capability is disabled and the root port is assigned to xHCI.
When the DbC is enabled, the root port will be assigned to the DbC debug
device, and the xHCI sees nothing on this port. This implementation uses
a sysfs node named <dbc> under the xHCI device to manage the enabling
and disabling of the debug capability.

When the debug capability is enabled, it will present a debug device
through the debug port. This debug device is fully compliant with the
USB3 framework, and it can be enumerated by a debug host on the other
end of the USB link. As soon as the debug device is configured, a TTY
serial device named /dev/ttyDBC0 will be created.
