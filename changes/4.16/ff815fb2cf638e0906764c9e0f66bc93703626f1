ixgbe: There is no need to update num_rx_pools in L2 fwd offload

The num_rx_pools value is overwritten when we reinitialize the queue
configuration. In reality we shouldn't need to be updating the value since
it is redone every time we call into ixgbe_setup_tc so for now just drop
the spots where we were incrementing or decrementing the value.
