ima: relax requiring a file signature for new files with zero length

Custom policies can require file signatures based on LSM labels.  These
files are normally created and only afterwards labeled, requiring them
to be signed.

Instead of requiring file signatures based on LSM labels, entire
filesystems could require file signatures.  In this case, we need the
ability of writing new files without requiring file signatures.

The definition of a "new" file was originally defined as any file with
a length of zero.  Subsequent patches redefined a "new" file to be based
on the FILE_CREATE open flag.  By combining the open flag with a file
size of zero, this patch relaxes the file signature requirement.
