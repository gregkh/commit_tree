bcache: correct flash only vols (check all uuids)

Commit 2831231d4c3f ("bcache: reduce cache_set devices iteration by
devices_max_used") adds c->devices_max_used to reduce iteration of
c->uuids elements, this value is updated in bcache_device_attach().

But for flash only volume, when calling flash_devs_run(), the function
bcache_device_attach() is not called yet and c->devices_max_used is not
updated. The unexpected result is, the flash only volume won't be run
by flash_devs_run().

This patch fixes the issue by iterate all c->uuids elements in
flash_devs_run(). c->devices_max_used will be updated properly when
bcache_device_attach() gets called.
