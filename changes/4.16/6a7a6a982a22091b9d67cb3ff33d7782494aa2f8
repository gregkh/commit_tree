drm/i915: Add a policy note for removing workarounds

Rodrigo gave a persuasive argument for keeping workarounds: that they
serve as a good guide for the bring up of the next generation. Not only
do workarounds persist into the early revisions, they show where the
workarounds were previously added to the code flow and sometimes the old
workarounds have an explanation that give insight into their wider
implications.

Based on his suggestion, document the policy that we want to keep the
workarounds from the current generation to guide the next. Older
preproduction workarounds we still want to remove to keep the code
clean.
