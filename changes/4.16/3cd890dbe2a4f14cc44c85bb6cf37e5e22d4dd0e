media: dvb-frontends: fix i2c access helpers for KASAN

A typical code fragment was copied across many dvb-frontend drivers and
causes large stack frames when built with with CONFIG_KASAN on gcc-5/6/7:

drivers/media/dvb-frontends/cxd2841er.c:3225:1: error: the frame size of 3992 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
drivers/media/dvb-frontends/cxd2841er.c:3404:1: error: the frame size of 3136 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv0367.c:3143:1: error: the frame size of 4016 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv090x.c:3430:1: error: the frame size of 5312 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv090x.c:4248:1: error: the frame size of 4872 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

gcc-8 now solves this by consolidating the stack slots for the argument
variables, but on older compilers we can get the same behavior by taking
the pointer of a local variable rather than the inline function argument.
