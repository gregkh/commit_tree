drm/i915: Bump wait-times for the final CS interrupt before parking

In the idle worker we drop the prolonged GT wakeref used to cover such
essentials as interrupt delivery. (When a CS interrupt arrives, we also
assert that the GT is awake.) However, it turns out that 10ms is not
long enough to be assured that the last CS interrupt has been delivered,
so bump that to 200ms, and move the entirety of that wait to before we
take the struct_mutex to avoid blocking. As this is now a potentially
long wait, restore the earlier behaviour of bailing out early when a new
request arrives.

v2: Break out the repeated check for new requests into its own little
helper to try and improve the self-commentary.
