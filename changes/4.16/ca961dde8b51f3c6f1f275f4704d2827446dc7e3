arm: vt8500: kconfig: Remove blank help text

Blank help texts are probably either a typo, a Kconfig misunderstanding,
or some kind of half-committing to adding a help text (in which case a
TODO comment would be clearer, if the help text really can't be added
right away).

Best to remove them, IMO.
