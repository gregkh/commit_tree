powerpc/numa: Update numa code use walk_drmem_lmbs

Update code in powerpc/numa.c to use the walk_drmem_lmbs()
routine instead of parsing the device tree directly. This is
in anticipation of introducing a new ibm,dynamic-memory-v2
property with a different format. This will allow the numa code
to use a single initialization routine per-LMB irregardless of
the device tree format.

Additionally, to support additional routines in numa.c that need
to look up LMB information, an late_init routine is added to drmem.c
to allocate the array of LMB information. This LMB array will provide
per-LMB information to separate the LMB data from the device tree
format.
