RDMA/bnxt_re: Add support for query firmware version

The device now reports firmware version thus, removing
the hard coded values of the FW version string and
redundant fw_rev hook from sysfs. Adding code to query
firmware version from underlying device and report it
through the kernel verb to get firmware version string.
