pinctrl: mcp23s08: Improve unlocking of a mutex in mcp23s08_irq()

* Add a jump target so that a call of the function "mutex_unlock" is stored
  only twice in this function implementation.

* Replace five calls by goto statements.

* Adjust five condition checks.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
