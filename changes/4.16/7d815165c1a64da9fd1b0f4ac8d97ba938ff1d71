eventfd: convert to use anon_inode_getfd()

Nothing actually calls eventfd_file_create() besides the eventfd2()
system call itself.  So simplify things by folding it into the system
call and using anon_inode_getfd() instead of anon_inode_getfile().  This
removes over 40 lines with no change in functionality.

(eventfd_file_create() was apparently added years ago for KVM irqfd's,
but was never used.)
