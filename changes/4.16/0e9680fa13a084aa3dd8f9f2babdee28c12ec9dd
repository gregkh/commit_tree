scsi: bfa: replace bfa_get_log_time() with ktime_get_real_seconds()

The bfa_get_log_time() returns a 64-bit timestamp that does not suffer
from the y2038 overflow on 64-bit systems. However, on 32-bit
architectures the timestamp will jump from 0x000000007fffffff to
0xffffffff80000000 in y2038 and produce wrong results.

The ktime_get_real_seconds() function does the same thing as
bfa_get_log_time() without that problem, so we can simply remove the
former use ktime_get_real_seconds() instead.
