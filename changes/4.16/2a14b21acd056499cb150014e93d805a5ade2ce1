MIPS: math-emu: Mark fall throughs in switch statements with a comment

Mark intentional fall throughs in switch statements with a consistent
comment.

In most of the cases, a new comment line containing text "fall through"
is inserted. In some of the cases, existing comment contained a variation
of the text "fall through" (for example, "FALL THROUGH" or "drop through").
In such cases, the existing comment is modified to contain "fall through".
Lastly, in two cases, code segments were described in comments as "fall
througs", but were in reality "breaks out" of switch statement. In such
cases, existing comments are accordingly modified.

Apart from making code easier to follow and debug, this change enables
some static code analysers to interpret newly inserted comments as their
annotations (and, therefore, not issue warnings of type "fall through in
switch statement", which is desireable, since marked fallthroughs are
intentional).
