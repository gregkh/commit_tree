nfp: fix fw dump handling of absolute rtsym size

Fix bug that causes _absolute_ rtsym sizes of > 8 bytes (as per symbol
table) to result in incorrect space used during a TLV-based debug dump.

Detail: The size calculation stage calculates the correct size (size of
the rtsym address field == 8), while the dump uses the size in the table
to calculate the TLV size to reserve. Symbols with size <= 8 are handled
OK due to aligning sizes to 8, but including any absolute symbol with
listed size > 8 leads to an ENOSPC error during the dump.
