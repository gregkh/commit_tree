drm/i915: Pass around crtc and connector states for audio

Explicitly pass the crtc and connector states into the audio
code enable/disable hooks, and plumb them all the way down.

This gets rid of almost all crtc->config and encoder->crtc
uses. The one place where we still use them is
i915_audio_component_sync_audio_rate() since that gets called from
the audio driver and we don't have explicit states around then.
