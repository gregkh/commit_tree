ARM: dts: armadillo800eva: Convert to named i2c-gpio bindings

Commits 7d29f509d2cfd807 ("dt-bindings: i2c: i2c-gpio: Add support for
named gpios") and 05c74778858d7d99 ("i2c: gpio: Add support for named
gpios in DT") introduced named i2c-gpio DT bindings, and deprecated the
more error-prone unnamed variant.

Switch to the new bindings, and add the missing GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN I/O
flags, which were implicitly assumed before.

The latter gets rid of the message:

    gpio-208 (?): enforced open drain please flag it properly in DT/ACPI DSDT/board file
    gpio-91 (?): enforced open drain please flag it properly in DT/ACPI DSDT/board file
