nvme-pci: clean up CMB initialization

Refactor the call to nvme_map_cmb, and change the conditions for probing
for the CMB.  First remove the version check as NVMe TPs always apply
to earlier versions of the spec as well.  Second check for the whole CMBSZ
register for support of the CMB feature instead of just the size field
inside of it to simplify the code a bit.
