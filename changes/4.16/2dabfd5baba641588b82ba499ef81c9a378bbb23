CIFS: SMBD: Add parameter rdata to smb2_new_read_req

This patch is for preparing upper layer for doing SMB read via RDMA write.

When we assemble the SMB read packet header, we need to know the I/O layout
if this request is to use a RDMA write. rdata has all the information we need
for memory registration. Add rdata to smb2_new_read_req.
