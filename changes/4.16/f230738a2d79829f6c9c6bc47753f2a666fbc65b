ARM: dts: imx51-ts4800: Fix syscon and touschscreen nodes

The syscon node has an incorrect notation for its unit address and the
wdt node has an unneeded unit address.

Fix them so that the following build warnings with W=1 are gone:

arch/arm/boot/dts/imx51-ts4800.dtb: Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /soc/aips@80000000/weim@83fda000/fpga@0/syscon@b0010000/wdt@e has a unit name, but no reg property
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx51-ts4800.dtb: Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /soc/aips@80000000/weim@83fda000/fpga@0/touchscreen has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx51-ts4800.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/aips@80000000/weim@83fda000/fpga@0/syscon@b0010000 simple-bus unit address format error, expected "10000"
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx51-ts4800.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/aips@80000000/weim@83fda000/fpga@0/touchscreen simple-bus unit address format error, expected "12000"
