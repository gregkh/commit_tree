drm/i915: Introduce GEM proxy

GEM proxy is a kind of GEM, whose backing physical memory is pinned
and produced by guest VM and is used by host as read only. With GEM
proxy, host is able to access guest physical memory through GEM object
interface. As GEM proxy is such a special kind of GEM, a new flag
I915_GEM_OBJECT_IS_PROXY is introduced to ban host from changing the
backing storage of GEM proxy.
