arm_pmu: note IRQs and PMUs per-cpu

To support ACPI systems, we need to request IRQs before we know the
associated PMU, and thus we need some percpu variable that the IRQ
handler can find the PMU from.

As we're going to request IRQs without the PMU, we can't rely on the
arm_pmu::active_irqs mask, and similarly need to track requested IRQs
with a percpu variable.
