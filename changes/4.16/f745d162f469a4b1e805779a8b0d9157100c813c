HID: core: move the list of ignored devices in hid-quirks.c

Better having all the devices quirks in one place.

Note that this change introduces an initial lookup for the device in
hid_gets_squirk(), which should not theoretically be required, but which
actually allows to not have to reparse the list of ignored devices
if we call hid_lookup_quirks twice.
