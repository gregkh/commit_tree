HID: quirks: move the list of special devices into a quirk

It is better to centralize the information of special devices in one
single file. Instead of manually parsing the list of devices that
have a special driver or those that need to be ignored, introduce
HID_QUIRK_HAVE_SPECIAL_DRIVER and set the correct quirks while fetching
those quirks.
