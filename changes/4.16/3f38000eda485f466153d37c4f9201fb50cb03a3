powerpc/firmware: Add definitions for new drc-info firmware feature

Firmware Features: Define new bit flag representing the presence of
new device tree property "ibm,drc-info".  The flag is used to tell
the front end processor whether the Linux kernel supports the new
property, and by the front end processor to tell the Linux kernel
that the new property is present in the device tree.
