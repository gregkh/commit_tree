IB/core: Increase number of char device minors

There is a need to increase number of possible char devices to support
large number of SR-IOV instances. The current limit is in the range of
64-128 devices/ports. Increase it to support up to 1024.

The patch performs the following steps to refactor the code:
1. Removes the split bitmap for fixed and overflow dev numbers.
2. Pre-allocates the non-legacy major number range during driver
   initialization, choosen for simplicity.
3. Add new define (RDMA_MAX_PORTS) that is shared between all drivers.
   This is the maximum total number of ports on all struct ib_devices.
4. Set RDMA_MAX_PORTS to 1024.
