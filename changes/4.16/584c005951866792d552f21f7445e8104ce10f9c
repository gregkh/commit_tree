tracing, rcu: Remove no longer used trace event rcu_prep_idle

Commit c0f4dfd4f90 ("rcu: Make RCU_FAST_NO_HZ take advantage of
numbered callbacks") removed the only instances of trace_rcu_prep_idle,
but did not remove the TRACE_EVENT() that creates it. As defined trace
events take up memory within the kernel even when they are not used,
this is a waste of space. Remove the obsolete event.
