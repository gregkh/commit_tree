x86/entry/64: Remove the SYSCALL64 fast path

The SYCALLL64 fast path was a nice, if small, optimization back in the good
old days when syscalls were actually reasonably fast.  Now there is PTI to
slow everything down, and indirect branches are verboten, making everything
messier.  The retpoline code in the fast path is particularly nasty.

Just get rid of the fast path. The slow path is barely slower.
