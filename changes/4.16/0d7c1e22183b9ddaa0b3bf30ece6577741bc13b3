x86/jailhouse: Avoid access of unsupported platform resources

Non-root cells do not have CMOS access, thus the warm reset cannot be
enabled. There is no RTC, thus also no wall clock. Furthermore, there
are no ISA IRQs and no PIC.

Also disable probing of i8042 devices that are typically blocked for
non-root cells. In theory, access could also be granted to a non-root
cell, provided the root cell is not using the devices. But there is no
concrete scenario in sight, and disabling probing over Jailhouse allows
to build generic kernels that keep CONFIG_SERIO enabled for use in
normal systems.
