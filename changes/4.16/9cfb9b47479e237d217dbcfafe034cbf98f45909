xfs: provide a centralized method for verifying inline fork data

Replace the current haphazard dir2 shortform verifier callsites with a
centralized verifier function that can be called either with the default
verifier functions or with a custom set.  This helps us strengthen
integrity checking while providing us with flexibility for repair tools.

xfs_repair wants this to be able to supply its own verifier functions
when trying to fix possibly corrupt metadata.
