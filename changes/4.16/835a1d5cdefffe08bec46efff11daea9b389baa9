Revert "arm64: dts: rockchip: add usb3-phy otg-port support for rk3399"

This reverts commit c301b327aea898af558b2387252a2f5fc0117dee.

While this works splendidly on rk3399-gru devices using the cros-ec
extcon, other rk3399-based devices using the fusb302 or no power-delivery
controller at all don't probe at all anymore, as the typec-phy currently
always expects the extcon to be available and therefore defers probing
indefinitly on these.
