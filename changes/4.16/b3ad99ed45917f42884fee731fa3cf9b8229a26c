drm/i915/cmdparser: Do not check past the cmd length.

The command MEDIA_VFE_STATE checks bits at offset +2 dwords. However, it is
possible to have MEDIA_VFE_STATE command with length = 0 + LENGTH_BIAS = 2.
In that case check_cmd will read bits from the following command, or even past
the end of the buffer.

If the offset ends up outside of the command length, reject the command.
