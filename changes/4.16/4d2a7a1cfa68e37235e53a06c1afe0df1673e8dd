qtnfmac: modify GET_STA_STATS cmd format for back/forward compatibility

A set of per-STA statistics can potentially change quite often.
To ensure backwards and forward compatibility,
modify GET_STA_STATS command format:
  - introduce two TLV types
  - first TLV is a variable-sized bitmap of statistics values
    that are filled by firmware
  - second TLV is a structure with statistics itself

Only values specified in first TLV are valid.
