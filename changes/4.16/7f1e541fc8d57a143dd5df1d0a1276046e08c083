compiler.h: Add read_word_at_a_time() function.

Sometimes we know that it's safe to do potentially out-of-bounds access
because we know it won't cross a page boundary.  Still, KASAN will
report this as a bug.

Add read_word_at_a_time() function which is supposed to be used in such
cases.  In read_word_at_a_time() KASAN performs relaxed check - only the
first byte of access is validated.
