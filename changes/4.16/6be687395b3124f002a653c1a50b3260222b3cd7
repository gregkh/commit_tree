s390/qeth: free netdevice when removing a card

On removal, a qeth card's netdevice is currently not properly freed
because the call chain looks as follows:

qeth_core_remove_device(card)
	lx_remove_device(card)
		unregister_netdev(card->dev)
		card->dev = NULL			!!!
	qeth_core_free_card(card)
		if (card->dev)				!!!
			free_netdev(card->dev)

Fix it by free'ing the netdev straight after unregistering. This also
fixes the sysfs-driven layer switch case (qeth_dev_layer2_store()),
where the need to free the current netdevice was not considered at all.

Note that free_netdev() takes care of the netif_napi_del() for us too.
