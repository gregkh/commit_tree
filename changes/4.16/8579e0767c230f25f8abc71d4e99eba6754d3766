crypto: chelsio - make arrays sgl_ent_len and dsgl_ent_len static

The arrays sgl_ent_len and dsgl_ent_len are local to the source and do
not need to be in global scope, so make them static. Also re-format the
declarations to match the following round_constant array declaration
style.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
drivers/crypto/chelsio/chcr_algo.c:76:14: warning: symbol 'sgl_ent_len'
was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/crypto/chelsio/chcr_algo.c:81:14: warning: symbol 'dsgl_ent_len'
was not declared. Should it be static?
