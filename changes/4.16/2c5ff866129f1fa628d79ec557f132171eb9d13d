media: atomisp: deprecate pci_get_bus_and_slot()

pci_get_bus_and_slot() is restrictive such that it assumes domain=0 as
where a PCI device is present. This restricts the device drivers to be
reused for other domain numbers.

Getting ready to remove pci_get_bus_and_slot() function. Since ISP always
uses domain 0, hard-code it in the code when calling the replacement
function pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot().
