hotplug/drc-info: Add code to search ibm,drc-info property

rpadlpar_core.c: Provide parallel routines to search the older device-
tree properties ("ibm,drc-indexes", "ibm,drc-names", "ibm,drc-types"
and "ibm,drc-power-domains"), or the new property "ibm,drc-info".

The interface to examine the DRC information is changed from a "get"
function that returns values for local verification elsewhere, to a
"check" function that validates the 'name' and/or 'type' of a device
node.  This update hides the format of the underlying device-tree
properties, and concentrates the value checks into a single function
without requiring the user to verify whether a search was successful.
