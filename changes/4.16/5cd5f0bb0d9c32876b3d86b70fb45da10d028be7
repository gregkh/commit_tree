i2c: ismt: 16-byte align the DMA buffer address

Use only a portion of the data buffer for DMA transfers, which is always
16-byte aligned. This makes the DMA buffer address 16-byte aligned and
compensates for spurious hardware parity errors that may appear when the
DMA buffer address is not 16-byte aligned.

The data buffer is enlarged in order to accommodate any possible 16-byte
alignment offset and changes the DMA code to only use a portion of the
data buffer, which is 16-byte aligned.

The symptom of the hardware issue is the same as the one addressed in
v3.12-rc2-5-gbf41691 and manifests by transfers failing with EIO, with
bit 9 being set in the ERRSTS register.
