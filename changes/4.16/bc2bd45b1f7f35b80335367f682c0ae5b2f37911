ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Parse nhlt and register clock device

When NHLT endpoint is present for a SSP then we create clock for that SSP.

MCLK is consistent across endpoints and configuration for an SSP, so query
only for first endpoint for an SSP.

For SCLK/SCLKFS, the best fit is queried from the NHLT configurations which
matches the clock rate requested. Best fit is decided based on below:

1. If rate matches with multiple configurations, then the first
   configuration is selected.

2. If for a selected fs and bits_per_sample, there are multiple endpoint
   configuration match, then the configuration with max number of
   channels is selected. So, the user has to set the rate which fits
   max number of channels

So we create a platform device and pass clock information parsed as
platform data.
