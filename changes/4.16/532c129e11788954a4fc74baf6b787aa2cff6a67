ARM: dts: sun8i: fix USB Ethernet of Orange Pi R1

Orange Pi R1 uses a Realtek RTL8152B USB Ethernet chip, which is easily
seen on the board but not show in the schematics. A regulator for the
power of the RTL8152B chip is hidden, which uses the same pin with the
Wi-Fi regulator on the original Orange Pi Zero.

Add this regulator back to the device tree, and bind it to USB1.
