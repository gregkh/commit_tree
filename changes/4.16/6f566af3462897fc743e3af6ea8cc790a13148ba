Revert "typec: tcpm: Only request matching pdos"

Commit 57e6f0d7b804 ("typec: tcpm: Only request matching pdos") is causing
a regression, before this commit e.g. the GPD win and GPD pocket devices
were charging at 9V 3A with a PD charger, now they are instead slowly
discharging  at 5V 0.4A, as this commit causes the ports max_snk_mv/ma/mw
settings to be completely ignored.

Arguably the way to fix this would be to add a PDO_VAR() describing the
voltage range to the snk_caps of boards which can handle any voltage in
their range, but the "typec: tcpm: Only request matching pdos" commit
looks at the type of PDO advertised by the source/charger and if that
is fixed (as it typically is) only compairs against PDO_FIXED entries
in the snk_caps so supporting a range of voltage would require adding a
PDO_FIXED entry for *every possible* voltage to snk_caps.

AFAICT there is no reason why a fixed source_cap cannot be matched against
a variable snk_cap, so at a minimum the commit should be rewritten to
support that.

For now lets revert the "typec: tcpm: Only request matching pdos" commit,
fixing the regression.
