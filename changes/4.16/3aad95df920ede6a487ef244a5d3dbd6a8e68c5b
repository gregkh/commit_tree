mlxsw: spectrum_router: Pass FIB node to LPM tree unlink function

Next patch will try to optimize the LPM tree and make sure only used
prefix lengths are present, to avoid unnecessary look-ups.

Pass the currently removed FIB node to the unlinking function as its
associated prefix length is a potential candidate for removal from the
tree.
