btrfs: factor btrfs_check_rw_degradable() to check given device

Update btrfs_check_rw_degradable() to check against the given device if
its lost.

We can use this function to know if the volume is going to be in
degraded mode OR failed state, when the given device fails.  Which is
needed when we are handling the device failed state.

A preparatory patch does not affect the flow as such.
