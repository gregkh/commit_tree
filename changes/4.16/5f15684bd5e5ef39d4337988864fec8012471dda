partitions/msdos: Unable to mount UFS 44bsd partitions

UFS partitions from newer versions of FreeBSD 10 and 11 use relative
addressing for their subpartitions. But older versions of FreeBSD still
use absolute addressing just like OpenBSD and NetBSD.

Instead of simply testing for a FreeBSD partition, the code needs to
also test if the starting offset of the C subpartition is zero.
