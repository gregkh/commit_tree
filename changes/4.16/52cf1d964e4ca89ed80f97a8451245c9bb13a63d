media: vimc: add test_pattern and h/vflip controls to the sensor

Add support for the test_pattern control and the h/vflip controls.

This makes it possible to switch to more interesting test patterns and to
test control handling in v4l-subdevs.

There are more tpg-related controls that can be added, but this is a good
start.
