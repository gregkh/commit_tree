nfp: flower: do not assume mac/mpls matches

Remove the matching of mac/mpls as a default selection. These are not
necessarily set by a TC rule (unlike the port). Previously a mac/mpls
field would exist in every match and be masked out if not used. This patch
has no impact on functionality but removes unnessary memory assignment in
the match cmsg.
