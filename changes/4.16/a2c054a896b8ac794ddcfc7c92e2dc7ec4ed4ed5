net: phy: Tell caller result of phy_change()

In 664fcf123a30e (net: phy: Threaded interrupts allow some simplification)
the phy_interrupt system was changed to use a traditional threaded
interrupt scheme instead of a workqueue approach.

With this change, the phy status check moved into phy_change, which
did not report back to the caller whether or not the interrupt was
handled. This means that, in the case of a shared phy interrupt,
only the first phydev's interrupt registers are checked (since
phy_interrupt() would always return IRQ_HANDLED). This leads to
interrupt storms when it is a secondary device that's actually the
interrupt source.
