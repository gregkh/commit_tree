dm thin: fix documentation relative to low water mark threshold

Fixes:
1. The use of "exceeds" when the opposite of exceeds, falls below,
was meant.
2. Properly speaking, a table can not exceed a threshold.

It emphasizes the important point, which is that it is the userspace
daemon's responsibility to check for low free space when a device
is resumed, since it won't get a special event indicating low free
space in that situation.
