MIPS: XPA: Standardise readx/writex accessors

Now that we are using assembler macros to implement XPA instructions on
toolchains which don't support them, pass Cop0 register names to the
__{readx,writex}_32bit_c0_register macros in $n format rather than
register numbers. Also pass a register select which may be useful in
future (for example for MemoryMapID field of WatchHi registers on
I6500).

This is to make them consistent with the normal Cop0 register access
macros which they were originally based on.
