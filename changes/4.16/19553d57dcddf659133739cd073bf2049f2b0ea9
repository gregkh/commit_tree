drm/i915/selftests: Free mock_i915->drm.mode_config

Even for the mock i915 device, we need to initialise the
drm.mode_config, as we may ultimately query whether there are any KMS
users deep in the bowels of some paths (e.g. eviction). As we initialise
drm.mode_config we must cleanup after ourselves!
