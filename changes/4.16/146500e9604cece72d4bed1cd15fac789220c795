mm: get 7% more pages in a pagevec

We don't have to use an entire 'long' for the number of elements in the
pagevec; we know it's a number between 0 and 14 (now 15).  So we can
store it in a char, and then the bool packs next to it and we still have
two or six bytes of padding for more elements in the header.  That gives
us space to cram in an extra page.
