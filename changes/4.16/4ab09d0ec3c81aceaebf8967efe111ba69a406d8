drm/i915: Replace "cc-option -Wno-foo" with "cc-disable-warning foo"

To quote kbuild/makefiles.txt:

    cc-disable-warning checks if gcc supports a given warning and returns
    the commandline switch to disable it. This special function is needed,
    because gcc 4.4 and later accept any unknown -Wno-* option and only
    warn about it if there is another warning in the source file.

This is exactly what we were trying to achieve with cc-option -Wno-foo and
failed miserably.
