watchdog: sbsa: use 32-bit read for WCV

According to SBSA spec v3.1 section 5.3:
  All registers are 32 bits in size and should be accessed using
  32-bit reads and writes. If an access size other than 32 bits
  is used then the results are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.
  [...]
  The Generic Watchdog is little-endian

The current code uses readq to read the watchdog compare register
which does a 64-bit access. This fails on ThunderX2 which does not
implement 64-bit access to this register.

Fix this by using lo_hi_readq() that does two 32-bit reads.
