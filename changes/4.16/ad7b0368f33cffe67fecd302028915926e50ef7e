btrfs: tree-checker: Add checker for dir item

Add checker for dir item, for key types DIR_ITEM, DIR_INDEX and
XATTR_ITEM.

This checker does comprehensive checks for:

1) dir_item header and its data size
   Against item boundary and maximum name/xattr length.
   This part is mostly the same as old verify_dir_item().

2) dir_type
   Against maximum file types, and against key type.
   Since XATTR key should only have FT_XATTR dir item, and normal dir
   item type should not have XATTR key.

   The check between key->type and dir_type is newly introduced by this
   patch.

3) name hash
   For XATTR and DIR_ITEM key, key->offset is name hash (crc32c).
   Check the hash of the name against the key to ensure it's correct.

   The name hash check is only found in btrfs-progs before this patch.
