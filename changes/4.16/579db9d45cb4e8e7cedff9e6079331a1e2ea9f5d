virt: Add vboxguest VMMDEV communication code

This commits adds a header describing the hardware interface for the
Virtual Box Guest PCI device used in Virtual Box virtual machines and
utility functions for talking to the Virtual Box hypervisor over this
interface.

PCI device which offers the /dev/vboxguest ioctl API and by the vboxfs
driver which offers folder sharing support.
