x86/kvm/vmx: do not use vm-exit instruction length for fast MMIO when running nested

I was investigating an issue with seabios >= 1.10 which stopped working
for nested KVM on Hyper-V. The problem appears to be in
handle_ept_violation() function: when we do fast mmio we need to skip
the instruction so we do kvm_skip_emulated_instruction(). This, however,
depends on VM_EXIT_INSTRUCTION_LEN field being set correctly in VMCS.
However, this is not the case.

Intel's manual doesn't mandate VM_EXIT_INSTRUCTION_LEN to be set when
EPT MISCONFIG occurs. While on real hardware it was observed to be set,
some hypervisors follow the spec and don't set it; we end up advancing
IP with some random value.

I checked with Microsoft and they confirmed they don't fill
VM_EXIT_INSTRUCTION_LEN on EPT MISCONFIG.

Fix the issue by doing instruction skip through emulator when running
nested.
