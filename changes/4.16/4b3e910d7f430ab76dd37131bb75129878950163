Input: edt-ft5x06 - fix error handling for factory mode on non-M06

When attempting enter factory mode on firmware that does not support it,
we'd error out, but leave the device with interrupts disabled, and thus
touch not working. Fix it by moving the check before we disable
interrupts/allocate memory for debug buffers.
