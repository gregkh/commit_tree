Revert "usb: musb: host: don't start next rx urb if current one failed"

This reverts commit dbac5d07d13e330e6706813c9fde477140fb5d80.

commit dbac5d07d13e ("usb: musb: host: don't start next rx urb if current one failed")
along with commit b5801212229f ("usb: musb: host: clear rxcsr error bit if set")
try to solve the issue described in [1], but the latter alone is
sufficient, and the former causes the issue as in [2], so now revert it.
