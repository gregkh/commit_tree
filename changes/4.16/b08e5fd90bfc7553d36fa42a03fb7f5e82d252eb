arm_pmu: Use disable_irq_nosync when disabling SPI in CPU teardown hook

Commit 6de3f79112cc ("arm_pmu: explicitly enable/disable SPIs at hotplug")
moved all of the arm_pmu IRQ enable/disable calls to the CPU hotplug hooks,
regardless of whether they are implemented as PPIs or SPIs. This can
lead to us sleeping from atomic context due to disable_irq blocking:

 | BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/irq/manage.c:112

Since the interrupt is always CPU-affine and this code is running with
interrupts disabled, we can just use disable_irq_nosync as we know there
isn't a concurrent invocation of the handler to worry about.
