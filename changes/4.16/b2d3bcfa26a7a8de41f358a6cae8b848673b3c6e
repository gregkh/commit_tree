net: core: Expose number of link up/down transitions

Expose the number of times the link has been going UP or DOWN, and
update the "carrier_changes" counter to be the sum of these two events.
While at it, also update the sysfs-class-net documentation to cover:
carrier_changes (3.15), carrier_up_count (4.16) and carrier_down_count
(4.16)
