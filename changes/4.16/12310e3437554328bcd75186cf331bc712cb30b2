kprobes: Propagate error from arm_kprobe_ftrace()

Improve error handling when arming ftrace-based kprobes. Specifically, if
we fail to arm a ftrace-based kprobe, register_kprobe()/enable_kprobe()
should report an error instead of success. Previously, this has lead to
confusing situations where register_kprobe() would return 0 indicating
success, but the kprobe would not be functional if ftrace registration
during the kprobe arming process had failed. We should therefore take any
errors returned by ftrace into account and propagate this error so that we
do not register/enable kprobes that cannot be armed. This can happen if,
for example, register_ftrace_function() finds an IPMODIFY conflict (since
kprobe_ftrace_ops has this flag set) and returns an error. Such a conflict
is possible since livepatches also set the IPMODIFY flag for their ftrace_ops.

arm_all_kprobes() keeps its current behavior and attempts to arm all
kprobes. It returns the last encountered error and gives a warning if
not all probes could be armed.

This patch is based on Petr Mladek's original patchset (patches 2 and 3)
back in 2015, which improved kprobes error handling, found here:

   https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/26/452

However, further work on this had been paused since then and the patches
were not upstreamed.
