PCI: Remove PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_RSRC use on arm and arm64

On arm, PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_RSRC is used only in pcibios_assign_all_busses(),
which helps decide whether to reconfigure bridge bus numbers.  It has
nothing to do with BAR assignments.  On arm64 and powerpc,
pcibios_assign_all_busses() tests PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_BUS, which makes more
sense.

Align arm with arm64 and powerpc, so they all use PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_BUS for
pcibios_assign_all_busses().

Remove PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_RSRC from the generic, Tegra, Versatile, and
R-Car drivers.  These drivers are used only on arm or arm64, where
PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_RSRC is not used after this change, so removing it
should have no effect.

No functional change intended.
