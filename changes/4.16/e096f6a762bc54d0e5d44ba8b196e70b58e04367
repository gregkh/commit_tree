idr: Add idr_alloc_u32 helper

All current users of idr_alloc_ext() actually want to allocate a u32
and idr_alloc_u32() fits their needs better.

Like idr_get_next(), it uses a 'nextid' argument which serves as both
a pointer to the start ID and the assigned ID (instead of a separate
minimum and pointer-to-assigned-ID argument).  It uses a 'max' argument
rather than 'end' because the semantics that idr_alloc has for 'end'
don't work well for unsigned types.

Since idr_alloc_u32() returns an errno instead of the allocated ID, mark
it as __must_check to help callers use it correctly.  Include copious
kernel-doc.  Chris Mi <chrism@mellanox.com> has promised to contribute
test-cases for idr_alloc_u32.
