vmxnet3: remove redundant initialization of pointer 'rq'

Pointer rq is being initialized but this value is never read, it
is being updated inside a for-loop. Remove the initialization and
move it into the scope of the for-loop.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c:2763:27: warning: Value stored
to 'rq' during its initialization is never read
