ARM: lpc3250: fix uda1380 gpio numbers

dtc warns about obviously incorrect GPIO numbers for the audio codec
on both lpc32xx boards:

arch/arm/boot/dts/lpc3250-phy3250.dtb: Warning (gpios_property): reset-gpio property size (12) too small for cell size 3 in /ahb/apb/i2c@400A0000/uda1380@18
arch/arm/boot/dts/lpc3250-phy3250.dtb: Warning (gpios_property): power-gpio property size (12) too small for cell size 3 in /ahb/apb/i2c@400A0000/uda1380@18
arch/arm/boot/dts/lpc3250-ea3250.dtb: Warning (gpios_property): reset-gpio property size (12) too small for cell size 3 in /ahb/apb/i2c@400A0000/uda1380@18
arch/arm/boot/dts/lpc3250-ea3250.dtb: Warning (gpios_property): power-gpio property size (12) too small for cell size 3 in /ahb/apb/i2c@400A0000/uda1380@18

It looks like the nodes are written for a different binding that combines
the GPIO number into a single number rather than a bank/number pair.
I found the right numbers on stackexchange.com, so this patch fixes
the warning and has a reasonable chance of getting things to actually
work.
