net/mlx5e: Move dynamic interrupt coalescing code to include/linux

This move allows drivers to add private structure elements to track the
number of packets, bytes, and interrupts events per ring.  A driver
also defines a workqueue handler to act on this collected data once per
poll and modify the coalescing parameters per ring.
