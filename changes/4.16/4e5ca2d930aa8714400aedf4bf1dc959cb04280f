drm/tilcdc: ensure nonatomic iowrite64 is not used

Add a check to ensure iowrite64 is only used if it is atomic.

It was decided in [1] that the tilcdc driver should not be using an
atomic operation (so it was left out of this patchset). However, it turns
out that through the drm code, a nonatomic header is actually included:

include/linux/io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h
is included from include/drm/drm_os_linux.h:9:0,
            from include/drm/drmP.h:74,
            from include/drm/drm_modeset_helper.h:26,
            from include/drm/drm_atomic_helper.h:33,
            from drivers/gpu/drm/tilcdc/tilcdc_crtc.c:19:

And thus, without this change, this patchset would inadvertantly
change the behaviour of the tilcdc driver.
