xtensa: move fixmap and kmap just above the KSEG

The virtual address space between the page table and the VMALLOC region
is big enough to host KASAN shadow map and there's enough space between
the VMALLOC area and KSEG for the fixmap and kmap.
Move fixmap and kmap to the gap between VMALLOC area and KSEG, just
above the KSEG. Reorder entries in the kernel memory layout printing
code. Drop duplicate PGTABLE_START definition, use
XCHAL_PAGE_TABLE_VADDR instead.
