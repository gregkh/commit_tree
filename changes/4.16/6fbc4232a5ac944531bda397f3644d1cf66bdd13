hwmon: (dell-smm) Disable fan support for Dell Vostro 3360

Calling fan related SMM functions implemented by Dell BIOS firmware on Dell
Vostro 3360 freeze kernel for about 500ms.

Unfortunately, it is unlikely for Dell to fix this since the machine
is pretty old, so this commit just disables fan support to make the
system usable again.

Via "force" module param fan support can be enabled.
