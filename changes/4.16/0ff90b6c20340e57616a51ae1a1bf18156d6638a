netfilter: nf_flow_offload: fix use-after-free and a resource leak

flow_offload_del frees the flow, so all associated resource must be
freed before.

Since the ct entry in struct flow_offload_entry was allocated by
flow_offload_alloc, it should be freed by flow_offload_free to take care
of the error handling path when flow_offload_add fails.

While at it, make flow_offload_del static, since it should never be
called directly, only from the gc step
