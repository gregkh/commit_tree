NFS: Fix unstable write completion

We do want to respect the FLUSH_SYNC argument to nfs_commit_inode() to
ensure that all outstanding COMMIT requests to the inode in question are
complete. Currently we may exit early from both nfs_commit_inode() and
nfs_write_inode() even if there are COMMIT requests in flight, or unstable
writes on the commit list.

In order to get the right semantics w.r.t. sync_inode(), we don't need
to have nfs_commit_inode() reset the inode dirty flags when called from
nfs_wb_page() and/or nfs_wb_all(). We just need to ensure that
nfs_write_inode() leaves them in the right state if there are outstanding
commits, or stable pages.
