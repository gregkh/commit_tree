net: phy: Have __phy_modify return 0 on success

__phy_modify would return the old value of the register before it was
modified. Thus on success, it does not return 0, but a positive value.
Thus functions using phy_modify, which is a wrapper around
__phy_modify, can start returning > 0 on success, rather than 0. As a
result, breakage has been noticed in various places, where 0 was
assumed.

Code inspection does not find any current location where the return of
the old value is currently used. So have __phy_modify return 0 on
success. When there is a real need for the old value, either a new
accessor can be added, or an additional parameter passed.
