drm/i915/pmu: Wire up engine busy stats to PMU

We can use engine busy stats instead of the sampling timer for
better accuracy.

By doing this we replace the stohastic sampling with busyness
metric derived directly from engine activity. This is context
switch interrupt driven, so as accurate as we can get from
software tracking.

As a secondary benefit, we can also not run the sampling timer
in cases only busyness metric is enabled.

v2: Rebase.
v3:
 * Rebase, comments.
 * Leave engine busyness controls out of workers.
v4: Checkpatch cleanup.
v5: Added comment to pmu_needs_timer change.
v6:
 * Rebase.
 * Fix style of some comments. (Chris Wilson)
v7: Rebase and commit message update. (Chris Wilson)
v8: Add delayed stats disabling to improve accuracy in face of
    CPU hotplug events.
v9: Rebase.
v10: Rebase - i915_modparams.enable_execlists removal.
