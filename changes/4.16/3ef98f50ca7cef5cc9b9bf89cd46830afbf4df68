drm/i915: Print an error message for a reset failure on gen2

Since on gen2, we do not universally have a GPU reset implementation, we
fail i915_reset() at intel_has_gpu_reset(). However, this is also
intentionally disabled for CI testing and so it only has a debug
message. Promote that debug message to a user-facing error message that
should explain why their machine became unusable following the GPU hang.
