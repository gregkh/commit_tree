net: phy: Add general dummy stubs for MMD register access

For some phy devices, even though they don't support the MMD extended
register access, it does have some side effect if we are trying to
read/write the MMD registers via indirect method. So introduce general
dummy stubs for MMD register access which these devices can use to avoid
such side effect.
