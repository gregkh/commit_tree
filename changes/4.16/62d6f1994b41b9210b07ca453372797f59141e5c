media: lirc: scancode rc devices should have a lirc device too

Now that the lirc interface supports scancodes, RC scancode devices
can also have a lirc device. The only receiving feature they will have
enabled is LIRC_CAN_REC_SCANCODE.

Note that CEC devices have no lirc device, since they can be controlled
from their /dev/cecN chardev.
