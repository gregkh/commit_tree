null_blk: remove explicit 'select FAULT_INJECTION'

Selecting FAULT_INJECTION causes a Kconfig warning when CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL
is not set:

warning: (BLK_DEV_NULL_BLK && DRM_I915_SELFTEST) selects FAULT_INJECTION which has unmet direct dependencies (DEBUG_KERNEL)

The other drivers that use FAULT_INJECTION tend to have a separate
Kconfig symbol for turning on that feature, so let's do the same
thing here. This may add a bit more complexity than we like, but
it avoids the warning and is more consistent with the rest of the
kernel.
