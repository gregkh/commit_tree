IB/{core/cm}: Fix generating a return AH for RoCEE

When computing a UD reverse path (return AH) from a WC the code was not
doing a route lookup anchored in a specific netdevice. This caused several
bugs, including broken IPv6 link-local address support in RoCEv2. [1]

This fixes the lookup by determining the GID table entry that the HW
matched to the SGID for the WC and then using the netdevice from that
entry to perform the route and ND lookup for the 'DGID' to build a return
AH.

RoCE GID table management ensures that right upper netdevices of the
physical netdevices are added. Therefore init_ah_from_wc doesn't need to
perform such check.

Now that route lookup is done based on the netdevice of the GID entry,
simplify code to not have ifindex and vlan pointers.  As part of that,
refactor to have netdevice as input parameter.  This is already discussed
at [2].

Finally ib_init_ah_from_wc resolves dmac for unicast GID in similar way as
what ib_resolve_eth_dmac() does. So ib_resolve_eth_dmac is refactored to
split for unicast and non unicast GIDs, so that it can be reused by
ib_init_ah_from_wc.

While we are at refactoring ib_resolve_eth_dmac(), it is further
simplified

(a) to avoid hoplimit as optional parameter, as there is only one
    user who always queries hoplimit.
(b) for empty line.
(c) avoided zero initialization of ret.
(d) removed as exported symbol as only ib core uses it.

For IPv6, this is tested using simple rping test as below.
 rping -sv -a ::0
 rping -c -a fe80::268a:7ff:fe55:4661%ens2f1 -C 1 -v -d
