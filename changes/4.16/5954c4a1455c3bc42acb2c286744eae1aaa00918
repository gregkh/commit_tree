ASoC: rt5645: add fallback case for jack detection support

Commit 78f5605c0329 ("ASoC: rt5645: cleanup DMI matching code") did a
lot of useful cleanups. This patch adds a default case to enable
jack detection if there is no pdata, device property or quirk.

The chosen jd-mode3 is the most common and should limit the addition
of new DMI-based quirks. Existing DMI quirks which only set this mode
are left as is and not removed.
