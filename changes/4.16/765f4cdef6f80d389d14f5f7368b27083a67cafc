kconfig: use default 'yy' prefix for lexer and parser

Flex and Bison provide an option to change the prefix of globally-
visible symbols.  This is useful to link multiple lexers and/or
parsers into the same executable.  However, Kconfig (and any other
host programs in kernel) uses a single lexer and parser.  I do not
see a good reason to change the default 'yy' prefix.
