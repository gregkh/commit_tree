libata: Make Crucial BX100 500GB LPM quirk apply to all firmware versions

Commit b17e5729a630 ("libata: disable LPM for Crucial BX100 SSD 500GB
drive"), introduced a ATA_HORKAGE_NOLPM quirk for Crucial BX100 500GB SSDs
but limited this to the MU02 firmware version, according to:
http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/support-ssd-firmware

MU02 is the last version, so there are no newer possibly fixed versions
and if the MU02 version has broken LPM then the MU01 almost certainly
also has broken LPM, so this commit changes the quirk to apply to all
firmware versions.
