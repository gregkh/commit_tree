nubus: Rename struct nubus_dev

It is misleading to call a functional resource a "device". In adopting
the Linux Driver Model, the struct device will be embedded in struct
nubus_board. That will compound the terminlogy problem because drivers
will bind with boards, not with functional resources. Avoid this by
renaming struct nubus_dev as struct nubus_rsrc. "Functional resource"
is the vendor's terminology so this helps avoid confusion.
