btrfs: Remove redundant FLAG_VACANCY

Commit 9036c10208e1 ("Btrfs: update hole handling v2") added the
FLAG_VACANCY to denote holes, however there was already a consistent way
of flagging extents which represent hole - ->block_start =
EXTENT_MAP_HOLE. And also the only place where this flag is checked is
in the fiemap code, but the block_start value is also checked and every
other place in the filesystem detects holes by using block_start
value's. So remove the extra flag. This survived a full xfstest run.
