ARM: dts: imx7: Move nodes which have no reg property out of bus

Move usbphynop1, usbphynop2, usbhypnop3, replicator and timer and nodes
from soc node to root node.

The nodes that have been moved do not have any register properties and thus
shouldn't be placed on the bus.

This fixes the following build warnings with W=1:

arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d-cl-som-imx7.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/replicator missing or empty reg/ranges property
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d-cl-som-imx7.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/timer missing or empty reg/ranges property
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d-cl-som-imx7.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/aips-bus@30800000/usbphynop1 missing or empty reg/ranges property
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d-cl-som-imx7.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/aips-bus@30800000/usbphynop3 missing or empty reg/ranges property
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d-cl-som-imx7.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/aips-bus@30800000/usbphynop2 missing or empty reg/ranges property

Based on a patch from Simon Horman for r8a7795.dtsi.
