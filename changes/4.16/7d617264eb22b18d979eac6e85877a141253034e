drm/amdgpu/dce: Don't turn off DP sink when disconnected

Turning off the sink in this case causes various issues, because
userspace expects it to stay on until it turns it off explicitly.

Instead, turn the sink off and back on when a display is connected
again. This dance seems necessary for link training to work correctly.
