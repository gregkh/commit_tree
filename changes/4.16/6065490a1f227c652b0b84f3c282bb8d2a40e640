staging: rtl8712: remove redundant initialization to 'rfPath'

The value stored to rfPath during initialization is never read, the
following switch statement re-assigns it a new value on all the
case and default paths. Hence the initialization is redundant and
can be removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/staging/rtl8712/rtl871x_mp.c:544:5: warning: Value stored to
'rfPath' during its initialization is never read
