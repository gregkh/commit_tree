media: i2c: ov7740: use gpio/consumer.h instead of gpio.h

When built on a platform without gpiolib support, we run into
a couple of compile errors in ov7740, including:

drivers/media/i2c/ov7740.c: In function 'ov7740_set_power':
drivers/media/i2c/ov7740.c:307:4: error: implicit declaration of function 'gpiod_direction_output'; did you mean 'gpio_direction_output'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    gpiod_direction_output(ov7740->pwdn_gpio, 0);
drivers/media/i2c/ov7740.c:914:4: error: 'GPIOD_OUT_HIGH' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'GPIOF_INIT_HIGH'?

Changing it to use the correct header file solves the problem.
