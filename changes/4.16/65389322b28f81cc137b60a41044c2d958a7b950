IB/mlx: Set slid to zero in Ethernet completion struct

IB spec says that a lid should be ignored when link layer is Ethernet,
for example when building or parsing a CM request message (CA17-34).
However, since ib_lid_be16() and ib_lid_cpu16()  validates the slid,
not only when link layer is IB, we set the slid to zero to prevent
false warnings in the kernel log.
