bnxt_en: don't update cpr->rx_bytes with uninitialized length len

Currently in the cases where cmp_type == CMP_TYPE_RX_L2_TPA_START_CMP or
CMP_TYPE_RX_L2_TPA_END_CMP the exit path updates cpr->rx_bytes with an
uninitialized length len.  Fix this by adding a new exit path that does
not update the cpr stats with the bogus length len and remove the unused
label next_rx_no_prod.
