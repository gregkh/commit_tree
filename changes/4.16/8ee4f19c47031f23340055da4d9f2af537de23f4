drm/i915/pmu: Stop averaging with the previous sample

Averaging with the previous sample brings a small statistical improvement
to sampling counters, but can leek a little bit of state from a current
client to the next which mulls the border between past and present for
observing clients.

This is because on event enable clients record the current counter value
and use it as reference, but with rapid off-on event cycles, and due the
delayed nature of sampling timer self-disarm, previous sample value does
not get cleared under these circumstances.

Solution is to stop averaging with the previous sample. This has a small
downside of losing some precision with short and spiky signals, but the
alternatives look too complicated for the benefit.
