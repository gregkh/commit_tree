drm/i915: Use snprintf to avoid line-break when pretty-printing engines

When printing the execlist ports, we first print the ELSP header then
follow it with the pretty-printed request. Since switching to
drm_printer and show the output via printk, it automatically appends a
newline to each call (unlike the old seq_printf output). To avoid the
unwanted line break, construct the ELSP request header in a temporary
buffer.
