gpiolib: Keep returning EPROBE_DEFER when we should

Commits c85823390215 ("gpio: of: Support SPI nonstandard GPIO properties")
and 6a537d48461d ("gpio: of: Support regulator nonstandard GPIO
properties") have introduced a regression in the way error codes from
of_get_named_gpiod_flags are handled.

Previously, those errors codes were returned immediately, but the two
commits mentioned above are now overwriting the error pointer, meaning that
whatever value has been returned will be dropped in favor of whatever the
two new functions will return.

This might not be a big deal except for EPROBE_DEFER, on which GPIOlib
customers will depend on, and that will now be returned as an hard error
which means that they will not probe anymore, instead of gently deferring
their probe.

Since EPROBE_DEFER basically means that we have found a valid property but
there was no GPIO controller registered to handle it, fix this issues by
returning it as soon as we encounter it.
