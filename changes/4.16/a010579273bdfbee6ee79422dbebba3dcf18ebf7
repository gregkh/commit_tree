batman-adv: Change batman_adv.h license to MIT

The ISC license is considered as not recommended in "Linux kernel licensing
rules". It should only be used for existing code or for importing code from
a different project with that license.

But the kernel still has the similar sounding MIT/Expat license under the
preferred licenses. Switching to this license for this relatively new file
should therefore allow batman-adv to better follow the new licensing rules.
