drm/i915: Automatic i915_switch_context for legacy

During request construction, after pinning the context we know whether
or not we have to emit a context switch. So move this common operation
from every caller into i915_gem_request_alloc() itself.

v2: Always submit the request if we emitted some commands during request
construction, as typically it also involves changes in global state.
