dm: add unstriped target

This device mapper "unstriped" target remaps and unstripes I/O so it
is issued solely on a single drive in a HW RAID0 or dm-striped target.

In a 4 drive HW RAID0 the striped target exposes 1/4th of the LBA range
as a virtual drive.  Each I/O to that virtual drive will only be issued
to the 1 drive that was selected of the 4 drives in the HW RAID0.

This unstriped target is most useful for Intel NVMe drives that have
multiple cores but that do not have firmware control to pin separate LBA
ranges to each discrete cpu core.
