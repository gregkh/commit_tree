slimbus: Add support for 'clock-pause' feature

Per SLIMbus specification, a reconfiguration sequence known as
'clock pause' needs to be broadcast over the bus while entering low-
power mode. Clock-pause is initiated by the controller driver.
To exit clock-pause, controller typically wakes up the framer device.
Since wakeup precedure is controller-specific, framework calls it via
controller's function pointer to invoke it.
