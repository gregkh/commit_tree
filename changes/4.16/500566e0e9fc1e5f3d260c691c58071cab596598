arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: normalize I2C and SPI nodes

The QUP core can be used either for I2C or SPI, so the same IP is mapped
by a driver or the other. SPI bindings use a leading 0 for the start
address and a size of 0x600, I2C bindings don't have the leading 0 and
have a size 0x1000.

To make them more similar, add the leading 0 to I2C bindings and changes
the size to 0x500 for all of them, as this is the actual size of these
blocks. Also align the second entry of the clocks array.
