IB/cm: Fix sleeping while spin lock is held

In case of LAP are used for RoCE, it can lead to a problem of sleeping a
context while spin lock is held in below flow.

cm_lap_handler
	->spin_lock
	-> <..switch_case..>
	-> cm_init_av_for_response
		-> ib_init_ah_from_wc
			-> rdma_addr_find_l2_eth_by_grh
				wait_for_completion()

Therefore ah attribute initialization is done for incoming lap requests
outside of the lock context.
