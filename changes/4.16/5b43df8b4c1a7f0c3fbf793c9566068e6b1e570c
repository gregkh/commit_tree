mmc: dw_mmc: Avoid accessing registers in runtime suspended state

cat /sys/kernel/debug/mmc0/regs will hang up the system since
it's in runtime suspended state, so the genpd and biu_clk is
off. This patch fixes this problem by calling pm_runtime_get_sync
to wake it up before reading the registers.
