ASoC: rk3399_gru_sound: Map BTN_0 to KEY_PLAYPAUSE

The Android 3.5mm Headset jack specification mentions that BTN_0 should
be mapped to KEY_MEDIA, but this is less logical than KEY_PLAYPAUSE,
which has much broader userspace support.

For example, the Chrome OS userspace now supports KEY_PLAYPAUSE to toggle
play/pause of videos and audio, but does not handle KEY_MEDIA.

Furthermore, Android itself now supports KEY_PLAYPAUSE equivalently, as the
new USB headset spec requires KEY_PLAYPAUSE for BTN_0.
