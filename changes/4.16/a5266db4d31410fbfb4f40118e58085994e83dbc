drm/i915: Acquire PUNIT->PMIC bus for intel_uncore_forcewake_reset()

intel_uncore_forcewake_reset() does forcewake puts and gets as such
we need to make sure that no-one tries to access the PUNIT->PMIC bus
(on systems where this bus is shared) while it runs, otherwise bad
things happen.

Normally this is taken care of by the i915_pmic_bus_access_notifier()
which does an intel_uncore_forcewake_get(FORCEWAKE_ALL) when some other
driver tries to access the PMIC bus, so that later forcewake gets are
no-ops (for the duration of the bus access).

But intel_uncore_forcewake_reset gets called in 3 cases:
1) Before registering the pmic_bus_access_notifier
2) After unregistering the pmic_bus_access_notifier
3) To reset forcewake state on a GPU reset

In all 3 cases the i915_pmic_bus_access_notifier() protection is
insufficient.

This commit fixes this race by calling iosf_mbi_punit_acquire() before
calling intel_uncore_forcewake_reset(). In the case where it is called
directly after unregistering the pmic_bus_access_notifier, we need to
hold the punit-lock over both calls to avoid a race where
intel_uncore_fw_release_timer() may execute between the 2 calls.
