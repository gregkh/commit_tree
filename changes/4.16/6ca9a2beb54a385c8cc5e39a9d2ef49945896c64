drm/i915: Unwind i915_gem_init() failure

Since Michal introduced new user controllable errors other than -EIO
during i915_gem_init(), we need to actually unwind on the error path as
we have to abort the module load (and we expect to do so cleanly!).

As we now teardown key state and then mark the driver as wedged (on
EIO), we have to be careful to not allow ourselves to resume and
unwedge, thus attempting to use the uninitialised driver.

v2: Try not to free driver state for the suppressed EIO
v3: Use load-fault-injection to test both error/recovery paths.
