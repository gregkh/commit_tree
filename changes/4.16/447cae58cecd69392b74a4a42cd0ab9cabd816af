ALSA: usb-audio: Fix UAC2 get_ctl request with a RANGE attribute

The layout of the UAC2 Control request and response varies depending on
the request type. With the current implementation, only the Layout 2
Parameter Block (with the 2-byte sized RANGE attribute) is handled
properly. For the Control requests with the 1-byte sized RANGE attribute
(Bass Control, Mid Control, Tremble Control), the response is parsed
incorrectly.

This commit:
* fixes the wLength field value in the request
* fixes parsing the range values from the response
