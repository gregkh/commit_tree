tracing/kprobe: bpf: Compare instruction pointer with original one

Compare instruction pointer with original one on the
stack instead using per-cpu bpf_kprobe_override flag.

This patch also consolidates reset_current_kprobe() and
preempt_enable_no_resched() blocks. Those can be done
in one place.
