scsi: qla2xxx: Fix Relogin being triggered too fast

Current driver design schedules relogin process via DPC thread every 1
second. In a large fabric, this DPC thread tries to schedule too many
jobs and might get overloaded. As a result of this processing of DPC
thread, it can schedule relogin earlier than 1 second.
