soundwire: fix sign extension when shifting buf[2] 24 places

The buf[2] left shift by 24 bits is promoted to int (32 bit signed)
and then signed-extended to unsigned long long. Hence if the upper
bit to buf[2] is set then all the upper bits of addr end up as 1.
Fix this by casting it to u64 before shifting it. Also replace the
unsigned long long casts to u64 casts to match the same type of
addr.
