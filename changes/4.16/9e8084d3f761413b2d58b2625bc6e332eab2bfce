arm64: Implement thread_struct whitelist for hardened usercopy

While ARM64 carries FPU state in the thread structure that is saved and
restored during signal handling, it doesn't need to declare a usercopy
whitelist, since existing accessors are all either using a bounce buffer
(for which whitelisting isn't checking the slab), are statically sized
(which will bypass the hardened usercopy check), or both.
