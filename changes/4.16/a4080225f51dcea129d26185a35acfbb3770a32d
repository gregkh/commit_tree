mmc: cqhci: support for command queue enabled host

This patch adds CMDQ support for command-queue compatible
hosts.

Command queue is added in eMMC-5.1 specification. This
enables the controller to process upto 32 requests at
a time.

Adrian Hunter contributed renaming to cqhci, recovery, suspend
and resume, cqhci_off, cqhci_wait_for_idle, and external timeout
handling.
