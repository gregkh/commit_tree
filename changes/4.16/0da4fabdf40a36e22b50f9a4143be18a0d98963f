kbuild: test --build-id linker flag by ld-option instead of cc-ldoption

'--build-id' is passed to $(LD), so it should be tested by 'ld-option'.

This seems a kind of misconversion when ld-option was renamed to
cc-ldoption.

Commit f86fd3066052 ("kbuild: rename ld-option to cc-ldoption") renamed
all instances of 'ld-option' to 'cc-ldoption'.

Then, commit 691ef3e7fdc1 ("kbuild: introduce ld-option") re-added
'ld-option' as a new implementation.
