scsi: ses: don't ask for diagnostic pages repeatedly during probe

We are testing if there is a match with the ses device in a loop by
calling ses_match_to_enclosure(), which will issue scsi receive
diagnostics commands to the ses device for every device on the same
host.  On one of our boxes with 840 disks, it takes a long time to load
the driver:

[root@g1b-oss06 ~]# time modprobe ses

real	40m48.247s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.196s

With the patch:

[root@g1b-oss06 ~]# time modprobe ses

real	0m17.915s
user	0m0.008s
sys	0m0.053s

Note that we still need to refresh page 10 when we see a new disk to
create the link.
