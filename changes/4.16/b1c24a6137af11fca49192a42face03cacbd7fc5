drm/i915: Unwind incomplete legacy context switches

The legacy context switch for ringbuffer submission is multistaged,
where each of those stages may fail. However, we were updating global
state after some stages, and so we had to force the incomplete request
to be submitted because we could not unwind. Save the global state
before performing the switches, and so enable us to unwind back to the
previous global state should any phase fail. We then must cancel the
request instead of submitting it should the construction fail.

v2: s/saved_ctx/from_ctx/; s/ctx/to_ctx/ etc.
