dm: fix dropped return code from dm_get_bdev_for_ioctl

dm_get_bdev_for_ioctl()'s return of 0 or 1 must be the result from
prepare_ioctl (1 means the ioctl was issued to a partition, 0 means it
wasn't).  Unfortunately commit 519049afea ("dm: use blkdev_get rather
than bdgrab when issuing pass-through ioctl") reused the variable 'r'
to store the return from blkdev_get() that follows prepare_ioctl()
-- whereby dropping prepare_ioctl()'s result on the floor.

This can lead to an ioctl or persistent reservation being issued to a
partition going unnoticed, which implies the extra permission check for
CAP_SYS_RAWIO is skipped.

Fix this by using a different variable to store blkdev_get()'s return.
