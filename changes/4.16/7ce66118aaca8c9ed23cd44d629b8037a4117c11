drm/amd: Update kgd_kfd interface for resuming SDMA queues

Add wptr and mm parameters to hqd_sdma_load and pass these parameters
from device_queue_manager through the mqd_manager.

SDMA doesn't support polling while the engine believes it's idle. The
driver must update the wptr. The new parameters will be used for looking
up the updated value from the specified mm when SDMA queues are resumed
after being disabled.
