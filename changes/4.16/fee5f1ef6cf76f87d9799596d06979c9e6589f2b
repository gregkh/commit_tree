memory: brcmstb: dpfe: support new way of passing data from the DCPU

The DCPU can now send message data in two ways:
  - via the data RAM, as before (this is now message type 0)
  - via the message RAM (this is message type 1)

In order to support both methods, we check the message type of the
response (bits 31:28) and then treat the offset (bits 27:0)
accordingly.
