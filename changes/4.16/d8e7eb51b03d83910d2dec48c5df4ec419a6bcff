Coccinelle: alloc_cast: Add more memory allocating functions to the list

Add more memory allocating functions that are frequently used in the
kernel code to the existing list and remove the useless casts where
it is unnecessary.

But preserve those casts having __attribute__ such as __force, __iomem,
etc. which are used by Sparse in the static analysis of the code.

Also remove two blank lines at EOF.
