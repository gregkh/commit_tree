PM / core: Assign the wakeup_path status flag in __device_prepare()

The PM core in the device_prepare() phase, resets the wakeup_path status
flag to the value of device_may_wakeup(). This means if a ->prepare() or a
->suspend() callback for the device would update the device's wakeup
setting, this doesn't become reflected in the wakeup_path status flag.

In general this isn't a problem, because wakeup settings are not supposed
to be changed (via for example calling device_set_wakeup_enable()) during
any system wide suspend/resume phase.  Nevertheless there are some users,
which can be considered as legacy, that don't conform to this behaviour.

These legacy cases should be corrected, however until that is done, let's
address the issue from the PM core, by moving the assignment of the
wakeup_path status flag to the __device_suspend() phase and after the
->suspend() callback has been invoked.
