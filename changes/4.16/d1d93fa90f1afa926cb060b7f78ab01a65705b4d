KVM: SVM: Add MSR-based feature support for serializing LFENCE

In order to determine if LFENCE is a serializing instruction on AMD
processors, MSR 0xc0011029 (MSR_F10H_DECFG) must be read and the state
of bit 1 checked.  This patch will add support to allow a guest to
properly make this determination.

Add the MSR feature callback operation to svm.c and add MSR 0xc0011029
to the list of MSR-based features.  If LFENCE is serializing, then the
feature is supported, allowing the hypervisor to set the value of the
MSR that guest will see.  Support is also added to write (hypervisor only)
and read the MSR value for the guest.  A write by the guest will result in
a #GP.  A read by the guest will return the value as set by the host.  In
this way, the support to expose the feature to the guest is controlled by
the hypervisor.
