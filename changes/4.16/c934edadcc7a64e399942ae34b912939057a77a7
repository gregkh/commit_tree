dm table: allow upgrade from bio-based to specialized bio-based variant

In practice this is really only meaningful in the context of the DM
multipath target (which uses dm_table_set_type() to set the type of
device DM should create via its "queue_mode" option).

So this change allows a DM multipath device with "queue_mode bio" to be
upgraded from DM_TYPE_BIO_BASED to DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED -- iff the
underlying device(s) are NVMe.

DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED is just a DM core implementation detail that
allows for NVMe-specific optimizations (e.g. use direct_make_request
instead of generic_make_request).  If in the future there is no benefit
or need to distinguish NVMe vs not: then it will be removed.
