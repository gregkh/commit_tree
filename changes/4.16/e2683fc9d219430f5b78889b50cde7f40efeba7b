btrfs: tree-check: reduce stack consumption in check_dir_item

I've noticed that the updated item checker stack consumption increased
dramatically in 542f5385e20cf97447 ("btrfs: tree-checker: Add checker
for dir item")

tree-checker.c:check_leaf                    +552 (176 -> 728)

The array is 255 bytes long, dynamic allocation would slow down the
sanity checks so it's more reasonable to keep it on-stack. Moving the
variable to the scope of use reduces the stack usage again

tree-checker.c:check_leaf                    -264 (728 -> 464)
