RDMA/vmw_pvrdma: Fix usage of user response structures in ABI file

This ensures that we return the right structures back to userspace.
Otherwise, it looks like the reserved fields in the response structures
in userspace might have uninitialized data in them.

Fixes: 8b10ba783c9d ("RDMA/vmw_pvrdma: Add shared receive queue support")
Fixes: 29c8d9eba550 ("IB: Add vmw_pvrdma driver")
