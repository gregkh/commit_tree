IB/hfi1: Optimize process_receive_ib()

The arguments for trace_hfi1_rcvhdr() get computed every
time in the hot path regardless of the whether the trace
is on or off. This is seen to be costly with a profile.
The handling of fault inject isolates the verbs device for
all packets regardless of the presence of a RHF_DC_ERR error.

Fix the first by computing trace_hfi1_rcvhdr() arguments within
the trace itself, so that when the trace is off, the argument
data isn't computed. Fix the second by moving the error check to
handle_eflags() when an RHF error occurs and by testing for
RHF_DC_ERR before executing the reset of handle_eflags().
