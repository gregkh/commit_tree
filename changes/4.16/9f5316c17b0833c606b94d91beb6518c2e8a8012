Btrfs: free btrfs_device in place

It's pointless to defer it to a kthread helper as we're not under a
special context.

For reference, commit 1f78160ce1b1 ("Btrfs: using rcu lock in the reader
side of devices list") introduced RCU freeing for device structures.

Originally the blkdev_put was called from free_device and rcu_barrier had
to be called. This is no longer required, bdev and our device structures
are now freed separately.
