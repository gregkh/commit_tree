team: move dev_mc_sync after master_upper_dev_link in team_port_add

The same fix as in 'bonding: move dev_mc_sync after master_upper_dev_link
in bond_enslave' is needed for team driver.

The panic can be reproduced easily:

  ip link add team1 type team
  ip link set team1 up
  ip link add link team1 vlan1 type vlan id 80
  ip link set vlan1 master team1
