drm/sun4i: Enable the output on the pins (tcon0)

I noticed that with 4.16-rc1 LVDS output on A83T based TBS A711 tablet doesn't
work (there's output but it's garbled). I compared some older patches for LVDS
support with the mainlined ones and this change is missing from mainline Linux.

I don't know what the register does exactly and the harcoded register value
doesn't inspire much confidence that it will work in a general case, so I'm
sending this RFC.

This patch fixes the issue on A83T.
