Revert "ARM: dts: exynos: Add missing interrupt-controller properties to Exynos5410 PMU"

This reverts commit 6737b081409a4373e9d02c75aea7b916481e31b5.

Unlike on Exynos5420-family, on Exynos5410 the PMU is not an interrupt
controller so it should not handle interrupts of RTC.  The DTC warning
(addressed by mentioned commit) should be fixed by not routing RTC
interrupts to PMU.
