scsi: lpfc: don't dereference localport before it has been null checked

localport is being dereferenced to assign lport and then immediately
afterwards localport is being sanity checked to see if it is null.  Fix
this by only dereferencing localport until after it has been null
checked.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1463038 ("Dereference before null check")
