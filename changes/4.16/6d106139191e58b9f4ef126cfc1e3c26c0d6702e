i2c: mpc: get MPC8xxx I2C clock prescaler before using it in calculations

Obtaining the actual I2C clock prescaler value in mpc_i2c_setup_8xxx() only
happens when the clock parameter is set to something other than
MPC_I2C_CLOCK_LEGACY. When the clock parameter is exactly
MPC_I2C_CLOCK_LEGACY, the prescaler parameter is used in arithmetic
division as provided by the caller, resulting in a division by zero
for the majority of processors supported by the module.

Avoid division by zero by obtaining the actual I2C clock prescaler
in mpc_i2c_setup_8xxx() unconditionally regardless of the passed clock
value.
