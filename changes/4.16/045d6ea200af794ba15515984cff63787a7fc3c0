scsi: qla2xxx: Don't call dma_free_coherent with IRQ disabled.

The logo ELS command allocates dma coherent memory for the
data payload and serialize the completions. When this command
times out, the timeout routine completes the thread waiting
for completion which in turn cleanup resources allocated for
this ELS command processing. Don't call generic sp->free
routine when this ELS command times out to avoid to double
freeing of the same resources.
