serial: max310x: Do not hard-code the IRQ type

As suggested by Russell King, a driver should not really care about bits
such as the interrupt polarity or whether it is edge- or level-
triggered. The reasons for that include:

- an upstream IRQ controller which cannot support edge- or
level-triggered interrupts,
- board design with a built-in inverter

The interrupt type is being already specified by the Device Tree,
anyway. Other drivers (gpio/gpio-tc3589x.c for example) already work in
this way, delegating the proper IRQ line setup to the DT and not
specifying anything by hand.

Also, there's no reason to have the IRQ flags split between two places.
The SPI probing is the only entry point anyway.
