scsi: lpfc: Correct driver deregistrations with host nvme transport

The driver's interaction with the host nvme transport has been incorrect
for a while. The driver did not wait for the unregister callbacks
(waited only 5 jiffies). Thus the driver may remove objects that may be
referenced by subsequent abort commands from the transport, and the
actual unregister callback was effectively a noop. This was especially
problematic if the driver was unloaded.

The driver now waits for the unregister callbacks, as it should, before
continuing with teardown.
