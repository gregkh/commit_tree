ip: do not set RFS core on error queue reads

We should only record RPS on normal reads and writes.
In single threaded processes, all calls record the same state. In
multi-threaded processes where a separate thread processes
errors, the RFS table mispredicts.

Note that, when CONFIG_RPS is disabled, sock_rps_record_flow
is a noop and no branch is added as a result of this patch.
