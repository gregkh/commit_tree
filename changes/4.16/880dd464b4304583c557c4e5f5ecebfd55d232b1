can: ifi: Repair the error handling

The new version of the IFI CANFD core has significantly less complex
error state indication logic. In particular, the warning/error state
bits are no longer all over the place, but are all present in the
STATUS register. Moreover, there is a new IRQ register bit indicating
transition between error states (active/warning/passive/busoff).

This patch makes use of this bit to weed out the obscure selective
INTERRUPT register clearing, which was used to carry over the error
state indication into the poll function. While at it, this patch
fixes the handling of the ACTIVE state, since the hardware provides
indication of the core being in ACTIVE state and that in turn fixes
the state transition indication toward userspace. Finally, register
reads in the poll function are moved to the matching subfunctions
since those are also no longer needed in the poll function.
