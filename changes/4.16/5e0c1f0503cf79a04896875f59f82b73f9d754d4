rtlwifi: check for array overflow

This is merged by Ping-Ke Shih from commit dc33bd4309d2 ("staging:
rtlwifi: check for array overflow"), and the original commit log is
reserved below.

Smatch is distrustful of the "capab" value and marks it as user
controlled.  I think it actually comes from the firmware?  Anyway, I
looked at other drivers and they added a bounds check and it seems like
a harmless thing to have so I have added it here as well.
