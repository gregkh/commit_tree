media: intel-ipu3: cio2: fix building with large PAGE_SIZE

The driver apparently assumes that the device uses the same page size
as the CPU, but also assumes that this is 4096 bytes. On architectures
with a larger page size like 65536 bytes, we get a warning about an
integer overflow:

drivers/media/pci/intel/ipu3/ipu3-cio2.c: In function 'cio2_fbpt_entry_init_dummy':
arch/arm64/include/asm/page-def.h:28:20: error: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Werror=overflow]
 #define PAGE_SIZE  (_AC(1, UL) << PAGE_SHIFT)
                    ^
drivers/media/pci/intel/ipu3/ipu3-cio2.h:404:26: note: in expansion of macro 'PAGE_SIZE'
 #define CIO2_PAGE_SIZE   PAGE_SIZE
                          ^~~~~~~~~
drivers/media/pci/intel/ipu3/ipu3-cio2.c:172:3: note: in expansion of macro 'CIO2_PAGE_SIZE'
   CIO2_PAGE_SIZE / sizeof(u32) * CIO2_MAX_LOPS;

Obviously this won't work, but the driver is also unlikely to ever be
used on such an architecture, so the easiest workaround is to define
the CIO2_PAGE_SIZE macro to the size that the hardware actually uses.
