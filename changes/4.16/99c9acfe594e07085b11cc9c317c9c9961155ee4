crypto: exynos - Reseed PRNG after generating 2^16 random bytes

Reseed PRNG after reading 65 kB of randomness. Although this may reduce
performance, in most cases the loss is not noticeable. Also the time
based threshold for reseeding is changed to one second. Reseeding is
performed whenever either limit is exceeded.

Reseeding of a PRNG does not increase entropy, but it helps preventing
backtracking the internal state of the device from its output sequence,
and hence, prevents potential attacker from predicting numbers to be
generated.
