net: link_watch: mark bonding link events urgent

It takes 1sec for bond link down notification to hit user-space
when all slaves of the bond go down. 1sec is too long for
protocol daemons in user-space relying on bond notification
to recover (eg: multichassis lag implementations in user-space).
Since the link event code already marks team device port link events
 as urgent, this patch moves the code to cover all lag ports and master.
