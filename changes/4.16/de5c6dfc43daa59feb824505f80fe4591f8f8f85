tee: optee: Update protocol definitions

There were changes in REE<->OP-TEE ABI recently.
Now ABI allows us to pass non-contiguous memory buffers as list of
pages to OP-TEE. This can be achieved by using new parameter attribute
OPTEE_MSG_ATTR_NONCONTIG.

OP-TEE also is able to use all non-secure RAM for shared buffers. This
new capability is enabled with OPTEE_SMC_SEC_CAP_DYNAMIC_SHM flag.

This patch adds necessary definitions to the protocol definition files at
Linux side.
