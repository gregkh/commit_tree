net: Define usercopy region in struct proto slab cache

In support of usercopy hardening, this patch defines a region in the
struct proto slab cache in which userspace copy operations are allowed.
Some protocols need to copy objects to/from userspace, and they can
declare the region via their proto structure with the new usersize and
useroffset fields. Initially, if no region is specified (usersize ==
0), the entire field is marked as whitelisted. This allows protocols
to be whitelisted in subsequent patches. Once all protocols have been
annotated, the full-whitelist default can be removed.

This region is known as the slab cache's usercopy region. Slab caches
can now check that each dynamically sized copy operation involving
cache-managed memory falls entirely within the slab's usercopy region.

This patch is modified from Brad Spengler/PaX Team's PAX_USERCOPY
whitelisting code in the last public patch of grsecurity/PaX based on my
understanding of the code. Changes or omissions from the original code are
mine and don't reflect the original grsecurity/PaX code.
