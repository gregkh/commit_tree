drm/i915: Remove redundant intel_autoenable_gt_powersave()

Now that we always execute a context switch upon module load, there is
no need to queue a delayed task for doing so. The purpose of the delayed
task is to enable GT powersaving, for which we need the HW state to be
valid (i.e. having loaded a context and initialised basic state). We
used to defer this operation as historically it was slow (due to slow
register polling, fixed with commit 1758b90e38f5 ("drm/i915: Use a hybrid
scheme for fast register waits")) but now we have a requirement to save
the default HW state.

v2: Load the kernel context (to provide the power context) upon resume.
