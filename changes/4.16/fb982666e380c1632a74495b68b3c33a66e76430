tools/bpftool: fix bpftool build with bintutils >= 2.9

Bpftool build is broken with binutils version 2.29 and later.
The cause is commit 003ca0fd2286 ("Refactor disassembler selection")
in the binutils repo, which changed the disassembler() function
signature.

Fix this by adding a new "feature" to the tools/build/features
infrastructure and make it responsible for decision which
disassembler() function signature to use.
