hwmon: (pmbus/ir35221) Remove unnecessary scaling

The ir35221 datasheet describes specific scaling factors for a number of
commands which the current driver applies when reading.
However now that the ir35221 has been tested on machines with more
easily verifiable readings these descriptions have turned out to be
superfluous and reading each command according to the linear format is
sufficient.
