net: ipv6: keep sk status consistent after datagram connect failure

On unsuccesful ip6_datagram_connect(), if the failure is caused by
ip6_datagram_dst_update(), the sk peer information are cleared, but
the sk->sk_state is preserved.

If the socket was already in an established status, the overall sk
status is inconsistent and fouls later checks in datagram code.

Fix this saving the old peer information and restoring them in
case of failure. This also aligns ipv6 datagram connect() behavior
with ipv4.

v1 -> v2:
 - added missing Fixes tag
