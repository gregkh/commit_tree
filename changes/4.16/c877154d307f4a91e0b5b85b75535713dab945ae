ubifs: Fix uninitialized variable in search_dh_cookie()

fs/ubifs/tnc.c: In function ‘search_dh_cookie’:
fs/ubifs/tnc.c:1893: warning: ‘err’ is used uninitialized in this function

Indeed, err is always used uninitialized.

According to an original review comment from Hyunchul, acknowledged by
Richard, err should be initialized to -ENOENT to avoid the first call to
tnc_next().  But we can achieve the same by reordering the code.
