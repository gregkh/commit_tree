Input: silead - add support for capactive home button found on some x86 tablets

On some x86 tablets with a silead touchscreen the windows logo on the
front is a capacitive home button. Touching this button results in a touch
with bits 12-15 of the Y coordinates set, while normally only the lower 12
are used.

Detect this and report a KEY_LEFTMETA press when this happens. Note for
now we only respond to the Y coordinate bits 12-15 containing 0x01, on some
tablets *without* a capacative button I've noticed these bits containing
0x04 when crossing the edges of the screen.
