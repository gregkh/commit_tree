btrfs: use proper endianness accessors for super_copy

The fs_info::super_copy is a byte copy of the on-disk structure and all
members must use the accessor macros/functions to obtain the right
value.  This was missing in update_super_roots and in sysfs readers.

Moving between opposite endianness hosts will report bogus numbers in
sysfs, and mount may fail as the root will not be restored correctly. If
the filesystem is always used on a same endian host, this will not be a
problem.

Fix this by using the btrfs_set_super...() functions to set
fs_info::super_copy values, and for the sysfs, use the cached
fs_info::nodesize/sectorsize values.
