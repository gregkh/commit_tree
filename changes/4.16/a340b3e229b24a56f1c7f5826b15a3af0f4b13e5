kvm: Map PFN-type memory regions as writable (if possible)

For EPT-violations that are triggered by a read, the pages are also mapped with
write permissions (if their memory region is also writable). That would avoid
getting yet another fault on the same page when a write occurs.

This optimization only happens when you have a "struct page" backing the memory
region. So also enable it for memory regions that do not have a "struct page".
