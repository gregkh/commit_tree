scripts: kernel-doc: parse next structs/unions

There are several places within the Kernel tree with nested
structs/unions, like this one:

  struct ingenic_cgu_clk_info {
    const char *name;
    enum {
      CGU_CLK_NONE = 0,
      CGU_CLK_EXT = BIT(0),
      CGU_CLK_PLL = BIT(1),
      CGU_CLK_GATE = BIT(2),
      CGU_CLK_MUX = BIT(3),
      CGU_CLK_MUX_GLITCHFREE = BIT(4),
      CGU_CLK_DIV = BIT(5),
      CGU_CLK_FIXDIV = BIT(6),
      CGU_CLK_CUSTOM = BIT(7),
    } type;
    int parents[4];
    union {
      struct ingenic_cgu_pll_info pll;
      struct {
        struct ingenic_cgu_gate_info gate;
        struct ingenic_cgu_mux_info mux;
        struct ingenic_cgu_div_info div;
        struct ingenic_cgu_fixdiv_info fixdiv;
      };
      struct ingenic_cgu_custom_info custom;
    };
  };

Currently, such struct is documented as:

	**Definition**

	::
	struct ingenic_cgu_clk_info {
	    const char * name;
	};

	**Members**

	``name``
	  name of the clock

With is obvioulsy wrong. It also generates an error:
	drivers/clk/ingenic/cgu.h:169: warning: No description found for parameter 'enum'

However, there's nothing wrong with this kernel-doc markup: everything
is documented there.

It makes sense to document all fields there. So, add a
way for the core to parse those structs.

With this patch, all documented fields will properly generate
documentation.
