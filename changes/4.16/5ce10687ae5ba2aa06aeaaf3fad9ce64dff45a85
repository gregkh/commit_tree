drm/amdkfd: Make kfd_process reference counted

This will be used to elliminate the use of the process lock for
preventing concurrent process destruction. This will simplify lock
dependencies between KFD and KGD.

This also simplifies the process destruction in a few ways:
* Don't allocate work struct dynamically
* Remove unnecessary hack that increments mm reference counter
* Remove unnecessary process locking during destruction
