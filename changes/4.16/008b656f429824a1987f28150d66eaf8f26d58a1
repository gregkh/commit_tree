IB/core: Remove the locking for character device bitmaps

Remove the locks that protect character device bitmaps of
uverbs, umad and issm.

The character device bitmaps are accessed in "client->add" and
"client->remove" calls from ib_register_device and ib_unregister_device
respectively. These calls are already protected by the "device_mutex"
mutex. Thus, the spinlocks are not needed.
