sctp: Define usercopy region in SCTP proto slab cache

The SCTP socket event notification subscription information need to be
copied to/from userspace. In support of usercopy hardening, this patch
defines a region in the struct proto slab cache in which userspace copy
operations are allowed. Additionally moves the usercopy fields to be
adjacent for the region to cover both.

example usage trace:

    net/sctp/socket.c:
        sctp_getsockopt_events(...):
            ...
            copy_to_user(..., &sctp_sk(sk)->subscribe, len)

        sctp_setsockopt_events(...):
            ...
            copy_from_user(&sctp_sk(sk)->subscribe, ..., optlen)

        sctp_getsockopt_initmsg(...):
            ...
            copy_to_user(..., &sctp_sk(sk)->initmsg, len)

This region is known as the slab cache's usercopy region. Slab caches
can now check that each dynamically sized copy operation involving
cache-managed memory falls entirely within the slab's usercopy region.

This patch is modified from Brad Spengler/PaX Team's PAX_USERCOPY
whitelisting code in the last public patch of grsecurity/PaX based on my
understanding of the code. Changes or omissions from the original code are
mine and don't reflect the original grsecurity/PaX code.
