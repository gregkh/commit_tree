net/sched: fix idr leak in the error path of tcf_vlan_init()

tcf_vlan_init() can fail after the idr has been successfully reserved.
When this happens, every subsequent attempt to configure vlan rules using
the same idr value will systematically fail with -ENOSPC, unless the first
attempt was done using the 'replace' keyword.

Fix this in tcf_vlan_init(), ensuring that tcf_idr_release() is called on
the error path when the idr has been reserved, but not yet inserted. Also,
don't test 'ovr' in the error path, to avoid a 'replace' failure implicitly
become a 'delete' that leaks refcount in act_vlan module:

 # rmmod act_vlan; modprobe act_vlan
 # tc action add action vlan push id 5 index 100
 # tc action replace action vlan push id 7 index 100

 # tc action list action vlan
 #
 # rmmod act_vlan
 rmmod: ERROR: Module act_vlan is in use
