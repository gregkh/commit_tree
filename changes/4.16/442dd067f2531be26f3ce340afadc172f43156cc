media: exynos-gsc: Drop obsolete capabilities

Setting both V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_CAPTURE_MPLANE and V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_OUTPUT_MPLANE
for mem2mem video nodes is obsolete since commit f0476a83d61a ("[media]
V4L: Add capability flags for memory-to-memory devices"). It was enough
time to adapt all users to the new flags, so drop the legacy caps for now
to match other mem2mem drivers.
