fscrypt: calculate NUL-padding length in one place only

Currently, when encrypting a filename (either a real filename or a
symlink target) we calculate the amount of NUL-padding twice: once
before encryption and once during encryption in fname_encrypt().  It is
needed before encryption to allocate the needed buffer size as well as
calculate the size the symlink target will take up on-disk before
creating the symlink inode.  Calculating the size during encryption as
well is redundant.

Remove this redundancy by always calculating the exact size beforehand,
and making fname_encrypt() just add as much NUL padding as is needed to
fill the output buffer.
