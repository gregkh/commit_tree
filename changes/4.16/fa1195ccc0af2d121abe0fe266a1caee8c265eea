perf tools: Fix copyfile_offset update of output offset

We need to increase output offset in each iteration, not decrease it as
we currently do.

I guess we were lucky to finish in most cases in first iteration, so the
bug never showed. However it shows a lot when working with big (~4GB)
size data.
