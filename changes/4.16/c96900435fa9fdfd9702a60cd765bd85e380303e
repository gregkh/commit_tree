xfs: use %px for data pointers when debugging

Starting with commit 57e734423ad ("vsprintf: refactor %pK code out of
pointer"), the behavior of the raw '%p' printk format specifier was
changed to print a 32-bit hash of the pointer value to avoid leaking
kernel pointers into dmesg.  For most situations that's good.

This is /undesirable/ behavior when we're trying to debug XFS, however,
so define a PTR_FMT that prints the actual pointer when we're in debug
mode.

Note that %p for tracepoints still prints the raw pointer, so in the
long run we could consider rewriting some of these messages as
tracepoints.
