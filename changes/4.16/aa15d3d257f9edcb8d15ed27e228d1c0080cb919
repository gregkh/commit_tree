USB: remove the URB_NO_FSBR flag

The URB_NO_FSBR flag has never really been used.  It was introduced as
a potential way for UHCI to minimize PCI bus usage (by not attempting
full-speed bulk and control transfers more than once per frame), but
the flag was not set by any drivers.

There's no point in keeping it around.  This patch simplifies the API
by removing it.  Unfortunately, it does have to be kept as part of the
usbfs ABI, but at least we can document in
include/uapi/linux/usbdevice_fs.h that it doesn't do anything.
