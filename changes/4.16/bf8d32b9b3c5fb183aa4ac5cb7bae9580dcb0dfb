btrfs: remove redundant check in btrfs_get_extent_fiemap

Before returning hole_em in btrfs_get_fiemap_extent we check if it's different
than null. However, by the time this null check is triggered we already know
hole_em is not null because it means it points to the em we found and it
has already been dereferenced.
