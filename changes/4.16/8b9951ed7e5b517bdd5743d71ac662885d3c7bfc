ARM64 / cpuidle: Use new cpuidle macro for entering retention state

CPU_PM_CPU_IDLE_ENTER_RETENTION skips calling cpu_pm_enter() and
cpu_pm_exit(). By not calling cpu_pm functions in idle entry/exit
paths we can reduce the latency involved in entering and exiting
the low power idle state.

On ARM64 based Qualcomm server platform we measured below overhead
for calling cpu_pm_enter and cpu_pm_exit for retention states.

workload: stress --hdd #CPUs --hdd-bytes 32M  -t 30
	Average overhead of cpu_pm_enter - 1.2us
	Average overhead of cpu_pm_exit  - 3.1us
