drm/i915: Nuke crtc->plane

Eliminate crtc->plane since it's pretty much a layering violation.
We can always get the plane via crtc->primary if we actually need it.

The only ugly thing left is plane_to_crtc_mapping[], but that's
still needed by the pre-g4x watermark code.

v2: Removed a misplaced comment change (Daniel)
v3: Rebase due to fbc crtc->y usage removal
v4: s/plane/i9xx_plane/ etc. (James)
