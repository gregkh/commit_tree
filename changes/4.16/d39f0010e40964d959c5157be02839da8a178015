dm raid: fix raid_resume() to keep raid set frozen as needed

During a reshape request: if userspace reloads a "raid" table multiple
times, resulting in multiple superblock reads, the raid set needs to
stay frozen until all config changes (chunk size, layout data_offset,
delta_disks) have been stored in the superblocks and respective flags
cleared.
