staging: most: core: make functions print_links and most_match static

The functions print_links and most_match static are local to the source
and do not need to be in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'print_links' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'most_match' was not declared. Should it be static?
