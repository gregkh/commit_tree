fscrypt: new helper function - fscrypt_get_symlink()

Filesystems also have duplicate code to support ->get_link() on
encrypted symlinks.  Factor it out into a new function
fscrypt_get_symlink().  It takes in the contents of the encrypted
symlink on-disk and provides the target (decrypted or encoded) that
should be returned from ->get_link().
