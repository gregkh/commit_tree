net/mlx5e: Sync netdev vxlan ports at open

When mlx5_core is loaded it is expected to sync ports
with all vxlan devices so it can support vxlan encap/decap.
This is done via udp_tunnel_get_rx_info(). Currently this
call is set in mlx5e_nic_enable() and if the netdev is not in
NETREG_REGISTERED state it will not be called.

Normally on load the netdev state is not NETREG_REGISTERED
so udp_tunnel_get_rx_info() will not be called.

Moving udp_tunnel_get_rx_info() to mlx5e_open() so
it will be called on netdev UP event and allow encap/decap.
