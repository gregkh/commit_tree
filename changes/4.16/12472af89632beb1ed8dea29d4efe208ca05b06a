s390/qeth: fix overestimated count of buffer elements

qeth_get_elements_for_range() doesn't know how to handle a 0-length
range (ie. start == end), and returns 1 when it should return 0.
Such ranges occur on TSO skbs, where the L2/L3/L4 headers (and thus all
of the skb's linear data) are skipped when mapping the skb into regular
buffer elements.

This overestimation may cause several performance-related issues:
1. sub-optimal IO buffer selection, where the next buffer gets selected
   even though the skb would actually still fit into the current buffer.
2. forced linearization, if the element count for a non-linear skb
   exceeds QETH_MAX_BUFFER_ELEMENTS.

Rather than modifying qeth_get_elements_for_range() and adding overhead
to every caller, fix up those callers that are in risk of passing a
0-length range.
