net: aquantia: Introduce new AQC devices and capabilities

A number of new AQC devices is going to be released. To support more
flexible capabilities management a number of static caps instances is now
declared. Devices now are mainly differs by supported speeds, but in future
more parameters will be customized. A set of AQC100 devices have
fibre media, not twisted pair - this is also reflected in
new capabilities definitions.

HW level also now directly exports hw_ops for each of A0/B0 hardware.

PCI configuration now uses a device configuration table where each
device ID is explicitly mapped with hardware OPs and capabilities
structures.
