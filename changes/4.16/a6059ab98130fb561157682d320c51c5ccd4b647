clk: Show symbolic clock flags in debugfs

Currently the virtual "clk_flags" file in debugfs shows the numeric
value of the top-level framework flags for the specified clock.
Hence the user must manually interpret these values.

Moreover, on big-endian 64-bit systems, the wrong half of the value is
shown, due to the cast from "unsigned long *" to "u32 *".

Fix both issues by showing the symbolic flag names instead.
Any non-standard flags are shown as a hex number.
