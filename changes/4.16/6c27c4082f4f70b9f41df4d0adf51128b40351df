arm64: kaslr: Put kernel vectors address in separate data page

The literal pool entry for identifying the vectors base is the only piece
of information in the trampoline page that identifies the true location
of the kernel.

This patch moves it into a page-aligned region of the .rodata section
and maps this adjacent to the trampoline text via an additional fixmap
entry, which protects against any accidental leakage of the trampoline
contents.
