arm64: Fix TTBR + PAN + 52-bit PA logic in cpu_do_switch_mm

In cpu_do_switch_mm(.) with ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN=y we apply phys_to_ttbr
to a value that already has an ASID inserted into the upper bits. For
52-bit PA configurations this then can give us TTBR0_EL1 registers that
cause translation table walks to attempt to access non-zero PA[51:48]
spuriously. Ultimately leading to a Synchronous External Abort on level
1 translation.

This patch re-arranges the logic in cpu_do_switch_mm(.) such that
phys_to_ttbr is called before the ASID is inserted into the TTBR0 value.
