staging: ccree: fix memory leaks in cc_ivgen_init

The current error exit path in function cc_ivgen_init via label
'out' free's resources from the drvdata->ivgen_handle context.
However, drvdata->ivgen_handle has not been assigned to the
context ivgen_ctx at this point, so the resources are not freed.
Fix this by setting drvdata->ivgen_handle to ivgen_ctx as early
as possible so that the clean up error exit return path can free
the resources.
