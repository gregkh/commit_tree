psci: add CPU_IDLE dependency

I ran into a build error for the psci_checker:

drivers/firmware/psci_checker.o: In function `psci_checker':
psci_checker.c:(.init.text+0x528): undefined reference to `cpuidle_devices'

As far as I can tell, this is simply a very rare combination of options,
but the problem has existed since the code was initially added.
Adding a Kconfig dependency makes it build properly.
