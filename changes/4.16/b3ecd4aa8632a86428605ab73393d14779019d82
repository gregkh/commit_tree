KVM: s390: vsie: use READ_ONCE to access some SCB fields

Another VCPU might try to modify the SCB while we are creating the
shadow SCB. In general this is no problem - unless the compiler decides
to not load values once, but e.g. twice.

For us, this is only relevant when checking/working with such values.
E.g. the prefix value, the mso, state of transactional execution and
addresses of satellite blocks.

E.g. if we blindly forward values (e.g. general purpose registers or
execution controls after masking), we don't care.

Leaving unpin_blocks() untouched for now, will handle it separately.

The worst thing right now that I can see would be a missed prefix
un/remap (mso, prefix, tx) or using wrong guest addresses. Nothing
critical, but let's try to avoid unpredictable behavior.
