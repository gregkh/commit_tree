cifs: Fix missing put_xid in cifs_file_strict_mmap

If cifs_zap_mapping() returned an error, we would return without putting
the xid that we got earlier.  Restructure cifs_file_strict_mmap() and
cifs_file_mmap() to be more similar to each other and have a single
point of return that always puts the xid.
