mm/shmem: do not wait for lock_page() in shmem_unused_huge_shrink()

shmem_unused_huge_shrink() gets called from reclaim path.  Waiting for
page lock may lead to deadlock there.

There was a bug report that may be attributed to this:

  http://lkml.kernel.org/r/alpine.LRH.2.11.1801242349220.30642@mail.ewheeler.net

Replace lock_page() with trylock_page() and skip the page if we failed
to lock it.  We will get to the page on the next scan.

We can test for the PageTransHuge() outside the page lock as we only
need protection against splitting the page under us.  Holding pin oni
the page is enough for this.
