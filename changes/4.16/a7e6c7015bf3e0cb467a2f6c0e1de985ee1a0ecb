x86, memremap: fix altmap accounting at free

Commit 24b6d4164348 "mm: pass the vmem_altmap to vmemmap_free" converted
the vmemmap_free() path to pass the altmap argument all the way through
the call chain rather than looking it up based on the page.
Unfortunately that ends up over freeing altmap allocated pages in some
cases since free_pagetable() is used to free both memmap space and pte
space, where only the memmap stored in huge pages uses altmap
allocations.

Given that altmap allocations for memmap space are special cased in
vmemmap_populate_hugepages() add a symmetric / special case
free_hugepage_table() to handle altmap freeing, and cleanup the unneeded
passing of altmap to leaf functions that do not require it.

Without this change the sanity check accounting in
devm_memremap_pages_release() will throw a warning with the following
signature.

 nd_pmem pfn10.1: devm_memremap_pages_release: failed to free all reserved pages

This was missed in testing since not all configurations will trigger
