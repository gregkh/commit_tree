ASoC: bcm2835: fix hw_params error when device is in prepared state

If bcm2835 is configured as bitclock master calling hw_params()
after prepare() fails with EBUSY. This also makes it impossible to
use bcm2835 in full duplex mode.

The error is caused by the split clock setup: clk_set_rate
is called in hw_params, clk_prepare_enable in prepare. As hw_params
doesn't check if the clock was already enabled clk_set_rate
fails with EBUSY.

Fix this by moving clock startup from prepare to hw_params and
let hw_params properly deal with an already set up or enabled
clock.
