arm64: KVM: Increment PC after handling an SMC trap

When handling an SMC trap, the "preferred return address" is set
to that of the SMC, and not the next PC (which is a departure from
the behaviour of an SMC that isn't trapped).

Increment PC in the handler, as the guest is otherwise forever
stuck...
