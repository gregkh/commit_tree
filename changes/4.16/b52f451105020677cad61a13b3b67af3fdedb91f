ACPI / CPPC: Use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Add suffix ULL to constant 500 in order to give the compiler complete
information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that this
constant is used in a context that expects an expression of type
u64 (64 bits, unsigned).

The expression NUM_RETRIES * cppc_ss->latency at line 578, which at
preprocessing time translates to 500 * cppc_ss->latency is currently
being evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.
