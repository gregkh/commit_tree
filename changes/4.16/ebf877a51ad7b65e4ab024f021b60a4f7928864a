fpga: mgr: separate getting/locking FPGA manager

Previously when the user gets a FPGA manager, it was locked
and nobody else could use it for programming.

This commit makes it straightforward to save a reference to an
FPGA manager and only lock it when programming the FPGA.

Add functions that get an FPGA manager's mutex for exclusive use:
* fpga_mgr_lock
* fpga_mgr_unlock

The following functions no longer lock an FPGA manager's mutex:
* of_fpga_mgr_get
* fpga_mgr_get
* fpga_mgr_put
