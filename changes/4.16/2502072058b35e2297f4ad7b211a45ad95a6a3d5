nfsd4: don't set lock stateid's sc_type to CLOSED

There's no point I can see to

	stp->st_stid.sc_type = NFS4_CLOSED_STID;

given release_lock_stateid immediately sets sc_type to 0.

That set of sc_type to 0 should be enough to prevent it being used where
we don't want it to be; NFS4_CLOSED_STID should only be needed for
actual open stateid's that are actually closed.
