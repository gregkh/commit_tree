ARM: dts: Move most of logicpd-torpedo-37xx-devkit to logicpd-torpedo-baseboard

The Development kits consist of a SOM connected to a baseboard.  Moving most
of the devkit files to baseboard allow us to re-use much of the contents in
preparation for using it on the OMAP35xx varation of the same kit.
