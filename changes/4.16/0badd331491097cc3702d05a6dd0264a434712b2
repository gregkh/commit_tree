libbpf: complete list of strings for guessing program type

It seems that the type guessing feature for libbpf, based on the name of
the ELF section the program is located in, was inspired from
samples/bpf/prog_load.c, which was not used by any sample for loading
programs of certain types such as TC actions and classifiers, or
LWT-related types. As a consequence, libbpf is not able to guess the
type of such programs and to load them automatically if type is not
provided to the `bpf_load_prog()` function.

Add ELF section names associated to those eBPF program types so that
they can be loaded with e.g. bpftool as well.
