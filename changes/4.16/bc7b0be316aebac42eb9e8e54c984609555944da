drm/i915/gvt: Add basic debugfs infrastructure

We need debugfs entry to expose some debug information of gvt and vGPUs.
The first tool will be added is mmio-diff, which help to find the
difference values of host and vGPU mmio. It's useful for platform
enabling.

This patch just add a basic debugfs infrastructure, each vGPU has its own
sub-folder. Two simple attributes are created as a template.
