drm/tegra: dc: Remove redundant spinlock

The spinlock is only used to serialize accesses to the DC_CMD_INT_MASK
register. However, this register is accesses either with interrupts
masked (in tegra_crtc_atomic_enable()) or protected by the vbl_lock and
vblank_time_lock spinlocks of the DRM device. Therefore, these accesses
don't need any extra serialization and the lock can be removed.
