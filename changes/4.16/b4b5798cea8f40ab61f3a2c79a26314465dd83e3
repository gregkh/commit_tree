ext2: auto disable dax instead of failing mount

Bring the ext2 filesystem in line with xfs that only warns and continues
when the "-o dax" option is specified to mount and the backing device
does not support dax. This is in preparation for removing dax support
from devices that do not enable get_user_pages() operations on dax
mappings. In other words 'gup' support is required and configurations
that were using so called 'page-less' dax will be converted back to
using the page cache.

Removing the broken 'page-less' dax support is a pre-requisite for
removing the "EXPERIMENTAL" warning when mounting a filesystem in dax
mode.
