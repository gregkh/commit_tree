signal/openrisc: Fix do_unaligned_access to send the proper signal

While reviewing the signal sending on openrisc the do_unaligned_access
function stood out because it is obviously wrong.  A comment about an
si_code set above when actually si_code is never set.  Leading to a
random si_code being sent to userspace in the event of an unaligned
access.

Looking further SIGBUS BUS_ADRALN is the proper pair of signal and
si_code to send for an unaligned access. That is what other
architectures do and what is required by posix.

Given that do_unaligned_access is broken in a way that no one can be
relying on it on openrisc fix the code to just do the right thing.
