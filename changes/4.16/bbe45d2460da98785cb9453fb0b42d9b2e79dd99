mbcache: revert "fs/mbcache.c: make count_objects() more robust"

This reverts commit d5dabd633922ac5ee5bcc67748f7defb8b211469.

This patch did absolutely nothing, because ->c_entry_count is unsigned.

In addition if there is a bug in how mbcache maintains its entry count,
it needs to be fixed, not just hacked around.  (There is no obvious bug,
though.)
