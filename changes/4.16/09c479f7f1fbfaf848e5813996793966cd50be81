auxdisplay: img-ascii-lcd: add missing MODULE_DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR/LICENSE

This change resolves a new compile-time warning
when built as a loadable module:

WARNING: modpost: missing MODULE_LICENSE() in drivers/auxdisplay/img-ascii-lcd.o
see include/linux/module.h for more information

This adds the license as "GPL", which matches the header of the file.

MODULE_DESCRIPTION and MODULE_AUTHOR are also added.
