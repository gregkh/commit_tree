tg3: prevent scheduling while atomic splat

The problem was introduced in commit
506b0a395f26 ("[netdrv] tg3: APE heartbeat changes"). The bug occurs
because tp->lock spinlock is held which is obtained in tg3_start
by way of tg3_full_lock(), line 11571. The documentation for usleep_range()
specifically states it cannot be used inside a spinlock.
