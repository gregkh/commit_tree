bpf: Add write access to tcp_sock and sock fields

This patch adds a macro, SOCK_OPS_SET_FIELD, for writing to
struct tcp_sock or struct sock fields. This required adding a new
field "temp" to struct bpf_sock_ops_kern for temporary storage that
is used by sock_ops_convert_ctx_access. It is used to store and recover
the contents of a register, so the register can be used to store the
address of the sk. Since we cannot overwrite the dst_reg because it
contains the pointer to ctx, nor the src_reg since it contains the value
we want to store, we need an extra register to contain the address
of the sk.

Also adds the macro SOCK_OPS_GET_OR_SET_FIELD that calls one of the
GET or SET macros depending on the value of the TYPE field.
