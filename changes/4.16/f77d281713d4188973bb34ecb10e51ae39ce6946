arm64: enable 52-bit physical address support

Now that 52-bit physical address support is in place, add the kconfig
symbol to enable it. As described in ARMv8.2, the larger addresses are
only supported with the 64k granule. Also ensure that PAN is configured
(or TTBR0 PAN is not), as explained in an earlier patch in this series.
