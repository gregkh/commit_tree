PM / core: Re-structure code for clearing the direct_complete flag

To make the code more consistent, let's clear the parent's direct_complete
flag along with clearing it for suppliers, instead of as currently, when
propagating the wakeup_path flag to parents.

While changing this, let's take the opportunity to rename the affected
internal functions, to make them self-explanatory. Like this:

dpm_clear_suppliers_direct_complete -> dpm_clear_superiors_direct_complete
dpm_propagate_to_parent -> dpm_propagate_wakeup_to_parent
