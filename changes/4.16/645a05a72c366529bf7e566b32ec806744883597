alpha: osf_sys.c: fix put_tv32 regression

There was a typo in the new version of put_tv32() that caused an unguarded
access of a user space pointer, and failed to return the correct result in
gettimeofday(), wait4(), usleep_thread() and old_adjtimex().

This fixes it to give the correct behavior again.
