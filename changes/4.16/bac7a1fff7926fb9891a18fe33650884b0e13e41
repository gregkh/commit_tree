lib/ubsan: remove returns-nonnull-attribute checks

Similarly to type mismatch checks, new GCC 8.x and Clang also changed for
ABI for returns_nonnull checks.  While we can update our code to conform
the new ABI it's more reasonable to just remove it.  Because it's just
dead code, we don't have any single user of returns_nonnull attribute in
the whole kernel.

And AFAIU the advantage that this attribute could bring would be mitigated
by -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks cflag that we use to build the kernel.
So it's unlikely we will have a lot of returns_nonnull attribute in
future.

So let's just remove the code, it has no use.
