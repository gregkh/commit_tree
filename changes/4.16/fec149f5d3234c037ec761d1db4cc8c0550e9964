batman-adv: Convert packet.h to uapi header

The header file is used by different userspace programs to inject packets
or to decode sniffed packets. It should therefore be available to them as
userspace header.

Also other components in the kernel (like the flow dissector) require
access to the packet definitions to be able to decode ETH_P_BATMAN ethernet
packets.
