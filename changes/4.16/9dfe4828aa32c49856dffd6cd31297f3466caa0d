arm64: Re-order reserved_ttbr0 in linker script

Currently one resolves the location of the reserved_ttbr0 for PAN by
taking a positive offset from swapper_pg_dir. In a future patch we wish
to extend the swapper s.t. its size is determined at link time rather
than comile time, rendering SWAPPER_DIR_SIZE unsuitable for such a low
level calculation.

In this patch we re-arrange the order of the linker script s.t. instead
one computes reserved_ttbr0 by subtracting RESERVED_TTBR0_SIZE from
swapper_pg_dir.
