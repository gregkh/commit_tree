video: fbdev: riva: deprecate pci_get_bus_and_slot()

pci_get_bus_and_slot() is restrictive such that it assumes domain=0 as
where a PCI device is present. This restricts the device drivers to be
reused for other domain numbers.

Getting ready to remove pci_get_bus_and_slot() function in favor of
pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot().

struct riva_par has a pointer to struct pci_dev. Use the pci_dev member
to extract the domain information.

Change the function signature for CalcStateExt and RivaGetConfig to pass
in struct pci_dev in addition to RIVA_HW_INST so that code inside the
riva_hw.c can also calculate domain number and pass it to
pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot().
