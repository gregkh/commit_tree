crypto: stm32 - fix module device table name

This patch fix the following build failure:
  CC [M]  drivers/crypto/stm32/stm32-cryp.o
In file included from drivers/crypto/stm32/stm32-cryp.c:11:0:
drivers/crypto/stm32/stm32-cryp.c:1049:25: error: 'sti_dt_ids' undeclared here (not in a function)
 MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, sti_dt_ids);

Let's replace sti_dt_ids with stm32_dt_ids which is just declared
before.
