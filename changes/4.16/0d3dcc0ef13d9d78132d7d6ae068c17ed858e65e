perf callchains: Ask for PERF_RECORD_MMAP for data mmaps for DWARF unwinding

When we use a global DWARF setting as in:

	perf record --call-graph dwarf

According to 5c0cf22477ea ("perf record: Store data mmaps for dwarf unwind") we need
to set up some extra perf_event_attr bits.

But when we instead do a per event dwarf setting:

	perf record -e cycles/call-graph=dwarf/

This was not being done, make them equivalent.

This didn't produce any output changes in my tests while fixing up loose
ends in the per-event settings, I found it just by comparing the
perf_event_attr fields trying to find an explanation for those problems.
