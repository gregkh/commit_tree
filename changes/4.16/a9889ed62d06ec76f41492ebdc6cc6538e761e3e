spi: atmel: Implements transfers with bounce buffer

This patch enables SPI DMA transfers for Atmel SAM9 SoCs and implements a
bounce buffer for transfers which have vmalloc allocated buffers. Those
buffers are not cache coherent even if they have been transformed into sg
lists. UBIFS is affected by this cache coherency issue.

In this patch I also reverted "spi: atmel: fix corrupted data issue on SAM9
family SoCs"(7094576ccdc3acfe1e06a1e2ab547add375baf7f).
