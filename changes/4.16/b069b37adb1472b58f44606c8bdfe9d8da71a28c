netfilter: nf_defrag: mark xt_table structures 'const' again

As a side-effect of adding the module option, we now get a section
mismatch warning:

WARNING: net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_raw.o(.data+0x1c): Section mismatch in reference from the variable packet_raw to the function .init.text:iptable_raw_table_init()
The variable packet_raw references
the function __init iptable_raw_table_init()
If the reference is valid then annotate the
variable with __init* or __refdata (see linux/init.h) or name the variable:
*_template, *_timer, *_sht, *_ops, *_probe, *_probe_one, *_console

Apparently it's ok to link to a __net_init function from .rodata but not
from .data. We can address this by rearranging the logic so that the
structure is read-only again. Instead of writing to the .priority field
later, we have an extra copies of the structure with that flag. An added
advantage is that that we don't have writable function pointers with this
approach.
