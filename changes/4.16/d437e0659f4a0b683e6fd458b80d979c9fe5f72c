alpha: osf_sys.c: use timespec64 where appropriate

Some of the syscall helper functions (do_utimes, poll_select_set_timeout,
core_sys_select) have changed over the past year or two to use
'timespec64' pointers rather than 'timespec'. This was fine on alpha,
since 64-bit architectures treat the two as the same type.

However, I'd like to change that behavior and make 'timespec64' a proper
type of its own even on 64-bit architectures, and that will introduce
harmless type mismatch warnings here.

Also, I'm trying to kill off the do_gettimeofday() helper in favor of
ktime_get() and related interfaces throughout the kernel.

This changes the get_tv32/put_tv32 helper functions to also take a
timespec64 argument rather than timeval, which allows us to simplify
some of the syscall helpers a bit and avoid the type warnings.

For the moment, wait4 and adjtimex are still better off with the old
behavior, so I'm adding a special put_tv_to_tv32() helper for those.
