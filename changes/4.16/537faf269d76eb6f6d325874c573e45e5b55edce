qtnfmac: modify supported interface combinations

Update existing code handling configuration of supported interface
combinations. Current implementation is not complete since it does
not report multiple interface combinations which are incompatible
with each other. Instead current implementation packs all the
supported combinations into single entry.

In fact currently qsr10g wireless card supports the following
two distinct interface combinations:

1. STA/repeater: 1 STA and/or 1 AP
   {
     { .max = 1, .types = NL80211_IFTYPE_AP},
     { .max = 1, .types = NL80211_IFTYPE_STA},
   }

2. AP/mBSS
   {
     { .max = 8, .types = NL80211_IFTYPE_AP},
   }

The list of supported configuration is reported by firmware during
wireless card bring-up. Communication protocol between firmware
and host has been updated accordingly in order to accommodate passing
multiple interface combination entries.
