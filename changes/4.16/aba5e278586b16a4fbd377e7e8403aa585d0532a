drm/i915: Add a hook for making the engines idle (parking) and unparking

In the next patch, we will want to install a callback when the engines
(GT as a whole) become idle and similarly when they first become busy.
To enable that callback, first rename intel_engines_mark_idle() to
intel_engines_park() and provide the companion intel_engines_unpark().
