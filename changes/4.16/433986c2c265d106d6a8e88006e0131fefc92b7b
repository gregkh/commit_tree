PM / runtime: Update links_count also if !CONFIG_SRCU

Commit baa8809f6097 (PM / runtime: Optimize the use of device links)
added an invocation of pm_runtime_drop_link() to __device_link_del().
However there are two variants of that function, one for CONFIG_SRCU and
another for !CONFIG_SRCU, and the commit only modified the former.
