bpf, arm64: fix out of bounds access in tail call

I recently noticed a crash on arm64 when feeding a bogus index
into BPF tail call helper. The crash would not occur when the
interpreter is used, but only in case of JIT. Output looks as
follows:

  [  347.007486] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fffb850e96492510

In this case the index used in BPF r3 is the same as in r1
at the time of the call, meaning we fed a pointer as index;
here, it had the value 0xffff808fd7cf0500 which sits in x2.

While I found tail calls to be working in general (also for
hitting the error cases), I noticed the following in the code
emission:

  # bpftool p d j i 988
  [...]
  38:   ldr     w10, [x1,x10]
  3c:   cmp     w2, w10
  40:   b.ge    0x000000000000007c              <-- signed cmp
  44:   mov     x10, #0x20                      // #32
  48:   cmp     x26, x10
  4c:   b.gt    0x000000000000007c
  50:   add     x26, x26, #0x1
  54:   mov     x10, #0x110                     // #272
  58:   add     x10, x1, x10
  5c:   lsl     x11, x2, #3
  60:   ldr     x11, [x10,x11]                  <-- faulting insn (f86b694b)
  64:   cbz     x11, 0x000000000000007c
  [...]

Meaning, the tests passed because commit ddb55992b04d ("arm64:
bpf: implement bpf_tail_call() helper") was using signed compares
instead of unsigned which as a result had the test wrongly passing.

Change this but also the tail call count test both into unsigned
and cap the index as u32. Latter we did as well in 90caccdd8cc0
("bpf: fix bpf_tail_call() x64 JIT") and is needed in addition here,
too. Tested on HiSilicon Hi1616.

Result after patch:

  # bpftool p d j i 268
  [...]
  38:	ldr	w10, [x1,x10]
  3c:	add	w2, w2, #0x0
  40:	cmp	w2, w10

  48:	mov	x10, #0x20                  	// #32
  4c:	cmp	x26, x10
  50:	b.hi	0x0000000000000080
  54:	add	x26, x26, #0x1

  60:	lsl	x11, x2, #3
  64:	ldr	x11, [x10,x11]
  68:	cbz	x11, 0x0000000000000080
