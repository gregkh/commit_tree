leds: pm8058: Silence pointer to integer size warning

The pointer returned by of_device_get_match_data() doesn't have the same
size as u32 on 64-bit architectures, causing a compile warning when
compile-testing the driver on such platform.

Cast the return value of of_device_get_match_data() to unsigned long and
then to u32 to silence this warning.
