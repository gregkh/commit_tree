platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Support ALS on the Zenbook UX430UQ

This patch adds support for ALS on the Zenbook UX430UQ to the asus_nb_wmi
driver. It also renames "quirk_asus_ux330uak" to "quirk_asus_forceals"
because it is now used for more than one model of computer, and should
thus have a more general name.
