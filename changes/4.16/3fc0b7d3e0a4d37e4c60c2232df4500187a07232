staging: lustre: lnet: fix build warning in module.c

With the latest patches from Neil, we are now getting a build warning:

drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/selftest/module.c: In function ‘lnet_selftest_init’:
drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/selftest/module.c:98:10: warning: ‘rc’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   return rc;
          ^~

So fix this up by giving a default error value to rc.
