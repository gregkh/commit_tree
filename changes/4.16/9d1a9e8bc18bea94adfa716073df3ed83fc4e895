kconfig: Document 'if' flattening logic

It is not obvious that this might refer to an 'if', making the code
pretty cryptic:

	if (menu->list && (!menu->prompt || !menu->prompt->text)) {

Kconfig keeps the 'if' menu nodes even after flattening. Reflect that in
the example to be accurate.

No functional changes. Only comments added.
