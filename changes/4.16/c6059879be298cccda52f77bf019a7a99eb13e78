ASoC: Intel: Fix Kconfig with top-level selector

Follow network example suggested by Linus, move Intel definitions
in if/endif block and clarify in help text which options distro
configurations should enable - everything except legacy Baytrail stuff and
NOCODEC (test only)

To avoid user confusion, machine drivers are handled with a submenu made
dependent on this top-level selector.

There should be no functionality change - except that sound capabilities
are restored when using older configs without any user selection.

Note that the SND_SOC_ACPI_INTEL_MATCH config is currently filtered
out by the top-level selector. This will change in the near future to
allow for this option to be selected by both SST and SOF drivers
