kconfig: make "Selected by:" and "Implied by:" readable

Reverse dependency expressions can get rather unwieldy, especially if
a symbol is selected by more than a handful of other symbols. I.e. it's
possible to have near endless expressions like:
   A && B && !C || D || F && (G || H) || [...]

Chop these expressions into actually readable chunks:
   - A && B && !C
   - D
   - F && (G || H)
   - [...]

I.e. transform the top level OR tokens into newlines and prepend each
line with a minus. This makes the "Selected by:" and "Implied by:" blurb
much easier to read. This is done only if there is more than one top
level OR. "Depends on:" and "Range :" were deliberately left as they are.

Based on idea from Paul Bolle.
