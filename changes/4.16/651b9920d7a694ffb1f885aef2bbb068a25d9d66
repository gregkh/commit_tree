mac80211: round IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_HEADROOM up to multiple of 4

This ensures that mac80211 allocated management frames are properly
aligned, which makes copying them more efficient.
For instance, mt76 uses iowrite32_copy to copy beacon frames to beacon
template memory on the chip.
Misaligned 32-bit accesses cause CPU exceptions on MIPS and should be
avoided.
