null_blk: wire up timeouts

This is needed to ensure that we actually handle timeouts.
Without it, the queue_mode=1 path will never call blk_add_timer(),
and the queue_mode=2 path will continually just return
EH_RESET_TIMER and we never actually complete the offending request.

This was used to test the new timeout code, and the changes around
killing off REQ_ATOM_COMPLETE.
