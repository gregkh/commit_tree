powerpc/pseries: Add Initialization of VF Bars

When enabling SR-IOV in pseries platform, the VF bar properties for a
PF are reported on the device node in the device tree.

This patch adds the IOV Bar resources to Linux structures from the
device tree for later use when configuring SR-IOV by PF driver.
