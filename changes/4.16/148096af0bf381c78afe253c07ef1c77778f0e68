regulator: core: Move of_find_regulator_by_node() to of_regulator.c

As of_find_regulator_by_node() is an of function it should be moved from
core.c to of_regulator.c. It provides better separation of device tree
functions from the core and allows other of_functions in of_regulator.c
to resolve device_node to regulator_dev. This will be useful for
implementation of parsing coupled regulators properties.

Declare of_find_regulator_by_node() function in internal.h as well as
regulator_class and dev_to_rdev(), as they are needed by
of_find_regulator_by_node().
