drm/i915: Add a strong mb to resetting the has-CS-interrupt bit

After a reset, the state of the CSB registers are scrubbed and not valid
until a powercontext is reloaded. We only know when a powercontext has
been reloaded once we see a CS-interrupt, before then we must ignore the
CSB registers within the execlists_submission_tasklet. However, glk is
sporadically dying with an illegal CSB pointer value (both in the HSWP
and mmio) suggesting that it is running with the CS-interrupt bit set
before the powercontext has been reloaded. Make sure the clearing of
that bit is serialised on reset with the re-enabling of the tasklet.
