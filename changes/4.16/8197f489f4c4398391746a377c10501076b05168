spi: imx: Fix failure path leak on GPIO request error correctly

In commit 974488e4ce1e ("spi: imx: Fix failure path leak on GPIO request
error"), spi_bitbang_start() was moved later in the probe sequence.  But
this doesn't work, as spi_bitbang_start() has to be called before
requesting GPIOs because the GPIO data in the spi master is populated when
the master is registed, and that doesn't happen until spi_bitbang_start()
is called.  The default only works if one uses one CS.

So add a failure path call to spi_bitbang_stop() to fix the leak.
