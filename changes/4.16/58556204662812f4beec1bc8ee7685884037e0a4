gpio: Add GPIO support for the ACCES PCIe-IDIO-24 family

The ACCES PCIe-IDIO-24 device provides 56 lines of digital I/O (24 lines
of optically-isolated non-polarized digital inputs for AC and DC control
signals, 24 lines of isolated solid state FET digital outputs, and 8
non-isolated TTL/CMOS compatible programmable I/O). An interrupt is
generated when any of the inputs change state (low to high or high to
low).

Input filter control is not supported by this driver, and input filters
are deactivated by this driver. These devices are capable of
get_multiple and set_multiple functionality, but these functions have
not yet been implemented for this driver. Change-Of-State (COS)
detection functionality may be configured to fire interrupts on
exclusively rising/falling edges, but this driver currently only
implements COS detection for either both edges or none.
