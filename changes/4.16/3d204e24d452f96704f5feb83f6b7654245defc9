fscrypt: remove 'ci' parameter from fscrypt_put_encryption_info()

fscrypt_put_encryption_info() is only called when evicting an inode, so
the 'struct fscrypt_info *ci' parameter is always NULL, and there cannot
be races with other threads.  This was cruft left over from the broken
key revocation code.  Remove the unused parameter and the cmpxchg().

Also remove the #ifdefs around the fscrypt_put_encryption_info() calls,
since fscrypt_notsupp.h defines a no-op stub for it.
