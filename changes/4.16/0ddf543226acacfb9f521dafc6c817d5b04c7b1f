xdp/mlx5: setup xdp_rxq_info

The mlx5 driver have a special drop-RQ queue (one per interface) that
simply drops all incoming traffic. It helps driver keep other HW
objects (flow steering) alive upon down/up operations.  It is
temporarily pointed by flow steering objects during the interface
setup, and when interface is down. It lacks many fields that are set
in a regular RQ (for example its state is never switched to
MLX5_RQC_STATE_RDY). (Thanks to Tariq Toukan for explanation).

The XDP RX-queue info for this drop-RQ marked as unused, which
allow us to use the same takedown/free code path as other RX-queues.

Driver hook points for xdp_rxq_info:
 * reg   : mlx5e_alloc_rq()
 * unused: mlx5e_alloc_drop_rq()
 * unreg : mlx5e_free_rq()

Tested on actual hardware with samples/bpf program
