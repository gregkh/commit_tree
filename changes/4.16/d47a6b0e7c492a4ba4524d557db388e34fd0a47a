net: sched: introduce ingress/egress block index attributes for qdisc

Introduce two new attributes to be used for qdisc creation and dumping.
One for ingress block, one for egress block. Introduce a set of ops that
qdisc which supports block sharing would implement.

Passing block indexes in qdisc change is not supported yet and it is
checked and forbidded.

In future, these attributes are to be reused for specifying block
indexes for classes as well. As of this moment however, it is not
supported so a check is in place to forbid it.
