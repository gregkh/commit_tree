printk: Never set console_may_schedule in console_trylock()

This patch, basically, reverts commit 6b97a20d3a79 ("printk:
set may_schedule for some of console_trylock() callers").
That commit was a mistake, it introduced a big dependency
on the scheduler, by enabling preemption under console_sem
in printk()->console_unlock() path, which is rather too
critical. The patch did not significantly reduce the
possibilities of printk() lockups, but made it possible to
stall printk(), as has been reported by Tetsuo Handa [1].

Another issues is that preemption under console_sem also
messes up with Steven Rostedt's hand off scheme, by making
it possible to sleep with console_sem both in console_unlock()
and in vprintk_emit(), after acquiring the console_sem
ownership (anywhere between printk_safe_exit_irqrestore() in
console_trylock_spinning() and printk_safe_enter_irqsave()
in console_unlock()). This makes hand off less likely and,
at the same time, may result in a significant amount of
pending logbuf messages. Preempted console_sem owner makes
it impossible for other CPUs to emit logbuf messages, but
does not make it impossible for other CPUs to append new
messages to the logbuf.

Reinstate the old behavior and make printk() non-preemptible.
Should any printk() lockup reports arrive they must be handled
in a different way.
