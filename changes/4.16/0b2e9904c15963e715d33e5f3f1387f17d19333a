KVM: x86: move LAPIC initialization after VMCS creation

The initial reset of the local APIC is performed before the VMCS has been
created, but it tries to do a vmwrite:

 vmwrite error: reg 810 value 4a00 (err 18944)
 CPU: 54 PID: 38652 Comm: qemu-kvm Tainted: G        W I      4.16.0-0.rc2.git0.1.fc28.x86_64 #1

Move it later, after the VMCS has been created.
