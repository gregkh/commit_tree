tools: bpftool: remove new lines from errors

It's a little bit unusual for kernel style, but we add the new line
character to error strings inside the p_err() function.  We do this
because new lines at the end of error strings will break JSON output.

Fix a few p_err("..\n") which snuck in recently.
