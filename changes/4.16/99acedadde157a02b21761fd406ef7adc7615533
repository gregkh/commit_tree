HID: wacom: Properly handle AES serial number and tool type

Current AES sensors relay tool type and serial number information with
a different set of usages than those prescribed by the modern (i.e.
MobileStudio Pro and newer) EMR tablet standard. To ensure the driver
properly understands these usages, we modify them to be compatible.
The identifying information is split across three consecutive fields:
a 16-bit WACOM_HID_WT_SERIALNUMBER (which is more accurately described
as WACOM_HID_WD_TOOLTYPE), a 32-bit HID_DG_TOOLSERIALNUMBER, and an
8-bit 0xFF000000 (which should be WACOM_HID_WD_SERIALHI). While we're
at it, we also define proper min/max values since may may be undefined
on some devices.
