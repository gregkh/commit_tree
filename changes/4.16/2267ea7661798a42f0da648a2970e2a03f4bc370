KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't use existing "prodded" flag for XIVE escalations

The prodded flag is only cleared at the beginning of H_CEDE,
so every time we have an escalation, we will cause the *next*
H_CEDE to return immediately.

Instead use a dedicated "irq_pending" flag to indicate that
a guest interrupt is pending for the VCPU. We don't reuse the
existing exception bitmap so as to avoid expensive atomic ops.
