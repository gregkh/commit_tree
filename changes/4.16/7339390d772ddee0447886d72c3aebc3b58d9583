powerpc/pseries: Don't give a warning when HPT resizing isn't available

As of 438cc81a41 "powerpc/pseries: Automatically resize HPT for memory hot
add/remove" when running on the pseries platform, we always attempt to
use the PAPR extension to resize the hashed page table (HPT) when we add
or remove memory.

This is fine, but when the extension is available we'll give a harmless,
but scary warning.  This patch suppresses the warning in this case.  It
will still warn if the feature is supposed to be available, but didn't
work.
