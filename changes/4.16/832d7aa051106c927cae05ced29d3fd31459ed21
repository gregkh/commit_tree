mm: optimize dev_pagemap reference counting around get_dev_pagemap

Change the calling convention so that get_dev_pagemap always consumes the
previous reference instead of doing this using an explicit earlier call to
put_dev_pagemap in the callers.

The callers will still need to put the final reference after finishing the
loop over the pages.
