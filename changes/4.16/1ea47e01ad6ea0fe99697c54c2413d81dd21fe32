bpf: add support for bpf_call to interpreter

though bpf_call is still the same call instruction and
calling convention 'bpf to bpf' and 'bpf to helper' is the same
the interpreter has to oparate on 'struct bpf_insn *'.
To distinguish these two cases add a kernel internal opcode and
mark call insns with it.
This opcode is seen by interpreter only. JITs will never see it.
Also add tiny bit of debug code to aid interpreter debugging.
