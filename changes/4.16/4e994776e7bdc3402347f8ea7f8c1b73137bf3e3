ip_tunnel: Do not use mark in skb by default

This reverts commit 5c38bd1b82e1f76f9fa96c1e61c9897cabf1ce45.

skb->mark contains the mark the encapsulated traffic which
can result in incorrect routing decisions being made such
as routing loops if the route chosen is via tunnel itself.
The correct method should be to use tunnel->fwmark.
