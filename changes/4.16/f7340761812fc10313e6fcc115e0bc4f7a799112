pipe: read buffer limits atomically

The pipe buffer limits are accessed without any locking, and may be
changed at any time by the sysctl handlers.  In theory this could cause
problems for expressions like the following:

    pipe_user_pages_hard && user_bufs > pipe_user_pages_hard

...  since the assembly code might reference the 'pipe_user_pages_hard'
memory location multiple times, and if the admin removes the limit by
setting it to 0, there is a very brief window where processes could
incorrectly observe the limit to be exceeded.

Fix this by loading the limits with READ_ONCE() prior to use.
