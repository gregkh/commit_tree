bpf: introduce function calls (function boundaries)

Allow arbitrary function calls from bpf function to another bpf function.

Since the beginning of bpf all bpf programs were represented as a single function
and program authors were forced to use always_inline for all functions
in their C code. That was causing llvm to unnecessary inflate the code size
and forcing developers to move code to header files with little code reuse.

With a bit of additional complexity teach verifier to recognize
arbitrary function calls from one bpf function to another as long as
all of functions are presented to the verifier as a single bpf program.
New program layout:
r6 = r1    // some code
..
r1 = ..    // arg1
r2 = ..    // arg2
call pc+1  // function call pc-relative
exit
.. = r1    // access arg1
.. = r2    // access arg2
..
call pc+20 // second level of function call
...

It allows for better optimized code and finally allows to introduce
the core bpf libraries that can be reused in different projects,
since programs are no longer limited by single elf file.
With function calls bpf can be compiled into multiple .o files.

This patch is the first step. It detects programs that contain
multiple functions and checks that calls between them are valid.
It splits the sequence of bpf instructions (one program) into a set
of bpf functions that call each other. Calls to only known
functions are allowed. In the future the verifier may allow
calls to unresolved functions and will do dynamic linking.
This logic supports statically linked bpf functions only.

Such function boundary detection could have been done as part of
control flow graph building in check_cfg(), but it's cleaner to
separate function boundary detection vs control flow checks within
a subprogram (function) into logically indepedent steps.
Follow up patches may split check_cfg() further, but not check_subprogs().

Only allow bpf-to-bpf calls for root only and for non-hw-offloaded programs.
These restrictions can be relaxed in the future.
