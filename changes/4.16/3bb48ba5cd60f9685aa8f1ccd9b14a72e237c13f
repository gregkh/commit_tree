tee: optee: add page list manipulation functions

These functions will be used to pass information about shared
buffers to OP-TEE. ABI between Linux and OP-TEE is defined
in optee_msg.h and optee_smc.h.

optee_msg.h defines OPTEE_MSG_ATTR_NONCONTIG attribute
for shared memory references and describes how such references
should be passed. Note that it uses 64-bit page addresses even
on 32 bit systems. This is done to support LPAE and to unify
interface.
