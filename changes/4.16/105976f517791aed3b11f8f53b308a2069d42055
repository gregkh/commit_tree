blk-mq: don't call io sched's .requeue_request when requeueing rq to ->dispatch

__blk_mq_requeue_request() covers two cases:

- one is that the requeued request is added to hctx->dispatch, such as
blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list()

- another case is that the request is requeued to io scheduler, such as
blk_mq_requeue_request().

We should call io sched's .requeue_request callback only for the 2nd
case.
