net/sched: fix idr leak in the error path of __tcf_ipt_init()

__tcf_ipt_init() can fail after the idr has been successfully reserved.
When this happens, subsequent attempts to configure xt/ipt rules using
the same idr value systematically fail with -ENOSPC:

 # tc action add action xt -j LOG --log-prefix test1 index 100
 tablename: mangle hook: NF_IP_POST_ROUTING
         target:  LOG level warning prefix "test1" index 100
 RTNETLINK answers: Cannot allocate memory
 We have an error talking to the kernel
 Command "(null)" is unknown, try "tc actions help".
 # tc action add action xt -j LOG --log-prefix test1 index 100
 tablename: mangle hook: NF_IP_POST_ROUTING
         target:  LOG level warning prefix "test1" index 100
 RTNETLINK answers: No space left on device

Fix this in the error path of __tcf_ipt_init(), calling tcf_idr_release()
in place of tcf_idr_cleanup(). Since tcf_ipt_release() can now be called
when tcfi_t is NULL, we also need to protect calls to ipt_destroy_target()
to avoid NULL pointer dereference.
