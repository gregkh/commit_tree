drm/i915: Disable all planes for load detection, v2.

We don't need any active planes during load detection, so just disable
them all. This saves us from having to come up with a suitable
framebuffer. And we also avoid leaving sprite/cursor planes on and
potentially presenting them at a peculiar location during the load
detection.

Changes since v1 (Maarten):
- Add missing call to add_all_affected_planes.
