slimbus: qcom: Add runtime-pm support using clock-pause

Slimbus HW mandates that clock-pause sequence has to be executed
before disabling relevant interface and core clocks.
Runtime-PM's autosuspend feature is used here to enter/exit low
power mode for Qualcomm's Slimbus controller. Autosuspend feature
enables driver to avoid changing power-modes too frequently since
entering clock-pause is an expensive sequence
