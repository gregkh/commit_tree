interface files, device initialization flows, FW interaction flows, and
debug collection flows.
Modify Ethernet driver (qede) to make use of new FW in fastpath.
Modify RoCE/iWARP driver (qedr) to make use of new FW in fastpath.
Modify FCoE driver (qedf) to make use of new FW in fastpath.
Modify iSCSI driver (qedi) to make use of new FW in fastpath.
