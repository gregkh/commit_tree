iio: common: ssp_sensors: use ktime_get_real_ns() timestamps

getnstimeofday() suffers from the overflow in y2038 on 32-bit
architectures and requires a conversion into the nanosecond format that
we want here.

This changes ssp_parse_dataframe() to use ktime_get_real_ns() directly,
which does not have that problem.

An open question is what time base should be used here. Normally
timestamps should use ktime_get_ns() or ktime_get_boot_ns() to read
monotonic time instead of "real" time, which suffers from time jumps
due to settimeofday() calls or leap seconds.
