ovl: encode non-indexed upper file handles

We only need to encode origin if there is a chance that the same object was
encoded pre copy up and then we need to stay consistent with the same
encoding also after copy up.

In case a non-pure upper is not indexed, then it was copied up before NFS
export support was enabled. In that case, we don't need to worry about
staying consistent with pre copy up encoding and we encode an upper file
handle.

This mitigates the problem that with no index, we cannot find an upper
inode from origin inode, so we cannot decode a non-indexed upper from
origin file handle.
