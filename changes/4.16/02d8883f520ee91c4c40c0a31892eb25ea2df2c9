RDMA/restrack: Add general infrastructure to track RDMA resources

The RDMA subsystem has very strict set of objects to work with, but it
completely lacks tracking facilities and has no visibility of resource
utilization.

The following patch adds such infrastructure to keep track of RDMA
resources to help with debugging of user space applications. The primary
user of this infrastructure is RDMA nldev netlink (following patches), to
be exposed to userspace via rdmatool, but it is not limited too that.

At this stage, the main three objects (PD, CQ and QP) are added, and more
will be added later.
