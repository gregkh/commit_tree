net_sched: implement ->change_tx_queue_len() for pfifo_fast

pfifo_fast used to drop based on qdisc_dev(qdisc)->tx_queue_len,
so we have to resize skb array when we change tx_queue_len.

Other qdiscs which read tx_queue_len are fine because they
all save it to sch->limit or somewhere else in qdisc during init.
They don't have to implement this, it is nicer if they do so
that users don't have to re-configure qdisc after changing
tx_queue_len.
