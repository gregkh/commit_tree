usb: core: add support for USB_REQ_SET_ISOCH_DELAY

USB SS and SSP hubs provide wHubDelay values on their hub descriptor
which we should inform the USB Device about.

The USB Specification 3.0 explains, on section 9.4.11, how to
calculate the value and how to issue the request. Note that a
USB_REQ_SET_ISOCH_DELAY is valid on all device states (Default,
Address, Configured), we just *chose* to issue it from Address state
right after successfully fetching the USB Device Descriptor.
