USB: clarify USB_DT_USB_SSP_CAP_SIZE(ssac) definition

USB_DT_USB_SSP_CAP_SIZE(ssac) gives the size of the SSP capability
descriptor. The descriptor consists of 12 bytes plus a array of
SSA entries.

The number of SSA entries is stored in a SSAC value in the first 12 bytes,
The USB3.1 specification 9.6.2.5 defines SSAC as zero based:
"The number of Sublink Speed Attributes = SSAC + 1." This is not
intuitive and has already caused some confusion.

Make a small modifiaction to the USB_DT_USB_SSP_CAP_SIZE(ssac)
definition to make it a bit clearer
