drm/i915/selftests: Wake the device before executing requests on the GPU

To execute a requests requires us to have first woken the device, using
the rpm wakeref (as the request needs to write to hardware to setup the
context/ppGTT and execute on the GPU). So call intel_runtime_pm_get()
around queuing the request; the request itself will then carry a wakeref
until completion.
