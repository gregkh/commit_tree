ath10k: Add support for htt_data_tx_desc_64 descriptor

WCN3990 target uses 64 bit frags_paddr in htt tx descriptor,
which holds the physical address of SKB fragments in tx data path.

In order to support 64 bit bit frags_paddr in htt tx descriptor, define
htt_data_tx_desc_64 descriptor and ath10k_htt_tx_64 method for handling
tx data path with new descriptor fields.
