xprtrdma: Per-mode handling for Remote Invalidation

Refactoring change: Remote Invalidation is particular to the memory
registration mode that is use. Use a callout instead of a generic
function to handle Remote Invalidation.

This gets rid of the 8-byte flags field in struct rpcrdma_mw, of
which only a single bit flag has been allocated.
