HID: multitouch: Only look at non touch fields in first packet of a frame

Devices in "single finger hybrid mode" will send one report per finger,
on some devices only the first report of such a multi-packet frame will
contain a value for BTN_LEFT, in subsequent reports (if multiple fingers
are down) the value is always 0, causing hid-mt to report BTN_LEFT going
1 - 0 - 1 - 0 when pressing a clickpad and putting down a second finger.
This happens for example on USB 0603:0002 mt touchpads.

This commit fixes this by only reporting non touch fields for the first
packet of a (possibly) multi-packet frame.
