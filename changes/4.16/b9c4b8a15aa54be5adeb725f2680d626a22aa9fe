staging: lustre: lnet: selftest: don't allocate small strings.

All of the "name" buffers here are at most LST_NAME_SIZE+1
bytes, so 33 bytes at most.
They are only used temporarily during the life of the function
that allocates them.
So it is much simpler to just allocate on the stack.
Worst case is lst_tet_add_ioct(), which allocates
3 for these which 99 bytes on the stack, instead of the 24 that would
have been allocated for 64-bit pointers.
