virtio-net: disable NAPI only when enabled during XDP set

We try to disable NAPI to prevent a single XDP TX queue being used by
multiple cpus. But we don't check if device is up (NAPI is enabled),
this could result stall because of infinite wait in
napi_disable(). Fixing this by checking device state through
netif_running() before.
