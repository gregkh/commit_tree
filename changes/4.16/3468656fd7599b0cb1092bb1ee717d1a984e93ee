ibmvnic: Fix rx queue cleanup for non-fatal resets

At some point, a check was added to exit the polling routine during resets.
This makes sense for most reset conditions, but for a non-fatal error, we
expect the polling routine to continue running to properly clean up the rx
queues. This patch checks if we are performing a non-fatal reset and if we
are, continues normal polling operation.
