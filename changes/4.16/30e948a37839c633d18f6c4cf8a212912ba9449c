ipv4: Get the address of interface correctly.

When using ioctl to get address of interface, we can't
get it anymore. For example, the command is show as below.

	# ifconfig eth0

In the patch ("03aef17bb79b3"), the devinet_ioctl does not
return a suitable value, even though we can find it in
the kernel. Then fix it now.

Fixes: 03aef17bb79b3 ("devinet_ioctl(): take copyin/copyout to caller")
