drivers: base: add coredump driver ops

This adds the coredump driver operation. When the driver defines it
a coredump file is added in the sysfs folder of the device upon
driver binding. The file is removed when the driver is unbound.
User-space can trigger a coredump for this device by echo'ing to
the coredump file.
