r8152: set rx mode early when linking on

Set rx mode before calling netif_wake_queue() when linking on to avoid
the device missing the receiving packets.

The transmission may start after calling netif_wake_queue(), and the
packets of resopnse may reach before calling rtl8152_set_rx_mode()
which let the device could receive packets. Then, the packets of
response would be missed.
