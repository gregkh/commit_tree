clk: rework calls to round and determine rate callbacks

Rework the way the callbacks round_rate() and determine_rate() are called.
The goal is to do this at a single point and make it easier to add
conditions before calling them.

Because of this factorization, rate returned by determine_rate() is also
checked against the min and max rate values

This rework is done to ease the integration of "protected" clock
functionality.
