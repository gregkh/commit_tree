RDMA/core: Clarify rdma_ah_find_type

iWARP does not use rdma_ah_attr_type, and for this reason we do not have a
RDMA_AH_ATTR_TYPE_IWARP. rdma_ah_find_type should not even be called on iwarp
ports and for clarity it shouldn't have a special test for iWarp.

This changes the result from RDMA_AH_ATTR_TYPE_ROCE to RDMA_AH_ATTR_TYPE_IB
when wrongly called on an iWarp port.
