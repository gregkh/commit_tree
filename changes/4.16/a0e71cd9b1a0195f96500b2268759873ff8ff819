of: Add helper for mapping device node to logical CPU number

Add a helper to map a device node to a logical CPU number to avoid
duplication. Currently this is open coded in different places (e.g
gic-v3, coresight). The helper tries to map device node to a "possible"
logical CPU id, which may not be online yet. It is the responsibility
of the user to make sure that the CPU is online. The helper uses
of_cpu_device_node_get() to retrieve the device node for a given CPU
(which uses per_cpu data if available else falls back to slower
of_get_cpu_node()).
