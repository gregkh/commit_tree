Coccinelle: kzalloc-simple: Add all zero allocating functions

There are many instances where memory is allocated using regular
allocator functions immediately followed by setting the allocated
memory to 0 value using memset.

We already have zero memory allocator functions to set the memory to
0 value instead of manually setting it using memset.

Therefore, use zero memory allocating functions instead of regular
memory allocators followed by memset 0 to remove redundant memset and
make the code more cleaner and also reduce the code size.
