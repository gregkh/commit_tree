scsi: bnx2fc: Fix check in SCSI completion handler for timed out request

When a request times out we set the io_req flag BNX2FC_FLAG_IO_COMPL so
that if a subsequent completion comes in on that task ID we will ignore
it.  The issue is that in the check for this flag there is a missing
return so we will continue to process a request which may have already
been returned to the ownership of the SCSI layer.  This can cause
unpredictable results.

Solution is to add in the missing return.
