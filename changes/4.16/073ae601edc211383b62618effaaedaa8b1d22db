perf annotate: Add symbol__calc_percent function

Add symbol__calc_percent function, that calculates annotation data for
symbol and put the data in the struct annotation_line::samples array.

Committer notes:

Made symbol__calc_percent non static to be used in the next two patches,
which will get some fixups from jolsa, doing it this way to keep this
bisectable.
