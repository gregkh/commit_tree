sh_eth: get Ether port # only when needed

The dual-port Ether configurations always have a shared TSU to e.g. pass
the packets between those  ports.  With the  TSU init. code gathered under
the single *if*, we now can only get the port # from 'platform_device::id'
only when we actually  need it  (and not recalculate it each time)...
