MIPS: CPS: Fix MIPS_ISA_LEVEL_RAW fallout

Commit 17278a91e04f ("MIPS: CPS: Fix r1 .set mt assembler warning")
added .set MIPS_ISA_LEVEL_RAW to silence warnings about .set mt on r1,
however this can result in a MOVE being encoded as a 64-bit DADDU
instruction on certain version of binutils (e.g. 2.22), and reserved
instruction exceptions at runtime on 32-bit hardware.

Reduce the sizes of the push/pop sections to include only instructions
that are part of the MT ASE or which won't convert to 64-bit
instructions after .set mips64r2/mips64r6.
