    drm/prime: proper locking+refcounting for obj->dma_buf link

obj->dma_buf link should be reinstated at import time.

Gvt-g dma-buf buffer exposeing might be simpler, as there won't be much
racing during Gvt-g dma-buf exposing. In other words, Gvt-g dma-buf
exposing can guarantee exposing happens before gem close ioctl, and Gvt-g
is the only exporter of the guest framebuffer.

But following the drm prime scheme can give Gvt-g a chance to increase a
dma-buf reference count during importing. Otherwise, we have to increase
the reference during exposing, which will break the case that the only
reference userspace has held was through the dma-buf fd and the reference
count is one.
