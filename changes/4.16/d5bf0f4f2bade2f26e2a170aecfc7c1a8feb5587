iommu/amd: Deprecate pci_get_bus_and_slot()

pci_get_bus_and_slot() is restrictive such that it assumes domain=0 as
where a PCI device is present. This restricts the device drivers to be
reused for other domain numbers.

Getting ready to remove pci_get_bus_and_slot() function in favor of
pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot().

Hard-code the domain number as 0 for the AMD IOMMU driver.
