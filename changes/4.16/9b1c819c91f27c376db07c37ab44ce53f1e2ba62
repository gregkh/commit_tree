ARM: dts: imx53-m53: Remove unneeded reg property

As described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/touchscreen/stmpe.txt
there is no 'reg' property under stmpe_touchscreen, so remove it
to fix the following build warning with W=1:

arch/arm/boot/dts/imx53-m53evk.dtb: Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /soc/aips@60000000/i2c@63fc4000/stmpe610@41/stmpe_touchscreen has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name
