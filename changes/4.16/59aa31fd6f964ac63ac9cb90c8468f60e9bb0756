powerpc: introduce pte_set_hidx() helper

Introduce pte_set_hidx().It sets the (H_PAGE_F_SECOND|H_PAGE_F_GIX) bits
at the appropriate location in the PTE of 4K PTE. For 64K PTE, it sets
the bits in the second part of the PTE. Though the implementation for
the former just needs the slot parameter, it does take some additional
parameters to keep the prototype consistent.

This function will be handy as we work towards re-arranging the bits in
the subsequent patches.
