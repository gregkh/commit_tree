test_bpf: reduce MAX_TESTRUNS

For tests that are using the maximal number of BPF instruction, each
run takes 20 usec. Looping 10,000 times on them totals 200 ms, which
is bad when the loop is not preemptible.

test_bpf: #264 BPF_MAXINSNS: Call heavy transformations jited:1 19248
18548 PASS
test_bpf: #269 BPF_MAXINSNS: ld_abs+get_processor_id jited:1 20896 PASS

Lets divide by ten the number of iterations, so that max latency is
20ms. We could use need_resched() to break the loop earlier if we
believe 20 ms is too much.
