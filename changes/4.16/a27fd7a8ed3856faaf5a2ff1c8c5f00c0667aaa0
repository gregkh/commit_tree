tcp: purge write queue upon RST

When the connection is reset, there is no point in
keeping the packets on the write queue until the connection
is closed.

RFC 793 (page 70) and RFC 793-bis (page 64) both suggest
purging the write queue upon RST:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis-07

Moreover, this is essential for a correct MSG_ZEROCOPY
implementation, because userspace cannot call close(fd)
before receiving zerocopy signals even when the connection
is reset.
