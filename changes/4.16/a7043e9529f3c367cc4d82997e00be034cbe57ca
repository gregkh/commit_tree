scsi: mptfusion: Add bounds check in mptctl_hp_targetinfo()

My static checker complains about an out of bounds read:

    drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c:2786 mptctl_hp_targetinfo()
    error: buffer overflow 'hd->sel_timeout' 255 <= u32max.

It's true that we probably should have a bounds check here.
