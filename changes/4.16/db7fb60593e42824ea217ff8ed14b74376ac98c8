drm/i915: Check if the stolen memory "reserved" area is enabled or not

Apparently there are some machines that put semi-sensible looking values
into the stolen "reserved" base and size, except those values are actually
outside the stolen memory. There is a bit in the register which
supposedly could tell us whether the reserved area is even enabled or
not. Let's check for that before we go trusting the base and size.
