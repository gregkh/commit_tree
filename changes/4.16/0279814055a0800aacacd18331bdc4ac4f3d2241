net: sched: cls_matchall: propagate extack support for filter offload

Propagate the extack pointer from the `->change()` classifier operation
to the function used for filter replacement in cls_matchall. This makes
it possible to use netlink extack messages in the future at replacement
time for this filter, although it is not used at this point.
