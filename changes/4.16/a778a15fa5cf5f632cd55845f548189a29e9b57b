netfilter: ipset: add resched points during set listing

When sets are extremely large we can get softlockup during ipset -L.
We could fix this by adding cond_resched_rcu() at the right location
during iteration, but this only works if RCU nesting depth is 1.

At this time entire variant->list() is called under under rcu_read_lock_bh.
This used to be a read_lock_bh() but as rcu doesn't really lock anything,
it does not appear to be needed, so remove it (ipset increments set
reference count before this, so a set deletion should not be possible).
