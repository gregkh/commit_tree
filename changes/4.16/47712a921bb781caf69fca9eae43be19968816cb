powerpc/watchdog: remove arch_trigger_cpumask_backtrace

The powerpc NMI IPIs may not be recoverable if they are taken in
some sections of code, and also there have been and still are issues
with taking NMIs (in KVM guest code, in firmware, etc) which makes them
a bit dangerous to use.

Generic code like softlockup detector and rcu stall detectors really
hammer on trigger_*_backtrace, which has lead to further problems
because we've implemented it with the NMI.

So stop providing NMI backtraces for now. Importantly, the powerpc code
uses NMI IPIs in crash/debug, and the SMP hardlockup watchdog. So if the
softlockup and rcu hang detection traces are not being printed because
the CPU is stuck with interrupts off, then the hard lockup watchdog
should get it with the NMI IPI.
