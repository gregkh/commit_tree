pseries/drc-info: Search DRC properties for CPU indexes

pseries/drc-info: Provide parallel routines to convert between
drc_index and CPU numbers at runtime, using the older device-tree
properties ("ibm,drc-indexes", "ibm,drc-names", "ibm,drc-types"
and "ibm,drc-power-domains"), or the new property "ibm,drc-info".
