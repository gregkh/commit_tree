media: intel-ipu3: Rename arr_size macro, use min

The arr_size() macro which is used to calculate the size of the chunk in the
array to be arranged resembles ARRAY_SIZE naming-wise. Avoid confusion by
renaming it to CHUNK_SIZE instead.

Also use min() macro to calculate the minimum of two numbers.
