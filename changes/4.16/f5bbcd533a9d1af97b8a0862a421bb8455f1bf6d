arm64: dts: renesas: salvator-common: Add EthernetAVB PHY reset

Describe the GPIO used to reset the Ethernet PHY for EthernetAVB.
This allows the driver to reset the PHY during probe and after system
resume.

This fixes Ethernet operation after resume from s2ram on Salvator-XS,
where the enable pin of the regulator providing PHY power is connected
to PRESETn, and PSCI powers down the SoC during system suspend.

On Salvator-X, the enable pin is always pulled high, but the driver may
still need to reset the PHY if this wasn't done by the bootloader
before.

Inspired by patches in the BSP for the individual Salvator-X/XS boards
by Kazuya Mizuguchi.
