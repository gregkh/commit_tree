netfilter: xt_RATEEST: acquire xt_rateest_mutex for hash insert

rateest_hash is supposed to be protected by xt_rateest_mutex,
and, as suggested by Eric, lookup and insert should be atomic,
so we should acquire the xt_rateest_mutex once for both.

So introduce a non-locking helper for internal use and keep the
locking one for external.
