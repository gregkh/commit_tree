serial: forbid 8250 on s390

Using "make kvmconfig" results in a potentially unusable linux image
on s390.  The reason is that both the (default on s390) sclp consoles
as well as the 8250 console register a ttyS<x> as console. Since there
will be no 8250 on s390 let's fence 8250. This will ensure that there
is always a working sclp console.
