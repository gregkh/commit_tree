perf trace: Remove audit-libs dependency if syscall tables are present

Change the Makefile and build process to no longer require audit-libs
interfaces when the architecture provides system call tables.

Committer notes:

Its not enough to hook into the NO_LIBAUDIT makefile block, we need to
define a CONFIG_TRACE that gets selected by both architectures
generating the syscall tables from the kernel headers and from detecting
the availability of libaudit.

With that in place we will not link against libaudit even if the
necessary files are available for that, in fact we will not even try to
detect its availability, speeding up a bit the feature detection phase.
