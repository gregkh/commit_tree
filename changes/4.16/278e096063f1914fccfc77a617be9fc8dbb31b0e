nvme_fcloop: fix abort race condition

A test case revealed a race condition of an i/o completing on a thread
parallel to the delete_association generating the aborts for the
outstanding ios on the controller.  The i/o completion was freeing the
target fcloop context, thus the abort task referenced the just-freed
memory.

Correct by clearing the target/initiator cross pointers in the io
completion and abort tasks before calling the callbacks. On aborts
that detect already finished io's, ensure the complete context is
called.
