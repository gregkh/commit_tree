locking/atomic/bitops: Document and clarify ordering semantics for failed test_and_{}_bit()

A test_and_{}_bit() operation fails if the value of the bit is such that
the modification does not take place. For example, if test_and_set_bit()
returns 1. In these cases, follow the behaviour of cmpxchg and allow the
operation to be unordered. This also applies to test_and_set_bit_lock()
if the lock is found to be be taken already.
