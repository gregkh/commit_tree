ARM: dts: LogicPD Torpedo: Fix I2C1 pinmux

The pinmuxing was missing for I2C1 which was causing intermittent issues
with the PMIC which is connected to I2C1.  The bootloader did not quite
configure the I2C1 either, so when running at 2.6MHz, it was generating
errors at time.

This correctly sets the I2C1 pinmuxing so it can operate at 2.6MHz
