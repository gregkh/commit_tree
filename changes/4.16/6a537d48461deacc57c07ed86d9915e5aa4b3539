gpio: of: Support regulator nonstandard GPIO properties

Before it was clearly established that all GPIO properties in the
device tree shall be named "foo-gpios" (with the deprecated variant
"foo-gpio" for single lines) we unfortunately merged a few bindings
for regulators with random phandle names.

As we want to switch the GPIO regulator driver to using descriptors,
we need devm_gpiod_get() to return something reasonable when looking
up these in the device tree.

Put in a special #ifdef:ed kludge to do this special lookup only
for the regulator case and gets compiled out if we're not enabling
regulators. Supply a whitelist with properties we accept.
