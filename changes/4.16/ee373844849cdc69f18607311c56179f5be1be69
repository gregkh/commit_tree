rtlwifi: btcoex: add scan_notify within ips_notify if RFON

Three steps of connection procedure are scan, enter/leave IPS, auth.
There is no scan between leaving IPS and sending auth, but btcoex use scan
as an important clue that indicates user is going to connect. So add scan
notifications in ips_notify to correct btcoex's state.
