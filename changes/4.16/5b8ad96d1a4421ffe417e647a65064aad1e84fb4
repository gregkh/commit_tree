fixdep: remove some false CONFIG_ matches

The string CONFIG_ quite often appears after other alphanumerics,
meaning that that instance cannot be referencing a Kconfig
symbol. Omitting these means make has fewer files to stat() when
deciding what needs to be rebuilt - for a defconfig build, this seems to
remove about 2% of the (wildcard ...) lines from the .o.cmd files.
