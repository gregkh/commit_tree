IB/ipoib: Do not warn if IPoIB debugfs doesn't exist

netdev_wait_allrefs() could rebroadcast NETDEV_UNREGISTER event
multiple times until all refs are gone, which will result in calling
ipoib_delete_debug_files multiple times and printing a warning.

Remove the WARN_ONCE since checks of NULL pointers before calling
debugfs_remove are not needed.
