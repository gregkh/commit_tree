xprtrdma: buf_free not called for CB replies

Since commit 5a6d1db45569 ("SUNRPC: Add a transport-specific private
field in rpc_rqst"), the rpc_rqst's for RPC-over-RDMA backchannel
operations leave rq_buffer set to NULL.

xprt_release does not invoke ->op->buf_free when rq_buffer is NULL.
The RPCRDMA_REQ_F_BACKCHANNEL check in xprt_rdma_free is therefore
redundant because xprt_rdma_free is not invoked for backchannel
requests.
