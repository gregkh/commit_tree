team: Fix double free in error path

The __send_and_alloc_skb() receives a skb ptr as a parameter but in
case it fails the skb is not valid:
- Send failed and released the skb internally.
- Allocation failed.

The current code tries to release the skb in case of failure which
causes redundant freeing.
