blk-merge: compute bio->bi_seg_front_size efficiently

It is enough to check and compute bio->bi_seg_front_size just
after the 1st segment is found, but current code checks that
for each bvec, which is inefficient.

This patch follows the way in  __blk_recalc_rq_segments()
for computing bio->bi_seg_front_size, and it is more efficient
and code becomes more readable too.
