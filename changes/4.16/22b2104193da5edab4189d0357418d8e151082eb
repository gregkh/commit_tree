iwlwifi: mvm: force quota update upon NoA setting

The way p2p NoA is forced in SCM (used for WFA tests)
is by setting a quota < 100% (simulating DCM).
A test-mode command is used for setting the NoA params.
In that case, force quota update or nothing will happen
if there was no significant change in the quota
at that exact point (which is likely to be the case).
