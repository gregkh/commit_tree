ARM: dts: exynos: Use lower case hex addresses in node unit addresses

Convert all hex addresses in node unit addresses to lower case to fix warnings
like:
    arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos5422-odroidhc1.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg):
      Node /soc/nocp@10CA1000 simple-bus unit address format error, expected "10ca1000"

Conversion was done using sed:

    $ sed -e 's/@\([a-zA-Z0-9_-]*\) {/@\L\1 {/' -i arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos*.dts*
