clk: add clk_rate_exclusive api

Using clock rate protection, we can now provide a way for clock consumer
to claim exclusive control over the rate of a producer

So far, rate change operations have been a "last write wins" affair. This
changes allows drivers to explicitly protect against this behavior, if
required.

Of course, if exclusivity over a producer is claimed more than once, the
rate is effectively locked as exclusivity cannot be preempted
