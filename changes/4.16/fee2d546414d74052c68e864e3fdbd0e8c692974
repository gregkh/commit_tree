net: phy: marvell: mv88e6390 temperature sensor reading

The internal PHYs in the mv88e6390 switch have a temperature sensor.
It uses a different register layout to other PHY currently supported.
It also has an errata, in that some reads of the sensor result in bad
values. So a number of reads need to be made, and the average taken.
