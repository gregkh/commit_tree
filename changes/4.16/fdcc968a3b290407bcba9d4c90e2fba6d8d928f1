ALSA: hda/realtek: PCI quirk for Fujitsu U7x7

These laptops have a combined jack to attach headsets, the U727 on
the left, the U757 on the right, but a headsets microphone doesn't
work. Using hdajacksensetest I found that pin 0x19 changed the
present state when plugging the headset, in addition to 0x21, but
didn't have the correct configuration (shown as "Not connected").

So this sets the configuration to the same values as the headphone
pin 0x21 except for the device type microphone, which makes it
work correctly. With the patch the configured pins for U727 are

Pin 0x12 (Internal Mic, Mobile-In): present = No
Pin 0x14 (Internal Speaker): present = No
Pin 0x19 (Black Mic, Left side): present = No
Pin 0x1d (Internal Aux): present = No
Pin 0x21 (Black Headphone, Left side): present = No
