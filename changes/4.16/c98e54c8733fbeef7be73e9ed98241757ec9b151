alpha/PCI: Deprecate pci_get_bus_and_slot()

pci_get_bus_and_slot() is restrictive such that it assumes domain=0 as
where a PCI device is present. This restricts the device drivers to be
reused for other domain numbers.

Use pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() with a domain number of 0 where we can't
extract the domain number. Other places, use the actual domain number from
the device.
