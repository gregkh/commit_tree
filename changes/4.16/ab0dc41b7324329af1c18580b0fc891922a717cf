riscv: Remove ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB select

The ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB symbol was removed in commit 65053e1a7743
("gpio: delete ARCH_[WANTS_OPTIONAL|REQUIRE]_GPIOLIB"). GPIOLIB should
just be selected explicitly if needed.

Remove the ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB select from RISCV.

See commit 0145071b3314 ("x86: Do away with
ARCH_[WANT_OPTIONAL|REQUIRE]_GPIOLIB") and commit da9a1c6767 ("arm64: do
away with ARCH_[WANT_OPTIONAL|REQUIRE]_GPIOLIB") as well.

Discovered with the
https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/blob/master/examples/list_undefined.py
script.
