powerpc: System reset avoid interleaving oops using die synchronisation

The die() oops path contains a serializing lock to prevent oops
messages from being interleaved. In the case of a system reset
initiated oops (e.g., qemu nmi command), __die was being called
which lacks that synchronisation and oops reports could be
interleaved across CPUs.

A recent patch 4388c9b3a6ee7 ("powerpc: Do not send system reset
request through the oops path") changed this to __die to avoid
the debugger() call, but there is no real harm to calling it twice
if the first time fell through. So go back to using die() here.
This was observed to fix the problem.
