sctp: remove the old ttl expires policy

The prsctp polices include ttl expires policy already, we should remove
the old ttl expires codes, and just adjust the new polices' codes to be
compatible with the old one for users.

This patch is to remove all the old expires codes, and if prsctp polices
are not set, it will still set msg's expires_at and check the expires in
sctp_check_abandoned.

Note that asoc->prsctp_enable is set by default, so users can't feel any
difference even if they use the old expires api in userspace.
