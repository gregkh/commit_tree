spi: imx: use prepare_transfer_hardware() for lpspi

The old driver enable clk in fsl_lpspi_prepare_message() and
disable clk in fsl_lpspi_unprepare_message().

Rather than doing this per message it's a bit better to do it
in prepare_transfer_hardware(), that way if there's a sequence
of messages queued one after another we don't turn the clock on
and off all the time.
