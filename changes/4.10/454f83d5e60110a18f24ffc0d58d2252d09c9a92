musb: sunxi: Force session end on babble errors in host-mode

The sunxi musb has a bug where sometimes it will generate a babble
error on device disconnect instead of a disconnect irq. When this
happens the musb-controller switches from host mode to device mode
(it clears MUSB_DEVCTL_SESSION and sets MUSB_DEVCTL_BDEVICE) and
gets stuck in this state.

Clearing this requires reporting Vbus low for 200 or more ms, but
on some devices Vbus is simply always high (host-only mode, no Vbus
control).

This commit adds a sunxi_musb_recover() callback which makes
sunxi_musb_work call phy_set_mode with the current mode, which
will force end the current session.

This fixes the musb controller getting stuck in this state on systems
without Vbus control; and also fixes the need to unplug the usb-b ->
usb-a cable to get out of this state on systems with Vbus control.
