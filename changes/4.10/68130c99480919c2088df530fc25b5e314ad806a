scsi: arcmsr: Use pci_alloc_irq_vectors

Switch the arcmsr driver to use pci_alloc_irq_vectors.  We need to two
calls to pci_alloc_irq_vectors as arcmsr only supports multiple MSI-X
vectors, but not multiple MSI vectors.

Otherwise this cleans up a lot of cruft and allows to use a common
request_irq loop for irq types, which happens to only iterate over a
single line in the non MSI-X case.
