vfio iommu: Added pin and unpin callback functions to vfio_iommu_driver_ops

Added APIs for pining and unpining set of pages. These call back into
backend iommu module to actually pin and unpin pages.
Added two new callback functions to struct vfio_iommu_driver_ops. Backend
IOMMU module that supports pining and unpinning pages for mdev devices
should provide these functions.

Renamed static functions in vfio_type1_iommu.c to resolve conflicts
