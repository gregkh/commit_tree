mlx4: xdp: Allow raising MTU up to one page minus eth and vlan hdrs

When XDP is active in mlx4, mlx4 is using one page/pkt.
At the same time (i.e. when XDP is active), it is currently
limiting MTU to be FRAG_SZ0 - ETH_HLEN - (2 * VLAN_HLEN)
which is 1514 in x86.  AFAICT, we can at least raise the MTU
limit up to PAGE_SIZE - ETH_HLEN - (2 * VLAN_HLEN) which this
patch is doing.  It will be useful in the next patch which
allows XDP program to extend the packet by adding new header(s).

Note: In the earlier XDP patches, there is already existing guard
to ensure the page/pkt scheme only applies when XDP is active
in mlx4.
