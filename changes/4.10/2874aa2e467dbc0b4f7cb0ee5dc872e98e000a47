bpf: Fix compilation warning in __bpf_lru_list_rotate_inactive

gcc-6.2.1 gives the following warning:
kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c: In function ‘__bpf_lru_list_rotate_inactive.isra.3’:
kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:201:28: warning: ‘next’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

The "next" is currently initialized in the while() loop which must have >=1
iterations.

This patch initializes next to get rid of the compiler warning.
