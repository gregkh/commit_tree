arm64: traps: simplify die() and __die()

In arm64's die and __die routines we pass around a thread_info, and
subsequently use this to determine the relevant task_struct, and the end
of the thread's stack. Subsequent patches will decouple thread_info from
the stack, and this approach will no longer work.

To figure out the end of the stack, we can use the new generic
end_of_stack() helper. As we only call __die() from die(), and die()
always deals with the current task, we can remove the parameter and have
both acquire current directly, which also makes it clear that __die
can't be called for arbitrary tasks.
