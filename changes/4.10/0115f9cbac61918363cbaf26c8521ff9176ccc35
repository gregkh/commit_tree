KVM: nVMX: generate non-true VMX MSRs based on true versions

The "non-true" VMX capability MSRs can be generated from their "true"
counterparts, by OR-ing the default1 bits. The default1 bits are fixed
and defined in the SDM.

Since we can generate the non-true VMX MSRs from the true versions,
there's no need to store both in struct nested_vmx. This also lets
userspace avoid having to restore the non-true MSRs.

Note this does not preclude emulating MSR_IA32_VMX_BASIC[55]=0. To do so,
we simply need to set all the default1 bits in the true MSRs (such that
the true MSRs and the generated non-true MSRs are equal).
