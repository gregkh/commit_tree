clk: qcom: Move all sdcc rcgs to use clk_rcg2_floor_ops

The sdcc driver for msm8996/msm8916/msm8974/msm8994 and apq8084
expects a clk_set_rate() on the sdcc rcg clk to set
a floor value of supported clk rate closest to the requested
rate, by looking up the frequency table.
So move all the sdcc rcgs on all these platforms to use the
newly introduced clk_rcg2_floor_ops
