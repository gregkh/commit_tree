net: ethernet: ti: cpts: calc mult and shift from refclk freq

The cyclecounter mult and shift values can be calculated based on the
CPTS rfclk frequency and timekeepnig framework provides required algos
and API's.

Hence, calc mult and shift basing on CPTS rfclk frequency if both
cpts_clock_shift and cpts_clock_mult properties are not provided in DT (the
basis of calculation algorithm is borrowed from
__clocksource_update_freq_scale() commit 7d2f944a2b83 ("clocksource:
Provide a generic mult/shift factor calculation")). After this change
cpts_clock_shift and cpts_clock_mult DT properties will become optional.
