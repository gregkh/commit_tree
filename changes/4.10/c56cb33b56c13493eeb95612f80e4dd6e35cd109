perf callchain: Fixup help/config for no-unwinding

Since 841e3558b2d ("perf callchain: Recording 'dwarf' callchains do not
need DWARF unwinding support"), --call-graph dwarf is allowed in 'perf
record' even without unwind support.  A couple of other places don't
reflect this yet though: the help text should list dwarf as a valid
record mode and the dump_size config should be respected too.
