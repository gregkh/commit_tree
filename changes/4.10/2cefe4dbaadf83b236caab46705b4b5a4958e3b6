block: add bio_iov_iter_get_pages()

This is a helper that pins down a range from an iov_iter and adds it to
a bio without requiring a separate memory allocation for the page array.
It will be used for upcoming direct I/O implementations for block devices
and iomap based file systems.

[hch: ported to the iov_iter interface, renamed and added comments.
      All blame should be directed to me and all fame should go to Kent
      after this!]
