drm/i915: Always convert incoming exec offsets to non-canonical

We're using non-canonical addresses in drm_mm, and we're making sure that
userspace is using canonical addressing - both in case of softpin
(verifying incoming offset) and when relocating (converting to canonical
when updating offset returned to userspace).
Unfortunately when considering the need for relocations, we're comparing
offset from userspace (in canonical form) with drm_mm node (in
non-canonical form), and as a result, we end up always relocating if our
offsets are in the "problematic" range.
Let's always convert the offsets to avoid the performance impact of
relocations.
