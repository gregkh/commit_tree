mfd: arizona: Use irq_find_mapping when appropriate

No need to use irq_create_mapping (although there is no issue with
doing so) when we are only looking up an existing mapping. Just to
streamline things a little and make the code a little more clear
change some calls from irq_create_mapping to irq_find_mapping.
