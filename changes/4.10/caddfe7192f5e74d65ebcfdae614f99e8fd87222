drm/i915: Defer breadcrumb emission

Move the actual emission of the breadcrumb for closing the request from
i915_add_request() to the submit callback. (It can be moved later when
required.) This allows us to defer the allocation of the global_seqno
from request construction to actual submission, allowing us to emit the
requests out of order (wrt to the order of their construction, they
still will only be executed one all of their dependencies are resolved
including that all earlier requests on their timeline have been
submitted.) We have to specialise how we then emit the request in order
to write into the preallocated space, rather than at the tail of the
ringbuffer (which will have been advanced by the addition of new
requests).
