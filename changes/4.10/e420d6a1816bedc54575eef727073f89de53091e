mfd: lpc_ich: Use gpio-ich driver for 8-series and 9-series Intel PCH devices

The Intel 8-series and 9-series PCH devices, described by the descriptors
LPC_LPT and LPC_9S although codenamed 'lynxpoint' do not use the same GPIO
register layout which is used by the gpio-lynxpoint driver.  They use the
same ICH_V5_GPIO layout as the gpio-ich driver.

http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/chipsets/9-series-chipset-pch-datasheet.html

The devices described by "Mobile 4th Generation Intel Core Processor
Family I/O" manual use the gpio-lynxpoint driver and are described by the
LPC_LPT_LP descriptor.
