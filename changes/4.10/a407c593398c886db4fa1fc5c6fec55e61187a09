scsi: libfc: Fixup disc_mutex handling

The list of attached 'rdata' remote port structures is RCU
protected, so there is no need to take the 'disc_mutex' when
traversing it.
Rather we should be using rcu_read_lock() and kref_get_unless_zero()
to validate the entries.
We need, however, take the disc_mutex when deleting an entry;
otherwise we risk clashes with list_add.
