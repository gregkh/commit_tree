mm: unexport __get_user_pages_unlocked()

Unexport the low-level __get_user_pages_unlocked() function and replaces
invocations with calls to more appropriate higher-level functions.

In hva_to_pfn_slow() we are able to replace __get_user_pages_unlocked()
with get_user_pages_unlocked() since we can now pass gup_flags.

In async_pf_execute() and process_vm_rw_single_vec() we need to pass
different tsk, mm arguments so get_user_pages_remote() is the sane
replacement in these cases (having added manual acquisition and release
of mmap_sem.)

Additionally get_user_pages_remote() reintroduces use of the FOLL_TOUCH
flag.  However, this flag was originally silently dropped by commit
1e9877902dc7 ("mm/gup: Introduce get_user_pages_remote()"), so this
appears to have been unintentional and reintroducing it is therefore not
an issue.
