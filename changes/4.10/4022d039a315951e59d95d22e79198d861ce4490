net: smmac: allow configuring lower pbl values

The driver currently always sets the PBLx8/PBLx4 bit, which means that
the pbl values configured via the pbl/txpbl/rxpbl DT properties are
always multiplied by 8/4 in the hardware.

In order to allow the DT to configure lower pbl values, while at the
same time not changing behavior of any existing device trees using the
pbl/txpbl/rxpbl settings, add a property to disable the multiplication
of the pbl by 8/4 in the hardware.
