ARM: dts: Add #pinctrl-cells for pinctrl-single instances

Drivers using pinctrl-single,pins have #pinctrl-cells = <1>, while
pinctrl-single,bits need #pinctrl-cells = <2>.

Note that this patch can be optionally applied separately from the
driver changes as the driver supports also the legacy binding without
#pinctrl-cells.
