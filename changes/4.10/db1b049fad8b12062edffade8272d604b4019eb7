spi: fsl-espi: extend and improve transfer error handling

Extend and improve transfer error handling
- in case of timeout report also number of remaining rx bytes
- in case of timeout return ETIMEDOUT instead of EMSGSIZE
- add sanity checks after all bytes have been sent / read:
 - check that HW has flag SPIE_DON set
 - check that RX / TX FIFO are empty
