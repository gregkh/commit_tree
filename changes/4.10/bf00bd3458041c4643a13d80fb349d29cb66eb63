mm, slab: maintain total slab count instead of active count

Rather than tracking the number of active slabs for each node, track the
total number of slabs.  This is a minor improvement that avoids active
slab tracking when a slab goes from free to partial or partial to free.

For slab debugging, this also removes an explicit free count since it
can easily be inferred by the difference in number of total objects and
number of active objects.
