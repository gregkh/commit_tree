lightnvm: remove gen_lun abstraction

The gen_lun abstraction in the generic media manager was conceived on
the assumption that a single target would instantiated on top of it.
This has complicated target design to implement multi-instances. Remove
this abstraction and move its logic to nvm_lun, which manages physical
lun geometry and operations.
