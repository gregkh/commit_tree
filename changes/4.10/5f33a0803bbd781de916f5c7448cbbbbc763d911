mm/vmscan.c: set correct defer count for shrinker

Our system uses significantly more slab memory with memcg enabled with
the latest kernel.  With 3.10 kernel, slab uses 2G memory, while with
4.6 kernel, 6G memory is used.  The shrinker has problem.  Let's see we
have two memcg for one shrinker.  In do_shrink_slab:

1. Check cg1.  nr_deferred = 0, assume total_scan = 700.  batch size
   is 1024, then no memory is freed.  nr_deferred = 700

2. Check cg2.  nr_deferred = 700.  Assume freeable = 20, then
   total_scan = 10 or 40.  Let's assume it's 10.  No memory is freed.
   nr_deferred = 10.

The deferred share of cg1 is lost in this case.  kswapd will free no
memory even run above steps again and again.

The fix makes sure one memcg's deferred share isn't lost.
