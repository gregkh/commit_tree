USB: Add quirk for WORLDE easykey.25 MIDI keyboard

Add a quirk for WORLDE easykey.25 MIDI keyboard (idVendor=0218,
idProduct=0401). The device reports that it has config string
descriptor at index 3, but when the system selects the configuration
and tries to get the description, it returns a -EPROTO error,
the communication restarts and this keeps repeating over and over again.
Not requesting the string descriptor makes the device work correctly.

Relevant info from Wireshark:
