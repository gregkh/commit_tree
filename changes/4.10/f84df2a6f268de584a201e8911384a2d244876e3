exec: Ensure mm->user_ns contains the execed files

When the user namespace support was merged the need to prevent
ptrace from revealing the contents of an unreadable executable
was overlooked.

Correct this oversight by ensuring that the executed file
or files are in mm->user_ns, by adjusting mm->user_ns.

Use the new function privileged_wrt_inode_uidgid to see if
the executable is a member of the user namespace, and as such
if having CAP_SYS_PTRACE in the user namespace should allow
tracing the executable.  If not update mm->user_ns to
the parent user namespace until an appropriate parent is found.
