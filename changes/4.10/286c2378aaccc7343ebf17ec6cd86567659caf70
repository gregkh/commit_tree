PCI: Remove pci_resource_bar() and pci_iov_resource_bar()

pci_std_update_resource() only deals with standard BARs, so we don't have
to worry about the complications of VF BARs in an SR-IOV capability.

Compute the BAR address inline and remove pci_resource_bar().  That makes
pci_iov_resource_bar() unused, so remove that as well.
