Remove references to dead make variable LINUX_INCLUDE

Commit 4fd06960f120 ("Use the new x86 setup code for i386") introduced a
reference to the make variable LINUX_INCLUDE. That reference got moved
around a bit and copied twice and now there are three references to it.

There has never been a definition of that variable. (Presumably that is
because it started out as a mistyped reference to LINUXINCLUDE.) So this
reference has always been an empty string. Let's remove it before it
spreads any further.
