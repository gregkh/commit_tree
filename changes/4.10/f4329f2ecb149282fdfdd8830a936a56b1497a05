powerpc/64s: Reduce exception alignment

Exception handlers are aligned to 128 bytes (L1 cache) on 64s, which is
overkill. It can reduce the icache footprint of any individual exception
path. However taken as a whole, the expansion in icache footprint seems
likely to be counter-productive and cause more total misses.

Create IFETCH_ALIGN_SHIFT/BYTES, which should give optimal ifetch
alignment with much more reasonable alignment. This saves 1792 bytes
from head_64.o text with an allmodconfig build.

Other subarchitectures should define appropriate IFETCH_ALIGN_SHIFT
values if this becomes more widely used.
