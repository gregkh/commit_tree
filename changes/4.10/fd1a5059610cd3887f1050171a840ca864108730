ALSA: usb-audio: more tolerant packetsize

since commit 57e6dae1087b ("ALSA: usb-audio: do not trust too-big
wMaxPacketSize values"), the expected packetsize is always limited
to nominal + 25%. It was discovered, that some devices (Android audio
accessory) have a much higher jitter in used packetsizes than 25%
which would result in BABBLE condition and dropping of packets.
A better solution is so assume the jitter to be the nominal packetsize:
-one nearly empty packet followed by a almost 150% sized one.

V2: changed to assume max frequency is +50 of nominal packetsize.
