powercap/intel_rapl: Track active CPUs internally

The ability of the CPU hotplug code to stop online/offline at each step
makes it necessary to track the activated CPUs in a package directly,
because outerwise a CPU offline callback can find CPUs which have already
executed the offline callback, but are not yet marked offline in the
topology mask. That could make such a CPU the package leader and in case
that CPU goes fully offline leave the package lead orphaned.
