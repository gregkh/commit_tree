console: Move userspace I/O out of console_lock to fix lockdep warning

When running certain workload on a debug kernel with lockdep turned on,
a ppc64 kvm guest could sometimes hit the following lockdep warning:

  [ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
   lock(&mm->mmap_sem);
                                lock(console_lock);
                                lock(&mm->mmap_sem);
   lock(cpu_hotplug.lock);

  *** DEADLOCK ***

Looking at the console code, the console_lock-->mmap_sem scenario will
only happen when reading or writing the console unicode map leading to
a page fault.

To break this circular locking dependency, all the userspace I/O
operations in consolemap.c are now moved outside of the console_lock
critical sections so that the mmap_sem won't be acquired when holding
the console_lock.
