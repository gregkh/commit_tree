cifs: Fix smbencrypt() to stop pointing a scatterlist at the stack

smbencrypt() points a scatterlist to the stack, which is breaks if
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y.

Fix it by switching to crypto_cipher_encrypt_one().  The new code
should be considerably faster as an added benefit.

This code is nearly identical to some code that Eric Biggers
suggested.
