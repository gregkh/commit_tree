audit: rework audit_log_start()

The backlog queue handling in audit_log_start() is a little odd with
some questionable design decisions, this patch attempts to rectify
this with the following changes:

* Never make auditd wait, ignore any backlog limits as we need auditd
awake so it can drain the backlog queue.

* When we hit a backlog limit and start dropping records, don't wake
all the tasks sleeping on the backlog, that's silly.  Instead, let
kauditd_thread() take care of waking everyone once it has had a chance
to drain the backlog queue.

* Don't keep a global backlog timeout countdown, make it per-task.  A
per-task timer means we won't have all the sleeping tasks waking at
the same time and hammering on an already stressed backlog queue.
