ARM: socfpga_defconfig: enable FS configs to support Angstrom filesystem

systemd on the Angstrom root file system expects AUTOFS to be configured
as a module and NFSD to be statically linked into the kernel. This patch
adds the necessary configuration to get rid two "FAILED" error messages
during systemd startup.
