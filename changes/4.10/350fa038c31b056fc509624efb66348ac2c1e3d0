ACPI / video: Add force_native quirk for Dell XPS 17 L702X

The Dell XPS 17 L702X has a non-working acpi_video0 backlight interface
and an intel_backlight interface which works fine. Add a force_native
quirk for it so that the non-working acpi_video0 interface does not get
registered.

Note that there also is an issue with the brightnesskeys on this laptop,
they do not generate key-press events in anyway. That is not solved by
this patch.
