USB: serial: ch341: add support for parity, frame length, stop bits

With the new reinitialization method, configuring parity, different
frame lengths and different stop bit settings should work as expected
on both CH340G and CH341A. Tested on a loopback-connected CH340G
with a logic analyzer in a number of different configurations.
