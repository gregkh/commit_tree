bridge: mcast: add IGMPv3 query support

This patch adds basic support for IGMPv3 queries, the default is IGMPv2
as before. A new multicast option - multicast_igmp_version, adds the
ability to change it between 2 and 3 via netlink and sysfs. The option
struct member is in a 4 byte hole in net_bridge.

There also a few minor style adjustments in br_multicast_new_group and
br_multicast_add_group.
