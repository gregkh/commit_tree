s390/pci: fix dma address calculation in map_sg

__s390_dma_map_sg maps a dma-contiguous area. Although we only map
whole pages we have to take into account that the area doesn't start
or stop at a page boundary because we use the dma address to loop
over the individual sg entries. Failing to do that might lead to an
access of the wrong sg entry.
