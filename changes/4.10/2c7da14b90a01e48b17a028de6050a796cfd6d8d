md/r5cache: sysfs entry journal_mode

With write cache, journal_mode is the knob to switch between
write-back and write-through.

Below is an example:

root@virt-test:~/# cat /sys/block/md0/md/journal_mode
[write-through] write-back
root@virt-test:~/# echo write-back > /sys/block/md0/md/journal_mode
root@virt-test:~/# cat /sys/block/md0/md/journal_mode
write-through [write-back]
