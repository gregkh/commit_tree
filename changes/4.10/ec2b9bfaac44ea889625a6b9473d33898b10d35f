kexec_file: Change kexec_add_buffer to take kexec_buf as argument.

This is done to simplify the kexec_add_buffer argument list.
Adapt all callers to set up a kexec_buf to pass to kexec_add_buffer.

In addition, change the type of kexec_buf.buffer from char * to void *.
There is no particular reason for it to be a char *, and the change
allows us to get rid of 3 existing casts to char * in the code.
