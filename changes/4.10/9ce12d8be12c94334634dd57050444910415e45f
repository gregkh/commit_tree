HID: asus: Add i2c touchpad support

Update the hid-asus module to add multitouch support for the Asus i2c touchpad.

This patch aims to resolve the issue raised here:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120181

The issue is in relation to an Asus touchpad device which currently does not
have multitouch support.

The device currently falls through to the hid-generic driver which
treats the device as a mouse.

This patch aims to add the multitouch support.
