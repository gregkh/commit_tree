PCI: Decouple IORESOURCE_ROM_ENABLE and PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE

Remove the assumption that IORESOURCE_ROM_ENABLE == PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE.
PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE is the ROM enable bit defined by the PCI spec, so if
we're reading or writing a BAR register value, that's what we should use.
IORESOURCE_ROM_ENABLE is a corresponding bit in struct resource flags.
