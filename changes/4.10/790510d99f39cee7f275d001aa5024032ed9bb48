net: Remove refnr arg when inserting link adjacencies

Commit 93409033ae65 ("net: Add netdev all_adj_list refcnt propagation to
fix panic") propagated the refnr to insert and remove functions tracking
the netdev adjacency graph. However, for the insert path the refnr can
only be 1. Accordingly, remove the refnr argument to make that clear.
ie., the refnr arg in 93409033ae65 was only needed for the remove path.
