gianfar: Do not reuse pages from emergency reserve

A driver using dev_alloc_page() must not reuse a page that had to
use emergency memory reserve.

Otherwise all packets using this page will be immediately dropped,
unless for very specific sockets having SOCK_MEMALLOC bit set.

This issue might be hard to debug, because only a fraction of the RX
ring buffer would suffer from drops.
