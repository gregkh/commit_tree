pinctrl-sx150x: Use handle_bad_irq instead of handle_edge_irq

Althought the function passed as a "handler" during GPIO chip
instantiation is not going to ever be called, specifying handle_edge_irq
there makes for a rather confusing read, both because no "ack" callback
in specified for irqchip and because there's no acking action is
necessary.

Specify handle_bad_irq instead a make a note of the situation. This
commit should be a no-op behaviour wise.
