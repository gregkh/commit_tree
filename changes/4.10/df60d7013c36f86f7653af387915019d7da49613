hwmon: (via-cputemp) Convert to hotplug state machine

Install the callbacks via the state machine and let the core invoke the
callbacks on the already online CPUs. When the hotplug state is
unregistered the cleanup function is called for each cpu. So both cpu loops
in init() and exit() are not longer required.
