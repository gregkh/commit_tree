HID: asus: Fix keyboard support

The previous submission which added Touchpad support broke the
Keyboard support of this driver. This patch:
1. fixes the Keyboard support (by assigning drvdata->input);
2. renames NOTEBOOK_QUIRKS to KEYBOARD_QUIRKS;
3. adds the NO_INIT_REPORT quirk to the KEYBOARD_QUIRKS; and
4. sets the input->name to 'Asus Keyboard' for the keyboard
