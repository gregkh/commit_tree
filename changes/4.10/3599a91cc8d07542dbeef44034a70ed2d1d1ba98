drm/i915: Allow shrinking of userptr objects once again

Commit 1bec9b0bda3d ("drm/i915/shrinker: Only shmemfs objects
are backed by swap") stopped considering the userptr objects
in shrinker callbacks.

Restore that so idle userptr objects can be discarded in order
to free up memory.

One change further to what was introduced in 1bec9b0bda3d is
to start considering userptr objects in oom but that should
also be a correct thing to do.

v2: Introduce I915_GEM_OBJECT_IS_SHRINKABLE. (Chris Wilson)
