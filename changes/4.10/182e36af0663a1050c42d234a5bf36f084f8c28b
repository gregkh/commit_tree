cpufreq: Avoid using inactive policies

There are two places in the cpufreq core in which low-level driver
callbacks may be invoked for an inactive cpufreq policy, which isn't
guaranteed to work in general.  Both are due to possible races with
CPU offline.

First, in cpufreq_get(), the policy may become inactive after
the check against policy->cpus in cpufreq_cpu_get() and before
policy->rwsem is acquired, in which case using it going forward may
not be correct.

Second, an analogous situation is possible in cpufreq_update_policy().

Avoid using inactive policies by adding policy_is_inactive() checks
to the code in the above places.
