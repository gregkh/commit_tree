ARM: 8634/1: hw_breakpoint: blacklist Scorpion CPUs

On APQ8060, the kernel crashes in arch_hw_breakpoint_init, taking an
undefined instruction trap within write_wb_reg. This is because Scorpion
CPUs erroneously appear to set DBGPRSR.SPD when WFI is issued, even if
the core is not powered down. When DBGPRSR.SPD is set, breakpoint and
watchpoint registers are treated as undefined.

It's possible to trigger similar crashes later on from userspace, by
requesting the kernel to install a breakpoint or watchpoint, as we can
go idle at any point between the reset of the debug registers and their
later use. This has always been the case.

Given that this has always been broken, no-one has complained until now,
and there is no clear workaround, disable hardware breakpoints and
watchpoints on Scorpion to avoid these issues.
