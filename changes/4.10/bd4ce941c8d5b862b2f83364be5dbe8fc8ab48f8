mlx4: Invoke softirqs after napi_reschedule

mlx4 may schedule napi from a workqueue. Afterwards, softirqs are not run
in a deterministic time frame and the following message may be logged:
NOHZ: local_softirq_pending 08

The problem is the same as what was described in commit ec13ee80145c
("virtio_net: invoke softirqs after __napi_schedule") and this patch
applies the same fix to mlx4.
