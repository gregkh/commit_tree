Btrfs: disable xattr operations on subvolume directories

When you snapshot a subvolume containing a subvolume, you get a
placeholder directory where the subvolume would be. These directory
inodes have ->i_ops set to btrfs_dir_ro_inode_operations. Previously,
these i_ops didn't include the xattr operation callbacks. The conversion
to xattr_handlers missed this case, leading to bogus attempts to set
xattrs on these inodes. This manifested itself as failures when running
delayed inodes.

To fix this, clear IOP_XATTR in ->i_opflags on these inodes.
