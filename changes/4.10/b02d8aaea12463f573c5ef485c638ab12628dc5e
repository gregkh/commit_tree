block: Check partition alignment on zoned block devices

Both blkdev_report_zones and blkdev_reset_zones can operate on a partition of
a zoned block device. However, the first and last zones reported for a
partition make sense only if the partition start sector and size are aligned
on the device zone size. The same applies for zone reset. Resetting the first
or the last zone of a partition straddling zones may impact neighboring
partitions. Finally, if a partition start sector is not at the beginning of a
sequential zone, it will be impossible to write to the first sectors of the
partition on a host-managed device.
Avoid all these problems and incoherencies by ignoring partitions that are not
zone aligned.

Note: Even with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED disabled, bdev_is_zoned() will report the
correct disk zoning type (host-aware, host-managed or none) but
bdev_zone_size() will always return 0 for zoned block devices (i.e. the zone
size is unknown). So test this as a way to ensure that a zoned block device is
being handled as such. As a result, for a host-aware devices, unaligned zone
partitions will be accepted with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED disabled. That is, the
disk will be treated as a regular block device (as it should). If zoned block
device support is enabled, only aligned partitions will be accepted.
