soc/qman: Remove unused struct qm_mcc* layouts

1. qm_mcc_querywq layout not used for now, so drop it;
2. queryfq, queryfq_np and alterfq are used only for accesses to
   the 'fqid' field, so replace these with a generic 'fq' layout.
   As a consequence, 'querycgr' turns into 'cgr' following the
   same reasoning above and for consistent naming.
