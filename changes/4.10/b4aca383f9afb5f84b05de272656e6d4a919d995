platform/x86: intel_mid_thermal: Fix suspend handlers unused warning

Fix:

  drivers/platform/x86/intel_mid_thermal.c:424:12: warning: ‘mid_thermal_resume’
  defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
   static int mid_thermal_resume(struct device *dev)
              ^
  drivers/platform/x86/intel_mid_thermal.c:436:12: warning: ‘mid_thermal_suspend’
  defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
   static int mid_thermal_suspend(struct device *dev)
              ^

which I see during randbuilds here.
