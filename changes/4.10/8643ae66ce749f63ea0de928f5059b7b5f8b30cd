scsi: ufs: fail ufshcd_probe_hba() if power configuration fails

In case the power configuration fails, skip further processing of the
probing function and return immediately. This has 2 reasons:

1. Don't allow the UFS to continue running in PWM

2. Avoid multiple calls to pm_runtime_put_sync() when not in error
   handling or power management contexts
