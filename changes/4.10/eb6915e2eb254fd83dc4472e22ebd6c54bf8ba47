batman-adv: Remove unused skb_reset_mac_header()

During broadcast queueing, the skb_reset_mac_header() sets the skb
to a place invalid for a MAC header, pointing right into the
batman-adv broadcast packet. Luckily, no one seems to actually use
eth_hdr(skb) afterwards until batadv_send_skb_packet() resets the
header to a valid position again.

Therefore removing this unnecessary, weird skb_reset_mac_header()
call.
