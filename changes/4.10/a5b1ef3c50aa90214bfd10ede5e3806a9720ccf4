ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb: add the USB reset also to the second USB PHY

When the USB PHY driver was introduced the reset framework did not
have support for triggering a reset pulse for shared resets. On GXBB
however there is only one reset line for both PHYs (meaning we have a
shared reset line). With the latest changes to the reset framework and
the corresponding updates to the phy-meson8b-usb2 driver we can now pass
the reset to the second PHY as well.
