powerpc/eeh: Enable IO path on permanent error

We give up recovery on permanent error, simply shutdown the affected
devices and remove them. If the devices can't be put into quiet state,
they spew more traffic that is likely to cause another unexpected EEH
error. This was observed on "p8dtu2u" machine:

   0002:00:00.0 PCI bridge: IBM Device 03dc
   0002:01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation \
                Ethernet Controller X710/X557-AT 10GBASE-T (rev 02)
   0002:01:00.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation \
                Ethernet Controller X710/X557-AT 10GBASE-T (rev 02)
   0002:01:00.2 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation \
                Ethernet Controller X710/X557-AT 10GBASE-T (rev 02)
   0002:01:00.3 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation \
                Ethernet Controller X710/X557-AT 10GBASE-T (rev 02)

On P8 PowerNV platform, the IO path is frozen when shutdowning the
devices, meaning the memory registers are inaccessible. It is why
the devices can't be put into quiet state before removing them.
This fixes the issue by enabling IO path prior to putting the devices
into quiet state.
