ARM: dts: dra72-evm-tps65917: Add voltage supplies to usb_phy, mmc, dss

Commit 5d080aa30681 ("ARM: dts: dra72: Add separate dtsi for tps65917")
added a separate dtsi for dra72-evm-tps65917 moving all the voltage supplies
to this file. But it missed adding voltage supplies to usb_phy, mmc,
dss and deleted from dra72-evm-common.dtsi. Adding the voltage supply
phandles to these nodes in dra72-evm-tps65917.dtsi
