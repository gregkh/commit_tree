s390: convert remaining bootmem allocations to memblock

Get rid of all remaining alloc_bootmem calls and use memblock_alloc
instead everywhere.  This way we get rid of the inconsistent mixture
of alloc_bootmem and memblock_alloc usages.

Two of the alloc_bootmem_low calls within arch/s390/kernel/setup.c are
replaced with memblock_alloc calls that don't enforce that the
allocated memory is below 2GB. This restriction was never necessary.
