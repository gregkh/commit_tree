drm/i915: Always use the GTT for error capture

Since the GTT provides universal access to any GPU page, we can use it
to reduce our plethora of read methods to just one. It also has the
important characteristic of being exactly what the GPU sees - if there
are incoherency problems, seeing the batch as executed (rather than as
trapped inside the cpu cache) is important.
