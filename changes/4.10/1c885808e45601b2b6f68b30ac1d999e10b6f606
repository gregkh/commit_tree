tcp: SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS option for SO_TIMESTAMPING

This patch exports the sender chronograph stats via the socket
SO_TIMESTAMPING channel. Currently we can instrument how long a
particular application unit of data was queued in TCP by tracking
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE and SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SCHED. Having
these sender chronograph stats exported simultaneously along with
these timestamps allow further breaking down the various sender
limitation.  For example, a video server can tell if a particular
chunk of video on a connection takes a long time to deliver because
TCP was experiencing small receive window. It is not possible to
tell before this patch without packet traces.

To prepare these stats, the user needs to set
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS and SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_TSONLY flags
while requesting other SOF_TIMESTAMPING TX timestamps. When the
timestamps are available in the error queue, the stats are returned
in a separate control message of type SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS,
in a list of TLVs (struct nlattr) of types: TCP_NLA_BUSY_TIME,
TCP_NLA_RWND_LIMITED, TCP_NLA_SNDBUF_LIMITED. Unit is microsecond.
