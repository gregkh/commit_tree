drm/nouveau/nouveau/led: prevent compiling the led-code if nouveau=y and leds=m

The proper fix would have been to select LEDS_CLASS but this can lead
to a circular dependency, as found out by Arnd.

This patch implements Arnd's suggestion instead, at the cost of some
auto-magic for a fringe feature.
