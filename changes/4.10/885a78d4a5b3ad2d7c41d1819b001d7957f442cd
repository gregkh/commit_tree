module: Ensure a module's state is set accordingly during module coming cleanup code

In load_module() in the event of an error, for e.g. unknown module
parameter(s) specified we go to perform some module coming clean up
operations. At this point the module is still in a "formed" state
when it is actually going away.

This patch updates the module's state accordingly to ensure anyone on the
module_notify_list waiting for a module going away notification will be
notified accordingly.
