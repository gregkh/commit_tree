dm crypt: rename crypt_setkey_allcpus to crypt_setkey

In the past, dm-crypt used per-cpu crypto context. This has been removed
in the kernel 3.15 and the crypto context is shared between all cpus. This
patch renames the function crypt_setkey_allcpus to crypt_setkey, because
there is really no activity that is done for all cpus.
