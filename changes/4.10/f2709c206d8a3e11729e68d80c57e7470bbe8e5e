Revert "[media] dvb_frontend: merge duplicate dvb_tuner_ops.release implementations"

While this patch sounded a good idea, unfortunately, it causes
bad dependencies, as drivers that would otherwise work without
the DVB core will now break:

ERROR: "dvb_tuner_simple_release" [drivers/media/tuners/tea5767.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "dvb_tuner_simple_release" [drivers/media/tuners/tea5761.ko] undefined!

ERROR: "dvb_tuner_simple_release" [drivers/media/tuners/fc0011.ko] undefined!

So, we have to revert it.

Note: as the argument for the release ops changed from "int"
to "void", we needed to change it at the revert patch, to
avoid compilation issues like:
	drivers/media/tuners/tea5767.c:437:23: error: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
	  .release           = tea5767_release,
	                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This reverts commit 22a613e89825ea7a3984a968463cc6d425bd8856.
