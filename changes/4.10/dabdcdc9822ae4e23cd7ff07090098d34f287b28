drm/vmwgfx: Switch to mode_cmd2

Surprisingly few changes needed to make it happen. Compile-tested
only. The idea is that this replaces the 2 patches from Ville's big
fb->format patch series as a prep patch. Only impact to later patches
should be the one instace added in this patch where we look at
fb->pixel_format (instead of fb->bpp and fb->depth), so minor
adjustements in the cocci-generated patches needed.

v2: Restore pitch computation in vmw_fb_kms_framebuffer (Sinclair).
