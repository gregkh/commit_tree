ipv4: fib: Allow for consistent FIB dumping

The next patch will enable listeners of the FIB notification chain to
request a dump of the FIB tables. However, since RTNL isn't taken during
the dump, it's possible for the FIB tables to change mid-dump, which
will result in inconsistency between the listener's table and the
kernel's.

Allow listeners to know about changes that occurred mid-dump, by adding
a change sequence counter to each net namespace. The counter is
incremented just before a notification is sent in the FIB chain.
