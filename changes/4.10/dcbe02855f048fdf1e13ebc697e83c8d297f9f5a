arm64: thread_info remove stale items

We have a comment claiming __switch_to() cares about where cpu_context
is located relative to cpu_domain in thread_info. However arm64 has
never had a thread_info::cpu_domain field, and neither __switch_to nor
cpu_switch_to care where the cpu_context field is relative to others.

Additionally, the init_thread_info alias is never used anywhere in the
kernel, and will shortly become problematic when thread_info is moved
into task_struct.

This patch removes both.
