staging: lustre: ptlrpc: race at req processing

Fix: 5c689e689baa ("staging/lustre/ptlrpc: race at req processing")
decreased the race window, but does not remove it. Disable rq_resend
right after MSG_REPLAY flag set. Import lock protects two threads
from race between set/clear MSG_REPLAY and rq_resend flags.
