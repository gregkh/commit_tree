powerpc/sysfs: Convert to hotplug state machine

Install the callbacks via the state machine and let the core invoke
the callbacks on the already online CPUs.

The previous convention of keeping the files around until the CPU is dead
has not been preserved as there is no point to keep them available when the
cpu is going down. This makes the hotplug call symmetric.
