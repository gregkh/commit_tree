net: dev: Improve debug statements for adjacency tracking

Adjacency code only has debugs for the insert case. Add debugs for
the remove path and make both consistently worded to make it easier
to follow the insert and removal with reference counts.

In addition, change the BUG to a WARN_ON. A missing adjacency at
removal time is not cause for a panic.
