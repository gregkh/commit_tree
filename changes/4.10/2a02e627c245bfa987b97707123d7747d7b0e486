lightnvm: eliminate nvm_block abstraction on mm

In order to naturally support multi-target instances on an Open-Channel
SSD, targets should own the LUNs they get blocks from and manage
provisioning internally. This is done in several steps.

A part of this transformation is that targets manage their blocks
internally. This patch eliminates the nvm_block abstraction and moves
block management to the target logic. The rrpc target is transformed.
