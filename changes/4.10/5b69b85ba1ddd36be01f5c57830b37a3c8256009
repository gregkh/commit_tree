PCI/ACPI: Check for platform-specific MCFG quirks

The PCIe spec (r3.0, sec 7.2.2) specifies an "Enhanced Configuration Access
Mechanism" (ECAM) for memory-mapped access to configuration space.  ECAM is
required for PCIe systems unless there's a standard firmware interface for
config access.

In the absence of a firmware interface, we use pci_generic_ecam_ops, and on
ACPI systems, we discover the ECAM space via the MCFG table and/or the _CBA
method.

Unfortunately some systems provide MCFG but don't implement ECAM according
to spec, so we need a mechanism for quirks to make those systems work.

Add an MCFG quirk mechanism to override the config accessor functions
and/or the memory-mapped address space.

A quirk is selected if it matches all of the following:

  - OEM ID
  - OEM Table ID
  - OEM Revision
  - PCI segment (from _SEG)
  - PCI bus number range (from _CRS, wildcard allowed)

If the quirk specifies config accessor functions or a memory-mapped address
range, these override the defaults.
