get_maintainer: look for arbitrary letter prefixes in sections

Jani Nikula proposes patches to add a few new letter prefixes for "B:"
bug reporting and "C:" maintainer chatting to the various sections of
MAINTAINERS.

Add a generic mechanism to get_maintainer.pl to find sections that have
any combination of "[A-Z]" letter prefix types in a section.
