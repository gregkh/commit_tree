net: ns83820: use dev_kfree_skb_irq instead of kfree_skb

It is not allowed to call kfree_skb() from hardware interrupt
context or with interrupts being disabled, spin_lock_irqsave()
make sure always in irq disable context. So the kfree_skb()
should be replaced with dev_kfree_skb_irq().

This is detected by Coccinelle semantic patch.
