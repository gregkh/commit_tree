vfio/spapr: Add a helper to create default DMA window

There is already a helper to create a DMA window which does allocate
a table and programs it to the IOMMU group. However
tce_iommu_take_ownership_ddw() did not use it and did these 2 calls
itself to simplify error path.

Since we are going to delay the default window creation till
the default window is accessed/removed or new window is added,
we need a helper to create a default window from all these cases.

This adds tce_iommu_create_default_window(). Since it relies on
a VFIO container to have at least one IOMMU group (for future use),
this changes tce_iommu_attach_group() to add a group to the container
first and then call the new helper.
