ACPI/IORT: Replace rid map type with type mask

IORT tables provide data that allow the kernel to carry out
device ID mappings between endpoints and system components
(eg interrupt controllers, IOMMUs). When the mapping for a
given device ID is carried out, the translation mechanism
is done on a per-subsystem basis rather than a component
subtype (ie the IOMMU kernel layer will look for mappings
from a device to all IORT node types corresponding to IOMMU
components), therefore the corresponding mapping API should
work on a range (ie mask) of IORT node types corresponding
to a common set of components (eg IOMMUs) rather than a
specific node type.

Upgrade the IORT iort_node_map_rid() API to work with a
type mask instead of a single node type so that it can
be used for mappings that span multiple components types
(ie IOMMUs).
