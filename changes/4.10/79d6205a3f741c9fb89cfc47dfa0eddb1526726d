[media] v4l: tvp5150: Don't override output pinmuxing at stream on/off time

The s_stream() handler incorrectly writes the whole MISC_CTL register to
enable or disable the outputs, overriding the output pinmuxing
configuration. Fix it to only touch the output enable bits.

The CONF_SHARED_PIN register is also written by the same function,
resulting in muxing the INTREQ signal instead of the VBLK/GPCL signal on
the INTREQ/GPCL/VBLK pin. As the driver doesn't support interrupts this
is obviously incorrect, and breaks operation on other devices. Fix it by
removing the write.
