ila: Fix crash caused by rhashtable changes

commit ca26893f05e86 ("rhashtable: Add rhlist interface")
added a field to rhashtable_iter so that length became 56 bytes
and would exceed the size of args in netlink_callback (which is
48 bytes). The netlink diag dump function already has been
allocating a iter structure and storing the pointed to that
in the args of netlink_callback. ila_xlat also uses
rhahstable_iter but is still putting that directly in
the arg block. Now since rhashtable_iter size is increased
we are overwriting beyond the structure. The next field
happens to be cb_mutex pointer in netlink_sock and hence the crash.

Fix is to alloc the rhashtable_iter and save it as pointer
in arg.

Tested:

  modprobe ila
  ./ip ila add loc 3333:0:0:0 loc_match 2222:0:0:1,
  ./ip ila list  # NO crash now
