x86: Enable Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0

On platforms supporting Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, the maximum
turbo frequencies of some cores in a CPU package may be higher than for
the other cores in the same package.  In that case, better performance
(and possibly lower energy consumption as well) can be achieved by
making the scheduler prefer to run tasks on the CPUs with higher max
turbo frequencies.

To that end, set up a core priority metric to abstract the core
preferences based on the maximum turbo frequency.  In that metric,
the cores with higher maximum turbo frequencies are higher-priority
than the other cores in the same package and that causes the scheduler
to favor them when making load-balancing decisions using the asymmertic
packing approach.  At the same time, the priority of SMT threads with a
higher CPU number is reduced so as to avoid scheduling tasks on all of
the threads that belong to a favored core before all of the other cores
have been given a task to run.

The priority metric will be initialized by the P-state driver with the
help of the sched_set_itmt_core_prio() function.  The P-state driver
will also determine whether or not ITMT is supported by the platform
and will call sched_set_itmt_support() to indicate that.
