radix-tree: move rcu_head into a union with private_list

I want to be able to reference node->parent after freeing node.

Currently node->parent is in a union with rcu_head, so it is overwritten
when the node is put on the RCU list.  We know that private_list is not
referenced after the node is freed, so it is safe for these two members
to share space.
