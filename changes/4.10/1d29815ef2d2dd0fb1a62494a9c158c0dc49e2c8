cpufreq: intel_pstate: Drop boost_iowait flag

The "IOwait boosting" mechanism is only used by the
get_target_pstate_use_cpu_load() governor function and the
boost_iowait flag in pid_params is always set when that function
is in use (and it is never set otherwise).  This means that the
boost_iowait flag is in fact redundant and may be dropped.

For this reason, replace the boost_iowait flag check in
intel_pstate_update_util() with an equivalent check against
pstate_funcs.get_target_pstate and drop that flag.
