frv: add atomic64_add_unless()

The build of frv allmodconfig was failing with the error:
lib/atomic64_test.c:209:9: error:

	implicit declaration of function 'atomic64_add_unless'

All the atomic64 operations were defined in frv, but
atomic64_add_unless() was not done.

Implement atomic64_add_unless() as done in other arches.
