thermal: rockchip: fixes the conversion table

As Ayaka reported the thermal was abormal on rk3288 at booting time.
thermal thermal_zone1: critical temperature reached(125 C),shutting down
thermal thermal_zone2: critical temperature reached(125 C),shutting down
thermal thermal_zone1: critical temperature reached(125 C),shutting down
thermal thermal_zone2: critical temperature reached(125 C),shutting down
...
The root caused by reading the invald analogic value, the value is zero
will convert the 125 degree to trigger the critical temperature.
Fixes it with insteading of the incorrect reading now.

Fixes commit cadf29dc2a8bcaae83
("thermal: rockchip: optimize the conversion table")
