scsi: ufshcd: Fix possible unclocked register access

Vendor specific setup_clocks callback may require the clocks managed by
ufshcd driver to be ON. So if the vendor specific setup_clocks callback
is called while the required clocks are turned off, it could result into
unclocked register access.

To prevent possible unclock register access, this change adds one more
argument to setup_clocks callback to let it know whether it is called
pre/post the clock changes by core driver.
