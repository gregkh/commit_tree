IB/mlx4: Handle well-known-gid in mad_demux processing

If OpenSM runs over a ConnectX-3, and there are ConnectX-4 or Connect-IB
VFs active on the network, the OpenSM will receive QP1 packets containing
a GRH where the destination GID is the "Well-Known GID" -- which is not a
GID in the HCA Port's GID Table.

This GID must be tested-for separately -- and packets which contain
this destination GID should be routed to slave 0 (the PF).
