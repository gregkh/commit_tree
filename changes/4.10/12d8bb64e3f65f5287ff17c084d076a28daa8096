bpf: xdp: Add XDP example for head adjustment

The XDP prog checks if the incoming packet matches any VIP:PORT
combination in the BPF hashmap.  If it is, it will encapsulate
the packet with a IPv4/v6 header as instructed by the value of
the BPF hashmap and then XDP_TX it out.

The VIP:PORT -> IP-Encap-Info can be specified by the cmd args
of the user prog.
