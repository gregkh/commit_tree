clk: add devm_get_clk_from_child() API

Some driver is using this type of DT bindings for clock (more detail,
see ${LINUX}/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/simple-card.txt).

	sound_soc {
		...
		cpu {
			clocks = <&xxx>;
			...
		};
		codec {
			clocks = <&xxx>;
			...
		};
	};

Current driver in this case uses of_clk_get() for each node, but there
is no devm_of_clk_get() today.
OTOH, the problem of having devm_of_clk_get() is that it encourages the
use of of_clk_get() when clk_get() is more desirable.

Thus, this patch adds new devm_get_clk_from_chile() which explicitly
reads as get a clock from a child node of this device.
By this function, we can also use this type of DT bindings

	sound_soc {
		clocks = <&xxx>, <&xxx>;
		clock-names = "cpu", "codec";
		clock-ranges;
		...
		cpu {
			...
		};
		codec {
			...
		};
	};
