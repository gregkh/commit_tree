tcp: tsq: add a shortcut in tcp_small_queue_check()

Always allow the two first skbs in write queue to be sent,
regardless of sk_wmem_alloc/sk_pacing_rate values.

This helps a lot in situations where TX completions are delayed either
because of driver latencies or softirq latencies.

Test is done with no cache line misses.
