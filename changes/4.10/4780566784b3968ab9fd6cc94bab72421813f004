dctcp: update cwnd on congestion event

draft-ietf-tcpm-dctcp-02 says:

... when the sender receives an indication of congestion
(ECE), the sender SHOULD update cwnd as follows:

         cwnd = cwnd * (1 - DCTCP.Alpha / 2)

So, lets do this and reduce cwnd more smoothly (and faster), as per
current congestion estimate.
