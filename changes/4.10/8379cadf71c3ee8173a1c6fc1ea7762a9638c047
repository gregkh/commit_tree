virtio_console: fix a crash in config_work_handler

Using control_work instead of config_work as the 3rd argument to
container_of results in an invalid portdev pointer. Indeed, the work
structure is initialized as below:

    INIT_WORK(&portdev->config_work, &config_work_handler);

It leads to a crash when portdev->vdev is dereferenced later. This
bug
is triggered when the guest uses a virtio-console without multiport
feature and receives a config_changed virtio interrupt.
