md: cleanup mddev flag clear for takeover

Commit 6995f0b (md: takeover should clear unrelated bits) clear
unrelated bits, but it's quite fragile. To avoid error in the future,
define a macro for unsupported mddev flags for each raid type and use it
to clear unsupported mddev flags. This should be less error-prone.
