net: l2tp: change L2TP_ATTR_UDP_ZERO_CSUM6_{RX, TX} attribute types

The attributes L2TP_ATTR_UDP_ZERO_CSUM6_RX and
L2TP_ATTR_UDP_ZERO_CSUM6_TX are used as flags,
but is defined as a u8 in a comment.

This patch redocuments them as flags.

Adding nla_policy entries would break API, so not doing that.
