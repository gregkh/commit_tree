USB: serial: pl2303: fix NULL-deref at open

Fix NULL-pointer dereference in open() should a type-0 or type-1 device
lack the expected endpoints:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000030
...
PC is at pl2303_open+0x38/0xec [pl2303]

Note that a missing interrupt-in endpoint would have caused open() to
fail.
