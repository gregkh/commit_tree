selinux: normalize input to /sys/fs/selinux/enforce

At present, one can write any signed integer value to
/sys/fs/selinux/enforce and it will be stored,
e.g. echo -1 > /sys/fs/selinux/enforce or echo 2 >
/sys/fs/selinux/enforce. This makes no real difference
to the kernel, since it only ever cares if it is zero or non-zero,
but some userspace code compares it with 1 to decide if SELinux
is enforcing, and this could confuse it. Only a process that is
already root and is allowed the setenforce permission in SELinux
policy can write to /sys/fs/selinux/enforce, so this is not considered
to be a security issue, but it should be fixed.
