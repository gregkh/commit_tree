xen/balloon: Only mark a page as managed when it is released

Only mark a page as managed when it is released back to the allocator.
This ensures that the managed page count does not get falsely increased
when a VM is running. Correspondingly change it so that pages are
marked as unmanaged after getting them from the allocator.
