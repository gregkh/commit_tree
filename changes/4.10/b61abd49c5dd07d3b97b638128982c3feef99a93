drm/hisilicon/hibmc: mark PM functions __maybe_unused

When CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is disabled, we get a harmless warning

drm/hisilicon/hibmc/hibmc_drm_drv.c:115:12: error: ‘hibmc_pm_resume’ defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
drm/hisilicon/hibmc/hibmc_drm_drv.c:97:12: error: ‘hibmc_pm_suspend’ defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Marking the functions as __maybe_unused avoids the warning without
having to add an #ifdef.
