IB/core: Let create_ah return extended response to user

Add struct ib_udata to the signature of create_ah callback that is
implemented by IB device drivers. This allows HW drivers to return extra
data to the userspace library.
This patch prepares the ground for mlx5 driver to resolve destination
mac address for a given GID and return it to userspace.
This patch was previously submitted by Knut Omang as a part of the
patch set to support Oracle's Infiniband HCA (SIF).
