drm/i915/fbc: inline intel_fbc_can_choose()

It only has two checks now, so it makes sense to just move the code to
the caller.

Also take this opportunity to make no_fbc_reason make more sense: now
we'll only list "no suitable CRTC for FBC" instead of maybe giving a
reason why the last CRTC we checked was not selected, and we'll more
consistently set the reason (e.g., if no primary planes are visible).
