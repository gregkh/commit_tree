ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add support for H3 codec

The codec on the H3 is similar to the one found on the A31. One key
difference is the analog path controls are routed through the PRCM
block. This is supported by the sun8i-codec-analog driver, and tied
into this codec driver with the audio card's aux_dev.

In addition, the H3 has no HP (headphone) and HBIAS support, and no
MIC3 input. The FIFO related registers are slightly rearranged.
