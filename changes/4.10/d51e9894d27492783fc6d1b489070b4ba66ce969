mm/mempolicy.c: do not put mempolicy before using its nodemask

Since commit be97a41b291e ("mm/mempolicy.c: merge alloc_hugepage_vma to
alloc_pages_vma") alloc_pages_vma() can potentially free a mempolicy by
mpol_cond_put() before accessing the embedded nodemask by
__alloc_pages_nodemask().  The commit log says it's so "we can use a
single exit path within the function" but that's clearly wrong.  We can
still do that when doing mpol_cond_put() after the allocation attempt.

Make sure the mempolicy is not freed prematurely, otherwise
__alloc_pages_nodemask() can end up using a bogus nodemask, which could
lead e.g.  to premature OOM.

Fixes: be97a41b291e ("mm/mempolicy.c: merge alloc_hugepage_vma to alloc_pages_vma")
