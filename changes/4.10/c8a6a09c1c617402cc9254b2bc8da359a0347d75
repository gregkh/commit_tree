vme: Fix wrong pointer utilization in ca91cx42_slave_get

In ca91cx42_slave_get function, the value pointed by vme_base pointer is
set through:

*vme_base = ioread32(bridge->base + CA91CX42_VSI_BS[i]);

So it must be dereferenced to be used in calculation of pci_base:

*pci_base = (dma_addr_t)*vme_base + pci_offset;

This bug was caught thanks to the following gcc warning:

drivers/vme/bridges/vme_ca91cx42.c: In function ‘ca91cx42_slave_get’:
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_ca91cx42.c:467:14: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
*pci_base = (dma_addr_t)vme_base + pci_offset;
