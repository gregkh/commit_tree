s390: cio: make it explicitly non-modular

The Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is:

  obj-y += airq.o blacklist.o chsc.o cio.o css.o chp.o idset.o isc.o \
          fcx.o itcw.o crw.o ccwreq.o trace.o ioasm.o
  ccw_device-objs += device.o device_fsm.o device_ops.o
  ccw_device-objs += device_id.o device_pgid.o device_status.o
  obj-y += ccw_device.o cmf.o

...meaning that the files here are not being built as modular.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the code there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We replace module.h with export.h where the file does export some
symbols.
