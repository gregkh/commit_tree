i2c: sh_mobile: Add per-Generation fallback bindings

Add per-Generation fallback bindings for R-Car SoCs.

This is in keeping with the compatibility string scheme is being adopted
for drivers for Renesas SoCs.

Also, improve readability by listing the rmobile fallback compatibility
string after the more-specific compatibility strings they provide a
fallback for.
