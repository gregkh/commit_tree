printk: remove games with previous record flags

The record logging code looks at the previous record flags in various
ways, and they are all wrong.

You can't use the previous record flags to determine anything about the
next record, because they may simply not be related.  In particular, the
reason the previous record was a continuation record may well be exactly
_because_ the new record was printed by a different process, which is
why the previous record was flushed.

So all those games are simply wrong, and make the code hard to
understand (because the code fundamentally cdoes not make sense).

So remove it.
