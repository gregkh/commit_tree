ARM: 8657/1: uaccess: consistently check object sizes

In commit 76624175dcae ("arm64: uaccess: consistently check object sizes"),
the object size checks are moved outside the access_ok() so that bad
destinations are detected before hitting the "memset(dest, 0, size)" in the
copy_from_user() failure path.

This makes the same change for arm, with attention given to possibly
extracting the uaccess routines into a common header file for all
architectures in the future.
