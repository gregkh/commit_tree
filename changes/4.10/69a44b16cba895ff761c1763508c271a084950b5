drm/i915: Add spurious CRT DMI match for Intel DZ77BH-55K

Intel DZ77BH-55K board doest't have a physical VGA connector,
and yet it always detects that something is connected there.
Add it to the DMI blacklist to ignore the spurious detection
results.

Allows me to drop 'video=VGA-1:d' from my kernel cmdline.
