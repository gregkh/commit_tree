wil6210: add debugfs blobs for UCODE code and data

Added new areas to fw_mappings area for UCODE code
and data areas.
The new areas are only exposed through debugfs blobs,
and mainly needed to access UCODE logs.
The change does not affect crash dumps because the
newly added areas overlap with the "upper" area which
is already dumped.
