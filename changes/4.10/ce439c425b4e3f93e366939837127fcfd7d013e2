staging: vt6656: Compress return logic into one line.

Compress the return logic into one line avoids unnecessary variable
declarations. In this case it also makes it easier to understand the
function.

Coccinelle was used to find this return statement. However, additional
compressions were done to make the function clearer.

Semantic patch:

local idexpression ret;

-ret =

     e;
-return ret;
