drm/i915: Wait first for submission, before waiting for request completion

In future patches, we will no longer be able to wait on a static global
seqno and instead have to break our wait up into phases. First we wait
for the global seqno assignment (upon submission to hardware), and once
submitted we wait for the hardware to complete.
