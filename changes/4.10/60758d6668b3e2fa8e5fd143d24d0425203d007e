perf bench futex: Sanitize numeric parameters

This gets rid of oddities such as:

  perf bench futex hash -t -4
  perf: calloc: Cannot allocate memory

Runtime (and many more) are equally busted, i.e. run for bogus amounts of
time. Just use the abs, instead of, for example errorring out.

Committer note:

After the patch:

  $ perf bench futex hash -t -4
  # Running 'futex/hash' benchmark:
  Run summary [PID 10178]: 4 threads, each operating on 1024 [private] futexes for 10 secs.
