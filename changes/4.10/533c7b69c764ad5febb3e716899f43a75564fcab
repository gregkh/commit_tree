audit: use proper refcount locking on audit_sock

Resetting audit_sock appears to be racy.

audit_sock was being copied and dereferenced without using a refcount on
the source sock.

Bump the refcount on the underlying sock when we store a refrence in
audit_sock and release it when we reset audit_sock.  audit_sock
modification needs the audit_cmd_mutex.
