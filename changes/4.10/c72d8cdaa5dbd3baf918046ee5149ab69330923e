net: fix bogus cast in skb_pagelen() and use unsigned variables

1) cast to "int" is unnecessary:
   u8 will be promoted to int before decrementing,
   small positive numbers fit into "int", so their values won't be changed
   during promotion.

   Once everything is int including loop counters, signedness doesn't
   matter: 32-bit operations will stay 32-bit operations.

   But! Someone tried to make this loop smart by making everything of
   the same type apparently in an attempt to optimise it.
   Do the optimization, just differently.
   Do the cast where it matters. :^)

2) frag size is unsigned entity and sum of fragments sizes is also
   unsigned.

Make everything unsigned, leave no MOVSX instruction behind.
