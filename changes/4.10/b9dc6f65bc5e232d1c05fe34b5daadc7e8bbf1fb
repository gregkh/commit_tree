fix a fencepost error in pipe_advance()

The logics in pipe_advance() used to release all buffers past the new
position failed in cases when the number of buffers to release was equal
to pipe->buffers.  If that happened, none of them had been released,
leaving pipe full.  Worse, it was trivial to trigger and we end up with
pipe full of uninitialized pages.  IOW, it's an infoleak.
