tools build: Add feature detection for clang

Check if basic clang compiling environment is ready.

Doesn't like 'llvm-config --libs' which can returns llvm libraries in right
order and duplicates some libraries if necessary, there's no correspondence for
clang libraries (-lclangxxx). to avoid extra complexity and to avoid new clang
breaking libraries ordering, use --start-group and --end-group.

In this test case, manually identify required clang libs and hope it to be
stable. Putting all clang libraries here is possible (use make's wildcard), but
then feature checking becomes very slow.
