radix-tree: delete radix_tree_range_tag_if_tagged()

This is an exceptionally complicated function with just one caller
(tag_pages_for_writeback).  We devote a large portion of the runtime of
the test suite to testing this one function which has one caller.  By
introducing the new function radix_tree_iter_tag_set(), we can eliminate
all of the complexity while keeping the performance.  The caller can now
use a fairly standard radix_tree_for_each() loop, and it doesn't need to
worry about tricksy things like 'start' wrapping.

The test suite continues to spend a large amount of time investigating
this function, but now it's testing the underlying primitives such as
radix_tree_iter_resume() and the radix_tree_for_each_tagged() iterator
which are also used by other parts of the kernel.
