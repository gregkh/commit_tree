net: sctp: fix array overrun read on sctp_timer_tbl

The comparison on the timeout can lead to an array overrun
read on sctp_timer_tbl because of an off-by-one error. Fix
this by using < instead of <= and also compare to the array
size rather than SCTP_EVENT_TIMEOUT_MAX.

Fixes CoverityScan CID#1397639 ("Out-of-bounds read")
