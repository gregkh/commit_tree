mmc: sdhci-msm: Update DLL reset sequence

SDCC core with minor version >= 0x42 introduced new 14lpp
DLL. This has additional requirements in the reset sequence
for DLL tuning. Make necessary changes as needed.

Without this patch we see below errors on such SDHC controllers
	sdhci_msm 7464900.sdhci: mmc0: DLL failed to LOCK
	mmc0: tuning execution failed: -110
