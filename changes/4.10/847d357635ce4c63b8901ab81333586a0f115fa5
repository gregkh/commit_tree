radix tree test suite: track preempt_count

Rather than simply NOP out preempt_enable() and preempt_disable(), keep
track of preempt_count and display it regularly in case either the test
suite or the code under test is forgetting to balance the enables &
disables.  Only found a test-case that was forgetting to re-enable
preemption, but it's a possibility worth checking.
