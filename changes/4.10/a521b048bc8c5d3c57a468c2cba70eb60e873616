s390/dasd: channel path aware error recovery

With this feature, the DASD device driver more robustly handles DASDs
that are attached via multiple channel paths and are subject to
constant Interface-Control-Checks (IFCCs) and Channel-Control-Checks
(CCCs) or loss of High-Performance-FICON (HPF) functionality on one or
more of these paths.

If a channel path does not work correctly, it is removed from normal
operation as long as other channel paths are available. All extended
error recovery states can be queried and reset via user space
interfaces.
