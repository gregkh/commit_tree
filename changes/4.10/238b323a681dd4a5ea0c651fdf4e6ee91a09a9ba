libnvdimm, namespace: fix the type of name variable

In create_namespace_blk(), the local variable "name" is defined as an
array of NSLABEL_NAME_LEN pointers:

    char *name[NSLABEL_NAME_LEN];

This variable is then used in calls to memcpy() and kmemdup() as if it
were char[NSLABEL_NAME_LEN]. Remove the star in the variable definition
to makes it look right.
