btrfs: fix btrfs_compat_ioctl failures on non-compat ioctls

Commit 4c63c2454ef incorrectly assumed that returning -ENOIOCTLCMD would
cause the native ioctl to be called.  The ->compat_ioctl callback is
expected to handle all ioctls, not just compat variants.  As a result,
when using 32-bit userspace on 64-bit kernels, everything except those
three ioctls would return -ENOTTY.
