mtd: bcm47xxsflash: use uncached MMIO access for BCM53573

BCM53573 is a new series of Broadcom's SoCs. It's based on ARM and uses
this old ChipCommon-based flash access. Early tests resulted in flash
corruptions that were tracked down to using cached MMIO for flash read
access. Switch to ioremap_nocache conditionally to support BCM53573 and
don't break performance on old MIPS devices.
