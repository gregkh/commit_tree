seq_file: reset iterator to first record for zero offset

If kernfs file is empty on a first read, successive read operations
using the same file descriptor will return no data, even when data is
available. Default kernfs 'seq_next' implementation advances iterator
position even when next object is not there. Kernfs 'seq_start' for
following requests will not return iterator as position is already on
the second object.

This defect doesn't allow to monitor badblocks sysfs files from MD raid.
They are initially empty but if data appears at some stage, userspace is
not able to read it.
