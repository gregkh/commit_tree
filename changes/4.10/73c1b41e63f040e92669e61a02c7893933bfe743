cpu/hotplug: Cleanup state names

When the state names got added a script was used to add the extra argument
to the calls. The script basically converted the state constant to a
string, but the cleanup to convert these strings into meaningful ones did
not happen.

Replace all the useless strings with 'subsys/xxx/yyy:state' strings which
are used in all the other places already.
