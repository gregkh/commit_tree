drm/vc4: Fix termination of the initial scan for branch targets.

The loop is scanning until the original max_ip (size of the BO), but
we want to not examine any code after the PROG_END's delay slots.
There was a block trying to do that, except that we had some early
continue statements if the signal wasn't a PROG_END or a BRANCH.

The failure mode would be that a valid shader is rejected because some
undefined memory after the PROG_END slots is parsed as a branch and
the rest of its setup is illegal.  I haven't seen this in the wild,
but valgrind was complaining when about this up in the userland
simulator mode.
