iio: 104-quad-8: Add IIO support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8

The ACCES 104-QUAD-8 is a general purpose quadrature encoder
counter/interface board. The 104-QUAD-8 is capable of monitoring the
outputs of eight encoders via four on-board LSI/CSI LS7266R1 24-bit
dual-axis quadrature counter chips. Core functions handled by the
LS7266R1, such as direction and total count, are available.

Performing a write to a counter's IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW sets the counter and
also clears the counter's respective error flag. Although the counters
have a 25-bit range, only the lower 24 bits may be set, either directly
or via a counter's preset attribute. Interrupts are not supported by
this driver.

This driver adds IIO support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8 and ACCES
104-QUAD-4. The base port addresses for the devices may be configured
via the base array module parameter.
