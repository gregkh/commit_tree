coredump: Ensure proper size of sparse core files

If the last section of a core file ends with an unmapped or zero page,
the size of the file does not correspond with the last dump_skip() call.
gdb complains that the file is truncated and can be confusing to users.

After all of the vma sections are written, make sure that the file size
is no smaller than the current file position.

This problem can be demonstrated with gdb's bigcore testcase on the
sparc architecture.
