drm: Restrict stackdepot usage to builtin drm.ko

I misread the kbuild result thinking that we had missed the include
(which we had for completeness anyway), what kbuild was actually warning
me about was that depot_save_stack was not exported.

Temporarily fix this by only selecting STACKDEPOT iff drm.ko is builtin
