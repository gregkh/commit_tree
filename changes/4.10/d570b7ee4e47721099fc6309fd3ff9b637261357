mlxsw: Change trap set function

Change trap setting function so instead of determining the trap group by
trap id, it gets it as a parameter (so later we can have different trap
groups for Spectrum and Switchx2).
Add "is_ctrl" parameter to the trap setting function. It control whether
the trapped packets wait in a designated control buffer or in their
default one. This parameter is ignored by Switchx2 and Switchib.
Add these parameters to the traps array in Spectrum, Switchx2 and
Switchib.
