list: Split list_add() debug checking into separate function

Right now, __list_add() code is repeated either in list.h or in
list_debug.c, but the only differences between the two versions
are the debug checks. This commit therefore extracts these debug
checks into a separate __list_add_valid() function and consolidates
__list_add(). Additionally this new __list_add_valid() function will stop
list manipulations if a corruption is detected, instead of allowing for
further corruption that may lead to even worse conditions.

This is slight refactoring of the same hardening done in PaX and Grsecurity.
