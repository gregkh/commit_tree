rcu: Don't kick unless grace period or request

The current code can result in spurious kicks when there are no grace
periods in progress and no grace-period-related requests.  This is
sort of OK for a diagnostic aid, but the resulting ftrace-dump messages
in dmesg are annoying.  This commit therefore avoids spurious kicks
in the common case.
