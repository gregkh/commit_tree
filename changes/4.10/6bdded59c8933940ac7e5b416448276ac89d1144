fscache: Clear outstanding writes when disabling a cookie

fscache_disable_cookie() needs to clear the outstanding writes on the
cookie it's disabling because they cannot be completed after.

Without this, fscache_nfs_open_file() gets stuck because it disables the
cookie when the file is opened for writing but can't uncache the pages till
afterwards - otherwise there's a race between the open routine and anyone
who already has it open R/O and is still reading from it.

Looking in /proc/pid/stack of the offending process shows:
