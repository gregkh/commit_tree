crypto: testmgr - don't use stack buffer in test_acomp()

With virtually-mapped stacks (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y), using the
scatterlist crypto API with stack buffers is not allowed, and with
appropriate debugging options will cause the
'BUG_ON(!virt_addr_valid(buf));' in sg_set_buf() to be triggered.
Use a heap buffer instead.
