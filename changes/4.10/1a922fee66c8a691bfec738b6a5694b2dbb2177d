samples, bpf: Refactor test_current_task_under_cgroup - separate out helpers

This patch modifies test_current_task_under_cgroup_user. The test has
several helpers around creating a temporary environment for cgroup
testing, and moving the current task around cgroups. This set of
helpers can then be used in other tests.
