net: centralize net_device min/max MTU checking

While looking into an MTU issue with sfc, I started noticing that almost
every NIC driver with an ndo_change_mtu function implemented almost
exactly the same range checks, and in many cases, that was the only
practical thing their ndo_change_mtu function was doing. Quite a few
drivers have either 68, 64, 60 or 46 as their minimum MTU value checked,
and then various sizes from 1500 to 65535 for their maximum MTU value. We
can remove a whole lot of redundant code here if we simple store min_mtu
and max_mtu in net_device, and check against those in net/core/dev.c's
dev_set_mtu().

In theory, there should be zero functional change with this patch, it just
puts the infrastructure in place. Subsequent patches will attempt to start
using said infrastructure, with theoretically zero change in
functionality.
