Input: synaptics-rmi4 - allow to add attention data

The HID implementation of RMI4 provides the data during
the interrupt (in the input report). We need to provide
a way for this transport driver to provide the attention
data while calling an IRQ.

We use a fifo in rmi_core to not lose any incoming event.
