KVM: PPC: Book3S: Move prototypes for KVM functions into kvm_ppc.h

This moves the prototypes for functions that are only called from
assembler code out of asm/asm-prototypes.h into asm/kvm_ppc.h.
The prototypes were added in commit ebe4535fbe7a ("KVM: PPC:
Book3S HV: sparse: prototypes for functions called from assembler",
2016-10-10), but given that the functions are KVM functions,
having them in a KVM header will be better for long-term
maintenance.
