[media] drivers/media/media-device: fix double free bug in _unregister()

While removing all interfaces in media_device_unregister(), all
media_interface pointers are freed.  This is illegal and results in
double kfree() if any media_interface is still linked at this point;
maybe because a userspace process still has a file handle.  Once the
process closes the file handle, dvb_media_device_free() gets called,
which frees the dvb_device.intf_devnode again.

This patch removes the unnecessary kfree() call, and documents who's
responsible for really freeing it.
