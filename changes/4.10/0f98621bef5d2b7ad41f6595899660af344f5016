bpf, inode: add support for symlinks and fix mtime/ctime

While commit bb35a6ef7da4 ("bpf, inode: allow for rename and link ops")
added support for hard links that can be used for prog and map nodes,
this work adds simple symlink support, which can be used f.e. for
directories also when unpriviledged and works with cmdline tooling that
understands S_IFLNK anyway. Since the switch in e27f4a942a0e ("bpf: Use
mount_nodev not mount_ns to mount the bpf filesystem"), there can be
various mount instances with mount_nodev() and thus hierarchy can be
flattened to facilitate object sharing. Thus, we can keep bpf tooling
also working by repointing paths.

Most of the functionality can be used from vfs library operations. The
symlink is stored in the inode itself, that is in i_link, which is
sufficient in our case as opposed to storing it in the page cache.
While at it, I noticed that bpf_mkdir() and bpf_mkobj() don't update
the directories mtime and ctime, so add a common helper for it called
bpf_dentry_finalize() that takes care of it for all cases now.
