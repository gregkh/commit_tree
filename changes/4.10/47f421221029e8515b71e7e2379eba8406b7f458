Documentation: atomic_ops: use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE()

While the {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() macros should be used in preference to
ACCESS_ONCE(), the atomic documentation uses the latter exclusively.

To point people in the right direction, and as a step towards the
eventual removal of ACCESS_ONCE(), update the documentation to use the
{READ,WRITE}_ONCE() macros as appropriate.
