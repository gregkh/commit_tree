dm flakey: introduce "error_writes" feature

Recent dm-flakey fixes, to have reads error out during the "down"
interval, made it so that the previous read behaviour is no longer
available.

It is useful to have reads complete like normal but have writes error
out, so make it possible again with a new "error_writes" feature.
