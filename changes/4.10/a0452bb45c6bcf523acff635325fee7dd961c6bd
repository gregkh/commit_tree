scsi: libfc: spurious I/O error under high load

If a command times out libfc is sending an REC, which also
might fail (due to frames being lost or something).
If no data has been transferred we can simply retry
the command, but the current code sets a state of FC_ERROR,
which then is being translated into DID_ERROR, resulting
in an I/O error.
So to handle this properly we need to set a separate
state FC_TRANS_RESET and mapping it onto DID_SOFT_RETRY.
