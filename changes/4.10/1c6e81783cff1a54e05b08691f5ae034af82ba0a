[media] media: ti-vpe: Make scaler library into its own module

In preparation to add scaler support into VIP we need to
turn sc.c into its own kernel module.

Add support for multiple SC memory block as VIP contains
2 scaler instances.
This is done by passing the resource name to sc_create() and
modify the vpe invocation accordingly.
