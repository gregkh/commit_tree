bpf: remove type arg from __is_valid_{,xdp_}access

Commit d691f9e8d440 ("bpf: allow programs to write to certain skb
fields") pushed access type check outside of __is_valid_access()
to have different restrictions for socket filters and tc programs.
type is thus not used anymore within __is_valid_access() and should
be removed as a function argument. Same for __is_valid_xdp_access()
introduced by 6a773a15a1e8 ("bpf: add XDP prog type for early driver
filter").
