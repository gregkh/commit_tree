vfs: fix uninitialized flags in splice_to_pipe()

Flags (PIPE_BUF_FLAG_PACKET, PIPE_BUF_FLAG_GIFT) could remain on the
unused part of the pipe ring buffer.  Previously splice_to_pipe() left
the flags value alone, which could result in incorrect behavior.

Uninitialized flags appears to have been there from the introduction of
the splice syscall.
