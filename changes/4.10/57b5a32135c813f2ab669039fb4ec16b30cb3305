dmaengine: stm32-dma: Fix null pointer dereference in stm32_dma_tx_status

chan->desc is always set to NULL when a DMA transfer is complete.
As a DMA transfer could be complete during the call of stm32_dma_tx_status,
we need to be sure that chan->desc is not NULL before using this variable
to avoid a null pointer deference issue.
