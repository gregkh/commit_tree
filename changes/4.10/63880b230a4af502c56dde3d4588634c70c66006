PCI: Ignore BAR updates on virtual functions

VF BARs are read-only zero, so updating VF BARs will not have any effect.
See the SR-IOV spec r1.1, sec 3.4.1.11.

We already ignore these updates because of 70675e0b6a1a ("PCI: Don't try to
restore VF BARs"); this merely restructures it slightly to make it easier
to split updates for standard and SR-IOV BARs.
