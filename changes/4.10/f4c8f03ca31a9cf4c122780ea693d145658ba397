usb: xhci: clean up error_bitmask usage

In xhci_handle_event(), when errors are detected, driver always sets
a bit in error_bitmask (one member of the xhci private driver data).
That means users have to retrieve and decode the value of error_bitmask
in xhci private driver data if they want to know whether those erros
ever happened in xhci_handle_event(). Otherwise, those errors are just
ignored silently.

This patch cleans up this by replacing the setting of error_bitmask
with the kernel print functions, so that users can easily check and
report the errors happened in xhci_handle_event().
