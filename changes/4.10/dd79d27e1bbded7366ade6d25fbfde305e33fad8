[media] dvb-core: get rid of demux optional circular buffer

There is a provision at the dvb_demux.c to use a vmalloc'ed
circular buffer, enabled via an extra #ifdef option that it
is not at Kconfig. Enabling it will only make the Kernel to
allocate/deallocate such buffer, but no code would actually
use it. So, no practical effect, except for sparing some
memory without any good reason.

So, get rid of such dead code.
