dmaengine: qcom_hidma: make pending_tre_count atomic

Getting ready for the MSI interrupts. The pending_tre_count is used
in the interrupt handler to make sure all outstanding requests are
serviced.

The driver will allocate 11 MSI interrupts. Each MSI interrupt can be
assigned to a different CPU. Then, we have a race condition for common
variables as they share the same interrupt handler with a different
cause bit and they can potentially be executed in parallel. Making this
variable atomic so that it can be updated from multiple processor
contexts.
