blk-mq: implement hybrid poll mode for sync O_DIRECT

This patch enables a hybrid polling mode. Instead of polling after IO
submission, we can induce an artificial delay, and then poll after that.
For example, if the IO is presumed to complete in 8 usecs from now, we
can sleep for 4 usecs, wake up, and then do our polling. This still puts
a sleep/wakeup cycle in the IO path, but instead of the wakeup happening
after the IO has completed, it'll happen before. With this hybrid
scheme, we can achieve big latency reductions while still using the same
(or less) amount of CPU.
