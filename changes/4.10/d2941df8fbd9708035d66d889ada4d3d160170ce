mac80211: recalculate min channel width on VHT opmode changes

When an associated station changes its VHT operating mode this
can/will affect the bandwidth it's using, and consequently we
must recalculate the minimum bandwidth we need to use. Failure
to do so can lead to one of two scenarios:
 1) we use a too high bandwidth, this is benign
 2) we use a too narrow bandwidth, causing rate control and
    actual PHY configuration to be out of sync, which can in
    turn cause problems/crashes
