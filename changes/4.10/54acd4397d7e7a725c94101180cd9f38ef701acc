rculist: Consolidate DEBUG_LIST for list_add_rcu()

This commit consolidates the debug checking for list_add_rcu() into the
new single __list_add_valid() debug function.  Notably, this commit fixes
the sanity check that was added in commit 17a801f4bfeb ("list_debug:
WARN for adding something already in the list"), which wasn't checking
RCU-protected lists.
