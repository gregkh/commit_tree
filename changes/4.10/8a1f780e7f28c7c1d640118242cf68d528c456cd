memory_hotplug: make zone_can_shift() return a boolean value

online_{kernel|movable} is used to change the memory zone to
ZONE_{NORMAL|MOVABLE} and online the memory.

To check that memory zone can be changed, zone_can_shift() is used.
Currently the function returns minus integer value, plus integer
value and 0. When the function returns minus or plus integer value,
it means that the memory zone can be changed to ZONE_{NORNAL|MOVABLE}.

But when the function returns 0, there are two meanings.

One of the meanings is that the memory zone does not need to be changed.
For example, when memory is in ZONE_NORMAL and onlined by online_kernel
the memory zone does not need to be changed.

Another meaning is that the memory zone cannot be changed. When memory
is in ZONE_NORMAL and onlined by online_movable, the memory zone may
not be changed to ZONE_MOVALBE due to memory online limitation(see
Documentation/memory-hotplug.txt). In this case, memory must not be
onlined.

The patch changes the return type of zone_can_shift() so that memory
online operation fails when memory zone cannot be changed as follows:

Before applying patch:
   # grep -A 35 "Node 2" /proc/zoneinfo
   Node 2, zone   Normal
   <snip>
      node_scanned  0
           spanned  8388608
           present  7864320
           managed  7864320
   # echo online_movable > memory4097/state
   # grep -A 35 "Node 2" /proc/zoneinfo
   Node 2, zone   Normal
   <snip>
      node_scanned  0
           spanned  8388608
           present  8388608
           managed  8388608

   online_movable operation succeeded. But memory is onlined as
   ZONE_NORMAL, not ZONE_MOVABLE.

After applying patch:
   # grep -A 35 "Node 2" /proc/zoneinfo
   Node 2, zone   Normal
   <snip>
      node_scanned  0
           spanned  8388608
           present  7864320
           managed  7864320
   # echo online_movable > memory4097/state
   bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
   # grep -A 35 "Node 2" /proc/zoneinfo
   Node 2, zone   Normal
   <snip>
      node_scanned  0
           spanned  8388608
           present  7864320
           managed  7864320

   online_movable operation failed because of failure of changing
   the memory zone from ZONE_NORMAL to ZONE_MOVABLE
