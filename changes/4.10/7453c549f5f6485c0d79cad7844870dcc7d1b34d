swiotlb: Export swiotlb_max_segment to users

So they can figure out what is the optimal number of pages
that can be contingously stitched together without fear of
bounce buffer.

We also expose an mechanism for sub-users of SWIOTLB API, such
as Xen-SWIOTLB to set the max segment value. And lastly
if swiotlb=force is set (which mandates we bounce buffer everything)
we set max_segment so at least we can bounce buffer one 4K page
instead of a giant 512KB one for which we may not have space.
