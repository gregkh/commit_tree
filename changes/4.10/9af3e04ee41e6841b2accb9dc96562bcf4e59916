s390/zcrypt: get rid of ap_poll_requests

The poll thread of the AP bus is burning CPU while waiting for
crypto requests to complete. We can as well burn a few more cycles
in the poll thread to check if there are pending requests and
remove the atomic operations with the ap_poll_requests.
This improves the code if the machine has adapter interrupts.
