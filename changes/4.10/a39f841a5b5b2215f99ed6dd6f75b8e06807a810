coresight: etm3x: Adding missing features of Coresight PTM components

In the current driver for Coresight components, two features of PTM
components are missing:

1. Branch Broadcasting (present also in ETM but called Branch Output)
2. Return Stack (only present in PTM v1.0 and PTMv1.1)

These features can be added simply to the code using `mode` field of
`etm_config` struct.

1. **Branch Broadcast** : The branch broadcast feature is present in ETM
components as well and is called Branch output. It allows to retrieve
addresses for direct branch addresses alongside the indirect branch
addresses. For example, it could be useful in cases when tracing without
source code.
2. **Return Stack** : The return stack option allows to retrieve the
return addresses of function calls. It can be useful to avoid CRA
(Code Reuse Attacks) by keeping a shadowstack.
