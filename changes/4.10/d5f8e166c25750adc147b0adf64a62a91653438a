mei: request async autosuspend at the end of enumeration

pm_runtime_autosuspend can take synchronous or asynchronous
paths, Because we are calling pm_runtime_mark_last_busy just before
this most of the cases it takes the asynchronous way. However,
when the FW or driver resets during already running runtime suspend,
the call will result in calling to the driver's rpm callback and results
in a deadlock on device_lock.
The simplest fix is to replace pm_runtime_autosuspend with
asynchronous pm_request_autosuspend.
