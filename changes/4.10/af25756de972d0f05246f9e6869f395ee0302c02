scsi: dpt_i2o: double free on error path

We recently introduced a kfree() in the caller for this function.
That's where, logically, you would think the kfree() should be.
Unfortunately the code was just ugly and not buggy so the static checker
warning was a false postive and introduced a double free.

I've removed the old kfree() and left the new one.
