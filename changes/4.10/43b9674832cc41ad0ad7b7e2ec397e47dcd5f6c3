md/raid5-cache: adjust the write position of the empty block if no data blocks

When recovery is complete, we write an empty block and record his
position first, then make the data-only stripes rewritten done,
the location of the empty block as the last checkpoint position
to write into the super block. And we should update last_checkpoint
to this empty block position.

------------------------------------------------------------------
|  old log       | empty block | data only stripes | invalid log |
------------------------------------------------------------------
^                ^                                 ^
|                |- log->last_checkpoint           |- log->log_start
|                |- log->last_cp_seq               |- log->next_checkpoint
|- log->seq=n    |- log->seq=10+n

At the same time, if there is no data-only stripes, this scene may appear,
| meta1 | meta2 | meta3 |
meta 1 is valid, meta 2 is invalid. meta 3 could be valid. so we should
The solution is we create a new meta in meta2 with its seq == meta1's
seq + 10 and let superblock points to meta2.
