scsi: ibmvscsis: Synchronize cmds at tpg_enable_store time

This patch changes the way the IBM vSCSI server driver manages its
Command/Response Queue (CRQ).  We used to register the CRQ with phyp at
probe time.  Now we wait until tpg_enable_store.  Similarly, when
tpg_enable_store is called to "disable" (i.e. the stored value is 0),
we unregister the queue with phyp.

One consquence to this is that we have no need for the PART_UP_WAIT_ENAB
state, since we can't get an Init Message from the client in our CRQ if
we're waiting to be enabled, since we haven't registered the queue yet.
