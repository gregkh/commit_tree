netfilter: nf_tables: simplify the basic expressions' init routine

Some basic expressions are built into nf_tables.ko, such as nft_cmp,
nft_lookup, nft_range and so on. But these basic expressions' init
routine is a little ugly, too many goto errX labels, and we forget
to call nft_range_module_exit in the exit routine, although it is
harmless.

Acctually, the init and exit routines of these basic expressions
are same, i.e. do nft_register_expr in the init routine and do
nft_unregister_expr in the exit routine.

So it's better to arrange them into an array and deal with them
together.
