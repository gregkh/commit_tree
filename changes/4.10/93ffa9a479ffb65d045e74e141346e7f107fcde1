x86/init: Add i8042 state to the platform data

Add i8042 state to the platform data to help i8042 driver make decision
whether to probe for i8042 or not. We recognize 3 states: platform/subarch
ca not possible have i8042 (as is the case with Inrel MID platform),
firmware (such as ACPI) reports that i8042 is absent from the device,
or i8042 may be present and the driver should probe for it.

The intent is to allow i8042 driver abort initialization on x86 if PNP data
(absence of both keyboard and mouse PNP devices) agrees with firmware data.

It will also allow us to remove i8042_detect later.
