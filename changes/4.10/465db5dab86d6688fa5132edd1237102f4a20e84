Revert "net/mlx5e: Expose PCIe statistics to ethtool"

This reverts commit 9c7262399ba12825f3ca4b00a76d8d5e77c720f5.
PCIe counters were introduced in a new firmware version, as a result users
with old firmware encountered a syndrome every 200ms due to update stats
work. This feature will be re-introduced later with appropriate capabilities
infrastructure.
