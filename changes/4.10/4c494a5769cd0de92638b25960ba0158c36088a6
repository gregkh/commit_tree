drm/i915: Fix mismatched INIT power domain disabling during suspend

Currently the display INIT power domain disabling/enabling happens in a
mismatched way in the suspend/resume_early hooks respectively. This can
leave display power wells incorrectly disabled in the resume hook if the
suspend sequence is aborted for some reason resulting in the
suspend/resume hooks getting called but the suspend_late/resume_early
hooks being skipped. In particular this change fixes "Unclaimed read
from register 0x1e1204" on BYT/BSW triggered from i915_drm_resume()->
intel_pps_unlock_regs_wa() when suspending with /sys/power/pm_test set
to devices.
