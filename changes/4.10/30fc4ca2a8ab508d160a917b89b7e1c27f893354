s390/topology: use cpu_topology array instead of per cpu variable

CPU topology information like cpu to node mapping must be setup in
setup_arch already. Topology information is currently made available
with a per cpu variable; this however will not work when the
initialization will be moved to setup_arch, since the generic percpu
setup will be done much later.

Therefore convert back to a cpu_topology array.
