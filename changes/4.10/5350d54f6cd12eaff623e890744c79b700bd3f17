ipv4: Do not allow MAIN to be alias for new LOCAL w/ custom rules

In the case of custom rules being present we need to handle the case of the
LOCAL table being intialized after the new rule has been added.  To address
that I am adding a new check so that we can make certain we don't use an
alias of MAIN for LOCAL when allocating a new table.
