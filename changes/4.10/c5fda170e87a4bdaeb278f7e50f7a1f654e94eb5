pinctrl: sunxi: Add support for fetching pinconf settings from hardware

The sunxi pinctrl driver only caches whatever pinconf setting was last
set on a given pingroup. This is not particularly helpful, nor is it
correct.

Fix this by actually reading the hardware registers and returning
the correct results or error codes. Also filter out unsupported
pinconf settings. Since this driver has a peculiar setup of 1 pin
per group, we can support both pin and pingroup pinconf setting
read back with the same code. The sunxi_pconf_reg helper and code
structure is inspired by pinctrl-msm.

With this done we can also claim to support generic pinconf, by
setting .is_generic = true in pinconf_ops.

Also remove the cached config value. The behavior of this was never
correct, as it only cached 1 setting instead of all of them. Since
we can now read back settings directly from the hardware, it is no
longer required.
