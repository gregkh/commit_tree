x86/tsc: Mark TSC frequency determined by CPUID as known

CPUs/SoCs with CPUID leaf 0x15 come with a known frequency and will report
the frequency to software via CPUID instruction. This hardware provided
frequency is the "real" frequency of TSC.

Set the X86_FEATURE_TSC_KNOWN_FREQ flag for such systems to skip the
software calibration process.

A 24 hours test on one of the CPUID 0x15 capable platforms was
conducted. PIT calibrated frequency resulted in more than 3 seconds drift
whereas the CPUID determined frequency showed less than 0.5 second
drift.
