base: soc: Early register bus when needed

If soc_device_register() is called before soc_bus_register(), it crashes
with a NULL pointer dereference.

soc_bus_register() is already a core_initcall(), but drivers/base/ is
entered later than e.g. drivers/pinctrl/ and drivers/soc/. Hence there
are several subsystems that may need to know SoC revision information,
while it's not so easy to initialize the SoC bus even earlier using an
initcall.

To fix this, let soc_device_register() register the bus early if that
hasn't happened yet.
