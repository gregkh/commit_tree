drm/i915: Avoid early GPU idling due to race with new request

There is a small race where a new request can be submitted and retired
after the idle worker started to run which leads to idling the GPU too
early. Fix this by deferring the idling to the pending instance of the
worker.

This scenario was pointed out by Chris.
