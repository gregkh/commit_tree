scsi: ufs: issue link starup 2 times if device isn't active

If we issue the link startup to the device while its UniPro state is
LinkDown (and device state is sleep/power-down) then link startup
will not move the device state to Active. Device will only move to
active state if the link starup is issued when its UniPro state is
LinkUp. So in this case, we would have to issue the link startup 2
times to make sure that device moves to active state.
