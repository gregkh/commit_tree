mwifiex: Fix NULL pointer dereference in skb_dequeue()

At couple of places in cleanup path, we are just going through the
skb queue and freeing them without unlinking. This leads to a crash
when other thread tries to do skb_dequeue() and use already freed node.

The problem is freed by unlinking skb before freeing it.
