ath10k: fix Tx DMA alloc failure during continuous wifi down/up

With maximum number of vap's configured in a two radio supported
systems of ~256 Mb RAM, doing a continuous wifi down/up and
intermittent traffic streaming from the connected stations results
in failure to allocate contiguous memory for tx buffers. This results
in the disappearance of all VAP's and a manual reboot is needed as
this is not a crash (or) OOM(for OOM killer to be invoked). To address
this allocate contiguous memory for tx buffers one time and re-use them
until the modules are unloaded but this results in a slight increase in
memory footprint of ath10k when the wifi is down, but the modules are
still loaded. Also as of now we use a separate bool 'tx_mem_allocated'
to keep track of the one time memory allocation, as we cannot come up
with something like 'ath10k_tx_{register,unregister}' before
'ath10k_probe_fw' is called as 'ath10k_htt_tx_alloc_cont_frag_desc'
memory allocation is dependent on the hw_param 'continuous_frag_desc'

a) memory footprint of ath10k without the change

lsmod | grep ath10k
ath10k_core           414498  1 ath10k_pci
ath10k_pci             38236  0

b) memory footprint of ath10k with the change

ath10k_core           414980  1 ath10k_pci
ath10k_pci             38236  0
