staging: lustre: clio: revise read ahead algorithm

ras_window_len should only be updated in ras_update() by read
pattern and it can't be adjusted in ll_readahead() at all;
ras_consecutive_pages is used to detect read pattern from
mmap. It will be used to increase read ahead window length
gradually.
