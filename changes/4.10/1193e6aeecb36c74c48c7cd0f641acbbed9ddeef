KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Fix deadlock on error handling

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the syzkaller fuzzer triggered a
deadlock in the vgic setup code when an error was detected, as
the cleanup code tries to take a lock that is already held by
the setup code.

The fix is to avoid retaking the lock when cleaning up, by
telling the cleanup function that we already hold it.
