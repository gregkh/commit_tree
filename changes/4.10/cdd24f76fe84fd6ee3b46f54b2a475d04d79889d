reset: lpc18xx: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/reset/Kconfig:config RESET_LPC18XX
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  bool "LPC18xx/43xx Reset Driver" if COMPILE_TEST
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  default ARCH_LPC18XX

or

arch/arm/Kconfig:config ARCH_LPC18XX
arch/arm/Kconfig:       bool "NXP LPC18xx/LPC43xx"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
