PCI: Add comments about ROM BAR updating

pci_update_resource() updates a hardware BAR so its address matches the
kernel's struct resource UNLESS it's a disabled ROM BAR.  We only update
those when we enable the ROM.

It's not obvious from the code why ROM BARs should be handled specially.
Apparently there are Matrox devices with defective ROM BARs that read as
zero when disabled.  That means that if pci_enable_rom() reads the disabled
BAR, sets PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE (without re-inserting the address), and
writes it back, it would enable the ROM at address zero.

Add comments and references to explain why we can't make the code look more
rational.

The code changes are from 755528c860b0 ("Ignore disabled ROM resources at
setup") and 8085ce084c0f ("[PATCH] Fix PCI ROM mapping").
