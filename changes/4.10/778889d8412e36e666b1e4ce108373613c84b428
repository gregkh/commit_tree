block: apply blk_partition_remap to REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET

If a ZBC device is partitioned and operations are performed on the partition
the zone information is rebased to the partition, however the zone reset
is not mapped from the partition to device as are other operations.

This causes the API (report zones / reset zone) to be unbalanced in this
regard. Checking for the zone reset op code explicitly will balance the
API.
