scsi: scsi_transport_fc: Hold queue lock while calling blk_run_queue_async()

It is required to hold the queue lock when calling blk_run_queue_async()
to avoid that a race between blk_run_queue_async() and
blk_cleanup_queue() is triggered. Additionally, remove the get_device()
and put_device() calls from fc_bsg_goose_queue. It is namely the
responsibility of the caller of fc_bsg_goose_queue() to ensure that the
bsg queue does not disappear while fc_bsg_goose_queue() is in progress.
