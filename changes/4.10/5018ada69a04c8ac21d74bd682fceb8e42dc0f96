gpio: Move freeing of GPIO hogs before numbing of the device

When removing a gpiochip that uses GPIO hogging (e.g. by unloading the
chip's DT overlay), a warning is printed:

    gpio gpiochip8: REMOVING GPIOCHIP WITH GPIOS STILL REQUESTED

This happens because gpiochip_free_hogs() is called after the gdev->chip
pointer is reset to NULL. Hence __gpiod_free() cannot determine the
chip in use, and cannot clear flags nor call the optional chip-specific
.free() callback.

Move the call to gpiochip_free_hogs() up to fix this.
