The syzkaller folks reported a NULL pointer dereference that due to
unregister an consumer which fails registration before. The syzkaller
creates two VMs w/ an equal eventfd occasionally. So the second VM
fails to register an irqbypass consumer. It will make irqfd as inactive
and queue an workqueue work to shutdown irqfd and unregister the irqbypass
consumer when eventfd is closed. However, the second consumer has been
initialized though it fails registration. So the token(same as the first
VM's) is taken to unregister the consumer through the workqueue, the
consumer of the first VM is found and unregistered, then NULL deref incurred
in the path of deleting consumer from the consumers list.

This patch fixes it by making irq_bypass_register/unregister_consumer()
looks for the consumer entry based on consumer pointer itself instead of
token matching.
