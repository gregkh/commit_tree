staging: lustre: ptlrpc: Do not resend req with allow_replay

If the request is allowed to be sent during recovery,
and it is not timeout yet, then we do not need to
resend it in the final stage of recovery.

Unnecessary resend will cause the bulk request to resend the
request with different mbit, but same xid, and on the remote
server side, it will drop such request with same xid, so it
will never get the bulk in this case.
