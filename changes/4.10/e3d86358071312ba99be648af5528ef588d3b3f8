staging: lustre: mgc: MGC should retry for invalid import

After http://review.whamcloud.com/#/c/9967/ is landed, mgc does
not wait the import connected(state = FULL), then enqueue and
retrieve config log, which will cause the mount process to fail,
especially if the mgc is shared by multiple targets.
So once mgc enqueue is failed, it will give another chance to
wait the import to recover, if the import comes back in time,
it will try to enqueue again. Otherwise it will use local config log.
