s390: fix initrd corruptions with gcov/kcov instrumented kernels

The early C code within arch/s390/kernel/early.c saves ipl parameters
before the bss section is cleared. When doing that it jumps to code
that is potentially gcov/kcov instrumented. That code in turn will
corrupt an initrd that potentially may reside in the not yet ready to
be used bss section.

Instead of excluding more and more code from gcov/kcov instrumentation
provide an early memmove function which will be used to save ipl
parameters. The verification if these parameters are actually valid
will be done later.
