staging: lustre: statahead: set sai_index_wait with lli_sa_lock held

It is the sponsor thread of the statahead thread to update the
sai::sai_index_wait. Originally, it didn't hold the lli_sa_lock
when did that. Becuase of out-of-order execution others may miss
to wakeup such thread.

On the other hand, if the statahead RPC gets failure, it should
wakeup the sponsor thread, not the statahead thread.
