powerpc/32: Change the stack protector canary value per task

Partially copied from commit df0698be14c66 ("ARM: stack protector:
change the canary value per task")

A new random value for the canary is stored in the task struct whenever
a new task is forked.  This is meant to allow for different canary values
per task.  On powerpc, GCC expects the canary value to be found in a global
variable called __stack_chk_guard.  So this variable has to be updated
with the value stored in the task struct whenever a task switch occurs.

Because the variable GCC expects is global, this cannot work on SMP
unfortunately.  So, on SMP, the same initial canary value is kept
throughout, making this feature a bit less effective although it is still
useful.
