mmc: sdhci-acpi: support 80860F14 UID 2 SDIO bus

Add an entry for the SDIO bus in the ECS EF20 cherry trail laptop:

  Device (SDHB) {
    Name (_ADR, 0x00110000)
    Name (_HID, "80860F14" /* Intel Baytrail SDIO/MMC Host Controller */)
    Name (_CID, "PNP0D40" /* SDA Standard Compliant SD Host Controller */)
    Name (_DDN, "Intel(R) SDIO Controller - 80862295")

A SDHB device with the same _HID and _UID can also be found on other
cherry trail products like Chuwi Hi10.
