x86/PCI: Ignore _CRS on Supermicro X8DTH-i/6/iF/6F

Martin reported that the Supermicro X8DTH-i/6/iF/6F advertises incorrect
host bridge windows via _CRS:

  pci_root PNP0A08:00: host bridge window [io  0xf000-0xffff]
  pci_root PNP0A08:01: host bridge window [io  0xf000-0xffff]

Both bridges advertise the 0xf000-0xffff window, which cannot be correct.

Work around this by ignoring _CRS on this system.  The downside is that we
may not assign resources correctly to hot-added PCI devices (if they are
possible on this system).
