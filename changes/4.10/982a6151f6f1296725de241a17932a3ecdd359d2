ath9k_htc: don't use HZ for usb msg timeouts

The usb_*_msg() functions expect a timeout in msecs but are given HZ,
which is ticks per second. If HZ=100, firmware download often times out
when there is modest USB utilization and the device fails to initialize.

Replaces HZ in usb_*_msg timeouts with 1000 msec since HZ is one second
for timeouts in jiffies.
