swiotlb: ensure that page-sized mappings are page-aligned

Some drivers do depend on page mappings to be page aligned.

Swiotlb already enforces such alignment for mappings greater than page,
extend that to page-sized mappings as well.

Without this fix, nvme hits BUG() in nvme_setup_prps(), because that routine
assumes page-aligned mappings.
