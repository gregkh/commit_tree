ASoC: pxa: Make static string arrays 'const 'char * const []'

const char * const [] is the preferred type for static string arrays since
this states explicitly that the individual entries are not going to be
changed. Due to limitations in the ASoC API it was not possible to use it
for enum text arrays. Commit 87023ff74 ('ASoC: Declare const properly for
enum texts') changed this, but most drivers still use 'const char
* []' as the type for their enum text arrays.

Change these occurrences of 'static * const char * []' to 'static const
char * const []'.

The conversion was done automatically using the following coccinelle semantic
patch:
// <smpl>
@disable optional_qualifier@
identifier s;
@@
 static
-const char *
+const char * const
 s[] = ...;
// </smpl>
