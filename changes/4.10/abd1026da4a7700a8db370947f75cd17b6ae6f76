hv: acquire vmbus_connection.channel_mutex in vmbus_free_channels()

"kernel BUG at drivers/hv/channel_mgmt.c:350!" is observed when hv_vmbus
module is unloaded. BUG_ON() was introduced in commit 85d9aa705184
("Drivers: hv: vmbus: add an API vmbus_hvsock_device_unregister()") as
vmbus_free_channels() codepath was apparently forgotten.

Fixes: 85d9aa705184 ("Drivers: hv: vmbus: add an API vmbus_hvsock_device_unregister()")
