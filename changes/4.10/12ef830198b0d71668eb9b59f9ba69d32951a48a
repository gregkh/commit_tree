xfs: don't rely on ->total in xfs_alloc_space_available

->total is a bit of an odd parameter passed down to the low-level
allocator all the way from the high-level callers.  It's supposed to
contain the maximum number of blocks to be allocated for the whole
transaction [1].

But in xfs_iomap_write_allocate we only convert existing delayed
allocations and thus only have a minimal block reservation for the
current transaction, so xfs_alloc_space_available can't use it for
the allocation decisions.  Use the maximum of args->total and the
calculated block requirement to make a decision.  We probably should
get rid of args->total eventually and instead apply ->minleft more
broadly, but that will require some extensive changes all over.

[1] which creates lots of confusion as most callers don't decrement it
once doing a first allocation.  But that's for a separate series.
