tracing: Add error checks to creation of event files

The creation of the set_event_pid file was assigned to a variable "entry"
but that variable was never used. Ideally, it should be used to check if the
file was created and warn if it was not.

The files header_page, header_event should also be checked and a warning if
they fail to be created.

The "enable" file was moved up, as it is a more crucial file to have and a
hard failure (return -ENOMEM) should be returned if it is not created.
