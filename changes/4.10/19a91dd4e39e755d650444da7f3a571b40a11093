MMC: meson: avoid possible NULL dereference

No actual segmentation faults were observed but the coding is
at least inconsistent.

irqreturn_t meson_mmc_irq():

We should not dereference host before checking it.

meson_mmc_irq_thread():

If cmd or mrq are NULL we should not dereference them after
writing a warning.
