NFSv4: Add encode/decode of the layoutreturn op in OPEN_DOWNGRADE

While we do not need to return the RW layout when downgrading from a
read/write open state to read-only, we might want to do so in order
to reduce the burden on the metadataserver so that it does not need
to check for changed data when responding to GETATTR requests.
