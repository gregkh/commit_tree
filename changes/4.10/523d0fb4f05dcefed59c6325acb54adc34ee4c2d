x86/percpu: Remove unnecessary include of module.h, add asm/desc.h

This was originally a part of commit 186f43608a5c:

    ("x86/kernel: Audit and remove any unnecessary uses of module.h")

...but without the asm/desc.h addition.  As such, Ingo reported a
build failure on i386 allnoconfig with SMP=y during his pre-merge
testing.   For expediency the chunk was just dropped at that time.

The failure was as follows:

  arch/x86/kernel/setup_percpu.c: In function ‘setup_percpu_segment’:
  arch/x86/kernel/setup_percpu.c:159:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘pack_descriptor’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  arch/x86/kernel/setup_percpu.c:162:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘write_gdt_entry’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  arch/x86/kernel/setup_percpu.c:162:18: error: implicit declaration of function ‘get_cpu_gdt_table’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

As pack_descriptor(), write_gdt_entry() and get_cpu_gdt_table() all
live in the file arch/x86/include/asm/desc.h -- calling that header
out explicitly should fix things.
