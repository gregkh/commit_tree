mm, thp: avoid unlikely branches for split_huge_pmd

While doing MADV_DONTNEED on a large area of thp memory, I noticed we
encountered many unlikely() branches in profiles for each backing
hugepage.  This is because zap_pmd_range() would call split_huge_pmd(),
which rechecked the conditions that were already validated, but as part
of an unlikely() branch.

Avoid the unlikely() branch when in a context where pmd is known to be
good for __split_huge_pmd() directly.
