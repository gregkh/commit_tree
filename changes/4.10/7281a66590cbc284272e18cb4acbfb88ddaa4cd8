net: allow to kill a task which waits net_mutex in copy_new_ns

net_mutex can be locked for a long time. It may be because many
namespaces are being destroyed or many processes decide to create
a network namespace.

Both these operations are heavy, so it is better to have an ability to
kill a process which is waiting net_mutex.
