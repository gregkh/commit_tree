radix tree test suite: make runs more reproducible

Instead of reseeding the random number generator every time around the
loop in big_gang_check(), seed it at the beginning of execution.  Use
rand_r() and an independent base seed for each thread in
iteration_test() so they don't stomp all over each others state.  Since
this particular test depends on the kernel scheduler, the iteration test
can't be reproduced based purely on the random seed, but at least it
won't pollute the other tests.

Print the seed, and allow the seed to be specified so that a run which
hits a problem can be reproduced.
