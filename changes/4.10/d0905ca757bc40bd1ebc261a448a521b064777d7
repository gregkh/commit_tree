target/user: Fix use-after-free of tcmu_cmds if they are expired

Don't free the cmd in tcmu_check_expired_cmd, it's still referenced by
an entry in our cmd_id->cmd idr. If userspace ever resumes processing,
tcmu_handle_completions() will use the now-invalid cmd pointer.

Instead, don't free cmd. It will be freed by tcmu_handle_completion() if
userspace ever recovers, or tcmu_free_device if not.
