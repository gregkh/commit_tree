perf jit: Remove unecessary padding in jitdump file

This patch removes all the string padding generated in the jitdump file.
They are not necessary and were adding unnecessary complexity. Modern
processors can handle unaligned accesses quite well. The perf.data/
jitdump file are always post-processed, no need to add extra complexity
for no real gain.
