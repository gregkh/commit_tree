dm space map metadata: fix 'struct sm_metadata' leak on failed create

In dm_sm_metadata_create() we temporarily change the dm_space_map
operations from 'ops' (whose .destroy function deallocates the
sm_metadata) to 'bootstrap_ops' (whose .destroy function doesn't).

If dm_sm_metadata_create() fails in sm_ll_new_metadata() or
sm_ll_extend(), it exits back to dm_tm_create_internal(), which calls
dm_sm_destroy() with the intention of freeing the sm_metadata, but it
doesn't (because the dm_space_map operations is still set to
'bootstrap_ops').

Fix this by setting the dm_space_map operations back to 'ops' if
dm_sm_metadata_create() fails when it is set to 'bootstrap_ops'.
