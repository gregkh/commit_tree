selinux: Clean up initialization of isec->sclass

Now that isec->initialized == LABEL_INITIALIZED implies that
isec->sclass is valid, skip such inodes immediately in
inode_doinit_with_dentry.

For the remaining inodes, initialize isec->sclass at the beginning of
inode_doinit_with_dentry to simplify the code.
