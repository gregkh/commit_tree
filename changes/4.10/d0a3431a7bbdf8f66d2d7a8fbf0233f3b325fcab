crypto: arm/crc32 - accelerated support based on x86 SSE implementation

This is a combination of the the Intel algorithm implemented using SSE
and PCLMULQDQ instructions from arch/x86/crypto/crc32-pclmul_asm.S, and
the new CRC32 extensions introduced for both 32-bit and 64-bit ARM in
version 8 of the architecture. Two versions of the above combo are
provided, one for CRC32 and one for CRC32C.

The PMULL/NEON algorithm is faster, but operates on blocks of at least
64 bytes, and on multiples of 16 bytes only. For the remaining input,
or for all input on systems that lack the PMULL 64x64->128 instructions,
the CRC32 instructions will be used.
