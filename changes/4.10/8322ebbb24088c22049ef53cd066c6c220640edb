KVM: nVMX: generate MSR_IA32_CR{0,4}_FIXED1 from guest CPUID

MSR_IA32_CR{0,4}_FIXED1 define which bits in CR0 and CR4 are allowed to
be 1 during VMX operation. Since the set of allowed-1 bits is the same
in and out of VMX operation, we can generate these MSRs entirely from
the guest's CPUID. This lets userspace avoiding having to save/restore
these MSRs.

This patch also initializes MSR_IA32_CR{0,4}_FIXED1 from the CPU's MSRs
by default. This is a saner than the current default of -1ull, which
includes bits that the host CPU does not support.
