scsi: mvsas: fix command_active typo

gcc-7 notices that the condition in mvs_94xx_command_active looks
suspicious:

drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_94xx.c: In function 'mvs_94xx_command_active':
drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_94xx.c:671:15: error: '<<' in boolean context, did you mean '<' ? [-Werror=int-in-bool-context]

This was introduced when the mv_printk() statement got added, and leads
to the condition being ignored. This is probably harmless.

Changing '&&' to '&' makes the code look reasonable, as we check the
command bit before setting and printing it.
