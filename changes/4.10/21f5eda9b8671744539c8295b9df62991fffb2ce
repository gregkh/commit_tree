tools/virtio/ringtest: fix run-on-all.sh for offline cpus

Since ef1b144d ("tools/virtio/ringtest: fix run-on-all.sh to work
without /dev/cpu") run-on-all.sh uses seq 0 $HOST_AFFINITY as the list
of ids of the CPUs to run the command on (assuming ids of online CPUs
are consecutive and start from 0), where $HOST_AFFINITY is the highest
CPU id in the system previously determined using lscpu.  This can fail
on systems with offline CPUs.

Instead let's use lscpu to determine the list of online CPUs.
