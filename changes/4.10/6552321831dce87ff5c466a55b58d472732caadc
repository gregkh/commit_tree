xfs: remove i_iolock and use i_rwsem in the VFS inode instead

This patch drops the XFS-own i_iolock and uses the VFS i_rwsem which
recently replaced i_mutex instead.  This means we only have to take
one lock instead of two in many fast path operations, and we can
also shrink the xfs_inode structure.  Thanks to the xfs_ilock family
there is very little churn, the only thing of note is that we need
to switch to use the lock_two_directory helper for taking the i_rwsem
on two inodes in a few places to make sure our lock order matches
the one used in the VFS.
