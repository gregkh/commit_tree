reset: socfpga: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/reset/Kconfig:config RESET_SOCFPGA
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  bool "SoCFPGA Reset Driver" if COMPILE_TEST
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  default ARCH_SOCFPGA

or

arch/arm/mach-socfpga/Kconfig:menuconfig ARCH_SOCFPGA
arch/arm/mach-socfpga/Kconfig:  bool "Altera SOCFPGA family" if ARCH_MULTI_V7

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the small amount of modular evidence that remains, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
