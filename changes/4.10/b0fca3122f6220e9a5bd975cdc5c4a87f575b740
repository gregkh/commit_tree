qed: Correct VF mac number

When relaxing the limitation on the number of unicast MAC filters
an interface can configure, qed started passing the MAC quota to
qede. However, the value is initialized only for PFs, causing VFs
to always try and configure themselves as promiscuous
[as they believe they lack the resources to configure the rx-mode].
