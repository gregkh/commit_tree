tcp: relax listening_hash operations

softirq handlers use RCU protection to lookup listeners,
and write operations all happen from process context.
We do not need to block BH for dump operations.

Also SYN_RECV since request sockets are stored in the ehash table :

 1) inet_diag_dump_icsk() no longer need to clear
    cb->args[3] and cb->args[4] that were used as cursors while
    iterating the old per listener hash table.

 2) Also factorize a test : No need to scan listening_hash[]
    if r->id.idiag_dport is not zero.
