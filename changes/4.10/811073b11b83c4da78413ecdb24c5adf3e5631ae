i2c: Add pointer dereference protection to i2c_match_id()

Here we're providing dereference protection for i2c_match_id(), which
saves us having to do it each time it's called.  We're also stripping
out the (now) needless checks in i2c_device_match().  This patch paves
the way for other, similar code trimming.
