netfilter: xt_multiport: Fix wrong unmatch result with multiple ports

I lost one test case in the last commit for xt_multiport.
For example, the rule is "-m multiport --dports 22,80,443".
When first port is unmatched and the second is matched, the curent codes
could not return the right result.
It would return false directly when the first port is unmatched.

of multiple condition checks")
