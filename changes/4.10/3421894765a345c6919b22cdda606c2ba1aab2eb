ASoC: Intel: common: add ACPI package extraction utility

Add a new common routine to extract a package exposed by a
device indexed with the HID value. The functionality is
implemented without assumptions on the package type or
structure to allow for reuse. The caller is responsible for
defining the name and allocating structures to store the
results, ACPICA will complain in case of type mismatches
or buffer size issues.
