ASoC: rsnd: Request/Release DMA channel each time

Current Renesas Sound driver requests DMA channel when .probe timing,
and release it when .remove timing. And use DMA on .start/.stop
But, Audio DMAC power ON was handled when request timing (= .probe),
and power OFF was when release timing (= .remove).
This means Audio DMAC power is always ON during driver was enabled.
The best choice to solve this issue is that DMAEngine side handle
this. But current DMAEngine API design can't solve atmic/non-atmic
context issue for power ON/OFF. So next better choice is sound
driver request/release DMA channel each time. This patch do it
