netfilter: ipt_CLUSTERIP: check duplicate config when initializing

Now when adding an ipt_CLUSTERIP rule, it only checks duplicate config in
clusterip_config_find_get(). But after that, there may be still another
thread to insert a config with the same ip, then it leaves proc_create_data
to do duplicate check.

It's more reasonable to check duplicate config by ipt_CLUSTERIP itself,
instead of checking it by proc fs duplicate file check. Before, when proc
fs allowed duplicate name files in a directory, It could even crash kernel
because of use-after-free.

This patch is to check duplicate config under the protection of clusterip
net lock when initializing a new config and correct the return err.

Note that it also moves proc file node creation after adding new config, as
proc_create_data may sleep, it couldn't be called under the clusterip_net
lock. clusterip_config_find_get returns NULL if c->pde is null to make sure
it can't be used until the proc file node creation is done.
