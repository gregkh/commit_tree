Revert "ovl: get_write_access() in truncate"

This reverts commit 03bea60409328de54e4ff7ec41672e12a9cb0908.

Commit 4d0c5ba2ff79 ("vfs: do get_write_access() on upper layer of
overlayfs") makes the writecount checks inside overlayfs superfluous, the
file is already copied up and write access acquired on the upper inode when
ovl_setattr is called with ATTR_SIZE.
