libxfs: clean up _dir2_data_freescan

Refactor the implementations of xfs_dir2_data_freescan into a
routine that takes the raw directory block parameters and
a second function that figures out the raw parameters from the
directory inode.  This enables us to use the exact same code
for both userspace and the kernel, since repair knows exactly
which directory block geometry parameters it needs.
