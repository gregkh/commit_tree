drm/i915/debugfs: Drop i915_hws_info

i915_hws_info() has not been kept upto date (missing new engines) and so
I consider it to be unused. HWS is included in the error state, which
would be an avenue to retrieving it if required in future (possibly via
i915_engine_info). As it is currently oopsing with an rpm testcase, just
remove it.
