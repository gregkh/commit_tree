staging: lustre: mdt: fail FMODE_WRITE open if the client is read only

O_WRONLY/O_RDWR open on a file will get EROFS on a read only client,
but the rpc gets sent to the mdt anyway.
mdt will increase the mot_write_count of the mdt object, blocking
subsequent FMODE_EXEC open to the same file.

This patch makes sure we fail the FMODE_WRITE open with EROFS on the
client straight away without sending the rpc to mdt.
