ARC: mm: No need to save cache version in @cpuinfo

Historical MMU revisions have been paired with Cache revision updates
which are captured in MMU and Cache Build Configuration Registers respectively.

This was used in boot code to check for configurations mismatches,
speically in simulations (such as running with non existent caches,
non pairing MMU and Cache version etc). This can instead be inferred
from other cache params such as line size. So remove @ver from post
processed @cpuinfo which could be used later to save soem other
interesting info.
