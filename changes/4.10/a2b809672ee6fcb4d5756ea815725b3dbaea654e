block: replace REQ_NOIDLE with REQ_IDLE

Noidle should be the default for writes as seen by all the compounds
definitions in fs.h using it.  In fact only direct I/O really should
be using NODILE, so turn the whole flag around to get the defaults
right, which will make our life much easier especially onces the
WRITE_* defines go away.

This assumes all the existing "raw" users of REQ_SYNC for writes
want noidle behavior, which seems to be spot on from a quick audit.
