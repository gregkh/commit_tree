fscrypt: Add in-place encryption mode

ext4 and f2fs require a bounce page when encrypting pages. However, not
all filesystems will need that (eg. UBIFS). This is handled via a
flag on fscrypt_operations where a fs implementation can select in-place
encryption over using a bounce page (which is the default).
