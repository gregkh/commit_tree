perf tools: Introduce perf hooks

Perf hooks allow hooking user code at perf events. They can be used for
manipulation of BPF maps, taking snapshot and reporting results. In this
patch two perf hook points are introduced: record_start and record_end.

To avoid buggy user actions, a SIGSEGV signal handler is introduced into
'perf record'. It turns off perf hook if it causes a segfault and report
an error to help debugging.

A test case for perf hook is introduced.

Test result:
  $ ./buildperf/perf test -v hook
  50: Test perf hooks                                          :
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 10311
  SIGSEGV is observed as expected, try to recover.
  Fatal error (SEGFAULT) in perf hook 'test'
  test child finished with 0
  ---- end ----
  Test perf hooks: Ok
