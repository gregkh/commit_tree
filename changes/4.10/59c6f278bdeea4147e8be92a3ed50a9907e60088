x86/cpu: Get rid of the show_msr= boot option

It is useless as it dumps the MSRs too early BUT(!) we do set MSRs later too.
Also, it dumps only BSP MSRs as it gets called only for CPU 0.

And the MSR range array would need constant updating anyway, and so on
and so on...

Oh, and we have msr.ko and msr-tools which are the much better solution
anyway. So off it goes...
