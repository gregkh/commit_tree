at86rf230: Allow slow GPIO pins for "rstn"

Driver code never touches "rstn" signal in atomic context, so there's
no need to implicitly put such restriction on it by using gpio_set_value
to manipulate it. Replace gpio_set_value to gpio_set_value_cansleep to
fix that.

As a an example of where such restriction might be inconvenient,
consider a hardware design where "rstn" is connected to a pin of I2C/SPI
GPIO expander chip.
