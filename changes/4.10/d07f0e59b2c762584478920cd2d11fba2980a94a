drm/i915: Move GEM activity tracking into a common struct reservation_object

In preparation to support many distinct timelines, we need to expand the
activity tracking on the GEM object to handle more than just a request
per engine. We already use the struct reservation_object on the dma-buf
to handle many fence contexts, so integrating that into the GEM object
itself is the preferred solution. (For example, we can now share the same
reservation_object between every consumer/producer using this buffer and
skip the manual import/export via dma-buf.)

v2: Reimplement busy-ioctl (by walking the reservation object), postpone
the ABI change for another day. Similarly use the reservation object to
find the last_write request (if active and from i915) for choosing
display CS flips.

Caveats:

 * busy-ioctl: busy-ioctl only reports on the native fences, it will not
warn of stalls (in set-domain-ioctl, pread/pwrite etc) if the object is
being rendered to by external fences. It also will not report the same
busy state as wait-ioctl (or polling on the dma-buf) in the same
circumstances. On the plus side, it does retain reporting of which
*i915* engines are engaged with this object.

 * non-blocking atomic modesets take a step backwards as the wait for
render completion blocks the ioctl. This is fixed in a subsequent
patch to use a fence instead for awaiting on the rendering, see
"drm/i915: Restore nonblocking awaits for modesetting"

 * dynamic array manipulation for shared-fences in reservation is slower
than the previous lockless static assignment (e.g. gem_exec_lut_handle
runtime on ivb goes from 42s to 66s), mainly due to atomic operations
(maintaining the fence refcounts).

 * loss of object-level retirement callbacks, emulated by VMA retirement
tracking.

 * minor loss of object-level last activity information from debugfs,
could be replaced with per-vma information if desired
