clk: qcom: Add support for alpha pll hwfsm ops

Some PLLs can support an HW FSM mode (different from the Votable FSMs,
though its the same bit used to enable Votable FSMs as well as HW FSMs)
which enables the HW to do the bypass/reset/enable-output-ctrl sequence
on its own. So all thats needed from SW is to set the FSM_ENA bit.
PLL_ACTIVE_FLAG is whats used to check if the PLL is active/enabled.

Some of the PLLs which support HW FSM can also need an OFFLINE request
that needs to be toggled across the enable/disable. We use a flag to
identify such cases and handle them.
