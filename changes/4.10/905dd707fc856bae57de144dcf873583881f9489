module: When modifying a module's text ignore modules which are going away too

By default, during the access permission modification of a module's core
and init pages, we only ignore modules that are malformed. Albeit for a
module which is going away, it does not make sense to change its text to
RO since the module should be RW, before deallocation.

This patch makes set_all_modules_text_ro() skip modules which are going
away too.
