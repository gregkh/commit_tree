drm/i915: Suppress underruns during DP link retraining

DP link retraining causes (spurious?) underruns. We can't really avoid
them, except perhaps by doing a full modeset (which has its own underrun
suppression anyway). So let's just hide them.

MST still has its own logic for retrainin, but a bigger hpd handling
cleanup/unification is needed there anyway, so let's leave that be for now.
