net/sched: cls_flower: Set the filter Hardware device for all use-cases

Check if the returned device from tcf_exts_get_dev function supports tc
offload and in case the rule can't be offloaded, set the filter hw_dev
parameter to the original device given by the user.

The filter hw_device parameter should always be set by fl_hw_replace_filter
function, since this pointer is used by dump stats and destroy
filter for each flower rule (offloaded or not).
