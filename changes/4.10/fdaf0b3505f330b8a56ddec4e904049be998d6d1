edac: move documentation from edac_pci*.c to edac_pci.h

Several functions are documented at edac_pci.c and edac_pci_sysfs.c.

As we'll be including edac_pci.h at drivers-api book, move those,
in order for the kernel-doc markups be part of the API
documentation book.

As several of those kernel-doc macros are not in the right format,
fix them.
