genirq/affinity: Introduce struct irq_affinity

Some drivers (various network and RDMA adapter for example) have a MSI-X
vector layout where most of the vectors are used for I/O queues and should
have CPU affinity assigned to them, but some (usually 1 but sometimes more)
at the beginning or end are used for low-performance admin or configuration
work and should not have any explicit affinity assigned to them.

Add a new irq_affinity structure, which will be passed through a variant of
pci_irq_alloc_vectors that allows to specify these requirements (and is
extensible to any future quirks in that area) so that the core IRQ affinity
algorithm can take this quirks into account.
