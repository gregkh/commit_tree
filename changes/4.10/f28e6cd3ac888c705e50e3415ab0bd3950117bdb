staging: most: hdm-usb: remove filtering of networking state

In case the networking interface goes down and up again, the USB HDM does
not report the state the MOST networking interface controller is in. This
might lead to nonfunctional network.

Since the networking AIM already takes care of hardware address checking
and tracing it can be removed from the HDM USB, which is what this patch is
doing.
