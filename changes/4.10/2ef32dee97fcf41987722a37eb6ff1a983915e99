drm/i915/gen9: fix the WM memory bandwidth WA for Y tiling cases

The previous spec version said "double Ytile planes minimum lines",
and I interpreted this as referring to what the spec calls "Y tile
minimum", but in fact it was referring to what the spec calls "Minimum
Scanlines for Y tile". I noticed that Mahesh Kumar had a different
interpretation, so I sent and email to the spec authors and got
clarification on the correct meaning. Also, BSpec was updated and
should be clear now.
