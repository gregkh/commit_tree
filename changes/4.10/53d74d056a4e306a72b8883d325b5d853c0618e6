thread_info: factor out restart_block

Since commit f56141e3e2d9aabf ("all arches, signal: move restart_block
to struct task_struct"), thread_info and restart_block have been
logically distinct, yet struct restart_block is still defined in
<linux/thread_info.h>.

At least one architecture (erroneously) uses restart_block as part of
its thread_info, and thus the definition of restart_block must come
before the include of <asm/thread_info>. Subsequent patches in this
series need to shuffle the order of includes and definitions in
<linux/thread_info.h>, and will make this ordering fragile.

This patch moves the definition of restart_block out to its own header.
This serves as generic cleanup, logically separating thread_info and
restart_block, and also makes it easier to avoid fragility.
