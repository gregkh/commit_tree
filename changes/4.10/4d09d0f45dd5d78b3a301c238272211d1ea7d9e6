mm: add documentation for page fragment APIs

This is a first pass at trying to add documentation for the page_frag
APIs.  They may still change over time but for now I thought I would try
to get these documented so that as more network drivers and stack calls
make use of them we have one central spot to document how they are meant
to be used.
