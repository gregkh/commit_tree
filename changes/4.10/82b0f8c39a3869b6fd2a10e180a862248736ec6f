mm: join struct fault_env and vm_fault

Currently we have two different structures for passing fault information
around - struct vm_fault and struct fault_env.  DAX will need more
information in struct vm_fault to handle its faults so the content of
that structure would become event closer to fault_env.  Furthermore it
would need to generate struct fault_env to be able to call some of the
generic functions.  So at this point I don't think there's much use in
keeping these two structures separate.  Just embed into struct vm_fault
all that is needed to use it for both purposes.
