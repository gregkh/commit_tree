net: stmmac: stmmac_platform: use correct setup function for gmac4

devicetree binding for stmmac states:
- compatible: Should be "snps,dwmac-<ip_version>", "snps,dwmac"
	For backwards compatibility: "st,spear600-gmac" is also supported.

Previously, when specifying "snps,dwmac-4.10a", "snps,dwmac" as your
compatible string, plat_stmmacenet_data would have both has_gmac and
has_gmac4 set.

This would lead to stmmac_hw_init calling dwmac1000_setup rather than
dwmac4_setup, resulting in a non-functional driver.
This happened since the check for has_gmac is done before the check for
has_gmac4. However, the order should not matter, so it does not make sense
to have both set.

If something is valid for both, you should do as the stmmac_interrupt does:
if (priv->plat->has_gmac || priv->plat->has_gmac4) ...

The places where it was obvious that the author actually meant
if (has_gmac || has_gmac4) rather than if (has_gmac) has been updated.
