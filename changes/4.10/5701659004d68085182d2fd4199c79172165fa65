net: stmmac: Fix race between stmmac_drv_probe and stmmac_open

There is currently a small window during which the network device registered by
stmmac can be made visible, yet all resources, including and clock and MDIO bus
have not had a chance to be set up, this can lead to the following error to
occur:

[  473.919358] stmmaceth 0000:01:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized):

Fix this by making sure that register_netdev() is the last thing being done,
which guarantees that the clock and the MDIO bus are available.
