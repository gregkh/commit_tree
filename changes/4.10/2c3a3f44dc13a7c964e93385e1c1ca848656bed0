drm/i915: Fix pages pin counting around swizzle quirk

commit bc0629a76726 ("drm/i915: Track pages pinned due to swizzling
quirk") fixed one problem, but revealed a whole lot more. The root cause
of the pin count mismatch for the swizzle quirk (for L-shaped memory on
gen3/4) was that we were incrementing the pages_pin_count upon getting
the backing pages but then overwriting the pages_pin_count to set it to
1 afterwards. With a little bit of adjustment to satisfy the GEM_BUG_ON
sanitychecks, the fix is to replace the explicit atomic_set with an
atomic_inc.

v2: Consistently use atomics (not mix atomics and helpers) within the
lowlevel get_pages routines. This makes the atomic operations much
clearer.
