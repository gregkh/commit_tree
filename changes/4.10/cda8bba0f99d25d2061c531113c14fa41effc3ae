vhost: fix initialization for vq->is_le

Currently, under certain circumstances vhost_init_is_le does just a part
of the initialization job, and depends on vhost_reset_is_le being called
too. For this reason vhost_vq_init_access used to call vhost_reset_is_le
when vq->private_data is NULL. This is not only counter intuitive, but
also real a problem because it breaks vhost_net. The bug was introduced to
vhost_net with commit 2751c9882b94 ("vhost: cross-endian support for
legacy devices"). The symptom is corruption of the vq's used.idx field
(virtio) after VHOST_NET_SET_BACKEND was issued as a part of the vhost
shutdown on a vq with pending descriptors.

Let us make sure the outcome of vhost_init_is_le never depend on the state
it is actually supposed to initialize, and fix virtio_net by removing the
reset from vhost_vq_init_access.

With the above, there is no reason for vhost_reset_is_le to do just half
of the job. Let us make vhost_reset_is_le reinitialize is_le.
