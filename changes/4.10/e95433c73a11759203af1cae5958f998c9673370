drm/i915: Rearrange i915_wait_request() accounting with callers

Our low-level wait routine has evolved from our generic wait interface
that handled unlocked, RPS boosting, waits with time tracking. If we
push our GEM fence tracking to use reservation_objects (required for
handling multiple timelines), we lose the ability to pass the required
information down to i915_wait_request(). However, if we push the extra
functionality from i915_wait_request() to the individual callsites
(i915_gem_object_wait_rendering and i915_gem_wait_ioctl) that make use
of those extras, we can both simplify our low level wait and prepare for
extending the GEM interface for use of reservation_objects.
