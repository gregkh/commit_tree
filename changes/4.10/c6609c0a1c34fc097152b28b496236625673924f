vfs: add path_is_mountpoint() helper

d_mountpoint() can only be used reliably to establish if a dentry is
not mounted in any namespace. It isn't aware of the possibility there
may be multiple mounts using a given dentry that may be in a different
namespace.

Add helper functions, path_is_mountpoint(), that checks if a struct path
is a mountpoint for this case.
