jump label: pass kbuild_cflags when checking for asm goto support

Some versions of ARM GCC compiler such as Android toolchain throws in a
'-fpic' flag by default.  This causes the gcc-goto check script to fail
although some config would have '-fno-pic' flag in the KBUILD_CFLAGS.

This patch passes the KBUILD_CFLAGS to the check script so that the
script does not rely on the default config from different compilers.
