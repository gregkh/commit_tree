pstore: Make spinlock per zone instead of global

Currently pstore has a global spinlock for all zones. Since the zones
are independent and modify different areas of memory, there's no need
to have a global lock, so we should use a per-zone lock as introduced
here. Also, when ramoops's ftrace use-case has a FTRACE_PER_CPU flag
introduced later, which splits the ftrace memory area into a single zone
per CPU, it will eliminate the need for locking. In preparation for this,
make the locking optional.
