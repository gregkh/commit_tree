drm/probe-helpers: Drop locking from poll_enable

It was only needed to protect the connector_list walking, see

    drm/probe-helper: Grab mode_config.mutex in poll_init/enable

Unfortunately the commit message of that patch fails to mention that
the new locking check was for the connector_list.

But that requirement disappeared in

    drm: Convert all helpers to drm_connector_list_iter

and so we can drop this again.

This fixes a locking inversion on nouveau, where the rpm code needs to
re-enable. But in other places the rpm_get() calls are nested within
the big modeset locks.

While at it, also improve the kerneldoc for these two functions a
notch.

v2: Update the kerneldoc even more to explain that these functions
can't be called concurrently, or bad things happen (Chris).
