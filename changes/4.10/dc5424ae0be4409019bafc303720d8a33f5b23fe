staging: vc04_services: call sg_init_table to init scatterlist

Call the sg_init_table function to correctly initialze
the DMA scatterlist.  This function is required to completely
initialize the list and is mandatory if DMA debugging is
enabled in the build configuration.

One of the purposes of sg_init_table is to set
the magic "cookie" on each list element and ensure
the chain end is marked.
