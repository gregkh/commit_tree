clk: qcom: gdsc: Add support for gdscs with HW control

Some GDSCs might support a HW control mode, where in the power
domain (gdsc) is brought in and out of low power state (while
unsued) without any SW assistance, saving power.
Such GDSCs can be configured in a HW control mode when powered on
until they are explicitly requested to be powered off by software.
