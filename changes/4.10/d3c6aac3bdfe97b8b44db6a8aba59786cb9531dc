mmc: delete is_first_req parameter from pre-request callback

The void (*pre_req) callback in the struct mmc_host_ops vtable
is passing an argument "is_first_req" indicating whether this is
the first request or not.

None of the in-kernel users use this parameter: instead, since
they all just do variants of dma_map* they use the DMA cookie
to indicate whether a pre* callback has already been done for
a request when they decide how to handle it.

Delete the parameter from the callback and all users, as it is
just pointless cruft.
