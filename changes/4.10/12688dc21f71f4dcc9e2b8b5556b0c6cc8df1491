Revert "i2c: designware: detect when dynamic tar update is possible"

This reverts commit 63d0f0a6952a1a02bc4f116b7da7c7887e46efa3.

It caused a regression on platforms where I2C controller is synthesized
with dynamic TAR update disabled. Detection code is testing is bit
DW_IC_CON_10BITADDR_MASTER in register DW_IC_CON read-only but fails to
restore original value in case bit is read-write.

Instead of fixing this we revert the commit since it was preparation for
the commit 0317e6c0f1dc ("i2c: designware: do not disable adapter after
transfer") which was also reverted.
