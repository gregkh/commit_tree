net: add an ioctl to get a socket network namespace

Each socket operates in a network namespace where it has been created,
so if we want to dump and restore a socket, we have to know its network
namespace.

We have a socket_diag to get information about sockets, it doesn't
report sockets which are not bound or connected.

This patch introduces a new socket ioctl, which is called SIOCGSKNS
and used to get a file descriptor for a socket network namespace.

A task must have CAP_NET_ADMIN in a target network namespace to
use this ioctl.
