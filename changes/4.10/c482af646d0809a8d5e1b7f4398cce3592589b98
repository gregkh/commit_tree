IB/mlx4: Fix out-of-range array index in destroy qp flow

For non-special QPs, the port value becomes non-zero only at the
RESET-to-INIT transition. If the QP has not undergone that transition,
its port number value is still zero.

If such a QP is destroyed before being moved out of the RESET state,
subtracting one from the qp port number results in a negative value.
Using that negative value as an index into the qp1_proxy array
results in an out-of-bounds array reference.

Fix this by testing that the QP type is one that uses qp1_proxy before
using the port number. For special QPs of all types, the port number is
specified at QP creation time.
