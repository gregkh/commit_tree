net: phy: Fix use after free in phy_detach()

If device_release_driver(&phydev->mdio.dev) is called, it releases all
resources belonging to the PHY device. Hence the subsequent call to
phy_led_triggers_unregister() will access already freed memory when
unregistering the LEDs.

Move the call to phy_led_triggers_unregister() before the possible call
to device_release_driver() to fix this.
