af_packet: Use virtio_net_hdr_to_skb().

Use the common virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() instead of open coding it.
Other call sites were changed by commit fd2a0437dc, but this one was
missed, maybe because it is split in two parts of the source code.

Interim comparisons of 'vnet_hdr->gso_type' still work as both the
vnet_hdr and skb notion of gso_type is zero when there is no gso.
