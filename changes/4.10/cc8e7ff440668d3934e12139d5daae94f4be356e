[media] af9005: remove a printk that would require a KERN_CONT

The dvb-usb system has its own macro to print hexa dumps
(debug_dump). Such macro doesn't support messages with
KERN_CONT after commit 563873318d32 ("Merge branch 'printk-cleanups'").
So, let's get rid of a printk() that would be assuming that
this would work.
