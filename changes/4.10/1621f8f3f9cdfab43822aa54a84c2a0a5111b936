btrfs: use bio_for_each_segment_all in __btrfsic_submit_bio

And remove the bogus check for a NULL return value from kmap, which
can't happen.  While we're at it: I don't think that kmapping up to 256
will work without deadlocks on highmem machines, a better idea would
be to use vm_map_ram to map all of them into a single virtual address
range.  Incidentally that would also simplify the code a lot.
