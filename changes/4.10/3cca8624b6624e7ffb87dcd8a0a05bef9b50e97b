USB: serial: ch341: fix line settings after reset-resume

A recent change added support for modifying the default line-control
settings, but did not make sure that the modified settings were used as
part of reconfiguration after a device has been reset during resume.

This caused a port that was open before suspend to be unusable until
being closed and reopened.

length, stop bits")
