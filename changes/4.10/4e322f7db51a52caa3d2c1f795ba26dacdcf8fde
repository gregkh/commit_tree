ath10k: fix TLV set regdomain command

There is a typo bug in the current implementation of
ath10k_wmi_tlv_op_gen_pdev_set_rd.
The conformance test limits are not set up properly.

The two arguments ctl2g and ctl5g were not used at all.
Instead, the regdomain arguments rd2g and rd5g were used
for the ctl settings as well.
