NTB: ntb_transport: fix debugfs_remove_recursive

The call to debugfs_remove_recursive(qp->debugfs_dir) of the sub-level
directory must not be later than
debugfs_remove_recursive(nt_debugfs_dir) of the top-level directory.
Otherwise, the sub-level directory will not exist, and it would be
invalid (panic) to attempt to remove it.  This removes the top-level
directory last, after sub-level directories have been cleaned up.
