Input: gpio_keys_polled - keep button data constant

Commit 633a21d80b4a ("input: gpio_keys_polled: Add support for GPIO
descriptors") placed gpio descriptor into gpio_keys_button structure, which
is supposed to be part of platform data and not modifiable by the driver.
To keep the data constant, let's move the descriptor to
gpio_keys_button_data structure instead.
