drm/nouveau/gr: fallback to legacy paths during firmware lookup

Look for firmware files using the legacy ("nouveau/nvxx_fucxxxx") path
if they cannot be found in the new, "official" path. User setups were
broken by the switch, which is bad.

There are only 4 firmware files we may want to look up that way, so
hardcode them into the lookup function. All new firmware files should
use the standard "nvidia/<chip>/gr/" path.
