udp: use it's own memory accounting schema

Completely avoid default sock memory accounting and replace it
with udp-specific accounting.

Since the new memory accounting model encapsulates completely
the required locking, remove the socket lock on both enqueue and
dequeue, and avoid using the backlog on enqueue.

Be sure to clean-up rx queue memory on socket destruction, using
udp its own sk_destruct.

Tested using pktgen with random src port, 64 bytes packet,
wire-speed on a 10G link as sender and udp_sink as the receiver,
using an l4 tuple rxhash to stress the contention, and one or more
udp_sink instances with reuseport.

v4 -> v5:
  - avoid unneeded test in first_packet_length

v3 -> v4:
  - remove useless sk_rcvqueues_full() call

v2 -> v3:
  - do not set the now unsed backlog_rcv callback

v1 -> v2:
  - add memory pressure support
  - fixed dropwatch accounting for ipv6
