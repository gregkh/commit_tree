drm: Add reference counting to drm_atomic_state

drm_atomic_state has a complicated single owner model that tracks the
single reference from allocation through to destruction on another
thread - or perhaps on a local error path. We can simplify this tracking
by using reference counting (at a cost of a few more atomics). This is
even more beneficial when the lifetime of the state becomes more
convoluted than being passed to a single worker thread for the commit.

v2: Double check !intel atomic_commit functions for missing gets
v3: Update kerneldocs
