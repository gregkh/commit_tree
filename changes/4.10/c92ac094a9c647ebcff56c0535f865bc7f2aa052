drm/i915: Remove superfluous wait_for_error() from throttle-ioctl

The throttle-ioctl never touches the struct_mutex. It does, however, as
part of its ABI report whether the hardware is terminally wedged. For
that purposes, it only has to report the current state and not incur the
cost of checking/waiting every invocation, as we do not have to wait for
a reset before waiting on a request to ensure completion (that is baked
into the wait request implementation).
