ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add support for A31 Line Out playback

The A31 integrated codec has a second "Line Out" output which does not
include an integrated amplifier in its path. This path does have a
separate volume control.

This patch adds support for the playback path from the DAC to the Line
Out pins.
