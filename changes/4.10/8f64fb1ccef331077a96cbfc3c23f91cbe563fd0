namei: fold should_follow_link() with the step into not-followed link

All callers are followed by the same boilerplate - "if it has returned
0, update nd->path/inode/seq - we are not following a symlink here".
Pull it into the function itself, renaming it into step_into().
Rename WALK_GET to WALK_FOLLOW, while we are at it - more descriptive
name.
