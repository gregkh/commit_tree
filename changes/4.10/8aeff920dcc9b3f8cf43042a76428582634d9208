netfilter: nf_tables: add stateful object reference to set elements

This patch allows you to refer to stateful objects from set elements.
This provides the infrastructure to create maps where the right hand
side of the mapping is a stateful object.

This allows us to build dictionaries of stateful objects, that you can
use to perform fast lookups using any arbitrary key combination.
