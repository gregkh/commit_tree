usb: host: xhci: handle COMP_STOP from SETUP phase too

Stop Endpoint command can come at any point and we
have no control of that. We should make sure to
handle COMP_STOP on SETUP phase as well, otherwise
urb->actual_length might be set to negative values
in some occasions such as below:

 urb->length = 4;
 build_control_transfer_td_for(urb, ep);

 					stop_endpoint(ep);

COMP_STOP:
	[...]
	urb->actual_length = urb->length - trb->length;

trb->length is 8 for SETUP stage (8 control request
bytes), so actual_length would be set to -4 in this
case.

While doing that, also make sure to use TRB_TYPE
field of the actual TRB instead of matching pointers
to figure out in which stage of the control transfer
we got our completion event.
