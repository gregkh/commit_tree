tty: nozomi: avoid sprintf buffer overflow

Testing with a gcc-7 snapshot produced an internal compiler error
for this file:

drivers/tty/nozomi.c: In function 'receive_flow_control':
drivers/tty/nozomi.c:919:12: internal compiler error: in get_substring_ranges_for_loc, at input.c:1388
 static int receive_flow_control(struct nozomi *dc)

I've reported this at https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=78569
but also noticed that the code line contains a stack overflow, as it prints
a string into a slightly shorter fixed-length 'tmp' variable.

A lot of the code here is unnecessary and can be expressed in a simpler
way, relying on the fact that removing the 'DEBUG' macro will also get
rid of all pr_debug() calls. This change should not change any of the
output but avoids both the stack overflow and the gcc crash.

The stack overflow will not happen unless a module load parameter is
also set to enable the debug messages.
