vgaarb: use valid dev pointer in vgaarb_info()

We now pass the device to the debug messages, but on non-x86,
this is an invalid pointer in vga_arb_device_init:

drivers/gpu/vga/vgaarb.c: In function 'vga_arb_device_init':
drivers/gpu/vga/vgaarb.c:1467:4: error: 'dev' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This moves the initialization of the dev pointer outside of the
architecture #ifdef.
