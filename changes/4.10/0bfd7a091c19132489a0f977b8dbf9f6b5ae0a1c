f2fs: Use generic zoned block device terminology

SMR stands for "Shingled Magnetic Recording" which makes sense
only for hard disk drives (spinning rust). The ZBC/ZAC standards
enable management of SMR disks, but solid state drives may also
support those standards. So rename the HMSMR feature to BLKZONED
to avoid a HDD centric terminology. For the same reason, rename
f2fs_sb_mounted_hmsmr to f2fs_sb_mounted_blkzoned.
