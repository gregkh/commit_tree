svcauth_gss: Close connection when dropping an incoming message

S5.3.3.1 of RFC 2203 requires that an incoming GSS-wrapped message
whose sequence number lies outside the current window is dropped.
The rationale is:

  The reason for discarding requests silently is that the server
  is unable to determine if the duplicate or out of range request
  was due to a sequencing problem in the client, network, or the
  operating system, or due to some quirk in routing, or a replay
  attack by an intruder.  Discarding the request allows the client
  to recover after timing out, if indeed the duplication was
  unintentional or well intended.

However, clients may rely on the server dropping the connection to
indicate that a retransmit is needed. Without a connection reset, a
client can wait forever without retransmitting, and the workload
just stops dead. I've reproduced this behavior by running xfstests
generic/323 on an NFSv4.0 mount with proto=rdma and sec=krb5i.

To address this issue, have the server close the connection when it
silently discards an incoming message due to a GSS sequence number
problem.

There are a few other places where the server will never reply.
Change those spots in a similar fashion.
