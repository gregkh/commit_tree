xfs: pass state not whichfork to trace_xfs_extlist

When xfs_bmap_trace_exlist called trace_xfs_extlist,
it sent in the "whichfork" var instead of the bmap "state"
as expected (even though state was already set up for this
purpose).

As a result, the xfs_bmap_class in tracing code used
"whichfork" not state in xfs_iext_state_to_fork(), and got
the wrong ifork pointer.  It all goes downhill from
there, including an ASSERT when ifp_bytes is empty
by the time it reaches xfs_iext_get_ext():

XFS: Assertion failed: idx < ifp->if_bytes / sizeof(xfs_bmbt_rec_t)
