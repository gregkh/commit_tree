ACPI / osl: Remove acpi_get_table_with_size()/early_acpi_os_unmap_memory() users

This patch removes the users of the deprectated APIs:
 acpi_get_table_with_size()
 early_acpi_os_unmap_memory()
The following APIs should be used instead of:
 acpi_get_table()
 acpi_put_table()

The deprecated APIs are invented to be a replacement of acpi_get_table()
during the early stage so that the early mapped pointer will not be stored
in ACPICA core and thus the late stage acpi_get_table() won't return a
wrong pointer. The mapping size is returned just because it is required by
early_acpi_os_unmap_memory() to unmap the pointer during early stage.

But as the mapping size equals to the acpi_table_header.length
(see acpi_tb_init_table_descriptor() and acpi_tb_validate_table()), when
such a convenient result is returned, driver code will start to use it
instead of accessing acpi_table_header to obtain the length.

Thus this patch cleans up the drivers by replacing returned table size with
acpi_table_header.length, and should be a no-op.
