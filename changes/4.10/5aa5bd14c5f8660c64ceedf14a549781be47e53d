bpf: add initial suite for selftests

Add a start of a test suite for kernel selftests. This moves test_verifier
and test_maps over to tools/testing/selftests/bpf/ along with various
code improvements and also adds a script for invoking test_bpf module.
The test suite can simply be run via selftest framework, f.e.:

  # cd tools/testing/selftests/bpf/
  # make
  # make run_tests

Both test_verifier and test_maps were kind of misplaced in samples/bpf/
directory and we were looking into adding them to selftests for a while
now, so it can be picked up by kbuild bot et al and hopefully also get
more exposure and thus new test case additions.
