rtc: add support for EPSON TOYOCOM RTC-7301SF/DG

This adds support for EPSON TOYOCOM RTC-7301SF/DG which has parallel
interface compatible with SRAM.

This driver supports basic clock, calendar and alarm functionality.

Tested with Microblaze linux running on Artix7 FPGA board with my own
custom IP for RTC-7301.
