PM / OPP: Allow platform specific custom set_opp() callbacks

The generic set_opp() handler isn't sufficient for platforms with
complex DVFS.  For example, some TI platforms have multiple regulators
for a CPU device. The order in which various supplies need to be
programmed is only known to the platform code and its best to leave it
to it.

This patch implements APIs to register platform specific set_opp()
callback.
