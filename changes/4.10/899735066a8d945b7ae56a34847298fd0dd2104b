perf tools: Use normal error reporting when processing PERF_RECORD_READ events

We already have handling for errors when processing PERF_RECORD_ events,
so instead of calling die() when not being able to alloc, propagate the
error, so that the normal UI exit sequence can take place, the user be
warned and possibly the terminal be properly reset to a sane mode.
