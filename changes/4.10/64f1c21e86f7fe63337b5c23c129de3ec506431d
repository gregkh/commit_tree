blk-mq: make the polling code adaptive

The previous commit introduced the hybrid sleep/poll mode. Take
that one step further, and use the completion latencies to
automatically sleep for half the mean completion time. This is
a good approximation.

This changes the 'io_poll_delay' sysfs file a bit to expose the
various options. Depending on the value, the polling code will
behave differently:

-1	Never enter hybrid sleep mode
 0	Use half of the completion mean for the sleep delay
>0	Use this specific value as the sleep delay
