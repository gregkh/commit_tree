ARM: imx: Added perf functionality to mmdc driver

MMDC is a multi-mode DDR controller that supports DDR3/DDR3L x16/x32/x64
and LPDDR2 two channel x16/x32 memory types. MMDC is configurable, high
performance, and optimized. MMDC is present on i.MX6 Quad and i.MX6
QuadPlus devices, but this driver only supports i.MX6 Quad at the moment.
MMDC provides registers for performance counters which read via this
driver to help debug memory throughput and similar issues.

$ perf stat -a -e mmdc/busy-cycles/,mmdc/read-accesses/,mmdc/read-bytes/,mmdc/total-cycles/,mmdc/write-accesses/,mmdc/write-bytes/ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M count=5000
