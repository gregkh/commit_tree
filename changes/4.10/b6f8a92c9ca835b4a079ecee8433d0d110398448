posix-timers: give lazy compilers some help optimizing code away

The OpenRISC compiler (so far) fails to optimize away a large portion of
code containing a reference to posix_timer_event in alarmtimer.c when
CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS is unset.  Let's give it a direct clue to let the
build succeed.

This fixes
[linux-next:master 6682/7183] alarmtimer.c:undefined reference to `posix_timer_event'
reported by kbuild test robot.
