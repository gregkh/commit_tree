perf probe: Fix --funcs to show correct symbols for offline module

Fix --funcs (-F) option to show correct symbols for offline module.
Since previous perf-probe uses machine__findnew_module_map() for offline
module, even if user passes a module file (with full path) which is for
other architecture, perf-probe always tries to load symbol map for
current kernel module.

This fix uses dso__new_map() to load the map from given binary as same
as a map for user applications.
