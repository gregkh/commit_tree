i40e: simplify txd use count calculation

The i40e_txd_use_count function was fast but confusing. In the comments,
it even admits that it's ugly. So replace it with a new function that is
(very) slightly faster and has extensive commenting to help the thicker
among us (including the author, who will forget in a week) understand
how it works.
