Revert "drm/amdgpu: Only update the CUR_SIZE register when necessary"

This reverts commits 7c83d7abc9997cf1efac2c0ce384b5e8453ee870 and
a1f49cc179ce6b7b7758ae3ff5cdb138d0ee0f56.

They caused the HW cursor to disappear under various circumstances in
the wild. I wasn't able to reproduce any of them, and I'm not sure
what's going on. But those changes aren't a big deal anyway, so let's
just revert for now.
