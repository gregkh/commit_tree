staging/lustre/llite: update ras window correctly

When stride-RA hit case miss, we only reset normal sequential
read-ahead window, but not reset the stride IO to avoid the overhead
of re-detecting stride IO. While when the normal RA window is set
to not insect with the stride-RA window, when we try to increase
the stride-RA window length later, the presumption does not hold.

This patch resets the stride IO as well in this case.
