ALSA: usb-audio: Eliminate noise at the start of DSD playback.

[Problem]
In some USB DACs, a terrible pop noise comes to be heard
at the start of DSD playback (in the following situations).

- play first DSD track
- change from PCM track to DSD track
- change from DSD64 track to DSD128 track (and etc...)
- seek DSD track
- Fast-Forward/Rewind DSD track

[Cause]
At the start of playback, there is a little silence.
The silence bit pattern "0x69" is required on DSD mode,
but it is not like that.

[Solution]
This patch adds DSD silence pattern to the endpoint settings.
