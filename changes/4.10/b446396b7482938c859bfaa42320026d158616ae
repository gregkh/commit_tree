dm space map: always set ev if sm_ll_mutate() succeeds

If no block was allocated or freed, sm_ll_mutate() wasn't setting
*ev, leaving the variable unitialized. sm_ll_insert(),
sm_disk_inc_block(), and sm_disk_new_block() all check ev to see
if there was an allocation event in sm_ll_mutate(), possibly
reading unitialized data.

If no allocation event occured, sm_ll_mutate() should set *ev
to SM_NONE.
