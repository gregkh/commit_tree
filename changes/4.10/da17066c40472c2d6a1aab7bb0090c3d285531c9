btrfs: pull node/sector/stripe sizes out of root and into fs_info

We track the node sizes per-root, but they never vary from the values
in the superblock.  This patch messes with the 80-column style a bit,
but subsequent patches to factor out root->fs_info into a convenience
variable fix it up again.
