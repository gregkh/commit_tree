ASoC: Intel: detect audio routing with CHAN package

Baytrail-CR devices usually expose information in the DSDT
which can be used to auto-detect AIF1/AIF2 connections.
The CHAN package contains two integers, the first one describes
the AIF number (1: AIF1, 2: AIF2) and the second the MCLK
value (ignored in this patch)

For example the following information is found in Lenovo 100s:

Device (RTEK) {
[...]
    Name (CHAN, Package (0x02)
    {
        One,
        0x017D7840
    })

While on Asus T100TAF the package values are:

    Name (CHAN, Package (0x02)
    {
        0x02,
        0x017D7840
    })

This patch relies on the new common routine to extract
a package exposed by a device indexed with the HID value.
The CHAN package contents are queried from the machine driver
and stored in a structure.

If this auto-detection fails (missing or bad package in the
BIOS), the routing falls back to SSP0-AIF2.

Note that quirks may still be needed to support mono speakers
or microphone, but this should reduce the number of issues with
Baytrail significantly.
