rcu: Tighten up __call_rcu() rcu_head alignment check

Commit 720abae3d68ae ("rcu: force alignment on struct
callback_head/rcu_head") forced the rcu_head (AKA callback_head)
structure's alignment to pointer size, that is, to 4-byte boundaries on
32-bit systems and to 8-byte boundaries on 64-bit systems.  This
commit therefore checks for this same alignment in __call_rcu(),
which used to contain a looser check for two-byte alignment.
