arm64/ptrace: Avoid uninitialised struct padding in fpr_set()

This patch adds an explicit __reserved[] field to user_fpsimd_state
to replace what was previously unnamed padding.

This ensures that data in this region are propagated across
assignment rather than being left possibly uninitialised at the
destination.
