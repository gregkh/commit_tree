skbedit: allow the user to specify bitmask for mark

The user may want to use only some bits of the skb mark in
his skbedit rules because the remaining part might be used by
something else.

Introduce the "mask" parameter to the skbedit actor in order
to implement such functionality.

When the mask is specified, only those bits selected by the
latter are altered really changed by the actor, while the
rest is left untouched.
