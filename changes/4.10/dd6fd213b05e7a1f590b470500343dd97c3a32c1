svcrdma: Remove DMA map accounting

Clean up: sc_dma_used is not required for correct operation. It is
simply a debugging tool to report when svcrdma has leaked DMA maps.

However, manipulating an atomic has a measurable CPU cost, and DMA
map accounting specific to svcrdma will be meaningless once svcrdma
is converted to use the new generic r/w API.

A similar kind of debug accounting can be done simply by enabling
the IOMMU or by using CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG, CONFIG_IOMMU_DEBUG, and
CONFIG_IOMMU_LEAK.
