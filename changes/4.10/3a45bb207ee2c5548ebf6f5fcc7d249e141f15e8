btrfs: remove root parameter from transaction commit/end routines

Now we only use the root parameter to print the root objectid in
a tracepoint.  We can use the root parameter from the transaction
handle for that.  It's also used to join the transaction with
async commits, so we remove the comment that it's just for checking.
