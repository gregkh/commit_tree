platform/x86: asus-wmi: Set specified XUSB2PR value for X550LB

The bluetooth adapter Atheros AR3012 can't be enumerated
and make the bluetooth function broken.

The error is:

 usb 2-6: device not accepting address 7, error -62
 usb usb2-port6: unable to enumerate USB device

It is caused by adapter's connected port is mapped to xHC
controller, but the xHCI is not supported by the usb device.

By referencing Intel Platform Controller Hub(PCH) datasheet,
the xHC USB 2.0 Port Routing(XUSB2PR) at offset 0xD0-0xD3h
decides the setting of mapping the port to EHCI controller or
xHC controller. And the port mapped to xHC will enable xHCI
during bus resume.

The setting of disabling bluetooth adapter's connected port is
0x000001D9. The value can be obtained by few times 1 bit flip
operation. The suited configuration should have the 'lsusb -t'
result with bluetooth using ehci:

/:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/4p, 5000M
/:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/9p, 480M
    |__ Port 5: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Video, Driver=uvcvideo, 480M
    |__ Port 5: Dev 2, If 1, Class=Video, Driver=uvcvideo, 480M
/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ehci-pci/2p, 480M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/8p, 480M
