qed*: Management firmware - notifications and defaults

Management firmware is interested in various tidbits about
the driver - including the driver state & several configuration
related fields [MTU, primtary MAC, etc.].
This adds the necessray logic to update MFW with such configurations,
some of which are passed directly via qed while for others APIs
are provide so that qede would be able to later configure if needed.

This also introduces a new default configuration for MTU which would
replace the default inherited by being an ethernet device.
