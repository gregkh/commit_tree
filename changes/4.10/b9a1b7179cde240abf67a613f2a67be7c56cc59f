i915: don't call drm_atomic_state_put on invalid pointer

The introduction of reference counting on the state structures caused
sanitize_watermarks() in i915 to break in the error handling case,
as pointed out by gcc -Wmaybe-uninitialized

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_display.c: In function ‘intel_modeset_init’:
include/drm/drm_atomic.h:224:2: error: ‘state’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This changes the function back to only drop the reference count
when it was successfully allocated first.

Fixes: 0853695c3ba4 ("drm: Add reference counting to drm_atomic_state")
