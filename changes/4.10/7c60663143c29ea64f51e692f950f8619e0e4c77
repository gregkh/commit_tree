scsi: ncr5380: Expedite register polling

Avoid the call to NCR5380_poll_politely2() when possible. The call is
easily short-circuited on the PIO fast path, using the inline wrapper.
This requires that the NCR5380_read macro be made available before
any #include "NCR5380.h" so a few declarations have to be moved too.
