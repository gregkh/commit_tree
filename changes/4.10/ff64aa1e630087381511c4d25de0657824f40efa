drm/i915: workaround sparse warning on variable length arrays

Fix sparse warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_device_info.c:195:31: warning: Variable
length array is used.

In truth the array does have constant length, but sparse is too dumb to
realize. This is a bit ugly, but silence the warning no matter what.
