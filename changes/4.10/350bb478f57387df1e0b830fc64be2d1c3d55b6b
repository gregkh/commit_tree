scsi: cxlflash: Allocate memory instead of using command pool for AFU sync

As staging for the removal of the AFU command pool, remove the reliance
upon the pool for the internal AFU sync command. Instead of obtaining an
AFU command from the pool, dynamically allocate memory with the appropriate
alignment requirements. Since the AFU sync service is only executed from
the process environment, blocking is acceptable.
