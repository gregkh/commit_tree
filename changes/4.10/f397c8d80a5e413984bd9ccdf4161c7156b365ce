mmc: block: Move files to core

Once upon a time it made sense to keep the mmc block device driver and its
related code, in its own directory called card. Over time, more an more
functions/structures have become shared through generic mmc header files,
between the core and the card directory. In other words, the relationship
between them has become closer.

By sharing functions/structures via generic header files, it becomes easy
for outside users to abuse them. In a way to avoid that from happen, let's
move the files from card directory into the core directory, as it enables
us to move definitions of functions/structures into mmc core specific
header files.

Note, this is only the first step in providing a cleaner mmc interface for
outside users. Following changes will do the actual cleanup, as that is not
part of this change.
