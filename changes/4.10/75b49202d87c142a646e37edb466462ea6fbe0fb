perf annotate: Remove duplicate 'name' field from disasm_line

The disasm_line::name field is always equal to ins::name, being used
just to locate the instruction's ins_ops from the per-arch instructions
table.

Eliminate this duplication, nuking that field and instead make
ins__find() return an ins_ops, store it in disasm_line::ins.ops, and
keep just in disasm_line::ins.name what was in disasm_line::name, this
way we end up not keeping a reference to entries in the per-arch
instructions table.

This in turn will help supporting multiple ways to manage the per-arch
instructions table, allowing resorting that array, for instance, when
the entries will move after references to its addresses were made. The
same problem is avoided when one grows the array with realloc.

So architectures simply keeping a constant array will work as well as
architectures building the table using regular expressions or other
logic that involves resorting the table.
