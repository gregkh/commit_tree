IB/mlx4: When no DMFS for IPoIB, don't allow NET_IF QPs

According to the firmware spec, FLOW_STEERING_IB_UC_QP_RANGE command is
supported only if dmfs_ipoib bit is set.

If it isn't set we want to ensure allocating NET_IF QPs fail. We do so
by filling out the allocation bitmap. By thus, the NET_IF QPs allocating
function won't find any free QP and will fail.
