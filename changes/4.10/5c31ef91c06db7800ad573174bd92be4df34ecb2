8250: FIX Fourth port offset of Pericom PI7C9X7954 boards

Hi,
below patch to fix Fourth port offset of Percom PI7C9X7954 boards.

I had a problem using Fourth port on a pci express serial board based on Pericom
PI7C9X7954. Reading datasheet I notice a "special" offset assign to this port
when used in I/O mode.

Offset 0x0 ->  UART 0
Offset 0x8 ->  UART 1
Offset 0x10 ->  UART 2
Offset 0x38 ->  UART 3  <<---- This don't follow a logical sequence

This patch add a different init to last port, to have right offset.

I check also Pericom 7952 and 7958 but that devices follow logical sequence,
so they are ok.

Regards,
Angelo
