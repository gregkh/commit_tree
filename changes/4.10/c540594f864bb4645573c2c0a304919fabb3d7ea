bpf, mlx4: fix prog refcount in mlx4_en_try_alloc_resources error path

Commit 67f8b1dcb9ee ("net/mlx4_en: Refactor the XDP forwarding rings
scheme") added a bug in that the prog's reference count is not dropped
in the error path when mlx4_en_try_alloc_resources() is failing from
mlx4_xdp_set().

We previously took bpf_prog_add(prog, priv->rx_ring_num - 1), that we
need to release again. Earlier in the call path, dev_change_xdp_fd()
itself holds a reference to the prog as well (hence the '- 1' in the
bpf_prog_add()), so a simple atomic_sub() is safe to use here. When
an error is propagated, then bpf_prog_put() is called eventually from
dev_change_xdp_fd()
