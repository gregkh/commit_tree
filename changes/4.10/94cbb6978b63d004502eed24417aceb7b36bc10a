serial: 8250_uniphier: hardcode regshift to avoid unneeded memory read

For this driver, uart_port::regshift is always 2.  Hardcode the
shift value instead of reading ->regshift to get an already known
value.  (pointed out by Denys Vlasenko)

Furthermore, I am using register macros that are already shifted,
which will save code a bit.
