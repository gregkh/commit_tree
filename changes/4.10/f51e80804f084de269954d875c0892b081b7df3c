[media] cec: pass parent device in register(), not allocate()

The cec_allocate_adapter function doesn't need the parent device, only the
cec_register_adapter function needs it.

Drop the cec_devnode parent field, since devnode.dev.parent can be used
instead.

This change makes the framework consistent with other frameworks where the
parent device is not used until the device is registered.
