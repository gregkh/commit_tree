mac80211: validate new interface's beacon intervals

As part of interface combination checking, verify any new
interface's beacon intervals. In fact, just always add the
beacon interval since that's harmless.

With this patch, mac80211 is prepared for drivers that set
the min_beacon_int_gcd parameter in interface combinations.
