cw1200: fix bogus maybe-uninitialized warning

On x86, the cw1200 driver produces a rather silly warning about the
possible use of the 'ret' variable without an initialization
presumably after being confused by the architecture specific definition
of WARN_ON:

drivers/net/wireless/st/cw1200/wsm.c: In function ‘wsm_handle_rx’:
drivers/net/wireless/st/cw1200/wsm.c:1457:9: error: ‘ret’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

We have already checked that 'count' is larger than 0 here, so
we know that 'ret' is initialized. Changing the 'for' loop
into do/while also makes this clear to the compiler.
