virtio-net: correctly handle XDP_PASS for linearized packets

When XDP_PASS were determined for linearized packets, we try to get
new buffers in the virtqueue and build skbs from them. This is wrong,
we should create skbs based on existed buffers instead. Fixing them by
creating skb based on xdp_page.

With this patch "ping 192.168.100.4 -s 3900 -M do" works for XDP_PASS.
