platform/x86: surface3-wmi: Shut up unused-function warning

The newly added driver guards its "resume" callback with an
warning in some configurations:

drivers/platform/x86/surface3-wmi.c:248:12: error: 's3_wmi_resume' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Using a __maybe_unused annotation without an #ifdef avoids the mistake more
reliably.
