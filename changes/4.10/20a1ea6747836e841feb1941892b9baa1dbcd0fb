net/mlx5e: Support VF vport link state control for SRIOV switchdev mode

Reflect the administative link changes done on the VF representor to the
VF e-switch vport. This means that doing ip link set down/up commands on
the VF rep will modify the e-switch vport state which in turn will make
proper VF drivers to set their carrier accordingly.
