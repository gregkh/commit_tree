firmware: refactor loading status

The firmware loader tracks the current state of the loading process
via unsigned long status and a completion in struct
firmware_buf. Instead of open code tracking the state, introduce data
structure which encapsulate the state tracking and synchronization.

While at it also separate UHM states from direct loading states, e.g.
the loading_timeout is only defined when CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER.
