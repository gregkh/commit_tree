clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Don't assume clock runs in suspend

The ARM specifies that the system counter "must be implemented in an
always-on power domain," and so we try to use the counter as a source of
timekeeping across suspend/resume. Unfortunately, some SoCs (e.g.,
Rockchip's RK3399) do not keep the counter ticking properly when
switched from their high-power clock to the lower-power clock used in
system suspend. Support this quirk by adding a new device tree property.
