list: Split list_del() debug checking into separate function

Similar to the list_add() debug consolidation, this commit consolidates
the debug checking performed during CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST into a new
__list_del_entry_valid() function, and stops list updates when corruption
is found.

Refactored from same hardening in PaX and Grsecurity.
