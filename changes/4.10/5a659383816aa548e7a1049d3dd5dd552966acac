drm/i915: Use binary search when looking for shadowed registers

Simply replace the linear search with the kernel's binary
search implementation. There is only six registers currently
in that table so this may not be that interesting. It adds a
function call so hopefully remains performance neutral for now.

v2: No need for manual conversion to bool for return.
