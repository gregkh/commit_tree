[media] adv7604: add vic detect

Obtain the correct timings based on the VIC code from the AVI InfoFrame.

It does a sanity check to see if at least the measured width and height
are in line with what the VIC code reports. If not, then use the timings
instead of the VIC code (as per the CEA-861 spec).
