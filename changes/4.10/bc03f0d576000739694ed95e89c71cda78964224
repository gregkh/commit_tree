ASoC: sun4i-codec: Expand quirks to handle register offsets and card creation

The A31 has a similar codec to the A10/A20. The PCM parts are very
similar, with just different register offsets. The analog paths are
very different. There are more inputs and outputs.

The A31s, A23, and H3 have a similar PCM interface, again with register
offsets slightly rearranged. The analog path controls, while very
similar between them and the A31, have been moved a separate bus which
is accessed through a message box like interface in the PRCM address
range. This would be handled by a separate auxiliary device tied in
through the device tree in its supporting create_card function.

The quirks structure is expanded to include different register offsets
and separate callbacks for creating the ASoC card. The regmap_config,
quirks, and of_device_match tables have been moved to facilitate this.
