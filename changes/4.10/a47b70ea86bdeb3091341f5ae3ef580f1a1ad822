ravb: unmap descriptors when freeing rings

"swiotlb buffer is full" errors occur after repeated initialisation of a
device - f.e. suspend/resume or ip link set up/down. This is because memory
mapped using dma_map_single() in ravb_ring_format() and ravb_start_xmit()
is not released.  Resolve this problem by unmapping descriptors when
freeing rings.
