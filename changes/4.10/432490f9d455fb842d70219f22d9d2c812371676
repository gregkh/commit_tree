net: ip, diag -- Add diag interface for raw sockets

In criu we are actively using diag interface to collect sockets
present in the system when dumping applications. And while for
unix, tcp, udp[lite], packet, netlink it works as expected,
the raw sockets do not have. Thus add it.

v2:
 - add missing sock_put calls in raw_diag_dump_one (by eric.dumazet@)
 - implement @destroy for diag requests (by dsa@)

v3:
 - add export of raw_abort for IPv6 (by dsa@)
 - pass net-admin flag into inet_sk_diag_fill due to
   changes in net-next branch (by dsa@)

v4:
 - use @pad in struct inet_diag_req_v2 for raw socket
   protocol specification: raw module carries sockets
   which may have custom protocol passed from socket()
   syscall and sole @sdiag_protocol is not enough to
   match underlied ones
 - start reporting protocol specifed in socket() call
   when sockets are raw ones for the same reason: user
   space tools like ss may parse this attribute and use
   it for socket matching

v5 (by eric.dumazet@):
 - use sock_hold in raw_sock_get instead of atomic_inc,
   we're holding (raw_v4_hashinfo|raw_v6_hashinfo)->lock
   when looking up so counter won't be zero here.

v6:
 - use sdiag_raw_protocol() helper which will access @pad
   structure used for raw sockets protocol specification:
   we can't simply rename this member without breaking uapi

v7:
 - sine sdiag_raw_protocol() helper is not suitable for
   uapi lets rather make an alias structure with proper
   names. __check_inet_diag_req_raw helper will catch
   if any of structure unintentionally changed.
