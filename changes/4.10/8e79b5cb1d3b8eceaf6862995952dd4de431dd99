lightnvm: move block provisioning to targets

In order to naturally support multi-target instances on an Open-Channel
SSD, targets should own the LUNs they get blocks from and manage
provisioning internally. This is done in several steps.

This patch moves the block provisioning inside of the target and removes
the get/put block interface from the media manager.
