block: Implement support for zoned block devices

Implement zoned block device zone information reporting and reset.
Zone information are reported as struct blk_zone. This implementation
does not differentiate between host-aware and host-managed device
models and is valid for both. Two functions are provided:
blkdev_report_zones for discovering the zone configuration of a
zoned block device, and blkdev_reset_zones for resetting the write
pointer of sequential zones. The helper function blk_queue_zone_size
and bdev_zone_size are also provided for, as the name suggest,
obtaining the zone size (in 512B sectors) of the zones of the device.
