mwifiex: fix p2p device doesn't find in scan problem

Marvell p2p device disappears from the list of p2p peers on the other
p2p device after disconnection.

It happens due to a bug in driver. When interface is changed from p2p
to station, certain variables(bss_type, bss_role etc.) aren't correctly
updated. This patch corrects them to fix the issue.
