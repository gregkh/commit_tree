Revert "bcma: init serial console directly from ChipCommon code"

This reverts commit 4c81acab3816 ("bcma: init serial console directly
from ChipCommon code") as it broke IRQ assignment. Getting IRQ with
bcma_core_irq helper on SoC requires MIPS core to be set. It happens
*after* ChipCommon initialization so we can't do this so early.

This fixes a user reported regression. It wasn't critical as serial was
still somehow working but lack of IRQs was making in unreliable.
