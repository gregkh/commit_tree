netfilter: deprecate NF_STOP

NF_STOP is only used by br_netfilter these days, and it can be emulated
with a combination of NF_STOLEN plus explicit call to the ->okfn()
function as Florian suggests.

To retain binary compatibility with userspace nf_queue application, we
have to keep NF_STOP around, so libnetfilter_queue userspace userspace
applications still work if they use NF_STOP for some exotic reason.

Out of tree modules using NF_STOP would break, but we don't care about
those.
