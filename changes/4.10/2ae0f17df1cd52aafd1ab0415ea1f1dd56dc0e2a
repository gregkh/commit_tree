genetlink: use idr to track families

Since generic netlink family IDs are small integers, allocated
densely, IDR is an ideal match for lookups. Replace the existing
hand-written hash-table with IDR for allocation and lookup.

This lets the families only be written to once, during register,
since the list_head can be removed and removal of a family won't
cause any writes.

It also slightly reduces the code size (by about 1.3k on x86-64).
