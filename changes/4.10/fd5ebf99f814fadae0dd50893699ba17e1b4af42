arm/arm64: KVM: Clean up useless code in kvm_timer_enable

1) Since commit:41a54482 changed timer enabled variable to per-vcpu,
   the correlative comment in kvm_timer_enable is useless now.

2) After the kvm module init successfully, the timecounter is always
   non-null, so we can remove the checking of timercounter.
