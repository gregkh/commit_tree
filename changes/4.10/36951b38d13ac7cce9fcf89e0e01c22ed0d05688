f2fs: don't wait writeback for datas during checkpoint

Normally, while committing checkpoint, we will wait on all pages to be
writebacked no matter the page is data or metadata, so in scenario where
there are lots of data IO being submitted with metadata, we may suffer
long latency for waiting writeback during checkpoint.

Indeed, we only care about persistence for pages with metadata, but not
pages with data, as file system consistent are only related to metadate,
so in order to avoid encountering long latency in above scenario, let's
recognize and reference metadata in submitted IOs, wait writeback only
for metadatas.
