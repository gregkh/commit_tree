net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Do not clobber b53_switch_ops

We make the bcm_sf2 driver override ds->ops which points to
b53_switch_ops since b53_switch_alloc() did the assignent. This is all
well and good until a second b53 switch comes in, and ends up using the
bcm_sf2 operations. Make a proper local copy, substitute the ds->ops
pointer and then override the operations.
