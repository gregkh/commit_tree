drm/i915/dp: add lane_count check in intel_dp_check_link_status

Currently it's entirely possible to go through the link training step
without first determining the lane_count, which is silly since we end up
doing a bunch of aux transfers of size = 0, as highlighted by
WARN_ON(!msg->buffer != !msg->size), and can only ever result in a
'failed to update link training' message. This can be observed during
intel_dp_long_pulse where we can do the link training step, but before
we have had a chance to set the link params. To avoid this we add an
extra check for the lane_count in intel_dp_check_link_status, which
should prevent us from doing the link training step prematurely.

v2: add WARN_ON_ONCE and FIXME comment (Ville)
