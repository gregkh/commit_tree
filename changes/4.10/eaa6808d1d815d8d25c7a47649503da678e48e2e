[media] media: ti-vpe: vpdma: Corrected YUV422 data type label

The YUV data type definition below are taken from
both the TRM and i839 Errata information.
Use the correct data type considering byte
reordering of components.

Added the 2 missing YUV422 variant.
Also since the single use of "C" in the 422 case
to mean "Cr" (i.e. V component). It was decided
to explicitly label them CR to remove any confusion.
Bear in mind that the type label refer to the memory
packed order (LSB - MSB).
