reservation: revert "wait only with non-zero timeout specified (v3)" v2

Reverts commit fb8b7d2b9d80
	("reservation: wait only with non-zero timeout specified (v3)")

Otherwise signaling might never be activated on the fences. This can
result in infinite waiting with hardware which has unreliable interrupts.

v2: still return one when the timeout is zero and we don't have any fences.
