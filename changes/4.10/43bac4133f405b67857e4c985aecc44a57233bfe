Changelog:
V1 -> V5: generic settings is shared in bcm283x.dtsi, but disabled
	  moved the compatible string to the SOC specific dtsi
            for arm and arm64
V5 -> V6: fix remove 0x prefix from thermal@0x7e212000

Note: there is no arm/boot/dts/bcm2837.dtsi as of now,
      so the 32-bit rpi3 dt is not modified.
