dm raid: fix discard support regression

Commit ecbfb9f118 ("dm raid: add raid level takeover support") moved the
configure_discard_support() call from raid_ctr() to raid_preresume().

Enabling/disabling discard _must_ happen during table load (through the
.ctr hook).  Fix this regression by moving the
configure_discard_support() call back to raid_ctr().
