nvme: lightnvm: frees wrong cmd structure

When struct nvme_request was introduced, the nvme_nvm_submit_io was
converted to the new interface. The interface moves nvme_nvm_command
data structure into the struct request pdu. On io completion, rq->cmd is
freed, which should have been the dereferenced pdu nvme_request->cmd.
