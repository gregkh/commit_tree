tools lib bpf: Add bpf_prog_{attach,detach}

Commit d8c5b17f2bc0 ("samples: bpf: add userspace example for attaching
eBPF programs to cgroups") added these functions to samples/libbpf, but
during this merge all of the samples libbpf functionality is shifting to
tools/lib/bpf. Shift these functions there.

Committer notes:

Use bzero + attr.FIELD = value instead of 'attr = { .FIELD = value, just
like the other wrapper calls to sys_bpf with bpf_attr to make this build
in older toolchais, such as the ones in CentOS 5 and 6.
