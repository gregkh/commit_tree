dax: move RADIX_DAX_* defines to dax.h

The RADIX_DAX_* defines currently mostly live in fs/dax.c, with just
RADIX_DAX_ENTRY_LOCK being in include/linux/dax.h so it can be used in
mm/filemap.c.  When we add PMD support, though, mm/filemap.c will also need
access to the RADIX_DAX_PTE type so it can properly construct a 4k sized
empty entry.

Instead of shifting the defines between dax.c and dax.h as they are
individually used in other code, just move them wholesale to dax.h so
they'll be available when we need them.
