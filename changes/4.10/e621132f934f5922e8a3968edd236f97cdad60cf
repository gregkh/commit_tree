Input: synaptics-rmi4 - f03 - grab data passed by transport device

First check if there are data available passed by the transport device.
If data available use these data. If there are no data available
try to read the rmi block if dsata are passed this way.

This is the way the other rmi function handlers will do this.

This patch is needed on HID devices because the firmware reads F03 data
registers and adds them to the HID attention report. Reading those
registers from the driver after the firmware read them will result in
invalid data.
