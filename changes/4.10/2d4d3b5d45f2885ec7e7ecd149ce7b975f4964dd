blackfin: make-bf561/coreb.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config BF561_COREB
        bool "Enable Core B loader"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_misc_device translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
