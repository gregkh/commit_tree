builddeb: fix cross-building to arm64 producing host-arch debs

Both Debian and kernel archs are "arm64" but UTS_MACHINE and gcc say
"aarch64".  Recognizing just the latter should be enough but let's
accept both in case something regresses again or an user sets
UTS_MACHINE=arm64.

Regressed in cfa88c7: arm64: Set UTS_MACHINE in the Makefile.
