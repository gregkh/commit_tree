cgroup: add support for eBPF programs

This patch adds two sets of eBPF program pointers to struct cgroup.
One for such that are directly pinned to a cgroup, and one for such
that are effective for it.

To illustrate the logic behind that, assume the following example
cgroup hierarchy.

  A - B - C
        \ D - E

If only B has a program attached, it will be effective for B, C, D
and E. If D then attaches a program itself, that will be effective for
both D and E, and the program in B will only affect B and C. Only one
program of a given type is effective for a cgroup.

Attaching and detaching programs will be done through the bpf(2)
syscall. For now, ingress and egress inet socket filtering are the
only supported use-cases.
