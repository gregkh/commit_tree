perf jit: Add unwinding support

This record is intended to provide unwinding information in the
eh_frame format. This is required to unwind JITed code which
does not maintain the frame pointer register during function calls.

The eh_frame unwinding information can be emitted by V8 / Chromium
when the --perf_prof_unwinding_info is passed.

A record of type jr_code_unwinding_info comes before the jr_code_load
it referred to and contains both the .eh_frame and .eh_frame_hdr.

The fields in the header have the following meaning:

  * unwinding_size: size of the eh_frame and eh_frame_hdr, necessary
    for distinguishing the content from the padding.

  * eh_frame_hdr_size: as the name says.

  * mapped_size: size of the payload that was in memory at runtime.
    typically unwinding_size if the .eh_frame_hdr and .eh_frame were
    mapped, or 0 if they weren't. It should always be the former case,
    since the .eh_frame is guaranteed to be mapped in memory. However,
    certain JITs might want to inject an .eh_frame_hdr with an empty LUT
    to trigger fp-based unwinding fallback in libunwind. The only part
    of the .eh_frame_hdr that libunwind reads from remote memory is the
    LUT, and since there is none, mapping the unwinding info in memory
    is not necessary, and 0 in this field signifies that it wasn't.
    This practical hack allows to save bytes in code memory for those
    JIT compilers that might or might not maintain a valid frame pointer.

The payload that follows is assumed to contain first the .eh_frame and
then the .eh_header_hdr, with no padding between the two.
