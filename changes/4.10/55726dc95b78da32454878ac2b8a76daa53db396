ASoC: topology: Make PCM backward compatible from ABI v4

This patch adds support for old version 4 of PCMs (FE DAI & DAI links).

Topology ABI v5 added new fields to stream caps and thus changed PCMs.
Since user space may still uses v4, kernel will check the ABI version by
comparing the object size. If user space uses v4 of PCMs, kernel will
create the latest version of PCMs from the old version, and use the new
version internally to create FE DAI & DAI links. Because these new created
PCM elements will be freed later, kernel need duplicate the name strings
of DAI driver and DAI links when creating them.
