drivers: base: cacheinfo: support DT overrides for cache properties

Few architectures like x86, ia64 and s390 derive the cache topology and
all the properties using a specific architected mechanism while some
other architectures like powerpc all those information id derived from
the device tree.

On ARM, both the mechanism is used. While all the cache properties can
be derived in a architected way, it needs to rely on device tree to get
the cache topology information.

However there are few platforms where this architected mechanism is
broken and the device tree properties can be used to override these
incorrect values.

This patch adds support for overriding the cache properties values to
the values specified in the device tree.
