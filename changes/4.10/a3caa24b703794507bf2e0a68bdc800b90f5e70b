ext4: only set S_DAX if DAX is really supported

Currently we have S_DAX set inode->i_flags for a regular file whenever
ext4 is mounted with dax mount option. However in some cases we cannot
really do DAX - e.g. when inode is marked to use data journalling, when
inode data is being encrypted, or when inode is stored inline. Make sure
S_DAX flag is appropriately set/cleared in these cases.
