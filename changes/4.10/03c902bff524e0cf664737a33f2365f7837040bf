iwlwifi: mvm: avoid crash on restart w/o reserved queues

When the firmware restarts in a situation in which any station
has no queue reserved anymore because that queue was used, the
code will crash trying to access the queue_info array at the
offset 255, which is far too big. Fix this by checking that a
queue is actually reserved before writing its status.
