drm/i915: don't leak global_timeline

We need to clean up the global_timeline in i915_gem_load_cleanup.

v2: don't forget about the struct_mutex, and also WARN_ON if we have any
remaining timelines before purging the global_timeline.

v3: it might be a good idea to first remove the global_timeline...duh!
