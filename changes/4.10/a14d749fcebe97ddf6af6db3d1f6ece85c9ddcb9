virtio_blk: avoid DMA to stack for the sense buffer

Most users of BLOCK_PC requests allocate the sense buffer on the stack,
so to avoid DMA to the stack copy them to a field in the heap allocated
virtblk_req structure.  Without that any attempt at SCSI passthrough I/O,
including the SG_IO ioctl from userspace will crash the kernel.  Note that
this includes running tools like hdparm even when the host does not have
SCSI passthrough enabled.
