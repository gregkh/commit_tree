qxl: Don't notify userspace when monitors config is unchanged

When the QXL driver receives a QXL_INTERRUPT_CLIENT_MONITORS_CONFIG interrupt,
we currently always notify userspace that there was some hotplug event.

However, gnome-shell/mutter is reacting to this event by attempting a
resolution change, which it does by issueing drmModeRmFB, drmModeAddFB,
and then drmModeSetCrtc. This has the side-effect of causing
qxl_crtc_mode_set() to tell the QXL virtual hardware that a primary
surface was destroyed and created. After going through QEMU and then the
remote SPICE client, a new identical monitors config message will be
sent, resulting in a QXL_INTERRUPT_CLIENT_MONITORS_CONFIG interrupt to
be emitted, and the same scenario occurring again.

As destroying/creating the primary surface causes a visible screen
flicker, this makes the guest hard to use (
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1266484 ).

This commit checks if the screen configuration we received is the same
one as the current one, and does not notify userspace about it if that's
the case.
