powerpc/iommu: Stop using @current in mm_iommu_xxx

This changes mm_iommu_xxx helpers to take mm_struct as a parameter
instead of getting it from @current which in some situations may
not have a valid reference to mm.

This changes helpers to receive @mm and moves all references to @current
to the caller, including checks for !current and !current->mm;
checks in mm_iommu_preregistered() are removed as there is no caller
yet.

This moves the mm_iommu_adjust_locked_vm() call to the caller as
it receives mm_iommu_table_group_mem_t but it needs mm.

This should cause no behavioral change.
