i40e: Blink LED on 1G BaseT boards

Before this patch "ethtool -p" was not blinking the LEDs on boards
with 1G BaseT PHYs.

This commit identifies 1G BaseT boards as having the LEDs connected
to the MAC. Also, renamed the flag to be more descriptive of usage.
The flag is now I40E_FLAG_PHY_CONTROLS_LEDS.
