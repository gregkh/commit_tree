drm/i915: Move frontbuffer CS write tracking from ggtt vma to object

I tried to avoid having to track the write for every VMA by only
tracking writes to the ggtt. However, for the purposes of frontbuffer
tracking this is insufficient as we need to invalidate around writes not
just to the the ggtt but all aliased ppgtt views of the framebuffer. By
moving the critical section to the object and only doing so for
framebuffer writes we can reduce the tracking even further by only
watching framebuffers and not vma.
