md: stop write should stop journal reclaim

__md_stop_writes currently doesn't stop raid5-cache reclaim thread. It's
possible the reclaim thread is still running and doing write, which
doesn't match what __md_stop_writes should do. The extra ->quiesce()
call should not harm any raid types. For raid5-cache, this will
guarantee we reclaim all caches before we update superblock.
