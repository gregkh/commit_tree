drivers: base: cacheinfo: fix boot error message when acpi is enabled

ARM64 enables both CONFIG_OF and CONFIG_ACPI and the firmware can pass
both ACPI tables and the device tree. Based on the kernel parameter, one
of the two will be chosen. If acpi is enabled, then device tree is not
unflattened.

Currently ARM64 platforms report:
"
	Failed to find cpu0 device node
	Unable to detect cache hierarchy from DT for CPU 0
"
which is incorrect when booting with ACPI. Also latest ACPI v6.1 has no
support for cache properties/hierarchy.

This patch adds check for unflattened device tree and also returns as
"not supported" if ACPI is runtime enabled.

It also removes the reference to DT from the error message as the cache
hierarchy can be detected from the firmware(OF/DT/ACPI)
