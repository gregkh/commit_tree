netronome: don't access real_num_rx_queues directly

The netdev->real_num_rx_queues setting is only available if CONFIG_SYSFS
is enabled, so we now get a build failure when that is turned off:

netronome/nfp/nfp_net_common.c: In function 'nfp_net_ring_swap_enable':
netronome/nfp/nfp_net_common.c:2489:18: error: 'struct net_device' has no member named 'real_num_rx_queues'; did you mean 'real_num_tx_queues'?

As far as I can tell, the check here is only used as an optimization that
we can skip in order to fix the compilation. If sysfs is disabled,
the following netif_set_real_num_rx_queues() has no effect.
