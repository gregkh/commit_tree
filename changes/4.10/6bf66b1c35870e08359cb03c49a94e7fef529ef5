ASoC: rsnd: tidyup ssi->usrcnt counter check in hw_params

ssi->usrcnt will be updated on snd_soc_dai_ops::trigger,
but snd_pcm_ops::hw_params will be called *before* it.
Thus, ssi->usrcnt is still 0 when 1st call.
rsnd_ssi_hw_params() needs to check its called count, this means
trigger should be if (ssi->usrcnt) instead of if (ssi->usrcnt > 1).
