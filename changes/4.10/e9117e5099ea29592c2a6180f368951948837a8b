sfc: Firmware-Assisted TSO version 2

Add support for FATSOv2 to the driver. FATSOv2 offloads far more of the task
 of TCP segmentation to the firmware, such that we now just pass a single
 super-packet to the NIC. This means TSO has a great deal in common with a
 normal DMA transmit, apart from adding a couple of option descriptors.
 NIC-specific checks have been moved off the fast path and in to
 initialisation where possible.

This also moves FATSOv1/SWTSO to a new file (tx_tso.c).  The end of transmit
 and some error handling is now outside TSO, since it is common with other
 code.
