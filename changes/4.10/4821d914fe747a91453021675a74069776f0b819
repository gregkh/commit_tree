ASoC: rsnd: use dma_sync_single_for_xxx() for IOMMU

IOMMU needs DMA mapping function to use it. One solution is that
we can use DMA mapped dev on snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages_for_all()
for SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV. But pcm_new and dma map timing are mismatched.
Thus, this patch uses SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_CONTINUOUS for pcm_new,
and use dma_sync_single_for_xxx() for each transfer.
