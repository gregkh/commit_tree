batman-adv: Revert "use core MTU range checking in misc drivers"

The maximum MTU is defined via the slave devices of an batman-adv
interface. Thus it is not possible to calculate the max_mtu during the
creation of the batman-adv device when no slave devices are attached. Doing
so would for example break non-fragmentation setups which then
(incorrectly) allow an MTU of 1500 even when underlying device cannot
transport 1500 bytes + batman-adv headers.

Checking the dynamically calculated max_mtu via the minimum of the slave
devices MTU during .ndo_change_mtu is also used by the bridge interface.
