intel_th: Mark sth_stm_packet() with notrace

If CONFIG_STM_SOURCE_FTRACE is selected, Function trace data can be
writen to sink via STM, all functions that related to writing data
packets to STM should be marked 'notrace' to avoid being traced by
Ftrace, otherwise the program would stall into an endless loop.
