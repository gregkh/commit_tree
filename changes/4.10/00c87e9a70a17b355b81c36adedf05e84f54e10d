KVM: x86: do not save guest-unsupported XSAVE state

Saving unsupported state prevents migration when the new host does not
support a XSAVE feature of the original host, even if the feature is not
exposed to the guest.

We've masked host features with guest-visible features before, with
4344ee981e21 ("KVM: x86: only copy XSAVE state for the supported
features") and dropped it when implementing XSAVES.  Do it again.

Fixes: df1daba7d1cb ("KVM: x86: support XSAVES usage in the host")
