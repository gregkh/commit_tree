tracing/rb: Convert to hotplug state machine

Install the callbacks via the state machine. The notifier in struct
ring_buffer is replaced by the multi instance interface.  Upon
__ring_buffer_alloc() invocation, cpuhp_state_add_instance() will invoke
the trace_rb_cpu_prepare() on each CPU.

This callback may now fail. This means __ring_buffer_alloc() will fail and
cleanup (like previously) and during a CPU up event this failure will not
allow the CPU to come up.
