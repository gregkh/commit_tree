platform/x86: Introduce button support for the Surface 3

The Surface 3 is not following the ACPI spec for PNP0C40, but nearly.
The device is connected to a I2C device that might have some magic
but we don't know about.
Just create the device after the enumeration and use the declared GPIOs
to provide button support.

This driver is just an adaptation of drivers/input/misc/soc_button_array.c

The Surface Pro 3 is using an ACPI driver and matches against the bid
of the device ("VGBI"). To prevent this incompatible driver to be used
on the Surface Pro, we add a match on the Surface 3 bid "TEV2".
