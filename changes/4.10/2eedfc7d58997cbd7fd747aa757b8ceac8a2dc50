drm/i915: Remove RPM sequence checking

We only used the RPM sequence checking inside the lowlevel GTT
accessors, when we had to rely on callers taking the wakeref on our
behalf. Now that we take the RPM wakeref inside the GTT management
routines themselves, we can forgo the sanitycheck of the callers.
