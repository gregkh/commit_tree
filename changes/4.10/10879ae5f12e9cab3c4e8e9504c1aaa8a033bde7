serial: pl011: add console matching function

This patch adds function pl011_console_match() that implements
method match of struct console.  It allows to match consoles against
data specified in a string, for example taken from command line or
compiled by ACPI SPCR table handler.

This patch was merged to tty-next but then reverted because of
conflict with

commit 46e36683f433 ("serial: earlycon: Extend earlycon command line option to support 64-bit addresses")

Now it is fixed.
