ARM64: dts: meson-gx: Add firmware reserved memory zones

The Amlogic Meson GXBB/GXL/GXM secure monitor uses part of the memory space,
this patch adds these reserved zones.

Without such reserved memory zones, running the following stress command :
$ stress-ng --vm 16 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 10s
multiple times:

Could lead to the following kernel crashes :
[   46.937975] Bad mode in Error handler detected on CPU1, code 0xbf000000 -- SError
...
[   47.058536] Internal error: Attempting to execute userspace memory: 8600000f [#3] PREEMPT SMP
...
Instead of the OOM killer.
