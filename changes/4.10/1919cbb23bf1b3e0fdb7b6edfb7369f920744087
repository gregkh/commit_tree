md/raid10: add failfast handling for writes.

When writing to a fastfail device, we use MD_FASTFAIL unless
it is the only device being written to.  For
resync/recovery, assume there was a working device to read
from so always use MD_FASTFAIL.

If a write for resync/recovery fails, we just fail the
device - there is not much else to do.

If a normal write fails, but the device cannot be marked
Faulty (must be only one left), we queue for write error
handling which calls narrow_write_error() to write the block
synchronously without any failfast flags.
