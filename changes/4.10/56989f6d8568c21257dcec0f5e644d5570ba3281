genetlink: mark families as __ro_after_init

Now genl_register_family() is the only thing (other than the
users themselves, perhaps, but I didn't find any doing that)
writing to the family struct.

In all families that I found, genl_register_family() is only
called from __init functions (some indirectly, in which case
I've add __init annotations to clarifly things), so all can
actually be marked __ro_after_init.

This protects the data structure from accidental corruption.
