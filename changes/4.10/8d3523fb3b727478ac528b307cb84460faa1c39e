ACPI / osl: Remove deprecated acpi_get_table_with_size()/early_acpi_os_unmap_memory()

Since all users are cleaned up, remove the 2 deprecated APIs due to no
users.
As a Linux variable rather than an ACPICA variable, acpi_gbl_permanent_mmap
is renamed to acpi_permanent_mmap to have a consistent coding style across
entire Linux ACPI subsystem.
