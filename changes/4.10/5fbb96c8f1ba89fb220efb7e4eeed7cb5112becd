scsi: cxlflash: Use cmd_size for private commands

Instead of using a private pool of AFU commands, use cmd_size to prime
the private pool of SCSI commands such that they are allocated with a
size large enough to contain an aligned AFU command. Use scsi_cmd_priv()
to derive the aligned/zeroed private command on queuecommand and TMF
paths. Remove cmd_checkout() as it is no longer required. The remaining
AFU private command infrastructure will be removed in a cleanup commit.
