redo: radix tree test suite: fix compilation

[ This resurrects commit 53855d10f456, which was reverted in
  2b41226b39b6.  It depended on commit d544abd5ff7d ("lib/radix-tree:
  Convert to hotplug state machine") so now it is correct to apply ]

Patch "lib/radix-tree: Convert to hotplug state machine" breaks the test
suite as it adds a call to cpuhp_setup_state_nocalls() which is not
currently emulated in the test suite.  Add it, and delete the emulation
of the old CPU hotplug mechanism.
