ubifs: Introduce new data node field, compr_size

When data of a data node is compressed and encrypted
we need to store the size of the compressed data because
before encryption we may have to add padding bytes.

For the new field we consume the last two padding bytes
in struct ubifs_data_node. Two bytes are fine because
the data length is at most 4096.
