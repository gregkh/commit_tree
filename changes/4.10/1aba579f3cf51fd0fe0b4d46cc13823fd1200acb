cdc-acm: handle read pipe errors

Read urbs are submitted back only on success, causing read pipe
running out of urbs after few errors. No more characters can
be read from tty device then until it is reopened and no errors
are reported.
Fix that by always submitting urbs back and clearing stall on
-EPIPE.
