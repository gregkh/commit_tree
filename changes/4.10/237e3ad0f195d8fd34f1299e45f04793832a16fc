Kconfig: Introduce the "imply" keyword

The "imply" keyword is a weak version of "select" where the target
config symbol can still be turned off, avoiding those pitfalls that come
with the "select" keyword.

This is useful e.g. with multiple drivers that want to indicate their
ability to hook into a secondary subsystem while allowing the user to
configure that subsystem out without also having to unset these drivers.

Currently, the same effect can almost be achieved with:

config DRIVER_A
	tristate

config DRIVER_B
	tristate

config DRIVER_C
	tristate

config DRIVER_D
	tristate

[...]

config SUBSYSTEM_X
	tristate
	default DRIVER_A || DRIVER_B || DRIVER_C || DRIVER_D || [...]

This is unwieldy to maintain especially with a large number of drivers.
Furthermore, there is no easy way to restrict the choice for SUBSYSTEM_X
to y or n, excluding m, when some drivers are built-in. The "select"
keyword allows for excluding m, but it excludes n as well. Hence
this "imply" keyword.  The above becomes:

config DRIVER_A
	tristate
	imply SUBSYSTEM_X

config DRIVER_B
	tristate
	imply SUBSYSTEM_X

[...]

config SUBSYSTEM_X
	tristate

This is much cleaner, and way more flexible than "select". SUBSYSTEM_X
can still be configured out, and it can be set as a module when none of
the drivers are configured in or all of them are modular.
