reset: fix shared reset triggered_count decrement on error

For a shared reset, when the reset is successful, the triggered_count is
incremented when trying to call the reset callback, so that another device
sharing the same reset line won't trigger it again. If the reset has not
been triggered successfully, the trigger_count should be decremented.

The code does the opposite, and decrements the trigger_count on success.
As a consequence, another device sharing the reset will be able to trigger
it again.

Fixed be removing negation in from of the error code of the reset function.
