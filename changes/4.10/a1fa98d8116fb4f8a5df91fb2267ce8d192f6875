hwrng: atmel - disable TRNG during suspend

To fix the over consumption on the VDDCore due to the TRNG enabled,
disable the TRNG during suspend, not only disable the user interface
clock (which is controlled by PMC). Because the user interface clock
is independent from any clock that may be used in the entropy source
logic circuitry.
