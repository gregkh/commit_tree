net: fix harmonize_features() vs NETIF_F_HIGHDMA

Ashizuka reported a highmem oddity and sent a patch for freescale
fec driver.

But the problem root cause is that core networking stack
must ensure no skb with highmem fragment is ever sent through
a device that does not assert NETIF_F_HIGHDMA in its features.

We need to call illegal_highdma() from harmonize_features()
regardless of CSUM checks.
