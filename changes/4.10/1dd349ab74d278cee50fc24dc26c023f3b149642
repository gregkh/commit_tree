tracing: Do not start benchmark on boot up

Trace events are enabled very early on boot up via the boot command line
parameter. The benchmark tool creates a new thread to perform the trace
event benchmarking. But at start up, it is called before scheduling is set
up and because it creates a new thread before the init thread is created,
this crashes the kernel.

Have the benchmark fail to register when started via the kernel command
line.

Also, since the registering of a tracepoint now can handle failure cases,
return -ENOMEM instead of warning if the thread cannot be created.
