ovl: clean up kstat usage

FWIW, there's a bit of abuse of struct kstat in overlayfs object
creation paths - for one thing, it ends up with a very small subset
of struct kstat (mode + rdev), for another it also needs link in
case of symlinks and ends up passing it separately.

IMO it would be better to introduce a separate object for that.

In principle, we might even lift that thing into general API and switch
 ->mkdir()/->mknod()/->symlink() to identical calling conventions.  Hell
knows, perhaps ->create() as well...
