cxl: Do adapter fence check before handling afu interrupt

If an afu interrupt is in flight when an eeh error is triggered the
control still reaches the function native_irq_multiplexed and the
PE-Handle read from the CXL_PSL_PEHandle_An register is 0xffff. The
function then erroneously assumes that the interrupt belonged to a
detached context and generates a warning with full stack dump in the
kernel log complaining:

"Unable to demultiplex CXL PSL IRQ for PE 65535 DSISR ffffffff DAR
ffffffff. (Possible AFU HW issue - was a term/remove acked with
outstanding transactions"

To fix this the patch adds new code to the function
native_irq_multiplexed function to compares the read value of register
CXL_PSL_PEHandle_An to ~0ULL. If true then logs a warning message
saying that the interrupt is being ignored and returns IRQ_HANDLED from
the irq handler.
