nbd: blk_mq_init_queue returns an error code on failure, not NULL

Additionally, don't assign directly to disk->queue, otherwise
blk_put_queue (called via put_disk) will choke (panic) on the errno
stored there.

Bug found by code inspection after Omar found a similar issue in
virtio_blk.  Compile-tested only.
