net: stmmac: replace all pr_xxx by their netdev_xxx counterpart

The stmmac driver use lots of pr_xxx functions to print information.
This is bad since we cannot know which device logs the information.
(moreover if two stmmac device are present)

Furthermore, it seems that it assumes wrongly that all logs will always
be subsequent by using a dev_xxx then some indented pr_xxx like this:
kernel: sun7i-dwmac 1c50000.ethernet: no reset control found
kernel:  Ring mode enabled
kernel:  No HW DMA feature register supported
kernel:  Normal descriptors
kernel:  TX Checksum insertion supported

So this patch replace all pr_xxx by their netdev_xxx counterpart.
Excepts for some printing where netdev "cause" unpretty output like:
sun7i-dwmac 1c50000.ethernet (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): no reset control found
In those case, I keep dev_xxx.

In the same time I remove some "stmmac:" print since
this will be a duplicate with that dev_xxx displays.
