efi/libstub/arm*: Pass latest memory map to the kernel

As reported by James Morse, the current libstub code involving the
annotated memory map only works somewhat correctly by accident, due
to the fact that a pool allocation happens to be reused immediately,
retaining its former contents on most implementations of the
UEFI boot services.

Instead of juggling memory maps, which makes the code more complex than
it needs to be, simply put placeholder values into the FDT for the memory
map parameters, and only write the actual values after ExitBootServices()
has been called.
