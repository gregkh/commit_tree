xfs: factor rmap btree size into the indlen calculations

When we're estimating the amount of space it's going to take to satisfy
a delalloc reservation, we need to include the space that we might need
to grow the rmapbt.  This helps us to avoid running out of space later
when _iomap_write_allocate needs more space than we reserved.  Eryu Guan
observed this happening on generic/224 when sunit/swidth were set.
