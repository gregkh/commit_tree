drm/i915: Allow compaction upto SWIOTLB max segment size

commit 1625e7e549c5 ("drm/i915: make compact dma scatter lists creation
work with SWIOTLB backend") took a heavy handed approach to undo the
scatterlist compaction in the face of SWIOTLB. (The compaction hit a bug
whereby we tried to pass a segment larger than SWIOTLB could handle.) We
can be a little more intelligent and try compacting the scatterlist up
to the maximum SWIOTLB segment size (when using SWIOTLB).

v2: Tidy sg_mark_end() and cpp
