ARM: dts: pxa: fix gpio0 and gpio1 interrupts

Since gpio-pxa was redesigned to differenciate gpio0, gpio1 and the
gpio-mux interrupt as in the hardware IP, the device-tree description
should be amended so that interrupts from gpio0 and gpio1 can be mapped
to consumers.

This is especially true on lubbock and mainstone devices where gpio0 is
multiplexed on pxa_cplds for ethernet, sa1111, usb udc, and other
devices.
