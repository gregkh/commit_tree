kvm/stats: Update kvm stats to clear on write to their debugfs entry

Various kvm vm and vcpu stats are provided via debugfs entries.
Currently there is no way to reset these stats back to zero.

Add the ability to clear (reset back to zero) these stats on a per stat
basis by writing to the debugfs files. Only a write value of 0 is accepted.
