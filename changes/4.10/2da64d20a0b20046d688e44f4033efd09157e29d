vfio/spapr: Fix missing mutex unlock when creating a window

Commit d9c728949ddc ("vfio/spapr: Postpone default window creation")
added an additional exit to the VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_TCE_CREATE case and
made it possible to return from tce_iommu_ioctl() without unlocking
container->lock; this fixes the issue.
