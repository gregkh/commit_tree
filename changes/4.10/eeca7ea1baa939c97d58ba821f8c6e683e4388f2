ext4: use current_time() for inode timestamps

CURRENT_TIME_SEC and CURRENT_TIME are not y2038 safe.
current_time() will be transitioned to be y2038 safe
along with vfs.

current_time() returns timestamps according to the
granularities set in the super_block.
The granularity check in ext4_current_time() to call
current_time() or CURRENT_TIME_SEC is not required.
Use current_time() directly to obtain timestamps
unconditionally, and remove ext4_current_time().

Quota files are assumed to be on the same filesystem.
Hence, use current_time() for these files as well.
