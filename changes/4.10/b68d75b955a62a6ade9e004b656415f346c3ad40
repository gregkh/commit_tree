[media] msp3400-driver: don't use KERN_CONT

Drivers using dev_foo() macro should not use KERN_CONT, as, internally,
those macros work as if all strings were terminated by a \n. So, doing:

	dev_info(&client->dev, "%s ", client->name);
	printk(KERN_CONT "supports radio, mode is autodetect and autoselect");

Would produce the following output:

	msp3400 6-0044: msp3400
	supports radio, mode is autodetect and autoselect

As there's no good reason to use KERN_CONT, let's rewrite the code
to avoid that, allowing this driver to be converted to dev_foo().
