ARM: OMAP2+: Remove legacy data from hwmod for omap3

This data is now coming from device tree so we can remove the
duplicate data. Let's keep the DSS and DMA related things for now
until those have been converted to device tree completely.

While at it, let's also add the trailing commas to data structures
so further processing with scripts will be a bit easier.
