ASoC: hdmi-codec: use unsigned type to structure members with bit-field

This is a fix for Linux 4.10-rc1.

In C language specification, a bit-field is interpreted as a signed or
unsigned integer type consisting of the specified number of bits.

In GCC manual, the range of a signed bit field of N bits is from
-(2^N) / 2 to ((2^N) / 2) - 1
https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html#Bit-Fields

Therefore, when defined as 1 bit-field with signed type, variables can
represents -1 and 0.

The snd-soc-hdmi-codec module includes a structure which has signed type
members with bit-fields. Codes of this module assign 0 and 1 to the
members. This seems to result in implementation-dependent behaviours.

As of v4.10-rc1 merge window, outside of sound subsystem, this structure
is referred by below GPU modules.
 - tda998x
 - sti-drm
 - mediatek-drm-hdmi
 - msm

As long as I review their codes relevant to the structure, the structure
members are used just for condition statements and printk formats.
My proposal of change is a bit intrusive to the printk formats but this
may be acceptable.

Totally, it's reasonable to use unsigned type for the structure members.
This bug is detected by Sparse, static code analyzer with below warnings.
