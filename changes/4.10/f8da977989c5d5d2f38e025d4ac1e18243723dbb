net: ip, diag: include net/inet_sock.h

The newly added raw_diag.c fails to build in some configurations
unless we include this header:

In file included from net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:6:0:
include/net/raw.h:71:21: error: field 'inet' has incomplete type
net/ipv4/raw_diag.c: In function 'raw_diag_dump':
net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:166:29: error: implicit declaration of function 'inet_sk'

Fixes: 432490f9d455 ("net: ip, diag -- Add diag interface for raw sockets")
