tools/power turbostat: remove obsolete -M, -m, -C, -c options

The new --add option has replaced the -M, -m, -C, -c options
Eg.

-M 0x10 is now --add msr0x10,raw
-m 0x10 is now --add msr0x10,raw,u32
-C 0x10 is now --add msr0x10,delta
-c 0x10 is now --add msr0x10,delta,u32

The --add option can be repeated to add any number of counters,
while the previous options were limited to adding one of each type.

In addition, the --add option can accept a column label,
and can also display a counter as a percentage of elapsed cycles.

Eg. --add msr0x3fe,core,percent,MY_CC3
