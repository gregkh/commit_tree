iommu/arm-smmu: Add IORT configuration

In ACPI based systems, in order to be able to create platform
devices and initialize them for ARM SMMU components, the IORT
kernel implementation requires a set of static functions to be
used by the IORT kernel layer to configure platform devices for
ARM SMMU components.

Add static configuration functions to the IORT kernel layer for
the ARM SMMU components, so that the ARM SMMU driver can
initialize its respective platform device by relying on the IORT
kernel infrastructure and by adding a corresponding ACPI device
early probe section entry.
