drm/gma500: use DRM_FB_HELPER_DEFAULT_OPS for fb_ops

This refactoring leads to real functional changes in the driver.

Now the struct psbfb_ops implements two additional members:

       .fb_setcmap     = drm_fb_helper_setcmap,
       .fb_pan_display = drm_fb_helper_pan_display,

and the struct psbfb_roll_ops implements one additional member:

       .fb_setcmap     = drm_fb_helper_setcmap,

and the struct psbfb_unaccel_ops implements two additional members:

       .fb_setcmap     = drm_fb_helper_setcmap,
       .fb_pan_display = drm_fb_helper_pan_display,

These changes are not tested.
