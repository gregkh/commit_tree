platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Initialize local in_tablet_mode and type

linux-next reported in_tablet_mode and type may be used uninitialized
after:

b31800283868 ("platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Move tablet detection into separate function")

This turns out to be a false positive as the pr_info call cannot be
reached if tp_features.hotkey_tablet (global scope) is 0, and
in_tablet_mode and type are assigned in both places
tp_features.hotkey_tablet is assigned.

Regardless, to make it explicit and avoid further reports, initialize
in_tablet_mode to 0 and type to NULL.
