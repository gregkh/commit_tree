IB/core: Save QP in ib_flow structure

When we create flow steering rule, we need to save the related QP in the
ib_flow struct. this QP is used in destroy flow.

Move the QP assignment from ib_uverbs_ex_create_flow into ib_create_flow,
this would allow both kernel and userspace consumers to use it.

This bug wasn't seen in the wild because there are no kernel consumers
currently in the kernel.
