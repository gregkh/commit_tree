dmaengine: tegra210-adma: convert TEGRA210_ADMA from bool to tristate

This driver currently uses modular infrastructure but is controlled
by a bool Kconfig.

There is a general consensus from the DMA reviewers and maintainers
that "if it can be modular, it should be modular" in order to keep
the bzImage size under control for multi platform kernels.

Build tested only.  Also needed some new pm_clk symbols exported
before this commit is applied to tree in order to avoid modpost
errors like:

  ERROR: "pm_clk_add_clk" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_create" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_destroy" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_suspend" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_resume" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!

These were added as exports in the v4.8-rc1 merge window.
