platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: use brightness_set_blocking for LED-setting callbacks

All LED-setting functions in fujitsu-laptop are currently assigned to
the brightness_set callback, which is incorrect because they can sleep
(due to their use of call_fext_func(), which in turn issues ACPI calls)
and the documentation (in include/linux/leds.h) clearly states they must
not.  Assign them to brightness_set_blocking instead and change them to
match the expected function prototype.

This change makes it possible to use Fujitsu-specific LEDs with "heavy"
triggers, like disk-activity or phy0rx.
