btrfs: fix crash when tracepoint arguments are freed by wq callbacks

Enabling btrfs tracepoints leads to instant crash, as reported. The wq
callbacks could free the memory and the tracepoints started to
dereference the members to get to fs_info.

The proposed fix https://marc.info/?l=linux-btrfs&m=148172436722606&w=2
removed the tracepoints but we could preserve them by passing only the
required data in a safe way.
