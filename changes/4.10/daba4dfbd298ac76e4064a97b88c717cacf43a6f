[media] exynos-gsc: don't clear format when freeing buffers with REQBUFS(0)

User-space applications can use the VIDIOC_REQBUFS ioctl to determine if a
memory mapped, user pointer or DMABUF based I/O is supported by a driver.

For example, GStreamer attempts to determine the I/O methods supported by
the driver by doing many VIDIOC_REQBUFS ioctl calls with different memory
types and count 0. And then the real VIDIOC_REQBUFS call with count == n
is be made to allocate the buffers. But for count 0, the driver not only
frees the buffers but also clears the format set before with VIDIOC_S_FMT.

This is a problem since STREAMON fails if a format isn't set but GStreamer
first sets a format and then tries to determine the supported I/O methods,
so the format will be cleared on REQBUFS(0), before the call to STREAMON.

To avoid this issue, only free the buffers on VIDIOC_REQBUFS(0) but don't
clear the format. Since is completely valid to set the format and then do
different calls to REQBUFS before a call to STREAMON.
