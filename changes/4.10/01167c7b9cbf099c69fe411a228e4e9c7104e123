mmc: mxs-mmc: Fix additional cycles after transmission stop

According to the code the intention is to append 8 SCK cycles
instead of 4 at end of a MMC_STOP_TRANSMISSION command. But this
will never happened because it's an AC command not an ADTC command.
So fix this by moving the statement into the right function.
