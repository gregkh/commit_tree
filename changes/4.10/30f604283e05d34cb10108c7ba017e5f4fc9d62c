PM / Domains: Allow domain power states to be read from DT

This patch allows domains to define idle states in the DT. SoC's can
define domain idle states in DT using the "domain-idle-states" property
of the domain provider. Add API to read the idle states from DT that can
be set in the genpd object.

This patch is based on the original patch by Marc Titinger.
