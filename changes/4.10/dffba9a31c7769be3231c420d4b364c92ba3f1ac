x86/fpu/xstate: Fix xcomp_bv in XSAVES header

The compacted-format XSAVES area is determined at boot time and
never changed after.  The field xsave.header.xcomp_bv indicates
which components are in the fixed XSAVES format.

In fpstate_init() we did not set xcomp_bv to reflect the XSAVES
format since at the time there is no valid data.

However, after we do copy_init_fpstate_to_fpregs() in fpu__clear(),
as in commit:

  b22cbe404a9c x86/fpu: Fix invalid FPU ptrace state after execve()

and when __fpu_restore_sig() does fpu__restore() for a COMPAT-mode
app, a #GP occurs.  This can be easily triggered by doing valgrind on
a COMPAT-mode "Hello World," as reported by Joakim Tjernlund and
others:

	https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190061

Fix it by setting xcomp_bv correctly.

This patch also moves the xcomp_bv initialization to the proper
place, which was in copyin_to_xsaves() as of:

  4c833368f0bf x86/fpu: Set the xcomp_bv when we fake up a XSAVES area

which fixed the bug too, but it's more efficient and cleaner to
initialize things once per boot, not for every signal handling
operation.
