virtio-net: forbid XDP when VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_UFO is support

When VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_UFO is negotiated, host could still send UFO
packet that exceeds a single page which could not be handled
correctly by XDP. So this patch forbids setting XDP when GUEST_UFO is
supported. While at it, forbid XDP for ECN (which comes only from GRO)
too to prevent user from misconfiguration.
