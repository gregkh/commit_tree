ipv6: fix ip6_tnl_parse_tlv_enc_lim()

This function suffers from multiple issues.

First one is that pskb_may_pull() may reallocate skb->head,
so the 'raw' pointer needs either to be reloaded or not used at all.

Second issue is that NEXTHDR_DEST handling does not validate
that the options are present in skb->data, so we might read
garbage or access non existent memory.

With help from Willem de Bruijn.
