staging: most: hdm-usb: do h/w specific synchronization at configuration time

This patch puts the synchronization procedure trigger for asynchronous
channels into the function hdm_configure_channel. Likewise, it removes
triggering of hardware specific synchronization for other channel types
from the probe function as it is not required.
