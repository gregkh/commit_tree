net/mlx4_core: Avoid command timeouts during VF driver device shutdown

Some Hypervisors detach VFs from VMs by instantly causing an FLR event
to be generated for a VF.

In the mlx4 case, this will cause that VF's comm channel to be disabled
before the VM has an opportunity to invoke the VF device's "shutdown"
method.

The result is that the VF driver on the VM will experience a command
timeout during the shutdown process when the Hypervisor does not deliver
a command-completion event to the VM.

To avoid FW command timeouts on the VM when the driver's shutdown method
is invoked, we detect the absence of the VF's comm channel at the very
start of the shutdown process. If the comm-channel has already been
disabled, we cause all FW commands during the device shutdown process to
immediately return success (and thus avoid all command timeouts).
