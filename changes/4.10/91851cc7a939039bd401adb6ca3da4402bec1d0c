ath9k: fix ath9k_hw_gpio_get() to return 0 or 1 on success

Commit b2d70d4944c1 ("ath9k: make GPIO API to support both of WMAC and
SOC") refactored ath9k_hw_gpio_get() to support both WMAC and SOC GPIOs,
changing the return on success from 1 to BIT(gpio). This broke some callers
like ath_is_rfkill_set(). This doesn't fix any known bug in mainline at the
moment, but should be fixed anyway.

Instead of fixing all callers, change ath9k_hw_gpio_get() back to only
return 0 or 1.
