i7300_idle: Remove this driver

In preparation for removing the idle_notifier, remove its only user, the
i7300_idle driver.

i7300_idle was deployed in 2008 to reduce idle memory power on systems
using the i7300 chipset.  The driver worked by throttling the
fully-buffered DIMMs during idle periods using the IOAT DMA engine.

The driver ran only on the i7300 chip-set, and no other hardware has used
this mechanism.  The driver no longer has a maintainer.

Removing this driver will increase idle power on i7300 systems when they
run the new kernel without the driver.
