drm/i915: Limit Valleyview and earlier to only using mappable scanout

Valleyview appears to be limited to only scanning out from the first 512MiB
of the Global GTT. Lets presume that this behaviour was inherited from the
display block copied from g4x (not Ironlake) and all earlier generations
are similarly affected, though testing suggests different symptoms. For
simplicity, impose that these platforms must scanout from the mappable
region. (For extra simplicity, use HAS_GMCH_DISPLAY even though this
catches Cherryview which does not appear to be limited to the low
aperture for its scanout.)

v2: Use HAS_GMCH_DISPLAY() to more clearly convey my intent about
limiting this workaround to the old style of display engine.

v3: Update changelog to reflect testing by Ville Syrjälä
v4: Include the changes to the comments as well
