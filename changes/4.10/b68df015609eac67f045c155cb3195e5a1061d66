virtio_net: use dev_kfree_skb for small buffer XDP receive

In the small buffer case during driver unload we currently use
put_page instead of dev_kfree_skb. Resolve this by adding a check
for virtnet mode when checking XDP queue type. Also name the
function so that the code reads correctly to match the additional
check.
