debugfs: improve DEFINE_DEBUGFS_ATTRIBUTE for !CONFIG_DEBUG_FS

The slp_s0_residency_usec debugfs file currently uses
DEFINE_DEBUGFS_ATTRIBUTE(), but that macro cannot really be used to
define files outside of the debugfs code, as it has no reference to
the get/set functions if CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is not defined:

drivers/platform/x86/intel_pmc_core.c:80:12: error: ‘pmc_core_dev_state_get’ defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

This fixes the macro to always contain the reference, and instead rely
on the stubbed-out debugfs_create_file to not actually refer to
its arguments so the compiler can still drop the reference.
This works because the attribute definition is always 'static',
and the dead-code removal silently drops all static symbols
that are not used.

Fixes: df2294fb6428 ("intel_pmc_core: Convert to DEFINE_DEBUGFS_ATTRIBUTE")

[nicstange@gmail.com: Add dummy implementations of debugfs_attr_read() and
  debugfs_attr_write() in order to protect against possibly broken dead
  code elimination and to improve readability.
  Correct CONFIG_DEBUGFS_FS -> CONFIG_DEBUG_FS typo in changelog.]
