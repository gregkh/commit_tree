EDAC, altera: Disable IRQs while injecting SDRAM errors

Disable IRQs while injecting SDRAM errors. The RT patches exposed
a spinlock deadlock where the spinlock taken for the regmap write
deadlocked with the IRQ clear regmap write.

Error injection is not normally enabled for ECC but only for testing.
