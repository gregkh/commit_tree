PCI: Create revision file in sysfs

Currently the revision isn't available via sysfs/libudev thus if one wants
to know the value one needs to read through the config file, which can be
quite time-consuming because it wakes/powers up the device.

There are at least two userspace components which could make use the new
file: libpciaccess and libdrm.  The former wakes up _every_ PCI device,
which can be observed via glxinfo when using Mesa 10.0+ drivers.  The
latter, in association with Mesa 13.0, can lead to 2-3 second delays while
starting firefox, thunderbird or chromium.
