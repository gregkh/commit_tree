do_direct_IO: Use inode->i_blkbits to compute block count to be cleaned

The code currently uses sdio->blkbits to compute the number of blocks to
be cleaned. However sdio->blkbits is derived from the logical block size
of the underlying block device (Refer to the definition of
do_blockdev_direct_IO()). Due to this, generic/299 test would rarely
fail when executed on an ext4 filesystem with 64k as the block size and
when using a virtio based disk (having 512 byte as the logical block
size) inside a kvm guest.

This commit fixes the bug by using inode->i_blkbits to compute the
number of blocks to be cleaned.

Fixed up by Jeff Moyer to only use/evaluate inode->i_blkbits once,
to avoid issues with block size changes with IO in flight.
