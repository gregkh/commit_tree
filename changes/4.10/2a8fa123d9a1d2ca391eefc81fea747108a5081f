cpufreq: Remove CPU hotplug callbacks only if they were initialized

Since CPU hotplug callbacks are requested for CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN state,
successful callback initialization will result in cpuhp_setup_state()
returning a positive value. Therefore acpi_cpufreq_online being zero
indicates that callbacks have not been installed.

This means that acpi_cpufreq_boost_exit() should only remove them if
acpi_cpufreq_online is positive. Trying to call
cpuhp_remove_state_nocalls(0) will cause a BUG().
