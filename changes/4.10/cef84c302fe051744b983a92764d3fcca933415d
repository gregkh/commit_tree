KVM: x86: flush pending lapic jump label updates on module unload

KVM's lapic emulation uses static_key_deferred (apic_{hw,sw}_disabled).
These are implemented with delayed_work structs which can still be
pending when the KVM module is unloaded. We've seen this cause kernel
panics when the kvm_intel module is quickly reloaded.

Use the new static_key_deferred_flush() API to flush pending updates on
module unload.
