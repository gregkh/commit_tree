drm/i915: Split out i915_vma.c

As a side product, had to split two other files;
- i915_gem_fence_reg.h
- i915_gem_object.h (only parts that needed immediate untanglement)

I tried to move code in as big chunks as possible, to make review
easier. i915_vma_compare was moved to a header temporarily.

v2:
- Use i915_gem_fence_reg.{c,h}

v3:
- Rebased

v4:
- Fix building when DEBUG_GEM is enabled by reordering a bit.
