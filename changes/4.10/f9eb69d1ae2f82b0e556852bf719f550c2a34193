rtc: jz4740: Add support for acting as the system power controller

The 'system-power-controller' singleton entry can be used in the
devicetree node of the jz4740-rtc driver to specify that the driver is
granted the right to power off the system through the registers of the
RTC unit.

See the documentation for more details:
