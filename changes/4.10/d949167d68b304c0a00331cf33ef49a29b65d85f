IB/mlx5: Report mlx5 packet pacing capabilities when querying device

Enable mlx5 based hardware to report packet pacing capabilities
from kernel to user space. Packet pacing allows to limit the rate to any
number between the maximum and minimum, based on user settings.

The capabilities are exposed to user space through query_device by uhw.
The following capabilities are reported:

1. The maximum and minimum rate limit in kbps supported by packet pacing.
2. Bitmap showing which QP types are supported by packet pacing operation.
