scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh: Fix address line detection on x86

Kirill reported that the decode_stacktrace.sh script was broken by the
following commit:

  bb5e5ce545f2 ("x86/dumpstack: Remove kernel text addresses from stack dump")

Fix it by updating the per-line absolute address check to also check for
function-based address lines like the following:

  write_sysrq_trigger+0x51/0x60

I didn't remove the check for absolute addresses because it's still
needed for ARM.
