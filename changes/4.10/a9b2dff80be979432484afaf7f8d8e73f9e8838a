l2tp: take remote address into account in l2tp_ip and l2tp_ip6 socket lookups

For connected sockets, __l2tp_ip{,6}_bind_lookup() needs to check the
remote IP when looking for a matching socket. Otherwise a connected
socket can receive traffic not originating from its peer.

Drop l2tp_ip_bind_lookup() and l2tp_ip6_bind_lookup() instead of
updating their prototype, as these functions aren't used.
