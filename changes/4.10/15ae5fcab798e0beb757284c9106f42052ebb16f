mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: remove support for sh7372

Remove documentation of support for the SH7372 (SH-Mobile AP4) from the MMC
driver. The driver itself appears to have no SH7372 specific code.

Commit edf4100906044225 ("ARM: shmobile: sh7372 dtsi: Remove Legacy file")
removes this SoC from the kernel in v4.1.
