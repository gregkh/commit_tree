block: don't try Write Same from __blkdev_issue_zeroout

Write Same can return an error asynchronously if it turns out the
underlying SCSI device does not support Write Same, which makes a
proper fallback to other methods in __blkdev_issue_zeroout impossible.
Thus only issue a Write Same from blkdev_issue_zeroout an don't try it
at all from __blkdev_issue_zeroout as a non-invasive workaround.
