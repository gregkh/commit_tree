iio: dht11: Use usleep_range instead of msleep for start signal

The DHT22 (AM2302) datasheet specifies that the LOW start pulse should not
exceed 20ms. However, observations with an oscilloscope of an RPi Model 2B
(rev 1.1) communicating with a DHT22 sensor showed that the driver was
consistently sending start pulses longer than 20ms:

Kernel 4.7.10-v7+ (n=132):
    Minimum pulse length: 20.20ms
    Maximum:              29.84ms
    Mean:                 24.96ms
    StDev:                2.82ms
    Sensor response rate: 100%
    Read success rate:    76%

On kernel 4.8, the start pulse was so long that the sensor would not even
respond 97% of the time:

Kernel 4.8.16-v7+ (n=100):
    Minimum pulse length: 30.4ms
    Maximum:              74.4ms
    Mean:                 39.3ms
    StDev:                10.2ms
    Sensor response rate: 3%
    Read success rate:    3%

The driver would return ETIMEDOUT and write log messages like this:

[   51.430987] dht11 dht11@0: Only 1 signal edges detected
[   66.311019] dht11 dht11@0: Only 0 signal edges detected

Replacing msleep(18) with usleep_range(18000, 20000) made the pulse length
sane again and restored responsiveness:

Kernel 4.8.16-v7+ with usleep_range (n=123):
    Minimum pulse length: 18.16ms
    Maximum:              20.20ms
    Mean:                 19.85ms
    StDev:                0.51ms
    Sensor response rate: 100%
    Read success rate:    84%
