[media] stv090x: use lookup tables for carrier/noise ratio

The stv090x driver uses the lookup table for signal strength already,
with this patch we use the lookup tables for carrier/noise ratio as well.
This has the advantage, that values for DVB-S and DVB-S2 are now
corresponding, while before they were way off. The values are now
proportional to real carrier/noise ratio, while before they were
corresponding to register values. So now applications are able to give
the user real carrier/noise ratio.

Because the output has to be within 0x0000...0xFFFF the three negative
values for DVB-S2 are omitted. This is no significant loss, because
reception is lost at 7.5 dB already (TT S2-1600, Cine S2), so the
negative values are not really important, and also for DVB-S they donÂ´t
exist.
