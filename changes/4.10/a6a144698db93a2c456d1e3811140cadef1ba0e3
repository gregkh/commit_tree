efi/libstub: Add random.c to ARM build

Make random.c build for ARM by moving the fallback definition of
EFI_ALLOC_ALIGN to efistub.h, and replacing a division by a value
we know to be a power of 2 with a right shift (this is required since
ARM does not have any integer division helper routines in its decompressor)
