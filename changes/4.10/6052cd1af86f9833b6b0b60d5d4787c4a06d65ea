be2net: fix unicast list filling

The adapter->pmac_id[0] item is used for primary MAC address but
this is not true for adapter->uc_list[0] as is assumed in
be_set_uc_list(). There are N UC addresses copied first from net_device
to adapter->uc_list[1..N] and then N UC addresses from
adapter->uc_list[0..N-1] are sent to HW. So the last UC address is never
stored into HW and address 00:00:00:00;00:00 (from uc_list[0]) is used
instead.
