scsi: ufshcd: release resources if probe fails

If ufshcd pltfrm/pci driver's probe fails for some reason then ensure
that scsi host is released to avoid memory leak but managed memory
allocations (via devm_* calls) need not to be freed explicitly on probe
failure as memory allocated with these functions is automatically freed
on driver detach.
