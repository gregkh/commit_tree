gtp: fix cross netns recv on gtp socket

The use of the passed through netlink src_net to check for a
cross netns operation was wrong. Using the GTP socket and the
GTP netdevice is always correct (even if the netdev has been
moved to new netns after link creation).

Remove the now obsolete net field from gtp_dev.
