dax: protect PTE modification on WP fault by radix tree entry lock

Currently PTE gets updated in wp_pfn_shared() after dax_pfn_mkwrite()
has released corresponding radix tree entry lock.  When we want to
writeprotect PTE on cache flush, we need PTE modification to happen
under radix tree entry lock to ensure consistent updates of PTE and
radix tree (standard faults use page lock to ensure this consistency).
So move update of PTE bit into dax_pfn_mkwrite().
