mlx4: fix use-after-free in mlx4_en_fold_software_stats()

My recent commit to get more precise rx/tx counters in ndo_get_stats64()
can lead to crashes at device dismantle, as Jesper found out.

We must prevent mlx4_en_fold_software_stats() trying to access
tx/rx rings if they are deleted.

Fix this by adding a test against priv->port_up in
mlx4_en_fold_software_stats()

Calling mlx4_en_fold_software_stats() from mlx4_en_stop_port()
allows us to eventually broadcast the latest/current counters to
rtnetlink monitors.
