x86/mcheck: Be prepared for a rollback back to the ONLINE state

If we try a CPU down and fail in the middle then we roll back to the
online state. This means we would perform CPU_ONLINE / mce_device_create()
without invoking CPU_DEAD / mce_device_remove() for the cleanup of what was
allocated in CPU_ONLINE.

Be prepared for this and don't allocate the struct if we have it
already.
