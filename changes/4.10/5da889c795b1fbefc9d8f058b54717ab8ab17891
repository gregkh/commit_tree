tools/virtio: fix READ_ONCE()

The virtio tools implementation of READ_ONCE() has a single parameter called
'var', but erroneously refers to 'val' for its cast, and thus won't work unless
there's a variable of the correct type that happens to be called 'var'.

Fix this with s/var/val/, making READ_ONCE() work as expected regardless.
