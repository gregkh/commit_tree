Fix missing sanity check in /dev/sg

What happens is that a write to /dev/sg is given a request with non-zero
->iovec_count combined with zero ->dxfer_len.  Or with ->dxferp pointing
to an array full of empty iovecs.

Having write permission to /dev/sg shouldn't be equivalent to the
ability to trigger BUG_ON() while holding spinlocks...

[ The BUG_ON() got changed to a WARN_ON_ONCE(), but this fixes the
  underlying issue.  - Linus ]
