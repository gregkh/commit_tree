net: phy: Cleanup the Edge-Rate feature in Microsemi PHYs.

Edge-Rate cleanup include the following:
- Updated device tree bindings documentation for edge-rate
- The edge-rate is now specified as a "slowdown", meaning that it is now
  being specified as positive values instead of negative (both
  documentation and implementation wise).
- Only explicitly documented values for "vsc8531,vddmac" and
  "vsc8531,edge-slowdown" are accepted by the device driver.
- Deleted include/dt-bindings/net/mscc-phy-vsc8531.h as it was not needed.
- Read/validate devicetree settings in probe instead of init
