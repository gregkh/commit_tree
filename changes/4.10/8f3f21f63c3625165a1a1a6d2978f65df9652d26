drm/i2c: tda998x: only enable audio if supported by sink

Check for audio support by the attached sink by consulting the EDID
prior to enabling audio over the TMDS link.  We must consult the EDID
after calling drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes(), as this can
use an override EDID, or load a replacement EDID.
