drm/i915: Always flush the dirty CPU cache when pinning the scanout

Currently we only clflush the scanout if it is in the CPU domain. Also
flush if we have a pending CPU clflush. We also want to treat the
dirtyfb path similar, and flush any pending writes there as well.

v2: Only send the fb flush message if flushing the dirt on flip
v3: Make flush-for-flip and dirtyfb look more alike since they serve
similar roles as end-of-frame marker.
