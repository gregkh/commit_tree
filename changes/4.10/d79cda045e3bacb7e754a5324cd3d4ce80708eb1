usbip: fix possibility of dereference by NULLL pointer in vhci_hcd.c

This patch fixes possibility of dereference by NULLL pointer in "[PATCH
v5 1/3] usbip: vhci extension: modifications to vhci driver" which has
been merged to 4.9-rc1. It occurs when a URB with pointer to invalid
USB/IP device is enqueued in race condition against detach operation.

A pointer was passed to vdev_to_vhci() before NULL check.
In vdev_to_vhci(), there's a dereference by the pointer.

This patch moves vdev_to_vhci() after NULL check of the pointer.
