mm: add follow_pte_pmd()

Patch series "Write protect DAX PMDs in *sync path".

Currently dax_mapping_entry_mkclean() fails to clean and write protect
the pmd_t of a DAX PMD entry during an *sync operation.  This can result
in data loss, as detailed in patch 2.

This series is based on Dan's "libnvdimm-pending" branch, which is the
current home for Jan's "dax: Page invalidation fixes" series.  You can
find a working tree here:

This patch (of 2):

Similar to follow_pte(), follow_pte_pmd() allows either a PTE leaf or a
huge page PMD leaf to be found and returned.
