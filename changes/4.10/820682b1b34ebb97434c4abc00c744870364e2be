scsi: ncr5380: Store IO ports and addresses in host private data

The various 5380 drivers inconsistently store register pointers
either in the Scsi_Host struct "legacy crap" area or in special,
board-specific members of the NCR5380_hostdata struct. Uniform
use of the latter struct makes for simpler and faster code (see
the following patches) and helps to reduce use of the
NCR5380_implementation_fields macro.
