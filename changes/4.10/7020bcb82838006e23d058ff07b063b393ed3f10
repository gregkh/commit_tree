ACPI: do not warn if _BQC does not exist

Starting from ACPI spec 3.0, it's only clarified that _BCM control
method is required if _BCL is implemented. There is no word
saying _BQC is required.

And in ACPI spec 6.1 B.5.4, for _BQC, it is explicitly stated that
"This optional method returns the current brightness level of a
built-in display output device. If present, it must be set by
the platform for initial brightness."

Thus remove the obsolete warning message.
