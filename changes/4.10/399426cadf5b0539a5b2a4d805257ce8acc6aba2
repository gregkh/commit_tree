[media] cx88: make checkpatch.pl happy

Usually, I don't like fixing coding style issues on non-staging
drivers, as it could be a mess pretty easy, and could become like
a snow ball. That's the case of recent changes on two changesets:
they disalign some statements. Yet, a care a lot with cx88 driver,
as it was the first driver I touched at the Kernel, and I've been
maintaining it since 2005. So, several of the coding style issues
were due to my code.

Per Andrey's suggestion, I ran checkpatch.pl in strict mode, with
fixed several other issues, did some function alinments, but broke
other alinments.

So, I had to manually apply another round of manual fixes to make
sure that everything is ok, and to make checkpatch happy with
this patch.

With this patch, checkpatch.pl is now happy when called with:
	./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f --max-line-length=998 --ignore PREFER_PR_LEVEL

Also, the 80-cols violations that made sense were fixed.

Checkpatch would be happier if we convert it to use dev_foo(),
but this is a more complex change.

NOTE: there are some places with msleep(1). As this driver was
written at the time that the default was to sleep at least 10ms
on such calls (e. g. CONFIG_HZ=100), I replaced those calls by
usleep_range(10000, 20000), with should be safe to avoid breakages.
