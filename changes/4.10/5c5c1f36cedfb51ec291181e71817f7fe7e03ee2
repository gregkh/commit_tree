kasan: support panic_on_warn

If user sets panic_on_warn, he wants kernel to panic if there is
anything barely wrong with the kernel.  KASAN-detected errors are
definitely not less benign than an arbitrary kernel WARNING.

Panic after KASAN errors if panic_on_warn is set.

We use this for continuous fuzzing where we want kernel to stop and
reboot on any error.
