IB/mlx5: Add support for CQE compressing

CQE compressing reduces PCI overhead by coalescing and compressing
multiple CQEs into a single merged CQE. Successful compressing
improves message rate especially for small packet traffic.

CQE compressing is supported for all 64B CQE formats (with certain
limitations) generated by RQ/Responder or by SQ/Requestor.
