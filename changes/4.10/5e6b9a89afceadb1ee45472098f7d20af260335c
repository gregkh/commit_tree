arm64: tegra: Add VDD_GPU regulator to Jetson TX1

Add the VDD_GPU regulator (a GPIO-enabled PWM regulator) to the Jetson
TX1 board. This addition allows the GPU to be used provided the
bootloader properly enabled the GPU node.

[as pointed out by Thierry on IRC, nobody has reported a bug
 in the field, but using a new bootloader with a .dtb that
 has the incorrect data, it will crash on boot]
