arm64: percpu: kill off final ACCESS_ONCE() uses

For several reasons it is preferable to use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() rather than
ACCESS_ONCE(). For example, these handle aggregate types, result in shorter
source code, and better document the intended access (which may be useful for
instrumentation features such as the upcoming KTSAN).

Over a number of patches, most uses of ACCESS_ONCE() in arch/arm64 have been
migrated to {READ,WRITE}_ONCE(). For consistency, and the above reasons, this
patch migrates the final remaining uses.
