tty: vt, cleanup and document con_scroll

Scrolling helpers scrup and scrdown both accept 'top' and 'bottom' as
unsigned int. Number of lines 'nr' is accepted as int, but all callers
pass down unsigned too. So change the type of 'nr' to unsigned too.
Now, promote unsigned int from the helpers up to the con_scroll
hook which actually accepted all those as signed int.

Next, the 'dir' parameter can have only two values and we define
constants for that: SM_UP and SM_DOWN. Switch them to enum and do
proper type checking on 'dir' too.

Finally, document the behaviour of the hook.
