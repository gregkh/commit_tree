tcp: fix mark propagation with fwmark_reflect enabled

Otherwise, RST packets generated by the TCP stack for non-existing
sockets always have mark 0.
The mark from the original packet is assigned to the netns_ipv4/6
socket used to send the response so that it can get copied into the
response skb when the socket sends it.
