mm/vmalloc.c: simplify /proc/vmallocinfo implementation

Many seq_file helpers exist for simplifying implementation of virtual
files especially, for /proc nodes.  however, the helpers for iteration
over list_head are available but aren't adopted to implement
/proc/vmallocinfo currently.

Simplify /proc/vmallocinfo implementation by using existing seq_file
helpers.
