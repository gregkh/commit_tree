ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add support for A31 playback through headphone output

The A31 has a similar codec to the A10/A20. The PCM parts are very
similar, with different register offsets. The analog paths are very
different. There are more inputs and outputs. The ADC mux has been
replaced with a proper mixer.

This patch adds support for the basic playback path of the A31 codec,
from the DAC to the headphones. Headphone detection, microphone,
signaling, other inputs/outputs and capture will be added later.
