spi: Add Flag to Enable Slave Select with GPIO Chip Select.

Some SPI masters require slave selection before the transfer
can begin [1]. The SPI framework currently selects the chip using
either 1) the internal CS mechanism or 2) the GPIO CS, but not both.

This patch adds a new master->flags define to indicate both the GPIO
CS and the internal chip select mechanism should be used.

Tested On:
    Altera CycloneV development kit
    Compile tested for build errors on x86_64 (allyesconfigs)
