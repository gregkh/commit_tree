audit: handle a clean auditd shutdown with grace

When auditd stops cleanly it sets 'auditd_pid' to 0 with an
AUDIT_SET message, in this case we should reset our backlog
queues via the auditd_reset() function.  This patch also adds
a 'auditd_pid' check to the top of kauditd_send_unicast_skb()
so we can fail quicker.
