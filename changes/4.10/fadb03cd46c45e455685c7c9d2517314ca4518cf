reset: zynq: make it explicitly non-modular

The Makefile/Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/reset/Kconfig:config RESET_ZYNQ
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  bool "ZYNQ Reset Driver" if COMPILE_TEST
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  default ARCH_ZYNQ

or

drivers/reset/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_ARCH_ZYNQ) += reset-zynq.o
arch/arm/mach-zynq/Kconfig:config ARCH_ZYNQ
arch/arm/mach-zynq/Kconfig:     bool "Xilinx Zynq ARM Cortex A9 Platform" if ARCH_MULTI_V7

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the few remaining traces of modular macro usage, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
