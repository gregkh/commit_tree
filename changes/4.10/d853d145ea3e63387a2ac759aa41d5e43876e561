net: phy: add an option to disable EEE advertisement

This patch adds an option to disable EEE advertisement in the generic PHY
by providing a mask of prohibited modes corresponding to the value found in
the MDIO_AN_EEE_ADV register.

On some platforms, PHY Low power idle seems to be causing issues, even
breaking the link some cases. The patch provides a convenient way for these
platforms to disable EEE advertisement and work around the issue.
