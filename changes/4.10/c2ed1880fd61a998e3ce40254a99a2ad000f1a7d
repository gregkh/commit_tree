net: ipv6: check route protocol when deleting routes

The protocol field is checked when deleting IPv4 routes, but ignored for
IPv6, which causes problems with routing daemons accidentally deleting
externally set routes (observed by multiple bird6 users).

This can be verified using `ip -6 route del <prefix> proto something`.
