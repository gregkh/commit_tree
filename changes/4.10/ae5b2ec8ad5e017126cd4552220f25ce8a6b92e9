block: set REQ_SYNC if we clear REQ_FUA|REQ_PREFLUSH

If we insert a flush request, we clear REQ_PREFLUSH and/or REQ_FUA,
depending on flush settings. Since op_is_sync() factors those flags
in for deciding whether this request is sync or not, we should
set REQ_SYNC to avoid screwing up this accounting.

This should be less fragile.
