Btrfs: fix file extent corruption

In order to do hole punching we have a block reserve to hold the reservation we
need to drop the extents in our range.  Since we could end up dropping a lot of
extents we set rsv->failfast so we can just loop around again and drop the
remaining of the range.  Unfortunately we unconditionally fill the hole extents
in and start from the last extent we encountered, which we may or may not have
dropped.  So this can result in overlapping file extent entries, which can be
tripped over in a variety of ways, either by hitting BUG_ON(!ret) in
fill_holes() after the search, or in btrfs_set_item_key_safe() in
btrfs_drop_extent() at a later time by an unrelated task.  Fix this by only
setting drop_end to the last extent we did actually drop.  This way our holes
are filled in properly for the range that we did drop, and the rest of the range
that remains to be dropped is actually dropped.  Thanks,
