ARM: socfpga: fpga bridge driver support

Supports Altera SOCFPGA bridges:
 * fpga2sdram
 * fpga2hps
 * hps2fpga
 * lwhps2fpga

Allows enabling/disabling the bridges through the FPGA
Bridge Framework API functions.

The fpga2sdram driver only supports enabling and disabling
of the ports that been configured early on.  This is due to
a hardware limitation where the read, write, and command
ports on the fpga2sdram bridge can only be reconfigured
while there are no transactions to the sdram, i.e. when
running out of OCRAM before the kernel boots.

Device tree property 'init-val' configures the driver to
enable or disable the bridge during probe.  If the property
does not exist, the driver will leave the bridge in its
current state.
