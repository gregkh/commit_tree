[media] cx88: make checkpatch happier

This driver is old, and have lots of checkpatch violations.
As we're touching a lot on this driver due to the printk
conversions, let's run checkpatch --fix on it, in order to
solve some of those issues.

Also, do a few manual adjustments:
- remove the FSF address and use the usual coding style
  for the initial comments;
- use WARN_ON() instead of BUG_ON();
- remove an unused typedef;
- break a few long lines.
