drm/i915: Remove superfluous locking around userfault_list

Now that we have reduced the access to the list to either (a) under the
struct_mutex whilst holding the RPM wakeref (so that concurrent writers to
the list are serialised by struct_mutex) and (b) under the atomic
runtime suspend (which cannot run concurrently with any other accessor due
to the atomic nature of the runtime suspend) we can remove the extra
locking around the list itself.
