net/mlx5e: TC ipv4 tunnel encap offload error flow fixes

When the route lookup fails we should return the actual error.

When the neigh isn't valid, we should return -EOPNOTSUPP as done
in similar cases along the code.

When the offload can't take place as of invalid neigh etc, we
must release the neigh.
