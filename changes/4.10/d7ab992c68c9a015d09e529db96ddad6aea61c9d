drm/i915: fix the dequeue logic for single_port_submission context

For a single_port_submission context, GVT expects that it can only be
submitted to port 0, and there shouldn't be any other context in port 1
at the same time. This is required by GVT-g context to have an opportunity
to save/restore some non-hw context render registers.

This patch is to workaround GVT-g.

v2: optimized code by following Chris's advice, and added more comments to
explain the patch.
v3: followed the coding style.
