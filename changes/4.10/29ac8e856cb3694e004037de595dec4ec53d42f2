ocfs2: implement the VFS clone_range, copy_range, and dedupe_range features

Connect the new VFS clone_range, copy_range, and dedupe_range features
to the existing reflink capability of ocfs2.  Compared to the existing
ocfs2 reflink ioctl We have to do things a little differently to support
the VFS semantics (we can clone subranges of a file but we don't clone
xattrs), but the VFS ioctls are more broadly supported.

v2: Convert inline data files to extents files before reflinking,
and fix i_blocks so that stat(2) output is correct.
v3: Make zero-length dedupe consistent with btrfs behavior.
v4: Use VFS double-inode lock routines and remove MAX_DEDUPE_LEN.
