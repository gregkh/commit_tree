powerpc/mm: Dump hash table

Useful to be able to dump the kernel hash page table to check
which pages are hashed along with their sizes and other details.

Add a debugfs file to check the hash page table. If radix is enabled
(and so there is no hash page table) then this file doesn't exist. To
use this the PPC_PTDUMP config option must be selected.
