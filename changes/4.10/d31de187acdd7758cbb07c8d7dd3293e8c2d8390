crypto: testmgr - add/enhance test cases for CRC-T10DIF

The existing test cases only exercise a small slice of the various
possible code paths through the x86 SSE/PCLMULQDQ implementation,
and the upcoming ports of it for arm64. So add one that exceeds 256
bytes in size, and convert another to a chunked test.
