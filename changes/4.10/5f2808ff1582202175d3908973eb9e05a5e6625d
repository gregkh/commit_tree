sd: fix uninitialized variable access in error handling

If sd_zbc_report_zones fails, the check for 'zone_blocks == 0'
later in the function accesses uninitialized data:

drivers/scsi/sd_zbc.c: In function ‘sd_zbc_read_zones’:
drivers/scsi/sd_zbc.c:520:7: error: ‘zone_blocks’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This sets it to zero, which has the desired effect of leaving
the sd_zbc_read_zones successfully with sdkp->zone_blocks = 0.
