Btrfs: fix BUG_ON in btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty

This can only happen with CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY=y.

Commit 1ba98d0 ("Btrfs: detect corruption when non-root leaf has zero item")
assumes that a leaf is its root when leaf->bytenr == btrfs_root_bytenr(root),
however, we should not use btrfs_root_bytenr(root) since it's mainly got
updated during committing transaction.  So the check can fail when doing
COW on this leaf while it is a root.

This changes to use "if (leaf == btrfs_root_node(root))" instead, just like
how we check whether leaf is a root in __btrfs_cow_block().
