ipc/sem: do not call wake_sem_queue_do() prematurely ... as this call should obviously be paired with its _prepare()

counterpart.  At least whenever possible, as there is no harm in calling
it bogusly as we do now in a few places.  Immediate error semop(2) paths
that are far from ever having the task block can be simplified and avoid
a few unnecessary loads on their way out of the call as it is not deeply
nested.
