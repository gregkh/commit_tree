sfc: remove Software TSO

It gives no advantage over GSO now that xmit_more exists.  If we find
 ourselves unable to handle a TSO skb (because our TXQ doesn't have a
 TSOv2 context and the NIC doesn't support TSOv1), hand it back to GSO.
 Also do that if the TSO handler fails with EINVAL for any other reason.
As Falcon-architecture NICs don't support any firmware-assisted TSO,
 they no longer advertise TSO feature flags at all.
