ACPI / gpio: Add hogging support

GPIO hogging means that the GPIO controller can "hog" and configure certain
GPIOs without need for a driver or userspace to do that. This is useful in
open-connected boards where BIOS cannot possibly know beforehand which
devices will be connected to the board.

This adds GPIO hogging mechanism to ACPI analogous to Device Tree.
