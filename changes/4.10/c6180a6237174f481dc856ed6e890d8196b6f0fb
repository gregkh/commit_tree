NFSv4: Fix client recovery when server reboots multiple times

If the server reboots multiple times, the client should rely on the
server to tell it that it cannot reclaim state as per section 9.6.3.4
in RFC7530 and section 8.4.2.1 in RFC5661.
Currently, the client is being to conservative, and is assuming that
if the server reboots while state recovery is in progress, then it must
ignore state that was not recovered before the reboot.
