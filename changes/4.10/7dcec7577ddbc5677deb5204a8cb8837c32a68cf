dmaengine: qcom_hidma: prevent disable in error

When an error is observed, we try to disable the channel and prevent
further accesses from the client.

Depending on the type of error, transitioning into disabled state might
not be possible. Adding a check to make sure that HW is in enabled/running
state before the disable transition happens.
