sd_zbc: Force use of READ16/WRITE16

Normally, sd_read_capacity sets sdp->use_16_for_rw to 1 based on the
disk capacity so that READ16/WRITE16 are used for large drives.
However, for a zoned disk with RC_BASIS set to 0, the capacity reported
through READ_CAPACITY may be very small, leading to use_16_for_rw not being
set and READ10/WRITE10 commands being used, even after the actual zoned disk
capacity is corrected in sd_zbc_read_zones. This causes LBA offset overflow for
accesses beyond 2TB.

As the ZBC standard makes it mandatory for ZBC drives to support
the READ16/WRITE16 commands anyway, make sure that use_16_for_rw is set.
