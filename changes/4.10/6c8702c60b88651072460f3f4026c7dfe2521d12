ipv6: sr: add support for SRH encapsulation and injection with lwtunnels

This patch creates a new type of interfaceless lightweight tunnel (SEG6),
enabling the encapsulation and injection of SRH within locally emitted
packets and forwarded packets.

>From a configuration viewpoint, a seg6 tunnel would be configured as follows:

  ip -6 ro ad fc00::1/128 encap seg6 mode encap segs fc42::1,fc42::2,fc42::3 dev eth0

Any packet whose destination address is fc00::1 would thus be encapsulated
within an outer IPv6 header containing the SRH with three segments, and would
actually be routed to the first segment of the list. If `mode inline' was
specified instead of `mode encap', then the SRH would be directly inserted
after the IPv6 header without outer encapsulation.

The inline mode is only available if CONFIG_IPV6_SEG6_INLINE is enabled. This
feature was made configurable because direct header insertion may break
several mechanisms such as PMTUD or IPSec AH.
