scsi: qla2xxx: Add Block Multi Queue functionality.

Tell the SCSI layer how many hardware queues we have based on the number
of max queue pairs created. The number of max queue pairs created will
depend on number of MSI-X vector count.

This feature can be turned on via CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT or passing
scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=Y as a parameter to the kernel
