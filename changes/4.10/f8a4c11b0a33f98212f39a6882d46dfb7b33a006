drm/amd/powerplay: mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../powerplay/smumgr/fiji_smumgr.c:162:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'fiji_setup_pwr_virus' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
So this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
