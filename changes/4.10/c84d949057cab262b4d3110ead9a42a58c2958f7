udp: copy skb->truesize in the first cache line

In UDP RX handler, we currently clear skb->dev before skb
is added to receive queue, because device pointer is no longer
available once we exit from RCU section.

Since this first cache line is always hot, lets reuse this space
to store skb->truesize and thus avoid a cache line miss at
udp_recvmsg()/udp_skb_destructor time while receive queue
spinlock is held.
