i40e: fix confusing dmesg info for ethtool -L option

Ethtool -L option with the combined parameter is for changing the number of
multi-purpose channels of the specified network device. The pre-set maximum
for the combined channels is cpu dependent. Currently, for an i40e device,
when the user sets a value between 64 and the maximum that the cpu can
support for the combined parameter, the i40e driver displays the confusing
info in dmesg to only show 64 as the RSS count regardless of what the
accepted user input is as long as it is larger than 64.

This patch fixes the message in the i40e driver when the user uses
ethtool -L to change the number of the combined channels to consistently
display the user requested value if it is valid and accepted by ethtool.
