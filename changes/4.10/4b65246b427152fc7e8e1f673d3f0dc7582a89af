ethtool: Protect {get, set}_phy_tunable with PHY device mutex

PHY drivers should be able to rely on the caller of {get,set}_tunable to
have acquired the PHY device mutex, in order to both serialize against
concurrent calls of these functions, but also against PHY state machine
changes. All ethtool PHY-level functions do this, except
{get,set}_tunable, so we make them consistent here as well.

We need to update the Microsemi PHY driver in the same commit to avoid
introducing either deadlocks, or lack of proper locking.

Fixes: 968ad9da7e0e ("ethtool: Implements ETHTOOL_PHY_GTUNABLE/ETHTOOL_PHY_STUNABLE")
Fixes: 310d9ad57ae0 ("net: phy: Add downshift get/set support in Microsemi PHYs driver")
