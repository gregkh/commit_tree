dmaengine: cppi41: Fix oops in cppi41_runtime_resume

Commit fdea2d09b997 ("dmaengine: cppi41: Add basic PM runtime support")
together with recent MUSB changes allowed USB and DMA on BeagleBone to idle
when no cable is connected. But looks like few corner case issues still
remain.

Looks like just by re-plugging USB cable about ten or so times on BeagleBone
when configured in USB peripheral mode we can get warnings and eventually
trigger an oops in cppi41 DMA:

This is because of a race with runtime PM and cppi41_dma_issue_pending()
as reported by Alexandre Bailon <abailon@baylibre.com> in earlier
set of patches. Based on mailing list discussions we however came to the
conclusion that a different fix from Alexandre's fix is needed in order
to guarantee that DMA is really active when we try to use it.

To fix the issue, we need to add a driver specific flag as we otherwise
can have -EINPROGRESS state set by runtime PM and can't rely on
pm_runtime_active() to tell us when we can use the DMA.

And we need to make sure the DMA transfers get triggered in the queued
order. So let's always queue the transfers, then flush the queue
from both cppi41_dma_issue_pending() and cppi41_runtime_resume()
as suggested by Grygorii Strashko <grygorii.strashko@ti.com> in an
earlier example patch.

For reference, this is also documented in Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt
in the example at the end of the file as pointed out by Grygorii Strashko
<grygorii.strashko@ti.com>.

Based on earlier patches from Alexandre Bailon <abailon@baylibre.com>
and Grygorii Strashko <grygorii.strashko@ti.com> modified based on
testing and what was discussed on the mailing lists.
