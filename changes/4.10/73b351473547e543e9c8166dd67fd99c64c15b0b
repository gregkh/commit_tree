cgroup: move CONFIG_SOCK_CGROUP_DATA to init/Kconfig

We now 'select SOCK_CGROUP_DATA' but Kconfig complains that this is
not right when CONFIG_NET is disabled and there is no socket interface:

warning: (CGROUP_BPF) selects SOCK_CGROUP_DATA which has unmet direct dependencies (NET)

I don't know what the correct solution for this is, but simply removing
the dependency on NET from SOCK_CGROUP_DATA by moving it out of the
'if NET' section avoids the warning and does not produce other build
errors.
