drm/i915: Add assert for no pending GPU requests during suspend/resume in LR mode

During resume we will reset the SW/HW tracking for each ring head/tail
pointers and so are not prepared to replay any pending requests (as
opposed to GPU reset time). Add an assert for this both to the suspend
and the resume code.

v2:
- Check for ELSP port idle already during suspend and check !gt.awake
  during resume. (Chris)
v3:
- Move the !gt.awake check to i915_gem_resume().
v4:
- s/intel_lr_engines_idle/intel_execlists_idle/ (Chris)
