lightnvm: manage lun partitions internally in mm

LUNs are exclusively owned by targets implementing a block device FTL.
Doing this reservation requires at the moment a 2-way callback gennvm
<-> target. The reason behind this is that LUNs were not assumed to
always be exclusively owned by targets. However, this design decision
goes against I/O determinism QoS (two targets would mix I/O on the same
parallel unit in the device).

This patch makes LUN reservation as part of the target creation on the
media manager. This makes that LUNs are always exclusively owned by the
target instantiated on top of them. LUN stripping and/or sharing should
be implemented on the target itself or the layers on top.
