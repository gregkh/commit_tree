PM / Runtime: Remove the exported function pm_children_suspended()

The exported function pm_children_suspended() has only one caller, which is
the runtime PM internal function, rpm_check_suspend_allowed().

Let's clean-up this code, by removing pm_children_suspended() altogether
and instead do the one-liner check directly in rpm_check_suspend_allowed().
