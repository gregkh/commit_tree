batman-adv: Use proper name for fragments list head

The batman-adv codebase is using "list" for the list node (prev/next) and
<list content descriptor>+"_list" for the head of a list. Not using this
naming scheme can up in confusions because list_head is used for both the
head of the list and the list node (prev/next) in each item of the list.
