sched/core: Fix find_idlest_group() for fork

During fork, the utilization of a task is init once the rq has been
selected because the current utilization level of the rq is used to
set the utilization of the fork task. As the task's utilization is
still 0 at this step of the fork sequence, it doesn't make sense to
look for some spare capacity that can fit the task's utilization.
Furthermore, I can see perf regressions for the test:

   hackbench -P -g 1

because the least loaded policy is always bypassed and tasks are not
spread during fork.

With this patch and the fix below, we are back to same performances as
for v4.8. The fix below is only a temporary one used for the test
until a smarter solution is found because we can't simply remove the
test which is useful for others benchmarks
