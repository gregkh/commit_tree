target: Use correct SCSI status during EXTENDED_COPY exception

This patch adds the missing target_complete_cmd() SCSI status
parameter change in target_xcopy_do_work(), that was originally
missing in commit 926317de33.

It correctly propigates up the correct SCSI status during
EXTENDED_COPY exception cases, instead of always using the
hardcoded SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION from original code.

This is required for ESX host environments that expect to
hit SAM_STAT_RESERVATION_CONFLICT for certain scenarios,
and SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION results in non-retriable
status for these cases.
