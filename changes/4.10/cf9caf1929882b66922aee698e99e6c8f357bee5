staging: vc04_services: Replace dmac_map_area with dmac_map_sg

The original arm implementation uses dmac_map_area which is not
portable.  Replace it with an architecture neutral version
which uses dma_map_sg.

As you can see that for larger page sizes, the dma_map_sg
implementation is faster then the original unportable dma_map_area
implementation.

For message sizes >= 64KB, dma_map_sg is faster then dma_map_page.

For message size >= 256KB, the dma_map_sg is the fastest
implementation.

"Normal" messages sizes should be about 1MB which is beyond
the length that this change shows a speed increase.

This is v2 of the patch which includes extra WARN_ONs and
incorporates feedback from Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>.
