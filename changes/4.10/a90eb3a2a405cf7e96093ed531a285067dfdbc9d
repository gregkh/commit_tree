radix-tree: fix replacement for multiorder entries

When replacing an entry with NULL, we need to delete any sibling
entries.  Also account deleting exceptional entries properly.  Also fix
a bug with radix_tree_iter_replace() where we would fail to remove
entirely freed nodes.  Also fix accounting bug when switching between
normal and exceptional entries with replace_slot.  Also add testcases
for all these bugs.
