sd: Implement support for ZBC devices

Implement ZBC support functions to setup zoned disks, both
host-managed and host-aware models. Only zoned disks that satisfy
the following conditions are supported:
1) All zones are the same size, with the exception of an eventual
   last smaller runt zone.
2) For host-managed disks, reads are unrestricted (reads are not
   failed due to zone or write pointer alignement constraints).
Zoned disks that do not satisfy these 2 conditions are setup with
a capacity of 0 to prevent their use.

The function sd_zbc_read_zones, called from sd_revalidate_disk,
checks that the device satisfies the above two constraints. This
function may also change the disk capacity previously set by
sd_read_capacity for devices reporting only the capacity of
conventional zones at the beginning of the LBA range (i.e. devices
reporting rc_basis set to 0).

The capacity message output was moved out of sd_read_capacity into
a new function sd_print_capacity to include this eventual capacity
change by sd_zbc_read_zones. This new function also includes a call
to sd_zbc_print_zones to display the number of zones and zone size
of the device.

[Damien: * Removed zone cache support
         * Removed mapping of discard to reset write pointer command
         * Modified sd_zbc_read_zones to include checks that the
           device satisfies the kernel constraints
         * Implemeted REPORT ZONES setup and post-processing based
           on code from Shaun Tancheff <shaun.tancheff@seagate.com>
         * Removed confusing use of 512B sector units in functions
