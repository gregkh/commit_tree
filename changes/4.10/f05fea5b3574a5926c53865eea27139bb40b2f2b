powerpc/eeh: Fix wrong flag passed to eeh_unfreeze_pe()

In __eeh_clear_pe_frozen_state(), we should pass the flag's value
instead of its address to eeh_unfreeze_pe(). The isolated flag is
cleared if no error returned from __eeh_clear_pe_frozen_state(). We
never observed the error from the function. So the isolated flag should
have been always cleared, no real issue is caused because of the misused
@flag.

This fixes the code by passing the value of @flag to eeh_unfreeze_pe().
