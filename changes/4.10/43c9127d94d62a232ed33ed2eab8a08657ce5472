powerpc: Add option to use thin archives

Add an option to use thin archives to build the kernel.
Thin archives are explained in commit a5967db9af51 ("kbuild: allow
architectures to use thin archives instead of ld -r").

This is a gradual way to introduce the option to testers.

Some change to the way we invoke ar is required so it can be used
by scripts/link-vmlinux.sh.
