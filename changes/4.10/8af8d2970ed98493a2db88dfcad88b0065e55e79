IB/hfi1: Optimize pio_buf and send_context structs

Both pio_buf and send_context structs have oversized
fields and have cachelines that can be optimized.

Reduce oversized fields for both structs.
Make sure pio_buf struct fits within a cacheline.
Move read-only fields to their own cacheline in
send_context struct.

All of this will avoid cacheline trading as the ring
progresses and pio buffers/send contexts are used.
