x86/CPU/AMD: Fix Zen SMT topology

After:

  a33d331761bc ("x86/CPU/AMD: Fix Bulldozer topology")

our  SMT scheduling topology for Fam17h systems is broken, because
the ThreadId is included in the ApicId when SMT is enabled.

So, without further decoding cpu_core_id is unique for each thread
rather than the same for threads on the same core. This didn't affect
systems with SMT disabled. Make cpu_core_id be what it is defined to be.
