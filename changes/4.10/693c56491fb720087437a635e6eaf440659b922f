tipc: don't send FIN message from connectionless socket

In commit 6f00089c7372 ("tipc: remove SS_DISCONNECTING state") the
check for socket type is in the wrong place, causing a closing socket
to always send out a FIN message even when the socket was never
connected. This is normally harmless, since the destination node for
such messages most often is zero, and the message will be dropped, but
it is still a wrong and confusing behavior.

We fix this in this commit.
