arm: dts: qcom: apq8064-ifc6410: Add HDMI support

Add HDMI support on IFC6410. Populate the regulators required by HDMI-TX
and PHY. Establish the link between the MDP4 DTV encoder and HDMI. Create
a generic micro HDMI connector DT node. The msm drm driver doesn't parse
for HDMI connectors in DT, but it will do so later.
