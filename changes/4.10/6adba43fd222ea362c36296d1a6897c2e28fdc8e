Input: synaptics-rmi4 - add support for F55 sensor tuning

Sensor tuning support is needed to determine the number of enabled
tx and rx electrodes for use in F54 functions.

The number of enabled electrodes is not identical to the total number
of electrodes as reported with F55:Query0 and F55:Query1. It has to be
calculated by analyzing F55:Ctrl1 (sensor receiver assignment) and
F55:Ctrl2 (sensor transmitter assignment).

Support for additional sensor tuning functions may be added later.
