xen-netfront: Delete rx_refill_timer in xennet_disconnect_backend()

rx_refill_timer should be deleted as soon as we disconnect from the
backend since otherwise it is possible for the timer to go off before
we get to xennet_destroy_queues(). If this happens we may dereference
queue->rx.sring which is set to NULL in xennet_disconnect_backend().
