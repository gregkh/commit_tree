perf jit: Enable jitdump support without dwarf

This patch modifies the build dependencies on the jitdump support in
perf. As it stands jitdump was wrongfully made dependent 100% on using
DWARF. However, the dwarf dependency, only exist if generating the
source line table in genelf_debug.c. The rest of the support does not
need DWARF.

This patch removes the dependency on DWARF for the entire jitdump
support. It keeps it only for the genelf_debug.c support.

[ Make it build only if NO_LIBELF isn't defined, as jitdump.o will only be built in that case ]
