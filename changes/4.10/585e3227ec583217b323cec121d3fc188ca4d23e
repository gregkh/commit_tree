[media] dib3000mb: use pr_foo() instead of printk()

The dprintk() macro relies on continuation lines. This is not
a good practice and will break after commit 563873318d32
("Merge branch 'printk-cleanups'").

So, instead of directly calling printk(), use pr_foo() macros,
adding a \n leading char on each macro call.

The frontend settings also rely on continuation lines. Change
it to avoid the need of adding pr_cont() calls.
