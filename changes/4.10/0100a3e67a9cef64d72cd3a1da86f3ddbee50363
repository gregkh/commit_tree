efi/x86: Prune invalid memory map entries and fix boot regression

Some machines, such as the Lenovo ThinkPad W541 with firmware GNET80WW
(2.28), include memory map entries with phys_addr=0x0 and num_pages=0.

These machines fail to boot after the following commit,

  commit 8e80632fb23f ("efi/esrt: Use efi_mem_reserve() and avoid a kmalloc()")

Fix this by removing such bogus entries from the memory map.

Furthermore, currently the log output for this case (with efi=debug)
looks like:

 [    0.000000] efi: mem45: [Reserved           |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ] range=[0x0000000000000000-0xffffffffffffffff] (0MB)

This is clearly wrong, and also not as informative as it could be.  This
patch changes it so that if we find obviously invalid memory map
entries, we print an error and skip those entries.  It also detects the
display of the address range calculation overflow, so the new output is:

 [    0.000000] efi: [Firmware Bug]: Invalid EFI memory map entries:
 [    0.000000] efi: mem45: [Reserved           |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |  |  |  |  ] range=[0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000000] (invalid)

It also detects memory map sizes that would overflow the physical
address, for example phys_addr=0xfffffffffffff000 and
num_pages=0x0200000000000001, and prints:

 [    0.000000] efi: [Firmware Bug]: Invalid EFI memory map entries:
 [    0.000000] efi: mem45: [Reserved           |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |  |  |  |  ] range=[phys_addr=0xfffffffffffff000-0x20ffffffffffffffff] (invalid)

It then removes these entries from the memory map.
