sh_eth: fix EESIPR values for SH77{34|63}

As the SH77{34|63} manuals are freely available,  I've checked the EESIPR
values written against the manuals, and they appeared to set the reserved
bits 11-15 (which should be 0 on write). Fix those EESIPR values.

Fixes: 380af9e390ec ("net: sh_eth: CPU dependency code collect to "struct sh_eth_cpu_data"")
Fixes: f5d12767c8fd ("sh_eth: get SH77{34|63} support out of #ifdef")
