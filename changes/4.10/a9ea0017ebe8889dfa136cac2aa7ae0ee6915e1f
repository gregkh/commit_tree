arm64: factor out current_stack_pointer

We define current_stack_pointer in <asm/thread_info.h>, though other
files and header relying upon it do not have this necessary include, and
are thus fragile to changes in the header soup.

Subsequent patches will affect the header soup such that directly
including <asm/thread_info.h> may result in a circular header include in
some of these cases, so we can't simply include <asm/thread_info.h>.

Instead, factor current_thread_info into its own header, and have all
existing users include this explicitly.
