drm/tilcdc: Add drm bridge support for attaching drm bridge drivers

Adds drm bride support for attaching drm bridge drivers to tilcdc. The
decision whether a video port leads to an external encoder or bridge
is made simply based on remote device's compatible string. The code
has been tested with BeagleBone-Black with and without BeagleBone
DVI-D Cape Rev A3 using ti-tfp410 driver.
