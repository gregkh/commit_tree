rsi: Host to device command frame vap_capabilites modified with new field vap status

* Command frame vap_capabilites is modified to use for vap add, vap delete
  and vap update in firmware, hence new filed vap status is added.
* When interface is down this frame needs to be send with vap status delete.
  Otherwise it is considered as wrong frame for the same interface in firmware.
* vap_update status is reserved for future.
