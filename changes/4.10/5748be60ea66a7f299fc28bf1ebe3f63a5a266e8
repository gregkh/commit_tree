drm/i915: Standardize port type for DVO encoders

Changing the return type from 'char' to 'enum port' in
intel_dvo_port_name() makes it easier to later move the port information to
intel_encoder. In addition, the port type conforms to what we have
elsewhere.

Removing the last conditional that handles invalid port because dvo_reg is
intialized to valid values for all DVO devices at definition.

v2: Changed return type, for real (Jani)
