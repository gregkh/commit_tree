watchdog: meson: Remove unneeded platform MODULE_ALIAS

The Amlogic Meson is a DT-only platform, which means the devices are
registered via OF and not using the legacy platform devices support.

So there's no need to have a MODULE_ALIAS("platform:meson-gxbb-wdt")
since the reported uevent MODALIAS to user-space will be the OF one.
