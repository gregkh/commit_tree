base: soc: Check for NULL SoC device attributes

If soc_device_match() is used to check the value of a specific
attribute that is not present for the current SoC, the kernel crashes
with a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by explicitly checking for the absence of a needed property,
and considering this a non-match.
