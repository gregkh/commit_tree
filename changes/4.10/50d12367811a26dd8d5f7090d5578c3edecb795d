ASoC: wm9713: Remove unused DAI ID defines

The DAI ID defines are back from the time when DAIs were referenced by a
numerical ID. These days a string is used for matching instead and the
defines are unused. The last user of these defines was removed in commit
f0fba2ad1b6b ("ASoC: multi-component - ASoC Multi-Component Support"). So
remove the defines as well.
