fscrypto: move ioctl processing more fully into common code

Multiple bugs were recently fixed in the "set encryption policy" ioctl.
To make it clear that fscrypt_process_policy() and fscrypt_get_policy()
implement ioctls and therefore their implementations must take standard
security and correctness precautions, rename them to
fscrypt_ioctl_set_policy() and fscrypt_ioctl_get_policy().  Make the
latter take in a struct file * to make it consistent with the former.
