ovl: lookup redirects

If a directory has the "trusted.overlay.redirect" xattr, it means that the
value of the xattr should be used to find the underlying directory on the
next lower layer.

The redirect may be relative or absolute.  Absolute redirects begin with a
slash.

A relative redirect means: instead of the current dentry's name use the
value of the redirect to find the directory in the next lower
layer. Relative redirects must not contain a slash.

An absolute redirect means: look up the directory relative to the root of
the overlay using the value of the redirect in the next lower layer.

Redirects work on lower layers as well.
