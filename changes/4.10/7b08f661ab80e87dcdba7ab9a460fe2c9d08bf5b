bnxt_en: Improve completion ring allocation for VFs.

All available remaining completion rings not used by the PF should be
made available for the VFs so that there are enough rings in the VF to
support RDMA.  The earlier workaround code of capping the rings by the
statistics context is removed.

When SRIOV is disabled, call a new function bnxt_restore_pf_fw_resources()
to restore FW resources.  Later on we need to add some logic to account
for RDMA resources.
