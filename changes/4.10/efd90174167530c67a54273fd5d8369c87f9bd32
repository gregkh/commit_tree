tcp: export sender limits chronographs to TCP_INFO

This patch exports all the sender chronograph measurements collected
in the previous patches to TCP_INFO interface. Note that busy time
exported includes all the other sending limits (rwnd-limited,
sndbuf-limited). Internally the time unit is jiffy but externally
the measurements are in microseconds for future extensions.
