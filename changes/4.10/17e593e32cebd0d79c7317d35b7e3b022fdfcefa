ASoC: topology: ABI - Rename be_dai_elems to dai_elems in manifest

User space uses this field to count physical DAIs, not only BE DAIs since
users may not use DPCM. So we rename this field from be_dai_elems to
dai_elems.

This change is backward compatible, because it does not change the layout
of the struct or data type.
