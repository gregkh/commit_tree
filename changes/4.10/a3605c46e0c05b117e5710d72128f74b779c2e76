cpufreq: acpi-cpufreq: drop rdmsr_on_cpus() usage

The online / pre_down callback is invoked on the target CPU since commit
1cf4f629d9d2 ("cpu/hotplug: Move online calls to hotplugged cpu") which means
for the hotplug callback we can use rmdsrl() instead of rdmsr_on_cpus().

This leaves us with set_boost() as the only user which still needs to
read/write the MSR on different CPUs. There is no point in doing that
update on all cpus with the read modify write magic via per cpu data. We
simply can issue a function call on all online CPUs which also means that we
need half that many IPIs.
