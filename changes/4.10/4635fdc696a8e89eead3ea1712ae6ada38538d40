x86/tsc: Mark Intel ATOM_GOLDMONT TSC reliable

On Intel GOLDMONT Atom SoC TSC is the only available clocksource, so there
is no way to do software calibration or have a watchdog clocksource for it.
Software calibration is already disabled via the TSC_KNOWN_FREQ flag, but
the watchdog requirement still persists, so such systems cannot switch to
high resolution/nohz mode.

Mark it reliable, so it becomes usable. Hardware teams confirmed that this
is safe on that SoC.
