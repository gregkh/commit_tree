Revert "nohz: Fix collision between tick and other hrtimers"

This reverts commit 24b91e360ef521a2808771633d76ebc68bd5604b and commit
7bdb59f1ad47 ("tick/nohz: Fix possible missing clock reprog after tick
soft restart") that depends on it,

Pavel reports that it causes occasional boot hangs for him that seem to
depend on just how the machine was booted.  In particular, his machine
hangs at around the PCI fixups of the EHCI USB host controller, but only
hangs from cold boot, not from a warm boot.

Thomas Gleixner suspecs it's a CPU hotplug interaction, particularly
since Pavel also saw suspend/resume issues that seem to be related.
We're reverting for now while trying to figure out the root cause.
