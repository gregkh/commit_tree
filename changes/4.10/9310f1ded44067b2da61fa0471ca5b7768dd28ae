mailbox: bcm-pdc: PDC driver leaves debugfs files after removal

Minor fix to ensure that debugfs stats pseudo-files are
removed when driver module is unloaded.  Previously, the call to
debugfs_remove_recursive() was never being called since the
directory was not empty, and a seg fault would occur if another
process tried to access these leftover files.
