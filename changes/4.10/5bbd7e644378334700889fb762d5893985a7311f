locking/mutex: Restructure wait loop

Doesn't really matter yet, but pull the HANDOFF and trylock out from
under the wait_lock.

The intention is to add an optimistic spin loop here, which requires
we do not hold the wait_lock, so shuffle code around in preparation.

Also clarify the purpose of taking the wait_lock in the wait loop, its
tempting to want to avoid it altogether, but the cancellation cases
need to to avoid losing wakeups.
