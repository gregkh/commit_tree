mm: move vma_is_anonymous check within pmd_move_must_withdraw

Independent of whether the vma is for anonymous memory, some arches like
ppc64 would like to override pmd_move_must_withdraw().

One option is to encapsulate the vma_is_anonymous() check for general
architectures inside pmd_move_must_withdraw() so that is always called
and architectures that need unconditional overriding can override this
function.  ppc64 needs to override the function when the MMU is
configured to use hash PTE's.
