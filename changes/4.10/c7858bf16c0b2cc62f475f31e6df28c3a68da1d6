asm-prototypes: Clear any CPP defines before declaring the functions

The asm-prototypes.h file is used to provide dummy function declarations
for genksyms, when processing asm files with EXPORT_SYMBOL. Make sure
that any architecture defines get out of our way. x86 currently has an
issue with memcpy on 64bit with CONFIG_KMEMCHECK=y and with
memset/__memset on 32bit:

	$ cat init/test.c
	#include <asm/asm-prototypes.h>
	$ make -s init/test.o

During real build, this manifests itself by genksyms segfaulting.
