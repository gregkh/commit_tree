IB/iser: Fix sg_tablesize calculation

For devices that can register page list that is bigger than
USHRT_MAX, we actually take the wrong value for sg_tablesize.
E.g: for CX4 max_fast_reg_page_list_len is 65536 (bigger than USHRT_MAX)
so we set sg_tablesize to 0 by mistake. Therefore, each IO that is
bigger than 4k splitted to "< 4k" chunks that cause performance degredation.
Remove wrong sg_tablesize assignment, and use the value that was set during
address resolution handler with the needed casting.
