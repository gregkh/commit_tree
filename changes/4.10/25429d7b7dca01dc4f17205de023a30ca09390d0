tcp: allow to turn tcp timestamp randomization off

Eric says: "By looking at tcpdump, and TS val of xmit packets of multiple
flows, we can deduct the relative qdisc delays (think of fq pacing).
This should work even if we have one flow per remote peer."

Having random per flow (or host) offsets doesn't allow that anymore so add
a way to turn this off.
