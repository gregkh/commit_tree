docs: sphinx-extensions: make rstFlatTable work with docutils 0.13

In docutils 0.13, the return type of get_column_widths method of the
Table directive has changed [1], which breaks our flat-table directive
and leads to a TypeError when trying to build the docs [2].

This patch adds support for the new return type, while keeping support
for older docutils versions too.
