mm: add cond_resched() in gather_pte_stats()

The other pagetable walks in task_mmu.c have a cond_resched() after
walking their ptes: add a cond_resched() in gather_pte_stats() too, for
reading /proc/<id>/numa_maps.  Only pagemap_pmd_range() has a
cond_resched() in its (unusually expensive) pmd_trans_huge case: more
should probably be added, but leave them unchanged for now.
