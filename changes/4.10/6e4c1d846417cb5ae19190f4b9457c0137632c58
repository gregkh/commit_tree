s390: char: make con3215 explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/s390/char/Kconfig:config TN3215
drivers/s390/char/Kconfig:      def_bool y

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
