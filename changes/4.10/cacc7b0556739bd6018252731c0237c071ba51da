dm io: use bvec iterator helpers to implement .get_page and .next_page

Firstly we have mature bvec/bio iterator helper for iterate each
page in one bio, not necessary to reinvent a wheel to do that.

Secondly the coming multipage bvecs requires this patch.

Also add comments about the direct access to bvec table.
