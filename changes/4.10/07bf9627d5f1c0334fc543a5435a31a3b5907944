IB/rxe: Wait for tasklets to finish before tearing down QP

The system may crash when a malformed request is received and
the error is detected by the responder.

NodeA: $ ibv_rc_pingpong -g 0 -d rxe0 -i 1 -n 1 -s 50000
NodeB: $ ibv_rc_pingpong -g 0 -d rxe0 -i 1 -n 1 -s 1024 <NodeA_ip>

The responder generates a receive error on node B since the incoming
SEND is oversized. If the client tears down the QP before the responder
or the completer finish running, a page fault may occur.

The fix makes the destroy operation spin until the tasks complete, which
appears to be original intent of the design.
