i40e: Fix bit logic error in failure case

Patch a036244c0686 "i40e: Fix kernel panic on enable/disable LLDP"
introduced an error in bit logic.

Originally this bit manipulation was meant to clear two bits to indicate
that DCB was not enabled or capable. An "&" was incorrectly used instead
of an "|" bit operator to combine the two bitmasks into one.  This also
created a static checker error since the resultant code was a no-op.

This patch fixes the error by using the correct bit-wise operator.
