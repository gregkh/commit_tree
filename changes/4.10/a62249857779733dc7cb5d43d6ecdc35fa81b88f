net/mlx5: Group similer rules under the same fte

When adding a new rule, if we can match it with compare_match_value and
flow tag we might be able to insert the rule to the same fte.
In order to do that, there must be an overlap between the actions of the
fte and the new rule.

When updating the action of an existing fte, we must tell the firmware
we are doing so.
