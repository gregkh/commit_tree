virtio_console: drop unused config fields

struct ports_device includes a config field including the whole
virtio_console_config, but only max_nr_ports in there is ever updated or
used. The rest is unused and in fact does not even mirror the
device config. Drop everything except max_nr_ports,
saving some memory.
