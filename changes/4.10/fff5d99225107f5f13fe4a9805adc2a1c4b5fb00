swiotlb: Add swiotlb=noforce debug option

On architectures like arm64, swiotlb is tied intimately to the core
architecture DMA support. In addition, ZONE_DMA cannot be disabled.

To aid debugging and catch devices not supporting DMA to memory outside
the 32-bit address space, add a kernel command line option
"swiotlb=noforce", which disables the use of bounce buffers.
If specified, trying to map memory that cannot be used with DMA will
fail, and a rate-limited warning will be printed.

Note that io_tlb_nslabs is set to 1, which is the minimal supported
value.
