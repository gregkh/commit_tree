KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Adapt TLB invalidations to work on POWER9

POWER9 adds new capabilities to the tlbie (TLB invalidate entry)
and tlbiel (local tlbie) instructions.  Both instructions get a
set of new parameters (RIC, PRS and R) which appear as bits in the
instruction word.  The tlbiel instruction now has a second register
operand, which contains a PID and/or LPID value if needed, and
should otherwise contain 0.

This adapts KVM-HV's usage of tlbie and tlbiel to work on POWER9
as well as older processors.  Since we only handle HPT guests so
far, we need RIC=0 PRS=0 R=0, which ends up with the same instruction
word as on previous processors, so we don't need to conditionally
execute different instructions depending on the processor.

The local flush on first entry to a guest in book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S
is a loop which depends on the number of TLB sets.  Rather than
using feature sections to set the number of iterations based on
which CPU we're on, we now work out this number at VM creation time
and store it in the kvm_arch struct.  That will make it possible to
get the number from the device tree in future, which will help with
compatibility with future processors.

Since mmu_partition_table_set_entry() does a global flush of the
whole LPID, we don't need to do the TLB flush on first entry to the
guest on each processor.  Therefore we don't set all bits in the
tlb_need_flush bitmap on VM startup on POWER9.
