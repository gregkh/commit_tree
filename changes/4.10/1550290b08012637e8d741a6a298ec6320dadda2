dax: dax_iomap_fault() needs to call iomap_end()

Currently iomap_end() doesn't do anything for DAX page faults for both ext2
and XFS.  ext2_iomap_end() just checks for a write underrun, and
xfs_file_iomap_end() checks to see if it needs to finish a delayed
allocation.  However, in the future iomap_end() calls might be needed to
make sure we have balanced allocations, locks, etc.  So, add calls to
iomap_end() with appropriate error handling to dax_iomap_fault().
