ARCv2: MCIP: Deprecate setting of affinity in Device Tree

Ignore value of interrupt distribution mode for common interrupts in
IDU since setting of affinity using value from Device Tree is deprecated
in ARC. Originally it is done in idu_irq_xlate() function and it is
semantically wrong and does not guaranty that an affinity value will be
set properly. idu_irq_enable() function is better place for
initialization of common interrupts.

By default send all common interrupts to all available online CPUs.
The affinity of common interrupts in IDU must be set manually since
in some cases the kernel will not call irq_set_affinity() by itself:

  1. When the kernel is not configured with support of SMP.
  2. When the kernel is configured with support of SMP but upper
     interrupt controllers does not support setting of the affinity
     and cannot propagate it to IDU.
