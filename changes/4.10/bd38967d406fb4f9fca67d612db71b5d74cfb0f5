arm64: Factor out PAN enabling/disabling into separate uaccess_* macros

This patch moves the directly coded alternatives for turning PAN on/off
into separate uaccess_{enable,disable} macros or functions. The asm
macros take a few arguments which will be used in subsequent patches.

Note that any (unlikely) access that the compiler might generate between
uaccess_enable() and uaccess_disable(), other than those explicitly
specified by the user access code, will not be protected by PAN.
