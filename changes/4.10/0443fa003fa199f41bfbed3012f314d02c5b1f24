swiotlb: Add support for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC

As a first step to making DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC apply to architectures
beyond just ARM I need to make it so that the swiotlb will respect the
flag.  In order to do that I also need to update the swiotlb-xen since it
heavily makes use of the functionality.
