PCI/ACPI: Provide acpi_get_rc_resources() for ARM64 platform

The acpi_get_rc_resources() is used to get the RC register address that can
not be described in MCFG.  It takes the _HID & segment to look for and
outputs the RC address resource.  Use PNP0C02 devices to describe such RC
address resource.  Use _UID to match segment to tell which root bus the
PNP0C02 resource belongs to.
