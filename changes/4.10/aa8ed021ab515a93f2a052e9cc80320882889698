bnxt_en: Move function reset to bnxt_init_one().

Now that MSIX is enabled in bnxt_init_one(), resources may be allocated by
the RDMA driver before the network device is opened.  So we cannot do
function reset in bnxt_open() which will clear all the resources.

The proper place to do function reset now is in bnxt_init_one().
If we get AER, we'll do function reset as well.
