clk: bcm2835: Avoid overwriting the div info when disabling a pll_div clk

bcm2835_pll_divider_off() is resetting the divider field in the A2W reg
to zero when disabling the clock.

Make sure we preserve this value by reading the previous a2w_reg value
first and ORing the result with A2W_PLL_CHANNEL_DISABLE.
