drm: tilcdc: simplify the recovery from sync lost error on rev1

Revision 2 of LCDC suffers from an issue where a SYNC_LOST error
caused by limited memory bandwidth may leave the picture shifted a
couple pixels to the right.

This issue has not been observed on revision 1, while the recovery
mechanism introduces a different issue, where the END_OF_FRAME
interrupt doesn't fire while drm is waiting for vblanks.

On rev1: recover from sync lost errors by simply clearing the
RASTER_ENABLE bit in the RASTER_CTRL register and re-enabling it
again as is suggested by the datasheet.
