gro: Disable frag0 optimization on IPv6 ext headers

The GRO fast path caches the frag0 address.  This address becomes
invalid if frag0 is modified by pskb_may_pull or its variants.
So whenever that happens we must disable the frag0 optimization.

This is usually done through the combination of gro_header_hard
and gro_header_slow, however, the IPv6 extension header path did
the pulling directly and would continue to use the GRO fast path
incorrectly.

This patch fixes it by disabling the fast path when we enter the
IPv6 extension header path.
