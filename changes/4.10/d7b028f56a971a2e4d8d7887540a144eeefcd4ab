zswap: disable changing params if init fails

Add zswap_init_failed bool that prevents changing any of the module
params, if init_zswap() fails, and set zswap_enabled to false.  Change
'enabled' param to a callback, and check zswap_init_failed before
allowing any change to 'enabled', 'zpool', or 'compressor' params.

Any driver that is built-in to the kernel will not be unloaded if its
init function returns error, and its module params remain accessible for
users to change via sysfs.  Since zswap uses param callbacks, which
assume that zswap has been initialized, changing the zswap params after
a failed initialization will result in WARNING due to the param
callbacks expecting a pool to already exist.  This prevents that by
immediately exiting any of the param callbacks if initialization failed.

This was reported here:
  https://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=147004228125528&w=4

And fixes this WARNING:
  [  429.723476] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5140 at mm/zswap.c:503 __zswap_pool_current+0x56/0x60

The warning is just noise, and not serious.  However, when init fails,
zswap frees all its percpu dstmem pages and its kmem cache.  The kmem
cache might be serious, if kmem_cache_alloc(NULL, gfp) has problems; but
the percpu dstmem pages are definitely a problem, as they're used as
temporary buffer for compressed pages before copying into place in the
zpool.

If the user does get zswap enabled after an init failure, then zswap
will likely Oops on the first page it tries to compress (or worse, start
corrupting memory).
