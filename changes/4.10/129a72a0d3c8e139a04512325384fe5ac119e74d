KVM: x86: Introduce segmented_write_std

Introduces segemented_write_std.

Switches from emulated reads/writes to standard read/writes in fxsave,
fxrstor, sgdt, and sidt.  This fixes CVE-2017-2584, a longstanding
kernel memory leak.

Since commit 283c95d0e389 ("KVM: x86: emulate FXSAVE and FXRSTOR",
2016-11-09), which is luckily not yet in any final release, this would
also be an exploitable kernel memory *write*!
