mfd: ab8500-core: Make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/mfd/Kconfig:config AB8500_CORE
drivers/mfd/Kconfig:    bool "ST-Ericsson AB8500 Mixed Signal Power Management chip"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since module_init was not in use by this code, the init ordering
remains unchanged with this commit.

We replace module.h with moduleparam.h ; the latter since this file
was implicitly relying on getting it.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
