powerpc: Initial stack protector (-fstack-protector) support

Partialy copied from commit c743f38013aef ("ARM: initial stack protector
(-fstack-protector) support")

This is the very basic stuff without the changing canary upon
task switch yet.  Just the Kconfig option and a constant canary
value initialized at boot time.
