ocfs2: replace CURRENT_TIME macro

CURRENT_TIME is not y2038 safe.

Use y2038 safe ktime_get_real_seconds() here for timestamps.  struct
heartbeat_block's hb_seq and deletetion time are already 64 bits wide
and accommodate times beyond y2038.

Also use y2038 safe ktime_get_real_ts64() for on disk inode timestamps.
These are also wide enough to accommodate time64_t.
