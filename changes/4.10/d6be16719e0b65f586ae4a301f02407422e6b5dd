perf tools: Add missing struct definition in probe_event.h

Commit 0b3c2264ae30 ("perf symbols: Fix kallsyms perf test on ppc64le")
refers struct symbol in probe_event.h, but forgets to include its
definition.  Gcc will complain about it when that definition is not
added, by sheer luck, by some other header included before
probe_event.h.
