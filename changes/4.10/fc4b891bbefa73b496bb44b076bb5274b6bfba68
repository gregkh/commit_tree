ubifs: Raise write version to 5

Starting with version 5 the following properties change:
 - UBIFS_FLG_DOUBLE_HASH is mandatory
 - UBIFS_FLG_ENCRYPTION is optional but depdens on UBIFS_FLG_DOUBLE_HASH
 - Filesystems with unknown super block flags will be rejected, this
   allows us in future to add new features without raising the UBIFS
   write version.
