dax: make 'wait_table' global variable static

The global 'wait_table' variable is only used within fs/dax.c, and
generates the following sparse warning:

fs/dax.c:39:19: warning: symbol 'wait_table' was not declared. Should it be static?

Make it static so it has scope local to fs/dax.c, and to make sparse happy.
