netfilter: x_tables: pack percpu counter allocations

instead of allocating each xt_counter individually, allocate 4k chunks
and then use these for counter allocation requests.

This should speed up rule evaluation by increasing data locality,
also speeds up ruleset loading because we reduce calls to the percpu
allocator.

As Eric points out we can't use PAGE_SIZE, page_allocator would fail on
arches with 64k page size.
