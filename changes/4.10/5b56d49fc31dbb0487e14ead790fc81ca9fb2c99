mm: add locked parameter to get_user_pages_remote()

Patch series "mm: unexport __get_user_pages_unlocked()".

This patch series continues the cleanup of get_user_pages*() functions
taking advantage of the fact we can now pass gup_flags as we please.

It firstly adds an additional 'locked' parameter to
get_user_pages_remote() to allow for its callers to utilise
VM_FAULT_RETRY functionality.  This is necessary as the invocation of
__get_user_pages_unlocked() in process_vm_rw_single_vec() makes use of
this and no other existing higher level function would allow it to do
so.

Secondly existing callers of __get_user_pages_unlocked() are replaced
with the appropriate higher-level replacement -
get_user_pages_unlocked() if the current task and memory descriptor are
referenced, or get_user_pages_remote() if other task/memory descriptors
are referenced (having acquiring mmap_sem.)

This patch (of 2):

Add a int *locked parameter to get_user_pages_remote() to allow
VM_FAULT_RETRY faulting behaviour similar to get_user_pages_[un]locked().

Taking into account the previous adjustments to get_user_pages*()
functions allowing for the passing of gup_flags, we are now in a
position where __get_user_pages_unlocked() need only be exported for his
ability to allow VM_FAULT_RETRY behaviour, this adjustment allows us to
subsequently unexport __get_user_pages_unlocked() as well as allowing
for future flexibility in the use of get_user_pages_remote().
