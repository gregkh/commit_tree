net: mvneta: Use cacheable memory to store the rx buffer virtual address

Until now the virtual address of the received buffer were stored in the
cookie field of the rx descriptor. However, this field is 32-bits only
which prevents to use the driver on a 64-bits architecture.

With this patch the virtual address is stored in an array not shared with
the hardware (no more need to use the DMA API). Thanks to this, it is
possible to use cache contrary to the access of the rx descriptor member.

The change is done in the swbm path only because the hwbm uses the cookie
field, this also means that currently the hwbm is not usable in 64-bits.
