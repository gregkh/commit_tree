net: thunderx: Fix transmit queue timeout issue

Transmit queue timeout issue is seen in two cases
- Due to a race condition btw setting stop_queue at xmit()
  and checking for stopped_queue in NAPI poll routine, at times
  transmission from a SQ comes to a halt. This is fixed
  by using barriers and also added a check for SQ free descriptors,
  incase SQ is stopped and there are only CQE_RX i.e no CQE_TX.
- Contrary to an assumption, a HW errata where HW doesn't stop transmission
  even though there are not enough CQEs available for a CQE_TX is
  not fixed in T88 pass 2.x. This results in a Qset error with
  'CQ_WR_FULL' stalling transmission. This is fixed by adjusting
  RXQ's  RED levels for CQ level such that there is always enough
  space left for CQE_TXs.
