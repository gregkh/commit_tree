USB: serial: keyspan_pda: verify endpoints at probe

Check for the expected endpoints in attach() and fail loudly if not
present.

Note that failing to do this appears to be benign since da280e348866
("USB: keyspan_pda: clean up write-urb busy handling") which prevents a
NULL-pointer dereference in write() by never marking a non-existent
write-urb as free.
