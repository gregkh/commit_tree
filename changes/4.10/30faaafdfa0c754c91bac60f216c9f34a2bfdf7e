xen/gntdev: Use VM_MIXEDMAP instead of VM_IO to avoid NUMA balancing

Commit 9c17d96500f7 ("xen/gntdev: Grant maps should not be subject to
NUMA balancing") set VM_IO flag to prevent grant maps from being
subjected to NUMA balancing.

It was discovered recently that this flag causes get_user_pages() to
always fail with -EFAULT.

check_vma_flags
__get_user_pages
__get_user_pages_locked
__get_user_pages_unlocked
get_user_pages_fast
iov_iter_get_pages
dio_refill_pages
do_direct_IO
do_blockdev_direct_IO
do_blockdev_direct_IO
ext4_direct_IO_read
generic_file_read_iter
aio_run_iocb

(which can happen if guest's vdisk has direct-io-safe option).

To avoid this let's use VM_MIXEDMAP flag instead --- it prevents
NUMA balancing just as VM_IO does and has no effect on
check_vma_flags().
