sctp: reuse sent_count to avoid retransmitted chunks for RTT measurements

Now sctp uses chunk->resent to record if a chunk is retransmitted, for
RTT measurements with retransmitted DATA chunks. chunk->sent_count was
introduced to record how many times one chunk has been sent for prsctp
RTX policy before. We actually can know if one chunk is retransmitted
by checking chunk->sent_count is greater than 1.

This patch is to remove resent from sctp_chunk and reuse sent_count
to avoid retransmitted chunks for RTT measurements.
