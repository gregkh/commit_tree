serial: 8250_dma: power off device after TX is done

When any 8250 based driver sets up DMA and has UART_CAP_RPM capability enabled
the device is left powered on after transfer is done. We need to schedule a
device suspend operation when DMA completes the transfer.

The patch is based on the work done by the reporter.
