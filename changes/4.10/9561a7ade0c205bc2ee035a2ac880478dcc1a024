nbd: add multi-connection support

NBD can become contended on its single connection.  We have to serialize all
writes and we can only process one read response at a time.  Fix this by
allowing userspace to provide multiple connections to a single nbd device.  This
coupled with block-mq drastically increases performance in multi-process cases.
