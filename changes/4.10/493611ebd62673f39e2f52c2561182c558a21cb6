xfs: extsize hints are not unlikely in xfs_bmap_btalloc

With COW files they are the hotpath, just like for files with the
extent size hint attribute.  We really shouldn't micro-manage anything
but failure cases with unlikely.

Additionally Arnd Bergmann recently reported that one of these two
unlikely annotations causes link failures together with an upcoming
kernel instrumentation patch, so let's get rid of it ASAP.
