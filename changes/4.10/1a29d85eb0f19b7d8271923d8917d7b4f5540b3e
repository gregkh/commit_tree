mm: use vmf->address instead of of vmf->virtual_address

Every single user of vmf->virtual_address typed that entry to unsigned
long before doing anything with it so the type of virtual_address does
not really provide us any additional safety.  Just use masked
vmf->address which already has the appropriate type.
