qede: Better utilize the qede_[rt]x_queue

Improve the cacheline usage of both queues by reordering -
This reduces the cachelines required for egress datapath processing
from 3 to 2 and those required by ingress datapath processing by 2.

It also changes a couple of datapath related functions that currently
require either the fastpath or the qede_dev, changing them to be based
on the tx/rx queue instead.
