ASoC: nau8825: Disable short Frame Sync detection logic

If the short Frame Sync detection logic enabled, the logic will check the
short frame sync threshold. If frame sync is less than the setting;
for example, frame sync less than 252 MCLK, the short frame sync signal is
flagged, digital filter temporary mute and skip that data.

If the system was intended for sampling rate change which could create
temporary short frame sync and not enough MIPS to run the digital filter.
But the situation doesn't happen in ALSA architecure. Thus the Frame Sync
is always stable, then no require to do the detection. Therefore,
the dirver disables the function for better performance.
