ipmi: Fix sequence number handling

The IPMI message handler uses a message id that the lower-layer
preserved to track the sequence number of the message.  The macros
that handled these sequence numbers were somewhat broken as they
could result in sequence number truncation and they were not
doing an "and" of the proper number of bits.

I think this actually is not a problem, because the truncation
should be harmless and the improper "and" didn't hurt anything
because sequence number generation used the same improper "and"
and wouldn't generate a sequence number that would get
truncated wrong.  However, it should be fixed.
