mei: enable to set the internal flag for client write

Prepare the client write functions to set the internal flag in message
header. Carry both blocking and internal modes inside the transmit cb,
and call internal bus function  __mei_cl_send() with send mode bit mask.
The Internal flag should be added only on messages generated by the
driver.
