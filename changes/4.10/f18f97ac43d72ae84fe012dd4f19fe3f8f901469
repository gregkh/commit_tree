tracing/kprobes: Add a helper method to return number of probe hits

The number of probe hits is stored in a percpu variable and therefore
can't be read directly. Add a helper method trace_kprobe_nhit() that
performs the required calculation.

It will be used in a follow-up commit that changes kprobe selftests to
verify the number of probe hits.
