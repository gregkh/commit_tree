ext4: tell DAX the size of allocation holes

When DAX calls _ext4_get_block() and the file offset points to a hole we
currently don't set bh->b_size.  This is current worked around via
buffer_size_valid() in fs/dax.c.

_ext4_get_block() has the hole size information from ext4_map_blocks(), so
populate bh->b_size so we can remove buffer_size_valid() in a later patch.
