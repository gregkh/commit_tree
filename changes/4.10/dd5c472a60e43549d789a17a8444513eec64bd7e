ppdev: check before attaching port

After parport starts using the device model, all pardevice drivers
should decide in their match_port callback function if they want to
attach with that particulatr port. ppdev has been converted to use the
new parport device-model code but pp_attach() tried to attach with all
the ports.
Create a new array of pointer and use that to remember the ports we
have attached. And use that information to skip attaching ports which
we have already attached.
