drm: prevent double-(un)registration for connectors

If we're unlucky then the registration from a hotplugged connector
might race with the final registration step on driver load. And since
MST topology discover is asynchronous that's even somewhat likely.

v2: Also update the kerneldoc for @registered!

v3: Review from Chris:
- Improve kerneldoc for late_register/early_unregister callbacks.
- Use mutex_destroy.
