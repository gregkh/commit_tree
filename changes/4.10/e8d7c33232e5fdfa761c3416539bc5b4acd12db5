md/raid5: limit request size according to implementation limits

Current implementation employ 16bit counter of active stripes in lower
bits of bio->bi_phys_segments. If request is big enough to overflow
this counter bio will be completed and freed too early.

Fortunately this not happens in default configuration because several
other limits prevent that: stripe_cache_size * nr_disks effectively
limits count of active stripes. And small max_sectors_kb at lower
disks prevent that during normal read/write operations.

Overflow easily happens in discard if it's enabled by module parameter
"devices_handle_discard_safely" and stripe_cache_size is set big enough.

This patch limits requests size with 256Mb - 8Kb to prevent overflows.
