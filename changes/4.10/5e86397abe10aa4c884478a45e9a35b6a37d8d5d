net/mlx5e: Properly handle FW errors while adding TC rules

When the firmware returns an error (common example is an attempt to
add twice the same rule which is refused by the some FWs), we are not
properly derefing/cleaning few resources allocated on the way.
Examples are vport vlan deref under eswitch vlan offloads, and encap
entry/neighbour deref under eswitch encapsulation offloads, fix that.
