fs: Add helper to clean bdev aliases under a bh and use it

Add a helper function that clears buffer heads from a block device
aliasing passed bh. Use this helper function from filesystems instead of
the original unmap_underlying_metadata() to save some boiler plate code
and also have a better name for the functionalily since it is not
unmapping anything for a *long* time.
