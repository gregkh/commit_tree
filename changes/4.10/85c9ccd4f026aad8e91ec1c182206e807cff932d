md/bitmap: Don't write bitmap while earlier writes might be in-flight

As we don't wait for writes to complete in bitmap_daemon_work, they
could still be in-flight when bitmap_unplug writes again.  Or when
bitmap_daemon_work tries to write again.
This can be confusing and could risk the wrong data being written last.

So make sure we wait for old writes to complete before new writes start.
