ipv6: sr: remove cleanup flag and fix HMAC computation

In the latest version of the IPv6 Segment Routing IETF draft [1] the
cleanup flag is removed and the flags field length is shrunk from 16 bits
to 8 bits. As a consequence, the input of the HMAC computation is modified
in a non-backward compatible way by covering the whole octet of flags
instead of only the cleanup bit. As such, if an implementation compatible
with the latest draft computes the HMAC of an SRH who has other flags set
to 1, then the HMAC result would differ from the current implementation.

This patch carries those modifications to prevent conflict with other
implementations of IPv6 SR.
