VME: Remove shutdown entry from vme_driver

The vme_driver structure currently has a "shutdown" entry. This entry is
never used, it lacks the correct parameter (it should be providing a
pointer to the relevant vme_dev struct to even *look* usable), the VME
subsystem currently doesn't provide support for shutdown functions and no
in-tree drivers use it (hardly surprising, given it'd never be called).

Remove the entry from vme_driver to avoid confusion.
