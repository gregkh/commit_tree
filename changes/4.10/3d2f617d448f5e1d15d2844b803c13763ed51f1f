scsi: cxlflash: Improve context_reset() logic

Currently, the context reset routine waits for command room to
be available before sending the reset request. Per review of the
SISLite specification and clarifications from the CXL Flash AFU
designers, this wait is unnecessary. The reset request can be
sent anytime regardless of command room, so long as only a single
reset request is active at any one point in time.

This commit simplifies the reset routine by removing the wait for
command room. Additionally it adds a debug trace to help pinpoint
hardware errors when a context reset does not complete.
