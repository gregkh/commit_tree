hwmon: (core) Simplify sysfs attribute name allocation

Allocating the sysfs attribute name only if needed and only with the
required minimum length looks optimal, but does not take the additional
overhead for both devm_ data structures and the allocation header itself
into account. This also results in unnecessary memory fragmentation.
Move the sysfs name string into struct hwmon_device_attribute and give it
a sufficient length to reduce this overhead.
