swiotlb: Rate-limit printing when running out of SW-IOMMU space

If the system runs out of SW-IOMMU space, changes are high successive
requests will fail, too, flooding the kernel log.  This is true
especially for streaming DMA, which is typically used repeatedly outside
the driver's initialization routine.  Add rate-limiting to fix this.

While at it, get rid of the open-coded dev_name() handling by using the
appropriate dev_err_*() variant.
