[media] ttpci: cleanup debug macros and remove dead code

Continuation lines without KERN_CONT won't work anymore.
However, the way dprintk() was defined leads to the usage
of continuation lines, with should be avoided when possible.

So, redefine those macros.

While hre, remove some dead code at av7110.c with also
relies on continuation lines.
