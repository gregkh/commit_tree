module: unify absolute krctab definitions for 32-bit and 64-bit

The previous patch introduced a separate inline asm version of the
krcrctab declaration template for use with 64-bit architectures, which
cannot refer to ELF symbols using 32-bit quantities.

This declaration should be equivalent to the C one for 32-bit
architectures, but just in case - unify them in a separate patch, which
can simply be dropped if it turns out to break anything.
