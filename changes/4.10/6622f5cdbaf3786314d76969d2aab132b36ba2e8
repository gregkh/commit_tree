i40e: make use of __dev_uc_sync and __dev_mc_sync

The kernel provides __dev_uc_sync and __dev_mc_sync in order for drivers
which need individual notification of add and delete for each filter.
These functions allow us to vastly simplify our .set_rx_mode handler. We
need to implement two functions for sync and unsync which add and remove
filters respectively.

This change avoids a very complex and inefficient algorithm which
resulted in an abnormal latency for the .set_rx_mode NDO operation. The
resulting code after this change is more readable, more efficient, and
less code.

Due to the callback signature used by these functions we also must
update several other functions to take a const u8 * pointer.
