x86/microcode/AMD: Reload proper initrd start address

When we switch to virtual addresses and, especially after
reserve_initrd()->relocate_initrd() have run, we have the updated initrd
address in initrd_start. Use initrd_start then instead of the address
which has been passed to us through boot params. (That still gets used
when we're running the very early routines on the BSP).
