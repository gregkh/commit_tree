net: core: add missing check for uid_range in rule_exists.

Without this check, it is not possible to create two rules that
are identical except for their UID ranges. For example:

root@net-test:/# ip rule add prio 1000 lookup 300
root@net-test:/# ip rule add prio 1000 uidrange 100-200 lookup 300
RTNETLINK answers: File exists
root@net-test:/# ip rule add prio 1000 uidrange 100-199 lookup 100
root@net-test:/# ip rule add prio 1000 uidrange 200-299 lookup 200
root@net-test:/# ip rule add prio 1000 uidrange 300-399 lookup 100
RTNETLINK answers: File exists
