openvswitch: add mac_proto field to the flow key

Use a hole in the structure. We support only Ethernet so far and will add
a support for L2-less packets shortly. We could use a bool to indicate
whether the Ethernet header is present or not but the approach with the
mac_proto field is more generic and occupies the same number of bytes in the
struct, while allowing later extensibility. It also makes the code in the
next patches more self explaining.

It would be nice to use ARPHRD_ constants but those are u16 which would be
waste. Thus define our own constants.

Another upside of this is that we can overload this new field to also denote
whether the flow key is valid. This has the advantage that on
refragmentation, we don't have to reparse the packet but can rely on the
stored eth.type. This is especially important for the next patches in this
series - instead of adding another branch for L2-less packets before calling
ovs_fragment, we can just remove all those branches completely.
