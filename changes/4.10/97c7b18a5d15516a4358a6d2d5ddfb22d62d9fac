mbcache: remove unnecessary module_get/module_put

When mbcache is built as a module, any modules that use it (ext2 and/or
ext4) will depend on its symbols directly, incrementing its reference
count.  Therefore, there is no need to do module_get/module_put.

Also note that since the module_get/module_put were in the mbcache
module itself, executing those lines of code was already dependent on
another reference to the mbcache module being held.
