ieee802154: atusb: implement .set_frame_retries ops callback

From firmware version 0.3 onwards we use the TX_ARET mode allowing for automatic
frame retransmissions. To actually make use of this feature we need to implement
the callback for setting the frame retries.

If the firmware version is to old print a warning and return with invalid value.
