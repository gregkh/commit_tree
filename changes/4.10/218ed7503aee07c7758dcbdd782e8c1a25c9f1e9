radix-tree: improve dump output

Print the indices of the entries as unsigned (instead of signed)
integers and print the parent node of each entry to help navigate around
larger trees where the layout is not quite so obvious.  Print the
indices covered by a node.  Rearrange the order of fields printed so the
indices and parents line up for each type of entry.
