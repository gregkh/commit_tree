staging: lustre: hsm: prevent migration of HSM archived files

The reference copytool cannot handle migration of HSM archive
files. In the MDT migration path check for HSM attributes and fail if
they are present. In the LMV layer allow creation of volatile files
with any MDT index. Add a test to sanity-hsm to ensure that attempting
to migrate an HSM archive file is handled safely.
