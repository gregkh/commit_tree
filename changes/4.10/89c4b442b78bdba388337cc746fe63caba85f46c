netpoll: more efficient locking

Callers of netpoll_poll_lock() own NAPI_STATE_SCHED

Callers of netpoll_poll_unlock() have BH blocked between
the NAPI_STATE_SCHED being cleared and poll_lock is released.

We can avoid the spinlock which has no contention, and use cmpxchg()
on poll_owner which we need to set anyway.

This removes a possible lockdep violation after the cited commit,
since sk_busy_loop() re-enables BH before calling busy_poll_stop()
