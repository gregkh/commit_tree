usb: gadget: composite: always set ep->mult to a sensible value

ep->mult is supposed to be set to Isochronous and
Interrupt Endapoint's multiplier value. This value
is computed from different places depending on the
link speed.

If we're dealing with HighSpeed, then it's part of
bits [12:11] of wMaxPacketSize. This case wasn't
taken into consideration before.

While at that, also make sure the ep->mult defaults
to one so drivers can use it unconditionally and
assume they'll never multiply ep->maxpacket to zero.
