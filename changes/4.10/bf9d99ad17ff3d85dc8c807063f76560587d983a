drm/i915/gen9: Make skl_pipe_wm_get_hw_state() reusable

There's not much of a reason this should have the locations to read out
the hardware state hardcoded, so allow the caller to specify the
location and add this function to intel_drv.h. As well, we're going to
need this function to be reusable for the next patch.

Changes since v1:
- Fix accidental behavior change in the code that Paulo pointed out
