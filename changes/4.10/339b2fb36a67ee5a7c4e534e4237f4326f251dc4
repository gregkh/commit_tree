ARM: dts: exynos: Add TOPEET itop elite based board

The TOPEET itop Exynos4412 has three versions of base boards. The
Elite version is the cheap one without too much peripheral devices
on it.

Currently supported are serial console, wired networking (USB), USB OTG
in peripheral mode, USB host, SD storage, GPIO buttons, PWM beeper, ADC
and LEDs. The WM8960 analog audio codec is also enabled.

The FIMC is not used for camera currently, I enabled it just for a
colorspace converter.
