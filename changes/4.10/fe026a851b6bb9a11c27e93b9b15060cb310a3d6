kbuild: thin archives for multi-y targets

THIN_ARCHIVES builds archives for built-in.o targets, have it build
multi-y targets as archives as well.

This saves another ~15% of the size of intermediate artifacts in the
build tree. After this patch, the linker is only used in final link,
and special cases like vdsos.
