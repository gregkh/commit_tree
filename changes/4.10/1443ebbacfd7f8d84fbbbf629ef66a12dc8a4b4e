cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix sysfs limits enforcement for performance policy

A side effect of keeping intel_pstate sysfs limits in sync with cpufreq
is that the now sysfs limits can't enforced under performance policy.

For example, if the max_perf_pct is changed from 100 to 80, this will call
intel_pstate_set_policy(), which will change the max_perf to 100 again for
performance policy. Same issue happens, when no_turbo is set.

This change calculates max and min frequency using sysfs performance
limits in intel_pstate_verify_policy() and adjusts policy limits by
calling cpufreq_verify_within_limits().

Also, it causes the setting of performance limits to be skipped if
no_turbo is set.
