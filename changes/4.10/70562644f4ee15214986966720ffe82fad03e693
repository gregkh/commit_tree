mmc: core: Don't use ->card_busy() and CMD13 in combination when polling

When polling for busy after sending a MMC_SWITCH command, both the optional
->card_busy() callback and CMD13 are being used in conjunction.

This doesn't make sense. Instead it's more reasonable to rely solely on the
->card_busy() callback when it exists. Let's change that and instead use
the CMD13 as a fall-back. In this way we avoid sending CMD13, unless it's
really needed.

Within this context, let's also take the opportunity to make some
additional clean-ups and clarifications to the related code.
