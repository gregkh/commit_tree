x86/sysctl: Add sysctl for ITMT scheduling feature

Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 (ITMT) feature
allows some cores to be boosted to higher turbo
frequency than others.

Add /proc/sys/kernel/sched_itmt_enabled so operator
can enable/disable scheduling of tasks that favor cores
with higher turbo boost frequency potential.

By default, system that is ITMT capable and single
socket has this feature turned on.  It is more likely
to be lightly loaded and operates in Turbo range.

When there is a change in the ITMT scheduling operation
desired, a rebuild of the sched domain is initiated
so the scheduler can set up sched domains with appropriate
flag to enable/disable ITMT scheduling operations.
