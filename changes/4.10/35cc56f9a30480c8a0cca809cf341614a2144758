tty: vgacon+sisusb, move scrolldelta to a common helper

The code is mirrorred in scrolldelta implementations of both vgacon
and sisusb. Let's move the code to a separate helper where we will
perform a common cleanup and further changes.

While we are moving the code, make it linear and save one indentation
level. This is done by returning from the "!lines" then-branch
immediatelly. This allows flushing the else-branch 1 level to the
left, obviously.

Few more new lines and comments were added too.

And do not forget to export the helper function given sisusb can be
built as module.
