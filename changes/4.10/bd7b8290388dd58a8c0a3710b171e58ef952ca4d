fscrypt: Cleanup page locking requirements for fscrypt_{decrypt,encrypt}_page()

Rename the FS_CFLG_INPLACE_ENCRYPTION flag to FS_CFLG_OWN_PAGES which,
when set, indicates that the fs uses pages under its own control as
opposed to writeback pages which require locking and a bounce buffer for
encryption.
