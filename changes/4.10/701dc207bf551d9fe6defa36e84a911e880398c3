i2c: piix4: Avoid race conditions with IMC

On AMD's SB800 and upwards, the SMBus is shared with the Integrated
Micro Controller (IMC).

The platform provides a hardware semaphore to avoid race conditions
among them. (Check page 288 of the SB800-Series Southbridges Register
Reference Guide http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/45482.pdf)

Without this patch, many access to the SMBus end with an invalid
transaction or even with the bus stalled.
