xfs: clear _XBF_PAGES from buffers when readahead page

If we try to allocate memory pages to back an xfs_buf that we're trying
to read, it's possible that we'll be so short on memory that the page
allocation fails.  For a blocking read we'll just wait, but for
readahead we simply dump all the pages we've collected so far.

Unfortunately, after dumping the pages we neglect to clear the
_XBF_PAGES state, which means that the subsequent call to xfs_buf_free
thinks that b_pages still points to pages we own.  It then double-frees
the b_pages pages.

This results in screaming about negative page refcounts from the memory
manager, which xfs oughtn't be triggering.  To reproduce this case,
mount a filesystem where the size of the inodes far outweighs the
availalble memory (a ~500M inode filesystem on a VM with 300MB memory
did the trick here) and run bulkstat in parallel with other memory
eating processes to put a huge load on the system.  The "check summary"
phase of xfs_scrub also works for this purpose.
