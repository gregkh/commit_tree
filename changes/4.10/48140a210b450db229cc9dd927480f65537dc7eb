driver: ipvlan: Free ipvl_port directly with kfree instead of kfree_rcu

There are two functions which would free the ipvl_port now. The first
is ipvlan_port_create. It frees the ipvl_port in the error handler,
so it could kfree it directly. The second is ipvlan_port_destroy. It
invokes netdev_rx_handler_unregister which enforces one grace period
by synchronize_net firstly, so it also could kfree the ipvl_port
directly and safely.

So it is unnecessary to use kfree_rcu to free ipvl_port.
