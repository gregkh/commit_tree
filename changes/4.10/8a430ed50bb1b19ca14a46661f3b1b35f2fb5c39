net: ipv4: fix table id in getroute response

rtm_table is an 8-bit field while table ids are allowed up to u32. Commit
709772e6e065 ("net: Fix routing tables with id > 255 for legacy software")
added the preference to set rtm_table in dumps to RT_TABLE_COMPAT if the
table id is > 255. The table id returned on get route requests should do
the same.
