mmc: dw_mmc: call the dw_mci_prep_stop_abort() by default

stop_cmdr should be set to values relevant to stop command.
It migth be assigned to values whatever there is mrq->stop or not.
Then it doesn't need to use dw_mci_prepare_command().
It's enough to use the prep_stop_abort for preparing stop command.
