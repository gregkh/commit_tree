drm/amdgpu: rework IP block registration (v2)

This makes it easier to replace specific IP blocks on
asics for handling virtual_dce, DAL, etc. and for building
IP lists for hw or tables.  This also stored the status
information in the same structure.

v2: split out spelling fix into a separate patch
    add a function to add IPs to the list
