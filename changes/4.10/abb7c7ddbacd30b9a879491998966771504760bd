KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Adapt to new HPTE format on POWER9

This adapts the KVM-HV hashed page table (HPT) code to read and write
HPT entries in the new format defined in Power ISA v3.00 on POWER9
machines.  The new format moves the B (segment size) field from the
first doubleword to the second, and trims some bits from the AVA
(abbreviated virtual address) and ARPN (abbreviated real page number)
fields.  As far as possible, the conversion is done when reading or
writing the HPT entries, and the rest of the code continues to use
the old format.
