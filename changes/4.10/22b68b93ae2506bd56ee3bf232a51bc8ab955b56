rtlwifi: Fix kernel oops introduced with commit e49656147359

With commit e49656147359 {"rtlwifi: Use dev_kfree_skb_irq instead of
kfree_skb"), the method used to free an skb was changed because the
kfree_skb() was inside a spinlock. What was forgotten is that kfree_skb()
guards against a NULL value for the argument. Routine dev_kfree_skb_irq()
does not, and a test is needed to prevent kernel panics.
