tcp: don't annotate mark on control socket from tcp_v6_send_response()

Unlike ipv4, this control socket is shared by all cpus so we cannot use
it as scratchpad area to annotate the mark that we pass to ip6_xmit().

Add a new parameter to ip6_xmit() to indicate the mark. The SCTP socket
family caches the flowi6 structure in the sctp_transport structure, so
we cannot use to carry the mark unless we later on reset it back, which
I discarded since it looks ugly to me.

Fixes: bf99b4ded5f8 ("tcp: fix mark propagation with fwmark_reflect enabled")
