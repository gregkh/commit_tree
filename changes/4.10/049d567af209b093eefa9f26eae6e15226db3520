powerpc/mm: Introduce _PAGE_LARGE software pte bits

This patch adds a new software defined pte bit. We use the reserved
fields of ISA 3.0 pte definition since we will only be using this on DD1
code paths. We can possibly look at removing this code later.

The software bit will be used to differentiate between 64K/4K and 2M
ptes. This helps in finding the page size mapping by a pte so that we
can do efficient tlb flush.

We don't support 1G hugetlb pages yet. So we add a DEBUG WARN_ON to
catch wrong usage.
