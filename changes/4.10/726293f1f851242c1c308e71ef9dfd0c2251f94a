net/mlx5e: Save the represntor netdevice as part of the representor

Replace the representor private data to a net_device pointer holding the
representor netdevice, instead of void pointer holding mlx5e_priv.

It will be used by a new eswitch service function, returning the uplink representor
netdevice.
