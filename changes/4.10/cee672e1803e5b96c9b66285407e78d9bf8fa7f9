s390: hypfs: make inode explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/s390/Kconfig:config S390_HYPFS_FS
arch/s390/Kconfig:      def_bool y

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_ALIAS is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.

Build testing indicated the presence of module.h was masking an
implicit include of kobject.h, hence the addition of that.
