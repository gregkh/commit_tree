net: phy: leds: Fix truncated LED trigger names

Commit 4567d686f5c6d955 ("phy: increase size of MII_BUS_ID_SIZE and
bus_id") increased the size of MII bus IDs, but forgot to update the
private definition in <linux/phy_led_triggers.h>.
This may cause:
  1. Truncation of LED trigger names,
  2. Duplicate LED trigger names,
  3. Failures registering LED triggers,
  4. Crashes due to bad error handling in the LED trigger failure path.

To fix this, and prevent the definitions going out of sync again in the
future, let the PHY LED trigger code use the existing MII_BUS_ID_SIZE
definition.

Example:
  - Before I had triggers "ee700000.etherne:01:100Mbps" and
    "ee700000.etherne:01:10Mbps",
  - After the increase of MII_BUS_ID_SIZE, both became
    "ee700000.ethernet-ffffffff:01:" => FAIL,
  - Now, the triggers are "ee700000.ethernet-ffffffff:01:100Mbps" and
    "ee700000.ethernet-ffffffff:01:10Mbps", which are unique again.
