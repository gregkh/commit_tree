PCI/MSI: Provide pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity()

This is a variant of pci_alloc_irq_vectors() that allows passing a struct
irq_affinity to provide fine-grained IRQ affinity control.

For now this means being able to exclude vectors at the beginning or end of
the MSI vector space, but it could also be used for any other quirks needed
in the future (e.g. more vectors than CPUs, or excluding CPUs from the
spreading).
