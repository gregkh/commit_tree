drm: Take ownership of the dmabuf->obj when exporting

Currently the reference for the dmabuf->obj is incremented for the
dmabuf in drm_gem_prime_handle_to_fd() (at the high level userspace
interface), but is released in drm_gem_dmabuf_release() (the lowlevel
handler). Improve the symmetry of the dmabuf->obj ownership by acquiring
the reference in drm_gem_dmabuf_export(). This makes it easier to use
the prime functions directly.
