scsi: ufs: suspend clock scaling for failed runtime_resume

During runtime resume operation, clock scaling may get indirectly
resumed via call to ufshcd_set_dev_pwr_mode(): Start/Stop Unit command
times out and SCSI error handling ultimately calls the host reset
handler to recover, during which clock scaling is resumed.  Error case
exit path of runtime resume will disable clocks.  As clock scaling was
already resumed, it will get scheduled later on and try to access UFS
registers while clocks are disabled, resulting in unclocked register
access.
