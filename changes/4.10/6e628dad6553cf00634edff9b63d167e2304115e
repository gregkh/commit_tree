mmc: davinci: request gpios using gpio descriptors

Request card detect and write protect gpios using the provided API
by mmc core.

If a gpio is provided for card detect, we don't need to poll.
So only use polling when a gpio is not provided.

Once all pdata users register the gpios using gpio descriptors,
we could remove the platform callbacks.
