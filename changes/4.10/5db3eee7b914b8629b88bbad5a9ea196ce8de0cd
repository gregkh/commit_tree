mmc: mmci: clean up header defines

There was some confusion in the CPSM (Command Path State Machine)
and DPSM (Data Path State Machine) regarding the naming of the
registers, clarify the meaning of this acronym so the naming is
understandable, and consistently use BIT() to define these fields.

Consequently name the register bit defines MCI_[C|D]PSM_* and
adjust the driver as well.

Include new definitions for a few bits found in a patch from
Srinivas Kandagatla.
