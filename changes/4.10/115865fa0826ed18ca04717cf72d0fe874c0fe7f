mac80211: don't try to sleep in rate_control_rate_init()

In my previous patch, I missed that rate_control_rate_init() is
called from some places that cannot sleep, so it cannot call
ieee80211_recalc_min_chandef(). Remove that call for now to fix
the context bug, we'll have to find a different way to fix the
minimum channel width issue.
