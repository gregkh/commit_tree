powerpc/perf: Use MSR to report privilege level on P9 DD1

SIER and SIAR are not updated correctly for some samples, so force the
use of MSR and regs->nip instead for misc_flag updates. This is done by
adding a new ppmu flag and updating the use_siar logic in
perf_read_regs() to use it, and dropping the PPMU_HAS_SIER flag.
