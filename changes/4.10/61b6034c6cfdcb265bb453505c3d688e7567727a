net/mlx4_en: Fix type mismatch for 32-bit systems

is_power_of_2 expects unsigned long and we pass u64 max_val_cycles,
this will be truncated on 32 bit systems, and the result is not what we
were expecting.
div_u64 expects u32 as a second argument and we pass
max_val_cycles_rounded which is u64 hence it will always be truncated.
Fix was tested on both 64 and 32 bit systems and got same results for
max_val_cycles and max_val_cycles_rounded.
