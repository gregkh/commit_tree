tpm: Fix handling of missing event log

The event log is an optional firmware feature, if the firmware
does not support it then the securityfs files should not be created
and no other notification given.

- Uniformly return -ENODEV from the tpm_bios_log_setup cone if
  no event log is detected.
- Check in ACPI if this node was discovered via ACPI.
- Improve the check in OF to make sure there is a parent and to
  fail detection if the two log properties are not declared
- Pass through all other error codes instead of filtering just some
