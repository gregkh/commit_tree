ASoC: cs35l34: Simplify the logic to set CS35L34_MCLK_CTL setting

The logic of "value = ~CS35L34_MCLK_DIV & CS35L34_MCLK_RATE_XXXXXX;" is
unnecessary complex. By setting CS35L34_MCLK_DIV | CS35L34_MCLK_RATE_MASK
as the mask for regmap_update_bits() call, what the code does is exactly
the same as setting value = CS35L34_MCLK_RATE_XXXXXX.
