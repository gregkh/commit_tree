mm: fix KPF_SWAPCACHE in /proc/kpageflags

Commit 6326fec1122c ("mm: Use owner_priv bit for PageSwapCache, valid
when PageSwapBacked") aliased PG_swapcache to PG_owner_priv_1 (and
depending on PageSwapBacked being true).

As a result, the KPF_SWAPCACHE bit in '/proc/kpageflags' should now be
synthesized, instead of being shown on unrelated pages which just happen
to have PG_owner_priv_1 set.
