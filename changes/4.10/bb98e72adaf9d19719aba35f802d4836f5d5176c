drm/i915/dsi: Do not clear DPOUNIT_CLOCK_GATE_DISABLE from vlv_init_display_clock_gating

On my Cherrytrail CUBE iwork8 Air tablet PIPE-A would get stuck on loading
i915 at boot 1 out of every 3 boots, resulting in a non functional LCD.
Once the i915 driver has successfully loaded, the panel can be disabled /
enabled without hitting this issue.

The getting stuck is caused by vlv_init_display_clock_gating() clearing
the DPOUNIT_CLOCK_GATE_DISABLE bit in DSPCLK_GATE_D when called from
chv_pipe_power_well_ops.enable() on driver load, while a pipe is enabled
driving the DSI LCD by the BIOS.

Clearing this bit while DSI is in use is a known issue and
intel_dsi_pre_enable() / intel_dsi_post_disable() already set / clear it
as appropriate.

This commit modifies vlv_init_display_clock_gating() to leave the
DPOUNIT_CLOCK_GATE_DISABLE bit alone fixing the pipe getting stuck.

Changes in v2:
-Replace PIPE-A with "a pipe" or "the pipe" in the commit msg and
comment
