mxs-auart: count FIFO overrun errors

The mxs-auart driver does not count FIFO overrun errors. These errors never
appear in /proc/tty/driver/ttyAPP. This is because the OERR status bit is
masked by read_status_mask in the rx interrupt function, but the
AUART_STAT_OERR bit is never set in read_status_mask. The patch enables the
counting of overrun errors.
