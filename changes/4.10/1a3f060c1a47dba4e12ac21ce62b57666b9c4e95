net: Introduce new api for walking upper and lower devices

This patch introduces netdev_walk_all_upper_dev_rcu,
netdev_walk_all_lower_dev and netdev_walk_all_lower_dev_rcu. These
functions recursively walk the adj_list of devices to determine all upper
and lower devices.

The functions take a callback function that is invoked for each device
in the list. If the callback returns non-0, the walk is terminated and
the functions return that code back to callers.

v3
- simplified netdev_has_upper_dev_all_rcu and __netdev_has_upper_dev and
  removed typecast as suggested by Stephen

v2
- fixed definition of netdev_next_lower_dev_rcu to mirror the upper_dev
  version.
