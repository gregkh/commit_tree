ipmi: create hardware-independent softdep for ipmi_devintf

When a computer has an IPMI system interface, the device interface
is most probably also desired. Autoloading of ipmi_devintf currently
works only if ipmi_si has allocated a platform device. That doesn't
happen if the SI interface was detected e.g. via ACPI. But ACPI
detection is preferred these days, see e.g. kernel.org bug 46741.

This patch introduces a softdep in place of the existing modalias
for ipmi_devintf.

I moved this to ipmi_msghandler.c, so it works for all IPMI
interfaces.  Retested by Martin.
