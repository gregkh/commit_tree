[media] exynos4-is: fimc: Roundup imagesize to row size for tiled formats

For tiled format, we need to allocated a multiple of the row size. A
good example is for 1280x720, wich get adjusted to 1280x736. In tiles,
this mean Y plane is 20x23 and UV plane 20x12. Because of the rounding,
the previous code would only have enough space to fit half of the last
row.
