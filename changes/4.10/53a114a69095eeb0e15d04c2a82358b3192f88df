x86/intel_rdt: Export the minimum number of set mask bits in sysfs

The minimum number of bits set for a cache mask is checked by the kernel
when writing a mask, but there is no way for the user to retrieve this
information.

Add a new file 'min_cbm_bits' to the info directory and export the
information to user space.
