PCI: Consolidate conditions to allow runtime PM on PCIe ports

The conditions to allow runtime PM on PCIe ports are currently spread
across two different files:  The condition relating to hotplug ports is
located in portdrv_pci.c whereas all other conditions are located in pci.c.

Consolidate all conditions in a single place in pci.c, thus making it
easier to follow the logic and amend conditions down the road.

Note that the condition relating to hotplug ports is inserted *before* the
condition relating to the "pcie_port_pm=force" command line option, so
runtime PM is not afforded to hotplug ports even if this option is given.
That's exactly how the code behaved up until now.  If this is not desired,
the ordering of the conditions can simply be reversed.

No functional change intended.
