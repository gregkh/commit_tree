i40e: restore workaround for removing default MAC filter

A previous commit 53cb6e9e8949 ("i40e: Removal of workaround for simple
MAC address filter deletion") removed a workaround for some
firmware versions which was reported to not be necessary in production
NICs. Unfortunately this workaround is necessary in some configurations,
specifically the Ethernet Controller XL710 for 40GbE QSFP+ (8086:1583).

Without this patch, the mentioned NICs with current firmware exhibit
issues when adding VLANs, as outlined by the following reproduction:

  $modprobe i40e
  $ip link set <device> up
  $ip link add link <device> vlan100 type vlan id 100
  $dmesg | tail
  <snip>
  kernel: i40e 0000:82:00.0: Error I40E_AQ_RC_EINVAL adding RX
filters on PF, promiscuous mode forced on

This results in filters being marked as FAILED and setting the device in
promiscuous mode.

The root cause of receiving the -EINVAL error response appears to be due
to a conflict with the default MAC filter which still exists on the
default firmware for this device. Attempting to add a new VLAN filter on
the default MAC address conflicts with the IGNORE_VLAN setting on the
default rule.
