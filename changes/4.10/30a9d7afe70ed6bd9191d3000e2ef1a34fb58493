ext4: fix stack memory corruption with 64k block size

The number of 'counters' elements needed in 'struct sg' is
super_block->s_blocksize_bits + 2. Presently we have 16 'counters'
elements in the array. This is insufficient for block sizes >= 32k. In
such cases the memcpy operation performed in ext4_mb_seq_groups_show()
would cause stack memory corruption.
