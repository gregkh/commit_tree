s390/zcrypt: Improved invalid domain response handling.

Add defines and switch case code to handle the two invalid
domain response codes better. Until now these two response
codes are handled via default resulting in -EAGAIN and
switching the processed queue to offline.  So this kind of
malformed request bounced through all suitable queues and
switched them off. Now this kind of malformed request is
just rejected with EINVAL without switching off the queue.
