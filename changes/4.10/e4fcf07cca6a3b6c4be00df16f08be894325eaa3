nvmet: Fix possible infinite loop triggered on hot namespace removal

When removing a namespace we delete it from the subsystem namespaces
list with list_del_init which allows us to know if it is enabled or
not.

The problem is that list_del_init initialize the list next and does
not respect the RCU list-traversal we do on the IO path for locating
a namespace. Instead we need to use list_del_rcu which is allowed to
run concurrently with the _rcu list-traversal primitives (keeps list
next intact) and guarantees concurrent nvmet_find_naespace forward
progress.

By changing that, we cannot rely on ns->dev_link for knowing if the
namspace is enabled, so add enabled indicator entry to nvmet_ns for
that.
