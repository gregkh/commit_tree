spi: rspi: supports 32bytes buffer for DUAL and QUAD

This patch supports 32bytes of buffer for DUAL and QUAD in QSPI by
Using Transmit/Receive Buffer Data Triggering Number.
In order to improve the DUAL and QUAD's performance of SPI
while transferring data in PIO mode, it sends/receives each 32bytes
data instead of each byte data as current situation.
