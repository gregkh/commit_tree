clocksource: import ARC timer driver

This adds support for

 - CONFIG_ARC_TIMERS : legacy 32-bit TIMER0 and TIMER1 which count UP
   from @CNT to @LIMIT, before optionally triggering an interrupt.
   These are programmed using ARC auxiliary register interface.
   These are present in all ARC cores (ARC700 and ARC HS38)
   TIMER0 serves as clockevent for all ARC linux builds.
   TIMER1 is used for clocksource in arc700 builds.

 - CONFIG_ARC_TIMERS_64BIT: 64-bit counters, RTC and GFRC found in
   ARC HS38 cores. These are independnet IP blocks with different
   programming model respectively.
