mm, page_alloc: fix fast-path race with cpuset update or removal

Ganapatrao Kulkarni reported that the LTP test cpuset01 in stress mode
triggers OOM killer in few seconds, despite lots of free memory.  The
test attempts to repeatedly fault in memory in one process in a cpuset,
while changing allowed nodes of the cpuset between 0 and 1 in another
process.

One possible cause is that in the fast path we find the preferred
zoneref according to current mems_allowed, so that it points to the
middle of the zonelist, skipping e.g.  zones of node 1 completely.  If
the mems_allowed is updated to contain only node 1, we never reach it in
the zonelist, and trigger OOM before checking the cpuset_mems_cookie.

This patch fixes the particular case by redoing the preferred zoneref
search if we switch back to the original nodemask.  The condition is
also slightly changed so that when the last non-root cpuset is removed,
we don't miss it.

Note that this is not a full fix, and more patches will follow.
