SMACK: Do not apply star label in smack_setprocattr hook

Smack prohibits processes from using the star ("*") and web ("@") labels.
Checks have been added in other functions. In smack_setprocattr()
hook, only check for web ("@") label has been added and restricted
from applying web ("@") label.
Check for star ("*") label should also be added in smack_setprocattr()
hook. Return error should be "-EINVAL" not "-EPERM" as permission
is there for setting label but not the label value as star ("*") or
web ("@").
