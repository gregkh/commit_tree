[media] media: ti-vpe: vpdma: Make list post atomic operation

Writing to the "VPDMA list attribute" register is considered as a list
post. This informs the VPDMA firmware to load the list from the address
which should be taken from the "VPDMA list address" register.

As these two register writes are dependent, it is important that the two
writes happen in atomic manner. This ensures multiple slices (which share
same VPDMA) can post lists asynchronously and all of them point to the
correct addresses.

Slightly modified to implementation for the original patch to use
spin_lock instead of mutex as the list post is also called from
interrupt context.
