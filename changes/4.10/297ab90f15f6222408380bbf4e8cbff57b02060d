coresight: tmc: Cleanup operation mode handling

The mode of operation of the TMC tracked in drvdata->mode is defined
as a local_t type. This is always checked and modified under the
drvdata->spinlock and hence we don't need local_t for it and the
unnecessary synchronisation instructions that comes with it. This
change makes the code a bit more cleaner.

Also fixes the order in which we update the drvdata->mode to
CS_MODE_DISABLED. i.e, in tmc_disable_etX_sink we change the
mode to CS_MODE_DISABLED before invoking tmc_disable_etX_hw()
which in turn depends on the mode to decide whether to dump the
trace to a buffer.
