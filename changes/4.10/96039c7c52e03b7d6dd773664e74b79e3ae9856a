perf sched timehist: Split is_idle_sample()

The is_idle_sample() function actually does more than determining
whether sample come from idle task.  Split the callchain part into
save_task_callchain() to make it clearer.

Also checking prev_pid from trace data looks preferred than just
checking sample->pid since it's possible, although rare, to have invalid
0 pid/tid on scheduling an exiting task.
