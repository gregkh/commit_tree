crypto: arm64/crct10dif - port x86 SSE implementation to arm64

This is a transliteration of the Intel algorithm implemented
using SSE and PCLMULQDQ instructions that resides in the file
arch/x86/crypto/crct10dif-pcl-asm_64.S, but simplified to only
operate on buffers that are 16 byte aligned (but of any size)
