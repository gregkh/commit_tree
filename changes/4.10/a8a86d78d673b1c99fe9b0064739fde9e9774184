fuse: clear FR_PENDING flag when moving requests out of pending queue

fuse_abort_conn() moves requests from pending list to a temporary list
before canceling them. This operation races with request_wait_answer()
which also tries to remove the request after it gets a fatal signal. It
checks FR_PENDING flag to determine whether the request is still in the
pending list.

Make fuse_abort_conn() clear FR_PENDING flag so that request_wait_answer()
does not remove the request from temporary list.

This bug causes an Oops when trying to delete an already deleted list entry
in end_requests().
