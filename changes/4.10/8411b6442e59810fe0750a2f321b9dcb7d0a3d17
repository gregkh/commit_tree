netfilter: nf_tables: support for set flushing

This patch adds support for set flushing, that consists of walking over
the set elements if the NFTA_SET_ELEM_LIST_ELEMENTS attribute is set.
This patch requires the following changes:

1) Add set->ops->deactivate_one() operation: This allows us to
   deactivate an element from the set element walk path, given we can
   skip the lookup that happens in ->deactivate().

2) Add a new nft_trans_alloc_gfp() function since we need to allocate
   transactions using GFP_ATOMIC given the set walk path happens with
   held rcu_read_lock.
