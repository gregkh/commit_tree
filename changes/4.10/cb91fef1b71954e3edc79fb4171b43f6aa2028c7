thermal/intel_powerclamp: Convert to CPU hotplug state

This is a conversation to the new hotplug state machine with
the difference that CPU_DEAD becomes CPU_PREDOWN.

At the same time it makes the handling of the two states symmetrical.
stop_power_clamp_worker() is called unconditionally and the controversial
error message is removed.

Finally, the hotplug state callbacks are removed after the powerclamping
is stopped to avoid a potential race.
