i2c: i801: remove SMBNTFDDAT reads as they always seem to return 0

On the platform tested, reading SMBNTFDDAT always returns 0 (using 1 read
of a word or 2 of 2 bytes). Given that we are not sure why and that we
don't need to rely on the data parameter in the current users of Host
Notify, remove this part of the code.

If someone wants to re-enable it, just revert this commit and data should
be available.
