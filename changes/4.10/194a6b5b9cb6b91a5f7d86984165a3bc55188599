sched/wake_q: Rename WAKE_Q to DEFINE_WAKE_Q

Currently the wake_q data structure is defined by the WAKE_Q() macro.
This macro, however, looks like a function doing something as "wake" is
a verb. Even checkpatch.pl was confused as it reported warnings like

  WARNING: Missing a blank line after declarations
  #548: FILE: kernel/futex.c:3665:
  +	int ret;
  +	WAKE_Q(wake_q);

This patch renames the WAKE_Q() macro to DEFINE_WAKE_Q() which clarifies
what the macro is doing and eliminates the checkpatch.pl warnings.
