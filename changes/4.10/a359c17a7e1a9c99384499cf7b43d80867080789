perf evsel: Allow to ignore missing pid

Adding perf_evsel::ignore_missing_cpu_thread bool.

When set true, it allows perf to ignore error of missing pid of perf
event syscall.

We remove missing thread id from the thread_map, so the rest of the
processing like ioctl and mmap won't get disturbed with -1 fd.

The reason for supporting this is to ease up monitoring group of pids,
that 'disappear' before perf opens their event. This currently leads
perf to report error and exit and makes perf record's -u option unusable
under certain setup.

With this change we will allow this race and ignore such failure with
following warning:

  WARNING: Ignored open failure for pid 8605
