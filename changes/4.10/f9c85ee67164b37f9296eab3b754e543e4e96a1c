[media] siano: make it work again with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK

Reported as a Kaffeine bug:
	https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=375811

The USB control messages require DMA to work. We cannot pass
a stack-allocated buffer, as it is not warranted that the
stack would be into a DMA enabled area.

On Kernel 4.9, the default is to not accept DMA on stack anymore
on x86 architecture. On other architectures, this has been a
requirement since Kernel 2.2. So, after this patch, this driver
should likely work fine on all archs.

Tested with USB ID 2040:5510: Hauppauge Windham
