radix tree test suite: free preallocated nodes

It can be a source of mild concern when the test suite shows that we're
leaking nodes.  While poring over the source code looking for leaks can
lead to some fascinating bugs being discovered, sometimes the leak is
simply that these nodes were preallocated and are sitting on the per-CPU
list.  Free them by calling the CPU dead callback.
