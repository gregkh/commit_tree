parisc: Enhance CPU detection code on PAT machines

This patch fixes the debug code which runs during the inventory scan on
machines with PAT firmware.

Additionally print out the relationship between the detected logical CPU
number and it's physical location and physical cpu number.
This leads to information which can be used to feed numa-structures in
the kernel in later patches. An example output is from my single-CPU (2
cores) C8000 machine is:

  Logical CPU #0 is physical cpu #0 at 0xffff0000ffff15, hpa 0xfffffffffe780000
  Logical CPU #1 is physical cpu #1 at 0xffff0000ffff15, hpa 0xfffffffffe781000
