lwtunnel: subtract tunnel headroom from mtu on output redirect

This patch changes the lwtunnel_headroom() function which is called
in ipv4_mtu() and ip6_mtu(), to also return the correct headroom
value when the lwtunnel state is OUTPUT_REDIRECT.

This patch enables e.g. SR-IPv6 encapsulations to work without
manually setting the route mtu.
