i40e: Fix client interaction

This patch fixes a problem in the client interface that
was causing random stack traces in RDMA driver load and
unload tests.  This patch fixes the problem by checking
for an existing client before trying to open it.  Without
this patch, there is a timing related null pointer deref.
