dax: add dax_iomap_sector() helper function

To be able to correctly calculate the sector from a file position and a
struct iomap there is a complex little bit of logic that currently happens
in both dax_iomap_actor() and dax_iomap_fault().  This will need to be
repeated yet again in the DAX PMD fault handler when it is added, so break
it out into a helper function.
