NFS: remove l_pid field from nfs_lockowner

this field is not used in any important way and probably should
have been removed by

Commit: 8003d3c4aaa5 ("nfs4: treat lock owners as opaque values")

which removed the pid argument from nfs4_get_lock_state.

Except in unusual and uninteresting cases, two threads with the same
->tgid will have the same ->files pointer, so keeping them both
for comparison brings no benefit.
