s390/zcrypt: Correct function bits for CEX2x and CEX3x cards.

For the older CEX2x and CEX3x cards the function bits returned
by TAPQ do not reflect the functions of the card. Instead the
functionality is implicit by the type of the card. The reworked
zcrypt requires to have the function bits set correct, so this
patch fixes this. The queue selection is not only based on these
function bits but also on function pointers set by the individual
drivers.
