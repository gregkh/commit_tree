lwtunnel: Add destroy state operation

Users of lwt tunnels may set up some secondary state in build_state
function. Add a corresponding destroy_state function to allow users to
clean up state. This destroy state function is called from lwstate_free.
Also, we now free lwstate using kfree_rcu so user can assume structure
is not freed before rcu.
