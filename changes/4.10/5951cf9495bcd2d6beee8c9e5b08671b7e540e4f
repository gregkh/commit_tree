i40e: use unsigned printf format specifier for active_filters count

Replace the %d specifier used for printing vsi->active_filters and
vsi->promisc_threshold with an unsigned %u format specifier. While it is
unlikely in practice that these values will ever reach such a large
number they are unsigned values and thus should not be interpreted as
negative numbers.
