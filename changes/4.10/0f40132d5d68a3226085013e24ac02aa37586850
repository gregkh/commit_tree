ASoC: es8328: Remove some unused defines

The es8328 drivers seems to have used the wm8753 driver as a template. Its
header file contains a few defines that are copied verbatim from the wm8753
header that do not really apply to this driver and are unused. So remove
those defines. This seems safe as they deal with PLL and clock divider
settings and the es8328 driver neither implements a set_pll() nor a
set_clkdiv() callback.
