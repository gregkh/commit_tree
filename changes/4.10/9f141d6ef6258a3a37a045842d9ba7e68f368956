dax: Call ->iomap_begin without entry lock during dax fault

Currently ->iomap_begin() handler is called with entry lock held. If the
filesystem held any locks between ->iomap_begin() and ->iomap_end()
(such as ext4 which will want to hold transaction open), this would cause
lock inversion with the iomap_apply() from standard IO path which first
calls ->iomap_begin() and only then calls ->actor() callback which grabs
entry locks for DAX (if it faults when copying from/to user provided
buffers).

Fix the problem by nesting grabbing of entry lock inside ->iomap_begin()
- ->iomap_end() pair.
