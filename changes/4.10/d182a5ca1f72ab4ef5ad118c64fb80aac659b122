i40e: avoid duplicate private flags definitions

Separate the global private flags and the regular private flags per
interface into two arrays. Future additions of private flags will not
need to be duplicated which may lead to buggy code. Also rename
"i40e_priv_flags_strings_gl" to "i40e_gl_priv_flags_strings" for
clarity, as it reads more naturally.
