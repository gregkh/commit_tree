ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add support for A31 analog microphone inputs

The A31 internal codec has 3 microphone outputs, of which MIC2 and MIC3
are muxed internally. The resulting two microphone inputs have separate
gain controls and mixer inputs.

The codec also has 2 microphone bias pins. HBIAS is specifically for the
headphone jack, which also supports headphone detection and control
buttons. These extra functions are not supported yet. The other, MBIAS,
is for all other analog microphones.

There is also mention of digital microphone support, but documentation
is scarce, and no hardware with it is available.
