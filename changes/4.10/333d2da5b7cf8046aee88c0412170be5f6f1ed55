drm: WARN when calling drm_format_info() for an unsupported format

The format helpers have historically treated unsupported formats as part
of the default case, returning values that are likely wrong. We can't
change this behaviour now without risking breaking drivers in difficult
to detect ways, but we can WARN on unsupported formats to catch faulty
callers.

The only exception is the framebuffer_check() function that calls
drm_format_info() to validate the format passed from userspace. This is
a valid use case that shouldn't generate a warning.
