Subject: [PATCH] af_iucv: drop skbs rejected by filter

A packet filter might be installed for instance with setsockopt
SO_ATTACH_FILTER. af_iucv currently queues skbs rejected by filter
into the backlog queue. This does not make sense, since packets
rejected by filter can be dropped immediately. This patch adds
separate sk_filter return code checking, and dropping of packets
if applicable.
