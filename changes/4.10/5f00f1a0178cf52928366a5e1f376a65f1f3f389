PCI: Add MCFG quirks for HiSilicon Hip05/06/07 host controllers

The PCIe controller in Hip05/Hip06/Hip07 SoCs is not completely
ECAM-compliant.  It is non-ECAM only for the RC bus config space; for any
other bus underneath the root bus it does support ECAM access.

Add specific quirks for PCI config space accessors.  This involves:
1. New initialization call hisi_pcie_init() to obtain RC base
addresses from PNP0C02 at the root of the ACPI namespace (under \_SB).
2. New entry in common quirk array.

[bhelgaas: move to pcie-hisi.c and change Makefile/ifdefs so quirk doesn't
depend on CONFIG_PCI_HISI]
