PCI/MSI: Don't apply affinity if there aren't enough vectors left

Bart reported a problem w—ñth an out of bounds access in the low-level IRQ
affinity code, which we root caused to the qla2xxx driver assigning all its
MSI-X vectors to the pre and post vectors, and not having any left for the
actually spread IRQs.

Fix this issue by not asking for affinity assignment when there are no
vectors to assign left.
