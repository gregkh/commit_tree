thermal/x86_pkg_temp: Remove redundant package search

In pkg_temp_thermal_device_remove() the package device is searched at the
beginning of the function. When the device refcount becomes zero another
search for the same device is conducted. Remove the pointless loop and use
the device pointer which was retrieved at the beginning of the function.
