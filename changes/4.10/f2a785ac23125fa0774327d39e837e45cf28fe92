scsi: ufshcd: Fix race between clk scaling and ungate work

The ungate work turns on the clock before it exits hibern8, if the link
was put in hibern8 during clock gating work.  There occurs a race
condition when clock scaling work calls ufshcd_hold() to make sure low
power states cannot be entered, but that returns by checking only
whether the clocks are on.  This causes the clock scaling work to issue
UIC commands when the link is in hibern8 causing failures. Make sure we
exit hibern8 state before returning from ufshcd_hold().

Callstacks for race condition:

 ufshcd_scale_gear
 ufshcd_devfreq_scale
 ufshcd_devfreq_target
 update_devfreq
 devfreq_monitor
 process_one_work
 worker_thread
 kthread
 ret_from_fork

 ufshcd_uic_hibern8_exit
 ufshcd_ungate_work
 process_one_work
 worker_thread
 kthread
 ret_from_fork
