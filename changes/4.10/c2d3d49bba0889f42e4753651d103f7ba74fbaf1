usb: xhci: move slot_id from xhci_hcd to xhci_command structure

xhci->slot_id is used for providing a way to pass slot id from the
command completion handler to the function waiting for completion.
It's shared by enumerations of all USB devices connected to an
xhci host. Hence, it's a source for possible races. Since we've
introduced command structure and the command queue to xhci driver.
It's better to move slot_id from xhci_hcd structure to xhci_command
structure. Hence the race source is removed.
