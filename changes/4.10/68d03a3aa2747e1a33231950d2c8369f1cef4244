ASoC: Intel: Skylake: remove pci device enabling calls on suspend

We were invoking pci_disable_device() while going to suspend-to-idle and
pci_enable_device() while coming back to active state.

Turns out that we do not need these calls as we only need system to be
wake capable when in suspend-to-idle state. The wake capability is
already done by enable_irq_wake() calls, so remove these unwanted calls
in driver.
