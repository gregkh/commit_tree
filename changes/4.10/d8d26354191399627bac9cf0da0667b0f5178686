ptp: Introduce a high resolution frequency adjustment method.

The internal PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) interface limits the resolution for
frequency adjustments to one part per billion.  However, some hardware
devices allow finer adjustment, and making use of the increased resolution
improves synchronization measurably on such devices.

This patch adds an alternative method that allows finer frequency tuning
by passing the scaled ppm value to PHC drivers.  This value comes from
user space, and it has a resolution of about 0.015 ppb.  We also deprecate
the older method, anticipating its removal once existing drivers have been
converted over.
