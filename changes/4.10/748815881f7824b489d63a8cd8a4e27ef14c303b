dma-buf/sw_sync: mark sync_timeline_create() static

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/dma-buf/sw_sync.c:87:23: warning: no previous prototype for 'sync_timeline_create' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, this function is only used in the file in which it is
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
So this patch marks it 'static'.
