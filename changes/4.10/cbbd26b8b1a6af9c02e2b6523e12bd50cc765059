[iov_iter] new primitives - copy_from_iter_full() and friends

copy_from_iter_full(), copy_from_iter_full_nocache() and
csum_and_copy_from_iter_full() - counterparts of copy_from_iter()
et.al., advancing iterator only in case of successful full copy
and returning whether it had been successful or not.

Convert some obvious users.  *NOTE* - do not blindly assume that
something is a good candidate for those unless you are sure that
not advancing iov_iter in failure case is the right thing in
this case.  Anything that does short read/short write kind of
stuff (or is in a loop, etc.) is unlikely to be a good one.
