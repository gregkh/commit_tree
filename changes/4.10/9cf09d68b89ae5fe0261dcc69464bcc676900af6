arm64: xen: Enable user access before a privcmd hvc call

Privcmd calls are issued by the userspace. The kernel needs to enable
access to TTBR0_EL1 as the hypervisor would issue stage 1 translations
to user memory via AT instructions. Since AT instructions are not
affected by the PAN bit (ARMv8.1), we only need the explicit
uaccess_enable/disable if the TTBR0 PAN option is enabled.
