icmp: correct return value of icmp_rcv()

Currently, icmp_rcv() always return zero on a packet delivery upcall.

To make its behavior more compliant with the way this API should be
used, this patch changes this to let it return NET_RX_SUCCESS when the
packet is proper handled, and NET_RX_DROP otherwise.
