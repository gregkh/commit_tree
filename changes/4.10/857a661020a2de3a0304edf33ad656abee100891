staging: comedi: ni_mio_common: fix E series ni_ai_insn_read() data

Commit 0557344e2149 ("staging: comedi: ni_mio_common: fix local var for
32-bit read") changed the type of local variable `d` from `unsigned
short` to `unsigned int` to fix a bug introduced in
commit 9c340ac934db ("staging: comedi: ni_stc.h: add read/write
callbacks to struct ni_private") when reading AI data for NI PCI-6110
and PCI-6111 cards.  Unfortunately, other parts of the function rely on
the variable being `unsigned short` when an offset value in local
variable `signbits` is added to `d` before writing the value to the
`data` array:

			d += signbits;
		  	data[n] = d;

The `signbits` variable will be non-zero in bipolar mode, and is used to
convert the hardware's 2's complement, 16-bit numbers to Comedi's
straight binary sample format (with 0 representing the most negative
voltage).  This breaks because `d` is now 32 bits wide instead of 16
bits wide, so after the addition of `signbits`, `data[n]` ends up being
set to values above 65536 for negative voltages.  This affects all
supported "E series" cards except PCI-6143 (and PXI-6143). Fix it by
ANDing the value written to the `data[n]` with the mask 0xffff.
