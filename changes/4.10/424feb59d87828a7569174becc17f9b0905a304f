mmc: sunxi: Prevent against null dereference for vmmc

VMMC is an optional regulator, which means that mmc_regulator_get_supply
will only return an error in case of a deferred probe, but not when the
regulator is not set in the DT.

However, the sunxi driver assumes that VMMC is always there, and doesn't
check the value of the regulator pointer before using it, which obviously
leads to a (close to) null pointer dereference.

Add proper checks to prevent that.
