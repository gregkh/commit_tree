drm/i915/skl+: Remove data_rate from watermark struct, v2.

It's only used in one function, and can be calculated without caching it
in the global struct by using drm_atomic_crtc_state_for_each_plane_state.

There are loops over all planes, including planes that don't exist.
This is harmless, because data_rate will always be 0 for them and we
never program them when updating watermarks.

Changes since v1:
- Rename rate back to data_rate, and change array name to
  plane_data_rate. (Matt)
- Remove whitespace. (Paulo)
