    drm/i915: Split insertion/binding of an object into the VM

It is useful to have this trace as it pairs nicely with the vma_unbind
one to track vma activity.
Added inside the i915_vma_bind function (was outside before) to keep a
similar placement as trace_i915_vma_unbind.

v2: print bind_flags instead of flags (Chris)
