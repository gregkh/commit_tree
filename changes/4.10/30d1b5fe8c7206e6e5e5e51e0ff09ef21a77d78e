drm/i915/gen9: don't call ilk_pipe_pixel_rate() twice on the same function

We used to call skl_pipe_pixel_rate(), which used to be a single
one-line return, but now we're  calling ilk_pipe_pixel_rate() which is
not as simple, so it's better to just call it once and store the
computed value for reuse.
