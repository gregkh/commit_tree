fs: Provide function to unmap metadata for a range of blocks

Provide function equivalent to unmap_underlying_metadata() for a range
of blocks. We somewhat optimize the function to use pagevec lookups
instead of looking up buffer heads one by one and use page lock to pin
buffer heads instead of mapping's private_lock to improve scalability.
