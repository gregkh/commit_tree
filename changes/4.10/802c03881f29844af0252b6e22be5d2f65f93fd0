sysrq: attach sysrq handler correctly for 32-bit kernel

The sysrq input handler should be attached to the input device which has
a left alt key.

On 32-bit kernels, some input devices which has a left alt key cannot
attach sysrq handler.  Because the keybit bitmap in struct input_device_id
for sysrq is not correctly initialized.  KEY_LEFTALT is 56 which is
greater than BITS_PER_LONG on 32-bit kernels.

I found this problem when using a matrix keypad device which defines
a KEY_LEFTALT (56) but doesn't have a KEY_O (24 == 56%32).
