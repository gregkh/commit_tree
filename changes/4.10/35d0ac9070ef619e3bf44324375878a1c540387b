netfilter: nf_tables: fix set->nelems counting with no NLM_F_EXCL

If the element exists and no NLM_F_EXCL is specified, do not bump
set->nelems, otherwise we leak one set element slot. This problem
amplifies if the set is full since the abort path always decrements the
counter for the -ENFILE case too, giving one spare extra slot.

Fix this by moving set->nelems update to nft_add_set_elem() after
successful element insertion. Moreover, remove the element if the set is
full so there is no need to rely on the abort path to undo things
anymore.
