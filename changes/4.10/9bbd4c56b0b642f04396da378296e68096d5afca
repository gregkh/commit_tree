arm64: prep stack walkers for THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK

When CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is selected, task stacks may be freed
before a task is destroyed. To account for this, the stacks are
refcounted, and when manipulating the stack of another task, it is
necessary to get/put the stack to ensure it isn't freed and/or re-used
while we do so.

This patch reworks the arm64 stack walking code to account for this.
When CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is not selected these perform no
refcounting, and this should only be a structural change that does not
affect behaviour.
