staging: vc04_services: Convert pointers in shared state to offsets

The arm processor core and the GPU have a shared data structure.
This structure contains pointers to base linux kernel objects such as
events.  The size of the pointer changes between 32 bit and 64 bit,
so it is necessary to convert these pointers to offsets from the
beginning of the state structure.

Luckly, the GPU does not interpret these pointers/offsets,
but this change is necessary to keep the structure the same since
the GPU code is outside the scope of the linux kernel
and can't be easily changed.
