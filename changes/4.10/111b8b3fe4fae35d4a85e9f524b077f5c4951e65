cpufreq: intel_pstate: Always keep all limits settings in sync

Make intel_pstate update per-logical-CPU limits when the global
settings are changed to ensure that they are always in sync and
users will not see confusing values in per-logical-CPU sysfs
attributes.

This also fixes the problem that setting the "no_turbo" global
attribute to 1 in the "passive" mode (ie. when intel_pstate acts
as a regular cpufreq driver) when scaling_governor is set to
"performance" has no effect.
