ASoC: ab8500: Remove explicit initialization of driver callbacks to NULL

Fields of structs with global storage are implicitly initialized to 0/NULL,
there is usually no need to do this explicitly.

Removing the initialization of the legacy suspend/resume callback fields
also gets the driver ready for the day when they are eventually removed.
