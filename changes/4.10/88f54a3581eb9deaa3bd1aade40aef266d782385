powerpc/iommu: Pass mm_struct to init/cleanup helpers

We are going to get rid of @current references in mmu_context_boos3s64.c
and cache mm_struct in the VFIO container. Since mm_context_t does not
have reference counting, we will be using mm_struct which does have
the reference counter.

This changes mm_iommu_init/mm_iommu_cleanup to receive mm_struct rather
than mm_context_t (which is embedded into mm).

This should not cause any behavioral change.
