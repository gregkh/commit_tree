sctp: sctp_transport_lookup_process should rcu_read_unlock when transport is null

Prior to this patch, sctp_transport_lookup_process didn't rcu_read_unlock
when it failed to find a transport by sctp_addrs_lookup_transport.

This patch is to fix it by moving up rcu_read_unlock right before checking
transport and also to remove the out path.
