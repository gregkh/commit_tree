remoteproc: adsp-pil: fix recursive dependency

The newly added driver tries to 'select' a symbol that it has an
implicit dependency on, which confuses Kconfig:

subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
drivers/remoteproc/Kconfig:3:	symbol REMOTEPROC is selected by QCOM_ADSP_PIL

As REMOTEPROC is itself user-visible, we clearly should not select
it from a driver, removing the line fixes the problem.
