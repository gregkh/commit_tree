net: remove MTU limits on a few ether_setup callers

These few drivers call ether_setup(), but have no ndo_change_mtu, and thus
were overlooked for changes to MTU range checking behavior. They
previously had no range checks, so for feature-parity, set their min_mtu
to 0 and max_mtu to ETH_MAX_MTU (65535), instead of the 68 and 1500
inherited from the ether_setup() changes. Fine-tuning can come after we get
back to full feature-parity here.
