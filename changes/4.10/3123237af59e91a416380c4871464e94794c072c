i40e: Add support for 25G devices

Add support for 25G devices - defines and data structures.

One tricky part here is that the firmware support for these
Devices introduces a mismatch between the PHY type enum and
the bitfields for the phy types.

This change creates a macro and uses it to increment the 25G
PHY values when creating 25G bitfields.
