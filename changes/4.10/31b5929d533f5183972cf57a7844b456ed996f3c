vt: fix Scroll Lock LED trigger name

There is a disagreement between drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c and
drivers/input/input-leds.c with regard to what is a Scroll Lock LED
trigger name: input calls it "kbd-scrolllock", but vt calls it
"kbd-scrollock" (two l's).
This prevents Scroll Lock LED trigger from binding to this LED by default.

Since it is a scroLL Lock LED, this interface was introduced only about a
year ago and in an Internet search people seem to reference this trigger
only to set it to this LED let's simply rename it to "kbd-scrolllock".

Also, it looks like this was supposed to be changed before this code was
merged: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/6/9/697 but it was done only on
the input side.
