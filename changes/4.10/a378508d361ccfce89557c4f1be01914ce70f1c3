phy: qcom-ufs-qmp-xx: Discard remove callback for drivers.

remove() callback does a phy_power_off() only over the phy,
and nothing else now.
The phy_power_off() over the generic phy is called from the phy
consumer, and phy provider driver should not explicitly need to
call any phy ops.
So discard the remove callback for qcom-ufs phy platform drivers.
