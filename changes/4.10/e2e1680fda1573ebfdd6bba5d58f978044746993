perf bench futex: Avoid worker cacheline bouncing

Sebastian noted that overhead for worker thread ops (throughput)
accounting was producing 'perf' to appear in the profiles, consuming a
non-trivial (i.e. 13%) amount of CPU.

This is due to cacheline bouncing due to the increment of w->ops.

We can easily fix this by just working on a local copy and updating the
actual worker once done running, and ready to show the program summary.
There is no danger of the worker being concurrent, so we can trust that
no stale value is being seen by another thread.

This also gets rid of the unnecessary cache alignment hack; its not
worth it.
