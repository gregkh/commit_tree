shmem: avoid maybe-uninitialized warning

After enabling -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings, we get a false-postive
warning for shmem:

  mm/shmem.c: In function `shmem_getpage_gfp':
  include/linux/spinlock.h:332:21: error: `info' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This can be easily avoided, since the correct 'info' pointer is known at
the time we first enter the function, so we can simply move the
initialization up.  Moving it before the first label avoids the warning
and lets us remove two later initializations.

Note that the function is so hard to read that it not only confuses the
compiler, but also most readers and without this patch it could\ easily
break if one of the 'goto's changed.
