iommu/exynos: Rework and fix internal locking

This patch reworks locking in the exynos_iommu_attach/detach_device
functions to ensure that all entries of the sysmmu_drvdata and
exynos_iommu_owner structure are updated under the respective spinlocks,
while runtime pm functions are called without any spinlocks held.
