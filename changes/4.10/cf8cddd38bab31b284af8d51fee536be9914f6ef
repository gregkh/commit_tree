btrfs: don't abuse REQ_OP_* flags for btrfs_map_block

btrfs_map_block supports different types of mappings, which to a large
extent resemble block layer operations.  But they don't always do, and
currently btrfs dangerously overlays it's own flag over the block layer
flags.  This is just asking for a conflict, so introduce a different
map flags enum inside of btrfs instead.
