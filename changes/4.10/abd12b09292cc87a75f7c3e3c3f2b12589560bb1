scsi: atari_scsi: Make device register accessors re-entrant

This patch fixes an old bug: accesses to device registers from the
interrupt handler (after reselection, DMA completion etc.) could mess
up a device register access elsewhere, if the latter takes place outside
of an irq lock (during selection etc.).
