[media] ite-cir: initialize use_demodulator before using it

Function ite_set_carrier_params() uses variable use_demodulator after
having initialized it to false in some if branches, but this variable is
never set to true otherwise.

This bug has been found using clang -Wsometimes-uninitialized warning
flag.

several ITE CIRs")
