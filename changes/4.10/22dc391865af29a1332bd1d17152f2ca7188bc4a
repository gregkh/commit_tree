x86/boot: Fix the end of the stack for idle tasks

Thanks to all the recent x86 entry code refactoring, most tasks' kernel
stacks start at the same offset right below their saved pt_regs,
regardless of which syscall was used to enter the kernel.  That creates
a nice convention which makes it straightforward to identify the end of
the stack, which can be useful for the unwinder to verify the stack is
sane.

However, the boot CPU's idle "swapper" task doesn't follow that
convention.  Fix that by starting its stack at a sizeof(pt_regs) offset
from the end of the stack page.
