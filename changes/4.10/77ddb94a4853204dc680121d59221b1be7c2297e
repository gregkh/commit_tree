scsi: qla2xxx: Only allow operational MBX to proceed during RESET.

This patch is allowing only ROM mailbox command which are
necessary to initialize chip after a reset has been issued.
In a target environment, there could be a user space daemon
which can issue statistics and other management mailbox command
which are non-critical. This patch will timeout non critical
mailbox commands immediately rather than waiting for timeout,
if driver detects that chip reset has been issued or chip reset
is in progress.
