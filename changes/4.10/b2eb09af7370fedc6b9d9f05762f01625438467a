net: stmmac: Fix error path after register_netdev move

Commit 5701659004d6 ("net: stmmac: Fix race between stmmac_drv_probe and
stmmac_open") re-ordered how the MDIO bus registration and the network
device are registered, but missed to unwind the MDIO bus registration in
case we fail to register the network device.
