drm/i915: Make sure engines are idle during GPU idling in LR mode

We assume that the GPU is idle once receiving the seqno via the last
request's user interrupt. In execlist mode the corresponding context
completed interrupt can be delayed though and until this latter
interrupt arrives we consider the request to be pending on the ELSP
submit port. This can cause a problem during system suspend where this
last request will be seen by the resume code as still pending. Such
pending requests are normally replayed after a GPU reset, but during
resume we reset both SW and HW tracking of the ring head/tail pointers,
so replaying the pending request with its stale tail pointer will leave
the ring in an inconsistent state. A subsequent request submission can
lead then to the GPU executing from uninitialized area in the ring
behind the above stale tail pointer.

Fix this by making sure any pending request on the ELSP port is
completed before suspending. I used a polling wait since the completion
time I measured was <1ms and since normally we only need to wait during
system suspend. GPU idling during runtime suspend is scheduled with a
delay (currently 50-100ms) after the retirement of the last request at
which point the context completed interrupt must have arrived already.

The chance of this bug was increased by

    drm/i915/hsw: Fix GPU hang during resume from S3-devices state

but it could happen even without the explicit GPU reset, since we
disable interrupts afterwards during the suspend sequence.

v2:
- Do an unlocked poll-wait first. (Chris)
v3-4:
- s/intel_lr_engines_idle/intel_execlists_idle/ and move
  i915.enable_execlists check to the new helper. (Chris)
