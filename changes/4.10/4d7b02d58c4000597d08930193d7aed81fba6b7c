x86/mcheck: Split threshold_cpu_callback into two callbacks

The threshold_cpu_callback callbacks looks like one of the notifier and
its arguments are almost the same. Split this out and have one ONLINE
and one DEAD callback. This will come handy later once the main code
gets changed to use the callback mechanism.
Also, handle threshold_cpu_callback_online() return value so we don't
continue if the function fails.

Boris Petkov removed the callback pointer and replaced it with proper
functions.
