s390/ptrace: Preserve previous registers for short regset write

Ensure that if userspace supplies insufficient data to
PTRACE_SETREGSET to fill all the registers, the thread's old
registers are preserved.

convert_vx_to_fp() is adapted to handle only a specified number of
registers rather than unconditionally handling all of them: other
callers of this function are adapted appropriately.

Based on an initial patch by Dave Martin.
