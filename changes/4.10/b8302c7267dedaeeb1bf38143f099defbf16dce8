clk: sunxi-ng: Finish to convert to structures for arguments

Some clocks still use an explicit list of arguments, which make it a bit
more tedious to add new parameters.

Convert those over to a structure pointer argument to add as many
arguments as possible without having to many noise in our patches, or a
very long list of arguments.
