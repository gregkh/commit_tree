locking/core, stop_machine: Yield the CPU during stop machine()

Some time ago the following commit:

  57f2ffe14fd125c2 ("s390: remove diag 44 calls from cpu_relax()")

... stopped cpu_relax() on s390 yielding to the hypervisor.

As it turns out this made stop_machine() run really slow on virtualized
overcommited systems. For example the kprobes test during bootup took
several seconds instead of just running unnoticed with large guests.

Therefore, yielding was reintroduced with commit:

  4d92f50249eb ("s390: reintroduce diag 44 calls for cpu_relax()")

... but in fact the stop machine code seems to be the only place where
this yielding was really necessary. This place is probably the most
important one as it makes all but one guest CPUs wait for one guest CPU.

As we now have cpu_relax_yield(), we can use this in multi_cpu_stop().
For now lets only add it here. We can add it later in other places
when necessary.
