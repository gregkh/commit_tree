drm/amdgpu: add AMDGPU_GEM_CREATE_VRAM_CONTIGUOUS flag v3

Add a flag noting that a BO must be created using linear VRAM
and set this flag on all in kernel users where appropriate.

Hopefully I haven't missed anything.

v2: add it in a few more places, fix CPU mapping.
v3: rename to VRAM_CONTIGUOUS, fix typo in CS code.
