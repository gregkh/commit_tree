doc-rst: Revert "kernel-doc: fix handling of address_space tags"

This reverts commit a88b1672d4ddf9895eb53e6980926d5e960dea8e.

From the origin comit log::

  The RST cpp:function handler is very pedantic: it doesn't allow any
  macros like __user on it

Since the kernel-doc parser does NOT make use of the cpp:domain, there
is no need to change the kernel-doc parser eleminating the address_space
tags.
