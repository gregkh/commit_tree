drm/i915: Remove obsolete engine->gpu_caches_dirty

Space for flushing the GPU cache prior to completing the request is
preallocated and so cannot fail - the GPU caches will always be flushed
along with the completed request. This means we no longer have to track
whether the GPU cache is dirty between batches like we had to with the
outstanding_lazy_seqno.

With the removal of the duplication in the per-backend entry points for
emitting the obsolete lazy flush, we can then further unify the
engine->emit_flush.

v2: Expand a bit on the legacy of gpu_caches_dirty
