greybus: loopback: rename frequency to requests

The name frequency does not adequately describe the data-point tracking the
number of greybus operations performed in a second by the loopback code.
Firmware team is moving towards calling this variable requests-per-second
or similar. This patch renames to keep the namespace consistent.
