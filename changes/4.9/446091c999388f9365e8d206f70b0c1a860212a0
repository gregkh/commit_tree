greybus: camera: Add CSI configuration parameters

Add CSI configuration parameters to the configure_stream operation
response.
Currently, only the total number of lines in a second is used to configure the
the AP-Bridge CSI transmitter, all other parameters (number of CSI data
lanes, and CSI bus clock frequency) are kept hard-coded for two reasons:
1) We need to configure the CSI receiver on AP side accordingly to these
settings, before sending them to APB1 CSI transmitter.
2) We cannot use the camera module provided parameters as-is, but use
those information to compute the required bandwidth on the CSI bus, and
configure the # of CSI data lanes, and the CSI bus clock speed in a way that
satisfies that bandwidth requirement.
