extcon: Add the support for extcon property according to extcon type

This patch support the extcon property for the external connector
because each external connector might have the property according to
the H/W design and the specific characteristics.

- EXTCON_PROP_USB_[property name]
- EXTCON_PROP_CHG_[property name]
- EXTCON_PROP_JACK_[property name]
- EXTCON_PROP_DISP_[property name]

Add the new extcon APIs to get/set the property value as following:
- int extcon_get_property(struct extcon_dev *edev, unsigned int id,
			unsigned int prop,
			union extcon_property_value *prop_val)
- int extcon_set_property(struct extcon_dev *edev, unsigned int id,
			unsigned int prop,
			union extcon_property_value prop_val)
