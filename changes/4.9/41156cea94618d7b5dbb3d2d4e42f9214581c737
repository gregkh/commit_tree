net: ethernet: mediatek: enhance RX path by aggregating more SKBs into NAPI

The patch adds support for aggregating more SKBs feed into NAPI in
order to get more benefits from generic receive offload (GRO) by
peeking at the RX ring status and moving more packets right before
returning from NAPI RX polling handler if NAPI budgets are still
available and some packets already present in hardware.
