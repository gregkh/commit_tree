ARM: dts: rockchip: add missing regulators for firefly reload board

There are many regulators are missed in previous commit, this
commit complete most of them. It also fix some mistakes in the
regulator properties. The VDD_10(REG10) and VCC_18(REG11) had better
to keep in always-on state, as it is used as the USB PHY supply,
corretly we have no way to assign power supply to a USB PHY.
The VCCA_33(REG8) should be enabled or the GMAC won't work.

It also fix the wrong properties for audio in io-domains, the supply
connected to APIO4_VDD is different to firefly release version.
