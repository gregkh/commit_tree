NFS: Fix inode corruption in nfs_prime_dcache()

Due to inode number reuse in filesystems, we can end up corrupting the
inode on our client if we apply the file attributes without ensuring that
the filehandle matches.
Typical symptoms include spurious "mode changed" reports in the syslog.

We still do want to ensure that we don't invalidate the dentry if the
inode number matches, but we don't have a filehandle.
