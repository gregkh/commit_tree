netfilter: nft_queue: check the validation of queues_total and queuenum

Although the validation of queues_total and queuenum is checked in nft
utility, but user can add nft rules via nfnetlink, so it is necessary
to check the validation at the nft_queue expr init routine too.

Tested by run ./nft-test.py any/queue.t:
  any/queue.t: 6 unit tests, 0 error, 0 warning
