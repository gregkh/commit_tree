ARM: kernel: merge core and init PLTs

The PLT code uses a separate .init.plt section to allocate PLT entries
for jump and call instructions in __init code. However, even for fairly
sizable modules like mac80211.ko, we only end up with a couple of PLT
entries in the .init section, and so we can simplify the code
significantly by emitting all PLT entries into the same section.
