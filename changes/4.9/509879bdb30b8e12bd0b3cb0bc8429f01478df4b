Drivers: hv: Introduce a policy for controlling channel affinity

Introduce a mechanism to control how channels will be affinitized. We will
support two policies:

1. HV_BALANCED: All performance critical channels will be dstributed
evenly amongst all the available NUMA nodes. Once the Node is assigned,
we will assign the CPU based on a simple round robin scheme.

2. HV_LOCALIZED: Only the primary channels are distributed across all
NUMA nodes. Sub-channels will be in the same NUMA node as the primary
channel. This is the current behaviour.

The default policy will be the HV_BALANCED as it can minimize the remote
memory access on NUMA machines with applications that span NUMA nodes.
