dmaengine: s3c24xx: Add dma_slave_map for s3c2440 devices

This patch updates the s3c24xx dma driver to be able to pass a
dma_slave_map array via the platform data. This is needed to
be able to use the new, simpler dmaengine API [1].
I used the virtual DMA channels as a parameter for the dma_filter
function. By doing that, I could reuse the existing filter function in
drivers/dma/s3c24xx-dma.c.

I have tested this on my mini2440 board with the audio driver.
According to my observations, dma_request_slave_channel in the
function dmaengine_pcm_new in the file
sound/soc/soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm.c now returns a valid DMA channel
whereas before no DMA channel was returned at that point.

Entries for DMACH_XD0, DMACH_XD1 and DMACH_TIMER are missing because I
don't realy know which driver to use for these.
