ARM: mv78xx0: simplify ethernet device creation

Out of the four ethernet devices on mv78xx0, only the first one
has an error interrupt line, for the other ones we pass NO_IRQ
and then ignore the argument.

In order to get closer to complete remove of NO_IRQ, this simply
drops the unused function arguments.
