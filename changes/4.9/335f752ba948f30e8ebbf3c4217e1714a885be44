drm/i915/dp: Restore PPS HW state from the encoder resume hook

Similarly to the previous patch, initialize the PPS from the DP
encoder's resume hook. Note that as opposed to LVDS we can't do this
during encoder enabling, since we need the PPS for DP detection as well.
The PPS init code is now the same for init and resume, so factor out a
new intel_dp_pps_init() helper for this.

v2:
- Factor out intel_dp_pps_init() (Ville).
