serial: samsung: Register cpufreq notifier only on S3C24xx

The Samsung serial driver registered for CPU frequency transitions to
recalculate its clock when ARM clock frequency changes.  This is needed
only on S3C24xx platform so limit the ifdef to respective cpufreq
driver.

On S3C24xx the ratio ratio between frequencies of UART's parent clock
(pclk) and ARM's parent clock (fclk) remains fixed.  Therefore when ARM
clock frequency goes down, the serial is also affected.
