ipv6: report NLM_F_CREATE and NLM_F_EXCL flags in RTM_NEWROUTE events

Since commit 37a1d3611c12 ("ipv6: include NLM_F_REPLACE in route
replace notifications"), RTM_NEWROUTE notifications have their
NLM_F_REPLACE flag set if the new route replaced a preexisting one.
However, other flags aren't set.

This patch reports the missing NLM_F_CREATE and NLM_F_EXCL flag bits.

NLM_F_APPEND is not reported, because in ipv6 a NLM_F_CREATE request
is interpreted as an append request (contrary to ipv4, "prepend" is not
supported, so if NLM_F_EXCL is not set then NLM_F_APPEND is implicit).

As a result, the possible flag combination can now be reported
(iproute2's terminology into parentheses):

  * NLM_F_CREATE | NLM_F_EXCL: route didn't exist, exclusive creation
    ("add").
  * NLM_F_CREATE: route did already exist, new route added after
    preexisting ones ("append").
  * NLM_F_REPLACE: route did already exist, new route replaced the
    first preexisting one ("change").
