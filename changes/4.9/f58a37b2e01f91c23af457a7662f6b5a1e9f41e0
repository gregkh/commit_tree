efi/esrt: Use memremap not ioremap to access ESRT table in memory

On ARM and arm64, ioremap() and memremap() are not interchangeable like
on x86, and the use of ioremap() on ordinary RAM is typically flagged
as an error if the memory region being mapped is also covered by the
linear mapping, since that would lead to aliases with conflicting
cacheability attributes.

Since what we are dealing with is not an I/O region with side effects,
using ioremap() here is arguably incorrect anyway, so let's replace
it with memremap() instead.
