netfilter: nft_log: complete NFTA_LOG_FLAGS attr support

NFTA_LOG_FLAGS attribute is already supported, but the related
NF_LOG_XXX flags are not exposed to the userspace. So we cannot
explicitly enable log flags to log uid, tcp sequence, ip options
and so on, i.e. such rule "nft add rule filter output log uid"
is not supported yet.

So move NF_LOG_XXX macro definitions to the uapi/../nf_log.h. In
order to keep consistent with other modules, change NF_LOG_MASK to
refer to all supported log flags. On the other hand, add a new
NF_LOG_DEFAULT_MASK to refer to the original default log flags.

Finally, if user specify the unsupported log flags or NFTA_LOG_GROUP
and NFTA_LOG_FLAGS are set at the same time, report EINVAL to the
userspace.
