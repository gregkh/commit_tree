drm/i915/evict: Always switch away from the current context

Currently execlists is exempt from emitting a request to switch each
ring away from the current context over to the dev_priv->kernel_context
(for whatever reason, just under execlists the GGTT is unlikely to be as
fragmented, however the switch may help in some extreme cases). Extract
the switcher and enable it for execlsts as well, as we need to do so in
a later patch to force the context switch before suspend. (And since for
that switch we explicitly require the disposable kernel context, rename
the extracted function.)
