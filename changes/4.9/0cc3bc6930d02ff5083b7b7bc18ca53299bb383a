greybus: timesync: Fix transitions to the INACTIVE state

Analysing a backtrace associated with the current EHCI runtime suspend code
has highlighted several places where its perfectly valid to make a
transition to GB_TIMESYNC_STATE_INACTIVE when not already in the
GB_TIMESYNC_STATE_INIT state, for example failure to issue a TimeSync
enable command to the SVC can and should legitimately call
gb_timesync_teardown() - at this point the state will be
GB_TIMESYNC_STATE_WAIT_SVC and it's legitimate and desirable to transition
to the INACTIVE state in this case. This patch fixes by removing the
restrictive and incorrect restriction on the transition to INACTIVE only
being valid when state == GB_TIMESYNC_STATE_INIT.
