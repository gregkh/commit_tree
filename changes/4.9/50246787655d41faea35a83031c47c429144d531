powerpc/pasemi: Fix Nemo SB600 i8259 interrupts.

The device tree on the Nemo passes all of the i8259 interrupts with
numbers between 212 and 222, and points their interrupt-parent property
to the pasemi-opic, requiring custom patches to the kernel. Fix the
values so that they can be controlled by the generic ppc i8259 code.
