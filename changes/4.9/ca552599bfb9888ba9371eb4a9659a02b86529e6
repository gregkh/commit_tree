autofs: use autofs4_free_ino() to kfree dentry data

kfree dentry data allocated by autofs4_new_ino() with autofs4_free_ino()
instead of raw kfree.  (since we have the interface to free autofs_info*)

This patch was modified to remove the need to set the dentry info field to
NULL dew to a change in the previous patch.
