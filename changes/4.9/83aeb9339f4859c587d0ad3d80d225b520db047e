qed*: Trivial modifications

Change qed* code in trivial manner; This isn't necessarily
semantic-only, but the end result is the same, i.e., no change
should occur from user perspective. Changes include:
  - Using temporary variables to better fit 80-character restrictions.
  - Removal of unused variables & code with no effect.
[plus some additional minor modifications].
