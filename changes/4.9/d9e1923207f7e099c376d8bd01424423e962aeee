autofs: add autofs_dev_ioctl_version() for AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_VERSION_CMD

No functional changes, based on the following justification.

1. Make the code more consistent using the ioctl vector _ioctls[],
   rather than assigning NULL only for this ioctl command.
2. Remove goto done; for better maintainability in the long run.
3. The existing code is based on the fact that validate_dev_ioctl()
   sets ioctl version for any command, but AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_VERSION_CMD
   should explicitly set it regardless of the default behavior.
