HID: hid-logitech: Rewrite of descriptor for all DF wheels

Rewrite the HID descriptor for _all_ Driving Force wheels (real
or emulated) so that they can report separate Accelerator and
Brake axis.

If the user wants a combined accel/brake axis, they can use the
'combined pedals' feature.

$ echo 1 > /sys/bus/hid/devices/<device-id>/combine_pedals
