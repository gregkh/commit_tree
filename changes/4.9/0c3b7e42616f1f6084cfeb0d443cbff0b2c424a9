tools build: Add support for host programs format

In some cases, like for fixdep and shortly for jevents, we need to build a tool
to run on the host that will be used in building a tool, such as perf, that is
being cross compiled, so do like the kernel and provide HOSTCC, HOSTLD and HOSTAR
to do that.
