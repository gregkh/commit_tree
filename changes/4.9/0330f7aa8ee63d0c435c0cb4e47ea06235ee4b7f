tracing: Have hwlat trace migrate across tracing_cpumask CPUs

Instead of having the hwlat detector thread stay on one CPU, have it migrate
across all the CPUs specified by tracing_cpumask. If the user modifies the
thread's CPU affinity, the migration will stop until the next instance that
the tracer is instantiated. The migration happens at the end of each window
(period).
