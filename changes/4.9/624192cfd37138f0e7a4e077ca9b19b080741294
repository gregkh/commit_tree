drm/i915: Add convenience wrappers for vma's object get/put

The VMA are unreferenced, they belong to the object and live until they
are closed. However, if we want to use the VMA as a cookie and use it to
keep the object alive, we want to hold onto a reference to the object
for the lifetime of the VMA cookie. To facilitate this, add a couple of
simple wrappers for managing the reference count on the object owning the
VMA.
