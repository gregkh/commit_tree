ARM: 8603/1: V7M: Add addresses for mem-mapped V7M cache operations

V7M implements cache operations similarly to V7A/R, however all operations
are performed via memory-mapped IO instead of co-processor operations.

This patch adds register definitions relevant to the V7M ARM architecture's
cache architecture.
