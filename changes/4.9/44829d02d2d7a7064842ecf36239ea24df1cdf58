xprtrdma: Support larger inline thresholds

The Version One default inline threshold is still 1KB. But allow
testing with thresholds up to 64KB.

This maximum is somewhat arbitrary. There's no fundamental
architectural limit I'm aware of, but it's good to keep the size of
Receive buffers reasonable. Now that Send can use a s/g list, a
Send buffer is only as large as each RPC requires. Receive buffers
are always the size of the inline threshold, however.
