drm/i915/cmdparser: Only cache the dst vmap

For simplicity, we want to continue using a contiguous mapping of the
command buffer, but we can reduce the number of vmappings we hold by
switching over to a page-by-page copy from the user batch buffer to the
shadow. The cost for saving one linear mapping is about 5% in trivial
workloads - which is more or less the overhead in calling kmap_atomic().
