ipv4: allow local fragmentation in ip_finish_output_gso()

Some configurations (e.g. geneve interface with default
MTU of 1500 over an ethernet interface with 1500 MTU) result
in the transmission of packets that exceed the configured MTU.
While this should be considered to be a "bad" configuration,
it is still allowed and should not result in the sending
of packets that exceed the configured MTU.

Fix by dropping the assumption in ip_finish_output_gso() that
locally originated gso packets will never need fragmentation.
Basic testing using iperf (observing CPU usage and bandwidth)
have shown no measurable performance impact for traffic not
requiring fragmentation.
