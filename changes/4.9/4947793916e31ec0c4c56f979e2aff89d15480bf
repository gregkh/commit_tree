PCI: pciehp: Remove unnecessary guard

In pcie_isr(), we return early if no status bits other than
PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_CC are set.  This was introduced by dbd79aed1aea ("pciehp:
fix NULL dereference in interrupt handler"), but it is no longer necessary
because all the subsequent pcie_isr() code is already predicated on a
status bit being set.

Remove the unnecessary test for ~PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_CC.  No functional change
intended.
