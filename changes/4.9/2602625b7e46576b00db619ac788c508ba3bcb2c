security, overlayfs: Provide hook to correctly label newly created files

During a new file creation we need to make sure new file is created with the
right label. New file is created in upper/ so effectively file should get
label as if task had created file in upper/.

We switched to mounter's creds for actual file creation. Also if there is a
whiteout present, then file will be created in work/ dir first and then
renamed in upper. In none of the cases file will be labeled as we want it to
be.

This patch introduces a new hook dentry_create_files_as(), which determines
the label/context dentry will get if it had been created by task in upper
and modify passed set of creds appropriately. Caller makes use of these new
creds for file creation.
