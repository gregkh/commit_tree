powerpc: Use kprobe blacklist for exception handlers

Currently we mark the C implementations of some exception handlers as
__kprobes. This has the effect of putting them in the ".kprobes.text"
section, which separates them from the rest of the text.

Instead we can use the blacklist macros to add the symbols to a
blacklist which kprobes will check. This allows the linker to move
exception handler functions close to callers and avoids trampolines in
larger kernels.
