arm64: dts: rockchip: change all interrupts cells to 4 on rk3399 SoCs

Add the interrupts cells value for 4, and the 4th cell is zero.

Due to the doc[0] said:" the system requires describing PPI affinity,
then the value must be at least 4"
The 4th cell is a phandle to a node describing a set of CPUs this
interrupt is affine to. The interrupt must be a PPI, and the node
pointed must be a subnode of the "ppi-partitions" subnode. For
interrupt types other than PPI or PPIs that are not partitionned,
this cell must be zero. See the "ppi-partitions" node description
below.
