xfs: log recovery tracepoints to track current lsn and buffer submission

Log recovery has particular rules around buffer submission along with
tricky corner cases where independent transactions can share an LSN. As
such, it can be difficult to follow when/why buffers are submitted
during recovery.

Add a couple tracepoints to post the current LSN of a record when a new
record is being processed and when a buffer is being skipped due to LSN
ordering. Also, update the recover item class to include the LSN of the
current transaction for the item being processed.
