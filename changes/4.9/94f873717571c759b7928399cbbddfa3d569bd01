fs/cifs: keep guid when assigning fid to fileinfo

When we open a durable handle we give a Globally Unique
Identifier (GUID) to the server which we must keep for later reference
e.g. when reopening persistent handles on reconnection.

Without this the GUID generated for a new persistent handle was lost and
16 zero bytes were used instead on re-opening.
