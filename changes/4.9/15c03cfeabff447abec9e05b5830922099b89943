const_structs.checkpatch: add frequently used from Julia Lawall's list

Using const is generally a good idea.

Julia Lawall has created a list of always const and almost always const
structs in the kernel sources.

Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/28/95

Add the most frequently used (> 50 cases) that are almost always or
always const.
