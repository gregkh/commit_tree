net/mlx4_core: Fix the resource-type enum in res tracker to conform to FW spec

The resource type enum in the resource tracker was incorrect.
RES_EQ was put in the position of RES_NPORT_ID (a FC resource).

Since the remaining resources maintain their current values,
and RES_EQ is not passed from slaves to the hypervisor in any
FW command, this change affects only the hypervisor.
Therefore, there is no backwards-compatibility issue.
