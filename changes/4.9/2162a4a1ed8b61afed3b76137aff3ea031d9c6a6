net: hns: bug fix about broadcast/multicast packets

When the dsaf mode receives a broadcast packet, it will filter
the packet by comparing the received queue number and destination
queue number(get from forwarding table), if they are the same,
the packet will be filtered. Otherwise, the packet will be loopback.
So this patch select queue 0 to send broadcast and multicast packets.
