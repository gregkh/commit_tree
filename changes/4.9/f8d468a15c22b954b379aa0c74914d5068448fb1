Btrfs: fix mount -o clear_cache,space_cache=v2

We moved the code for creating the free space tree the first time that
it's enabled, but didn't move the clearing code along with it. This
breaks my (undocumented) intention that `mount -o
clear_cache,space_cache=v2` would clear the free space tree and then
recreate it.

Fixes: 511711af91f2 ("btrfs: don't run delayed references while we are creating the free space tree")
