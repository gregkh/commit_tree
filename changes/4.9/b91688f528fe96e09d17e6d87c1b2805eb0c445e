x86/vmware: Skip lapic calibration on VMware

In a virtualized environment the APIC timer calibration can go wrong when
the host is overcommitted or the guest is running nested. This results
in the APIC timers operating at an incorrect frequency.

Since VMware supports a mechanism to retrieve the local APIC frequency we
can ask the hypervisor for it and skip the APIC calibration loop.
