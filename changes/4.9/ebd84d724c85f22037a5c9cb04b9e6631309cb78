dax: embed a struct device in dax_dev

The kref in dax_dev can be made redundant if the final put_device() on
the device associated with the dax_dev frees the dax_dev.  This can be
accomplished by embedding a struct device in struct dax_dev, open coding
device_create() and specifying a custom release method.
