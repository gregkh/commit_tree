greybus: arche-platform: Set direction of wake/detect gpio in poweroff fn

With support of interrupt based mechanism, gpio is not longer set to
output mode, so gpio_set_value won't work. So use
gpio_direction_output() fn in poweroff(), while setting value on
wake/detect line.

Testing Done: Tested on DB3.5 platform.
