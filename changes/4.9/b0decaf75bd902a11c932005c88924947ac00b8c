drm/i915: Track active vma requests

Hook the vma itself into the i915_gem_request_retire() so that we can
accurately track when a solitary vma is inactive (as opposed to having
to wait for the entire object to be idle). This improves the interaction
when using multiple contexts (with full-ppgtt) and eliminates some
frequent list walking when retiring objects after a completed request.

A side-effect is that we get an active vma reference for free. The
consequence of this is shown in the next patch...

v2: Update inline names to be consistent with
i915_gem_object_get_active()
