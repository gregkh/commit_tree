drm/i915/guc: doorbell reset should avoid used doorbells

guc_init_doorbell_hw() borrows the (currently single) GuC client to use
in reinitialising ALL the doorbell registers (as the hardware doesn't
reset them when the GuC is reset). As a prerequisite for accommodating
multiple clients, it should only reset doorbells that are supposed to be
disabled, avoiding those that are marked as in use by any client.
