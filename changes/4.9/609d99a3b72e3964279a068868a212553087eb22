Documentation/HOWTO: add cross-references to other documents

Add cross references for the documents mentioned at HOWTO and
are under the Documentation/ directory, using the ReST notation.

It should be noticed that HOWTO also mentions the /README file.
We opted to not touch it, for now, as making it build on
Sphinx would require it to be moved to a Documentation/foo
directory.
