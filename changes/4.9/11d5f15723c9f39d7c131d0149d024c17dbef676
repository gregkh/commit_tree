netfilter: xt_hashlimit: Create revision 2 to support higher pps rates

Create a new revision for the hashlimit iptables extension module. Rev 2
will support higher pps of upto 1 million, Version 1 supports only 10k.

To support this we have to increase the size of the variables avg and
burst in hashlimit_cfg to 64-bit. Create two new structs hashlimit_cfg2
and xt_hashlimit_mtinfo2 and also create newer versions of all the
functions for match, checkentry and destroy.

Some of the functions like hashlimit_mt, hashlimit_mt_check etc are very
similar in both rev1 and rev2 with only minor changes, so I have split
those functions and moved all the common code to a *_common function.
