rcu: Avoid redundant quiescent-state chasing

Currently, __note_gp_changes() checks to see if the CPU has slept through
multiple grace periods.  If it has, it resynchronizes that CPU's view
of the grace-period state, which includes whether or not the current
grace period needs a quiescent state from this CPU.  The fact of this
need (or lack thereof) needs to be in two places, rdp->cpu_no_qs.b.norm
and rdp->core_needs_qs.  The former tells RCU's context-switch code to
go get a quiescent state and the latter says that it needs to be reported.
The current code unconditionally sets the former to true, but correctly
sets the latter.

This does not result in failures, but it does unnecessarily increase
the amount of work done on average at context-switch time.  This commit
therefore correctly sets both fields.
