ACPICA: OSL: Fix a regression that old GCC requires a workaround for strchr()

ACPICA commit be836c36454a624a4fb1d17234080ef8c07993fc

There is a GCC false-warning issue on specific GCC versions that
"strchr" will be preprocessed and extracted to contain
!__buildin_constant_p() checker and it surely is a constant logical
value "1" for strchr() arguments. Then -Wlogical-op errorneously reports a
warning.

The regression is triggered after the standard headers are re-ordered in
the EFI porting task. This patch fixes this regression by moving the
workaround to a new position after including all other standard headers.
