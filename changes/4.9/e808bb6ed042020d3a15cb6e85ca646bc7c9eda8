ATM-iphase: Use kmalloc_array() in tx_init()

* Multiplications for the size determination of memory allocations
  indicated that array data structures should be processed.
  Thus use the corresponding function "kmalloc_array".

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* Replace the specification of data types by pointer dereferences
  to make the corresponding size determination a bit safer according to
  the Linux coding style convention.
