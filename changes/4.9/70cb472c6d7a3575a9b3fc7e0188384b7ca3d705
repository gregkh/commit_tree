drm/i915: Always mark the writer as also a read for busy ioctl

One of the few guarantees we want the busy ioctl to provide is that the
reported busy writer is included in the set of busy read engines. This
should be provided by the ordering of setting and retiring the active
trackers, but we can do better by explicitly setting the busy read
engine flag for the last writer.

v2: More comments inside __busy_write_id() to explain why both fields
are set.
