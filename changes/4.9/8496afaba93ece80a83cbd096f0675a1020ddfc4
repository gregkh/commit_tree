mm,oom_reaper: do not attempt to reap a task twice

"mm, oom_reaper: do not attempt to reap a task twice" tried to give the
OOM reaper one more chance to retry using MMF_OOM_NOT_REAPABLE flag.
But the usefulness of the flag is rather limited and actually never
shown in practice.  If the flag is set, it means that the holder of
mm->mmap_sem cannot call up_write() due to presumably being blocked at
unkillable wait waiting for other thread's memory allocation.  But since
one of threads sharing that mm will queue that mm immediately via
task_will_free_mem() shortcut (otherwise, oom_badness() will select the
same mm again due to oom_score_adj value unchanged), retrying
MMF_OOM_NOT_REAPABLE mm is unlikely helpful.

Let's always set MMF_OOM_REAPED.
