perf intel-pt: Add support for recording the max non-turbo ratio

Previously the maximum non-turbo ratio was calculated from TSC assuming
a 100 MHz multiplier which is correct for current hardware supporting
Intel PT.  However more recent kernels also now export the value, so use
that in preference to the calculated value.
