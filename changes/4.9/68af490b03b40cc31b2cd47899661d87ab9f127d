serial: 8250: enable AFE on ports where FIFO is 16 bytes

Intel Quark has 16550A compatible UART with autoflow feature enabled. It has
only 16 bytes of FIFO. Currently serial8250_do_set_termios() prevents to enable
autoflow since the minimum requirement of 32 bytes of FIFO size.

Drop a FIFO size limitation to allow autoflow control be enabled on such UARTs.

While here, comment out UART_CAP_AFE for PORT_AR7 since it wasn't working and
it will be not a good idea to use it in conjunction with trigger level of 1
byte.
