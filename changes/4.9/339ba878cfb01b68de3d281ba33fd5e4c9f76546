net_sched: flower: Avoid dissection of unmasked keys

The current flower implementation checks the mask range and set all the
keys included in that range as "used_keys", even if a specific key in
the range has a zero mask.

This behavior can cause a false positive return value of
dissector_uses_key function and unnecessary dissection in
__skb_flow_dissect.

This patch checks explicitly the mask of each key and "used_keys" will
be set accordingly.
