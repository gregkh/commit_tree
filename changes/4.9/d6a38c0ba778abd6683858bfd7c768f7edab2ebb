miscdevice: Use module_misc_device() macro

This patch removes module_init()/module_exit() from driver code by using
module_misc_device() macro. All modules in this patch has a print
statement which is removed when module_misc_device() macro is used.
If undesirable this patch can be dropped entirely, this is the only
purpose of making this as a separate patch.
