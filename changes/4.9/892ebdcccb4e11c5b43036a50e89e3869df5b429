PM / Domains: Don't expose xlate and provider helper functions

Functions __of_genpd_xlate_simple(), __of_genpd_xlate_onecell() and
__of_genpd_add_provider() are not used outside of the core generic PM
domain code. Therefore, reduce the number of APIs exposed by making
these static. At the same time don't expose the typedef for
genpd_xlate_t either and make this a local definition as well.

The functions are renamed to follow the naming conventions for static
functions in the generic PM domain core.
