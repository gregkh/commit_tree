fs/efivarfs: Fix double kfree() in error path

Julia reported that we may double free 'name' in efivarfs_callback(),
and that this bug was introduced by commit 0d22f33bc37c ("efi: Don't
use spinlocks for efi vars").

Move one of the kfree()s until after the point at which we know we are
definitely on the success path.
