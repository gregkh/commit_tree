arm64: KVM: Optimize __guest_enter/exit() to save a few instructions

We are doing an unnecessary stack push/pop operation when restoring
the guest registers x0-x18 in __guest_enter(). This patch saves the
two instructions by using x18 as a base register. No need to store
the vcpu context pointer in stack because it is redundant, the same
information is available in tpidr_el2. The function __guest_exit()
calling convention is slightly modified, caller only pushes the regs
x0-x1 to stack instead of regs x0-x3.
