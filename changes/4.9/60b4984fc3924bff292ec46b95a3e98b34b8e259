xfs: support allocating delayed extents in CoW fork

Modify xfs_bmap_add_extent_delay_real() so that we can convert delayed
allocation extents in the CoW fork to real allocations, and wire this
up all the way back to xfs_iomap_write_allocate().  In a subsequent
patch, we'll modify the writepage handler to call this.
