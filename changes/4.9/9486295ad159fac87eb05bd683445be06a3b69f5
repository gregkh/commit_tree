coresight: Use local coresight_desc instances

Each coresight device prepares a description for coresight_register()
in struct coresight_desc. Once we register the device, the description is
useless and can be freed. The coresight_desc is small enough (48bytes on
64bit)i to be allocated on the stack. Hence use an automatic variable to
avoid a needless dynamic allocation and wasting the memory(which will only
be free'd when the device is destroyed).
