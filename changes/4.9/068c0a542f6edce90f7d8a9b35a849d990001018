coresight: Fix csdev connections initialisation

This is a cleanup patch.

coresight_device->conns holds an array to point to the devices
connected to the OUT ports of a component. Sinks, e.g ETR, do not
have an OUT port (nr_outport = 0), as it streams the trace to
memory via AXI.

At coresight_register() we do :

	conns = kcalloc(csdev->nr_outport, sizeof(*conns), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!conns) {
		ret = -ENOMEM;
		goto err_kzalloc_conns;
	}

For ETR, since the total size requested for kcalloc is zero, the return
value is, ZERO_SIZE_PTR ( != NULL). Hence, csdev->conns = ZERO_SIZE_PTR
which cannot be verified later to contain a valid pointer. The code which
accesses the csdev->conns is bounded by the csdev->nr_outport check,
hence we don't try to dereference the ZERO_SIZE_PTR. This patch cleans
up the csdev->conns initialisation to make sure we initialise it
properly(i.e, either NULL or valid conns array).
