IB/mlx5: Port events in RoCE now rely on netdev events

Since ib_query_port() in RoCE returns the state of its netdev as the port
state, it makes sense to propagate the port up/down events to ib_core
when the netdev port state changes, instead of relying on traditional
core events.

This also keeps both the event and ib_query_port() synchronized.
