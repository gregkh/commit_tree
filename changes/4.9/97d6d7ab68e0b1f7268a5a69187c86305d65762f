drm/i915: Update GGTT initialisation functions to take drm_i915_private

Since these are internal functions they operate on drm_i915_private and
not the drm_device being passed in. So pass in the drm_i915_private
instead, and remove one layer of dancing. No space wins here, just
conforming to the norm in function parameters.

v2: Include all the probe functions
