greybus: interface: drop the control bundle

Drop the control bundle and ignore control descriptors when parsing
manifests.

Every interface has a control connection with a well defined remote
CPort 0 and there's no longer any need to create a bundle for it.

As the control connection is setup and enabled before parsing the
manifest, ignore any legacy descriptors for control cports and bundles
in a manifest.
