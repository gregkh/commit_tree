greybus: audio: Fetch jack_mask, button_mask from module's topology data

Added extra fields namely jack_mask & button_mask for each module_info.
These fields are required while registering jack & reporting jack
events.

Earlier, these were hard coded values assuming fixed capabilities say
HEADSET, LINEOUT, etc. supported by GB-codec driver. Now these are
computed dynamically based on module's jack capability shared via
topology data.
