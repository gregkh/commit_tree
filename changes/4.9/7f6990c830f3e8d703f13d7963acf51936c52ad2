cfg80211: let ieee80211_amsdu_to_8023s() take only header-less SKB

There's only a single case where has_80211_header is passed as true,
which is in mac80211. Given that there's only simple code that needs
to be done before calling it, export that function from cfg80211
instead and let mac80211 call it itself.
