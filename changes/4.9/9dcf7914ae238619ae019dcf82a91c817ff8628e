arm64: kernel: use x30 for __enable_mmu return address

Using x27 for passing to __enable_mmu what is essentially the return
address makes the code look more complicated than it needs to be. So
switch to x30/lr, and update the secondary and cpu_resume call sites to
simply call __enable_mmu as an ordinary function, with a bl instruction.
This requires the callers to be covered by .idmap.text.
