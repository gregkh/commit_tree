CIFS: Reset read oplock to NONE if we have mandatory locks after reopen

We are already doing the same thing for an ordinary open case:
we can't keep read oplock on a file if we have mandatory byte-range
locks because pagereading can conflict with these locks on a server.
Fix it by setting oplock level to NONE.
