block_dev: remove DAX leftovers

DAX support for block devices was removed in commits 03cdad
("block: disable block device DAX by default") and 99a01cd
("block: remove BLK_DEV_DAX config option"), but we still kept a call to
dax_do_io and some uneeded i_flags manipulations introduced in commit
bbab37 ("block: Add support for DAX reads/writes to block devices").

Remove those leftovers.
