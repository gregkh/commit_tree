Revert "drm/i915: Check live status before reading edid"

This reverts commit 237ed86c693d8a8e4db476976aeb30df4deac74b.

Our current implementation of live status check (repeat 9 times
with 10ms delays between each attempt as a workaround for
buggy displays) imposes a rather serious penalty, time wise,
on intel_hdmi_detect().  Since we we already skip live status
checks on platforms before gen 7, and since we seem to have
coped quite well before the live status check was introduced
for newer platforms too, the previous behaviour is probably
preferable, at least unless someone can point to a use-case
that the live status check improves (apart from "Bspec says so".)
