drm/i915: Drop ORIGIN_GTT for untracked GTT writes

If FBC is set on a framebuffer that is unmapped, all GTT faults will be
from a partial mapping. Writes by the user through the partial VMA are
then untracked by the FBC and so we must use the ORIGIN_CPU when flushing
the I915_GEM_DOMAIN_GTT.

v2: Keep ORIGIN_CPU for set-to-domain(.write=CPU)
