pstore/core: drop cmpxchg based updates

I have here a FPGA behind PCIe which exports SRAM which I use for
pstore. Now it seems that the FPGA no longer supports cmpxchg based
updates and writes back 0xffâ€¦ff and returns the same.  This leads to
crash during crash rendering pstore useless.
Since I doubt that there is much benefit from using cmpxchg() here, I am
dropping this atomic access and use the spinlock based version.
