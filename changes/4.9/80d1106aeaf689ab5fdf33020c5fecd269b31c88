Revert: "ip6_tunnel: Update skb->protocol to ETH_P_IPV6 in ip6_tnl_xmit()"

This reverts commit ae148b085876fa771d9ef2c05f85d4b4bf09ce0d
("ip6_tunnel: Update skb->protocol to ETH_P_IPV6 in ip6_tnl_xmit()").

skb->protocol is now set in __ip_local_out() and __ip6_local_out() before
dst_output() is called. It is no longer necessary to do it for each tunnel.
