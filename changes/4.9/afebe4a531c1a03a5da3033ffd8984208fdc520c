staging: lustre: reorder LOV_MAGIC_* definition

Since all the LOV_MAGIC_* definitions have the same
postfix values break that value out into its own
definition. With this we can check whether the magic's
postfix match the LOV_MAGIC_MAGIC or not: if yes,
then it is quite possible that the clients has
encountered an newer LOV magic. This extra information
can let us handle those cases more gracefully.
