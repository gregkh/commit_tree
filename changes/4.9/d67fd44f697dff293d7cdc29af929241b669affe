locks: Filter /proc/locks output on proc pid ns

On busy container servers reading /proc/locks shows all the locks
created by all clients. This can cause large latency spikes. In my
case I observed lsof taking up to 5-10 seconds while processing around
50k locks. Fix this by limiting the locks shown only to those created
in the same pidns as the one the proc fs was mounted in. When reading
/proc/locks from the init_pid_ns proc instance then perform no
filtering
