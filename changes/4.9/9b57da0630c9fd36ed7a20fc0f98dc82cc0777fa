netfilter: ipv6: nf_defrag: drop mangled skb on ream error

Dmitry Vyukov reported GPF in network stack that Andrey traced down to
negative nh offset in nf_ct_frag6_queue().

Problem is that all network headers before fragment header are pulled.
Normal ipv6 reassembly will drop the skb when errors occur further down
the line.

netfilter doesn't do this, and instead passed the original fragment
along.  That was also fine back when netfilter ipv6 defrag worked with
cloned fragments, as the original, pristine fragment was passed on.

So we either have to undo the pull op, or discard such fragments.
Since they're malformed after all (e.g. overlapping fragment) it seems
preferrable to just drop them.

Same for temporary errors -- it doesn't make sense to accept (and
perhaps forward!) only some fragments of same datagram.
