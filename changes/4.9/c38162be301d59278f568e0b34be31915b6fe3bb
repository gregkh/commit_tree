video: ARM CLCD: backlight support for OF

If the device is probed from device tree, we can support
backlight. This is used with some systems such as the
ST Microelectronics Nomadik.

We have to add HAS_IOMEM to the dependencies of CLCD since
the backlight class device will now be selected, and if it
gets selected on an arch that does not have IOMEM,
compilation will fail.
