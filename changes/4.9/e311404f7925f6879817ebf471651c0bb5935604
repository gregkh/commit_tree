ACPI / PAD: don't register acpi_pad driver if running as Xen dom0

When running as Xen dom0 a special processor_aggregator driver is
needed.  Don't register the standard driver in this case.

Without that check an error message:

"Error: Driver 'processor_aggregator' is already registered,
aborting..."

will be displayed.
