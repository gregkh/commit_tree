objtool: Add do_task_dead() to global noreturn list

objtool reports the following new warning:

  kernel/exit.o: warning: objtool: do_exit() falls through to next function complete_and_exit()

The warning is caused by do_exit()'s new call to do_task_dead(), which
is a new "noreturn" function which objtool doesn't know about yet,
introduced by:

  9af6528ee9b6 ("sched/core: Optimize __schedule()")

( objtool has to know all the global noreturn functions so it can follow
  the control flow of any functions which call them.  Unfortunately they
  need to be hard-coded because there's no automated way to detect them. )
