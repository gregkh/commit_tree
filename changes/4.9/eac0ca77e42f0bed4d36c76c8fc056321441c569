x86, pkeys: remove cruft from never-merged syscalls

pkey_set() and pkey_get() were syscalls present in older versions
of the protection keys patches.  The syscall number definitions
were inadvertently left in place.  This patch removes them.

I did a git grep and verified that these are the last places in
the tree that these appear, save for the protection_keys.c tests
and Documentation.  Those spots talk about functions called
pkey_get/set() which are wrappers for the direct PKRU
instructions, not the syscalls.
