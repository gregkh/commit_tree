sched/core: Introduce SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY sched_domain topology flag

Add a topology flag to the sched_domain hierarchy indicating the lowest
domain level where the full range of CPU capacities is represented by
the domain members for asymmetric capacity topologies (e.g. ARM
big.LITTLE).

The flag is intended to indicate that extra care should be taken when
placing tasks on CPUs and this level spans all the different types of
CPUs found in the system (no need to look further up the domain
hierarchy). This information is currently only available through
iterating through the capacities of all the CPUs at parent levels in the
sched_domain hierarchy.

  SD 2      [  0      1      2      3]  SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY

  SD 1      [  0      1] [   2      3]  !SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY

  CPU:         0      1      2      3
  capacity:  756    756   1024   1024

If the topology in the example above is duplicated to create an eight
CPU example with third sched_domain level on top (SD 3), this level
should not have the flag set (!SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY) as its two group
would both have all CPU capacities represented within them.
