x86/ptrace: Down with test_thread_flag(TIF_IA32)

As the task isn't executing at the moment of {GET,SET}REGS,
return regset that corresponds to code selector, rather than
value of TIF_IA32 flag.
I.e. if we ptrace i386 elf binary that has just changed it's
code selector to __USER_CS, than GET_REGS will return
full x86_64 register set.

Note, that this will work only if application has changed it's CS.
If the application does 32-bit syscall with __USER_CS, ptrace
will still return 64-bit register set. Which might be still confusing
for tools that expect TS_COMPACT to be exposed [1, 2].

So this this change should make PTRACE_GETREGSET more reliable and
this will be another step to drop TIF_{IA32,X32} flags.
