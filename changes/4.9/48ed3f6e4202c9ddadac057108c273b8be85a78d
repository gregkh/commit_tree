greybus: connection: remove special check for svc cport id

This is required to get things working for now, after the latest revert
of svc protocol is done.

Currently svc's cport id is set to 2 and that hd cport id will be used
for the third connection we make. And that protocol (which is i2c in one
of the cases), may not work as the (dis)connected event isn't sent for
it.

Fix this by getting rid of svc protocol check from (dis)connected
events for now. This must be reverted later, once svc protocol is
included again.
