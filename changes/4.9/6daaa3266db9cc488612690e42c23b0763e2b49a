MIPS: Remove FIR from ISA I FP signal context

Complement commit e50c0a8fa60d ("Support the MIPS32 / MIPS64 DSP ASE.")
and remove the Floating Point Implementation Register (FIR) from the FP
register set recorded in a signal context with MIPS I processors too, in
line with the change applied to r4k_fpu.S.

The `sc_fpc_eir' slot is unused according to our current ABI and the FIR
register is read-only and always directly accessible from user software.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: This is also required because the next commit depends
on it.]
