clk: imx: fix integer overflow in AV PLL round rate

Since 'parent_rate * mfn' may overflow 32 bits, the result should be
stored using 64 bits.

The problem was discovered when trying to set the rate of the audio PLL
(pll4_post_div) on an i.MX6Q. The desired rate was 196.608 MHz, but
the actual rate returned was 192.000570 MHz. The round rate function should
have been able to return 196.608 MHz, i.e., the desired rate.
