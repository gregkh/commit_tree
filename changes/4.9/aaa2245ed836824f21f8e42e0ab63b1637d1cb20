cxl: Flush PSL cache before resetting the adapter

If the capi link is going down while the PSL owns a dirty cache line,
any access from the host for that data could lead to an Uncorrectable
Error.

So when resetting the capi adapter through sysfs, make sure the PSL
cache is flushed. It won't help if there are any active Process
Elements on the card, as the cache would likely get new dirty cache
lines immediately, but if resetting an idle adapter, it should avoid
any bad surprises from data left over from terminated Process Elements.
