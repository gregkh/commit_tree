There are two VOP in rk3399 chip, respectively VOP_BIG and VOP_LIT.
most registers layout of this two vop is same, their framework are both
VOP_FULL, the Major differences of this two is that:

VOP_BIG max output resolution is 4096x2160.
VOP_LIT max output resolution is 2560x1600

VOP_BIG support four windows.
VOP_LIT only support two windows.

RK3399 vop register layout is similar with rk3288, so some feature
can reuse with rk3288.
