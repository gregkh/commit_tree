x86/apic: Fix silent & fatal merge conflict in __generic_processor_info()

Fix up the silent merge conflict between commit c291b0151585 in x86/urgent
and commit f7c28833c2520 in x86/apic which both remove num_processors++
from the original location and then add it at two different locations. As a
result num_processors is incremented twice which can cut the number of
available cpus in half.

Remove the one which is added by commit c291b0151585.

In hindsight I should have merged x86/urgent into x86/apic _before_ adding
the nodeid bits, but in hindsight we are always smarter.
