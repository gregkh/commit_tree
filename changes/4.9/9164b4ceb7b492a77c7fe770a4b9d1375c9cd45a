x86/sysfb: Add support for 64bit EFI lfb_base

The screen_info object was extended to support 64-bit lfb_base addresses
in:

  ae2ee627dc87 ("efifb: Add support for 64-bit frame buffer addresses")

However, the x86 simple-framebuffer setup code never made use of it. Fix
it to properly assemble and verify the lfb_base before advertising
simple-framebuffer devices.

In particular, this means if VIDEO_CAPABILITY_64BIT_BASE is set, the
screen_info->ext_lfb_base field will contain the upper 32bit of the
actual lfb_base. Make sure the address is not 0 (i.e., unset), as well as
does not overflow the physical address type.
