net: fs_enet: make rx_copybreak value configurable

Measurement shows that on a MPC8xx running at 132MHz, the optimal
limit is 112:
* 114 bytes packets are processed in 147 TB ticks with higher copybreak
* 114 bytes packets are processed in 148 TB ticks with lower copybreak
* 128 bytes packets are processed in 154 TB ticks with higher copybreak
* 128 bytes packets are processed in 148 TB ticks with lower copybreak
* 238 bytes packets are processed in 172 TB ticks with higher copybreak
* 238 bytes packets are processed in 148 TB ticks with lower copybreak

However it might be different on other processors
and/or frequencies. So it is useful to make it configurable.
