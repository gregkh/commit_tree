clk: mvebu: fix setting unwanted flags in CP110 gate clock

Armada CP110 system controller comprises its own routine responsble
for registering gate clocks. Among others 'flags' field in
struct clk_init_data was not set, using a random values, which
may cause an unpredicted behavior.

This patch fixes the problem by resetting all fields of clk_init_data
before assigning values for all gated clocks of Armada 7k/8k SoCs family.
