drm/vmwgfx: select CONFIG_FB

vmwgfx doesn't actually build without that.

It would be great if vmwgfx could switch over to the fbdev emulation
helpers, since those will take care of all this already. I guess one
reason to not do that was lack of defio support in the helpers, but
that's fixed now. If there's any other hold-up, we should figure out
what it is and whether it makes sense to address it.
