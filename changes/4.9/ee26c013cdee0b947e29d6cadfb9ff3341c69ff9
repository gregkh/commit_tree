genirq/generic_chip: Add irq_unmap callback

Without this patch irq_domain_disassociate() cannot properly release the
interrupt. In fact, irq_map_generic_chip() checks a bit on 'gc->installed'
but said bit is never cleared, only set.

Commit 088f40b7b027 ("genirq: Generic chip: Add linear irq domain support")
added irq_map_generic_chip() function and also stated "This lacks a removal
function for now".

This commit provides an implementation of an unmap function that can be
called by irq_domain_disassociate().

[ tglx: Made the function static and removed the export as we have neither
  	a prototype nor a modular user. ]
