dmaengine: k3dma: use correct format string for debug output

The newly added k3_dma_prep_dma_cyclic function has some debug output
that uses incorrect typecasts, some of which cause a warning like:

drivers/dma/k3dma.c: In function 'k3_dma_prep_dma_cyclic':
drivers/dma/k3dma.c:589:671: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]

In general, we have to print 'dma_addr_t' values using special
'%pad' format to get the correct behavior on kernels that have
a 64-bit dma_addr_t type but 32-bit pointers.

Similarly, printing size_t values should be done using the %z
modifier to get the correct behavior on 64-bit kernels.
