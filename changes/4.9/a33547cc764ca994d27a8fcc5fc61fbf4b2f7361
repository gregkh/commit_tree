pinctrl-aspeed-g5: Never set SCU90[6]

If a pin depending on bit 6 in SCU90 is requested for GPIO, the export
will succeed but changes to the GPIO's value will not be accepted by the
hardware. This is because the pinmux driver has misconfigured the SCU by
writing 1 to the reserved bit.

The description of SCU90[6] from the datasheet is 'Reserved, must keep
at value ”0”'. The fix is to switch pinmux from the bit-flipping macro
to explicitly configuring the .enable and .disable values to zero.

The patch has been tested on an AST2500 EVB.
