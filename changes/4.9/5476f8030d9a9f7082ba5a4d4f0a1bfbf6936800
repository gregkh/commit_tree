mwifiex: fix race condition causing tx timeout

It's been observed that in a corner case mwifiex_usb_tx_complete()
gets called before we exit from mwifiex_usb_host_to_card() after
submitting the urb. 'data_sent' flag remains set in this case. It
blocks further Tx packets and triggers watchdog timeout.

The problem is fixed by setting data_sent and port_block flag at
correct place.
