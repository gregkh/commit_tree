SUNRPC: Refactor rpc_xdr_buf_init()

Clean up: there is some XDR initialization logic that is common
to the forward channel and backchannel. Move it to an XDR header
so it can be shared.

rpc_rqst::rq_buffer points to a buffer containing big-endian data.
Update its annotation as part of the clean up.
