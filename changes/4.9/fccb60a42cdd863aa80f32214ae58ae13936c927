md-cluster: convert the completion to wait queue

Previously, we used completion to sync between require dlm lock
and sync_ast, however we will have to expose completion.wait
and completion.done in dlm_lock_sync_interruptible (introduced
later), it is not a common usage for completion, so convert
related things to wait queue.
