xfs: create refcount update intent log items

Create refcount update intent/done log items to record redo
information in the log.  Because we need to roll transactions between
updating the bmbt mapping and updating the reverse mapping, we also
have to track the status of the metadata updates that will be recorded
in the post-roll transactions, just in case we crash before committing
the final transaction.  This mechanism enables log recovery to finish
what was already started.
