watchdog: imx2_wdt: add pretimeout function support

The change adds watchdog pretimeout notification handling to imx2_wdt
driver, if device data contains information about a valid interrupt.

It is unlikely but still possible (e.g. through a software limitation)
that only a subset of watchdogs on SoC has interrupt lines, hence
functionally the devices from these two groups have different
capabilities, and this is reflected in different watchdog_info
structs assigned to the devices.
