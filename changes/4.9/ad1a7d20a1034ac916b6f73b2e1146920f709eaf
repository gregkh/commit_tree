drm/i915: Update the GGTT size/alignment query functions

In order to be consistent with other address space functions, we want to
pass around 64-bit sizes, even though all known global GTT are limited
to 4GiB. Similarly, we are trying to be consistent in using the _ggtt_
nomenclature when referring to the special global GTT.

v2: Update docs to consistently state "global GTT".
