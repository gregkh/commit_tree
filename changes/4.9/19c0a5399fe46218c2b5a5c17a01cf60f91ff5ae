i2c: designware: Move clk_freq into struct dw_i2c_dev

I2c designware controller operate speed is configured in the register
IC_CON. Previously the operate speed is determined by a local variable
clk_freq. This patch will move the local variable clk_freq into struct
dw_i2c_dev. This change will ease the set and get of the clk_freq.
