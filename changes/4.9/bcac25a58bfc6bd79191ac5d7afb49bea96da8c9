kernel: add a helper to get an owning user namespace for a namespace

Return -EPERM if an owning user namespace is outside of a process
current user namespace.

v2: In a first version ns_get_owner returned ENOENT for init_user_ns.
    This special cases was removed from this version. There is nothing
    outside of init_user_ns, so we can return EPERM.
v3: rename ns->get_owner() to ns->owner(). get_* usually means that it
grabs a reference.
