Revert "console: don't prefer first registered if DT specifies stdout-path"

This reverts commit 05fd007e4629 ("console: don't prefer first
registered if DT specifies stdout-path").

The reverted commit changes existing behavior on which many ARM boards
rely.  Many ARM small-board-computers, like e.g.  the Raspberry Pi have
both a video output and a serial console.  Depending on whether the user
is using the device as a more regular computer; or as a headless device
we need to have the console on either one or the other.

Many users rely on the kernel behavior of the console being present on
both outputs, before the reverted commit the console setup with no
console= kernel arguments on an ARM board which sets stdout-path in dt
would look like this:

  [root@localhost ~]# cat /proc/consoles
  ttyS0                -W- (EC p a)    4:64
  tty0                 -WU (E  p  )    4:1

Where as after the reverted commit, it looks like this:

  [root@localhost ~]# cat /proc/consoles
  ttyS0                -W- (EC p a)    4:64

This commit reverts commit 05fd007e4629 ("console: don't prefer first
registered if DT specifies stdout-path") restoring the original
behavior.
