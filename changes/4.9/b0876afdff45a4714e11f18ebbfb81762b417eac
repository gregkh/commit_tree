drm/i915: Only expand COND once in wait_for()

Commentary from Chris Wilson's original version:

> I was looking at some wait_for() timeouts on a slow system, with lots of
> debug enabled (KASAN, lockdep, mmio_debug). Thinking that we were
> mishandling the timeout, I tried to ensure that we loop at least once
> after first testing COND. However, the double test of COND either side
> of the timeout check makes that unlikely. But we can do an equivalent
> loop, that keeps the COND check after testing for timeout (required so
> that we are not preempted between testing COND and then testing for a
> timeout) without expanding COND twice.

but it turned out that due to a missing iniitialiser, gcc had "gone
wild trimming undefined code" :( This version acheives a rather more
modest (but still worthwhile) gain of ~550 bytes.
