ARM: tegra: Fix Tegra114 USB compatible values

DT compatible values should always include an entry for the specific
chip in addition to any earlier generations that the HW is backwards-
compatible with.

This doesn't affect the kernel at all given current driver code, but
U-Boot needs to distinguish between Tegra114 and Tegra30 for this HW,
and I'd like to synchronize the DT content.
