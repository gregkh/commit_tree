staging: lustre: llite: Add ioctl to get parent fids from link EA.

Added LL_IOC_GETPARENT to retrieve the <parent_fid>/name(s) of a given
entry, based on its link EA. This saves multiple calls to
path2fid/fid2path.

Merged with second later patch that does various cleanups.
Avoid unneeded allocation. Get read-only attributes from the user
getparent structure and write the modified attributes only, instead
of populating a whole structure in kernel and copying it back.
