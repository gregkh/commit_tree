iwlwifi: mvm: fix pending frames tracking on tx resp

In iwl_mvm_rx_tx_cmd_single(), when checking if a given TID is
aggregated, the driver doesn't check whether or not the queue
itself can be aggregated. For example, a management queue might
be marked as aggregated if TID 0 is aggregated on a (different)
data queue.

Make sure that mgmt frames are sent with TID IWL_TID_NON_QOS,
and in this way make sure no mixups of this sort happen.
