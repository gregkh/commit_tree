clk: bcm: kona: Migrate to clk_hw based registration and OF APIs

Now that we can use clk_hw pointers we don't need to have two
duplicate arrays holding the same mapping of clk index to clk_hw
pointer. Implement a custom clk_hw provider function to map the
OF specifier to the clk_hw instance for it.
