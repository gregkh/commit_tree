KVM: fix OOPS on flush_work

The conversion done by commit 3706feacd007 ("KVM: Remove deprecated
create_singlethread_workqueue") is broken.  It flushes a single work
item &irqfd->shutdown instead of all of them, and even worse if there
is no irqfd on the list then you get a NULL pointer dereference.
Revert the virt/kvm/eventfd.c part of that patch; to avoid the
deprecated function, just allocate our own workqueue---it does
not even have to be unbound---with alloc_workqueue.
