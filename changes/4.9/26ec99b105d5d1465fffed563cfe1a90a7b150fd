char/mwave: remove custom BOOLEAN type

The mwave driver has its own macros for the BOOLEAN type and the
TRUE/FALSE values. This is redundant because the kernel already
has bool/true/false, and it clashes with the ACPI headers that
also define these types. The linux/acpi.h header is now included
implicitly from mwave through the mc146818rtc.h header, as
reported by Stephen Rothwell:

In file included from drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c:51:0:
drivers/char/mwave/smapi.h:52:0: warning: "TRUE" redefined
 #define TRUE 1
 ^
In file included from include/acpi/acpi.h:58:0,
                 from include/linux/acpi.h:33,
                 from include/linux/mc146818rtc.h:21,
                 from drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c:50:
include/acpi/actypes.h:438:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
 #define TRUE                            (1 == 1)
 ^

This removes the private types from mwave and uses the standard
types instead.
