drm/i915: Don't mark PCH underrun reporting as disabled for transcoder B/C on LPT-H

Marking PCH transcoder FIFO underrun reporting as disabled for
transcoder B/C on LPT-H will block us from enabling the south error
interrupt. So let's only mark transcoder A underrun reporting as
disabled initially.

This is a little tricky to hit since you need a machine with LPT-H, and
the BIOS must enable either pipe B or C at boot. Then i915 would mark
the "transcoder B/C" underrun reporting as disabled and never enable it
again, meaning south interrupts would never get enabled either. The only
other interrupt in there is actually the poison interrupt which, if we
could ever trigger it, would just result in a little error in dmesg.

Here's the resulting change in SDEIMR on my HSW when I boot it with
multiple displays attached:
- (0x000c4004): 0xf115ffff
+ (0x000c4004): 0xf114ffff

My previous attempt [1] tried to fix this a little differently, but
Daniel requested I do this instead.
