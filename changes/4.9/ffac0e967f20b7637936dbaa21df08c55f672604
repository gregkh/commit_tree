net: macb: ensure ordering write to re-enable RX smoothly

When a hardware issue happened as described by inline comments, the register
write pattern looks like the following:

<write ~MACB_BIT(RE)>
+ wmb();
<write MACB_BIT(RE)>

There might be a memory barrier between these two write operations, so add wmb
to ensure an flip from 0 to 1 for NCR.
