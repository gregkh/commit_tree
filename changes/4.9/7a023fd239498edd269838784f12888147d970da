perf probe: Fix dwarf regs table for x86_64

In 293d5b439483 ("perf probe: Support probing on offline cross-arch binary")
DWARF register tables were introduced for many architectures, with the one for
the "dx" register being broken for x86_64, which got noticed by the 'perf test
bpf' testcase, that has this difference from a successful run to one that
fails, with the aforementioned patch:

  -Writing event: p:perf_bpf_probe/func _text+5197232 f_mode=+68(%di):x32 offset=%si:s64 orig=dx:s32
  -Failed to write event: Invalid argument
  -bpf_probe: failed to apply perf probe eventsFailed to add events selected by BPF
  +Writing event: p:perf_bpf_probe/func _text+5197232 f_mode=+68(%di):x32 offset=%si:s64 orig=%dx:s32

Add the missing '%' to '%dx' to fix this.
