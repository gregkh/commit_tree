drm/amdgpu: mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/cz_smc.c:51:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'cz_send_msg_to_smc_async' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/cz_smc.c:143:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'cz_write_smc_sram_dword' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/iceland_smc.c:124:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'iceland_start_smc' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v8_0.c:3926:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'gfx_v8_0_rlc_stop' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_job.c:94:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'amdgpu_job_free_cb' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
So this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
