iommu/arm-smmu: Handle stream IDs more dynamically

Rather than assuming fixed worst-case values for stream IDs and SMR
masks, keep track of whatever implemented bits the hardware actually
reports. This also obviates the slightly questionable validation of SMR
fields in isolation - rather than aborting the whole SMMU probe for a
hardware configuration which is still architecturally valid, we can
simply refuse masters later if they try to claim an unrepresentable ID
or mask (which almost certainly implies a DT error anyway).
