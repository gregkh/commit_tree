greybus: arche-platform: ensure wake-detect pin is deasserted

During DB3.5 bringup, it was noted that wake_detect signal was not
properly generating SVC edge IRQ.  To ensure signal goes from low
to high correctly, let's bring signal low (regardless of default
pin state).

Testing Done:
- Used for DB3.5/EVT1.5 hardware during bringup
- Regression tested on DB3.1+ES2, DB3.1+ES3
