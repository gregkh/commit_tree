tipc: fix link statistics counter errors

In commit e4bf4f76962b ("tipc: simplify packet sequence number
handling") we changed the internal representation of the packet
sequence number counters from u32 to u16, reflecting what is really
sent over the wire.

Since then some link statistics counters have been displaying incorrect
values, partially because the counters meant to be used as sequence
number snapshots are now used as direct counters, stored as u32, and
partially because some counter updates are just missing in the code.

In this commit we correct this in two ways. First, we base the
displayed packet sent/received values on direct counters instead
of as previously a calculated difference between current sequence
number and a snapshot. Second, we add the missing updates of the
counters.

This change is compatible with the current netlink API, and requires
no changes to the user space tools.
