greybus: loopback: drop bus aggregate calculation

At some point we had a statement in a Jira work item to pull out 'bus
level' data from greybus and to have messages to different interfaces be
synchronized with respect to each other. Synchronizing threads with respect
to each other is slow and it turns out we can get the same 'bus level'
stastics by making the user-space test application smarter.

That's great news for the in-kernel code since it means we can cut out a
whole lot of code to-do with calculating 'bus level' aggregate data and we
can stop forcing threads to hit a rendezvous before sending out another
loopback operation.

So this patch drops bus level aggregates in favour of doing that in
user-space. It subtracts a lot of code and cycles that in practice nobody
cares about anyway.
