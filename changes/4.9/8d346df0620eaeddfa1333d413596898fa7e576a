greybus: gpbridge: fix section mismatches

Fix section mismatches introduced by b27227ce93c0 ("greybus: Use
gb_gpbridge_protocol_init()"), which added __exit annotation to
gpbridge-protocol exit functions that are called in the error path of
gpbridge_init, which lives in the init section.

This triggered the following modpost warning:

	WARNING: modpost: Found 8 section mismatch(es).
