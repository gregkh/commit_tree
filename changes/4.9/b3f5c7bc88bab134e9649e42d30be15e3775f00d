i40e: Fix for extra byte swap in tunnel setup

This patch fixes an issue where we were byte swapping the port
parameter, then byte swapping it again in function execution.
Obviously, that's unnecessary, so take it out of the function calls.
Without this patch, the udp based tunnel configuration would
not be correct.
