drm/i915: SAGV is not SKL-only, so rename a few things

The plan is to introduce intel_has_sagv() and then use it to discover
which platforms actually support it.

I thought about keeping the functions with their current skl names,
but found two problems: (i) skl_has_sagv() would become a very
confusing name, and (ii) intel_atomic_commit_tail() doesn't seem to be
calling any functions whose name start with a platform name, so the
"intel_" naming scheme seems make more sense than the "firstplatorm_"
naming scheme here.
