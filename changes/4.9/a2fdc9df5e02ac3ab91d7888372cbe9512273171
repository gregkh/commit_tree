[media] cec: allow configuration both from within driver and from user space

It makes sense for adapters such as the Pulse-Eight to be configurable
both from within the driver and from user space, so remove the
requirement that drivers only can call cec_s_log_addrs or
cec_s_phys_addr if they don't expose those capabilities to user space.
