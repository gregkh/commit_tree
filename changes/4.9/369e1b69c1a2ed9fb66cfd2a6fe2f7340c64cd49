staging: ks7010: return on failure

On failure we were jumping to error_out0 where we were trying
sdio_release_host() but at this point of execution we still have not
done sdio_claim_host() and as a result host->claimed can still be 0.
And if host->claimed is 0 then WARN_ON(!host->claimed) will give
a warning.
Moreover, if it is still not claimed then mmc_host->claim_cnt will be 0
and mmc_release_host() will do "if (--host->claim_cnt)" and thus the
condition will become true.
Lets just return the value on allocation failure instead of trying to
release the host before claiming it.
