rtnl: reset calcit fptr in rtnl_unregister()

To avoid having dangling function pointers left behind, reset calcit in
rtnl_unregister(), too.

This is no issue so far, as only the rtnl core registers a netlink
handler with a calcit hook which won't be unregistered, but may become
one if new code makes use of the calcit hook.
