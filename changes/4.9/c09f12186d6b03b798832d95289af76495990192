acpi, nfit: check for the correct event code in notifications

Commit 209851649dc4 "acpi: nfit: Add support for hot-add" added
support for _FIT notifications, but it neglected to verify the
notification event code matches the one in the ACPI spec for
"NFIT Update". Currently there is only one code in the spec, but
once additional codes are added, older kernels (without this fix)
will misbehave by assuming all event notifications are for an
NFIT Update.
