ALSA: seq: obsolete change of address limit

Former commits change existent functions so that they don't handle data in
kernel space. Copying from/to userspace is done outside of the functions,
thus no need to change address limit of running task.

This commit obsoletes get_fs()/set_fs() and applies corresponding changes.
