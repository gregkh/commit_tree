perf: xgene: Remove bogus IS_ERR() check

In acpi_get_pmu_hw_inf we pass the address of a local variable to IS_ERR(),
which doesn't make sense, as the pointer must be a real, valid pointer.
This doesn't cause a functional problem, as IS_ERR() will evaluate as
false, but the check is bogus and causes static checkers to complain.

Remove the bogus check.
