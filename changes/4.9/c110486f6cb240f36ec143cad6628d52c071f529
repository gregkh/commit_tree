proc: make proc entries inherit ownership from parent

There are certain parameters that belong to net namespace and that are
exported in /proc. They should be controllable by the container's owner,
but are currently owned by global root and thus not available.

Let's change proc code to inherit ownership of parent entry, and when
create per-ns "net" proc entry set it up as owned by container's owner.
