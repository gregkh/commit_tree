greybus: usb: use the bundle struct device instead of the connector

We are removing struct device from the gb_connection structure in the
near future.  The gb_bundle structure's struct device should be used as
a replacement.

This patch moves the usb driver to use the bundle pointer instead of the
connection pointer.
