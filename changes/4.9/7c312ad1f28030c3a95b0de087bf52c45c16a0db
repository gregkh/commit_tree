ACPICA: Disassembler: Add option to emit embedded External operators/opcodes

ACPICA commit 152a8ca2c7fc877d6aff0f9d0965184ef2ddce5c

Opcode 0x15 was added in ACPI 6.0 for disassemblers.
The disassembler by default does not emit the actual opcodes, they
are used internally. Option added for internal debugging only.

This patch doesn't affect Linux kernel as disassembler is not in
the Linux kernel.
