greybus: svc: Set interface's hotplug attributes before using them

gb_svc_read_and_clear_module_boot_status() relies on the values of
ddbl1_manufacturer_id and ddbl1_product_id to distinguish between ES2
and ES3 chips, but those values are set for the interface structure only
after gb_svc_read_and_clear_module_boot_status() is called.

This makes ES2 module to fail with following errors:

greybus 1-2: Module not ready yet
greybus 1-svc: failed to clear boot status of interface 2: -19

Fix this by setting these values before calling
gb_svc_read_and_clear_module_boot_status().
