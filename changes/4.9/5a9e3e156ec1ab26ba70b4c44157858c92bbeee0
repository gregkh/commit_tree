arm64: apply __ro_after_init to some objects

These objects are set during initialization, thereafter are read only.

Previously I only want to mark vdso_pages, vdso_spec, vectors_page and
cpu_ops as __read_mostly from performance point of view. Then inspired
by Kees's patch[1] to apply more __ro_after_init for arm, I think it's
better to mark them as __ro_after_init. What's more, I find some more
objects are also read only after init. So apply __ro_after_init to all
of them.

This patch also removes global vdso_pagelist and tries to clean up
vdso_spec[] assignment code.
