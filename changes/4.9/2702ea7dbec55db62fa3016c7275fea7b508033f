i2c: designware: wait for disable/enable only if necessary

If we aren't going to continue using the controller we can just disable
it instead of waiting for it to complete. The biggest improvement here
is when a I2C transaction is completed and it doesn't block until
the adapter is disabled. When a new transfer is needed we will disable
and wait for its completion.

This way the adapter will continue changing its state in parallel to the
execution of the thread that requested the I2C transaction saving most
of the time 25~250 usec per I2C transaction.

A simple program doing a register read (1 byte write, 1 byte read)
alternating on 2 different slaves repeated 25k times for each and
measurements taken 4 times we get:

perf stat -r4 chrt -f 10 ./i2c-test /dev/i2c-1 25000 0x40 0x6 0x1e 0x00
