unicore32: use simpler API for random address requests

Currently, all callers to randomize_range() set the length to 0 and
calculate end by adding a constant to the start address.  We can simplify
the API to remove a bunch of needless checks and variables.

Use the new randomize_addr(start, range) call to set the requested
address.
