gpio: GPIO_GET_LINEHANDLE_IOCTL: Reject invalid line flags

The GPIO_GET_LINEHANDLE_IOCTL currently ignores unknown or undefined
linehandle flags. From a backwards and forwards compatibility viewpoint it
is highly desirable to reject unknown flags though.

On one hand an application that is using newer flags and is running on
an older kernel has no way to detect if the new flags were handled
correctly if they are silently discarded.

On the other hand an application that (accidentally) passes undefined flags
will run fine on an older kernel, but may break on a newer kernel when
these flags get defined.

Ensure that requests that have undefined flags set are rejected with an
error, rather than silently discarding the undefined flags.
