greybus: improve data buffer alignment

For ES1 we need to insert the destination CPort id in whatever we
supply for sending over UniPro.  Currently we allocate one extra
byte supply the caller with an address that's offset by one from
the beginning of the allocated space.

As a result we always return a poorly-aligned buffer pointer.

Instead, allocate enough space so that we can return a better
aligned buffer to the caller.

Notes:
    - It may be that it's more important to supply an aligned
      address to the hardware.
    - We probably need to be more careful about writing into
      these buffers at unaligned offsets anyway.  (E.g., writing
      a 2-byte value at an odd offset can't be assumed to work.)
