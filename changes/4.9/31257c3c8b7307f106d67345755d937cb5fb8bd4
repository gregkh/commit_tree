torture: Convert torture_shutdown() to hrtimer

Upcoming changes to the timer wheel introduce significant inaccuracy
and possibly also an ultimate limit on timeout duration.  This is a
problem for the current implementation of torture_shutdown() because
(1) shutdown times are user-specified, and can therefore be quite long,
and (2) the torture scripting will kill a test instance that runs for
more than a few minutes longer than scheduled.  This commit therefore
converts the torture_shutdown() timed waits to an hrtimer, thus avoiding
too-short torture test runs as well as death by scripting.
