greybus: clarify device vs module

The Project ARA MDK states that a single module can have more than
one interface block (up to 2 at the moment).  An interface block
consists of two bidirectional UniPro lanes (along with power and
detect lines), and effectively represents a UniPro Device (with
an id in the range 0-127).

The service messages currently use "module_id" everywhere, even
though in a lot of cases we really need to be talking about device
ids.  The easiest case of this to see is the "set route" request
directed at a switch; a switch has no notion of modules, just
UniPro devices.
