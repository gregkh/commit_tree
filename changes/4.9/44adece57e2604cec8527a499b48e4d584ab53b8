drm/fb-helper: Add a dummy remove_conflicting_framebuffers

Lots of drivers don't properly compile without this when CONFIG_FB=n.
It's kinda a hack, but since CONFIG_FB doesn't stub any fucntions when
it's disabled I think it makes sense to add it to drm_fb_helper.h.

Long term we probably need to rethink all the logic to unload firmware
framebuffer drivers, at least if we want to be able to move away from
CONFIG_FB and fbcon.

v2: Unfortunately just stubbing out remove_conflicting_framebuffers in
drm_fb_helper.h upset gcc about static vs. non-static declarations, so
a new wrapper it needs to be. Means more churn :(
