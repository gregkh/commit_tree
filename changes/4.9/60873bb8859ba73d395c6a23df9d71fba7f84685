staging: lustre: at: net AT after connect

Once connected, the previously gathered AT statistics is not valid
anymore because may reflect other routing, etc. The connect by itself
could take a long time due to different reasons (e.g. server was not
ready) and net latency got very high (see import_select_connection())
what does not reflect the current situation.

Take into account only the current (re-)CONNECT rpc latency.
