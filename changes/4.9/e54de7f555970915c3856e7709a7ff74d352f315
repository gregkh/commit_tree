ASoC: tas571x: extend the t_i2c time to comply with TAS5721

TAS5721 datasheet recommends to wait at least 13.5ms after deasserting the
RESET signal. For TAS5717 this time is only 12ms, which was the original
value in the code.

Extend the wait time after deasserting RESET from 12 to 13.5ms to comply
with the TAS5721 specification.
