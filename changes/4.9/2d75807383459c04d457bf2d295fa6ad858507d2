mm: memcontrol: consolidate cgroup socket tracking

The cgroup core and the memory controller need to track socket ownership
for different purposes, but the tracking sites being entirely different
is kind of ugly.

Be a better citizen and rename the memory controller callbacks to match
the cgroup core callbacks, then move them to the same place.
