staging: lustre: ptlrpc: quiet errors on initial connection

It may be that a client or MDS is trying to connect to a target (OST
or peer MDT) before that target is finished setup. Rather than
spamming the console logs during initial connection, only print a
console error message if there are repeated failures trying to
connect to the target, which may indicate an error on that node.
