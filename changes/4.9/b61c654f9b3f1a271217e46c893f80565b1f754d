sctp: free msg->chunks when sctp_primitive_SEND return err

Last patch "sctp: do not return the transmit err back to sctp_sendmsg"
made sctp_primitive_SEND return err only when asoc state is unavailable.
In this case, chunks are not enqueued, they have no chance to be freed if
we don't take care of them later.

This Patch is actually to revert commit 1cd4d5c4326a ("sctp: remove the
unused sctp_datamsg_free()"), commit 69b5777f2e57 ("sctp: hold the chunks
only after the chunk is enqueued in outq") and commit 8b570dc9f7b6 ("sctp:
only drop the reference on the datamsg after sending a msg"), to use
sctp_datamsg_free to free the chunks of current msg.

Fixes: 8b570dc9f7b6 ("sctp: only drop the reference on the datamsg after sending a msg")
