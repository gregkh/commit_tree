sched/autogroup: Fix 64-bit kernel nice level adjustment

Because autogroup didn't call the then meaningless scale_load()...

Autogroup nice level adjustment has been broken ever since load
resolution was increased for 64-bit kernels.  Use scale_load() to
scale group weight.

Michael Kerrisk tested this patch to fix the problem:

> Applied and tested against 4.9-rc6 on an Intel u7 (4 cores).
> Test setup:
>
> Terminal window 1: running 40 CPU burner jobs
> Terminal window 2: running 40 CPU burner jobs
> Terminal window 1: running  1 CPU burner job
>
> Demonstrated that:
> * Writing "0" to the autogroup file for TW1 now causes no change
>   to the rate at which the process on the terminal consume CPU.
> * Writing -20 to the autogroup file for TW1 caused those processes
>   to get the lion's share of CPU while TW2 TW3 get a tiny amount.
> * Writing -20 to the autogroup files for TW1 and TW3 allowed the
>   process on TW3 to get as much CPU as it was getting as when
>   the autogroup nice values for both terminals were 0.
