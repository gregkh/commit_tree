greybus: hd: add bus_id attribute

The greybus host device id can only be read by parsing the uevent if one
wants to identify a specific host device 'or' bus. This is 'lsgb' uses
today.

This change adds a bus_id attribute so libraries can identify multiple
host devices 'or' bus if they exist.

Testing Done:
Tested on Arche,
'cat /sys/bus/greybus/devices/greysbus1/bus_id'
