perf intel-pt: Fix MTC timestamp calculation for large MTC periods

The MTC packet provides a 8-bit slice of CTC which is related to TSC by
the TMA packet, however the TMA packet only provides the lower 16 bits
of CTC.  If mtc_shift > 8 then some of the MTC bits are not in the CTC
provided by the TMA packet. Fix-up the last_mtc calculated from the TMA
packet by copying the missing bits from the current MTC assuming the
least difference between the two, and that the current MTC comes after
last_mtc.
