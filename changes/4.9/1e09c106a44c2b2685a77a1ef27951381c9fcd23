tlan: avoid unused label with PCI=n

While build testing with randconfig on x86, I ran into this warning
that appears to have been around forever

drivers/net/ethernet/ti/tlan.c: In function ‘tlan_probe1’:
drivers/net/ethernet/ti/tlan.c:614:1: error: label ‘err_out’ defined but not used [-Werror=unused-label]

This can be trivially avoided by just moving the label into the
existing #ifdef.
