staging: ks7010: ks_wlan_net: Use netdev_ instead of printk

The checkpatch.pl script found the following warning:

WARNING: printk() should include KERN_ facility level

After adding the KERN_ facility level to printk(), the script showed
another warning:

WARNING: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then
dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

The warning is similar for KERN_ERR and KERN_DEBUG. In conclusion,
use netdev_info(), netdev_err() or netdev_dbg() when there is
a netdev device.
