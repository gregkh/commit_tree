powerpc/xmon: Don't use ld on 32-bit

In commit 31cdd0c39c75 ("powerpc/xmon: Fix SPR read/write commands and
add command to dump SPRs") I added two uses of the "ld" instruction in
spr_access.S. "ld" is a 64-bit instruction, so shouldn't be used on
32-bit CPUs.

Replace it with PPC_LL which is a macro that gives us either "ld" or
"lwz" depending on whether we're 64 or 32-bit.
