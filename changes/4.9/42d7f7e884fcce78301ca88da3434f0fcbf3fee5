greybus: loopback: masked out threads should sleep

If a thread is masked out it should not consume CPU cycles during a test.
We set an arbitrary 100 millisecond sleep time for each masked out thread.
Reasonably blunt instrument to ensure threads with nothing to do don't end
up thrashing the acquisition/release of mutexes.
