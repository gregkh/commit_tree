netfilter: nf_ct_sip: correct parsing of continuation lines in SIP headers

Current parsing methods for SIP headers do not properly manage
continuation lines: in case of Call-ID header the first character of
Call-ID header value is truncated. As a result IPVS SIP persistence
engine hashes over a call-id that is not exactly the one present in
the originale message.

Example: "Call-ID: \r\n abcdeABCDE1234"
results in extracted call-id equal to "bcdeABCDE1234".

In above example Call-ID is represented as a string in C language.
Obviously in real message the first bytes after colon (":") are
"20 0d 0a 20".

Proposed fix is in nf_conntrack_sip module.
Since sip_follow_continuation() function walks past the leading
spaces or tabs of the continuation line, sip_skip_whitespace()
should simply return the ouput of sip_follow_continuation().
Otherwise another iteration of the for loop is done and dptr
is incremented by one pointing to the second character of the
first word in the header.

Below is an extract of relevant SIP ABNF syntax.

Call-ID  =  ( "Call-ID" / "i" ) HCOLON callid
callid   =  word [ "@" word ]

HCOLON  =  *( SP / HTAB ) ":" SWS
SWS     =  [LWS] ; sep whitespace
LWS     =  [*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP ; linear whitespace
WSP     =  SP / HTAB
word    =  1*(alphanum / "-" / "." / "!" / "%" / "*" /
           "_" / "+" / "`" / "'" / "~" /
           "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" /
           ":" / "\" / DQUOTE /
           "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" /
           "{" / "}" )
