arc: Implement arch-specific dma_map_ops.mmap

We used to use generic implementation of dma_map_ops.mmap which is
dma_common_mmap() but that only worked for simpler cached mappings when
vaddr = paddr.

If a driver requests uncached DMA buffer kernel maps it to virtual
address so that MMU gets involved and page uncached status takes into
account. In that case usage of dma_common_mmap() lead to mapping of
vaddr to vaddr for user-space which is obviously wrong. For more detals
please refer to verbose explanation here [1].

So here we implement our own version of mmap() which always deals
with dma_addr and maps underlying memory to user-space properly
(note that DMA buffer mapped to user-space is always uncached
because there's no way to properly manage cache from user-space).
