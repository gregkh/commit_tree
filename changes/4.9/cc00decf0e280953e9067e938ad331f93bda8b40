hwmon: (pmbus) Add explicit support for DPS-460, DPS-800, and SGD009

Provide support for PSU DPS-460, DPS-800 from Delta Electronics, INC
and for SGD009 from Acbel Polytech, INC.

These devices do not support the STATUS_CML register, and reports a
communication error in response to this command. For this reason,
the status register check is disabled for these controllers.
