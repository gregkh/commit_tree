parisc: Increase KERNEL_INITIAL_SIZE for 32-bit SMP kernels

Increase the initial kernel default page mapping size for SMP kernels to 32MB
and add a runtime check which panics early if the kernel is bigger than the
initial mapping size.

This fixes boot crashes of 32bit SMP kernels. Due to the introduction of huge
page support in kernel 4.4 and it's required initial kernel layout in memory, a
32bit SMP kernel usually got bigger (in layout, not size) than 16MB.
