coresight: etmv4: Fix ETMv4x peripheral ID table

This patch cleans up the peripheral id table for different ETMv4
implementations.

As per Cortex-A53 TRM, the ETM has following id values:

Peripheral ID0	0x5D	0xFE0
Peripheral ID1	0xB9	0xFE4
Peripheral ID2	0x4B	0xFE8
Peripheral ID3	0x00	0xFEC

where, PID2: has the following format:

[7:4]   Revision
[3]     JEDEC   0b1     res1. Indicates a JEP106 identity code is used
[2:0]   DES_1   0b011   ARM Limited. This is bits[6:4] of JEP106 ID code

The existing table entry checks only the bits [1:0], which is not
sufficient enough. Fix it to match bits [3:0], just like the other
entries do. While at it, correct the comment for A57 and the A53 entry.
