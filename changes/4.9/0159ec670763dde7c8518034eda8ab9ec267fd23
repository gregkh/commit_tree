PM / Domains: Verify the PM domain is present when adding a provider

When a PM domain provider is added, there is currently no way to tell if
any PM domains associated with the provider are present. Naturally, the
PM domain provider should not be registered if the PM domains have not
been added. Nonetheless, verify that the PM domain(s) associated with a
provider are present when registering the PM domain provider.

This change adds a dependency on the function pm_genpd_present() when
CONFIG_PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS_OF is enabled and so ensure this function is
available when CONFIG_PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS_OF selected.
