printk: make reading the kernel log flush pending lines

That will mean that any possible subsequent continuation will now be
broken up onto a line of its own (since reading the log has finalized
the beginning og the line), but if user space has activated system
logging (or if there's a kernel message dump going on) that is the right
thing to do.

And now that we actually get the continuation flags _right_ for this
all, the user space logger that is reading the kernel messages can
actually see the continuation marker.  Not that anybody seems to really
bother with it (or care), but in theory user space can do its own
message stitching.
