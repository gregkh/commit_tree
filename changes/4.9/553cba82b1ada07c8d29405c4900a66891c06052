greybus: control: Print bundle-id in print messages

The new power management specific operations added to the control
protocol do not print the bundle-id in the error messages and it is not
possible to identify which bundle-id the operation failed for.

Fix that and do minor rewriting of the print messages to make them more
readable.

Tested on EVT 2.0 with gpbridge-test module.
