min/max: remove sparse warnings when they're nested

Currently, when min/max are nested within themselves, sparse will warn:

    warning: symbol '_min1' shadows an earlier one
    originally declared here
    warning: symbol '_min1' shadows an earlier one
    originally declared here
    warning: symbol '_min2' shadows an earlier one
    originally declared here

This also immediately happens when min3() or max3() are used.

Since sparse implements __COUNTER__, we can use __UNIQUE_ID() to
generate unique variable names, avoiding this.
