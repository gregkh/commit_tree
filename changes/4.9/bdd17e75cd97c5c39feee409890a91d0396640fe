blk-mq: only allocate a single mq_map per tag_set

The mapping is identical for all queues in a tag_set, so stop wasting
memory for building multiple.  Note that for now I've kept the mq_map
pointer in the request_queue, but we'll need to investigate if we can
remove it without suffering too much from the additional pointer chasing.
The same would apply to the mq_ops pointer as well.
