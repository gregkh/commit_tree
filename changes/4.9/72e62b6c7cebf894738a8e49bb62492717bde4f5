staging: lustre: lnet: Stop Infinite CON RACE Condition

In current code, when a CON RACE occurs, the passive side will
let the node with the higher NID value win the race.

We have a field case where a node can have a "stuck"
connection which never goes away and is the trigger of a
never-ending loop of re-connections.

This patch introduces a counter to how many times a
connection in a connecting state has been the cause of a CON RACE
rejection. After 20 times (constant MAX_CONN_RACES_BEFORE_ABORT),
we assume the connection is stuck and let the other side (with
lower NID) win.
