ACPI / LPSS: Provide build-in properties of the UART

The UART driver, dw8250.c, needs some details regarding the
Designware UART. For ACPI enumerated devices the values are
hard-coded, but since the driver also reads the values from
device properties, providing them with build-in properties.
This allows us to later remove the hard-coded values from
the driver.
