tcp: cdg: rename struct minmax in tcp_cdg.c to avoid a naming conflict

The upcoming change "lib/win_minmax: windowed min or max estimator"
introduces a struct called minmax, which is then included in
include/linux/tcp.h in the upcoming change "tcp: use windowed min
filter library for TCP min_rtt estimation". This would create a
compilation error for tcp_cdg.c, which defines its own minmax
struct. To avoid this naming conflict (and potentially others in the
future), this commit renames the version used in tcp_cdg.c to
cdg_minmax.
