iwlwifi: pcie: Set affinity mask for rx interrupt vectors per cpu

In order to utilize the host's CPUs in the most efficient way
we bind each rx interrupt vector to each CPU on the host.
Each rx interrupt is prioritized to execute only on the designated CPU
rather than any CPU.
Processor affinity takes advantage of the fact that some remnants of
a process that was run on a given processor may remain in that
processor's memory state for example, data in the CPU cache after
another process is run on that CPU. Scheduling that process to execute
on the same processor could result in an efficient use of process by
reducing performance-degrading situations such as cache misses
and parallel processing.
