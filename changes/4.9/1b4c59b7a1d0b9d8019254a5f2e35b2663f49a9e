target: fix potential race window in target_sess_cmd_list_waiting()

target_sess_cmd_list_waiting() might hit on a condition where
the kref for the command is already 0, but the destructor has
not been called yet (or is stuck in waiting for a spin lock).
Rather than leaving the command on the list we should explicitly
remove it to avoid race issues later on.
