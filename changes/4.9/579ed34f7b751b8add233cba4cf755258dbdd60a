RAID10: ignore discard error

This is the counterpart of raid10 fix. If a write error occurs, raid10
will try to rewrite the bio in small chunk size. If the rewrite fails,
raid10 will record the error in bad block. narrow_write_error will
always use WRITE for the bio, but actually it could be a discard. Since
discard bio hasn't payload, write the bio will cause different issues.
But discard error isn't fatal, we can safely ignore it. This is what
this patch does.

This issue should exist since discard is added, but only exposed with
recent arbitrary bio size feature.
