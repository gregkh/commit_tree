drm/i915: Track display alignment on VMA

When using the aliasing ppgtt and pageflipping with the shrinker/eviction
active, we note that we often have to rebind the backbuffer before
flipping onto the scanout because it has an invalid alignment. If we
store the worst-case alignment required for a VMA, we can avoid having
to rebind at critical junctures.
