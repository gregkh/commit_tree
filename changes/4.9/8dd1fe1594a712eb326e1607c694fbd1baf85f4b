i2c: export i2c_adapter_depth()

For crazy setups in which an i2c gpio expander is behind an i2c gpio
multiplexer controlled by a gpio provided a second expander using the
same device driver we need to explicitly tell lockdep how to handle
nested locking.

Export i2c_adapter_depth() as public API to be reused outside of i2c
core code.
