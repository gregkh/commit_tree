ARM: dts: fix RealView EB SMSC ethernet version

The ethernet version in the earlier RealView EB variants is
LAN91C111 and not LAN9118 according to ARM DUI 0303E
"RealView Emulation Baseboard User Guide" page 3-57.

Make sure that this is used for the base variant of the board.

As the DT bindings for LAN91C111 does not specify any power
supplies, these need to be deleted from the DTS file.
