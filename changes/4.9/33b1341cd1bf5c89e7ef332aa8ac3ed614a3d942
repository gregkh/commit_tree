mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix handling of neighbour structure

__neigh_create function works in a different way than assumed.
It passes "n" as a parameter to ndo_neigh_construct. But this "n" might
be destroyed right away before __neigh_create() returns in case there is
already another neighbour struct in the hashtable with the same dev and
primary key. That is not expected by mlxsw_sp_router_neigh_construct()
and the stored "n" points to freed memory, eventually leading to crash.

Fix this by doing tight 1:1 coupling between neighbour struct and
internal driver neigh_entry. That allows to narrow down the key in
internal driver hashtable to do lookups by "n" only.
