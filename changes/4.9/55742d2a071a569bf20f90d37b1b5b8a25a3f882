greybus: interface: implement generic mode-switch functionality

Add a generic interface for bundle drivers to use to request that a
mode switch is carried out on its behalf.

Mode switching involves tearing down all connections to an interface,
sending a unidirectional mode-switch request, and waiting for a mailbox
event that triggers deferred control connection reset and re-enumeration
of the interface. In case of a timeout waiting for the interface mailbox
event, or on other errors, the interface is powered off.

All of this needs to be done by core from work-queue context in order
not to block incoming SVC requests and bundle-device tear down. Care
must also be taken to serialise against concurrent module removal events
and eject requests.

Special handling of legacy mode-switching is also added in order to
continue to support the ES3 bootrom.
