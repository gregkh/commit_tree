serial: xuartps: Do not enable parity error interrupt

The patch makes changes not to enable parity error interrupt.
With the current implementation, each parity error results in
two distinct interrupts (almost always). The first one is normal
parity error interrupt with no data in the fifo and the second one
is a proper Rx interrupt with the received data in the fifo. By
disabling parity error interrupt we still ensure handling of
parity errors as for the Rx fifo interrupt the parity error still
shows up in the interrupt status register. Considering the fact
that the by default INPCK and IGNPAR are not set, this is the
optimal implementation for parity error handling.
