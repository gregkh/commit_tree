bpf: enable event output helper also for xdp types

Follow-up to 555c8a8623a3 ("bpf: avoid stack copy and use skb ctx for
event output") for also adding the event output helper for XDP typed
programs. The event output helper has been very useful in particular for
debugging or event notification purposes, since it's much faster and
flexible than regular trace printk due to programmatically being able to
attach meta data. Same flags structure applies as with tc BPF programs.
