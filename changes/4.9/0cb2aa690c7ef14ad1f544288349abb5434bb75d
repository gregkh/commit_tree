IB/hfi1: Add sysfs interface for affinity setup

Some users want more control over which cpu cores are being used by the
driver. For example, users might want to restrict the driver to some
specified subset of the cores so that they can appropriately partition
processes, irq handlers, and work threads.
To allow the user to fine tune system affinity settings new sysfs
attributes are introduced per sdma engine.  This patch adds a new
attribute type for sdma engine and a new cpu_list attribute.
When the user writes a cpu range to the cpu_list attribute the driver
will create an internal cpu->sdma map, which will be used later as a
look-up table to choose an optimal engine for a user requests.
