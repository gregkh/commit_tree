ARM: 8602/1: factor out CSSELR/CCSIDR operations that use cp15 directly

Currently we use raw cp15 operations to access the cache setup data.

This patch abstracts the CSSELR and CCSIDR accessors out to a header so
that the implementation for them can be switched out as we do with other
cpu/cachetype operations.
