drm/i915: Allow the user to pass a context to any ring

With full-ppgtt, we want the user to have full control over their memory
layout, with a separate instance per context. Forcing them to use a
shared memory layout for !RCS not only duplicates the amount of work we
have to do, but also defeats the memory segregation on offer.
