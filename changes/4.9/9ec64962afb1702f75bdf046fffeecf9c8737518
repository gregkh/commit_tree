ubifs: Implement RENAME_EXCHANGE

Adds RENAME_EXCHANGE to UBIFS, the operation itself
is completely disjunct from a regular rename() that's
why we dispatch very early in ubifs_reaname().

RENAME_EXCHANGE used by the renameat2() system call
allows the caller to exchange two paths atomically.
Both paths have to exist and have to be on the same
filesystem.
