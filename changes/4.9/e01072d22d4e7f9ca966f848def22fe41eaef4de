cpufreq: ti: Use generic platdev driver

Now that the cpufreq-dt-platdev is used to create the cpufreq-dt platform
device for all OMAP platforms and the platform code that did it
before has been removed, add ti,am33xx and ti,dra7xx to the machine list
in cpufreq-dt-platdev which had relied on the removed platform code to do
this previously.
