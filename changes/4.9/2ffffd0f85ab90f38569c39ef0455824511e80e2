drm/i915: Fix up vma alignment to be u64

This is not the full fix, as we are required to percolate the u64 nature
down through the drm_mm stack, but this is required now to prevent
explosions due to mismatch between execbuf (eb_vma_misplaced) and vma
binding (i915_vma_misplaced) - and reduces the risk of spurious changes
as we adjust the vma interface in the next patches.

v2: long long casts not required for u64 printk (%llx)
