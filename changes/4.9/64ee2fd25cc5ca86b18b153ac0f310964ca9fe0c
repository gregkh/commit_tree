drm/i915: Avoid mixing up SST and MST in DDI setup

The MST vs. SST selection should depend purely on the choice of the
connector/encoder. So don't try to determine the correct DDI mode
based on the intel_dp->is_mst, which simply tells us whether the sink
is in MST mode or not. Instead derive the information from the encoder
type. Since the link training code deals in non-fake encoders, we'll
also need to keep a second copy of that information around, which we'll
now designate as 'link_mst'.
