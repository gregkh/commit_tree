fanotify: use notification_lock instead of access_lock

Fanotify code has its own lock (access_lock) to protect a list of events
waiting for a response from userspace.

However this is somewhat awkward as the same list_head in the event is
protected by notification_lock if it is part of the notification queue
and by access_lock if it is part of the fanotify private queue which
makes it difficult for any reliable checks in the generic code.  So make
fanotify use the same lock - notification_lock - for protecting its
private event list.
