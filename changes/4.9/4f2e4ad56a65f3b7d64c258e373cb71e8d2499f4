net: mangle zero checksum in skb_checksum_help()

Sending zero checksum is ok for TCP, but not for UDP.

UDPv6 receiver should by default drop a frame with a 0 checksum,
and UDPv4 would not verify the checksum and might accept a corrupted
packet.

Simply replace such checksum by 0xffff, regardless of transport.

This error was caught on SIT tunnels, but seems generic.
