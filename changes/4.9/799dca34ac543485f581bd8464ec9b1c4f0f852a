UBI: hide EBA internals

Create a private ubi_eba_table struct to hide EBA internals and provide
helpers to allocate, destroy, copy and assing an EBA table to a volume.

Now that external EBA users are using helpers to query/modify the EBA
state we can safely change the internal representation, which will be
needed to support the LEB consolidation concept.
