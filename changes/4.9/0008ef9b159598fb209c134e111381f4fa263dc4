MIPS: Lantiq: Make vmmc explicitly non-modular

The Makefile entry controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/mips/lantiq/xway/vmmc.o
   ---> arch/mips/lantiq/xway/Makefile:obj-y += vmmc.o

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We replace module.h with export.h since the file does actually use
EXPORT_SYMBOL.
