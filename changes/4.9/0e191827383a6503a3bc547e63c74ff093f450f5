qed*: Reduce the memory footprint for Rx path

With the current default values for Rx path i.e., 8 queues of 8Kb entries
each with 4Kb size, interface will consume 256Mb for Rx. The default values
causing the driver probe to fail when the system memory is low. Based on
the perforamnce results, rx-ring count value of 1Kb gives the comparable
performance with Rx coalesce timeout of 12 seconds. Updating the default
values.
