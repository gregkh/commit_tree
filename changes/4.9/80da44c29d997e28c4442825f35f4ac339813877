crypto: vmx - Fix memory corruption caused by p8_ghash

This patch changes the p8_ghash driver to use ghash-generic as a fixed
fallback implementation. This allows the correct value of descsize to be
defined directly in its shash_alg structure and avoids problems with
incorrect buffer sizes when its state is exported or imported.
