i2c: designware: Avoid aborted transfers with fast reacting I2C slaves

I2C DesignWare may abort transfer with arbitration lost if I2C slave pulls
SDA down quickly after falling edge of SCL. Reason for this is unknown but
after trial and error it was found this can be avoided by enabling non-zero
SDA RX hold time for the receiver.

By the specification SDA RX hold time extends incoming SDA low to high
transition by n * ic_clk cycles but only when SCL is high. However it
seems to help avoid above faulty arbitration lost error.

Bits 23:16 in IC_SDA_HOLD register define the SDA RX hold time for the
receiver. Be conservative and enable 1 ic_clk cycle long hold time in
case boot firmware hasn't set it up.
