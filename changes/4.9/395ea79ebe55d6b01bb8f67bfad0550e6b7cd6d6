arm64: KVM: Handle async aborts delivered while at EL2

If EL1 generates an asynchronous abort and then traps into EL2
before the abort has been delivered, we may end-up with the
abort firing at the worse possible place: on the host.

In order to avoid this, it is necessary to take the abort at EL2,
by clearing the PSTATE.A bit. In order to survive this abort,
we do it at a point where we're in a known state with respect
to the world switch, and handle the resulting exception,
overloading the exit code in the process.
