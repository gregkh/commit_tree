latent_entropy: Fix wrong gcc code generation with 64 bit variables

The stack frame size could grow too large when the plugin used long long
on 32-bit architectures when the given function had too many basic blocks.

The gcc warning was:

drivers/pci/hotplug/ibmphp_ebda.c: In function 'ibmphp_access_ebda':
drivers/pci/hotplug/ibmphp_ebda.c:409:1: warning: the frame size of 1108 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

This switches latent_entropy from u64 to unsigned long.

Thanks to PaX Team and Emese Revfy for the patch.
