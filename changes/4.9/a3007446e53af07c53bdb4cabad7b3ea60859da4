sctp: fix the handling of SACK Gap Ack blocks

sctp_acked() is using 32bit arithmetics on 16bits vars, via TSN_lte()
macros, which is weird and confusing.

Once the offset to ctsn is calculated, all wrapping is already handled
and thus to verify the Gap Ack blocks we can just use pure
less/big-or-equal than checks.

Also, rename gap variable to tsn_offset, so it's more meaningful, as
it doesn't point to any gap at all.

Even so, I don't think this discrepancy resulted in any practical bug.

This patch is a preparation for the next one, which will introduce
typecheck() for TSN_lte() macros and would cause a compile error here.
