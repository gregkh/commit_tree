gpio: pca953x: code shrink

There are multiple places in the driver code where a
switch (chip->chip_type) is used to determine the proper register
offset.

Unduplicate the code by adding a simple structure holding the possible
offsets that differ between the pca953x and pca957x chip families and
use it to avoid the checks.
