pstore/pmsg: drop bounce buffer

Removing a bounce buffer copy operation in the pmsg driver path is
always better. We also gain in overall performance by not requesting
a vmalloc on every write as this can cause precious RT tasks, such
as user facing media operation, to stall while memory is being
reclaimed. Added a write_buf_user to the pstore functions, a backup
platform write_buf_user that uses the small buffer that is part of
the instance, and implemented a ramoops write_buf_user that only
supports PSTORE_TYPE_PMSG.
