linux/mm.h: canonicalize macro PAGE_ALIGNED() definition

The macro PAGE_ALIGNED() is prone to cause error because it doesn't
follow convention to parenthesize parameter @addr within macro body, for
example unsigned long *ptr = kmalloc(...); PAGE_ALIGNED(ptr + 16); for
the left parameter of macro IS_ALIGNED(), (unsigned long)(ptr + 16) is
desired but the actual one is (unsigned long)ptr + 16.

It is fixed by simply canonicalizing macro PAGE_ALIGNED() definition.
