gpio: do not double-check direction on sleeping chips

When locking a GPIO line as IRQ, we go to lengths to
double-check that the line is really set as input before
marking it as used for IRQ. This is not good on GPIO chips
that can sleep, because this function is called in IRQ-safe
context. Just skip this if it can't be checked quickly.

Currently this happens on sleeping expanders such as STMPE
or TC3589x:

BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0x00000002

(...)

This patch fixes that problem and relies on the direction
read from the chip when it was added.
