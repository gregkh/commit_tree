staging: fsl-mc: make order of includes consistent

There are 3 kinds of headers included in the bus driver components--
misc linux/include files, public bus driver includes, and includes
private to the bus driver.

Cleanup the order and formatting of includes in the bus driver to be
consistent:
    #include <linux/include/[file].h>
    #include ../include/[file].h  // public bus driver includes (eventually
                                  // destined for: linux/include/fsl)
    [blank line]
    #include "[file].h"           // private bus driver includes
