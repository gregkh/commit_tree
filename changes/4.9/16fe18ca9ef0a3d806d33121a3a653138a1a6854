greybus: arche-platform: Assert wake/detect after SVC reset without delay

Since now driver supports interrupt based mechanism to read events
from SVC over wake/detect line, no need to delay wake/detect assertion.
We can assert wake/detect after SVC reset deassertion, so during boot
itself SVC will start sending wake_out pulses.

Testing Done: Tested on DB3.5 platform.
