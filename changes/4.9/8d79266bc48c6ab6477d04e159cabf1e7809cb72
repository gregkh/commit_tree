ip6_tunnel: add collect_md mode to IPv6 tunnels

Similar to gre, vxlan, geneve tunnels allow IPIP6 and IP6IP6 tunnels
to operate in 'collect metadata' mode.
Unlike ipv4 code here it's possible to reuse ip6_tnl_xmit() function
for both collect_md and traditional tunnels.
bpf_skb_[gs]et_tunnel_key() helpers and ovs (in the future) are the users.
