ARM: S3C24XX: Specify audio codec platform_data for mini2440 board

The L3 bus GPIOs are specified in the board file rather than through
the sound card's device platform_data. This allows to ensure the codec
driver doesn't get probed with uninitialized platform_data field of
its corresponding platform device.
