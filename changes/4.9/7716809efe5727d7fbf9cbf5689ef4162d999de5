IB/hns: Add phy_port for computing GSI/QPN

This patch mainly adds phy_port to HNS RoCE QP. This shall be
used in calculating the GSI QPN for the port.
Initally when RDMA is being established, all IB ports share a
QPN which later needs to be re-assigned to a particular GSI/QPN
and which is per-port.
This also fixes a bug in base driver where iboe port was being
used instead of phy_port at some places. This values might not
be same always.
