KVM: MIPS: Fix lazy user ASID regenerate for SMP

kvm_mips_check_asids() runs before entering the guest and performs lazy
regeneration of host ASID for guest usermode, using last_user_gasid to
track the last guest ASID in the VCPU that was used by guest usermode on
any host CPU.

last_user_gasid is reset after performing the lazy ASID regeneration on
the current CPU, and by kvm_arch_vcpu_load() if the host ASID for guest
usermode is regenerated due to staleness (to cancel outstanding lazy
ASID regenerations). Unfortunately neither case handles SMP hosts
correctly:

 - When the lazy ASID regeneration is performed it should apply to all
   CPUs (as last_user_gasid does), so reset the ASID on other CPUs to
   zero to trigger regeneration when the VCPU is next loaded on those
   CPUs.

 - When the ASID is found to be stale on the current CPU, we should not
   cancel lazy ASID regenerations globally, so drop the reset of
   last_user_gasid altogether here.

Both cases would require a guest ASID change and two host CPU migrations
(and in the latter case one of the CPUs to start a new ASID cycle)
before guest usermode could potentially access stale user pages from a
previously running ASID in the same VCPU.
