drm/i915: Add a sw fence for collecting up dma fences

This is really a core kernel struct in disguise until we can finally
place it in kernel/. There is an immediate need for a fence collection
mechanism that is more flexible than fence-array, in particular being
able to easily drive request submission via events (and not just
interrupt driven). The same mechanism would be useful for handling
nonblocking and asynchronous atomic modesets, parallel execution and
more, but for the time being just create a local sw fence for execbuf.
