genetlink: fix a memory leak on error path

In __genl_register_family(), when genl_validate_assign_mc_groups()
fails, we forget to free the memory we possibly allocate for
family->attrbuf.

Note, some callers call genl_unregister_family() to clean up
on error path, it doesn't work because the family is inserted
to the global list in the nearly last step.
