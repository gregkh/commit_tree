drm/i915: Introduce i915_gem_active for request tracking

In the next patch, request tracking is made more generic and for that we
need a new expanded struct and to separate out the logic changes from
the mechanical churn, we split out the structure renaming into this
patch.

v2: Writer's block. Add some spiel about why we track requests.
v3: Now i915_gem_active.
v4: Now with i915_gem_active_set() for attaching to the active request.
v5: Use i915_gem_active_set() from inside the retirement handlers
