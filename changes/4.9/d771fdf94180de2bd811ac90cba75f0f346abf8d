pstore/ram: Use memcpy_fromio() to save old buffer

The ramoops buffer may be mapped as either I/O memory or uncached
memory.  On ARM64, this results in a device-type (strongly-ordered)
mapping.  Since unnaligned accesses to device-type memory will
generate an alignment fault (regardless of whether or not strict
alignment checking is enabled), it is not safe to use memcpy().
memcpy_fromio() is guaranteed to only use aligned accesses, so use
that instead.
