drm/i915: Choose not to evict faultable objects from the GGTT

Often times we do not want to evict mapped objects from the GGTT as
these are quite expensive to teardown and frequently reused (causing an
equally, if not more so, expensive setup). In particular, when faulting
in a new object we want to avoid evicting an active object, or else we
may trigger a page-fault-of-doom as we ping-pong between evicting two
objects.
