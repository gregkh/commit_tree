greybus: arche-platform: bring SVC out of reset later in probe

Move SVC deassert reset to after wake-detect pin has been pulled
low in probe.  Otherwise, SVC may trigger WAKE_OUT based on a
default high signal.

Testing Done:
- Used for DB3.5/EVT1.5 hardware during bringup
- Regression tested on DB3.1+ES2, DB3.1+ES3
