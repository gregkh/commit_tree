lightnvm: control life of nvm_dev in driver

LightNVM compatible device drivers does not have a method to expose
LightNVM specific sysfs entries.

To enable LightNVM sysfs entries to be exposed, lightnvm device
drivers require a struct device to attach it to. To allow both the
actual device driver and lightnvm sysfs entries to coexist, the device
driver tracks the lifetime of the nvm_dev structure.

This patch refactors NVMe and null_blk to handle the lifetime of struct
nvm_dev, which eliminates the need for struct gendisk when a lightnvm
compatible device is provided.
