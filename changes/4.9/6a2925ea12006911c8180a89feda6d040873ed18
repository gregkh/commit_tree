drm/i2c: tda998x: don't register the connector

The connector shouldn't be registered until the rest of the whole device
is set up, so that consistent state is presented to userspace.

As drm_dev_register() now registers all of the connectors anyway,
there's no need to explicitly do it in individual drivers so remove
the calls to drm_connector_register()/drm_connector_unregister().

This allows componentised drivers to use tda998x without having racy
initialisation.
