greybus: es1/es2: set transfer flag to send a zero-length packet

Greybus messages with a multiple size of 512B generate timeouts
(any other message size doesn't).
512B is exactly the packet size of a bulk out endpoint.
Hence USB device is expecting a short (< 512B)
or zero-length packet to finish the transfer,
which is never generated and causes the timeout.

Set the transfer flag to send a zero-length packet in this situation.
