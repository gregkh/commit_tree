KVM: arm/arm64: Get rid of exported aliases to static functions

When rewriting the assembly code to C code, it was useful to have
exported aliases or static functions so that we could keep the existing
common C code unmodified and at the same time rewrite arm64 from
assembly to C code, and later do the arm part.

Now when both are done, we really don't need this level of indirection
anymore, and it's time to save a few lines and brain cells.
