clk: Simplify __of_clk_get_hw_from_provider()

__of_clk_get_hw_from_provider() is confusing because it will
return EPROBE_DEFER if there isn't a ->get() or ->get_hw()
function pointer in a provider. That's just a bug though, and we
used to NULL pointer exception when ->get() was missing anyway,
so let's make this more obvious that they're not optional. The
assumption is that most providers will implement ->get_hw() so we
only fallback to the ->get() function if necessary. This
clarifies the intent and removes any possibility of probe defer
happening if clk providers are buggy.
