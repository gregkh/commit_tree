MIPS: smp.c: Introduce mechanism for freeing and allocating IPIs

For the MIPS remote processor implementation, we need additional IPIs to
talk to the remote processor. Since MIPS GIC reserves exactly the right
number of IPI IRQs required by Linux for the number of VPs in the
system, this is not possible without releasing some recources.

This commit introduces mips_smp_ipi_allocate() which allocates IPIs to a
given cpumask. It is called as normal with the cpu_possible_mask at
bootup to initialise IPIs to all CPUs. mips_smp_ipi_free() may then be
used to free IPIs to a subset of those CPUs so that their hardware
resources can be reused.
