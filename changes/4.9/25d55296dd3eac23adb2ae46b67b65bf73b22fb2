svcrdma: support Remote Invalidation

Support Remote Invalidation. A private message is exchanged with
the client upon RDMA transport connect that indicates whether
Send With Invalidation may be used by the server to send RPC
replies. The invalidate_rkey is arbitrarily chosen from among
rkeys present in the RPC-over-RDMA header's chunk lists.

Send With Invalidate improves performance only when clients can
recognize, while processing an RPC reply, that an rkey has already
been invalidated. That has been submitted as a separate change.

In the future, the RPC-over-RDMA protocol might support Remote
Invalidation properly. The protocol needs to enable signaling
between peers to indicate when Remote Invalidation can be used
for each individual RPC.
