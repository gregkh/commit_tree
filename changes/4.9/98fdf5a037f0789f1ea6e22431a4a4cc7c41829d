greybus: core: defer connection creation to driver probe

Defer connection creation to bundle driver probe instead of creating
them when initialising the interface and parsing the manifest.

Store copies of the CPorts descriptors in the bundle for the drivers to
use, and update the legacy driver.

This is needed for drivers that need more control over host-device
resource management, for example, when a protocol needs to use a
dedicated host CPort for traffic offloading (e.g. camera data).

This also avoids allocating host CPorts for bundles that are not bound
to a driver or for remote CPorts that a driver does not need.
