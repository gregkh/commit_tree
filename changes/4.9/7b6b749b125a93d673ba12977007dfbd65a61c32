UBI: move the global ech and vidh variables into struct ubi_attach_info

Even if it works fine with those global variables, attaching the
temporary ech and vidh objects used during UBI scan to the
ubi_attach_info object sounds like a more future-proof option.

For example, attaching several UBI devices in parallel is prevented by
this use of global variable. And also because global variables should
be avoided in general.
