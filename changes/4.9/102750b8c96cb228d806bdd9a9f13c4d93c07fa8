HID: kye: Rename MousePen i608X v2 macro

Rename the device ID macro for the second version of KYE MousePen i608x
graphics tablet to have "V" in its name to signify that "2" is a
version.

I.e. USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X_2 ->
     USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X_V2

This also makes applying additional fixes from DIGImend easier.
