null_blk: refactor to support non-gendisk devices

With LightNVM enabled devices, the gendisk structure is not exposed
to the user. This hides the device driver specific sysfs entries, and
prevents binding of LightNVM geometry information to the device.

Refactor the device registration process, so that gendisk and
non-gendisk devices are easily managed.
