tick/nohz: Prevent stopping the tick on an offline CPU

can_stop_full_tick() has no check for offline cpus. So it allows to stop
the tick on an offline cpu from the interrupt return path, which is wrong
and subsequently makes irq_work_needs_cpu() warn about being called for an
offline cpu.

Commit f7ea0fd639c2c4 ("tick: Don't invoke tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() if
the cpu is offline") added prevention for can_stop_idle_tick(), but forgot
to do the same in can_stop_full_tick(). Add it.
