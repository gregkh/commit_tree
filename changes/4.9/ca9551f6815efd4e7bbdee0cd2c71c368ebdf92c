greybus: timesync: Printout strobe count on sync failure

If we failed to synchronize the FrameTime it would be useful to know how
many of the expected strobes arrived, for example a value of 0/5 would
indicate the SVC was completely dead but a value of 4/5 would indicate one
GPIO pulse got lost i.e. the AP was too slow reacting to an interrupt and
completely missed one of the strobe events. In either case the actual
number of strobes is a useful thing to print out.
