mlxsw: spectrum: Fix refcount bug on span entries

When binding port to a newly created span entry, its refcount is
initialized to zero even though it has a bound port. That leads
to unexpected behaviour when the user tries to delete that port
from the span entry.

Fix this by initializing the reference count to 1.

Also add a warning to put function.
