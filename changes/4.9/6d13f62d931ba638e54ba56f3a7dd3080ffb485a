ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Always acquire runtime pm ref on unload

skl_probe() releases a runtime pm ref unconditionally wheras
skl_remove() acquires one only if the device is wakeup capable.
Thus if the device is not wakeup capable, unloading and reloading
the module will result in the refcount being decreased below 0.
Fix it.
