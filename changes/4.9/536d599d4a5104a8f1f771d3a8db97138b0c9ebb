usb: musb: Add missing pm_runtime_disable and drop 2430 PM timeout

We are missing pm_runtime_disable() in 2430 glue layer. Further,
we only need to enable PM runtime and disable it on exit. With
musb_core.c doing PM, the glue layer as a parent will always be
active when musb_core.c is active.

This fixes host enumeration issues with some devices as reported
by Ladislav Michl <ladis@linux-mips.org>.

And holding an RPM reference while deregistering the child would
lead to a crash in omap2430_runtime_suspend() which dereferences
the now freed child's driver data on put as pointed out by
Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>:

Note that if changes are needed to the autosuspend timeout, it should
be done in musb_core.c.
