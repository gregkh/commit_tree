scripts/has-stack-protector: add -fno-PIE

Adding -no-PIE to the fstack protector check. -no-PIE was introduced
before -fstack-protector so there is no need for a runtime check.

Without it the build stops:
|Cannot use CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG: -fstack-protector-strong available but compiler is broken

due to -mcmodel=kernel + -fPIE if -fPIE is enabled by default.

Tagging it stable so it is possible to compile recent stable kernels as
well.
