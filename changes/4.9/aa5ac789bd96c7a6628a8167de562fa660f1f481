m68k: generalize uboot command line support

The uboot command line support needs to be used by both MMU and no-MMU
setups, but currently we only have the code in the no-MMU code paths.
Move the uboot command line processing code into its own file. Add
appropriate calls to it from both the MMU and no-MMU arch setup code.
