i2c: imx: make bus recovery through pinctrl optional

Since commit 1c4b6c3bcf30 ("i2c: imx: implement bus recovery") the
driver starts to use gpio/pinctrl to support optional bus recovery
feature.  But pinctrl is not always usable.  There are platforms such
as ls1021a and ls1043a that don't support pinctrl, and it could just
be broken due to old/broken device tree.  The patch makes it really
optional that the probe function won't bailout on pinctrl problems
instead it just disables bus recovery and prints out notification when
there is problem with pinctrl.  Since pinctrl is only used by bus
recovery in this driver, move pinctrl initialization into bus recovery
init function to prevent confusion.
