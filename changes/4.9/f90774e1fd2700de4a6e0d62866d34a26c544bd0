checkpatch: look for symbolic permissions and suggest octal instead

S_<FOO> uses should be avoided where octal is more intelligible.

Linus didst say:

: It's *much* easier to parse and understand the octal numbers, while the
: symbolic macro names are just random line noise and hard as hell to
: understand.  You really have to think about it.
:
: So we should rather go the other way: convert existing bad symbolic
: permission bit macro use to just use the octal numbers.
:
: The symbolic names are good for the *other* bits (ie sticky bit, and the
: inode mode _type_ numbers etc), but for the permission bits, the symbolic
: names are just insane crap.  Nobody sane should ever use them.  Not in the
: kernel, not in user space.
