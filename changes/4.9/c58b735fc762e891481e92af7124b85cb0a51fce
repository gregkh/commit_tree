drm/i915: Allocate rings from stolen

If we have stolen available, make use of it for ringbuffer allocation.
Previously this was restricted to !llc platforms, as writing to stolen
requires a GGTT mapping - but now that we have partial mappable support,
the mappable aperture isn't quite so precious so we can use it more
freely and ringbuffers are a good user for the otherwise wasted stolen.
