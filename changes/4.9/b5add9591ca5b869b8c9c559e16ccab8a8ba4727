drm/i915: Make fb_tracking.lock a spinlock

We only need a very lightweight mechanism here as the locking is only
used for co-ordinating a bitfield.

v2: Move the cheap unlikely tests into the caller
v3: Move the kerneldoc into the header (now separated out into
intel_fronbuffer.h for better kerneldoc and readability)
