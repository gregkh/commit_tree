greybus: arche-apb-ctrl: Assert reset to APB at the end of probe

Until we have proper handshake mechanism implemented with SVC
assert reset to APB at the end of probe.
We are safe here to do that, as SVC always enables clock to APB's
currently.
And also from EVT1 perspective, we should be good, as clock control
signals are now moved to AP.
