arm64: errata: Pass --fix-cortex-a53-843419 to ld if workaround enabled

Cortex-A53 erratum 843419 is worked around by the linker, although it is
a configure-time option to GCC as to whether ld is actually asked to
apply the workaround or not.

This patch ensures that we pass --fix-cortex-a53-843419 to the linker
when both CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_843419=y and the linker supports the
option.
