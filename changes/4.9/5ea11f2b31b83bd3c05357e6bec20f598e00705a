svm: Introduces AVIC per-VM ID

Introduces per-VM AVIC ID and helper functions to manage the IDs.
Currently, the ID will be used to implement 32-bit AVIC IOMMU GA tag.

The ID is 24-bit one-based indexing value, and is managed via helper
functions to get the next ID, or to free an ID once a VM is destroyed.
There should be no ID conflict for any active VMs.
