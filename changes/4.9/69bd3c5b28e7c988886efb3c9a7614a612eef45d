PCI: pciehp: Don't re-read Slot Status when handling surprise event

Previously we read Slot Status when handling a surprise event.  But Slot
Status might have changed since we identified the event, and the event_type
already tells us whether to enable or disable the slot, so there's no need
to read it again.

Remove handle_surprise_event() and queue the power work directly.
