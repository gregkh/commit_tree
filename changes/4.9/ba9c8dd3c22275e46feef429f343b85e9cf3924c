acpi, nfit: add dimm device notification support

Per "ACPI 6.1 Section 9.20.3" NVDIMM devices, children of the ACPI0012
NVDIMM Root device, can receive health event notifications.

Given that these devices are precluded from registering a notification
handler via acpi_driver.acpi_device_ops (due to no _HID), we use
acpi_install_notify_handler() directly.  The registered handler,
acpi_nvdimm_notify(), triggers a poll(2) event on the nmemX/nfit/flags
sysfs attribute when a health event notification is received.
