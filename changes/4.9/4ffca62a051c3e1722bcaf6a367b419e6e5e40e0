greybus: audio: Update parameters for gbaudio_module_update API

Earlier, module path was enabled based on module's control switch e.g.
'SPK Amp switch'.  Thus widget's name was sufficient to parse and
identify the direction. Now individual modules' path will be enabled
based on AIF widget status. So, it is required to get complete widget
details, say w->type is used to identify direction (playback/capture)
and w->sname is used to identify module's DATA connection used for
communication via greybus.
