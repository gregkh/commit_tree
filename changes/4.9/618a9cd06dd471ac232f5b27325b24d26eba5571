arc: Add "model" properly in device tree description of all boards

As it was discussed quite some time ago (see
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/11/5/862) it's a good practice to add
"model" property in .dts. Moreover as per ePAPR "model" property is
required and should look like "manufacturer,model" so we do here.
