[media] mb86a20s: fix the locking logic

On this frontend, it takes a while to start output normal
TS data. That only happens on state S9. On S8, the TS output
is enabled, but it is not reliable enough.

However, the zigzag loop is too fast to let it sync.

As, on practical tests, the zigzag software loop doesn't
seem to be helping, but just slowing down the tuning, let's
switch to hardware algorithm, as the tuners used on such
devices are capable of work with frequency drifts without
any help from software.
