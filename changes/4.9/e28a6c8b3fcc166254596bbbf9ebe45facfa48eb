[media] pulse8-cec: sync configuration with adapter

When the configuration is changed, they are also written to the adapter.
This allows the adapter to continue operating in autonomous mode with
the same settings when it is disconnected from the driver (typically by
going into suspend). For adapters with firmware version 2 or greater, the
settings are also persisted in EEPROM.

A new module parameter is added to optionally also use the configuration
already present in the adapter when it is connected. This option is
enabled by default.

When a new configuration is written, the autonomous mode is
automatically enabled. When the device is unconfigured, autonomous mode
is disabled.
