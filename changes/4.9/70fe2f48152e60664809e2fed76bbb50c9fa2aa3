aio: fix freeze protection of aio writes

Currently we dropped freeze protection of aio writes just after IO was
submitted. Thus aio write could be in flight while the filesystem was
frozen and that could result in unexpected situation like aio completion
wanting to convert extent type on frozen filesystem. Testcase from
Dmitry triggering this is like:

for ((i=0;i<60;i++));do fsfreeze -f /mnt ;sleep 1;fsfreeze -u /mnt;done &
fio --bs=4k --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=128 --size=1g --direct=1 \
    --runtime=60 --filename=/mnt/file --name=rand-write --rw=randwrite

Fix the problem by dropping freeze protection only once IO is completed
in aio_complete().
