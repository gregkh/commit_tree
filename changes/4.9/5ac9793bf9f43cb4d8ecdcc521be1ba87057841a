drm/i915: Fix use of engine->index for register offset

Since commit de1add360522 ("drm/i915: Decouple execbuf uAPI from internal
implementation") the index of the engine (its engine->id) in the
internal list no longer matches the hardware id. However, in a couple of
locations we missed fixing up the difference. In this case,
RING_FAULT_REG() refers to engine->id which is now not what the register
offset actually should be. Fortunately, in both case we should be more
or less looping over 0..I915_NUM_ENGINES.
