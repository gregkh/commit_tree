staging: lustre: llite: Fix the deadlock in balance_dirty_pages()

If the page is already dirtied in ll_write_end() and kernel tries
to call balance_dirty_pages() to write back dirty pages in the same
thread, this is deadlock case if the page is already held by clio.

This can also fix the issue of LU-4873.
