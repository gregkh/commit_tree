staging: lustre: ldlm: flock completion fixes.

Move checks for FAILED, DESTROYED flags under ldlm spinlock,
destroy flock atomically with the check it is not destroyed yet.
Do not put the granted flock into the resource if this is
UNLOCK, TEST, or DEADLOCK'ed flock.

Later a regression for this patch was reported under LU-7626.
The refcount nonzero (1) after lock cleanup errors was reported.
The reason is that the case LCK_NL was not handled for obdecho.
Patch 17791 resolved this issue which has been combined into
this upstream patch.
