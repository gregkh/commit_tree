spi: add driver for J-Core SPI controller

The J-Core "spi2" device is a PIO-based SPI master controller. It
differs from "bitbang" devices in that that it's clocked in hardware
rather than via soft clock modulation over gpio, and performs
byte-at-a-time transfers between the cpu and SPI controller.

This driver will be extended to support future versions of the J-Core
SPI controller with DMA transfers when they become available.
