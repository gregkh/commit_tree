io-mapping: Always create a struct to hold metadata about the io-mapping

Currently, we only allocate a structure to hold metadata if we need to
allocate an ioremap for every access, such as on x86-32. However, it
would be useful to store basic information about the io-mapping, such as
its page protection, on all platforms.
