xfs: pass bmapi flags through to bmap_del_extent

Pass BMAPI_ flags from bunmapi into bmap_del_extent and extend
BMAPI_REMAP (which means "don't touch the allocator or the quota
accounting") to apply to bunmapi as well.  This will be used to
implement the unmap operation, which will be used by swapext.
