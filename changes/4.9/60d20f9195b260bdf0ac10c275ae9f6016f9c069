bpf: Add bpf_current_task_under_cgroup helper

This adds a bpf helper that's similar to the skb_in_cgroup helper to check
whether the probe is currently executing in the context of a specific
subset of the cgroupsv2 hierarchy. It does this based on membership test
for a cgroup arraymap. It is invalid to call this in an interrupt, and
it'll return an error. The helper is primarily to be used in debugging
activities for containers, where you may have multiple programs running in
a given top-level "container".
