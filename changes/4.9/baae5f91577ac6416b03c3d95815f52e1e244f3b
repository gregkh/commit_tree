platform/x86: toshiba_haps: Change logging level from info to debug

Two of the internal functions are printing an info message, one
whenever the HDD protection level changes, and another when the
driver receives an ACPI event.

This patch changes those two prints to debug, as that information
is more pertaining to debuging purposes.
