usb: chipidea: host: fix NULL ptr dereference during shutdown

After commit b09b5224fe86 ("usb: chipidea: implement platform shutdown
callback") and commit 43a404577a93 ("usb: chipidea: host: set host to
be null after hcd is freed") a NULL pointer dereference is caused
on i.MX23 during shutdown. So ensure that role is set to CI_ROLE_END and
we finish interrupt handling before the hcd is deallocated. This avoids
the NULL pointer dereference.
