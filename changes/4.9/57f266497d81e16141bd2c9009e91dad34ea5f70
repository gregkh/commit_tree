powerpc: Use gas sections for arranging exception vectors

Use assembler sections of fixed size and location to arrange the 64-bit
Book3S exception vector code (64-bit Book3E also uses it in head_64.S
for 0x0..0x100).

This allows better flexibility in arranging exception code and hiding
unimportant details behind macros.

Gas sections can be a bit painful to use this way, mainly because the
assembler does not know where they will be finally linked. Taking
absolute addresses requires a bit of trickery for example, but it can
be hidden behind macros for the most part.

Generated code is mostly the same except locations, offsets, alignments.

The "+ 0x2" is only required for the trap number / kvm exit number,
which gets loaded as a constant into a register.

Previously, code also used + 0x2 for label names, but we changed to
using "H" to distinguish HV case for that. Remove the last vestiges
of that.

__after_prom_start is taking absolute address of a label in another
fixed section. Newer toolchains seemed to compile this okay, but older
ones do not. FIXED_SYMBOL_ABS_ADDR is more foolproof, it just takes an
additional line to define.
