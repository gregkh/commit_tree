x86/smpboot: Check APIC ID before setting up default routing

This is not a bugfix, but code optimization.

If the BSP's APIC ID in local APIC is unexpected,
a kernel panic will occur and the system will halt.
That means no need to enable APIC mode, and no reason
to set up the default routing for APIC.

The combination of default_setup_apic_routing() and
apic_bsp_setup() are used to enable APIC mode.
They two should be kept together, rather than being
separated by the codes of checking APIC ID.
Just like their usage in APIC_init_uniprocessor().
