net/mlx5: Add MLX5_ARRAY_SET64 to fix BUILD_BUG_ON

I am hitting this in mlx5:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/pagealloc.c: In function
reclaim_pages_cmd.clone.0:
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/pagealloc.c:346: error: call
to __compiletime_assert_346 declared with attribute error:
BUILD_BUG_ON failed: __mlx5_bit_off(manage_pages_out, pas[i]) % 64
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/pagealloc.c: In function give_pages:
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/pagealloc.c:291: error: call
to __compiletime_assert_291 declared with attribute error:
BUILD_BUG_ON failed: __mlx5_bit_off(manage_pages_in, pas[i]) % 64

Problem is that this is doing a BUILD_BUG_ON on a non-constant
expression because of trying to take offset of pas[i] in the
structure.

Fix is to create MLX5_ARRAY_SET64 that takes an additional argument
that is the field index to separate between BUILD_BUG_ON on the array
constant field and the indexed field to assign the value to.
There are two callers of MLX5_SET64 that are trying to get a variable
offset, change those to call MLX5_ARRAY_SET64 passing 'pas' and 'i'
as the arguments to use in the offset check and the indexed value
assignment.
