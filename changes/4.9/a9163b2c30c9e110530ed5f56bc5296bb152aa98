greybus: cancel buffers via magic cookie

Change the interface for canceling in-flight buffers to take a magic
cookie value as argument rather than a gbuf.  Right now we pass the
gbuf->hcd_data pointer that's assumed to have been set by the submit
routine.  But the next patch will change the submit routine to
return the cookie to be used, and the caller will be responsible for
keeping track of it.
