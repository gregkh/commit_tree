powerpc/fadump: Set core e_flags using kernel's ELF ABI version

Firmware Assisted Dump is a facility to dump kernel core with assistance
from firmware. As part of this process the kernel ELF ABI version is
stored in the core file.

Currently fadump.h defines this to 0 if it is not already defined. This
clashes with a define in elf.h which sets it based on the current task -
not based on the kernel's ELF ABI version.

Use the compiler-provided #define _CALL_ELF which tells us the ELF ABI
version of the kernel to set e_flags, this matches what binutils does.

Remove the definition in fadump.h, which becomes unused.
