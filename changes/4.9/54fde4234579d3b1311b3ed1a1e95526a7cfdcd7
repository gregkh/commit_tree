rxrpc: Fix checker warning by not passing always-zero value to ERR_PTR()

Fix the following checker warning:

	net/rxrpc/call_object.c:279 rxrpc_new_client_call()
	warn: passing zero to 'ERR_PTR'

where a value that's always zero is passed to ERR_PTR() so that it can be
passed to a tracepoint in an auxiliary pointer field.

Just pass NULL instead to the tracepoint.
