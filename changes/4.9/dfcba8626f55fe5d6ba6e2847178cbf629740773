greybus: operation: fix broken response error messages

The operation type included in the error message printed for malformed
responses has never been correct. An uninitialised buffer was used to
retrieve the type, resulting in the type always being reported as 0.

Fix this by passing a properly aligned header to the response handler,
and drop the now redundant id and result parameters.
