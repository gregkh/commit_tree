i40e: Increase minimum number of allocated VSI

This patch increases minimum number of allocated VSIs, so as to resolve
failure adding VSI for VF when 64-VFs assigned to a PF. The driver
supports up to 128 VFs per device, users can decide to enable up to
64-VFs on a single PF, especially 2 X 40 devices. In that scenario, with
VMDq co-existence, there would be starvation of VSIs - with this patch,
supported features would have enough VSIs for configuration now.
