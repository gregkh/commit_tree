pwm: meson: Handle unknown ID values

When building with -Wmaybe-uninitialized, we get a couple of harmless
warnings about three functions in this new driver that don't look
safe to the compiler:

drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c: In function 'meson_pwm_get_state':
drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c:355:26: error: 'mask' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c: In function 'meson_pwm_disable':
drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c:263:13: error: 'enable' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c: In function 'meson_pwm_apply':
drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c:231:13: error: 'clk_shift' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c:231:36: error: 'enable' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.c:231:24: error: 'clk_enable' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Specifically, if we have a device with an ID other than 0 or 1,
this would result in undefined behavior. This is currently not
possible, but the compiler cannot be expected to know this.

This patch adds a 'default' clause to let the compiler know
what to do instead, which shuts up the warning and makes the
code slightly more resiliant in case it gets extended to other
identifiers.
