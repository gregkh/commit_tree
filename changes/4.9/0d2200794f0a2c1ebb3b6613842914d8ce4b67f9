drm/mediatek: modify the factor to make the pll_rate set in the 1G-2G range

Currently, the code sets the "pll" to the desired multiple
of the pixel clock manully(4*3m 8*3,etc).  The valid range
of the pll is 1G-2G, however, when the pixel clock is bigger
than 167MHz,  the "pll" will be set to a invalid value( > 2G),
then the "pll" will be 2GHz, thus the pixel clock will be in
correct. Change the factor to make the "pll" be set in the
(1G, 2G) range.
