rxrpc: Make /proc/net/rxrpc_calls safer

Make /proc/net/rxrpc_calls safer by stashing a copy of the peer pointer in
the rxrpc_call struct and checking in the show routine that the peer
pointer, the socket pointer and the local pointer obtained from the socket
pointer aren't NULL before we use them.
