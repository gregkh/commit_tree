do_generic_file_read(): fail immediately if killed

If a fatal signal has been received, fail immediately instead of trying
to read more data.

If wait_on_page_locked_killable() was interrupted then this page is most
likely is not PageUptodate() and in this case do_generic_file_read()
will fail after lock_page_killable().

lock_page when waiting for IO to complete during a read")
