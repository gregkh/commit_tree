watchdog: pretimeout: add panic pretimeout governor

The change adds panic watchdog pretimeout governor, on watchdog
pretimeout event the kernel shall panic. In general watchdog
pretimeout event means that something essentially bad is going on the
system, for example a process scheduler stalls or watchdog feeder is
killed due to OOM, so printing out information attendant to panic and
before likely unavoidable reboot caused by a watchdog may help to
determine a root cause of the issue.
