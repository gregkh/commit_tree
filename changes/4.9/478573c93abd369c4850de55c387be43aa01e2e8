driver core: Don't leak secondary fwnode on device removal

If device_add_property_set() is called for a device, a secondary fwnode
is allocated and assigned to the device but currently not freed once the
device is removed.

This can be triggered on Apple Macs if a Thunderbolt device is plugged
in on boot since Apple's NHI EFI driver sets a number of properties for
that device which are leaked on unplug.
