ACPICA: Tables: Override all 64-bit GAS fields when acpi_gbl_use32_bit_fadt_addresses is TRUE

ACPICA commit aaace77db4c3b267a65b75c33f84ace6f65bbcf7

Originally, when acpi_gbl_use32_bit_fadt_addresses is TRUE, GAS override can
only happen when the Address field mismatches.

According to the investigation result, Windows may favor 32-bit FADT
addresses in some cases. So we need this quirk working after enabling full
GAS support. This requires us to override GAS access_size/bit_width/bit_offset
fields as long as acpi_gbl_use32_bit_fadt_addresses is TRUE.
This patch enhances this quirk mechanism to make it working with full GAS
support. Lv Zheng.
