mm, compaction: more reliably increase direct compaction priority

During reclaim/compaction loop, compaction priority can be increased by
the should_compact_retry() function, but the current code is not
optimal.  Priority is only increased when compaction_failed() is true,
which means that compaction has scanned the whole zone.  This may not
happen even after multiple attempts with a lower priority due to
parallel activity, so we might needlessly struggle on the lower
priorities and possibly run out of compaction retry attempts in the
process.

After this patch we are guaranteed at least one attempt at the highest
compaction priority even if we exhaust all retries at the lower
priorities.
