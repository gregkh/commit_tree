zram: fix unbalanced idr management at hot removal

The zram hot removal code calls idr_remove() even when zram_remove()
returns an error (typically -EBUSY).  This results in a leftover at the
device release, eventually leading to a crash when the module is
reloaded.

As described in the bug report below, the following procedure would
cause an Oops with zram:

 - provision three zram devices via modprobe zram num_devices=3
 - configure a size for each device
   + echo "1G" > /sys/block/$zram_name/disksize
 - mkfs and mount zram0 only
 - attempt to hot remove all three devices
   + echo 2 > /sys/class/zram-control/hot_remove
   + echo 1 > /sys/class/zram-control/hot_remove
   + echo 0 > /sys/class/zram-control/hot_remove
     - zram0 removal fails with EBUSY, as expected
 - unmount zram0
 - try zram0 hot remove again
   + echo 0 > /sys/class/zram-control/hot_remove
     - fails with ENODEV (unexpected)
 - unload zram kernel module
   + completes successfully
 - zram0 device node still exists
 - attempt to mount /dev/zram0
   + mount command is killed
   + following BUG is encountered

This patch adds the proper error check in hot_remove_store() not to call
idr_remove() unconditionally.
