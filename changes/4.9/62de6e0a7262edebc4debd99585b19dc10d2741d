greybus: es2: don't protest when getting -ENOENT/ESHUTDOWN USB errors

-ENOENT or -ESHUTDOWN happens when the urbs are being killed from
->disconnect() callback.  Don't complain to userspace about this, as the
user will see this on es2 module removal.

Tested by removing the gb-es2.ko module on both EVT1.5 and qemu with
gbsim. The driver doesn't throw anymore errors like:
"urb cport in error -2 (dropped)".
