staging: lustre: obdclass: serialize lu_site purge

Umount process relies on lu_site_purge(-1) to purge all
objects before umount, however, if there happen to have a
cache shrinker which calls lu_site_purge(nr) in parallel,
some objects may still being freed by cache shrinker even
after the lu_site_purge(-1) called by umount done.

This can be simply fixed by serializing purge threads,
since it doesn't make any sense to have them in parallel.
