greybus: loopback: Relax locking during loopback operations

Currently a per-connection mutex is held during calls to
gb_operation_send_sync. It is not necessary to hold this lock and later
patches supporting multiple-outstanding bi-directional operations need to
take the per-connection lock and the gb_dev level lock. Since gb_dev must
always be taken before per-connection locks, it is both desirable and safe
to drop the lock now.
