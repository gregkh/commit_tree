ASoC: tlv320dac33: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

The workqueue "dac33_wq" queues a single work item &dac33->work and
hence doesn't require ordering. Also, it is not being used on a memory
reclaim path. Hence, it has been converted to use system_wq.

System workqueues have been able to handle high level of concurrency
for a long time now and hence it's not required to have a singlethreaded
workqueue just to gain concurrency. Unlike a dedicated per-cpu workqueue
created with create_singlethread_workqueue(), system_wq allows multiple
work items to overlap executions even on the same CPU; however, a
per-cpu workqueue doesn't have any CPU locality or global ordering
guarantee unless the target CPU is explicitly specified and thus the
increase of local concurrency shouldn't make any difference.

The work item has been flushed in dac33_soc_remove to ensure that
there are no pending tasks while disconnecting the driver.
