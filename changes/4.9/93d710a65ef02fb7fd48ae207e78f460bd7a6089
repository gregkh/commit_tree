i2c: mux: fix up dependencies

We get the following build error from UM Linux after adding
an entry to drivers/iio/gyro/Kconfig that issues "select I2C_MUX":

ERROR: "devm_ioremap_resource"
   [drivers/i2c/muxes/i2c-mux-reg.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "of_address_to_resource"
   [drivers/i2c/muxes/i2c-mux-reg.ko] undefined!

It appears that the I2C mux core code depends on HAS_IOMEM
for historical reasons, while CONFIG_I2C_MUX_REG does *not*
have a direct dependency on HAS_IOMEM.

This creates a situation where a allyesconfig or allmodconfig
for UM Linux will select I2C_MUX, and will implicitly enable
I2C_MUX_REG as well, and the compilation will fail for the
register driver.

Fix this up by making I2C_MUX_REG depend on HAS_IOMEM and
removing the dependency from I2C_MUX.
