netfilter: nf_queue: improve queue range support for bridge family

After commit ac2863445686 ("netfilter: bridge: add nf_afinfo to enable
queuing to userspace"), we can queue packets to the user space in bridge
family. But when the user specify the queue range, packets will be only
delivered to the first queue num. Because in nfqueue_hash, we only support
ipv4 and ipv6 family. Now add support for bridge family too.
