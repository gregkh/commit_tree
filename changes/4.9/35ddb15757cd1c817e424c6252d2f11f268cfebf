ASoC: fsl_spdif: use flat regmap cache

Subject: drm/fsl-dcu: use flat regmap cache

Using flat regmap cache instead of RB-tree to avoid the following
lockdep warning on driver load:
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:2871 lockdep_trace_alloc+0x104/0x128
DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(irqs_disabled_flags(flags))

The RB-tree regmap cache needs to allocate new space on first
writes. However, allocations in an atomic context (e.g. when a
spinlock is held) are not allowed. The function regmap_write
calls map->lock, which acquires a spinlock in the fast_io case.
Since the driver uses MMIO, the regmap bus of type regmap_mmio
is being used which has fast_io set to true.
