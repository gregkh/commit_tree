dmaengine: mv_xor: Add support for IO (PCIe) src/dst areas

To enable the access to a specific area, the MVEBU XOR controllers needs
to have this area enabled / mapped via an address window. Right now,
only the DRAM memory area is enabled via such memory windows. So
using this driver to DMA to / from a e.g. PCIe memory region is
currently not supported.

This patch now adds support for such PCIe / IO regions by checking
if the src / dst address is located in an IO memory area in contrast
to being located in DRAM. This is done by using the newly introduced
MBus function mvebu_mbus_get_io_win_info(). If the src / dst address
is located in such an IO area, a new address window is created in
the XOR DMA controller. Enabling the controller to access this area.
