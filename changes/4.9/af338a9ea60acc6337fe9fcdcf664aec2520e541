rxrpc: The client call state must be changed before attachment to conn

We must set the client call state to RXRPC_CALL_CLIENT_SEND_REQUEST before
attaching the call to the connection struct, not after, as it's liable to
receive errors and conn aborts as soon as the assignment is made - and
these will cause its state to be changed outside of the initiating thread's
control.
