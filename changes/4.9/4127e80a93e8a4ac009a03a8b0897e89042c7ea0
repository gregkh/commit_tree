ALSA: seq: initialize whole fields of automatic variable with union type

Currently, automatic variable of 'union ioctl_arg' type is initialized
by designated initialization. Although, the actual effect is interpretation
of early element of int type and initialization of 'int pversion'.
Therefore the first field corresponding to int type is initialized to zero.
This is against my expectation to initialize whole fields.

This commit uses memset() to initialize the variable, instead of designated
initialization.
