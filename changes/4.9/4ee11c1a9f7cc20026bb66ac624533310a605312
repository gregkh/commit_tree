powerpc/powernv: Provide facilities for EOI, usable from real mode

This adds a new function pnv_opal_pci_msi_eoi() which does the part of
end-of-interrupt (EOI) handling of an MSI which involves doing an
OPAL call.  This function can be called in real mode.  This doesn't
just export pnv_ioda2_msi_eoi() because that does a call to
icp_native_eoi(), which does not work in real mode.

This also adds a function, is_pnv_opal_msi(), which KVM can call to
check whether an interrupt is one for which we should be calling
pnv_opal_pci_msi_eoi() when we need to do an EOI.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - split out the addition of pnv_opal_pci_msi_eoi()
 from Suresh's patch "KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Handle passthrough
 interrupts in guest"; added is_pnv_opal_msi(); wrote description.]
