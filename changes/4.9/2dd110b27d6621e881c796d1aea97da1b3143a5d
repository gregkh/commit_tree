mmc: sunxi-mmc: change idma descriptor to __le32

The sunxi-mmc driver does not take into account the processor may be big
endian when writing the DMA descriptors. This causes cards not to be
detected when running a big-endian kernel. Change the descriptors for
IDMA to use __le32 and ensure they are suitably swapped before writing.
Tested successfully on the Cubieboard2.
