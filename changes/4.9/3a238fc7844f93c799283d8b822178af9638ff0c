greybus: spi: add inprogress bit to xfer_flags

When a SPI transfer needs to be split by more than one greybus spi
transfer operation, we need to indicate it so the controller can handle
the chip select lines correctly.

Add a new bit to indicate it, GB_SPI_XFER_INPROGRESS, and create an
helper function to calculate when the transfer is done. As we need this
information also in other places.
