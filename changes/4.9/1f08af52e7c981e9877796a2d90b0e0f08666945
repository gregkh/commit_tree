xfs: implement swapext for rmap filesystems

Implement swapext for filesystems that have reverse mapping.  Back in
the reflink patches, we augmented the bmap code with a 'REMAP' flag
that updates only the bmbt and doesn't touch the allocator and
implemented log redo items for those two operations.  Now we can
rewrite extent swapping as a (looong) series of remap operations.

This is far less efficient than the fork swapping method implemented
in the past, so we only switch this on for rmap.
