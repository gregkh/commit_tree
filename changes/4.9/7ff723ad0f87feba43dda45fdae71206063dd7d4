scsi: mpt3sas: Unblock device after controller reset

While issuing any ATA passthrough command to firmware the driver will
block the device. But it will unblock the device only if the I/O
completes through the ISR path. If a controller reset occurs before
command completion the device will remain in blocked state.

Make sure we unblock the device following a controller reset if an ATA
passthrough command was queued.
