drm/i915/shrinker: Wait before acquiring struct_mutex under oom

We can now wait for the GPU (all engines) to become idle without
requiring the struct_mutex. Inside the shrinker, we need to currently
take the struct_mutex in order to purge objects and to purge the objects
we need the GPU to be idle - causing a stall whilst we hold the
struct_mutex. We can hide most of that stall by performing the wait
before taking the struct_mutex and only doing essential waits for
new rendering on objects to be freed.
