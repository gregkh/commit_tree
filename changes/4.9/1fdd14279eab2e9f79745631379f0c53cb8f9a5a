scsi: scsi_dh_alua: fix missing kref_put() in alua_rtpg_work()

Reference count of pg leaks in alua_rtpg_work() since kref_put() is not
called to decrease the reference count of pg when the condition
pg->rtpg_sdev==NULL satisfied (actually it is easy to satisfy), it would
cause memory of pg leakage.
