drm/bridge: introduce bridge detaching mechanism

Up to now, once a bridge has been attached to a DRM device, it cannot
be undone.

In particular you couldn't rmmod/insmod a DRM driver that uses a bridge,
because the bridge would remain bound to the first (dead) driver instance.

This patch fixes this by introducing drm_encoder_detach() and a ->detach
callback in drm_bridge_funcs for the bridge to be notified about detaches.

It's DRM/KMS driver responsibility to call drm_encoder_detach().

While adding the bridge detach callback, with its kerneldoc, I also added
kerneldoc for attach callback.

Few other kerneldocs fixes around there are included.
