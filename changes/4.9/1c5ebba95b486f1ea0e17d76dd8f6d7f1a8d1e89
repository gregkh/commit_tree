iommu/vt-d: Make sure RMRRs are mapped before domain goes public

When a domain is allocated through the get_valid_domain_for_dev
path, it will be context-mapped before the RMRR regions are
mapped in the page-table. This opens a short time window
where device-accesses to these regions fail and causing DMAR
faults.

Fix this by mapping the RMRR regions before the domain is
context-mapped.
