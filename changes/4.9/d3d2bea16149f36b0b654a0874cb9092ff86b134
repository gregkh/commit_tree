greybus: clean up some small messes

This is an old patch that I neglected to send out.  It's cleaning
up a couple things that got committed before I had a chance to
comment on them.

In operation.c there is a "FIXME" comment that is easily proven
wrong by inspection.

In gb_protocol_put(), there is another wrong "FIXME" comment as
well.  We can also use our cached copies of the protocol major
and minor version number in another spot.  And balance that
out by using a cached copy of the protocol id.
