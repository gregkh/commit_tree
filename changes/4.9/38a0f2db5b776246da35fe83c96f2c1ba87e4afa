drm/i915: rename 'ring' where it refers to an engine or engine_id

'ring' is an old deprecated term for a GPU engine. Chris Wilson wants to
use the name for what is currently known as an intel_ringbuffer, but it
will be dreadfully confusing if some rings are ringbuffers but other
rings are still engines. So this patch changes the names of a bunch of
parameters called 'ring' to either 'engine' or 'engine_id' according to
what they actually are.
