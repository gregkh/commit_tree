perf hists: Introduce hists__link_hierarchy()

The hists__link_hierarchy() is to support hierarchy reports with an
event group.  When it matches the leader event and the other members
(using hists__match_hierarchy()), it also needs to link unmatched member
entries with a dummy leader event so that it can show up in the output.
