scsi: be2iscsi: Fix checks for HBA in error state

Save ue_detected and fw_timeout errors in state field of beiscsi_hba.
BEISCSI_HBA_RUNNING
BEISCSI_HBA_LINK_UP
BEISCSI_HBA_BOOT_FOUND
BEISCSI_HBA_PCI_ERR
BEISCSI_HBA_FW_TIMEOUT
BEISCSI_HBA_IN_UE

Make sure no PCI transaction happens once in error state.
Add checks in IO path to detect HBA in error.

Skip hwi_purge_eq step which can't be done in error state.
