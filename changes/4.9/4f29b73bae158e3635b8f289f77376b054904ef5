x86/mce/AMD: Extract the error address on SMCA systems

The MCA_ADDR registers on Scalable MCA systems contain the ErrorAddr
in bits [55:0] and the least significant bit of the address in bits
[61:56]. We should extract the valid ErrorAddr bits from the MCA_ADDR
register rather than saving the raw value to struct mce.
