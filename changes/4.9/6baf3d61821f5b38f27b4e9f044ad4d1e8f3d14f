x86/tsc: Add additional Intel CPU models to the crystal quirk list

commit aa297292d708 ("x86/tsc: Enumerate SKL cpu_khz and tsc_khz via
CPUID") added code to retrieve the crystal and TSC frequency from CPUID
leaves. If the crystal freqency is enumerated as 0,the resulting TSC
frequency is 0 as well. For CPUs with a known fixed crystal frequency a
quirk list is available to set the frequency,

Kabylake and SkylakeX CPUs are missing in the list of CPUs which need this
quirk. Add them so the TSC frequency can be calculated correctly.

[ tglx: Removed the silly default case as the switch() is only invoked when
  	cpu_khz is 0. Massaged changelog. ]
