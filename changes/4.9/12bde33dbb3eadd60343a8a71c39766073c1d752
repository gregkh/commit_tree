cpufreq / sched: Pass runqueue pointer to cpufreq_update_util()

All of the callers of cpufreq_update_util() pass rq_clock(rq) to it
as the time argument and some of them check whether or not cpu_of(rq)
is equal to smp_processor_id() before calling it, so rework it to
take a runqueue pointer as the argument and move the rq_clock(rq)
evaluation into it.

Additionally, provide a wrapper checking cpu_of(rq) against
smp_processor_id() for the cpufreq_update_util() callers that
need it.
