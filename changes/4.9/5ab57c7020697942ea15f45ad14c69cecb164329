drm/i915: Flush logical context image out to memory upon suspend

Before suspend, and especially before building the hibernation image, we
need to context image to be coherent in memory. To do this we require
that we perform a context switch to a disposable context (i.e. the
dev_priv->kernel_context) - when that switch is complete, all other
context images will be complete. This leaves the kernel_context image as
incomplete, but fortunately that is disposable and we can do a quick
fixup of the logical state after resuming.

v2: Share the nearly identical code to switch to the kernel context with
eviction.
v3: Explain why we need the switch and reset.
