serial: earlycon: Extend earlycon command line option to support 64-bit addresses

earlycon implementation used "unsigned long" internally, but there are systems
(ARM with LPAE) where sizeof(unsigned long) == 4 and uart is mapped beyond 4GiB
address range.

Switch to resource_size_t internally and replace obsoleted simple_strtoul() with
kstrtoull().
