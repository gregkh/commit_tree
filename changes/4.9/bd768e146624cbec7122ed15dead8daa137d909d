KVM: x86: fix wbinvd_dirty_mask use-after-free

vcpu->arch.wbinvd_dirty_mask may still be used after freeing it,
corrupting memory. For example, the following call trace may set a bit
in an already freed cpu mask:
    kvm_arch_vcpu_load
    vcpu_load
    vmx_free_vcpu_nested
    vmx_free_vcpu
    kvm_arch_vcpu_free

Fix this by deferring freeing of wbinvd_dirty_mask.
