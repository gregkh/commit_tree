rc: print correct variable for z8f0811

A recent rework accidentally left a debugging printk untouched while
changing the meaning of the variables, leading to an uninitialized
variable being printed:

  drivers/media/i2c/ir-kbd-i2c.c: In function 'get_key_haup_common':
  drivers/media/i2c/ir-kbd-i2c.c:62:2: error: 'toggle' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This prints the correct one instead, as we did before the patch.
