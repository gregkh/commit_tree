NFSv4: Pass the stateid to the exception handler in nfs4_read/write_done_cb

The actual stateid used in the READ or WRITE can represent a delegation,
a lock or a stateid, so it is useful to pass it as an argument to the
exception handler when an expired/revoked response is received from the
server. It also ensures that we don't re-label the state as needing
recovery if that has already occurred.
