genirq: Expose interrupt information through sysfs

Information about interrupts is exposed via /proc/interrupts, but the
format of that file has changed over kernel versions and differs across
architectures. It also has varying column numbers depending on hardware.

That all makes it hard for tools to parse.

To solve this, expose the information through sysfs so each irq attribute
is in a separate file in a consistent, machine parsable way.

This feature is only available when both CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ and
CONFIG_SYSFS are enabled.

Examples:
  /sys/kernel/irq/18/actions:	i801_smbus,ehci_hcd:usb1,uhci_hcd:usb7
  /sys/kernel/irq/18/chip_name:	IR-IO-APIC
  /sys/kernel/irq/18/hwirq:		18
  /sys/kernel/irq/18/name:		fasteoi
  /sys/kernel/irq/18/per_cpu_count:	0,0
  /sys/kernel/irq/18/type:		level

  /sys/kernel/irq/25/actions:	ahci0
  /sys/kernel/irq/25/chip_name:	IR-PCI-MSI
  /sys/kernel/irq/25/hwirq:		512000
  /sys/kernel/irq/25/name:		edge
  /sys/kernel/irq/25/per_cpu_count:	29036,0
  /sys/kernel/irq/25/type:		edge
