net: thunderx: Moved HW capability info from macros to structure

Current driver has most of the HW maximums info like no of channels,
traffic limiters, RSS indices e.t.c in the form of macros. These have
been moved into a 'hw_info' structure so that support for VNIC on
newer chips with different set of HW maximums can be added.
