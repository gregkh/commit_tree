xfs: allocate delayed extents in CoW fork

Modify the writepage handler to find and convert pending delalloc
extents to real allocations.  Furthermore, when we're doing non-cow
writes to a part of a file that already has a CoW reservation (the
cowextsz hint that we set up in a subsequent patch facilitates this),
promote the write to copy-on-write so that the entire extent can get
written out as a single extent on disk, thereby reducing post-CoW
fragmentation.

Christoph moved the CoW support code in _map_blocks to a separate helper
function, refactored other functions, and reduced the number of CoW fork
lookups, so I merged those changes here to reduce churn.
