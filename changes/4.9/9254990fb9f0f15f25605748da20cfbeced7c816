oom: warn if we go OOM for higher order and compaction is disabled

Since the lumpy reclaim is gone there is no source of higher order pages
if CONFIG_COMPACTION=n except for the order-0 pages reclaim which is
unreliable for that purpose to say the least.  Hitting an OOM for
!costly higher order requests is therefore all not that hard to imagine.
We are trying hard to not invoke OOM killer as much as possible but
there is simply no reliable way to detect whether more reclaim retries
make sense.

Disabling COMPACTION is not widespread but it seems that some users
might have disable the feature without realizing full consequences
(mostly along with disabling THP because compaction used to be THP
mainly thing).  This patch just adds a note if the OOM killer was
triggered by higher order request with compaction disabled.  This will
help us identifying possible misconfiguration right from the oom report
which is easier than to always keep in mind that somebody might have
disabled COMPACTION without a good reason.
