scsi: cxlflash: Improve EEH recovery time

When an EEH occurs during device initialization, the port timeout logic
can cause excessive delays as MMIO reads will fail. Depending on where
they are experienced, these delays can lead to a prolonged reset,
causing an unnecessary triggering of other timeout logic in the SCSI
stack or user applications.

To expedite recovery, the port timeout logic is updated to decay the
timeout at a much faster rate when in the presence of a likely EEH
frozen event.
