greybus: drop host-driver buffer headroom

Drop the host-driver buffer headroom that was used to transfer the cport
id on ES1 and ES2.

Rather than transferring additional bytes on the wire and having to deal
with buffer-alignment issues (e.g. requiring the headroom to be a
multiple of 8 bytes) simply drop the headroom functionality.

Host drivers are expected set up their transfer descriptors separately
from the data buffers and any intermediate drivers (e.g. for Greybus
over USB) can (ab)use the operation message pad bytes for now.
