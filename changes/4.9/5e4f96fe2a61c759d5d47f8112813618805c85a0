x86/platform/uv/BAU: Add generic function pointers

Many BAU functions have different implementations depending on the UV
version. Rather than switching on the uvhub_version throughout the driver,
we can define a set of operations for each version. This is especially
beneficial for UV4, which will require many new MMR read/write functions.

Currently, the set of abstracted functions are the same for UV1, UV2, and
UV3. The functions were chosen because each one will have a different
implementation for UV4. Other functions will be added as needed to handle
new implementations or to cleanup the existing differences between UV1,
UV2, and UV3, i.e. read_status and wait_completion.
