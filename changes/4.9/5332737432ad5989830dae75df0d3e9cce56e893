drm/exynos: g2d: remove runqueue nodes in g2d_{close,remove}()

The driver might be closed (and/or removed) while there are still
nodes queued for processing.
Make sure to remove these nodes, which means all of them in
the case of g2d_remove() and only those belonging to the
corresponding process in g2d_close().
