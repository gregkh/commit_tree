powerpc: Only disable HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS on POWER7 little endian

POWER8 handles unaligned accesses in little endian mode, but commit
0b5e6661ac69 ("powerpc: Don't set HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS on
little endian builds") disabled it for all.

The issue with unaligned little endian accesses is specific to POWER7,
so update the Kconfig check to match. Using the stat() testcase from
commit a75c380c7129 ("powerpc: Enable DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS on ppc64le"),
performance improves 15% on POWER8.
