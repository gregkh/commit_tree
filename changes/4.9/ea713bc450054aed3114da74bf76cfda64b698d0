gpio: OF: separation of concerns

The generic GPIO library directly implement code for of_find_gpio()
which is only used with CONFIG_OF and causes compilation problems
on archs that do not even have stubs for OF functions, especially
on UM that does not implement any IO remap functions.

Move the function to gpiolib-of.c, implement a static inline stub
in gpiolib.h returning PTR_ERR(-ENOENT) if CONFIG_OF_GPIO is not
set and be done with it.
