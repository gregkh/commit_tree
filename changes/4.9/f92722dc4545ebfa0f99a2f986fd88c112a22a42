MIPS: Correct MIPS I FP sigcontext layout

Complement commit 80cbfad79096 ("MIPS: Correct MIPS I FP context
layout") and correct the way Floating Point General registers are stored
in a signal context with MIPS I hardware.

Use the S.D and L.D assembly macros to have pairs of SWC1 instructions
and pairs of LWC1 instructions produced, respectively, in an arrangement
which makes the memory representation of floating-point data passed
compatible with that used by hardware SDC1 and LDC1 instructions, where
available, regardless of the hardware endianness used.  This matches the
layout used by r4k_fpu.S, ensuring run-time compatibility for MIPS I
software across all o32 hardware platforms.

Define an EX2 macro to handle exceptions from both hardware instructions
implicitly produced from S.D and L.D assembly macros.
