bridge: multicast: restore perm router ports on multicast enable

Satish reported a problem with the perm multicast router ports not getting
reenabled after some series of events, in particular if it happens that the
multicast snooping has been disabled and the port goes to disabled state
then it will be deleted from the router port list, but if it moves into
non-disabled state it will not be re-added because the mcast snooping is
still disabled, and enabling snooping later does nothing.

Here are the steps to reproduce, setup br0 with snooping enabled and eth1
added as a perm router (multicast_router = 2):
1. $ echo 0 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/multicast_snooping
2. $ ip l set eth1 down
^ This step deletes the interface from the router list
3. $ ip l set eth1 up
^ This step does not add it again because mcast snooping is disabled
4. $ echo 1 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/multicast_snooping
5. $ bridge -d -s mdb show
<empty>

At this point we have mcast enabled and eth1 as a perm router (value = 2)
but it is not in the router list which is incorrect.

After this change:
1. $ echo 0 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/multicast_snooping
2. $ ip l set eth1 down
^ This step deletes the interface from the router list
3. $ ip l set eth1 up
^ This step does not add it again because mcast snooping is disabled
4. $ echo 1 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/multicast_snooping
5. $ bridge -d -s mdb show
router ports on br0: eth1

Note: we can directly do br_multicast_enable_port for all because the
querier timer already has checks for the port state and will simply
expire if it's in blocking/disabled. See the comment added by
commit 9aa66382163e7 ("bridge: multicast: add a comment to
br_port_state_selection about blocking state")
