net: qcom/emac: do not use devm on internal phy pdev

The platform_device returned by of_find_device_by_node() is not
automatically released when the driver unprobes.  Therefore,
managed calls like devm_ioremap_resource() should not be used.
Instead, we manually allocate the resources and then free them
on driver release.
