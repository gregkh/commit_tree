Revert "sched/core: Do not use smp_processor_id() with preempt enabled in smpboot_thread_fn()"

This reverts commit 4fa5cd5245b627db88c9ca08ae442373b02596b4.

The original change widens a preempt-off section, to avoid a seemingly unsafe
smp_processor_id() use.

During review I overlooked two facts:

 - The code to calls a non-trivial function callback:

                                ht->park(td->cpu);

   ... which might (and does occasionally) sleep, triggering the warning.

 - More importantly, as pointed out by Peter Zijlstra, using
   smp_processor_id() in that context is safe, if it's done from
   a kernel thread that is pinned to a single CPU - which is the
   case here.

So revert to the original code that enables preemption sooner.
