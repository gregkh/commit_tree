[media] media: rc: nuvoton: remove unneeded call to ir_raw_event_handle

ir_raw_event_handle is called anyway after the hw fifo content stored
in nvt->buf[] has been written to the kfifo. There is not really a
benefit in the potential additional call to ir_raw_event_handle
whilst nvt->buf[] is being processed.
Getting rid of this additional call allows to simplify the code.
