staging: unisys: visorbus: fix visorchannel.c comments

This patch ONLY touches comment lines, i.e., NO executable code is
affected.

Comments were fixed in visorchannel.c:
* All functions worthy of documenting now use standard kerneldoc
  formatting.
* Multi-line comments were tweaked so as to use appropriate conventions.
* Minor typos were corrected.
* Useless comments were removed.
