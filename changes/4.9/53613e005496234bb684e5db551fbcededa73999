perf jit: Fix build issue on Ubuntu

When building on Ubuntu 16.04, I get the following error:

Makefile:49: *** the openjdk development package appears to me missing, install and try again.  Stop.

The problem is that update-java-alternatives has multiple spaces between
fields, and cut treats each space as a new delimiter:

java-1.8.0-openjdk-ppc64el     1081       /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-ppc64el

Fix this by using awk, which handles this fine.
