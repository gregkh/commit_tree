i40e: check conflicting ntuple/sideband rules when re-enabling ATR

In i40e_fdir_check_and_reenable(), the driver performs some checks to
determine whether it is safe to re-enable FD Sideband and FD ATR
support. The current check will only determine if there is available
space in the flow director table. However, this ignores the fact that
ATR should be disabled when there are TCP/IPv4 sideband rules in effect.
Add the missing check, and update the info message printed when
I40E_DEBUG_FD is enabled.
