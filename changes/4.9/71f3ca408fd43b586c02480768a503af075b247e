rxrpc: Improve skb tracing

Improve sk_buff tracing within AF_RXRPC by the following means:

 (1) Use an enum to note the event type rather than plain integers and use
     an array of event names rather than a big multi ?: list.

 (2) Distinguish Rx from Tx packets and account them separately.  This
     requires the call phase to be tracked so that we know what we might
     find in rxtx_buffer[].

 (3) Add a parameter to rxrpc_{new,see,get,free}_skb() to indicate the
     event type.

 (4) A pair of 'rotate' events are added to indicate packets that are about
     to be rotated out of the Rx and Tx windows.

 (5) A pair of 'lost' events are added, along with rxrpc_lose_skb() for
     packet loss injection recording.
