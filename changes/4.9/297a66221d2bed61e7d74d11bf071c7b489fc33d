cpufreq: dt: Support governor tunables per policy

The cpufreq-dt driver is also used for systems with multiple
clock/voltage domains for CPUs, i.e. multiple cpufreq policies in a
system.

And in such cases the platform users may want to enable "governor
tunables per policy". Support that via platform data, as not all users
of the driver would want that behavior.
