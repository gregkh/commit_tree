drm: Update connector documentation

- Shuffle docs from drm-kms.rst into the structure docs where it makes
  sense.
- Put the remaining bits into a new overview section.

One thing I've changed is around probing: Old docs says that you
_must_ use the probe helpers, which isn't correct. Helpers are always
optional.
