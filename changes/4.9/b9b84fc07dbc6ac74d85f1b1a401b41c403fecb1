net: mv643xx_eth: ensure coalesce settings survive read-modify-write

The coalesce settings behave badly when changing just one value:

... # ethtool -c eth0
rx-usecs: 249
... # ethtool -C eth0 tx-usecs 250
... # ethtool -c eth0
rx-usecs: 248

This occurs due to rounding errors when calculating the microseconds
value - the divisons round down.  This causes (eg) the rx-usecs to
decrease by one every time the tx-usecs value is set as per the above.

Fix this by making the divison round-to-nearest.
