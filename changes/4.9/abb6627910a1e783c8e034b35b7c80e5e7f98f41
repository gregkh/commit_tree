cpufreq: conservative: Fix next frequency selection

Commit d352cf47d93e (cpufreq: conservative: Do not use transition
notifications) overlooked the case when the "frequency step" used
by the conservative governor is small relative to the distances
between the available frequencies and broke the algorithm by
using policy->cur instead of the previously requested frequency
when computing the next one.

As a result, the governor may not be able to go outside of a narrow
range between two consecutive available frequencies.

Fix the problem by making the governor save the previously requested
frequency and select the next one relative that value (unless it is
out of range, in which case policy->cur will be used instead).
