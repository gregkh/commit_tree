arm64: KVM: vgic-v2: Add GICV access from HYP

Now that we have the necessary infrastructure to handle MMIO accesses
in HYP, perform the GICV access on behalf of the guest. This requires
checking that the access is strictly 32bit, properly aligned, and
falls within the expected range.

When all condition are satisfied, we perform the access and tell
the rest of the HYP code that the instruction has been correctly
emulated.
