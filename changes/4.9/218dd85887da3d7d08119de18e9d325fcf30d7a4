.gitattributes: set git diff driver for C source code files

Git can be told to apply language-specific rules when generating diffs.
Enable this for C source code files (*.c and *.h) so that function names
are printed right.  Specifically, doing so prevents "git diff" from
mistakenly considering unindented goto labels as function names.
