HID: intel-ish-hid: request_irq failure

On some platforms ISH interrupt is shared, which causes request_irq to
fail. This requires IRQF_SHARED irq flag.

But IRQF_NO_SUSPEND and IRQF_SHARED should not be used together, so
removed IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag. Anyway this driver doesn't require
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, as this interrupt is not required during "noirq" phases
of suspending and resuming devices as well as during the time when
nonboot CPUs are taken offline and brought back online.
