rxrpc: Drop channel number field from rxrpc_call struct

Drop the channel number (channel) field from the rxrpc_call struct to
reduce the size of the call struct.  The field is redundant: if the call is
attached to a connection, the channel can be obtained from there by AND'ing
with RXRPC_CHANNELMASK.
