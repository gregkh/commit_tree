MIPS: c-r4k: Drop bc_wback_inv() from icache flush

The EVA conditional bc_wback_inv() at the end of flush_icache_range() to
flush the modified code all the way back to RAM was apparently there for
debug purposes and to accommodate the Malta EVA configuration which
makes use of a physical alias, and didn't use the CP0_EBase.WG (Write
Gate) bit to put the exception vector in the same physical alias where
the exception vector code is written and is being flushed.

Now that CP0_EBase.WG is used, lets drop this flush.
