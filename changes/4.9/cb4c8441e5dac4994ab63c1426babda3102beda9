greybus: tracing: define interface traces

Define a new gb_module trace point event class, used to trace events
associated with the interface abstraction.  Define four basic trace
points for this--creation time, drop of last reference, before
registring interfaces and after de-registering them.  In addition,
define traces for activating and deactivating, and enabling and
disabling an interface.
