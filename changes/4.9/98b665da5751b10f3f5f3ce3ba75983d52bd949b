powerpc/powernv/pci: Add PHB register dump debugfs handle

On EEH events the kernel will print a dump of relevant registers.
If EEH is unavailable (i.e. CONFIG_EEH is disabled, a new platform
doesn't have EEH support, etc) this information isn't readily available.

Add a new debugfs handler to trigger a PHB register dump, so that this
information can be made available on demand.
