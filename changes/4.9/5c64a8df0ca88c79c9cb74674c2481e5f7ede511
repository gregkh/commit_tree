sbitmap: don't update the allocation hint on clear after resize

If we have a bunch of high-numbered bits allocated and then we resize
the struct sbitmap_queue, when those bits get cleared, we'll update the
hint and then have to re-randomize it repeatedly. Avoid that by checking
that the cleared bit is still a valid hint. No measurable performance
difference in the common case.
