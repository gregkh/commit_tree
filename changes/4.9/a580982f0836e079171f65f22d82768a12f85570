extcon: Add the synchronization extcon APIs to support the notification

This patch adds the synchronization extcon APIs to support the notifications
for both state and property. When extcon_*_sync() functions is called,
the extcon informs the information from extcon provider to extcon client.

The extcon driver may need to change the both state and multiple properties
at the same time. After setting the data of a external connector,
the extcon send the notification to client driver with the extcon_*_sync().

The list of new extcon APIs as following:
- extcon_sync() : Send the notification for each external connector to
		synchronize the information between extcon provider driver
		and extcon client driver.
- extcon_set_state_sync() : Set the state of external connector with noti.
- extcon_set_property_sync() : Set the property of external connector with noti.

For example,
case 1, change the state of external connector and synchronized the data.
	extcon_set_state_sync(edev, EXTCON_USB, 1);

case 2, change both the state and property of external connector
	and synchronized the data.
	extcon_set_state(edev, EXTCON_USB, 1);
	extcon_set_property(edev, EXTCON_USB, EXTCON_PROP_USB_VBUS 1);
	extcon_sync(edev, EXTCON_USB);

case 3, change the property of external connector and synchronized the data.
	extcon_set_property(edev, EXTCON_USB, EXTCON_PROP_USB_VBUS, 0);
	extcon_sync(edev, EXTCON_USB);

case 4, change the property of external connector and synchronized the data.
	extcon_set_property_sync(edev, EXTCON_USB, EXTCON_PROP_USB_VBUS, 0);
