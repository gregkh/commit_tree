printk: suppress empty continuation lines

We have a fairly common pattern where you print several things as
continuations on one single line in a loop, and then at the end you do

	printk(KERN_CONT "\n");

to flush the buffered output.

But if the output was flushed by something else (concurrent printk
activity, or just system logging), we don't want that final flushing to
just print an empty line.

So just suppress empty continuation lines when they couldn't be merged
into the line they are a continuation of.
