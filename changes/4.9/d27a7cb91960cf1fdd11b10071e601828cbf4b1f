zfcp: trace on request for open and close of WKA port

Since commit a54ca0f62f953898b05549391ac2a8a4dad6482b
("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing for HBA records.")
HBA records no longer contain WWPN, D_ID, or LUN
to reduce duplicate information which is already in REC records.
In contrast to "regular" target ports, we don't use recovery to open
WKA ports such as directory/nameserver, so we don't get REC records.
Therefore, introduce pseudo REC running records without any
actual recovery action but including D_ID of WKA port on open/close.
