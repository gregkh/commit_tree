badblocks: fix overlapping check for clearing

Current bad block clear implementation assumes the range to clear
overlaps with at least one bad block already stored. If given range to
clear precedes first bad block in a list, the first entry is incorrectly
updated.

Check not only if stored block end is past clear block end but also if
stored block start is before clear block end.
