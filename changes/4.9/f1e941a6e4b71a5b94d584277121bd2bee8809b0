greybus: firmware: Fetch es2 VID/PID to distinguish module vendors

The es2 chip doesn't have VID/PID programmed into the hardware and we
need to hack that up to distinguish different modules and their firmware
packages.

This fetches VID/PID (over firmware protocol) for es2 chip only, when
VID/PID already sent during hotplug are 0.

Since only the bootrom contains a firmware protocol cport, this only
affects bootrom's working and not nuttx.
