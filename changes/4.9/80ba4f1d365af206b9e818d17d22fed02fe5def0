mwifiex: fix null pointer deference when adapter is null

If adapter is null the error exit path in mwifiex_shutdown_sw is
to down the semaphore sem and print some debug via mwifiex_dbg.
However, passing a NULL adapter to mwifiex_dbg causes a null
pointer deference when accessing adapter->dev.  This fix checks
for a null adapter at the start of the function and to exit
without the need to up the semaphore and we also skip the debug
to avoid the null pointer dereference.
