greybus: fw-management: Add ioctl to initiate mode-switch

Once the interface firmware is loaded successfully to a module,
userspace can ask it to mode switch to the newly loaded firmware.

This patch provides a new ioctl to initiate mode switch.

Userspace can initiate a mode switch if it has previously loaded the
interface firmware successfully, otherwise the firmware core rejects it.

Also, once the mode-switch is initiated, disallow any more interactions
from the userspace.
