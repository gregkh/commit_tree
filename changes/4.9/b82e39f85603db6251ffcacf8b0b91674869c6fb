[media] pulse8-cec: avoid uninitialized data use

Building with -Wmaybe-uninitialized reveals the use on an uninitialized
variable containing the physical address of the device whenever
firmware before version 2 is used:

drivers/staging/media/pulse8-cec/pulse8-cec.c: In function 'pulse8_connect':
drivers/staging/media/pulse8-cec/pulse8-cec.c:447:2: error: 'pa' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This sets the address to CEC_PHYS_ADDR_INVALID in this case, so we don't
try to write back the uninitialized data to the device.

Fixes: e28a6c8b3fcc ("[media] pulse8-cec: sync configuration with adapter")
