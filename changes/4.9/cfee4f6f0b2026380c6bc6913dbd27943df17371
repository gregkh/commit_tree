x86/mce/AMD: Read MSRs on the CPU allocating the threshold blocks

Scalable MCA systems allow non-core MCA banks to only be accessible by
certain CPUs. The MSRs for these banks are Read-as-Zero on other CPUs.

During allocate_threshold_blocks(), get_block_address() can be scheduled
on CPUs other than the one allocating the block. This causes the MSRs to
be read on the wrong CPU and results in incorrect behavior.

Add a @cpu parameter to get_block_address() and pass this in to ensure
that the MSRs are only read on the CPU that is allocating the block.
