block: implement (some of) fallocate for block devices

After much discussion, it seems that the fallocate feature flag
FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE maps nicely to SCSI WRITE SAME; and the feature
FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE maps nicely to the devices that have been whitelisted
for zeroing SCSI UNMAP.  Punch still requires that FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE is
set.  A length that goes past the end of the device will be clamped to the
device size if KEEP_SIZE is set; or will return -EINVAL if not.  Both
start and length must be aligned to the device's logical block size.

Since the semantics of fallocate are fairly well established already, wire
up the two pieces.  The other fallocate variants (collapse range, insert
range, and allocate blocks) are not supported.
