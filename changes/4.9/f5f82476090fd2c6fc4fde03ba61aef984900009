net/mlx5: E-Switch, Support VLAN actions in the offloads mode

Many virtualization systems use a policy under which a vlan tag is
pushed to packets sent by guests, and popped before the packet is
forwarded to the VM.

The current generation of the mlx5 HW doesn't fully support that on
a per flow level. As such, we are addressing the above common use
case with the SRIOV e-Switch abilities to push vlan into packets
sent by VFs and pop vlan from packets forwarded to VFs.

The HW can match on the correct vlan being present in packets
forwarded to VFs (eSwitch steering is done before stripping
the tag), so this part is offloaded as is.

A common practice for vlans is to avoid both push vlan and pop vlan
for inter-host VM/VM (east-west) communication because in this case,
push on egress cancels out with pop on ingress.

For supporting that, we use a global eswitch vlan pop policy, hence
allowing guest A to communicate with both remote VM B and local VM C.
This works since the HW pops the vlan only if it exists (e.g for
C --> A packets but not for B --> A packets).

On the slow path, when a VF vport has an offloaded flow which involves
pushing vlans, wheres another flow is not currently offloaded, the
packets from the 2nd flow seen by the VF representor on the host have
vlan. The VF rep driver removes such vlan before calling into the host
networking stack.
