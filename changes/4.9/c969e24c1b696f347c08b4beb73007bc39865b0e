libnvdimm, namespace: filter out of range labels in scan_labels()

Short-circuit doomed-to-fail label validation attempts by skipping
labels that are outside the given region.  For example a DIMM that has
multiple PMEM regions will waste time attempting to create namespaces
only to find that the interleave-set-cookie does not validate, e.g.:

    nd_region region6: invalid cookie in label: 73e608dc-47b9-4b2a-b5c7-2d55a32e0c2

Similar to how we skip BLK labels when performing PMEM validation we can
skip out-of-range labels early.
