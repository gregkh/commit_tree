sched: remove qdisc arg from __qdisc_dequeue_head

Moves qdisc stat accouting to qdisc_dequeue_head.

The only direct caller of the __qdisc_dequeue_head version open-codes
this now.

This allows us to later use __qdisc_dequeue_head as a replacement
of __skb_dequeue() (which operates on sk_buff_head list).
