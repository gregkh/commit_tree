btrfs: fix perms on demonstration debugfs interface

btrfs provides a helpful demonstration of how to export
a global variable via debugfs; however, it is unique among
other debugfs files in that it is world-writable, which causes
some concern to people who are not familiar with its purpose.

Fix it so that it is only user-writable.
