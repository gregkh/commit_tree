perf hists: Fix column length on --hierarchy

Markus reported that there's a weird behavior on perf top --hierarchy
regarding the column length.

Looking at the code, I found a dubious code which affects the symptoms.
When --hierarchy option is used, the last column length might be
inaccurate since it skips to update the length on leaf entries.

I cannot remember why it did and looks like a leftover from previous
version during the development.

Anyway, updating the column length often is not harmful.  So let's move
the code out.
