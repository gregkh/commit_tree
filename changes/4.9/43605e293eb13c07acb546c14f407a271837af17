mei: txe: don't clean an unprocessed interrupt cause.

SEC registers are not accessible when the TXE device is in low power
state, hence the SEC interrupt cannot be processed if device is not
awake.

In some rare cases entrance to low power state (aliveness off) and input
ready bits can be signaled at the same time, resulting in communication
stall as input ready won't be signaled again after waking up. To resolve
this IPC_HHIER_SEC bit in HHISR_REG should not be cleaned if the
interrupt is not processed.
