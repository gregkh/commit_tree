HID: intel_ish-hid: ISH Transport layer

The ISH transport layer (ishtp) is a bi-directional protocol implemented
on the top of PCI based inter processor communication layer. This layer
offers:
- Connection management
- Flow control with the firmware
- Multiple client sessions
- Client message transfer
- Client message reception
- DMA for RX and TX for fast data transfer

Refer to Documentation/hid/intel-ish-hid.txt for
