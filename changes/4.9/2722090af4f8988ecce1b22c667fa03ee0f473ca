MIPS: pci: Audit and remove any unnecessary uses of module.h

Historically a lot of these existed because we did not have
a distinction between what was modular code and what was providing
support to modules via EXPORT_SYMBOL and friends.  That changed
when we forked out support for the latter into the export.h file.

This means we should be able to reduce the usage of module.h
in code that is obj-y Makefile or bool Kconfig.  The advantage
in doing so is that module.h itself sources about 15 other headers;
adding significantly to what we feed cpp, and it can obscure what
headers we are effectively using.

Since module.h was the source for init.h (for __init) and for
export.h (for EXPORT_SYMBOL) we consider each obj-y/bool instance
for the presence of either and replace as needed.

We also needed to remove the no-op MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE usage in
several instances to permit removal of the module.h include.  The
files in these instances were all controlled by bool Kconfig.

In one instance, module_param was being used so we transition the
module.h include onto a moduleparam.h include.
