greybus: define operation_cancel()

Define a new function operation_cancel() that cancels an
outstanding operation.  Use it to clear out any operations that
might be pending at the time a connection is torn down.

Note:  This code isn't really functional yet, partially because
greybus_kill_gbuf() is not implemented.
