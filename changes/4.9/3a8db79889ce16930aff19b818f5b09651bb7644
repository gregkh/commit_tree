dlm: free workqueues after the connections

After backporting commit ee44b4bc054a ("dlm: use sctp 1-to-1 API")
series to a kernel with an older workqueue which didn't use RCU yet, it
was noticed that we are freeing the workqueues in dlm_lowcomms_stop()
too early as free_conn() will try to access that memory for canceling
the queued works if any.

This issue was introduced by commit 0d737a8cfd83 as before it such
attempt to cancel the queued works wasn't performed, so the issue was
not present.

This patch fixes it by simply inverting the free order.
