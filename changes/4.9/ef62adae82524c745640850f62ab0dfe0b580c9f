greybus: operation: fix broken activation logic

An operation should only be added to the connection active list if the
connection is in the enabled state, or if it is in the enabled_tx state
and the operation is not incoming.

This fixes a race where an early or late incoming request could be added
to the active list while the connection is being enabled or disabled,
something which could lead to use-after-free issues or worse.

Note that the early connection-state checks in the receive path
limited the impact of this bug.
