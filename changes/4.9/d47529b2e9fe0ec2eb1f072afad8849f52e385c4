gpio: don't include module.h in shared driver header

Most shared headers in include/linux don't need to know what the
internals of a struct module are; all they care about is that it
is a struct and hence they may require a pointer to one.

The advantage in this is that module.h is including a lot of stuff
itself, and an otherwise empty C file that just contains module.h
will result in ~750kB from CPP (compared to say 12kB from init.h)

So we have approximately 50 instances of "struct module;" in the
various include/linux headers already that help us keep module.h
out of other headers; here we do the same for gpio.
