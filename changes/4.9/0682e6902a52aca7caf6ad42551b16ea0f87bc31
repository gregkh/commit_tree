tcp: count packets marked lost for a TCP connection

Count the number of packets that a TCP connection marks lost.

Congestion control modules can use this loss rate information for more
intelligent decisions about how fast to send.

Specifically, this is used in TCP BBR policer detection. BBR uses a
high packet loss rate as one signal in its policer detection and
policer bandwidth estimation algorithm.

The BBR policer detection algorithm cannot simply track retransmits,
because a retransmit can be (and often is) an indicator of packets
lost long, long ago. This is particularly true in a long CA_Loss
period that repairs the initial massive losses when a policer kicks
in.
