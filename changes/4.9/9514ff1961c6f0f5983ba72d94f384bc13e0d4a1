tmp/tpm_crb: fix Intel PTT hw bug during idle state

There is a HW bug in Skylake, and Broxton PCH Intel PTT device, where
most of the registers in the control area except START, REQUEST, CANCEL,
and LOC_CTRL lost retention when the device is in the idle state. Hence
we need to bring the device to ready state before accessing the other
registers. The fix brings device to ready state before trying to read
command and response buffer addresses in order to remap the for access.
