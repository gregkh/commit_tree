libnvdimm: Fix nvdimm_probe error on NVDIMM-N

'ndctl list --buses --dimms' does not list any NVDIMM-Ns since
they are considered as idle.  ndctl checks if any driver is
attached to nmem device.  nvdimm_probe() always fails in
nvdimm_init_nsarea() since NVDIMM-Ns do not implement optinal
ND_CMD_GET_CONFIG_DATA command.

Change nvdimm_probe() to accept the case that the CONFIG_DATA
command is not implemented for NVDIMM-Ns.  The driver attaches
without ndd, which keeps it no-op to the device.
