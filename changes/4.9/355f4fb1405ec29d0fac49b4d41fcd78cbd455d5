kvm: nVMX: VMCLEAR an active shadow VMCS after last use

After a successful VM-entry with the "VMCS shadowing" VM-execution
control set, the shadow VMCS referenced by the VMCS link pointer field
in the current VMCS becomes active on the logical processor.

A VMCS that is made active on more than one logical processor may become
corrupted. Therefore, before an active VMCS can be migrated to another
logical processor, the first logical processor must execute a VMCLEAR
for the active VMCS. VMCLEAR both ensures that all VMCS data are written
to memory and makes the VMCS inactive.
