Drivers: hv: ring_buffer: wrap around mappings for ring buffers

Make it possible to always use a single memcpy() or to provide a direct
link to a packet on the ring buffer by creating virtual mapping for two
copies of the ring buffer with vmap(). Utilize currently empty
hv_ringbuffer_cleanup() to do the unmap.

While on it, replace sizeof(struct hv_ring_buffer) check
in hv_ringbuffer_init() with BUILD_BUG_ON() as it is a compile time check.
