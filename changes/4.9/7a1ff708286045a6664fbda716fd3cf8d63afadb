KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Introduce config option to guard ITS specific code

By now ITS code guarded with KVM_ARM_VGIC_V3 config option which was
introduced to hide everything specific to vgic-v3 from 32-bit world.
We are going to support vgic-v3 in 32-bit world and KVM_ARM_VGIC_V3
will gone, but we don't have support for ITS there yet and we need to
continue keeping ITS away.
Introduce the new config option to prevent ITS code being build in
32-bit mode when support for vgic-v3 is done.
