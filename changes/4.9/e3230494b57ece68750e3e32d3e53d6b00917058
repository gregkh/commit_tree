net: phy: realtek: fix enabling of the TX-delay for RTL8211F

The old logic always enabled the TX-delay when the phy-mode was set to
PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII. There are dedicated phy-modes which tell the
PHY driver to enable the RX and/or TX delays:
- PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII should disable the RX and TX delay in the
  PHY (if required, the MAC should add the delays in this case)
- PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID should enable RX and TX delay in the PHY
- PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID should enable the TX delay in the PHY
- PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_RXID should enable the RX delay in the PHY
  (currently not supported by RTL8211F)

With this patch we enable the TX delay for PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID
and PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID.
Additionally we now explicity disable the TX-delay, which seems to be
enabled automatically after a hard-reset of the PHY (by triggering it's
reset pin) to get a consistent state (as defined by the phy-mode).

This fixes a compatibility problem with some SoCs where the TX-delay was
also added by the MAC. With the TX-delay being applied twice the TX
clock was off and TX traffic was broken or very slow (<10Mbit/s) on
1000Mbit/s links.
