mcb: Added bar descriptor support for non PCI bus MCB carrier

Added support for the bar descriptor. This type is used for FPGAs
connect to the LPC or to a non PCI bus.

The Bar descriptor could have a maximum of 6 BARs. Each of the
devices within the FPGA could be mapped to a different BAR.
The BAR descriptor is comparable to the PCI header.
