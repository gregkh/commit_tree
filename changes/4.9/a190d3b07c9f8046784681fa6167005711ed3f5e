IB/ucma: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

alloc_ordered_workqueue() with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, replaces
deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue(). This is the identity
conversion.

The workqueue "close_wq" queues work items &ctx->close_work (maps to
ucma_close_id) and &con_req_eve->close_work (maps to
ucma_close_event_id). It has been identity converted.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure.
