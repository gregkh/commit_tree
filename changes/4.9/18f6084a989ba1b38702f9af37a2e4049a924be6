scsi: mpt3sas: Fix secure erase premature termination

This is a work around for a bug with LSI Fusion MPT SAS2 when perfoming
secure erase. Due to the very long time the operation takes, commands
issued during the erase will time out and will trigger execution of the
abort hook. Even though the abort hook is called for the specific
command which timed out, this leads to entire device halt
(scsi_state terminated) and premature termination of the secure erase.

Set device state to busy while ATA passthrough commands are in progress.
