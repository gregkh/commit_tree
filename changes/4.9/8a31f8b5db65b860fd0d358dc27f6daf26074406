dmaengine: qcom_hidma: release the descriptor before the callback

There is a race condition between data transfer callback and descriptor
free code. The callback routine may decide to clear the resources even
though the descriptor has not yet been freed.

Instead of calling the callback first and then releasing the memory,
this code is changing the order to return the descriptor back to the
free pool and then call the user provided callback.
