drivers: dma-coherent: Fix DMA coherent size for less than page

We fix a bug in dma_mmap_from_coherent() that appears when we map non page
aligned DMA memory. It cuts off the non aligned part (this is different to
dma_alloc_coherent() that always rounds up to full pages). So for mappings
of less than a page we get -ENXIO as dma_mmap_from_coherent() assumes we
want to map zero pages.
