IB/cxgb3: Move user vendor structures

This patch moves cxgb3 vendor's specific structures to
common UAPI folder which will be visible to all consumers.

These structures are used by user-space library driver
(libcxgb3) and currently manually copied to that library.

This move will allow cross-compile against these files and
simplify introduction of vendor specific data.
