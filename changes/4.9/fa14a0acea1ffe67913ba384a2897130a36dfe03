nvmet-rdma: Fix possible NULL deref when handling rdma cm events

When we initiate queue teardown sequence we call rdma_destroy_qp
which clears cm_id->qp, afterwards we call rdma_destroy_id, but
we might see a rdma_cm event in between with a cleared cm_id->qp
so watch out for that and silently ignore the event because this
means that the queue teardown sequence is in progress.
