drm/i915/guc: use for_each_engine_id() where appropriate

Now that host structures are indexed by host engine-id rather than
guc_id, we can usefully convert some for_each_engine() loops to use
for_each_engine_id() and avoid multiple dereferences of engine->id.

Also a few related tweaks to cache structure members locally wherever
they're used more than once or twice, hopefully eliminating memory
references.
