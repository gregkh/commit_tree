greybus: firmware: fix information leak

Add missing sanity checks on get_firmware-request offset and size
parameters to fix potential information leaks.

This prevents remotely controlled information leaks as the requestor
currently controls both the 32-bit firmware-image offset and the amount
of data that is returned (up to host-device MTU).
