mm/list_lru.c: avoid error-path NULL pointer deref

As described in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177821:

After some analysis it seems to be that the problem is in alloc_super().
In case list_lru_init_memcg() fails it goes into destroy_super(), which
calls list_lru_destroy().

And in list_lru_init() we see that in case memcg_init_list_lru() fails,
lru->node is freed, but not set NULL, which then leads list_lru_destroy()
to believe it is initialized and call memcg_destroy_list_lru().
memcg_destroy_list_lru() in turn can access lru->node[i].memcg_lrus,
which is NULL.
