leds: add PM8058 LEDs driver

This adds a driver for the six PM8058 LEDs, three ordinary LEDs,
two "flash" LEDs and one "keypad" LED.

The "keypad" and "flash" LEDs are not really hard-wired to these
usecases: for example on the APQ8060 Dragonboard, the "keypad"
LED is instead used to drive an IR LED used for the proximity
sensor. The "flash" LEDs are just ordinary high-current LED
drivers.
