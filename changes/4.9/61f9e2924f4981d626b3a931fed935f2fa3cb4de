netfilter: nf_tables: fix *leak* when expr clone fail

When nft_expr_clone failed, a series of problems will happen:

1. module refcnt will leak, we call __module_get at the beginning but
   we forget to put it back if ops->clone returns fail
2. memory will be leaked, if clone fail, we just return NULL and forget
   to free the alloced element
3. set->nelems will become incorrect when set->size is specified. If
   clone fail, we should decrease the set->nelems

Now this patch fixes these problems. And fortunately, clone fail will
only happen on counter expression when memory is exhausted.
