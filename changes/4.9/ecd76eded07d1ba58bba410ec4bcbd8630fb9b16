of/platform: Probe "isa" busses by default

Since commit 44a7185c2ae6 ("of/platform: Add common method to populate
default bus") platforms calling of_platform_bus_probe from an initcall
is either a rather unsafe race with of_platform_default_populate_init or
a no-op. The MIPS Malta board needs to probe devices under an ISA bus,
which we do support in the of_busses array but until now haven't
included in of_default_bus_match_table.

Add an "isa" entry to of_default_bus_match_table such that we can just
accept use of of_platform_default_populate_init & remove the
Malta-specific match table in a later patch.
