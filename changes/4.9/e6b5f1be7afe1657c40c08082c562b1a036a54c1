config: Adding the new config parameter CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING_SMALL for sparc

This new config parameter limits the space used for "Lock debugging:
prove locking correctness" by about 4MB. The current sparc systems have
the limitation of 32MB size for kernel size including .text, .data and
.bss sections. With PROVE_LOCKING feature, the kernel size could grow
beyond this limit and causing system boot-up issues. With this option,
kernel limits the size of the entries of lock_chains, stack_trace etc.,
so that kernel fits in required size limit. This is not visible to user
and only used for sparc.
