mm: consolidate warn_alloc_failed users

warn_alloc_failed is currently used from the page and vmalloc
allocators.  This is a good reuse of the code except that vmalloc would
appreciate a slightly different warning message.  This is already
handled by the fmt parameter except that

  "%s: page allocation failure: order:%u, mode:%#x(%pGg)"

is printed anyway.  This might be quite misleading because it might be a
vmalloc failure which leads to the warning while the page allocator is
not the culprit here.  Fix this by always using the fmt string and only
print the context that makes sense for the particular context (e.g.
order makes only very little sense for the vmalloc context).

Rename the function to not miss any user and also because a later patch
will reuse it also for !failure cases.
