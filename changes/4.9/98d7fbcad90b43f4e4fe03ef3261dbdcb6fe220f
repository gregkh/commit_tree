greybus: manifest: don't reject the interface on failing to initialize a cport

A 'bundle' represents a device in greybus. It may require multiple
cports for its functioning. If we fail to setup any cport of a bundle,
we better reject the complete bundle as the device may not be able to
function properly then.

But, failing to setup a cport of bundle X doesn't mean that the device
corresponding to bundle Y will not work properly. Bundles should be
treated as separate independent devices.

While parsing manifest for an interface, treat bundles as separate
entities and don't reject entire interface and its bundles on failing to
initialize a cport. But make sure the bundle which needs the cport, gets
destroyed properly.

We now release the bundle descriptor before parsing the cports, but that
shouldn't make any difference.
