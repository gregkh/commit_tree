Coccinelle: pm_runtime: ensure relevance of pm_runtime reports

pm_runtime.cocci starts with one rule that searches for a variety of
functions calls, followed by various rules that report errors.  Previously,
the only connection between the first rule and the rest was to check that
the first rule had matched somewhere.  Change the rules to propagate a
position from the first rule to the others, to make sure that the sites
reported on are the same as the sites that were identified as having the
relevant functions.
