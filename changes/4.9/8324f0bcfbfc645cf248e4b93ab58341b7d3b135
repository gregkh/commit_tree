rxrpc: Provide a way for AFS to ask for the peer address of a call

Provide a function so that kernel users, such as AFS, can ask for the peer
address of a call:

   void rxrpc_kernel_get_peer(struct rxrpc_call *call,
			      struct sockaddr_rxrpc *_srx);

In the future the kernel service won't get sk_buffs to look inside.
Further, this allows us to hide any canonicalisation inside AF_RXRPC for
when IPv6 support is added.

Also propagate this through to afs_find_server() and issue a warning if we
can't handle the address family yet.
