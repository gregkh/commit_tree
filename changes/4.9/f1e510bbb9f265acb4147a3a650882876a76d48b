powerpc/boot: Add XZ support to the wrapper script

This modifies the wrapper script so that the -Z option takes an argument
to specify the compression type. It can either be 'gz', 'xz' or 'none'.

The legazy --no-gzip and -z options are still supported and will set the
compression to none and gzip respectively, but they are not documented.

Only XZ -6 is used for compression rather than XZ -9. Using compression
levels higher than 6 requires the decompressor to build a large (64MB)
dictionary when decompressing and some environments cannot satisfy such
large allocations (e.g. POWER 6 LPAR partition firmware).
