nvmem: rockchip-efuse: add rk3399-efuse support

1) the efuse timing of rk3399 is different from earlier SoCs.
2) rk3399-efuse is organized as 32bits by 32 one-time programmable
electrical fuses, the efuse of earlier SoCs is organized as 32bits
by 8 one-time programmable electrical fuses with random access interface.

This patch adds a new read function for rk3399-efuse.
