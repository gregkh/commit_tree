greybus: remove cports and strings from gb_module

We no longer keep copies of strings found in the manifuest in
a module's strings array, so we can get rid of the strings array.
Similarly, the new manifest parsing code sets up connections for
each cport id advertised for a module, so the cport array is
no longer needed either.
