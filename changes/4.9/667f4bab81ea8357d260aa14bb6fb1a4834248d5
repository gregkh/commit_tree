hwmon: (adm9240) handle temperature readings below 0

Unlike the temperature thresholds the temperature data is a 9-bit signed
value. This allows and additional 0.5 degrees of precision on the
reading but makes handling negative values slightly harder. In order to
have sign-extension applied correctly the 9-bit value is stored in the
upper bits of a signed 16-bit value. When presenting this in sysfs the
value is shifted and scaled appropriately.
