KVM: arm64: Fix the issues when guest PMCCFILTR is configured

KVM calls kvm_pmu_set_counter_event_type() when PMCCFILTR is configured.
But this function can't deals with PMCCFILTR correctly because the evtCount
bits of PMCCFILTR, which is reserved 0, conflits with the SW_INCR event
type of other PMXEVTYPER<n> registers. To fix it, when eventsel == 0, this
function shouldn't return immediately; instead it needs to check further
if select_idx is ARMV8_PMU_CYCLE_IDX.

Another issue is that KVM shouldn't copy the eventsel bits of PMCCFILTER
blindly to attr.config. Instead it ought to convert the request to the
"cpu cycle" event type (i.e. 0x11).

To support this patch and to prevent duplicated definitions, a limited
set of ARMv8 perf event types were relocated from perf_event.c to
asm/perf_event.h.
