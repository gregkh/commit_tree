greybus: control: add bundle deactivate and activate operation

Add the AP implementation for the Greybus Control Bundle Deactivate
Operation. This operation requests a Bundle to enter the BUNDLE_OFF
state. All Connections associated with the Bundle must be closed prior
sending this operation.

Add the AP implementation for the Greybus Control Bundle Activate
Operation. This operation requests a specific Bundle to transition from
the BUNDLE_OFF state to the BUNDLE_ACTIVE state.
