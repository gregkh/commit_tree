drm/i915: Convert i915_semaphores_is_enabled over to early sanitize

Rather than recomputing whether semaphores are enabled, we can do that
computation once during early initialisation as the i915.semaphores
module parameter is now read-only.

s/i915_semaphores_is_enabled/i915.semaphores/

v2: Add the state to the debug dmesg as well
