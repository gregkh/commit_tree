net: ethernet: mvneta: Remove IFF_UNICAST_FLT which is not implemented

The mvneta driver advertises it supports IFF_UNICAST_FLT. However, it
actually does not. The hardware probably does support it, but there is
no code to configure the filter. As a quick and simple fix, remove the
flag. This will cause the core to fall back to promiscuous mode.
