ARC: dw2 unwind: switch to .eh_frame based unwinding

So finally after almost 8 years of dealing with .debug_frame, we are
finally switching to .eh_frame. The reason being stripped kernel
binaries had non-functional unwinder as .debug_frame was gone.
Also, in general .eh_frame seems more common way of doing unwinding.

This also folds a revert of f52e126cc747 ("ARC: unwind: ensure that
.debug_frame is generated (vs. .eh_frame)") to ensure that we start
getting .eh_frame
