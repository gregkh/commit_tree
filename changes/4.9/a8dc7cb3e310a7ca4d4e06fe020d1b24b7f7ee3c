Revert "ARM: dts: dra7: Move to operating-points-v2 table"

This reverts commit f80bc97fd0a9711ef11bdb3e63c2c01115a82c47.

The original commit updated the cpufreq operating points tables for
dra7xx but was merged before the driver making use of the node was
merged, which breaks the existing cpufreq implementation on the system,
so revert the patch until the ti-cpufreq driver is merged.
