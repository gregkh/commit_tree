drm/i915: Only change the context object's domain when binding

We know that the only access to the context object is via the GPU, and
the only time when it can be out of the GPU domain is when it is swapped
out and unbound. Therefore we only need to clflush the object when
binding, thus avoiding any potential stall on touching the domain on an
active context.
