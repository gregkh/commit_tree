x86/ioapic: Fix IOAPIC failing to request resource

handle_ioapic_add() uses request_resource() to request ACPI "_CRS"
resources. This can fail with the following error message:

  [  247.325693] ACPI: \_SB_.IIO1.AID1: failed to insert resource

This happens when there are multiple IOAPICs and DSDT groups their
"_CRS" resources as the children of a parent resource, as seen from
/proc/iomem:

  fec00000-fecfffff : PNP0003:00
    fec00000-fec003ff : IOAPIC 0
    fec01000-fec013ff : IOAPIC 1
    fec40000-fec403ff : IOAPIC 2

In this case request_resource() fails because there's a conflicting
resource which is the parent (fec0000-fecfffff). Fix it by using
insert_resource() which can request resources by taking the conflicting
resource as the parent.
