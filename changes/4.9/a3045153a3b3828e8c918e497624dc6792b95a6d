[media] subdev-formats.rst: adjust tables size for LaTeX output

There are two big tables here that are very hard to adjust its
size.

The first one would fit into one page, but the latex.py logic
at Sphinx auto-switches to longtable when there are more than 30
rows. There's no way to override without coding.

The second one is really big, and won't fit on a single page.
So, it has to use tiny font to fit.
