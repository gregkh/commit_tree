greybus: loopback: Convert cross-thread mutex to spinlock while relaxing connect locks

This patch converts the cross-thread mutex used to synchronize threads with
respect to each other to a spinlock. This is done to enable taking of locks
in the following patches while in atomic context. A small re-order of
locking in connection setup/tear-down is done to minimize the amount of
time spent in spinlock_irqsave().
