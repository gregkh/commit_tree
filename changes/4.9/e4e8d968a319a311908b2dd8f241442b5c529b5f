Staging: ks7010: remove unused function in ks_wlan_net.c

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/staging/ks7010/ks_wlan_net.c:3520:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'ks_wlan_reset' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, these functions are unused in
ks_wlan_net.c, but should be removed.

So this patch removes the unused function.
