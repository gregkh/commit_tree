efi/runtime-map: Use efi.memmap directly instead of a copy

Now that efi.memmap is available all of the time there's no need to
allocate and build a separate copy of the EFI memory map.

Furthermore, efi.memmap contains boot services regions but only those
regions that have been reserved via efi_mem_reserve(). Using
efi.memmap allows us to pass boot services across kexec reboot so that
the ESRT and BGRT drivers will now work.
