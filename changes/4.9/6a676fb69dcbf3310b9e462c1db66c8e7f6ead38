i2c: mark device nodes only in case of successful instantiation

Instantiated I2C device nodes are marked with OF_POPULATE. This was
introduced in 4f001fd30145a6. On unloading, loaded device nodes will of
course be unmarked. The problem are nodes that fail during
initialisation: If a node fails, it won't be unloaded and hence not be
unmarked.

If a I2C driver module is unloaded and reloaded, it will skip nodes that
failed before.

Skip device nodes that are already populated and mark them only in case
of success.
