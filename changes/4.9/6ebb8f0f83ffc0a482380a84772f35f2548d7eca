usb: ohci-sa1111: remove machine_has_neponset()

The neponset is a daughter board for the Assabet platform, which has a
SA1111 chip on it.  If we're initialising the SA1111 OHCI, and we're
part of a neponset, the host platform must be an Assabet.

This allows us to eliminate machine_has_neponset() from this driver,
replacing it instead with machine_is_assabet(), and killing the
mach/assabet.h include.
