parisc: Fix kernel memory layout regarding position of __gp

Architecturally we need to keep __gp below 0x1000000.

But because of ftrace and tracepoint support, the RO_DATA_SECTION now gets much
bigger than it was before. By moving the linkage tables before RO_DATA_SECTION
we can avoid that __gp gets positioned at a too high address.
