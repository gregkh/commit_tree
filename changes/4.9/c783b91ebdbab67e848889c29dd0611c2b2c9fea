s390: add assembler include path for vx-insn.h

With git commit 0eab11c7e0d30de14a15ccd8269eef238321a8e1
"s390/vx: allow to include vx-insn.h with .include"
and an older gcc we get errors like this:

{standard input}:6: Error: can't open asm/vx-insn.h for reading:
No such file or directory
arch/s390/kernel/fpu.c:57: Error: Unrecognized opcode: `vstm'

To solve this issue simply add the path to arch/s390/include to
all assembler runs.
