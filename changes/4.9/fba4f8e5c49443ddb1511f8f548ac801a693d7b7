iommu/arm-smmu: Work around ARM DMA configuration

The 32-bit ARM DMA configuration code predates the IOMMU core's default
domain functionality, and instead relies on allocating its own domains
and attaching any devices using the generic IOMMU binding to them.
Unfortunately, it does this relatively early on in the creation of the
device, before we've seen our add_device callback, which leads us to
attempt to operate on a half-configured master.

To avoid a crash, check for this situation on attach, but refuse to
play, as there's nothing we can do. This at least allows VFIO to keep
working for people who update their 32-bit DTs to the generic binding,
albeit with a few (innocuous) warnings from the DMA layer on boot.
