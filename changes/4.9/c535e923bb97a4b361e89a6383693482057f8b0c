soc/fsl: Introduce DPAA 1.x QMan device driver

This driver enables the Freescale DPAA 1.x Queue Manager block.
QMan is a hardware accelerator that manages frame queues.  It allows
CPUs and other accelerators connected to the SoC datapath to enqueue
and dequeue ethernet frames, thus providing the infrastructure for
data exchange among CPUs and datapath accelerators.
