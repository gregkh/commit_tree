drm/i915: Reduce i915_gem_objects to only show object information

No longer is knowing how much of the GTT (both mappable aperture and
beyond) relevant, and the output clutters the real information - that is
how many objects are allocated and bound (and by who) so that we can
quickly grasp if there is a leak.

v2: Relent, and rename pinned to indicate display only. Since the
display objects are semi-static and are of variable size, they are the
interesting objects to watch over time for aperture leaking. The other
pins are either static (such as the scratch page) or very short lived
(such as execbuf) and not part of the precious GGTT.
