KVM: MIPS: Override HVA error values for EVA

MIPS Enhanced Virtual Addressing (EVA) allows the user mode and kernel
mode address spaces to overlap, breaking the assumption that PAGE_OFFSET
is an appropriate KVM HVA error value, since PAGE_OFFSET may be as low
as zero.

Fix this in the same way that s390 does in commit bf640876e21f ("KVM:
s390: Make KVM_HVA_ERR_BAD usable on s390"), by overriding
KVM_HVA_ERR_[RO_]BAD and kvm_is_error_hva() in asm/kvm_host.h.
