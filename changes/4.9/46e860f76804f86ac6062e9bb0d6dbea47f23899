ALSA: rename TLV-related macros so that they're friendly to user applications

In a previous commit, some macros newly appeared to UAPI header for TLV
packet. These macros have short names and they easily bring name conflist
to applications. The conflict can be avoided to rename them with a proper
prefix.

For this purpose, this commit renames these macros with prefix
'SNDRV_CTL_TLVD_'.
