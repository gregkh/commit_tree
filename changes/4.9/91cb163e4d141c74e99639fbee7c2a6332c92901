arm64: sysreg: Fix use of XZR in write_sysreg_s

Commit 8a71f0c656e0 ("arm64: sysreg: replace open-coded mrs_s/msr_s with
{read,write}_sysreg_s") introduced a write_sysreg_s macro for writing
to system registers that are not supported by binutils.

Unfortunately, this was implemented with the wrong template (%0 vs %x0),
so in the case that we are writing a constant 0, we will generate
invalid instruction syntax and bail with a cryptic assembler error:

  | Error: constant expression required

This patch fixes the template.
