coresight: etm-perf: pass struct perf_event to source::enable/disable()

With this commit [1] address range filter information is now found
in the struct hw_perf_event::addr_filters.  As such pass the event
itself to the coresight_source::enable/disable() functions so that
both event attribute and filter can be accessible for configuration.
