batman-adv: Avoid sysfs name collision for netns moves

The kobject_put is only removing the sysfs entry and corresponding entries
when its reference counter becomes zero. This tends to lead to collisions
when a device is moved between two different network namespaces because
some of the sysfs files have to be removed first and then added again to
the already moved sysfs entry.

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 290 at lib/kobject.c:240 kobject_add_internal+0x5ec/0x8a0
    kobject_add_internal failed for batman_adv with -EEXIST, don't try to register things with the same name in the same directory.

But the caller of kobject_put can already remove the sysfs entry before it
does the kobject_put. This removal is done even when the reference counter
is not yet zero and thus avoids the problem.
