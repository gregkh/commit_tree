greybus: add num_cports field to greybus hd

This commit is doing the preparation work in order to get the number of cports
supported from the UniPro IP instead of using a constant defined in a Kconfig
file.

Greybus host device is now holding the cport count, and all the code will now
use this value instead of the constant CPORT_ID_MAX when referring to an AP's
CPort ID.
