ath10k: fix rfc1042 header retrieval in QCA4019 with eth decap mode

Chipset from QCA99X0 onwards (QCA99X0, QCA9984, QCA4019 & future)
rx_hdr_status is not padded to align in 4-byte boundary. Define a
new hw_params field to handle different alignment behaviour between
different hw. This patch fixes improper retrieval of rfc1042 header
with QCA4019. This patch along with "ath10k: Properly remove padding
from the start of rx payload" will fix traffic failure in ethernet
decap mode for QCA4019.
