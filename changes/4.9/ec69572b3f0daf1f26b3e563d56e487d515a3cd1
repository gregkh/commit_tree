PM / Domains: Add new helper functions for device-tree

Ideally, if we are returning a reference to a PM domain via a call to
of_genpd_get_from_provider(), then we should keep track of such
references via a reference count. The reference count could then be used
to determine if a PM domain can be safely removed. Alternatively, it is
possible to avoid such external references by providing APIs to access
the PM domain and hence, eliminate any calls to
of_genpd_get_from_provider().

Add new helper functions for adding a device and a subdomain to a PM
domain when using device-tree, so that external calls to
of_genpd_get_from_provider() can be removed.
