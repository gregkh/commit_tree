drm/vmwgfx: Avoid validating views on view destruction

When a view destruction command was present in the command stream, the
view was validated to avoid a device error. That caused excessive and
unnecessary validations of views, surfaces and mobs on view destruction.

Replace this with a new relocation type that patches the view
destruction command to a NOP if the view is not present in the device
after the execbuf validation sequence.

Also add checks for the member size of the vmw_res_relocation struct.

Fixes sporadic command submission errors on google-earth exit.
