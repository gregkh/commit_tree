spi: pxa2xx: Add support for GPIO descriptor chip selects

The driver uses custom chip_info coming from platform data for chip selects
implemented as GPIOs. If the system lacks board files setting up the
platform data, it is not possible to use GPIOs as chip selects.

This adds support for GPIO descriptors so that regardless of the underlying
firmware interface (DT, ACPI or platform data) the driver can request GPIOs
used as chip selects and configure them accordingly.

The custom chip_info GPIO support is still left there to make sure the
existing systems keep working as expected.
