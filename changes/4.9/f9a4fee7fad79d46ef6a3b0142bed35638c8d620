greybus: gb-audio: Activate TX CPort in PCM workqueue

Currently, the I2S TX CPort is configured and activated during
the Greybus audio initialization.  Unfortunately, this prevents
the audio driver from ever changing the I2S configuration.

To allow the I2S configuration to change according to ASOC requests,
move the CPort activation & deactivation to the audio-pcm workqueue.
Now, when audio is running but the CPort is not active, it will be
activated.  When audio is not running and the CPort is active, it
will be deactivated.

This has the side-effect of sending the first piece of audio data
immediately after activating the CPort which is really how it should
work anyway.
