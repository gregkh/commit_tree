greybus: operation: fix response-cancellation race

Make sure the request handler has submitted the response before
cancelling it during operation cancellation.

This prevents cancelling not-yet-submitted messages. It currently also
avoids us ending up with an active message on a stalled connection (e.g.
due to E2EFC).

Note that the call to gb_operation_result_set() is now redundant but is
kept as a precaution to guarantee that a response has indeed been
allocated as part of response submission.
