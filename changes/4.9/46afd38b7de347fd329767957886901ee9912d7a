spi: fsl-espi: align register access with other drivers

Change register access to the method used in other drivers too.
- use register names as in the chip spec for constants
- avoid hard to read statements like
  __be32 __iomem *espi_mode = &reg_base->mode
- get rid of old powerpc-specific functions like in_8

In addition annotate reg_base in struct mpc8xxx_spi as __iomem.
