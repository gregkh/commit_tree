drm/i915: Move setting of request->batch into its single callsite

request->batch_obj is only set by execbuffer for the convenience of
debugging hangs. By moving that operation to the callsite, we can
simplify all other callers and future patches. We also move the
complications of reference handling of the request->batch_obj next to
where the active tracking is set up for the request.
