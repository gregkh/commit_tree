ACPI/PCI: pci_link: Include PIRQ_PENALTY_PCI_USING for ISA IRQs

Commit 103544d86976 ("ACPI,PCI,IRQ: reduce resource requirements")
replaced the addition of PIRQ_PENALTY_PCI_USING in acpi_pci_link_allocate()
with an addition in acpi_irq_pci_sharing_penalty(), but f7eca374f000
("ACPI,PCI,IRQ: separate ISA penalty calculation") removed the use
of acpi_irq_pci_sharing_penalty() for ISA IRQs.

Therefore, PIRQ_PENALTY_PCI_USING is missing from ISA IRQs used by
interrupt links.  Include that penalty by adding it in the
acpi_pci_link_allocate() path.

Fixes: f7eca374f000 (ACPI,PCI,IRQ: separate ISA penalty calculation)
