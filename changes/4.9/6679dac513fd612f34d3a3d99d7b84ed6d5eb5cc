x86/pkeys: Update documentation

There are a few items that have gotten stale in the protection
keys documentation.  The config option description only applied
to the execute-only support and is not accurate for the current
code.  There was also a typo with the number of system calls.  I
also wanted to call out that pkey_set() is not a kernel-provided
facility, and where to find an implementation.
