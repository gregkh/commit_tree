ALSA: usb-line6: use the same declaration as definition in header for MIDI manufacturer ID

Currently, usb-line6 module exports an array of MIDI manufacturer ID and
usb-pod module uses it. However, the declaration is not the definition in
common header. The difference is explicit length of array. Although
compiler calculates it and everything goes well, it's better to use the
same representation between definition and declaration.

This commit fills the length of array for usb-line6 module. As a small
good sub-effect, this commit suppress below warnings from static analysis
by sparse v0.5.0.
