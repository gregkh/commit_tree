hung_task: allow hung_task_panic when hung_task_warnings is 0

Previously hung_task_panic would not be respected if enabled after
hung_task_warnings had already been decremented to 0.

Permit the kernel to panic if hung_task_panic is enabled after
hung_task_warnings has already been decremented to 0 and another task
hangs for hung_task_timeout_secs seconds.

Check if hung_task_panic is enabled so we don't return prematurely, and
check if hung_task_warnings is non-zero so we don't print the warning
unnecessarily.
