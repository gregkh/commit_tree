greybus: short message is OK for errors

We enforce a rule that a response message must completely fill the
buffer that's been allocated to hold it.  However, if an error
occurs, the payload is off limits, so we should allow a short
message to convey an error result.

Change gb_connection_recv_response() to require the right message
size only if there's no error.

One other thing:  The arriving data is only being copied into the
response buffer if the request was successful.  That means the
response message header is assumed to have been initialized.  That
isn't a valid assumption.  So change it so that if an error is
seen, the header portion of the message is copied into the
response buffer--but only the header.
