pipe: cap initial pipe capacity according to pipe-max-size limit

This is a patch that provides behavior that is more consistent, and
probably less surprising to users. I consider the change optional, and
welcome opinions about whether it should be applied.

By default, pipes are created with a capacity of 64 kiB.  However,
/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size may be set smaller than this value.  In this
scenario, an unprivileged user could thus create a pipe whose initial
capacity exceeds the limit. Therefore, it seems logical to cap the
initial pipe capacity according to the value of pipe-max-size.

The test program shown earlier in this patch series can be used to
demonstrate the effect of the change brought about with this patch:

    # cat /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
    1048576
    # sudo -u mtk ./test_F_SETPIPE_SZ 1
    Initial pipe capacity: 65536
    # echo 10000 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
    # cat /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
    16384
    # sudo -u mtk ./test_F_SETPIPE_SZ 1
    Initial pipe capacity: 16384
    # ./test_F_SETPIPE_SZ 1
    Initial pipe capacity: 65536

The last two executions of 'test_F_SETPIPE_SZ' show that pipe-max-size
caps the initial allocation for a new pipe for unprivileged users, but
not for privileged users.
