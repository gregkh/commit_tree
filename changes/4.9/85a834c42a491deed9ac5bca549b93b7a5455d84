pwm: sti: It's now valid for number of PWM channels to be zero

Setting up the STI PWM IP as capture only, with zero PWM output devices
is a perfectly valid configuration. It is no longer okay to assume that
there must be at least 1 PWM output device. In this patch we make the
default number of PWM output devices zero and only configure channels
explicitly requested.
