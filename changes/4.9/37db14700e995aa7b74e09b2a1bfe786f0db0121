drm/i915: Disable waitboosting for a saturated engine

If the user floods the GPU with so many requests that the engine stalls
waiting for free space, don't automatically promote the GPU to maximum
frequencies. If the GPU really is saturated with work, it will migrate
to high clocks by itself, otherwise it is merely a user flooding us with
busy-work.
