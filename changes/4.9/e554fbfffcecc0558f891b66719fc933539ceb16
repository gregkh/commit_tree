staging: lustre: statahead: use dcache-like interface for sa entry

Rename ll_sa_entry to sa_entry, and manage sa_entry cache with
dcache-like interfaces.

sa_entry is not needed to be refcounted, because only scanner
can free it, so after it's put in stat list, statahead thread
shouldn't access it any longer.

ll_statahead_interpret() doesn't need to take sai refcount,
because statahead thread will wait for all inflight RPC to
finish.
