greybus: only build arche platform driver if usb3613 is enabled

The build is broken if you try to build the arche platform driver
without the usb3163 driver enabled at the same time, so specify that
dependency in the greybus Makefile.

Testing done: 	built inside and outside of the build system against
		many different kernel versions.
