virtio_ring: Make interrupt suppression spec compliant

According to the spec, if the VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX feature bit is
negotiated the driver MUST set flags to 0. Not dirtying the available
ring in virtqueue_disable_cb also has a minor positive performance
impact, improving L1 dcache load missed by ~0.5% in vring_bench.

Writes to the used event field (vring_used_event) are still unconditional.
