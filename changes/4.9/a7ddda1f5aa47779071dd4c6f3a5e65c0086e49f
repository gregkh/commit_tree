greybus: arche-platfrom: Get rid of 2sec delay in USB3613 configuration

Earlier during boot sequence implementation, we had seen race between
USb3613 and APB boot, and since APB boot time is ~2sec, we delayed
USb3613 configuration for 2sec after APB deassertion of reset.

This obviously won't work in the case of suspend/resume, where we would
like to put APB into OFF state and coldboot in resume.

With the latest FW changes, we do not see any race issue. I have done
regression testing (> 50 iteration of reboot + unipro link up and down)
without any issues.

So lets get rid of the 2sec delay with this patch.

Testing Done: Tested on EVT 1.5 platform.
