greybus: timesync: Enforce TimeSync locks as subordinate to Interface locks

gb_timesync_svc_teardown() is called from gb_timesync_svc_del() and issues a
command to a remote Interface to switch off its timers. The lock ordering
is TimeSync => Interface in this case. However gb_module_del() takes an
Interface lock then calls gb_interface_del() => gb_timesync_svc_del() in
this case the lock ordering is Interface => TimeSync.

This patch fixes by removing the taking of the Interface mutex in
gb_interface_timesync_do_something(). If an Interface is present in the
TimeSync linked-list - it is by definition intf->enabled.
