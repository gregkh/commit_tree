kbuild: fix building bzImage with CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS enabled

When building a specific target such as bzImage, modules aren't normally
built.  However if CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS is enabled, no built modules
means none of the exported symbols are used and therefore they will all
be trimmed away from the final kernel.  A subsequent "make modules" will
fail because modpost cannot find the needed symbols for those modules in
the kernel binary.

Let's make sure modules are also built whenever CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS
is enabled and that the kernel binary is properly rebuilt accordingly.
