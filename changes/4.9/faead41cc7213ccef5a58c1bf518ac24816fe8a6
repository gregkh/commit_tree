iwlwifi: pcie: mark command queue lock with separate lockdep class

Emmanuel reports that when CMD_WANT_ASYNC_CALLBACK is used by mvm,
the callback will be called with the command queue lock held, and
mvm will try to stop all (other) TX queues, which acquires their
locks - this caused a false lockdep recursive locking report.

Suppress this report by marking the command queue lock with a new,
separate, lock class so lockdep can tell the difference between
the two types of queues.
