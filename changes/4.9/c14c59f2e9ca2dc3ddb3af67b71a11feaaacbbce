ASoC: ak4104: Limit the supported sample rates

Currently the driver exposes range of sample rates between 8KHz to
192KHz as a part of dai_driver. This does not hold true as the limited
number sample rates are allowed in hw_params DAI callback. This patch
limits the sample rates exposed via dai_driver.
