rpmsg: Introduce Qualcomm SMD backend

This introduces a new rpmsg backend for the Qualcomm SMD system,
allowing communication with various remote processors found in Qualcomm
platforms. The implementation is based on, and intends to replace,
drivers/soc/qcom/smd.c with the necessary adaptions for fitting with the
rpmsg core.
