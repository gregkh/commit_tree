xfs: normalize "infinite" retries in error configs

As it stands today, the "fail immediately" vs. "retry forever"
values for max_retries and retry_timeout_seconds in the xfs metadata
error configurations are not consistent.

A retry_timeout_seconds of 0 means "retry forever," but a
max_retries of 0 means "fail immediately."

retry_timeout_seconds < 0 is disallowed, while max_retries == -1
means "retry forever."

Make this consistent across the error configs, such that a value of
0 means "fail immediately" (i.e. wait 0 seconds, or retry 0 times),
and a value of -1 always means "retry forever."

This makes retry_timeout a signed long to accommodate the -1, even
though it stores jiffies.  Given our limit of a 1 day maximum
timeout, this should be sufficient even at much higher HZ values
than we have available today.
