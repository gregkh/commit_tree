greybus: interface: Update gb_create_control_connection() to support SVC protocol

We need to create bundle/connection for svc cport after the endo layout
and interface id is known to the AP. gb_create_control_connection() can
be reused for this, but it should be renamed to something more
appropriate, as its not about control-connection anymore.

Lets name it gb_create_bundle_connection().
