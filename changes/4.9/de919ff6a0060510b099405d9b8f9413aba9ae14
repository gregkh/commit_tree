i2c: octeon: Avoid sending STOP during recovery

Due to a bug in the ThunderX I2C hardware sending STOP during
a recovery attempt could lock up the hardware. To work around
this problem do not send STOP at the beginning of the recovery
but use the override registers to bring the TWSI including
the high-level controller out of the bad state.
