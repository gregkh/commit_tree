greybus: fix module setup

The code that was setting up a module was not properly initializing
the module data structure.  Fixing this required a little rework.

Now gb_add_module() (which the host device pointer and module id)
allocates and initializes the structure, and passes it to
gb_manifest_parse() for populating it further.
