ftrace: Ignore FTRACE_FL_DISABLED while walking dyn_ftrace records

ftrace_shutdown() checks for sanity of ftrace records
and if dyn_ftrace->flags is not zero, it will warn.
It can happen that 'flags' are set to FTRACE_FL_DISABLED at this point,
since some module was loaded, but before ftrace_module_enable()
cleared the flags for this module.

In other words the module.c is doing:
ftrace_module_init(mod); // calls ftrace_update_code() that sets flags=FTRACE_FL_DISABLED
... // here ftrace_shutdown() is called that warns, since
err = prepare_coming_module(mod); // didn't have a chance to clear FTRACE_FL_DISABLED

Fix it by ignoring disabled records.
It's similar to what __ftrace_hash_rec_update() is already doing.
