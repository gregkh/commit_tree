net: hns: fix the bug of forwarding table

As the sub queue id in the broadcast forwarding table is always
set to absolute queue 0 rather than the interface's relative queue 0,
this will cause the received broadcast packets loopback to rcb.
This patch sets the sub queue id to relative queue 0 of each port.
