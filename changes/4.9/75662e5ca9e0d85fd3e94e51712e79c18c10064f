greybus: connection: Allow a bundle-less connection

We need a bundle-less connection for AP's SVC protocol, as that will be
used much before the endo layout and interface-id of the AP is known to
greybus core.

This updates gb_connection_create_range() to take few more arguments,
which were earlier fetched from the 'bundle' pointer.
