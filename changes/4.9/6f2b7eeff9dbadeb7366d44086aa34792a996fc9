arm64: cpufeature: constify arm64_ftr_regs array

Constify the arm64_ftr_regs array, by moving the mutable arm64_ftr_reg
fields out of the array itself. This also streamlines the bsearch, since
the entire array can be covered by fewer cachelines. Moving the payload
out of the array also allows us to have special explicitly defined
struct instance in case other code needs to refer to it directly.

Note that this replaces the runtime sorting of the array with a runtime
BUG() check whether the array is sorted correctly in the code.
