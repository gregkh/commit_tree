drm: Declare that create drm_mm nodes with size 0 is illegal

At a higher level, all objects are created with definite size i.e. 0 is
illegal. In forthcoming patches, this assumption is dependent upon in
the drm_mm range manager, i.e. trying to create a drm_mm node with size
0 will have undefined behaviour. Add a couple of WARNs upon creating the
drm_mm node to prevent later bugs.
