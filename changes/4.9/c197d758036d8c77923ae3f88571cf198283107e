cpufreq: CPPC: Correct desired_perf calculation

The desired_perf is an abstract performance number. Its value should
be in the range of [lowest perf, highest perf] of CPPC.
The correct calculation is
  desired_perf = freq * cppc_highest_perf / cppc_dmi_max_khz

And cppc_cpufreq_set_target() returns if desired_perf is exactly
the same with the old perf.
