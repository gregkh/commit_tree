KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Kick VCPUs when queueing already pending IRQs

In cases like IPI, we could be queueing an interrupt for a VCPU
that is already running and is not about to exit, because the
VCPU has entered the VM with the interrupt pending and would
not trap on EOI'ing that interrupt. This could result to delays
in interrupt deliveries or even loss of interrupts.
To guarantee prompt interrupt injection, here we have to try to
kick the VCPU.
