ASoC: dapm: Fix possible uninitialized variable in snd_soc_dapm_get_volsw()

If soc_dapm_read() fails, val will be uninitialized, and bogus values
will be written later:

	ret = soc_dapm_read(dapm, reg, &val);
	val = (val >> shift) & mask;

However, the compiler does not give a warning. Return on error before
val is really used to avoid this.

This is similar to the commit 6912831623c5 ("ASoC: dapm: Fix
uninitialized variable in snd_soc_dapm_get_enum_double()")
