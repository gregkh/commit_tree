ASoC: rsrc-card: rename rsrc-card to simple-scu-card phase3

rsrc-card which is using DPCM feature was created for Renesas sound.
But not only Renesas, but many SoC can use this driver, because
it is based on simple-card driver.
To use it as more open driver, rsrc-card will be renamed to
simple-scu-card. In order to easy patch review, as 3rd step,
this patch moves rsrc-card driver to generic folder.
