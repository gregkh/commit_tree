ASoC: uapi: Intel: Skylake: Define vendor specific tokens

With recent topology changes in alsa-lib, driver data for
modules can now be passed in topology conf file using tuples.

This patch defines vendor specific tokens to describe private
data with tuples.

The allowed token types are UUID, string, bool, byte, short and
word. These tokens will be referenced by the vendor tuples in
the conf file.

In the topology conf file, multiple data blocks can be defined
for a widget which can be either tuple vendor array or blob. So,
each data block will be preceded by a descriptor to identify
size and type of block. These descriptors will be token
value pairs.

Tokens for module_id and loadable flag are not defined as these
are read from the DSP FW manifest.
