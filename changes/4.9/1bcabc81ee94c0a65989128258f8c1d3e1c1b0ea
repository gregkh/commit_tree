netfilter: nf_ct_sip: allow tab character in SIP headers

Current parsing methods for SIP headers do not allow the presence of
tab characters between header name and header value. As a result Call-ID
SIP headers like the following are discarded by IPVS SIP persistence
engine:

"Call-ID\t: mycallid@abcde"
"Call-ID:\tmycallid@abcde"

In above examples Call-IDs are represented as strings in C language.
Obviously in real message we have byte "09" before/after colon (":").

Proposed fix is in nf_conntrack_sip module.
Function sip_skip_whitespace() should skip tabs in addition to spaces,
since in SIP grammar whitespace (WSP) corresponds to space or tab.

Below is an extract of relevant SIP ABNF syntax.

Call-ID  =  ( "Call-ID" / "i" ) HCOLON callid
callid   =  word [ "@" word ]

HCOLON  =  *( SP / HTAB ) ":" SWS
SWS     =  [LWS] ; sep whitespace
LWS     =  [*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP ; linear whitespace
WSP     =  SP / HTAB
word    =  1*(alphanum / "-" / "." / "!" / "%" / "*" /
           "_" / "+" / "`" / "'" / "~" /
           "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" /
           ":" / "\" / DQUOTE /
           "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" /
           "{" / "}" )
