drm/i915/gen9: minimum scanlines for Y tile is not always 4

During watermarks calculations, this value is used in 3 different
places. Only one of them was not using a hardcoded 4. Move the code up
so everybody can benefit from the actual value.

This should only help on situations with Y tiling + 90/270 rotation +
1 or 2 bpp or NV12.
