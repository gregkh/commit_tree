dma-buf/sync_file: only enable fence signalling on poll()

Signalling doesn't need to be enabled at sync_file creation, it is only
required if userspace waiting the fence to signal through poll().

Thus we delay fence_add_callback() until poll is called. It only adds the
callback the first time poll() is called. This avoid re-adding the same
callback multiple times.

v2: rebase and update to work with new fence support for sync_file

v3: use atomic operation to set enabled and protect fence_add_callback()

v4: use user bit from fence flags (comment from Chris Wilson)

v5: use ternary if on poll return (comment from Chris Wilson)
