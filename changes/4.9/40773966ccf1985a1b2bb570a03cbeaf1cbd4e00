openvswitch: fix flow stats accounting when node 0 is not possible

On a system with only node 1 as possible, all statistics is going to be
accounted on node 0 as it will have a single writer.

However, when getting and clearing the statistics, node 0 is not going
to be considered, as it's not a possible node.

Tested that statistics are not zero on a system with only node 1
possible. Also compile-tested with CONFIG_NUMA off.
