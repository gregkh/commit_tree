clk: migrate ref counts when orphans are reunited

It's always nice to see families reunited, and this is equally true when
talking about parent clocks and their children. However, if the orphan
clk had a positive prepare_count or enable_count, then we would not
migrate those counts up the parent chain correctly.

This has manifested with the recent critical clocks feature, which often
enables clocks very early, before their parents have been registered.

Fixed by replacing the call to clk_core_reparent with calls to
__clk_set_parent_{before,after}.
