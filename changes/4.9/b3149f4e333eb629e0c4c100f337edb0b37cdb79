nvmem: rockchip-efuse: update compatible strings for Rockchip efuse

Rk3399-efuse is organized as 32bits by 32 one-time programmable electrical
fuses. The efuse of earlier SoCs are organized as 32bits by 8 one-time
programmable electrical fuses with random access interface.

Add different device tree compatible string for different SoCs to be able
to differentiate between the two. The old binding is of course preserved,
though deprecated.
