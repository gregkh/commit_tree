mfd: intel_msic: Make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/mfd/Kconfig:config MFD_INTEL_MSIC
drivers/mfd/Kconfig:    bool "Intel MSIC

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple instances of module references, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
