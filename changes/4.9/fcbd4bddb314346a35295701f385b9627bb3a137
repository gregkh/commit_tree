i2c: uniphier-f: fix misdetection of incomplete STOP condition

Currently, the status register FI2C_SR is checked immediately after
a STOP condition is issued in case of the deferred STOP condition.
It takes typically 5-10 usec until the corresponding bits in the
register are set, so the error check for "stop condition was not
completed" is very likely to be false positive.

Add wait code to relax the status register check.
