xen-netback: (re-)create a debugfs node for hash information

It is useful to be able to see the hash configuration when running tests.
This patch adds a debugfs node for that purpose.

The original version of this patch (commit c0c64c152389) was reverted due
to build failures caused by a conflict with commit 0364a8824c02
("xen-netback: switch to threaded irq for control ring"). This new version
of the patch is nearly identical to the original, the only difference
being that creation of the debugfs node is predicated on 'ctrl_irq' being
non-zero rather then the now non-existent 'ctrl_task'.
