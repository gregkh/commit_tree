ip6_tunnel: Clear IP6CB in ip6tunnel_xmit()

skb->cb may contain data from previous layers. In the observed scenario,
the garbage data were misinterpreted as IP6CB(skb)->frag_max_size, so
that small packets sent through the tunnel are mistakenly fragmented.

This patch unconditionally clears the control buffer in ip6tunnel_xmit(),
which affects ip6_tunnel, ip6_udp_tunnel and ip6_gre. Currently none of
these tunnels set IP6CB(skb)->flags, otherwise it needs to be done earlier.
