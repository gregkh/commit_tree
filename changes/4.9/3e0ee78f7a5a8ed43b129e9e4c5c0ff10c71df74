xfs: optimize xfs_reflink_cancel_cow_blocks

Rewrite xfs_reflink_cancel_cow_blocks so that we only do a search for
the first extent in the extent list and then iterate over the remaining
extents using the extent index, passing the extent we operate on
directly to xfs_bmap_del_extent_delay or xfs_bmap_del_extent_cow instead
of going through xfs_bunmapi and doing yet another extent list lookup.
