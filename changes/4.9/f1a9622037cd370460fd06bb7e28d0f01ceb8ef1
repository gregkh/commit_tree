fs/super.c: don't fool lockdep in freeze_super() and thaw_super() paths

sb_wait_write()->percpu_rwsem_release() fools lockdep to avoid the
false-positives. Now that xfs was fixed by Dave's commit dbad7c993053
("xfs: stop holding ILOCK over filldir callbacks") we can remove it and
change freeze_super() and thaw_super() to run with s_writers.rw_sem locks
held; we add two trivial helpers for that, lockdep_sb_freeze_release()
and lockdep_sb_freeze_acquire().

xfstests-dev/check `grep -il freeze tests/*/???` does not trigger any
warning from lockdep.
