[media] vivid: return -ENODATA if the current input doesn't support g/s_selection

Returning -EINVAL indicates wrong arguments, but that's not the case
here.

Returning -ENOTTY is also no option, since the ioctl is implemented, but
it just is not valid for this input.

So use -ENODATA instead. This is also used elsewhere when an ioctl isn't
valid for a specific input.

In this case G/S_SELECTION returned -EINVAL for the webcam input. That
input doesn't support cropping, instead it uses ENUM_FRAMESIZES to
enumerate a list of discrete frame sizes.
