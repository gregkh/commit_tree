net/ip_tunnels: Introduce tunnel_id_to_key32() and key32_to_tunnel_id()

Add utility functions to convert a 32 bits key into a 64 bits tunnel and
vice versa.
These functions will be used instead of cloning code in GRE and VXLAN,
and in tc act_iptunnel which will be introduced in a following patch in
this patchset.
