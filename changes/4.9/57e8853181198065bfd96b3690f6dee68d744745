drm/i915: Use VMA for ringbuffer tracking

Use the GGTT VMA as the primary cookie for handing ring objects as
the most common action upon the ring is mapping and unmapping which act
upon the VMA itself. By restructuring the code to work with the ring
VMA, we can shrink the code and remove a few cycles from context pinning.

v2: Move the flush of the object back to before the first pin. We use
the am-I-bound? query to only have to check the flush on the first
bind and so avoid stalling on active rings.
Lots of little renames and small hoops.
