perf report/top: Add a tip about source line numbers with overhead

There is a existing tip as below.

    If you have debuginfo enabled, try: perf report -s sym,srcline

However this tip only describe a condition to use --sort sym,scrline
options.  So there is lack of explanation in the tip. I think that it
would be better to add a tip that exactly explains the feature of --sort
srcline.
