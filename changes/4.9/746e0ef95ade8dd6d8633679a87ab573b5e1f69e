greybus: use null pointer for empty payload

Currently message->payload always points to the address immediately
following the header in a message.  If the payload length is 0, this
is not a valid pointer.

Change the code to assign a null pointer to the payload in this
case.  I have verified that no code dereferences the payload pointer
unless the payload is known to have non-zero size.
