staging: lustre: llite: remove assert for acl refcount

The purpose of this asssert to was to ensure lustre
was properly managing its posix_acl access. This test
is invalid due to the VFS layer also taking references
on the posix_acl. In reality their is no simple way to
detect this class of mistakes.
