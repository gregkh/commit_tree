greybus: Remove "-gb" suffix from .c files

Some files are prefixed with "gb-" and some are suffixed with "-gb". The
rationale behind the first one is that the modules would be named so, i.e.
gb-*.ko. But there is no reason to keep the "-gb" suffix in the second case.

Remove the unnecessary suffix.
