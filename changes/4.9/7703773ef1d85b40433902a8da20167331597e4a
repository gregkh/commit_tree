brcmfmac: fix pmksa->bssid usage

The struct cfg80211_pmksa defines its bssid field as:

    const u8 *bssid;

contrary to struct brcmf_pmksa, which uses:

    u8 bssid[ETH_ALEN];

Therefore in brcmf_cfg80211_del_pmksa(), &pmksa->bssid takes the address
of this field (of type u8**), not the one of its content (which would be
u8*).  Remove the & operator to make brcmf_dbg("%pM") and memcmp()
behave as expected.

This bug have been found using a custom static checker (which checks the
usage of %p... attributes at build time).  It has been introduced in
commit 6c404f34f2bd ("brcmfmac: Cleanup pmksa cache handling code"),
which replaced pmksa->bssid by &pmksa->bssid while refactoring the code,
without modifying struct cfg80211_pmksa definition.

Replace &pmk[i].bssid with pmk[i].bssid too to make the code clearer,
this change does not affect the semantic.
