parisc: Fix race in pci-dma.c

We are still troubled by occasional random segmentation faults and
memory memory corruption on SMP machines.  The causes quite a few
package builds to fail on the Debian buildd machines for parisc.  When
gcc-6 failed to build three times in a row, I looked again at the TLB
related code.  I found a couple of issues.  This is the first.

In general, we need to ensure page table updates and corresponding TLB
purges are atomic.  The attached patch fixes an instance in pci-dma.c
where the page table update was not guarded by the TLB lock.

Tested on rp3440 and c8000.  So far, no further random segmentation
faults have been observed.
