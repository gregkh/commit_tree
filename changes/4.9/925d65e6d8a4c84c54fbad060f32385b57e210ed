net: ethernet: ti: davinci_cpdma: move cpdma channel struct macroses to internals

Keep the driver internals in C file. Currently it's not required for
drivers to know rx or tx a channel is, except create function.
So correct "channel create" function, and use all channel struct
macroses only for internal use.
