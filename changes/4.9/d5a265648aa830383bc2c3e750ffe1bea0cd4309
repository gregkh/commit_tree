greybus: interface: clear upper 16-bits of version_id and product_id

Current userspace looks through the sysfs interface entries for
matching vendor_id and product_id any time an interface is opened
by module developers.  The upper 16-bits of ES3 vendor_id and
product_id contain a reverse mask of the lower 16-bits.  This
additional information is never used and should be removed so
that every consumer of these sysfs entries doesn't have to perform
the same bit clearing logic.
