selinux: Pass security pointer to determine_inode_label()

Right now selinux_determine_inode_label() works on security pointer of
current task. Soon I need this to work on a security pointer retrieved
from a set of creds. So start passing in a pointer and caller can
decide where to fetch security pointer from.
