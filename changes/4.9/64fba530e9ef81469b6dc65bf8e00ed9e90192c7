tpm/tpm_crb: fix the over 80 characters checkpatch warring

Because of the line break in the debug print the chackpatch is
not silent on 80 characters limitation.

The easiest fix is to straighten the lines, it's also more readable.

WARNING: line over 80 characters
+                       FW_BUG "TPM2 ACPI table does not define a memory
resource\n");
