k3dma: Fix "nobody cared" message seen on any error

As it was before, as soon as the DMAC IP felt there was an error
he would return IRQ_NONE since no actual transfer had completed.

After spinning on that for 100K interrupts, Linux yanks the IRQ with
a "nobody cared" error.

This patch lets it handle the interrupt and keep the IRQ alive.
