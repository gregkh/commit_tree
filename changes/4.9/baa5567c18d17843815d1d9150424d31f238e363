arm64: kernel: numa: fix ACPI boot cpu numa node mapping

Commit 7ba5f605f3a0 ("arm64/numa: remove the limitation that cpu0 must
bind to node0") removed the numa cpu<->node mapping restriction whereby
logical cpu 0 always corresponds to numa node 0; removing the
restriction was correct, in that it does not really exist in practice
but the commit only updated the early mapping of logical cpu 0 to its
real numa node for the DT boot path, missing the ACPI one, leading to
boot failures on ACPI systems owing to missing node<->cpu map for
logical cpu 0.

Fix the issue by updating the ACPI boot path with code that carries out
the early cpu<->node mapping also for the boot cpu (ie cpu 0), mirroring
what is currently done in the DT boot path.
