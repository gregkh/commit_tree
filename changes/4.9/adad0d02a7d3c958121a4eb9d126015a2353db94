kvm: svm: fix unsigned compare less than zero comparison

vm_data->avic_vm_id is a u32, so the check for a error
return (less than zero) such as -EAGAIN from
avic_get_next_vm_id currently has no effect whatsoever.
Fix this by using a temporary int for the comparison
and assign vm_data->avic_vm_id to this. I used an explicit
u32 cast in the assignment to show why vm_data->avic_vm_id
cannot be used in the assign/compare steps.
