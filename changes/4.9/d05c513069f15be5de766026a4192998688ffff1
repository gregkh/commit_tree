MIPS: tracing: disable uprobe/kprobe on compact branch instructions

Current instruction decoder for uprobe/kprobe handler only handles
branches with delay slots. For compact branches the behaviour is rather
unpredictable - and depending on the encoding of a compact branch
instruction may result in one (or more) of:
- executing an instruction that follows a branch which wasn't in a delay
  slot and shouldn't have been executed
- incorrectly emulating a branch leading to a jump to a wrong location
- unexpected branching out of the single-stepped code and never reaching
  the breakpoint that should terminate the probe handler

Results of these actions are generally unpredictable, but can end up
with a probed application or kernel crash, so disable placing probes on
compact branches until they are handled properly.
