perf hist: Initialize hierarchy tree explicitly

The hroot_in and hroot_out are roots of hierarchy trees of hist entries.

But when a hist entry is initialized by copying existing template entry,
it sometimes has non-empty tree and copies it incorrectly.  This is a
problem especially when an event group is used since it creates dummy
entries from already-processed entries in other event members.
