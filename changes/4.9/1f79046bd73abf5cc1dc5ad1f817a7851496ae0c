greybus: tracing: fix hd traces

Currently there are two trace points defined for the Greybus host
device structure.  One records information when a message gets sent,
and another when it gets received.  Neither of these is really a
host device event.

We have trace points defined for messages that dump information
about all sent and received messages.  As a result, the information
about sending messages over a host is redundant, and can go away.
(Note that the message traces may need a little refinement so they
produce all desired information.)

Instead of these trace points, define some that are directly
related to the host device abstraction: when one is created,
added, deleted, or released (destroyed).  These do not require
a CPort ID or payload size, so eliminate those two parameters
from the host device trace point prototype.  Change the trace
information recorded for a host device to be just a subset of
interesting fields in a host device.
