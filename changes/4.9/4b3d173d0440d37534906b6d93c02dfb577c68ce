KVM: PPC: Always select KVM_VFIO, plus Makefile cleanup

As discussed recently on the kvm mailing list, David Gibson's
intention in commit 178a78750212 ("vfio: Enable VFIO device for
powerpc", 2016-02-01) was to have the KVM VFIO device built in
on all powerpc platforms.  This patch adds the "select KVM_VFIO"
statement that makes this happen.

Currently, arch/powerpc/kvm/Makefile doesn't include vfio.o for
the 64-bit kvm module, because the list of objects doesn't use
the $(common-objs-y) list.  The reason it doesn't is because we
don't necessarily want coalesced_mmio.o or emulate.o (for example
if HV KVM is the only target), and common-objs-y includes both.

Since this is confusing, this patch adjusts the definitions so that
we now use $(common-objs-y) in the list for the 64-bit kvm.ko
module, emulate.o is removed from common-objs-y and added in the
places that need it, and the inclusion of coalesced_mmio.o now
depends on CONFIG_KVM_MMIO.
