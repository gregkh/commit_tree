cpufreq: intel_pstate: Proportional algorithm for Atom

The PID algorithm used by the intel_pstate driver tends to drive
performance to the minimum for workloads with utilization below the
setpoint, which is undesirable, so replace it with a modified
"proportional" algorithm on Atom.

The new algorithm will set the new P-state to be 1.25 times the
available maximum times the (frequency-invariant) utilization during
the previous sampling period except when the target P-state computed
this way is lower than the average P-state during the previous
sampling period.  In the latter case, it will increase the target by
50% of the difference between it and the average P-state to prevent
performance from dropping down too fast in some cases.
