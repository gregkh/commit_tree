PCI: spear: Make explicitly non-modular

This code is not being built as a module by anyone:

  drivers/pci/host/Kconfig:config PCIE_SPEAR13XX
  drivers/pci/host/Kconfig:  bool "STMicroelectronics SPEAr PCIe controller"

Remove uses of MODULE_DESCRIPTION(), MODULE_AUTHOR(), MODULE_LICENSE(),
etc., so that when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.
The information is preserved in comments at the top of the file.

Note that for non-modular code, MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op and
module_init() translates to device_initcall().
