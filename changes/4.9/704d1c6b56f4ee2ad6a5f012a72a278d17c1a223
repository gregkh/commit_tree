brcmfmac: rework pointer trickery in brcmf_proto_bcdc_query_dcmd()

The variable info is assigned to point to bcdc->msg[1], which is the
same as pointing to bcdc->buf. As that is what we want to access
make it clear by fixing the assignment. This also avoid out-of-bounds
errors from static analyzers are bcdc->msg[1] is not in the structure
definition.
