netns: revert "netns: avoid disabling irq for netns id"

This reverts commit bc51dddf98c9 ("netns: avoid disabling irq for
netns id") as it was found to cause problems with systems running
SELinux/audit, see the mailing list thread below:

 * http://marc.info/?t=147694653900002&r=1&w=2

Eventually we should be able to reintroduce this code once we have
rewritten the audit multicast code to queue messages much the same
way we do for unicast messages.  A tracking issue for this can be
found below:
