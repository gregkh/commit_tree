tipc: eliminate obsolete socket locking policy description

The comment block in socket.c describing the locking policy is
obsolete, and does not reflect current reality. We remove it in this
commit.

Since the current locking policy is much simpler and follows a
mainstream approach, we see no need to add a new description.
