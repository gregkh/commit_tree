docs: sphinx-extensions: add metadata parallel-safe

The setup() function of a Sphinx-extension can return a dictionary. This
is treated by Sphinx as metadata of the extension [1].

With metadata "parallel_read_safe = True" a extension is marked as
save for "parallel reading of source". This is needed if you want
build in parallel with N processes. E.g.:

  make SPHINXOPTS=-j4 htmldocs

will no longer log warnings like:

  WARNING: the foobar extension does not declare if it is safe for
  parallel reading, assuming it isn't - please ask the extension author
  to check and make it explicit.

Add metadata to extensions:

* kernel-doc
* flat-table
* kernel-include
