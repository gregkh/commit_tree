serial: stm32: mark symbols static where possible

We get 2 warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/tty/serial/stm32-usart.c:63:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'stm32_pending_rx' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/tty/serial/stm32-usart.c:88:15: warning: no previous prototype for 'stm32_get_char' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, these two functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.

So this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
