Input: i8042 - skip selftest on ASUS laptops

On suspend/resume cycle, selftest is executed to reset i8042 controller.
But when this is done in Asus devices, subsequent calls to detect/init
functions to elantech driver fails. Skipping selftest fixes this problem.

An easier step to reproduce this problem is adding i8042.reset=1 as a
kernel parameter. On Asus laptops, it'll make the system to start with the
touchpad already stuck, since psmouse_probe forcibly calls the selftest
function.

This patch was inspired by John Hiesey's change[1], but, since this problem
affects a lot of models of Asus, let's avoid running selftests on them.

All models affected by this problem:
A455LD
K401LB
K501LB
K501LX
R409L
V502LX
X302LA
X450LCP
X450LD
X455LAB
X455LDB
X455LF
Z450LA
