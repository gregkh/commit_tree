greybus: don't use %h and %hh for printing short and char variables

Because the width of our fields is already known, we can use %0Nx (for
hex) to print N bytes and %u (for unsigned decimal), instead of using %h
and %hh, which isn't that readable.

This patch makes following changes:
- s/%hx/%04x
- s/%04hx/%04x
- s/%hhx/%02x
- s/%02hhx/%02x
- s/%hhu/%u
- s/%hu/%u
- s/%x/%02x for u8 value (only at a single place)
