samples/bpf: add perf_event+bpf example

The bpf program is called 50 times a second and does hashmap[kern&user_stackid]++
It's primary purpose to check that key bpf helpers like map lookup, update,
get_stackid, trace_printk and ctx access are all working.
It checks:
- PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES on all cpus
- PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES for current process and inherited perf_events to children
- PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_CLOCK on all cpus
- PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_CLOCK for current process
