[media] adv7180: rcar-vin: change mbus format to UYVY

The media bus format reported by the adv7180 is wrong. Steve Longerbeam
posted a patch which changed the format to UYVY8_2X8 with the commit
message:

  Change the media bus format from YUYV8_2X8 to UYVY8_2X8. Colors
  now look correct when capturing with the i.mx6 backend. The other
  option is to set the SWPC bit in register 0x27 to swap the Cr and Cb
  output samples.

The rcar-vin driver was developed and tested with the adv7180 and
therefor suffers from the same issue, looking for the wrong media bus
format. The two errors corrected each other.

This patch takes Steve's patch and merge it with a fix for rcar-vin
driver. The rcar-vin driver is used used in together with the adv7180
och Koelsch and this ensures it will not break while fixing the adv7180
issue. I checked wit Steve and he was fine with me merging the patches.
