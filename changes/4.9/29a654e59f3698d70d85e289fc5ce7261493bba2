PCI: pciehp: Remove useless pciehp_get_latch_status() calls

Long ago, we updated a "switch_save" field based on the latch status.  But
switch_save was unused, and ed6cbcf2ac70 ("[PATCH] pciehp: miscellaneous
cleanups") removed it.

We no longer use the latch status, so remove calls to
pciehp_get_latch_status().  No functional change intended.
