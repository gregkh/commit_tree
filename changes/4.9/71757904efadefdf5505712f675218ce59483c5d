generic syscalls: kill cruft from removed pkey syscalls

pkey_set() and pkey_get() were syscalls present in older versions
of the protection keys patches.  They were fully excised from the
x86 code, but some cruft was left in the generic syscall code.  The
C++ comments were intended to help to make it more glaring to me to
fix them before actually submitting them.  That technique worked,
but later than I would have liked.

I test-compiled this for arm64.
