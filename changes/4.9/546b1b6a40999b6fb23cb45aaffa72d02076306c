drm/i915: Store the active context object on all engines upon error

With execlists, we have context objects everywhere, not just RCS. So
store them for post-mortem debugging. This also has a secondary effect
of removing one more unsafe list iteration with using preserved state
from the hanging request. And now we can cross-reference the request's
context state with that loaded by the GPU.
