thermal: rockchip: add the set_trips function

Whenever the current temperature is updated, the trip points immediately
below and above the current temperature are found. A sensor driver
callback `set_trips' is then called with the temperatures.
Lastly, The sensor will trigger the hardware high temperature interrupts
to increase the sampleing rate and throttle frequency to limit the
temperature rising When performing passive cooling.
