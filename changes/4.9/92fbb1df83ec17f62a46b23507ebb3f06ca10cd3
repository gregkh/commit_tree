be2net: Avoid unnecessary firmware updates of multicast list

Eachtime the ndo_set_rx_mode() routine is called, the driver programs the
multicast list in the adapter without checking if there are any changes to
the list. This leads to a flood of RX_FILTER cmds when a number of vlan
interfaces are configured over the device, as the ndo_ gets
called for each vlan interface. To avoid this, we now use __dev_mc_sync()
and __dev_uc_sync() API, but only to detect if there is a change in the
mc/uc lists. Now that we use this API, the code has to be-designed to
issue these API calls for each invocation of the be_set_rx_mode() call.
