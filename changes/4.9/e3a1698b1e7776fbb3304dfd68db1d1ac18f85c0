PCI: iproc: Hard-code PCIe capability offset instead of searching

We know where the PCIe capability lives in the host bridge's config space;
in fact, we already hard-coded the offset of the Link Control 2 register.

The hard-coded Link Control 2 offset was 0xdc.  Link Control 2 is at offset
0x30 into the PCIe capability, so the capability itself must be at
0xdc - 0x30 = 0xac.

Hard-code the PCIe capability offset, which means we don't have to search
for it and we can use the standard definitions for registers within the
capability.

No functional change intended.
