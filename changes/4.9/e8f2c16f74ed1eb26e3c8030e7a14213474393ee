ACPICA: Debugger: Fix wrong inclusions in dbfileio.c

ACPICA commit 649eb441fbef21965d10a1aca6ff41dcf23f8e05

dbfileio.c implements debugger functionalities that can only be used by the
application layer debugger (acpiexec), thus it should always include
<acapps.h> and thus shouldn't include <stdio.h> separately. Lv Zheng.
