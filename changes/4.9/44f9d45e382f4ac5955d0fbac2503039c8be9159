Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt: convert it to ReST markup

Add markups for it to be properly parsed by Sphinx.

As people browsing this document may not notice that the source
file title is "stable_api_nonsense", I opted to use bold to
the rationale for this document. I also found it better to
add a note when it says that the nonsense applies only to the
kABI/kAPI, and not to uAPI.
