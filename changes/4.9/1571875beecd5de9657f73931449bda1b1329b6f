ACPI / platform: Add support for build-in properties

We have a couple of drivers, acpi_apd.c and acpi_lpss.c,
that need to pass extra build-in properties to the devices
they create. Previously the drivers added those properties
to the struct device which is member of the struct
acpi_device, but that does not work. Those properties need
to be assigned to the struct device of the platform device
instead in order for them to become available to the
drivers.

To fix this, this patch changes acpi_create_platform_device
function to take struct property_entry pointer as parameter.
