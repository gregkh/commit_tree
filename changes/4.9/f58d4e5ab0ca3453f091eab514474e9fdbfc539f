PM / Domains: Don't expose generic_pm_domain structure to clients

There should be no need to expose the generic_pm_domain structure to
clients and this eliminates the need to implement reference counting for
any external reference to a PM domain. Therefore, make the functions
pm_genpd_lookup_dev() and of_genpd_get_from_provider() private to the
PM domain core. The functions are renamed in accordance with the naming
conventions for genpd static functions.
