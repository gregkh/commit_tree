netfilter: xt_TCPMSS: Refactor the codes to decrease one condition check and more readable

The origin codes perform two condition checks with dst_mtu(skb_dst(skb))
and in_mtu. And the last statement is "min(dst_mtu(skb_dst(skb)),
in_mtu) - minlen". It may let reader think about how about the result.
Would it be negative.

Now assign the result of min(dst_mtu(skb_dst(skb)), in_mtu) to a new
variable, then only perform one condition check, and it is more readable.
