arm64: defconfig: enable common modules for power management

Enable common modules for power management; one is to enable
CPUFREQ_DT driver; the driver is used by many platforms by passing OPP
table from device tree.

Also enables thermal related drivers. Firstly we need enable
configuration CPU_THERMAL for CPU cooling device driver, this will bind
thermal zone with CPU cooling device; and enable 'power allocator'
thermal governor.
