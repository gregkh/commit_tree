drm/i915: Combine loops within i915_gem_evict_something

Slight micro-optimise to produce combine loops so that gcc is able to
optimise the inner-loops concisely. Since we are reviewing the loops, we
can update the comments to describe the current state of affairs, in
particular the distinction between evicting from the global GTT (which
may contain untracked items and transient global pins) and the
per-process GTT.
