serial: imx-serial - update UART IMX driver to use cyclic DMA

The IMX UART has a 32 bytes HW buffer which can be filled up in
2777us at 115200 baud or 80us at 4Mbaud (supported by IMX53).
Taking this in consideration there is a good probability to lose
data because of the DMA startup latency.
Our tests (explained below) indicates a latency up to 4400us when
creating interrupt load and ~70us without. When creating interrupt
load I was able to see continuous overrun errors by checking serial
driver statistics using the command:
`cat /proc/tty/driver/IMX-uart`.

Replace manual restart of DMA with cyclic DMA to eliminate data loss
due to DMA engine startup latency (similar approch to atmel_serial.c
driver). As result the DMA engine will start on the first serial data
transfer and stops only when serial port is closed.

Tests environment:
 Using the m53evk board I have used a GPIO for profiling the IMX
 serial driver.
  - The RX line and GPIO were connected to oscilloscope.
  - Run a small test program on the m53evk board that will only open
    and read data from ttymxc2 port.
  - Connect the ttymxc2 port to my laptop using a USB serial converter
    where another test program is running, able to send configurable
    packet lengths and intervals.
  - Serial ports configured at 115200 8N1.
  - Interrupts load created by disconnecting/connecting (3s interval)
    a USB hub, using a digital switch, with 4 USB devices (USB-Serial
    converter, USB SD card, etc) connected.
    (around 160 interrupts/second generated)
  - The GPIO was toggled HI in the `imx_int` when USR1_RRDY or USR1_AGTIM
    events are received and toggled back, once the DMA configuration
    is finalized, at the end of `imx_dma_rxint`.

Measurements:
The measurements were done from the end of the last byte (RX line) until
the GPIO was toggled back LOW.

Note: The GPIO toggling was done using `gpiod_set_value` method.

Tests performed:
   1. Sending 9 bytes packets at 8ms interval. Having the 9 bytes packets
      will activate the RRDY threshold event and IMX serial interrupt
      called.
      Results:
        - DMA start latency (interrupt start latency +
           DMA configuration) consistently 70us when system not loaded.
        - DMA start latency up to 4400us when system loaded.
   2. Sending 40 bytes packet at 8mS interval.
      Results with load:
        - Able to observe overruns by running:
           `watch -n1 cat /proc/tty/driver/IMX-uart`
