greybus: connection: Call connection_destroy() from gb_connection_svc_connection_destroy()

connection_create() is called right after svc is requested to create the
connection and so connection_destroy() must be called just before we
request the SVC to destroy the connection.

Over that, this fixes the inconsistency where connection_create() is
called for all connections except SVC connection, but
connection_destroy() is called always.
