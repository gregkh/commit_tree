batman-adv: Introduce forward packet creation helper

This patch abstracts the forward packet creation into the new function
batadv_forw_packet_alloc().

The queue counting and interface reference counters are now handled
internally within batadv_forw_packet_alloc() and its
batadv_forw_packet_free() counterpart. This should reduce the risk of
having reference/queue counting bugs again and should increase
code readibility.
