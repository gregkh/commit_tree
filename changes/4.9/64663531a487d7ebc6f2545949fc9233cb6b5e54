[media] rcar-vin: do not use v4l2_device_call_until_err()

Fix a error from the original driver where v4l2_device_call_until_err()
where used for the pad specific v4l2 operation set_fmt.  Also fix up the
error path from this fix so if there is an error it will be propagated
to the caller.

The error path label have also been renamed as a result from a
nitpicking review comment since we are fixing other issues here.
