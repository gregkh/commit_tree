xfs: defer should abort intent items if the trans roll fails

If the deferred ops transaction roll fails, we need to abort the intent
items if we haven't already logged a done item for it, regardless of
whether or not the deferred ops has had a transaction committed.  Dave
found this while running generic/388.

Move the tracepoint to make it easier to track object lifetimes.
