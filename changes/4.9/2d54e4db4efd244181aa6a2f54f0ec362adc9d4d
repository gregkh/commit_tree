greybus: bundle: kill gb_bundle_bind_protocols

Remove gb_bundle_bind_protocols() that was used to iterate over all
registered bundles and bind protocols to them should a protocol become
available post bundle creation.

The protocol abstraction as a generic construct is going away in favour
of class drivers. Connections will be setup when a class driver is
probed, and driver modules can be loaded on-demand by user space based
on uevents and modalias.
