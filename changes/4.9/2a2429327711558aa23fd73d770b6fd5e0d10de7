HID: sony: Defer the initial USB Sixaxis output report

When initially connected via USB the Sixaxis isn't fully initialized
until the PS logo button is pressed and won't send any input reports
nor will any state set by output reports be retained.

This adds a 'defer_initialization' flag to the sony_sc struct which,
when set, will delay sending any output reports until the first input
report has arrived. This flag is used with the USB Sixaxis to ensure
that any state sent will persist since, until the PS button is pushed,
any changes sent to the controller via an output report will be lost
after a couple of seconds.

The initial state of the controller is still configured at the time
of the initial connection and won't be internally modified after that,
so any state set by the user between that time and the recepit of the
first input report won't be lost.
