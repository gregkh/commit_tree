EDAC, fsl_ddr: Add missing DDR DRAM types

The compatible DDR controllers may support DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 DRAM.
An individual controller doesn't support all of them. The EDAC driver
reads SDRAM_CFG to determine which mode is configured.

Add DDR4 and drop the defines used only in the mtype assignment.
