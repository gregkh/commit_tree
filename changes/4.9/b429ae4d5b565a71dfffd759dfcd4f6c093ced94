sparc64: Fix illegal relative branches in hypervisor patched TLB code.

When we copy code over to patch another piece of code, we can only use
PC-relative branches that target code within that piece of code.

Such PC-relative branches cannot be made to external symbols because
the patch moves the location of the code and thus modifies the
relative address of external symbols.

Use an absolute jmpl to fix this problem.
