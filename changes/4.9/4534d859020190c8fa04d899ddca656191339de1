IB/sa : Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

alloc_ordered_workqueue() with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, replaces
deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue(). This is the identity
conversion.

The workqueue "ib_nl" queues work item &ib_nl_timed_work. It has been
identity converted.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under memory
pressure.
