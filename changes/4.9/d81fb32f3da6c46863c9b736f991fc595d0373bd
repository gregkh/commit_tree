remoteproc: Move vdev handling to boot/shutdown

The newly introduced "always-on" flag allows us to stop giving the vdevs
special treatment. The ordering of resource allocation and life cycle of
the remote processor is kept intact.

This allows us to mark a remote processor with vdevs to not boot unless
explicitly requested to do so by a client driver.
