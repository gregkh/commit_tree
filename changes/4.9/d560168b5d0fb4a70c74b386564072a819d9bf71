hwmon: (core) New hwmon registration API

Up to now, each hwmon driver has to implement its own sysfs attributes.
This requires a lot of template code, and distracts from the driver's core
function to read and write chip registers.

To be able to reduce driver complexity, move sensor attribute handling
and thermal zone registration into hwmon core. By using the new API,
driver code and data size is typically reduced by 20-70%, depending
on driver complexity and the number of sysfs attributes supported.

With this patch, the new API only supports thermal sensors. Support for
other sensor types will be added with subsequent patches.
