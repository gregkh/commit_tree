greybus: tracing: reorder trace definitions

Move the definition of the module trace events below those for the
interface.  We'll define them in an order that represents a sort of
layering of the abstractions (note not all of these are defined yet):
    message
    operation
    connection
    bundle
    interface
    module
    host device
Other tracepoints (like perhaps some tied to timesync) will go at the
beginning or end.
