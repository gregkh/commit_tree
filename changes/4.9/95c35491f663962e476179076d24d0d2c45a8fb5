PCI/AER: Remove duplicate AER severity translation

Currently the AER severity is being translated twice in the code flow for
PCIe errors.  It is first translated in ghes_do_proc() before calling into
the AER driver.  Then it is translated again when the AER driver calls
cper_print_aer().  This causes the severity that is used in
cper_print_aer() to be incorrect.

Remove the second translation that is in cper_print_aer() since this
function is already receiving the correct AER severity.
