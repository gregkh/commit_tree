iommu/arm-smmu: Streamline SMMU data lookups

Simplify things somewhat by stashing our arm_smmu_device instance in
drvdata, so that it's readily available to our driver model callbacks.
Then we can excise the private list entirely, since the driver core
already has a perfectly good list of SMMU devices we can use in the one
instance we actually need to. Finally, make a further modest code saving
with the relatively new of_device_get_match_data() helper.
