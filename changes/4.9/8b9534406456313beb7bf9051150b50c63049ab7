KVM: x86: do not go through vcpu in __get_kvmclock_ns

Going through the first VCPU is wrong if you follow a KVM_SET_CLOCK with
a KVM_GET_CLOCK immediately after, without letting the VCPU run and
call kvm_guest_time_update.

To fix this, compute the kvmclock value ourselves, using the master
clock (tsc, nsec) pair as the base and the host CPU frequency as
the scale.
