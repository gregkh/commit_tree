drm/i915: Reduce amount of duplicate buffer information captured on error

When capturing the error state, we do not need to know about every
address space - just those that are related to the error. We know which
context is active at the time, therefore we know which VM are implicated
in the error. We can then restrict the VM which we report to the
relevant subset.

v2: s/i/count_active/ (and similar)
    Rewrite label generation for "Buffers"
