UBI: Fix crash in try_recover_peb()

    drivers/mtd/ubi/eba.c: In function ‘try_recover_peb’:
    drivers/mtd/ubi/eba.c:744: warning: ‘vid_hdr’ is used uninitialized in this function

The pointer vid_hdr is indeed not initialized, leading to a crash when
it is dereferenced.

Fix this by obtaining the pointer from the VID buffer, like is done
everywhere else.
