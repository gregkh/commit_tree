[media] doc-rst: Correct the ordering of LSBs of the 10-bit raw packed formats

The 10-bit packed raw bayer format documented that the data of the first
pixel of a four-pixel group was found in the first byte and the two
highest bits of the fifth byte. This was not entirely correct. The two
bits in the fifth byte are the two lowest bits. The second pixel occupies
the second byte and third and fourth least significant bits and so on.
