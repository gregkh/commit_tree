greybus: camera: Update Configure Streams Response

As camera specification gets updated, and Configure Stream Response
payload modified, define here the new response structure.
In order to not break non up-to-date camera modules, keep the existing
structure and add the _deprecated suffix to it.

Add the size of both new and old structure in order to discriminate
dynamically which version of Camera Specification the camera module
implements and translate deprecated version of configure_streams response
in the new one.

In order not to break camera functionalities, for testing purposes,
hard-code values the APB-A CSI Tx driver still requires for proper
interface configuration (lines_per_second and num_lanes)

Testing Done: Preview, capture and video recording with white camera
module and APB-A with legacy firmware implementations
