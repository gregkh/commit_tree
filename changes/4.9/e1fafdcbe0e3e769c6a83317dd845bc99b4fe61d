IB/rdmavt: rdmavt can handle non aligned page maps

The initial code for rdmavt carried with it a restriction that was a
vestige from the qib driver, that to dma map a page it had to be less
than a page size. This is not the case on modern hardware, both qib and
hfi1 will be just fine with unaligned map requests.

This fixes a 4.8 regression where by an IPoIB transfer of > PAGE_SIZE
will hang because the dma map page call always fails. This was
introduced after commit 5faba5469522 ("IB/ipoib: Report SG feature
regardless of HW UD CSUM capability") added the capability to use SG by
default. Rather than override this, the HW supports it, so allow SG.
