ALSA: hda - Fix mic regression by ASRock mobo fixup

The commit [1a3f099101b8: ALSA: hda - Fix surround output pins for
ASRock B150M mobo] introduced a fixup of pin configs for ASRock
mobos to fix the surround outputs.  However, this overrides the pin
configs of the mic pins as if they are outputs-only, effectively
disabling the mic inputs.  Of course, it's a regression wrt mic
functionality.

Actually the pins 0x18 and 0x1a don't need to be changed; we just need
to disable the bogus pins 0x14 and 0x15.  Then the auto-parser will
pick up mic pins as switchable and assign the surround outputs there.

This patch removes the incorrect pin overrides of NID 0x18 and 0x1a
from the ASRock fixup.
