drm/i915/cmdparser: Improve hash function

The existing code's hashfunction is very suboptimal (most 3D commands
use the same bucket degrading the hash to a long list). The code even
acknowledge that the issue was known and the fix simple:

/*
 * If we attempt to generate a perfect hash, we should be able to look at bits
 * 31:29 of a command from a batch buffer and use the full mask for that
 * client. The existing INSTR_CLIENT_MASK/SHIFT defines can be used for this.
