dma-buf/sync-file: Avoid enable fence signaling if poll(.timeout=0)

If we being polled with a timeout of zero, a nonblocking busy query,
we don't need to install any fence callbacks as we will not be waiting.
As we only install the callback once, the overhead comes from the atomic
bit test that also causes serialisation between threads.
