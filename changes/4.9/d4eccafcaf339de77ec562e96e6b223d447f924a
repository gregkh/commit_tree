xtensa: clean up printk usage for boot/crash logging

Convert printk(KERN_* to pr_* and printk's without level to pr_cont.
This fixes torn register dumps, stack dumps, stack traces and timestamps
in the middle of 'Calibrating CPU frequency' message.
Also drop unused show_code and drop false comment about show_stack.
