rcu: Stop disabling expedited RCU CPU stall warnings

Now that RCU expedited grace periods are always driven by a workqueue,
there is no need to account for signal reception, and thus no need
to disable expedited RCU CPU stall warnings due to signal reception.
This commit therefore removes the signal-reception checks, leaving a
WARN_ON() to catch possible future bugs.
