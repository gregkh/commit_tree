arm64/kvm: use {read,write}_sysreg()

A while back we added {read,write}_sysreg accessors to handle accesses
to system registers, without the usual boilerplate asm volatile,
temporary variable, etc.

This patch makes use of these in the arm64 KVM code to make the code
shorter and clearer.

At the same time, a comment style violation next to a system register
access is fixed up in reset_pmcr, and comments describing whether
operations are reads or writes are removed as this is now painfully
obvious.
