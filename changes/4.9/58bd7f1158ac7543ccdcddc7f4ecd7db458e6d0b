mac80211: fix scan completed tracing

Passing the 'info' pointer where a 'info->aborted' is expected will
always lead to tracing to erroneously record that the scan was aborted,
fix that by passing the correct info->aborted. The remaining data will
be collected in cfg80211, so I haven't duplicated it here.
