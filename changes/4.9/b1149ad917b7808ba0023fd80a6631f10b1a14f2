coresight: always use stashed trace id value in etm4_trace_id

etm4_trace_id is not guaranteed to be executed on the CPU whose ETM is
being accessed. This leads to exception similar to below one if the
CPU whose ETM is being accessed is in deeper idle states. So it must
be executed on the CPU whose ETM is being accessed.

However, TRCTRACEIDR is not guaranteed to hold the previous programmed
trace id if it enters deeper idle states. Further, the trace id that is
computed in etm4_init_trace_id is programmed into TRCTRACEIDR only in
etm4_enable_hw which happens much later in the sequence after
coresight_id_match is executed from enable_source_store.

This patch simplifies etm4_trace_id by returning the stashed trace id
value similar to etm4_cpu_id.
