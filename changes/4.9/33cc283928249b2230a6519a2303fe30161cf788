greybus: audio: Report jack removal along with module removal

For GB module with jack slot supported, headset/headphone can still
be inserted at the time of module removal. In this case, above layer is
unaware about jack removal event which happened due to module removal.
This may lead to inconsistent state in above HAL layer.  Fix this by
reporting jack removal event explicitly.
