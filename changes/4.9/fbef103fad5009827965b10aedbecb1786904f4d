perf tools: Do hugetlb handling in more systems

The csets:

  0ac3348e5024 ("perf tools: Recognize hugetlb mapping as anon mapping")
  d7e404af115b ("perf record: Mark MAP_HUGETLB when synthesizing mmap events")

Added code conditional on MAP_HUGETLB, to make it build in older systems
where that define wasn't available. Now that we grabbed copies of
uapi/linux/mmap.h to have all those definitions in tools/, use it so
that we can support building the tools for older systems (without the
MAP_HUGETLB define in its libc headers) using new kernels that support
such maps.
