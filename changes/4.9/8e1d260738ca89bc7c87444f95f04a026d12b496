Drivers: hv: utils: Support TimeSync version 4.0 protocol samples.

This enables support for more accurate TimeSync v4 samples when hosted
under Windows Server 2016 and newer hosts.

The new time samples include a "vmreferencetime" field that represents
the guest's TSC value when the host generated its time sample. This value
lets the guest calculate the latency in receiving the time sample. The
latency is added to the sample host time prior to updating the clock.
