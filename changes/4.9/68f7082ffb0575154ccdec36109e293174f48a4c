perf/x86: Ensure perf_sched_cb_{inc,dec}() is only called from pmu::{add,del}()

Currently perf_sched_cb_{inc,dec}() are called from
pmu::{start,stop}(), which has the problem that this can happen from
NMI context, this is making it hard to optimize perf_pmu_sched_task().

Furthermore, we really only need this accounting on pmu::{add,del}(),
so doing it from pmu::{start,stop}() is doing more work than we really
need.

Introduce x86_pmu::{add,del}() and wire up the LBR and PEBS.
