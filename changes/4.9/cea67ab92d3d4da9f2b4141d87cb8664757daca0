btrfs: clean the old superblocks before freeing the device

btrfs_rm_device frees the block device but then re-opens it using
the saved device name.  A race exists between the close and the
re-open that allows the block size to be changed.  The result
is getting stuck forever in the reclaim loop in __getblk_slow.

This patch moves the superblock cleanup before closing the block
device, which is also consistent with other callers.  We also don't
need a private copy of dev_name as the whole routine operates under
the uuid_mutex.
