perf intel-pt: Fix estimated timestamps for cycle-accurate mode

In cycle-accurate mode, timestamps can be calculated from CYC packets.
The decoder also estimates timestamps based on the number of
instructions since the last timestamp. For that to work in
cycle-accurate mode, the instruction count needs to be reset to zero
when a timestamp is calculated from a CYC packet, but that wasn't
happening, so fix it.
