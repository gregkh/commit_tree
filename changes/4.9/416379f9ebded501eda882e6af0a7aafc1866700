PCI: designware: Check for iATU unroll support after initializing host

dw_pcie_iatu_unroll_enabled() reads a dbi_base register.  Reading any
dbi_base register before pp->ops->host_init has been called causes
"imprecise external abort" on platforms like ARTPEC-6, where the PCIe
module is disabled at boot and first enabled in pp->ops->host_init.  Move
dw_pcie_iatu_unroll_enabled() to dw_pcie_setup_rc(), since it is after
pp->ops->host_init, but before pp->iatu_unroll_enabled is actually used.
