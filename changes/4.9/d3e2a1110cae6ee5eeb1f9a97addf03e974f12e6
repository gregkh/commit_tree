netfilter: nf_tables: fix inconsistent element expiration calculation

As Liping Zhang reports, after commit a8b1e36d0d1d ("netfilter: nft_dynset:
fix element timeout for HZ != 1000"), priv->timeout was stored in jiffies,
while set->timeout was stored in milliseconds. This is inconsistent and
incorrect.

Firstly, we already call msecs_to_jiffies in nft_set_elem_init, so
priv->timeout will be converted to jiffies twice.

Secondly, if the user did not specify the NFTA_DYNSET_TIMEOUT attr,
set->timeout will be used, but we forget to call msecs_to_jiffies
when do update elements.

Fix this by using jiffies internally for traditional sets and doing the
conversions to/from msec when interacting with userspace - as dynset
already does.

This is preferable to doing the conversions, when elements are inserted or
updated, because this can happen very frequently on busy dynsets.
