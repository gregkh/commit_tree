s390/crypto: cpacf function detection

The CPACF code makes some assumptions about the availablity of hardware
support. E.g. if the machine supports KM(AES-256) without chaining it is
assumed that KMC(AES-256) with chaining is available as well. For the
existing CPUs this is true but the architecturally correct way is to
check each CPACF functions on its own. This is what the query function
of each instructions is all about.
