kthread: better support freezable kthread workers

This patch allows to make kthread worker freezable via a new @flags
parameter. It will allow to avoid an init work in some kthreads.

It currently does not affect the function of kthread_worker_fn()
but it might help to do some optimization or fixes eventually.

I currently do not know about any other use for the @flags
parameter but I believe that we will want more flags
in the future.

Finally, I hope that it will not cause confusion with @flags member
in struct kthread. Well, I guess that we will want to rework the
basic kthreads implementation once all kthreads are converted into
kthread workers or workqueues. It is possible that we will merge
the two structures.
