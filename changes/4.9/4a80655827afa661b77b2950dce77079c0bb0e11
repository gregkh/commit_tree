drm/i915: Pass atomic state to crtc enable/disable functions

This is required for supporting nonblocking modesets. Iterating over
the connector list will no longer be allowed when we don't hold
connection_mutex, so we have to use the atomic state.

Fix disable_noatomic by populating the minimal state required to
disable a connector.
