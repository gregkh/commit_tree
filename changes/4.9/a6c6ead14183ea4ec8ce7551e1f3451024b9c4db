cpufreq: intel_pstate: Set P-state upfront in performance mode

After commit a4675fbc4a7a (cpufreq: intel_pstate: Replace timers with
utilization update callbacks) the cpufreq governor callbacks may not
be invoked on NOHZ_FULL CPUs and, in particular, switching to the
"performance" policy via sysfs may not have any effect on them.  That
is a problem, because it usually is desirable to squeeze the last
bit of performance out of those CPUs, so work around it by setting
the maximum P-state (within the limits) in intel_pstate_set_policy()
upfront when the policy is CPUFREQ_POLICY_PERFORMANCE.
