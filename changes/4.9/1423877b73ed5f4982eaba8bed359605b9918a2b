spi: fsl-espi: pre-allocate message buffer

Currently the driver allocates a 64kb buffer for each single message.
On systems with little and fragmented memory this can result in
memory allocation errors. Solve this by pre-allocating a buffer.

This patch was developed in OpenWRT long ago, however it never
made it upstream.

I slightly modified the original patch to re-initialize the buffer
at the beginning of each transfer.
