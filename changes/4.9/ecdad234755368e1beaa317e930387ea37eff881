net: hisilicon: mark symbols static where possible

We get 2 warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hisi_femac.c:943:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'hisi_femac_drv_suspend' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hisi_femac.c:960:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'hisi_femac_drv_resume' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, these two functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
