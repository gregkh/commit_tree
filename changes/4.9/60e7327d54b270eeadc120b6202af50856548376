greybus: audio: Find data connection based on id

Currently we are using dai->name to identify data connection from list
for a module. Now since we are enabling data path based on widget,
dai->name might be invalid by the time driver receives disable request
for a widget. So, use id fetched from AIF widget->sname to identify data
connection for a module.
