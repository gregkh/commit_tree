rtlwifi: Add HAL_DEF_WOWLAN case to *_get_hw() routines

Only rtl8821ae implements WOWLAN; however, the other drivers may receive
a call requesting information about this mode. The other drivers need to
ignore the request rather than logging that the default branch of the
switch statement has been reached.
