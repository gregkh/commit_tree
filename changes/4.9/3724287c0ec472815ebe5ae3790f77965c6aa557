Drivers: hv: vmbus: Implement a mechanism to tag the channel for low latency

On Hyper-V, performance critical channels use the monitor
mechanism to signal the host when the guest posts mesages
for the host. This mechanism minimizes the hypervisor intercepts
and also makes the host more efficient in that each time the
host is woken up, it processes a batch of messages as opposed to
just one. The goal here is improve the throughput and this is at
the expense of increased latency.
Implement a mechanism to let the client driver decide if latency
is important.
