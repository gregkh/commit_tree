rtlwifi: Fix missing country code for Great Britain

Some RTL8821AE devices sold in Great Britain have the country code of
0x25 encoded in their EEPROM. This value is not tested in the routine
that establishes the regulatory info for the chip. The fix is to set
this code to have the same capabilities as the EU countries. In addition,
the channels allowed for COUNTRY_CODE_ETSI were more properly suited
for China and Israel, not the EU. This problem has also been fixed.
