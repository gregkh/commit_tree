vlan: Check for vlan ethernet types for 8021.q or 802.1ad

This is to simplify using double tagged vlans. This function allows all
valid vlan ethertypes to be checked in a single function call.
Also replace some instances that check for both ETH_P_8021Q and
ETH_P_8021AD.

Patch based on one originally by Thomas F Herbert.
