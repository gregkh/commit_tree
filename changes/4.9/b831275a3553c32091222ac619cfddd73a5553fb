timers: Plug locking race vs. timer migration

Linus noticed that lock_timer_base() lacks a READ_ONCE() for accessing the
timer flags. As a consequence the compiler is allowed to reload the flags
between the initial check for TIMER_MIGRATION and the following timer base
computation and the spin lock of the base.

While this has not been observed (yet), we need to make sure that it never
happens.
