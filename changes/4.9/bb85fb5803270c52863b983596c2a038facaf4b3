powerpc: During context switch, check before setting mm_cpumask

During context switch, switch_mm() sets our current CPU in mm_cpumask.
We can avoid this atomic sequence in most cases by checking before
setting the bit.

Testing on a POWER8 using our context switch microbenchmark:

tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/benchmarks/context_switch \
	--process --no-fp --no-altivec --no-vector

Performance improves 2%.
