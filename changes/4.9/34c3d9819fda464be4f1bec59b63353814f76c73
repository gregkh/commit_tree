genirq/affinity: Provide smarter irq spreading infrastructure

The current irq spreading infrastructure is just looking at a cpumask and
tries to spread the interrupts over the mask. Thats suboptimal as it does
not take numa nodes into account.

Change the logic so the interrupts are spread across numa nodes and inside
the nodes. If there are more cpus than vectors per node, then we set the
affinity to several cpus. If HT siblings are available we take that into
account and try to set all siblings to a single vector.
