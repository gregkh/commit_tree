net/mlx5: E-Switch, Set vport representor fields explicitly on registration

The structure we use for the eswitch vport representor (mlx5_eswitch_rep)
has some fields which are set from upper layers in the driver when they
register the rep. Use explicit setting on registration time for them and
avoid global memcpy. This patch doesn't add new functionality.
