zfcp: retain trace level for SCSI and HBA FSF response records

While retaining the actual filtering according to trace level,
the following commits started to write such filtered records
with a hardcoded record level of 1 instead of the actual record level:
commit 250a1352b95e1db3216e5c5d4f4365bea5122f4a
("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing for SCSI records.")
commit a54ca0f62f953898b05549391ac2a8a4dad6482b
("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing for HBA records.")

Now we can distinguish written records again for offline level filtering.
