mtd: mtk: avoid warning in mtk_ecc_encode

When building with -Wmaybe-uninitialized, gcc produces a silly false positive
warning for the mtk_ecc_encode function:

drivers/mtd/nand/mtk_ecc.c: In function 'mtk_ecc_encode':
drivers/mtd/nand/mtk_ecc.c:402:15: error: 'val' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The function for some reason contains a double byte swap on big-endian
builds to get the OOB data into the correct order again, and is written
in a slightly confusing way.

Using a simple memcpy32_fromio() to read the data simplifies it a lot
so it becomes more readable and produces no warning. However, the
output might not have 32-bit alignment, so we have to use another
memcpy to avoid taking alignment faults or writing beyond the end
of the array.
