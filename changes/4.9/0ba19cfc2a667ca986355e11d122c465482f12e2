gpio: Add Intel WhiskeyCove PMIC GPIO driver

This patch introduces a separate GPIO driver for Intel WhiskeyCove PMIC.
This driver is based on gpio-crystalcove.c.

Changes in v7:
 - Fixed various coding style comments from Andy Shevchenko
Changes in v6:
 - Removed unnecessary wcove_gpio_remove()
 - Used devm_gpiochip_remove() instead of gpiochip_remove()
 - Various coding style changes per Mika's comment
Changes in v5:
 - Revisited the interrupt handler code to iterate until all pending
   interrupts are handled. This change is to avoid missing interrupt
   when we're inside the interrupt handler.
 - Used regmap_bulk_read() to read address adjacent registers.
Changes in v4:
 - Converted CTLI_INTCNT_XX macros to less verbose ones INT_DETECT_XX.
 - Add comments about why there is no .pm for the driver.
 - Header files re-ordered.
 - Various coding style change to address Andy's comments.
Changes in v3:
 - Fixed the year in copyright line(2015-->2016).
 - Removed DRV_NAME macro.
 - Added kernel-doc for regmap_irq_chip of the wcove_gpio structure.
 - Line length fix.
Changes in v2:
 - Typo fix (Whsikey --> Whiskey).
 - Included linux/gpio/driver.h instead of linux/gpio.h
 - Implemented .set_single_ended().
 - Added GPIO register description.
 - Replaced container_of() with gpiochip_get_data().
 - Removed unnecessary "if (gpio > WCOVE_VGPIO_NUM" check.
 - Removed the device id table and added MODULE_ALIAS().
