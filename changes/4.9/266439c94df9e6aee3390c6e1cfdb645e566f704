sunqe: Fix compiler warnings

sunqe uses '__u32' for dma handle while invoking kernel DMA APIs,
instead of using dma_addr_t. This hasn't caused any 'incompatible
pointer type' warning on SPARC because until now dma_addr_t is of
type u32. However, recent changes in SPARC ATU (iommu) enables 64bit
DMA and therefore dma_addr_t becomes of type u64. This makes
'incompatible pointer type' warnings inevitable.

e.g.
drivers/net/ethernet/sun/sunqe.c: In function ‘qec_ether_init’:
drivers/net/ethernet/sun/sunqe.c:883: warning: passing argument 3 of ‘dma_alloc_coherent’ from incompatible pointer type
./include/linux/dma-mapping.h:445: note: expected ‘dma_addr_t *’ but argument is of type ‘__u32 *’
drivers/net/ethernet/sun/sunqe.c:885: warning: passing argument 3 of ‘dma_alloc_coherent’ from incompatible pointer type
./include/linux/dma-mapping.h:445: note: expected ‘dma_addr_t *’ but argument is of type ‘__u32 *’

This patch resolves above compiler warnings.
