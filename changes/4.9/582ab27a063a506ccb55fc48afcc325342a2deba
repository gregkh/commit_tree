mei: bus: fix received data size check in NFC fixup

NFC version reply size checked against only header size, not against
full message size. That may lead potentially to uninitialized memory access
in version data.

That leads to warnings when version data is accessed:
drivers/misc/mei/bus-fixup.c: warning: '*((void *)&ver+11)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]:  => 212:2
