treewide: remove redundant #include <linux/kconfig.h>

Kernel source files need not include <linux/kconfig.h> explicitly
because the top Makefile forces to include it with:

  -include $(srctree)/include/linux/kconfig.h

This commit removes explicit includes except the following:

  * arch/s390/include/asm/facilities_src.h
  * tools/testing/radix-tree/linux/kernel.h

These two are used for host programs.
