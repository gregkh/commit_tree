perf tools: Add jsmn `jasmine' JSON parser

I need a JSON parser. This adds the simplest JSON parser I could find --
Serge Zaitsev's jsmn `jasmine' -- to the perf library. I merely
converted it to (mostly) Linux style and added support for non 0
terminated input.

The parser is quite straight forward and does not copy any data, just
returns tokens with offsets into the input buffer. So it's relatively
efficient and simple to use.

The code is not fully checkpatch clean, but I didn't want to completely
fork the upstream code.

Original source: http://zserge.bitbucket.org/jsmn.html

In addition I added a simple wrapper that mmaps a json file and provides
some straight forward access functions.

Used in follow-on patches to parse event files.

  use stdbool.h to avoid clashing with 'bool' typedef there ]
