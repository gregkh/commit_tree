lightnvm: invalid offset calculation for lba_shift

The ns->lba_shift assumes its value to be the logarithmic of the
LA size. A previous patch duplicated the lba_shift calculation into
lightnvm. It prematurely also subtracted a 512byte shift, which commonly
is applied per-command. The 512byte shift being subtracted twice led to
data loss when restoring the logical to physical mapping table from
device and when issuing I/O commands using rrpc.

Fix offset by removing the 512byte shift subtraction when calculating
lba_shift.
