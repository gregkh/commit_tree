be2net: do not remove vids from driver table if be_vid_config() fails.

The driver currently removes a new vid from the adapter->vids[] array if
be_vid_config() returns an error, which occurs when there is an error in
HW/FW. This is wrong. After the HW/FW error is recovered from, we need the
complete vids[] array to re-program the vlan list.
