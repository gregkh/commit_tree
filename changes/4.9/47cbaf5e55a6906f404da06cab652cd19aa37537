greybus: interface: Rename *_NO_PM as *_NO_BUNDLE_ACTIVATE

Its a special quirk just for the bootrom as it doesn't have any PM
operations implemented. As the greybus bootrom bundle driver doesn't try
to do any PM stuff, this quirk is used only to skip bundle activate
operation currently.

Rename the GB_INTERFACE_QUIRK_NO_PM quirk to
GB_INTERFACE_QUIRK_NO_BUNDLE_ACTIVATE to suit its purpose better as the
GB_INTERFACE_QUIRK_NO_PM will be used for other quirk now.
