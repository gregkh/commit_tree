MIPS: ptrace: Fix regs_return_value for kernel context

Currently regs_return_value always negates reg[2] if it determines
the syscall has failed, but when called in kernel context this check is
invalid and may result in returning a wrong value.

This fixes errors reported by CONFIG_KPROBES_SANITY_TEST
