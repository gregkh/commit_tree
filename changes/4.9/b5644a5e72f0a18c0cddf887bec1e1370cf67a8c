drm/sun4i: Clear encoder->bridge if a bridge is not found

The KMS helpers (drm_atomic_helper_check_modeset/mode_fixup) pass
encoder->bridge directly to drm_bridge_mode_fixup, which expects a
valid pointer, or NULL (in which case it just returns).

Clear encoder->bridge if a bridge is not found, instead of keeping
the ERR_PTR value.

Since other drm_bridge functions also follow this pattern of checking
for a non-NULL pointer, we can drop the ifs around the calls and just
pass the pointer directly.
