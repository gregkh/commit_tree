drm/i915: Introduce i915_gem_active_wait_unlocked()

It is useful to be able to wait on pending rendering without grabbing
the struct_mutex. We can do this by using the i915_gem_active_get_rcu()
primitive to acquire a reference to the pending request without
requiring struct_mutex, just the RCU read lock, and then call
i915_wait_request().

v2: Rebase onto new i915_gem_active_get_unlocked() semantics that take
the RCU read lock on behalf of the caller.
