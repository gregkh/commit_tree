scsi: libiscsi: Fix locking in __iscsi_conn_send_pdu

The code at free_task label in __iscsi_conn_send_pdu can get executed
from blk_timeout_work which takes queue_lock using spin_lock_irq.
back_lock taken with spin_unlock_bh will cause WARN_ON_ONCE.  The code
gets executed either with bottom half or IRQ disabled hence using
spin_lock/spin_unlock for back_lock is safe.
