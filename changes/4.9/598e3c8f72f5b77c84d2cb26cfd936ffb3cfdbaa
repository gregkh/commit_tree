vfs: update ovl inode before relatime check

On overlayfs relatime_need_update() needs inode times to be correct on
overlay inode.  But i_mtime and i_ctime are updated by filesystem code on
underlying inode only, so they will be out-of-date on the overlay inode.

This patch copies the times from the underlying inode if needed.  This
can't be done if called from RCU lookup (link following) but link m/ctime
are not updated by fs, so this is all right.

This patch doesn't change functionality for anything but overlayfs.
