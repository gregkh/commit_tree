MAINTAINERS: Update qlogic networking drivers

Following Cavium's acquisition of qlogic we need to update all the qlogic
drivers maintainer's entries to point to our new e-mail addresses,
as well as update some of the driver's maintainers as those are no longer
working for Cavium.

I would like to thank Sony Chacko and Rajesh Borundia for their support
and development of our various networking drivers.
