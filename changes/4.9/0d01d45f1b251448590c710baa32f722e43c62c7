net: cls_bpf: limit hardware offload by software-only flag

Add cls_bpf support for the TCA_CLS_FLAGS_SKIP_HW flag.
Unlike U32 and flower cls_bpf already has some netlink
flags defined.  Create a new attribute to be able to use
the same flag values as the above.

Unlike U32 and flower reject unknown flags.
