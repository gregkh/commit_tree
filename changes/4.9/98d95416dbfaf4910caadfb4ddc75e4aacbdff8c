sbitmap: randomize initial alloc_hint values

In order to get good cache behavior from a sbitmap, we want each CPU to
stick to its own cacheline(s) as much as possible. This might happen
naturally as the bitmap gets filled up and the alloc_hint values spread
out, but we really want this behavior from the start. blk-mq apparently
intended to do this, but the code to do this was never wired up. Get rid
of the dead code and make it part of the sbitmap library.
