tty: amba-pl011: probe ZTE device from AMBA bus with a pseudo-ID

There is no Peripheral Identification Registers on ZTE PL011 device, so
although the driver amba-pl011 is ready to work for ZTE device, the
device cannot be probed by the driver at all.

With arm,primecell-periphid DT bindings (bindings/arm/primecell.txt) in
place, it should be the cleanest the way to use a pseudo-ID to probe the
device from AMBA bus.  We create an unofficial vendor number
AMBA_VENDOR_LINUX, which will practically never become an official
vendor ID, and takes Configuration, Revision number, and Part number as
input to compose a pseudo-ID for ZTE device.

Also, since we start using vendor_zte to probe ZTE device, the
__maybe_unused for vendor_zte is removed.
