iommu/vt-d: Fix PASID table allocation

Somehow I ended up with an off-by-three error in calculating the size of
the PASID and PASID State tables, which triggers allocations failures as
those tables unfortunately have to be physically contiguous.

In fact, even the *correct* maximum size of 8MiB is problematic and is
wont to lead to allocation failures. Since I have extracted a promise
that this *will* be fixed in hardware, I'm happy to limit it on the
current hardware to a maximum of 0x20000 PASIDs, which gives us 1MiB
tables â€” still not ideal, but better than before.

Reported by Mika Kuoppala <mika.kuoppala@linux.intel.com> and also by
Xunlei Pang <xlpang@redhat.com> who submitted a simpler patch to fix
only the allocation (and not the free) to the "correct" limit... which
was still problematic.
