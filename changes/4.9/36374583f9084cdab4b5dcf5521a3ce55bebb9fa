clocksource: Defer override invalidation unless clock is unstable

Clocksources don't get the VALID_FOR_HRES flag until they have been
checked by a watchdog. However, when using an override, the
clocksource_select logic will clear the override value if the
clocksource is not marked VALID_FOR_HRES during that inititial check.
When using the boot arguments clocksource=<foo>, this selection can
run before the watchdog, and can cause the override to be incorrectly
cleared.

To address this condition, the override_name is only invalidated for
unstable clocksources. Otherwise, the override is left intact until after
the watchdog has validated the clocksource as stable/unstable.
