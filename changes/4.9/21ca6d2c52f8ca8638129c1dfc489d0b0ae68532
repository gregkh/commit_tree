cpufreq: schedutil: Add iowait boosting

Modify the schedutil cpufreq governor to boost the CPU
frequency if the SCHED_CPUFREQ_IOWAIT flag is passed to
it via cpufreq_update_util().

If that happens, the frequency is set to the maximum during
the first update after receiving the SCHED_CPUFREQ_IOWAIT flag
and then the boost is reduced by half during each following update.
