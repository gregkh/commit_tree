mm,ksm: add __GFP_HIGH to the allocation in alloc_stable_node()

According to Hugh's suggestion, alloc_stable_node() with GFP_KERNEL can
in rare cases cause a hung task warning.

At present, if alloc_stable_node() allocation fails, two break_cows may
want to allocate a couple of pages, and the issue will come up when free
memory is under pressure.

We fix it by adding __GFP_HIGH to GFP, to grant access to memory
reserves, increasing the likelihood of allocation success.
