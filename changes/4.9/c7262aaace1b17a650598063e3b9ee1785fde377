net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: fix device and of_node leaks

Make sure to drop the references taken by of_get_child_by_name() and
bus_find_device() before returning from cpsw_phy_sel().

Note that holding a reference to the cpsw-phy-sel device does not
prevent the devres-managed private data from going away.
