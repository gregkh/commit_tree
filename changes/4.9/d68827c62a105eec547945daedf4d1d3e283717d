tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: fix clearing of receive flag

Commit 8e4934c6d6c6 ("tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: clear receive flag on FIFO
flush") implemented clearing of the receive flag by reading the status register
only. It turned out that even though we flush the FIFO afterwards, a explicit
read of the data register is still required.

This leads to a FIFO underrun. To avoid this, follow the advice in the overrun
"Operation section": Unconditionally clear RXUF after using RXFLUSH.
