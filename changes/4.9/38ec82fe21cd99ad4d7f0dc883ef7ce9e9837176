MIPS: Malta: Probe interrupt controllers via DT

Probe the CPU, GIC & i8259 interrupt controllers present in the Malta
system using device tree. This enables interrupts to be provided to
devices using device tree as they are moved over to being probed using
it.

Since Malta is very configurable it's unknown whether a GIC will be
present at compile time. In order to support both cases the
malta_dt_shim code is added in order to detect whether a GIC is present,
adjusting the DT to route interrupts correctly and nop out the GIC node
if no GIC is found.
