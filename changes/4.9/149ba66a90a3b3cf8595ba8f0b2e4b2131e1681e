drivers/pci/hotplug: Remove likely() and unlikely() in powernv driver

This removes likely() and unlikely() in pnv_php.c as the code isn't
running in hot path. Those macros to affect CPU's branch stream don't
help a lot for performance. I used them to identify the cases are
likely or unlikely to happen. No logical changes introduced.
