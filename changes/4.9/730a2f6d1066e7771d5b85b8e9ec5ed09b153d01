greybus: control: Warn if non-control cport/bundles have control protocol/classes

It is possible that (by mistake) the manifest contains non-control
cports with their protocol set as control-protocol or non-control bundle
with their class set as control-class.

Catch such cases, WARN for them and finally ignore them.

Also WARN if the control cport doesn't have its protocol as
control-protocol and control bundle doesn't have its class as
control-class.
