drm/i915: Drop mutex around clearing error state

The error state itself is guarded by a spinlock (admittedly even that is
overkill for a single pointer!) and doesn't require us to take the
struct_mutex in the debugfs/sysfs interface. Removing the struct_mutex
removes one more potential blockage when trying to debug a deadlock.
