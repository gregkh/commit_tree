arm64: KVM: Allow an exit code to be tagged with an SError

Similarily to EL1, an asynchronous abort can be triggered whilst
running at EL2. But instead of making that a new error code,
we need to communicate it to the rest of KVM together with
the exit reason. So let's hijack a single bit that allows the
exception code to be tagged with a "pending SError" information.
