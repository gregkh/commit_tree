ARM: dts: ARM: dts: Fix omap5 SDIO dat1 interrupt

Few changes to fix issues I've noticed while debugging omap5-uevm
wl18xx issues:

1. Move wlcore irq pin muxing under wlcore. This irq could be
   different from gpio_wk14 on some board variants

2. Don't configure pull on wlcore irq pin. There is a 10k
   pull up resistor R105 on the device to VDDS_1v8_MAIN

3. The padconf register for wlsdio_data1 is wrong, it's really
   at 0x1a8 + 2 - 0x40 = 0x16a offset, not at 0x168 as that's
   for wlsdio_data0

4. Mark the omap5-uevm wlan as compatible with ti,wl1837 as
   that's what the TDK R078 part seems to be

5. The MMC interrupt for WLAN musb be wakeupgen, not gic

Looks like omap5-uevm WLAN behaves better now, but I still seem
to have issues with some access points.
