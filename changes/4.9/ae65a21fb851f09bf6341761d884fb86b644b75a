lib/stackdepot: export save/fetch stack for drivers

Some drivers would like to record stacktraces in order to aide leak
tracing.  As stackdepot already provides a facility for only storing the
unique traces, thereby reducing the memory required, export that
functionality for use by drivers.

The code was originally created for KASAN and moved under lib in commit
cd11016e5f521 ("mm, kasan: stackdepot implementation.  Enable stackdepot
for SLAB") so that it could be shared with mm/.  In turn, we want to
share it now with drivers.
