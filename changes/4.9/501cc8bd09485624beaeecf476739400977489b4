greybus: Fix probing of gpbridge devices

The gpbridge core tries to match the driver's id-table against all
CPorts available within the bundle for which the gpbridge bus was
created. The gpbdev here is unique for a cport_desc and only a single
cport_desc->protocol_id should be matched with the driver's id-table.

Fix it.

Tested on EVT 1.5 with a special manifest for GP module, where multiple
CPorts are part of the same Bridged PHY bundle.
