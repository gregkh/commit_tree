greybus: loopback: register a struct device.

Instead of having the loopback attributes in the bundle device,
Add a struct device to the gb_loopback struct and register it on
connection_init, deregister it at connection_exit, and move the
loopback attribute group over to the new device.

Use device_create_with_groups to create sysfs attributes
together with device.
