cxgb4: mark cxgb_setup_tc() static

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/net/ethernet/chelsio/cxgb4/cxgb4_main.c:2715:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'cxgb_setup_tc' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, this function is only used in the file in which it is
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks this function with 'static'.
