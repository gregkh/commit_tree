xfs: don't warn on buffers not being recovered due to LSN

The log recovery buffer validation function is invoked in cases where a
buffer update may be skipped due to LSN ordering. If the validation
function happens to come across directory conversion situations (e.g., a
dir3 block to data conversion), it may warn about seeing a buffer log
format of one type and a buffer with a magic number of another.

This warning is not valid as the buffer update is ultimately skipped.
This is indicated by a current_lsn of NULLCOMMITLSN provided by the
caller. As such, update xlog_recover_validate_buf_type() to only warn in
such cases when a buffer update is expected.
