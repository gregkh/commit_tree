iommu/vt-d: Fix IOMMU lookup for SR-IOV Virtual Functions

The VT-d specification (§8.3.3) says:
    ‘Virtual Functions’ of a ‘Physical Function’ are under the scope
    of the same remapping unit as the ‘Physical Function’.

The BIOS is not required to list all the possible VFs in the scope
tables, and arguably *shouldn't* make any attempt to do so, since there
could be a huge number of them.

This has been broken basically for ever — the VF is never going to match
against a specific unit's scope, so it ends up being assigned to the
INCLUDE_ALL IOMMU. Which was always actually correct by coincidence, but
now we're looking at Root-Complex integrated devices with SR-IOV support
it's going to start being wrong.

Fix it to simply use pci_physfn() before doing the lookup for PCI devices.
