powerpc: Remove static branch prediction in atomic{, 64}_add_unless

I see quite a lot of static branch mispredictions on a simple
web serving workload. The issue is in __atomic_add_unless(), called
from _atomic_dec_and_lock(). There is no obvious common case, so it
is better to let the hardware predict the branch.
