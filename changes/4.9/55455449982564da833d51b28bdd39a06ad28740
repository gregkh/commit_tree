platform/x86: toshiba_haps: Split ACPI and HDD protection error handling

Currently the code checking for the ACPI status is mixed along with
the actual HDD protection status check.

This patch splits those two checks as they are not related, printing
an error string in case the ACPI call failed, and then check for
actual HDD protection status.
