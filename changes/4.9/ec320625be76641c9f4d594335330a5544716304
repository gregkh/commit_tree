greybus: Define cport/bundle for SVC protocol

For now, the plan is to use a single cport for both control and svc
protocol. Defining separate macros for control and svc protocol's
cport/bundle would make the code more flexible, in case we need two
separate cports in future.

Lets define cport/bundle for svc protocol as well.
