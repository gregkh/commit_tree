drm/i915: i915_vma_move_to_active prep patch

This patch is broken out of the next just to remove the code motion from
that patch and make it more readable. What we do here is move the
i915_vma_move_to_active() to i915_gem_execbuffer.c and put the three
stages (read, write, fenced) together so that future modifications to
active handling are all located in the same spot. The importance of this
is so that we can more simply control the order in which the requests
are place in the retirement list (i.e. control the order at which we
retire and so control the lifetimes to avoid having to hold onto
references).
