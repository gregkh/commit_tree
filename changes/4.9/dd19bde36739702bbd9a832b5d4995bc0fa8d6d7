switchdev: Fix return value of switchdev_port_fdb_dump().

This patch fixes the retun value of switchdev_port_fdb_dump() when
CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV is not set. This avoids getting "warning: return makes
integer from pointer without a cast [-Wint-conversion]" when building
when CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV is not set under several compiler versions.
This warning is due to commit d297653dd6f07afbe7e6c702a4bcd7615680002e
("rtnetlink: fdb dump: optimize by saving last interface markers").
