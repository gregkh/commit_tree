xprtrdma: Use smaller buffers for RPC-over-RDMA headers

Commit 949317464bc2 ("xprtrdma: Limit number of RDMA segments in
RPC-over-RDMA headers") capped the number of chunks that may appear
in RPC-over-RDMA headers. The maximum header size can be estimated
and fixed to avoid allocating buffer space that is never used.
