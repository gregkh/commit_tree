irqchip/gicv3-its: Refactor ITS DT init code to prepare for ACPI

In order to add ACPI support we need to isolate ACPI&DT common code and
move DT logic to corresponding functions. To achieve this we are using
firmware agnostic handle which can be unpacked to either DT or ACPI node.

No functional changes other than a very minor one:
1. Terminate its_init call with -ENODEV for non-DT case which allows
to remove hack from its-gic-v3.c.
2. Fix ITS base register address type (from 'unsigned long' to 'phys_addr_t'),
as a bonus we get nice string formatting.
3. Since there is only one of ITS parent domain convert it to static global
variable and drop the parameter from its_probe_one. Users can refer to it
in more convenient way then.
