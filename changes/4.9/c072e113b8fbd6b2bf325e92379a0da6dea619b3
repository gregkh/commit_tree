dmaengine: dw: set polarity of handshake interface

Intel Quark UART uses DesignWare DMA IP. Though the DMA IP is connected in such
way that handshake interface uses inverted polarity. We have to provide a
possibility to set this in the DMA driver when configuring a channel.

Introduce a new member of custom slave configuration called 'hs_polarity' and
set active low polarity in case this value is 'true'.
