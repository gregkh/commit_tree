s390/pci_dma: improve map_sg

Our map_sg implementation mapped sg entries independently of each other.
For ease of use and possible performance improvements this patch changes
the implementation to try to map as many (likely physically non-contiguous)
sglist entries as possible into a contiguous DMA segment.
