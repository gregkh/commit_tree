greybus: camera: Create and destroy data connection on demand

Creating the data connection at probe time makes it impossible to
support multiple inserted camera modules as they would all try to
establish a data connection to the same CPort on the AP side. Create and
destroy the data connection when configuring the streams instead, as a
single module can be streaming at a time.
