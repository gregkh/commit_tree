greybus: connection: fix oops after failed init

Make sure not to call connection_exit for connections that have never
been initialised (e.g. due to failure to init).

This fixes oopses due to null-dereferences and use-after-free in
connection_exit callbacks (e.g. trying to remove a gpio-chip that has
never been added) when the bundle and interface are ultimately
destroyed.
