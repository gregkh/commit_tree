drm/i915: Mark the context and address space as closed

When the user closes the context mark it and the dependent address space
as closed. As we use an asynchronous destruct method, this has two
purposes.  First it allows us to flag the closed context and detect
internal errors if we to create any new objects for it (as it is removed
from the user's namespace, these should be internal bugs only). And
secondly, it allows us to immediately reap stale vma.
