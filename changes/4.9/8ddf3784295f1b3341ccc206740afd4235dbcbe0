[media] v4l: vsp1: Replace .set_memory() with VSP1_ENTITY_PARAMS_PARTITION

The new VSP1_ENTITY_PARAMS_PARTITION configuration parameters type
covers all registers that need to be configured for every partition.
This prepares for support of image partitioning, and replaces the
.set_memory() operation as the memory registers take different values
for every partition.
