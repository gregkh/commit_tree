fs: proc: Delete inode time initializations in proc_alloc_inode()

proc uses new_inode_pseudo() to allocate a new inode.
This in turn calls the proc_inode_alloc() callback.
But, at this point, inode is still not initialized
with the super_block pointer which only happens just
before alloc_inode() returns after the call to
inode_init_always().

Also, the inode times are initialized again after the
call to new_inode_pseudo() in proc_inode_alloc().
The assignemet in proc_alloc_inode() is redundant and
also doesn't work after the current_time() api is
changed to take struct inode* instead of
struct *super_block.

This bug was reported after current_time() was used to
assign times in proc_alloc_inode().
