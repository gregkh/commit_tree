Drivers: hv: make VMBus bus ids persistent

Some tools use bus ids to identify devices and they count on the fact
that these ids are persistent across reboot. This may be not true for
VMBus as we use auto incremented counter from alloc_channel() as such
id. Switch to using if_instance from channel offer, this id is supposed
to be persistent.
