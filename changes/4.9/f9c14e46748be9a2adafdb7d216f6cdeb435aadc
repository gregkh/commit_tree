net/mlx5: Fix query ISSI flow

In old FWs query ISSI command is not supported and for some of those FWs
it might fail with status other than "MLX5_CMD_STAT_BAD_OP_ERR".

In such case instead of failing the driver load, we will treat any FW
status other than 0 for Query ISSI FW command as ISSI not supported and
assume ISSI=0 (most basic driver/FW interface).

In case of driver syndrom (query ISSI failure by driver) we will fail
driver load.

Ethernet functionality')
