staging: unisys: visorinput: remove unnecessary locking

Locking in the _interrupt() function is NOT necessary so long as we ensure
that interrupts have been stopped whenever we need to pause or resume the
device, which we now do.

While a device is paused, we ensure that interrupts stay disabled, i.e.
that the _interrupt() function will NOT be called, yet remember the desired
state in devdata->interrupts_enabled if open() or close() are called are
called while the device is paused.  Then when the device is resumed, we
restore the actual state of interrupts (i.e., whether _interrupt() is going
to be called or not) to the desired state in devdata->interrupts_enabled.
