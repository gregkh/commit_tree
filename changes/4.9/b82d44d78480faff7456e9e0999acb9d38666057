net: fec: set mac address unconditionally

If the mac address origin is not dt, you can only safely assign a mac
address after "link up" of the device. If the link is off the clocks are
disabled and because of issues assigning registers when clocks are off the
new mac address cannot be written in .ndo_set_mac_address() on some soc's.
This fix sets the mac address unconditionally in fec_restart(...) and
ensures consistency between fec registers and the network layer.
