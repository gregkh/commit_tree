docs-rst: enable the Sphinx math extension

This extension will be used by the media books.

The name of the math image extension changed on Sphinx 1.4.x,
according with:
	http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/math.html#module-sphinx.ext.imgmath

Let's autodetect, to keep building with versions < 1.4.
