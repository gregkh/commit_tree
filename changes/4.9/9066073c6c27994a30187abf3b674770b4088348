thermal: qcom: tsens: Add a skeletal TSENS drivers

TSENS is Qualcomms' thermal temperature sensor device. It
supports reading temperatures from multiple thermal sensors
present on various QCOM SoCs.
Calibration data is generally read from a non-volatile memory
(eeprom) device.

Add a skeleton driver with all the necessary abstractions so
a variety of qcom device families which support TSENS can
add driver extensions.

Also add the required device tree bindings which can be used
to describe the TSENS device in DT.
