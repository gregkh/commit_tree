be2net: Add DEVSEC privilege to SET_HSW_CONFIG command.

OPCODE_COMMON_GET_FN_PRIVILEGES is returning only DEVSEC
privilege (Unrestricted Administrative Privilege) for Lancer NIC functions.
So, driver is failing SET_HSW_CONFIG command, as DEVSEC privilege was not
set in the privilege bitmap. This patch fixes the problem by setting DEVSEC
privilege in SET_HSW_CONFIGâ€™s privilege bitmap.
