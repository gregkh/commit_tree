drm/doc: Light drm-kms-helper.rst cleanup

- Move the common vtable stuff to the top
- Move "Tile Group" to a more appropriate heading level
- Throw away the old intro for the crtc helpers (it's entirely stale,
  e.g. helpers have become modular years ago), and replace it with a
  general intro about the motivation behind helpers.
- Reorder helpers to group them together a bit better, and explain
  that grouping in the intro.
- Make sure the introductory DOC section is always first.

v2:
- Remove bogus files accidentally added (Sean).
- Spelling fixes (Sean).
