USB: cdc-acm: fix TIOCMIWAIT

The TIOCMIWAIT implementation would return -EINVAL if any of the three
supported signals were included in the mask.

Instead of returning an error in case TIOCM_CTS is included, simply
drop the mask check completely, which is in accordance with how other
drivers implement this ioctl.
