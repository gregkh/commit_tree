greybus: arche-platform: Export fn to allow timesync driver to change the state

With the addition of the timesync driver and looking at the hardware
interfaces we have, its clear we need to add a new arche-platform state.

This patch adds ARCHE_PLATFORM_STATE_TIME_SYNC to the arche-platform driver
to facilitate transition to the TIME_SYNC state if-and-only-if the
arche-platform driver is in the ACTIVE state.

This is mainly needed as wake/detect lines are shared between TIMESYNC
operation and basic control functionality of APBs. So during TIMESYNC
we want to make sure that the events on wake/detect lines are
ignored by the arche-platform APB reset logic.

This patch adds one exported function, which can be invoked from
timesync driver code, allowing, switching between
ARCHE_PLATFORM_STATE_TIME_SYNC <=> ARCHE_PLATFORM_STATE_ACTIVE states.
