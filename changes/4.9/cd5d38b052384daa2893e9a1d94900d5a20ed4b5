ARCv2: fix local_save_flags

Commit d9676fa152c83b ("ARCv2: Enable LOCKDEP"), changed
local_save_flags() to not return raw STATUS32 but encoded in the form
such that it could be fed directly to CLRI/SETI instructions.
However the STATUS32.E[] was not captured correctly as it corresponds to
bits [4:1] in the register and not [3:0]
