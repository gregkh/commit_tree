md-cluster: call md_kick_rdev_from_array once ack failed

The new_disk_ack could return failure if WAITING_FOR_NEWDISK
is not set, so we need to kick the dev from array in case
failure happened.

And we missed to check err before call new_disk_ack othwise
we could kick a rdev which isn't in array, thanks for the
reminder from Shaohua.
