clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: Fix the clock provider registration

While trying using a peripheral clock on a driver, I saw that the clock
pointer returned by the provider was NULL.

The problem was a missing indirection. It was the pointer stored in the
hws array which needed to be updated not the value it contains.
