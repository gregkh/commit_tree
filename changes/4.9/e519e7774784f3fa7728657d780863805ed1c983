splice: remove detritus from generic_file_splice_read()

i_size check is a leftover from the horrors that used to play with
the page cache in that function.  With the switch to ->read_iter(),
it's neither needed nor correct - for gfs2 it ends up being buggy,
since i_size is not guaranteed to be correct until later (inside
->read_iter()).
