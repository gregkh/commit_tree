netfilter: nf_tables: ensure proper initialization of nft_pktinfo fields

This patch introduces nft_set_pktinfo_unspec() that ensures proper
initialization all of pktinfo fields for non-IP traffic. This is used
by the bridge, netdev and arp families.

This new function relies on nft_set_pktinfo_proto_unspec() to set a new
tprot_set field that indicates if transport protocol information is
available. Remain fields are zeroed.

The meta expression has been also updated to check to tprot_set in first
place given that zero is a valid tprot value. Even a handcrafted packet
may come with the IPPROTO_RAW (255) protocol number so we can't rely on
this value as tprot unset.
