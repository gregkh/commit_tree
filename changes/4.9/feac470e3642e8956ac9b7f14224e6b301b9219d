xfs: convert COW blocks to real blocks before unwritten extent conversion

We need to splice COW blocks we've completed in xfs_end_io_direct_write
into the data fork before converting unwritten extents.  Otherwise
xfs_bmapi_write might first allocate blocks for any holes in the data
fork, which isn't only not needed but also harmful as it might cause
reserved block underruns in the transaction.
