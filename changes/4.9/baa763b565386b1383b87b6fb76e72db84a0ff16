arm64: alternative: Disallow patching instructions using literals

The alternative code patching doesn't check if the replaced instruction
uses a pc relative literal. This could cause silent corruption in the
instruction stream as the instruction will be executed from a different
address than what it was compiled for. Catch all such cases.
