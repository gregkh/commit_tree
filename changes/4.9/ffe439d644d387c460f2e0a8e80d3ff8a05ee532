video: ARM CLCD: export symbols for driver module

The amba-clcd-versatile.c code is always built-in and has to
be done that way because it gets called by platform code that is
also built-in. However, it now also gets called from the
core CLCD driver through the .init_panel callback function,
which leads to a build error when the framebuffer is configured
as a loadable module:

ERROR: "versatile_clcd_init_panel" [drivers/video/fbdev/amba-clcd-mod.ko] undefined!

The same thing happens for the nomadik driver, although that
could be linked into the core module if we want to:

ERROR: "nomadik_clcd_init_panel" [drivers/video/fbdev/amba-clcd.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "nomadik_clcd_init_board" [drivers/video/fbdev/amba-clcd.ko] undefined!

For consistency, I'm taking the same approach in both cases here
and just export the functions to make them usable by the driver.

Alternatively, we could split out the CONFIG_OF-code from amba-clcd-versatile.c
into a new file and link those two together with the core driver as one
module.
