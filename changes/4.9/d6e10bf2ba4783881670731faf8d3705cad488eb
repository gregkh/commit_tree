usb: dwc3: avoid -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

Cleaning up the loop in dwc3_cleanup_done_reqs() introduced a
gcc warning if built with "-Wmaybe-uninitialized":

drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c: In function 'dwc3_endpoint_transfer_complete':
drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c:2015:9: 'trb' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

I believe it is a false positive and we always have a valid 'trb'
pointer at the end of the function, but neither I nor the compiler
are able to prove that.

This works around the warning by computing a flag earlier in the function
when it's guaranteed to be valid, which tells the compiler that it's
safe and makes it easier to understand to me.
