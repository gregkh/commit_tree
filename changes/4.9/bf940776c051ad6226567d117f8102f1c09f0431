fs/ocfs2/cluster: remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue()

The workqueue "o2net_wq" queues multiple work items viz
&old_sc->sc_shutdown_work, &sc->sc_rx_work, &sc->sc_connect_work which
require strict execution ordering.  Hence, an ordered dedicated
workqueue has been used.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under memory
pressure.
