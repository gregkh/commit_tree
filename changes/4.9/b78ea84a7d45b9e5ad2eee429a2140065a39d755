phy-twl4030-usb: initialize charging-related stuff via pm_runtime

twl4030_phy_power_on() initializes some bits which are required for
charging. As they are not set in twl4030_usb_runtime_resume()
a call to pm_runtime_get_sync() is not sufficient to enable charging.

This patch moves the initialization to twl4030_usb_runtime_resume()
so everything needed for charging is initialized upon
pm_runtime_get_sync().

That also gives improved possibilities to debug problems in that area
because the relevant parts can be checked separately. Charging can be
enabled without having the musb subsystem active.

As a side effect this hides some bugs in musb which causes
unbalanced calls to phy_power_off()/phy_power_on() so that
phy->power_count becomes -1.

The result is that e.g. the GTA04 phone (dm3730 + twl4030) works
finally as a usb gadget again and charging is working.
