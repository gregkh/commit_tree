arm64: mm: convert __dma_* routines to use start, size

__dma_* routines have been converted to use start and size instread of
start and end addresses. The patch was origianlly for adding
__clean_dcache_area_poc() which will be used in pmem driver to clean
dcache to the PoC(Point of Coherency) in arch_wb_cache_pmem().

The functionality of __clean_dcache_area_poc()  was equivalent to
__dma_clean_range(). The difference was __dma_clean_range() uses the end
address, but __clean_dcache_area_poc() uses the size to clean.

Thus, __clean_dcache_area_poc() has been revised with a fallthrough
function of __dma_clean_range() after the change that __dma_* routines
use start and size instead of using start and end.

As a consequence of using start and size, the name of __dma_* routines
has also been altered following the terminology below:
    area: takes a start and size
    range: takes a start and end
