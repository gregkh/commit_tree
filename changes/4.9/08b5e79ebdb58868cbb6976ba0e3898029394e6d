powerpc/mm: Drop dump_numa_memory_topology()

At boot we dump the NUMA memory topology in dump_numa_memory_topology(),
at KERN_DEBUG level, resulting in output like:

  Node 0 Memory: 0x0-0x100000000
  Node 1 Memory: 0x100000000-0x200000000

Which is nice enough, but immediately after that we iterate over each
node and call setup_node_data(), which also prints out the node ranges,
at KERN_INFO, giving eg:

  numa: Initmem setup node 0 [mem 0x00000000-0xffffffff]
  numa: Initmem setup node 1 [mem 0x100000000-0x1ffffffff]

Additionally dump_numa_memory_topology() does not use KERN_CONT
correctly, resulting in split output lines on recent kernels.

So drop dump_numa_memory_topology() as superfluous chatter.
