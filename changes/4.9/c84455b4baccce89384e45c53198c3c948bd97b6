drm/i915: Move debug only per-request pid tracking from request to ctx

Since contexts are not currently shared between userspace processes, we
have an exact correspondence between context creator and guilty batch
submitter. Therefore we can save some per-batch work by inspecting the
context->pid upon error instead. Note that we take the context's
creator's pid rather than the file's pid in order to better track fd
passed over sockets.
