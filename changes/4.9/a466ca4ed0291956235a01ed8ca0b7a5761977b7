staging: lustre: lprocfs: cleanup stats locking code

Add comment blocks on lprocfs_stats_lock() and lprocfs_stats_unlock().
Move common NOPERCPU code out of the switch() statements to reduce
code size and complexity, since it doesn't depend on the opc at all.

Replace switch() in lprocfs_stats_unlock() with a simple if/else,
since the lock opc was already checked in lprocfs_stats_lock().

Add an enum for the lprocfs_stats_lock() operations to make it clear
what the valid values are and allow compiler checking.
