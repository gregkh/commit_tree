gpio/gpiolib: Forbid irqchip default trigger if probed over DT

Using a default trigger is a bad idea if using DT to configure
interrupts, as the device's interrupt specifier will always contain
the trigger configuration.

Let's warn about that particular situation, and revert to not
having a default. Hopefully, the couple of drivers still using
this feature will quickly be fixed.
