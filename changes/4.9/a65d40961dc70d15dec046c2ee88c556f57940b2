kthread/smpboot: do not park in kthread_create_on_cpu()

kthread_create_on_cpu() was added by the commit 2a1d446019f9a5983e
("kthread: Implement park/unpark facility").  It is currently used only
when enabling new CPU.  For this purpose, the newly created kthread has to
be parked.

The CPU binding is a bit tricky.  The kthread is parked when the CPU has
not been allowed yet.  And the CPU is bound when the kthread is unparked.

The function would be useful for more per-CPU kthreads, e.g.
bnx2fc_thread, fcoethread.  For this purpose, the newly created kthread
should stay in the uninterruptible state.

This patch moves the parking into smpboot.  It binds the thread already
when created.  Then the function might be used universally.  Also the
behavior is consistent with kthread_create() and kthread_create_on_node().
