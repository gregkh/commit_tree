ACPICA: Clib: Fix wrong mini C library usage

ACPICA commit 4aab18466b56f3660f27cffd3c0160900737f844

When mini C library is used, we should have the following macros undefined.
The only user should be the EFI applications:
  ACPI_USE_SYSTEM_CLIBRARY=n
  ACPI_USE_STANDARD_HEADERS=n
All other applications uses the compiler specific library:
  ACPI_USE_SYSTEM_CLIBRARY=y
  ACPI_USE_STANDARD_HEADERS=y
Linux/BSD kernels are the kind of hosts providing C library but does not
provide the standard headers:
  ACPI_USE_SYSTEM_CLIBRARY=y
  ACPI_USE_STANDARD_HEADERS=n
But the above logic hasn't been synchronized between the header files.

This patch synchronizes all header files to correct C library usages for
different platforms. This patch moves all ACPI_USE_SYSTEM_CLIRARY and
ACPI_USE_STANDARD_HEADERS to the top most lines of a platform specific
header.

After synchronization, ACPI_USE_SYSTEM_CLIRARY definition can be removed
for ACPI_APPLICATION. Lv Zheng.
