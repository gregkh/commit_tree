btrfs: let btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() to clean relocated bgs

Currently, btrfs_relocate_chunk() is removing relocated BG by itself. But
the work can be done by btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() (and it's better since it
trim the BG). Let's dedupe the code.

While btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() is already hitting the relocated BG, it
skip the BG since the BG has "ro" flag set (to keep balancing BG intact).
On the other hand, btrfs cannot drop "ro" flag here to prevent additional
writes. So this patch make use of "removed" flag.
btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() now detect the flag to distinguish whether a
read-only BG is relocating or not.
