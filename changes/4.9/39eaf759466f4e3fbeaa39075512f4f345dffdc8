crypto: caam - fix pointer size for AArch64 boot loader, AArch32 kernel

Start with a clean slate before dealing with bit 16 (pointer size)
of Master Configuration Register.
This fixes the case of AArch64 boot loader + AArch32 kernel, when
the boot loader might set MCFGR[PS] and kernel would fail to clear it.
