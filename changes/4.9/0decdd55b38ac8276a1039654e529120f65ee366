greybus: Revert "interface: Fetch and expose version of interface's firmware"

This reverts commit b957ade7b3e4ab8c149c53346dbf02e977b7f3a7.

The interface version is now managed as part of the firmware-management
protocol. This operation is already removed from the greybus
specifications.

Drop interface version support from greybus.

Tested with gbsim (sysfs file not available after this patch).
