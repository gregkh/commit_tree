serial: core: Fix handling of options after MMIO address

Guenter Roeck reported a regression caused by commit "serial: earlycon:
Extend earlycon command line option to support 64-bit addresses":

console= and earlycon= options have the following format:
...,<addr>,<options>

Historically used here simple_strtoul() had no problems with comma, but the
new and recommended kstrtoull() requires null-terminated string and returns
-EINVAL in case there are "options" at the end. There is no recommended to
use function currently that will support it, so stick to obsolete
simple_strtoull() variant.
