rps: Inspect PPTP encapsulated by GRE to get flow hash

The PPTP is encapsulated by GRE header with that GRE_VERSION bits
must contain one. But current GRE RPS needs the GRE_VERSION must be
zero. So RPS does not work for PPTP traffic.

In my test environment, there are four MIPS cores, and all traffic
are passed through by PPTP. As a result, only one core is 100% busy
while other three cores are very idle. After this patch, the usage
of four cores are balanced well.
