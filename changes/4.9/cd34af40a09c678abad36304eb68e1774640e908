scsi: cxlflash: Transition to application close model

Caching the adapter file descriptor and performing a close on behalf of
an application is a poor design. This is due to the fact that once a
file descriptor in installed, it is free to be altered without the
knowledge of the cxlflash driver. This can lead to inconsistencies
between the application and kernel. Furthermore, the nature of the
former design is more exploitable and thus should be abandoned.

To support applications performing a close on the adapter file that is
associated with a context, a new flag is introduced to the user API to
indicate to applications that they are responsible for the close
following the cleanup (detach) of a context. The documentation is also
updated to reflect this change in behavior.
