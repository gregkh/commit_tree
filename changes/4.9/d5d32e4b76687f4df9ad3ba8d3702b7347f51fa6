net: ipv6: Do not consider link state for nexthop validation

Similar to IPv4, do not consider link state when validating next hops.

Currently, if the link is down default routes can fail to insert:
 $ ip -6 ro add vrf blue default via 2100:2::64 dev eth2
 RTNETLINK answers: No route to host

With this patch the command succeeds.
