SUNRPC remove rpc_task_release_client from rpc_task_set_client

rpc_task_set_client is only called from rpc_run_task after
rpc_new_task and rpc_task_release_client is not needed as the
task is new.

When called from rpc_new_task, rpc_task_set_client also removed the
assigned rpc_xprt which is not desired.
