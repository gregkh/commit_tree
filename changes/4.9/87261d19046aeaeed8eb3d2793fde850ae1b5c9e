arm64: Cortex-A53 errata workaround: check for kernel addresses

Commit 7dd01aef0557 ("arm64: trap userspace "dc cvau" cache operation on
errata-affected core") adds code to execute cache maintenance instructions
in the kernel on behalf of userland on CPUs with certain ARM CPU errata.
It turns out that the address hasn't been checked to be a valid user
space address, allowing userland to clean cache lines in kernel space.
Fix this by introducing an address check before executing the
instructions on behalf of userland.

Since the address doesn't come via a syscall parameter, we can't just
reject tagged pointers and instead have to remove the tag when checking
against the user address limit.
