ALSA: hda - Adding one more ALC255 pin definition for headset problem

We have two new Dell laptop models, they have the same ALC255 pin
definition, but not in the pin quirk table yet, as a result, the
headset microphone can't work. After adding the definition in the
table, the headset microphone works well.
