ipv4: fix value of ->nlmsg_flags reported in RTM_NEWROUTE events

fib_table_insert() inconsistently fills the nlmsg_flags field in its
notification messages.

Since commit b8f558313506 ("[RTNETLINK]: Fix sending netlink message
when replace route."), the netlink message has its nlmsg_flags set to
NLM_F_REPLACE if the route replaced a preexisting one.

Then commit a2bb6d7d6f42 ("ipv4: include NLM_F_APPEND flag in append
route notifications") started setting nlmsg_flags to NLM_F_APPEND if
the route matched a preexisting one but was appended.

In other cases (exclusive creation or prepend), nlmsg_flags is 0.

This patch sets ->nlmsg_flags in all situations, preserving the
semantic of the NLM_F_* bits:

  * NLM_F_CREATE: a new fib entry has been created for this route.
  * NLM_F_EXCL: no other fib entry existed for this route.
  * NLM_F_REPLACE: this route has overwritten a preexisting fib entry.
  * NLM_F_APPEND: the new fib entry was added after other entries for
    the same route.

As a result, the possible flag combination can now be reported
(iproute2's terminology into parentheses):

  * NLM_F_CREATE | NLM_F_EXCL: route didn't exist, exclusive creation
    ("add").
  * NLM_F_CREATE | NLM_F_APPEND: route did already exist, new route
    added after preexisting ones ("append").
  * NLM_F_CREATE: route did already exist, new route added before
    preexisting ones ("prepend").
  * NLM_F_REPLACE: route did already exist, new route replaced the
    first preexisting one ("change").
