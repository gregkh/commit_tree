ASoC: Intel: remove status, it is shadowing status of a higher scope

The second declaration of status is shadowing the status of a higher
scope.  This uninitialized status results in garbage being returned
by the !x86_match_cpu(cpu_ids) || !iosf_mbi_available() return exit
path.  Fix this by removing the extraneous second declaration of
status.
