rhashtable: Remove GFP flag from rhashtable_walk_init

The commit 8f6fd83c6c5ec66a4a70c728535ddcdfef4f3697 ("rhashtable:
accept GFP flags in rhashtable_walk_init") added a GFP flag argument
to rhashtable_walk_init because some users wish to use the walker
in an unsleepable context.

In fact we don't need to allocate memory in rhashtable_walk_init
at all.  The walker is always paired with an iterator so we could
just stash ourselves there.

This patch does that by introducing a new enter function to replace
the existing init function.  This way we don't have to churn all
the existing users again.
