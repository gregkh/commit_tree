staging: lustre: ldlm: revert the changes for lock canceling policy

The changes for LRU lock policy was introduced by commit bfae5a4e,
where I was trying to revise the policy to pick locks for canceling.

However, this caused two problems as mentioned in LU-5727. The first
problem is that the lock can only be picked for canceling only if
the number of LRU locks is over preset LRU number AND it's aged; the
second problem is that mdc_cancel_weight() tends to not cancel OPEN
locks, therefore open locks can be kept forever and finally exhausts
memory on the MDT side.

The commit 7b2d26b0 ("revert changes to ldlm_cancel_aged_policy") fixed
the first problem. This patch will revert the rest of changes related
to LRU policy revise.
