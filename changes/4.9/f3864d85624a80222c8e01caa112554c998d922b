coresight-stm: support mmapping channel regions with mmio_addr

CoreSight STM device allows direct mapping of the channel regions to
userspace for zero-copy writing. To support this ability, the STM
framework has provided a hook 'mmio_addr', this patch just implemented
this hook for CoreSight STM.

This patch also added an item into 'channel_space' to save the physical
base address of channel region which mmap operation needs to know.
