sched/deadline: Remove useless parameter from setup_new_dl_entity()

setup_new_dl_entity() takes two parameters, but it only actually uses
one of them, under a different name, to setup a new dl_entity, after:

  2f9f3fdc928 "sched/deadline: Remove dl_new from struct sched_dl_entity"

as we currently do:

  setup_new_dl_entity(&p->dl, &p->dl)

However, before Luca's change we were doing:

  setup_new_dl_entity(dl_se, pi_se)

in update_dl_entity() for a dl_se->new entity: we were using pi_se's
parameters (the potential PI donor) for setting up a new entity.

This change removes the useless second parameter of setup_new_dl_entity().

While we are at it we also optimize things further calling setup_new_dl_
entity() only for already queued tasks, since (as pointed out by Xunlei)
we already do the very same update at tasks wakeup time anyway. By doing
so, we don't need to worry about a potential PI donor anymore, as
rt_mutex_setprio() takes care of that already for us.
