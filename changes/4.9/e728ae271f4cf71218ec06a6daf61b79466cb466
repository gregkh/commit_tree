mei: amthif: fix deadlock in initialization during a reset

The device lock was unnecessary obtained in bus rescan work before the
amthif client search.  That causes incorrect lock ordering and task
hang:
...
[88004.613213] INFO: task kworker/1:14:21832 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
...
[88004.645934] Workqueue: events mei_cl_bus_rescan_work
...

The correct lock order is
 cl_bus_lock
  device_lock
   me_clients_rwsem

Move device_lock into amthif init function that called
after me_clients_rwsem is released.

This fixes regression introduced by commit:
commit 025fb792bac3 ("mei: split amthif client init from end of clients enumeration")
