net/mlx5e: Fix XDP error path of mlx5e_open_channel()

In case of mlx5e_open_rq fails the error handling will jump to
label err_close_xdp_sq and will try to close the xdp_sq unconditionally.
xdp_sq is valid only in case of XDP use cases, i.e priv->xdp_prog is
not null.

To fix this in this patch we test xdp_sq validity prior to closing it.

In addition we now close the xdp_sq.cq as well.
