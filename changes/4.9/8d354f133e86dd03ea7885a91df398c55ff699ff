blk-mq: improve layout of blk_mq_hw_ctx

Various cache line optimizations:

- Move delay_work towards the end. It's huge, and we don't use it
  a lot (only SCSI).

- Move the atomic state into the same cacheline as the the dispatch
  list and lock.

- Rearrange a few members to pack it better.

- Shrink the max-order for dispatch accounting from 10 to 7. This
  means that ->dispatched[] and ->run now take up their own
  cacheline.

This shrinks struct blk_mq_hw_ctx down to 8 cachelines.
