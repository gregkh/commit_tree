NET: usb: cdc_mbim: add quirk for supporting Telit LE922A

Telit LE922A MBIM based composition does not work properly
with altsetting toggle done in cdc_ncm_bind_common.

This patch adds CDC_MBIM_FLAG_AVOID_ALTSETTING_TOGGLE quirk
to avoid this procedure that, instead, is mandatory for
other modems.
