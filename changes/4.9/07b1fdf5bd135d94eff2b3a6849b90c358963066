powerpc: Add simple cache inhibited MMIO accessors

Add simple cache inhibited accessors for memory mapped I/O.
Unlike the accessors built from the DEF_MMIO_* macros, these
don't include any hardware memory barriers, callers need to
manage memory barriers on their own. These can only be called
in hypervisor real mode.
