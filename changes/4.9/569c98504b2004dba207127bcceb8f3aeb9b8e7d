batman-adv: Revert "postpone sysfs removal when unregistering"

Postponing the removal of the interface breaks the expected behavior of
NETDEV_UNREGISTER and NETDEV_PRE_TYPE_CHANGE. This is especially
problematic when an interface is removed and added in quick succession.

This reverts commit 5bc44dc8458c ("batman-adv: postpone sysfs removal when
unregistering").
