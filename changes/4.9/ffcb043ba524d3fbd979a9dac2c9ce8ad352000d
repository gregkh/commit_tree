sched/x86: Fix thread_saved_pc()

thread_saved_pc() was using a completely bogus method to get the return
address.  Since switch_to() was previously inlined, there was no sane way
to know where on the stack the return address was stored.  Now with the
frame of a sleeping thread well defined, this can be implemented correctly.
