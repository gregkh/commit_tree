thermal/powerclamp: correct cpu support check

Initial logic for checking CPU match resulted in OR of CPU features
rather than the intended AND.

Updated to use boot_cpu_has macro rather than x86_match_cpu.

In addition, MWAIT is the only required CPU feature for idle
injection to work.  Drop other feature requirements since they are
only needed for optimal efficiency.
