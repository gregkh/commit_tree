mm: filemap: don't plant shadow entries without radix tree node

When the underflow checks were added to workingset_node_shadow_dec(),
they triggered immediately:

This is a long-standing bug in the way shadow entries are accounted in
the radix tree nodes. The shrinker needs to know when radix tree nodes
contain only shadow entries, no pages, so node->count is split in half
to count shadows in the upper bits and pages in the lower bits.

Unfortunately, the radix tree implementation doesn't know of this and
assumes all entries are in node->count. When there is a shadow entry
directly in root->rnode and the tree is later extended, the radix tree
implementation will copy that entry into the new node and and bump its
node->count, i.e. increases the page count bits. Once the shadow gets
removed and we subtract from the upper counter, node->count underflows
and triggers the warning. Afterwards, without node->count reaching 0
again, the radix tree node is leaked.

Limit shadow entries to when we have actual radix tree nodes and can
count them properly. That means we lose the ability to detect refaults
from files that had only the first page faulted in at eviction time.
