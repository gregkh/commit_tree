dma-buf/sync_file: add sync_file_get_fence()

Creates a function that given an sync file descriptor returns a
fence containing all fences in the sync_file.

v2: Comments by Daniel Vetter
	- Adapt to new version of fence_collection_init()
	- Hold a reference for the fence we return

v3:
	- Adapt to use fput() directly
	- rename to sync_file_get_fence() as we always return one fence

v4: Adapt to use fence_array

v5: set fence through fence_get()
