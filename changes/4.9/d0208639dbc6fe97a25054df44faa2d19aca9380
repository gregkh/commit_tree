s390/dumpstack: restore reliable indicator for call traces

Before merging all different stack tracers the call traces printed had
an indicator if an entry can be considered reliable or not.
Unreliable entries were put in braces, reliable not. Currently all
lines contain these extra braces.

This patch restores the old behaviour by adding an extra "reliable"
parameter to the callback functions. Only show_trace makes currently
use of it.

Before:
[    0.804751] Call Trace:
[    0.804753] ([<000000000017d0e0>] try_to_wake_up+0x318/0x5e0)
[    0.804756] ([<0000000000161d64>] create_worker+0x174/0x1c0)

After:
[    0.804751] Call Trace:
[    0.804753] ([<000000000017d0e0>] try_to_wake_up+0x318/0x5e0)
[    0.804756]  [<0000000000161d64>] create_worker+0x174/0x1c0
