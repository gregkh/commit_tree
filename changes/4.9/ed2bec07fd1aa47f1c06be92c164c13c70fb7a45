documentation: Record reason for rcu_head two-byte alignment

There is an assertion in __call_rcu() that checks only the bottom
bit of the rcu_head pointer, rather than the bottom two (as might be
expected for 32-bit systems) or the bottom three (as might be expected
for 64-bit systems).  This choice might be a bit surprising in these days
of ubiquitous 32-bit and 64-bit systems.  This commit therefore records
the reason for this odd alignment check, namely that m68k guarantees
only two-byte alignment despite being a 32-bit architectures.
