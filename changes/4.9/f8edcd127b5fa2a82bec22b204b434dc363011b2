net: rtnetlink: Don't export empty RTAX_FEATURES

Since the features bit field has bits for internal only use as well, it
may happen that the kernel exports RTAX_FEATURES attribute with zero
value which is pointless.

Fix this by making sure the attribute is added only if the exported
value is non-zero.
