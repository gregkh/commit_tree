drm/i915: Fix nesting of rps.mutex and struct_mutex during powersave init

During intel_gt_powersave_init() we take the RPS mutex to ensure that
all locking requirements are met as we talk to the punit, but we also
require the struct_mutex for allocating a slice of the global GTT for a
power context on Valleyview. struct_mutex must be the outer lock here,
as we nest rps.mutex inside later on.
