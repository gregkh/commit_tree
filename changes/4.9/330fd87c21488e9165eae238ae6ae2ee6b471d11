arm64: dts: hikey: Add hikey support for syscon-reboot-mode

Add support to hikey dts for the syscon-reboot-mode driver.

After trying an approach using a sram driver and node, a number
of issues cropped up which would make it so we would be
duplicating a lot of extra syscon infrastructure in order to
support mfds on sram. After talking with Bjorn, using the
syscon driver for this seems like an better choice.
