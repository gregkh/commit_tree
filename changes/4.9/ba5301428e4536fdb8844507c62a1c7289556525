staging: lustre: lnet: lock improvement for ko2iblnd

kiblnd_check_sends() takes conn::ibc_lock at the begin and release
this lock at the end, this is inefficient because most use-case
needs to explicitly release ibc_lock before caling this function.

This patches changes it to kiblnd_check_sends_locked() and avoid
unnecessary lock dances.
