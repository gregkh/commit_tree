net: stmmac: add a glue driver for the Amlogic Meson 8b / GXBB DWMAC

The Ethernet controller available in Meson8b and GXBB SoCs is a Synopsys
DesignWare MAC IP core which is already supported by the stmmac driver.

In addition to the standard stmmac driver some Meson8b / GXBB specific
registers have to be configured for the PHY clocks. These SoC specific
registers are called PRG_ETHERNET_ADDR0 and PRG_ETHERNET_ADDR1 in the
datasheet.
These registers are not backwards compatible with those on Meson 6b,
which is why a new glue driver is introduced. This worked for many
boards because the bootloader programs the PRG_ETHERNET registers
correctly. Additionally the meson6-dwmac driver only sets bit 1 of
PRG_ETHERNET_ADDR0 which (according to the datasheet) is only used
during reset.

Currently all configuration values can be determined automatically,
based on the configured phy-mode (which is mandatory for the stmmac
driver). If required the tx-delay and the mux clock (so it supports
the MPLL2 clock as well) can be made configurable in the future.
