ARM: dts: sun8i: Add dts file for the Orange Pi Plus2E SBC

The Orange Pi Plus2E is an extended version of the Orange Pi Pc Plus,
with 2G RAM and an external gbit ethernet phy.

Note currently the dts is pretty much empty (except for including the
pc-plus dts), I've a local patch which enables the emac actually making
this dts different from the pc-plus one, but that needs the h3 emac
driver to get merged first.
