arm64/kvm: use alternative auto-nop

Make use of the new alternative_if and alternative_else_nop_endif and
get rid of our open-coded NOP sleds, making the code simpler to read.

Note that for __kvm_call_hyp the branch to __vhe_hyp_call has been moved
out of the alternative sequence, and in the default case there will be
four additional NOPs executed.
