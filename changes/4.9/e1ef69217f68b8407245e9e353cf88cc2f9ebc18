rcutorture: Remove outdated config option description

CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_RUNNABLE was removed by commit 4e9a073f60367
("torture: Remove CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_RUNNABLE, simplify code"),
but the documentation was not updated accordingly.  This commit therefore
updates the documentation to reflect CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_RUNNABLE's
removal and to add a description for the alternative module parameter.
