bnxt_en: Fix a VXLAN vs GENEVE issue

Knowing that:
  #define TUNNEL_DST_PORT_FREE_REQ_TUNNEL_TYPE_VXLAN        (0x1UL << 0)
  #define TUNNEL_DST_PORT_FREE_REQ_TUNNEL_TYPE_GENEVE       (0x5UL << 0)
and that 'bnxt_hwrm_tunnel_dst_port_alloc()' is only called with one of
these 2 constants, the TUNNEL_DST_PORT_ALLOC_REQ_TUNNEL_TYPE_GENEVE can not
trigger.

Replace the bit test that overlap by an equality test, just as in
'bnxt_hwrm_tunnel_dst_port_free()' above.
