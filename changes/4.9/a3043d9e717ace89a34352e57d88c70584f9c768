greybus: arche-platform: reduce wait between WAKE_OUT checks

SVC WAKE_OUT loop is estimated 400ms during which wake_detect line
is pulled low for AP detection.  On AP side we have 500ms delay
between checks.  To avoid timing issues, reduce delay between
checks and raise total # of checks so that overall time for sequence
is the same.

Testing Done:
- Used for DB3.5/EVT1.5 hardware during bringup
- Regression tested on DB3.1+ES2, DB3.1+ES3
