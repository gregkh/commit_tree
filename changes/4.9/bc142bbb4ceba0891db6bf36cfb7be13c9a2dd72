greybus: arche_platform: Remove child's platform device as part of _remove() fn

It seems we need to delete platform_dev of all childs explicitly,
in _remove() fn callback of parent driver.
There were some discussions about having of_platform_unpopulate(),
but it never made it to mainline.

There are some drivers which are removing platform_dev explicitly,
as done in this patch.

Note that, without this, multiple insmod-rmmod won't work, as I see
driver probe gets invoked twice and leads to failure of probe.
