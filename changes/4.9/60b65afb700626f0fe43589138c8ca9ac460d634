staging: lustre: llite: make default_easize writeable in /sysfs

Allow default_easize to be tuned via /sysfs. A system administrator
might want this if a rare access to widely striped files drives up the
value on a filesystem where narrowly striped files are the more common
case. In practice, however, this is wanted primarily to facilitate
a test case for LU-5549.

 - Plumb the necessary interfaces through the LMV and MDC layers
   to expose write access to this value by higher layers.

 - Add block comments to modified functions.
