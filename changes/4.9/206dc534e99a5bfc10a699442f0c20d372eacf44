greybus: tracing: refine comments

I believe that duplicating the tracepoint name in comments prior to
the tracepoint is redundant, and doesn't add a lot of value.

I also believe that we can provide a little more information about
what exactly an event means, or when exactly it is called.

I don't claim this is a huge improvement, but it's a proposal.
