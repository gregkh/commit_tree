[media] dvb_frontend: Use memdup_user() rather than duplicating its implementation

* Reuse existing functionality from memdup_user() instead of keeping
  duplicate source code.

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* Return directly if this copy operation failed.

* Replace the specification of data structures by pointer dereferences
  to make the corresponding size determination a bit safer according to
  the Linux coding style convention.
