IB/mlx4: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

alloc_ordered_workqueue() with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, replaces
deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue(). This is the identity
conversion.

The workqueue "wq" queues work items &dm[i]->work, &ew->work.
It has been identity converted.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure.
