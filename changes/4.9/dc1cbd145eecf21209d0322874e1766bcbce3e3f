batman-adv: Allow to disable debugfs support

The files provided by batman-adv via debugfs are currently converted to
netlink. Tools which are not yet converted to use the netlink interface may
still rely on the old debugfs files. But systems which already upgraded
their tools can save some space by disabling this feature. The default
configuration of batman-adv on amd64 can reduce the size of the module by
around 11% when this feature is disabled.
