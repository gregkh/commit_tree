KVM: s390: fix delivery of vector regs during machine checks

Vector registers are only to be stored if the facility is available
and if the guest has set up the machine check extended save area.

If anything goes wrong while writing the vector registers, the vector
registers are to be marked as invalid. Please note that we are allowed
to write the registers although they are marked as invalid.

Machine checks and "store status" SIGP orders are two different concepts,
let's correctly separate these. As the SIGP part is completely handled in
user space, we can drop it.

This patch is based on a patch from Cornelia Huck.
