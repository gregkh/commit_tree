kbuild: -ffunction-sections fix for archs with conflicting sections

Enabling -ffunction-sections modified the generic linker script to
pull .text.* sections into regular TEXT_TEXT section, conflicting
with some architectures. Revert that change and require archs that
enable the option to ensure they have no conflicting section names,
and do the appropriate merging.
