drm/i915: sseu: Convert subslice count fields to subslice mask

In an upcoming patch we'll need the actual mask of subslices in addition
to their count, so convert the subslice_per_slice field to a mask.
Also we can easily calculate subslice_total from the other fields, so
instead of storing a cached version of this, add a helper to calculate
it.

v2:
- Use hweight8() on u8 typed vars instead of hweight32(). (Ben)
