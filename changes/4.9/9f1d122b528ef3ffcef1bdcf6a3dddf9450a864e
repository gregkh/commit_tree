perf intel-pt: Enable decoder to handle TIP.PGD with missing IP

When address filters are used, the decoder must detect the end of a
filter region (or a branch into a tracestop region) by matching Packet
Generation Disabled (TIP.PGD) packets against the object code using the
IP given in the packet. However, due to errata SKL014 "Intel PT TIP.PGD
May Not Have Target IP Payload", that IP may not be present.

Enable the decoder to handle that by adding a new callback function
'pgd_ip()' which indicates whether the IP is not traced, in which case
that is the point where the trace was disabled.
