gpio: pca953x: Fix corruption of other gpios in set_multiple.

gpiod_set_array_value_complex does not clear the bits field.
Therefore when the drivers set_multiple funciton is called bits outside
the mask are undefined and can be either set or not. So bank_val needs
to be masked with bank_mask before or with the reg_val cache.
