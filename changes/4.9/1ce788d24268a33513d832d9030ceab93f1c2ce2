ahci: qoriq: Revert "ahci: qoriq: Disable NCQ on ls2080a SoC"

This reverts commit 640847298e2b7f19 ("ahci: qoriq: Disable NCQ
on ls2080a SoC")

The erratum has been fixed in ls2080a v2.0 and later soc.
In reality, customer will not get any ls2080a v1.0 soc. Neither apply
to any products. So reverting this commit won't create any side effect.

Blacklisting v2.0 could also be a option, but that needs to check the
soc version which is not suitable in the driver.
