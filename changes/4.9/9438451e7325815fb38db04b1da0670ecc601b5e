qede: mark qede_set_features() static

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qede/qede_main.c:2113:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'qede_set_features' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, this function is only used in the file in which it is
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks this function with 'static'.
