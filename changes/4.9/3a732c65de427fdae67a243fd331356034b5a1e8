iwlwifi: mvm: wake the wait queue when the RX sync counter is zero

When we sync the RX queues the driver waits to receive echo
notification on all the RX queues.
The wait queue is set with timeout until all queues have received
the notification.
However, iwl_mvm_rx_queue_notif() never woke up the wait queue,
with the result of the counter value being checked only when the
timeout expired.
This may cause a latency of up to 1 second.
