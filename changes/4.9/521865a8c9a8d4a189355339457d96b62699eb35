Staging: comedi: s626: Remove all unused functions

Remove all #ifdef'ed static functions as they are not used anywhere
in the kernel. Some functions were detected using Coccinelle but removed by
hand and some were removed as the functions in which they were getting
used were also unused functions.
Script:

@initialize:python@
@@
def display(name,p):
        print(name,p[0].file)

@r1@
identifier func;
type T;
position p;

static T func@p(...)

...
}

@r@

func

@script:python depends on !r@
func << r1.func;
p << r1.p;

display(func,p)
