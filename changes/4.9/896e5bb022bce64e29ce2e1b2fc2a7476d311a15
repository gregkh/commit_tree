drm/i915: Move CRTC updating in atomic_commit into it's own hook

Since we have to write ddb allocations at the same time as we do other
plane updates, we're going to need to be able to control the order in
which we execute modesets on each pipe. The easiest way to do this is to
just factor this section of intel_atomic_commit_tail()
(intel_atomic_commit() for stable branches) into it's own function, and
add an appropriate display function hook for it.

Based off of Matt Rope's suggestions

Changes since v1:
 - Drop pipe_config->base.active check in intel_update_crtcs() since we
   check that before calling the function
