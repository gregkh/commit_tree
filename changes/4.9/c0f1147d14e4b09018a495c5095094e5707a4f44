net/mlx5e: Change the SQ/RQ operational state to positive logic

When using the negative logic (i.e. FLUSH state), after the RQ/SQ reopen
we will have a time interval that the RQ/SQ is not really ready and the
state indicates that its not in FLUSH state because the initial SQ/RQ struct
memory starts as zeros.
Now we changed the state to indicate if the SQ/RQ is opened and we will
set the READY state after finishing preparing all the SQ/RQ resources.
