dmaengine: cppi41: Fix unpaired pm runtime when only a USB hub is connected

On am335x with musb host we can end up with unpaired pm runtime calls
if a hub with no devices is connected and disconnected.

This is because of the conditional pm runtime calls which are always
a bad idea. Let's fix the issue by making them unconditional and
paired in each function.
