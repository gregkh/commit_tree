sched/core: Introduce 'struct sched_domain_shared'

Since struct sched_domain is strictly per cpu; introduce a structure
that is shared between all 'identical' sched_domains.

Limit to SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES domains for now, as we'll only use it
for shared cache state; if another use comes up later we can easily
relax this.

While the sched_group's are normally shared between CPUs, these are
not natural to use when we need some shared state on a domain level --
since that would require the domain to have a parent, which is not a
given.
