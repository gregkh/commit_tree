drm/tilcdc: Write DMA base and ceiling address with single instruction

Write DMA base and ceiling address with a single instruction, if
available. This should make it more unlikely that LCDC would fetch the
DMA addresses in the middle of an update. Having bad combination of
addresses in dma base and ceiling (e.g base > ceiling) can cause
unpredictaple behavior in LCDC.
