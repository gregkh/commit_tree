ASoC: rt5659: Fix incorrect register addresses

According to the datasheets of Realtek ALC5658 (Rev. 0.9)
and ALC5659 (Rev. 0.13), the "IRQ Control 4" register is
located at MX-00BAh while the "IRQ control 5" register is
at MX-00BBh.

There is no "IRQ Control 6" register in the datasheets but
it is supposed to be behind the "IRQ Control 5" register.

So this patch corrects these addresses.
