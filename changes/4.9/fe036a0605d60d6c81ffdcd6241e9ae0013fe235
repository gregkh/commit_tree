powerpc/64/kexec: Fix MMU cleanup on radix

Just using the hash ops won't work anymore since radix will have
NULL in there. Instead create an mmu_cleanup_all() function which
will do the right thing based on the MMU mode.

For Radix, for now I clear UPRT and the PTCR, effectively switching
back to Radix with no partition table setup.

Currently set it to NULL on BookE thought it might be a good idea
to wipe the TLB there (Scott ?)
