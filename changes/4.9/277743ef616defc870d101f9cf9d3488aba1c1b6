PCI: rockchip: Increase the Max Credit update interval

Increase the likelihood of link state to automatically go to L1 and save
some power.

The default credit update interval of 7.5 us results in the rootport
sending UpdateFC-P and UpdateFC-NP packets too often, thus resulting in the
link never going to L1, and always staying in L0/L0s.  The value 24 us was
chosen after some experiments and peeking over the PCIe bus to see that we
do enter L1 substate when there is not enough traffic on the PCIe bus.
