dib0700: fix nec repeat handling

When receiving a nec repeat, ensure the correct scancode is repeated
rather than a random value from the stack.  This removes the need for
the bogus uninitialized_var() and also fixes the warnings:

    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dib0700_core.c: In function ‘dib0700_rc_urb_completion’:
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dib0700_core.c:679: warning: ‘protocol’ may be used uninitialized in this function

[sean addon: So after writing the patch and submitting it, I've bought the
             hardware on ebay. Without this patch you get random scancodes
             on nec repeats, which the patch indeed fixes.]
