regmap: Add missing little endian functions

This with the longer read and write masks allow supporting more
exotic devices. For example a little endian SPI device:

static const struct regmap_config foo_regmap_config = {
	.reg_bits = 16,
	.reg_stride = 4,
	.val_bits = 16,
	.write_flag_mask = 0x8000,
	.reg_format_endian = REGMAP_ENDIAN_LITTLE,
	.val_format_endian = REGMAP_ENDIAN_LITTLE,
	...
};
