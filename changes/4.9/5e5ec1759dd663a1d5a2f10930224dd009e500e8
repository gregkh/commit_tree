scsi: megaraid_sas: fix macro MEGASAS_IS_LOGICAL to avoid regression

This patch will fix regression caused by commit 1e793f6fc0db ("scsi:
megaraid_sas: Fix data integrity failure for JBOD (passthrough)
devices").

The problem was that the MEGASAS_IS_LOGICAL macro did not have braces
and as a result the driver ended up exposing a lot of non-existing SCSI
devices (all SCSI commands to channels 1,2,3 were returned as
SUCCESS-DID_OK by driver).

[mkp: clarified patch description]
