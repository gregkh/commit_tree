extcon: qcom-spmi-misc: Sync the extcon state on interrupt

The driver was changed after submission to use the new style APIs
like extcon_set_state(). Unfortunately, that only sets the state,
and doesn't notify any consumers that the cable state has
changed. Use extcon_set_state_sync() here instead so that we
notify cable consumers of the state change. This fixes USB
host-device role switching on the db8074 platform.
