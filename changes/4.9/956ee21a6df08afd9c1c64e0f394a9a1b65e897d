crypto: ccp - Refactoring: symbol cleanup

Form and use of the local storage block in the CCP is
particular to the device version. Much of the code that
accesses the storage block can treat it as a virtual
resource, and will under go some renaming. Device-specific
access to the memory will be moved into device file.
Service functions will be added to the actions
structure.
