drm: Extract drm_framebuffer.[hc]

Also start with drm_modeset.h with the core bits, since we need
to untangle this mess somehow. That allows us to move the drm_modes.h
include to the right spot, except for the temporary connector status
enum. That will get fixed as soon as drm_connector.h exists.

v2: Rebase.

v3: Move drm_crtc_force_disable_all back again, that wasn't meant to
be moved (Sean).

v4: Rebase.
