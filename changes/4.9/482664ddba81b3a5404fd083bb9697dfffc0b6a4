orangefs: add features op

This is a new userspace operation, which will be done if the client-core
version is greater than or equal to 2.9.6. This will provide a way to
implement optional features and to determine which features are
supported by the client-core. If the client-core version is older than
2.9.6, no optional features are supported and the op will not be done.

The intent is to allow protocol extensions without relying on the
client-core's current behavior of ignoring what it doesn't understand.
