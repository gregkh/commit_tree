greybus: uart: fix typo in defintion

Fixing needless redefinition of operation types in gbsim reveals this typo
GB_UART_TYPE_SET_BREAK -> GB_UART_TYPE_SEND_BREAK. This patch should be
applied in lock-step to the patch to gbsim 'gbsim/uart: remove unnecessary
redefinition of operation types' since gbsim does not contain the typo.
