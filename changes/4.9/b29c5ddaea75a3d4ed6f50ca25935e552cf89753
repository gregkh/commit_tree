gpio: spear-spics: drop unused MODULE_ tags from non-modular code

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/gpio/Kconfig:config GPIO_SPEAR_SPICS
drivers/gpio/Kconfig:   bool "ST SPEAr13xx SPI Chip Select as GPIO support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is now contained at the top of the file in the comments.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.
