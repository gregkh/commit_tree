MIPS: ptrace: Also initialize the FP context on individual FCSR writes

Complement commit ac9ad83bc318 ("MIPS: prevent FP context set via ptrace
being discarded") and also initialize the FP context whenever FCSR alone
is written with a PTRACE_POKEUSR request addressing FPC_CSR, rather than
along with the full FPU register set in the case of the PTRACE_SETFPREGS
request.
