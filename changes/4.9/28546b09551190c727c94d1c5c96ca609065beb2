arm64: dts: apq8016-sbc: Add HDMI display support

The APQ8016-sbc provides a HDMI output. The APQ8016 display block only
provides a MIPI DSI output. So, the board has a ADV7533 DSI to HDMI
encoder chip that sits between the DSI PHY output and the HDMI
connector.

Add the ADV7533 DT node under its I2C control bus, and tie the DSI
output port to the ADV7533's input port.
