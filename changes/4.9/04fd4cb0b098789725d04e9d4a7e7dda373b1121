HID: alps: fix stick device not working after resume

The stick device does not work after resume, add U1_SP_ABS_MODE flag can
make the device work after resume.

This has been discovered by pure guesswork, based on how the existing code uses
U1_TP_ABS_MODE flag on both initialization and resume.

I also tested the the patch on an ALPS touchpad without stick device, did not
notice any side effect on suspend/resume, so I made the U1_SP_ABS_MODE flag
mandatory.
