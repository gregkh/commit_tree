ipv6: add mtu lock check in __ip6_rt_update_pmtu

Prior to this patch, ipv6 didn't do mtu lock check in ip6_update_pmtu.
It leaded to that mtu lock doesn't really work when receiving the pkt
of ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG.

This patch is to add mtu lock check in __ip6_rt_update_pmtu just as ipv4
did in __ip_rt_update_pmtu.
