netfilter: nft_hash: Add hash offset value

Add support to pass through an offset to the hash value. With this
feature, the sysadmin is able to generate a hash with a given
offset value.

Example:

	meta mark set jhash ip saddr mod 2 seed 0xabcd offset 100

This option generates marks according to the source address from 100 to
101.
