ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix to turn off hdmi power on probe failure

HDMI codec is required to be powered up before controller initialization
for successful enumeration of codec. If the probe fails it needs to be
powered off to balance the power state of HDMI codec.

This fix balances the reference count in the error path before turning
off the codec.
