drm/i915: Count how many VMA are bound for an object

Since we may have VMA allocated for an object, but we interrupted their
binding, there is a disparity between have elements on the obj->vma_list
and being bound. i915_gem_obj_bound_any() does this check, but this is
not rigorously observed - add an explicit count to make it easier.
