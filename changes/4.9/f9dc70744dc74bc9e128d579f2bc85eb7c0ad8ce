net/xgene: fix error handling during reset

The newly added reset logic uses helper functions for the MMIO that
may fail. However, when the read operation fails, we end up writing
back uninitialized data to the register, as gcc warns:

drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_xgmac.c: In function 'xgene_enet_link_state':
drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_xgmac.c:213:2: error: 'data' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_xgmac.c:209:6: note: 'data' was declared here
  u32 data;

We already print a warning to the console log if that happens,
the best alternative that I can see is skip the rest of the reset
sequence if the register value cannot be read: Most likely the
write would fail as well, and if it succeeded, worse things could
happen.
