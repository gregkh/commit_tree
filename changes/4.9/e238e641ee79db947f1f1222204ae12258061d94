greybus: kill the last gbuf remnants

All the code has now been adjusted such that we can do away with the
old gbuf structure.

Three unused references remained in "greybus.h", so those are deleted.

Other than that most of the changes were done by simple global
substitution.  The gb_message structure incorporates the fields that
were previously found its embedded gbuf structure.  A few names have
been changed in the process:
    gbuf->transfer_buffer       message->buffer
    gbuf->transfer_buffer_size  message->buffer_size
    gbuf->hcd_data;             message->cookie
