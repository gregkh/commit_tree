iommu/arm-smmu: Set PRIVCFG in stage 1 STEs

Implement the SMMUv3 equivalent of d346180e70b9 ("iommu/arm-smmu: Treat
all device transactions as unprivileged"), so that once again those
pesky DMA controllers with their privileged instruction fetches don't
unexpectedly fault in stage 1 domains due to VMSAv8 rules.
