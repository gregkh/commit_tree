ASoC: samsung: get access to DMA engine early to defer probe properly

ASoC Samsung sub-drivers tried to get access to their DMA engine
controllers as a last step in driver probe. If a DMA engine was not
available yet, samsung_asoc_dma_platform_register() function ended in
-EPROBE_DEFER, but the driver already registered its component to ASoC
core. This patch moves samsung_asoc_dma_platform_register() call before
registering any components, to the common place, where driver was gathering
all needed resources.

In case of Samsung Exynos i2s driver the issue was even worse. The driver
managed already to register its secondary DAI platform device before
even getting the DMA engine access. That together with -EPROBE_DEFER error
code from samsung_i2s_probe() immediately triggered another round of
deferred probe retry and in turn endless loop of driver probing.

This patch fixes broken boot on Odroid XU3 and other Exynos5422-based
boards.
