s390/pci_dma: remove dma address range check

We calculate dma addresses using an iommu bitmap. Since commit
69eea95c ("s390/pci_dma: fix DMA table corruption with > 4 TB main memory")
we've made sure that addresses created using that bitmap are below
the maximum reported by firmware. Thus the additional check for
that address to be within range can be removed.
