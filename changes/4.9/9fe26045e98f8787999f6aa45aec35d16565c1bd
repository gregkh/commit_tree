xfs: add clone file and clone range vfs functions

Define two VFS functions which allow userspace to reflink a range of
blocks between two files or to reflink one file's contents to another.
These functions fit the new VFS ioctls that standardize the checking
for the btrfs CLONE and CLONE RANGE ioctls.
