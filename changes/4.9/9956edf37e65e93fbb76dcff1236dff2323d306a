shmem: fix pageflags after swapping DMA32 object

If shmem_alloc_page() does not set PageLocked and PageSwapBacked, then
shmem_replace_page() needs to do so for itself.  Without this, it puts
newpage on the wrong lru, re-unlocks the unlocked newpage, and system
descends into "Bad page" reports and freeze; or if CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y, it
hits an earlier VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!PageLocked), depending on config.

But shmem_replace_page() is not a common path: it's only called when
swapin (or swapoff) finds the page was already read into an unsuitable
zone: usually all zones are suitable, but gem objects for a few drm
devices (gma500, omapdrm, crestline, broadwater) require zone DMA32 if
there's more than 4GB of ram.
