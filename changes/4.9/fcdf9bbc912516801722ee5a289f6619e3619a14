[media] media: platform: pxa_camera: change stop_streaming semantics

Instead of the legacy behavior where it was required to wait for all
video buffers to be finished by the hardware, use a cancel like strategy
: as soon as the stop_streaming() call is done, abort all DMA transfers,
report the already buffers as failed and return.

This makes stop_streaming() more a "cancel capture" than a "wait for end
of capture" semantic.
