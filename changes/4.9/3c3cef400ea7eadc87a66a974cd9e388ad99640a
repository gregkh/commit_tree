greybus: move the definition of struct gbuf

We no longer need struct gbuf defined in "greybus.h".  An upcoming
patch will embed a gbuf struct (not a pointer) into the operation
structure, and to do that we'll need the struct defined prior to the
operation.  Just move the gbuf definition into "operation.h".
