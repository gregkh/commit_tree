netfilter: replace list_head with single linked list

The netfilter hook list never uses the prev pointer, and so can be trimmed to
be a simple singly-linked list.

In addition to having a more light weight structure for hook traversal,
struct net becomes 5568 bytes (down from 6400) and struct net_device becomes
2176 bytes (down from 2240).
