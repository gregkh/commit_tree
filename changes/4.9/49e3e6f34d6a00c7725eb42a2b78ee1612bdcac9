net: hip04: mark tx_done() static

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hip04_eth.c:603:22: warning: no previous prototype for 'tx_done' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, this function is only used in the file in which it is
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks this function with 'static'.
