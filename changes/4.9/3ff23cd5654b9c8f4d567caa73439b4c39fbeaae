mac80211: Set lower memory limit for non-VHT devices

Small devices can run out of memory from queueing too many packets. If
VHT is not supported by the PHY, having more than 4 MBytes of total
queue in the TXQ intermediate queues is not needed, and so we can safely
limit the memory usage in these cases and avoid OOM.
