sched/core: Restructure destroy_sched_domain()

There is no point in doing a call_rcu() for each domain, only do a
callback for the root sched domain and clean up the entire set in one
go.

Also make the entire call chain be called destroy_sched_domain*() to
remove confusion with the free_sched_domains() call, which does an
entirely different thing.

Both cpu_attach_domain() callers of destroy_sched_domain() can live
without the call_rcu() because at those points the sched_domain hasn't
been published yet.
