drm/i915: Remove forced stop ring on suspend/unload

Before suspending (or unloading), we would first wait upon all rendering
to be completed and then disable the rings. This later step is a remanent
from DRI1 days when we did not use request tracking for all operations
upon the ring. Now that we are sure we are waiting upon the very last
operation by the engine, we can forgo clobbering the ring registers,
though we do keep the assert that the engine is indeed idle before
sleeping.
