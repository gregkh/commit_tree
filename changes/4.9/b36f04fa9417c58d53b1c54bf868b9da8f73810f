greybus: loopback: Convert thread delay to microseconds

Currently the loopback code allows a delay between operations specified in
milliseconds. Having added asynchronous bi-directional support to loopback
its obvious that the delay value would be far more useful specified in
microseconds than milliseconds. So, this patch makes the necessary
conversion.
