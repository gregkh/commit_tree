dm: use signal_pending_state() in dm_wait_for_completion()

Use signal_pending_state() instead of open-coding it.  This patch does
not change any functionality but makes it possible to pass TASK_KILLABLE
as the second argument of dm_wait_for_completion().  See also commit
16882c1e962b ("sched: fix TASK_WAKEKILL vs SIGKILL race").
