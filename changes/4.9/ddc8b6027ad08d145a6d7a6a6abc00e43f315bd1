netfilter: introduce nft_set_pktinfo_{ipv4, ipv6}_validate()

These functions are extracted from the netdev family, they initialize
the pktinfo structure and validate that the IPv4 and IPv6 headers are
well-formed given that these functions are called from a path where
layer 3 sanitization did not happen yet.

These functions are placed in include/net/netfilter/nf_tables_ipv{4,6}.h
so they can be reused by a follow up patch to use them from the bridge
family too.
