staging: fsl-mc: make bus/mc-bus explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config FSL_MC_BUS
        bool "Freescale Management Complex (MC) bus driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since the code was already not using module_init, we don't have to change
the initcall and the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file does make some
references to "struct *module" for processing other modules.
