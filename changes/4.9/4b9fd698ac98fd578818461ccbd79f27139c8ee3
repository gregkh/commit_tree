staging: media: bcm2048: Merge assignment with return

Instead of storing the return value into a variable and then returning it, we
can club the two into a single return statement. This change was made using
the following semantic patch by Coccinelle:

@@
local idexpression ret;
expression e;
@@

-ret =
+return
     e;
-return ret;
