drm/i915: Don't try to ack sink irqs when there are none

My ASUS PB278 at least doesn't seem to appreciate when you try to
ack sink irqs when there are none. Results in this sort of dmesg spam
[drm:drm_dp_dpcd_access] too many retries, giving up

Let's skip the ack if there are no pending irqs. I have no clue why we
do this in two places. One of them likely should just go away. Oh, and
MST has its own sink irq handler too...
