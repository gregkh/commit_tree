batman-adv: Handle parent interfaces in a different netns

batman-adv tries to prevent the user from placing a batX soft
interface into another batman mesh as a hard interface. It does this
by walking up the devices list of parents and ensures they are all
none batX interfaces. iflink can point to an interface in a different
namespace, so also retrieve the parents name space when finding the
parent and use it when doing the comparison.
