igb: support RX flow classification by ethertype

This patch is meant to allow for RX network flow classification to insert
and remove ethertype filter by ethtool

Example:
Add an ethertype filter:
$ ethtool -N eth0 flow-type ether proto 0x88F8 action 2

Show all filters:
$ ethtool -n eth0
4 RX rings available
Total 1 rules

Filter: 15
	Flow Type: Raw Ethernet
	Src MAC addr: 00:00:00:00:00:00 mask: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
	Dest MAC addr: 00:00:00:00:00:00 mask: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
	Ethertype: 0x88F8 mask: 0x0
	Action: Direct to queue 2

Delete the filter by location:
$ ethtool -N delete 15
