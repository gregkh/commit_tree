function_graph: Handle TRACE_BPUTS in print_graph_comment

It missed to handle TRACE_BPUTS so messages recorded by trace_bputs()
will be shown with symbol info unnecessarily.

You can see it with the trace_printk sample code:

  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
  # echo sys_sync > set_graph_function
  # echo 1 > options/sym-offset
  # echo function_graph > current_tracer

Note that the sys_sync filter was there to prevent recording other
functions and the sym-offset option was needed since the first message
was called from a module init function so kallsyms doesn't have the
symbol and omitted in the output.

  # cd ~/build/kernel
  # insmod samples/trace_printk/trace-printk.ko

  # cd -
  # head trace

Before:

  # tracer: function_graph
  #
  # CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
  # |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
   1)               |  /* 0xffffffffa0002000: This is a static string that will use trace_bputs */
   1)               |  /* This is a dynamic string that will use trace_puts */
   1)               |  /* trace_printk_irq_work+0x5/0x7b [trace_printk]: (irq) This is a static string that will use trace_bputs */
   1)               |  /* (irq) This is a dynamic string that will use trace_puts */
   1)               |  /* (irq) This is a static string that will use trace_bprintk() */
   1)               |  /* (irq) This is a dynamic string that will use trace_printk */

After:

  # tracer: function_graph
  #
  # CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
  # |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
   1)               |  /* This is a static string that will use trace_bputs */
   1)               |  /* This is a dynamic string that will use trace_puts */
   1)               |  /* (irq) This is a static string that will use trace_bputs */
   1)               |  /* (irq) This is a dynamic string that will use trace_puts */
   1)               |  /* (irq) This is a static string that will use trace_bprintk() */
   1)               |  /* (irq) This is a dynamic string that will use trace_printk */
