greybus: interface: prevent reactivation during removal

Make sure to prevent an interface that is going away from being
reactivated.

This is needed to preemptively close a race between the upcoming feature
to reactivate a powered-down interface and physical removal (i.e.
module_removed event processing) as well as logical removal (e.g. the
current system-suspend hack).
