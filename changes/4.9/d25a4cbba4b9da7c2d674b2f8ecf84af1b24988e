drm/bridge: adv7511: add support for the 2nd chip

The Renesas Wheat board has 2 ADV7513 chips on the same I2C bus, however
the ADV751x driver only supports 1 chip as it tries to assign the packet/
EDID/CEC memory I2C devices to the fixed I2C addresses. Assign these I2C
addresses at the fixed offsets (derived from the programming guide) from
the main register map address instead.
