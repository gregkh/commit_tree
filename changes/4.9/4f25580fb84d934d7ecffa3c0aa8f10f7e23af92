mmc: core: changes frequency to hs_max_dtr when selecting hs400es

Per JESD84-B51 P49, Host need to change frequency to <=52MHz
after setting HS_TIMING to 0x1, and host may changes frequency
to <= 200MHz after setting HS_TIMING to 0x3. That means the card
expects the clock rate to increase from the current used f_init
(which is less than 400KHz, but still being less than 52MHz) to
52MHz, otherwise we find some eMMC devices significantly report
failure when sending status.
