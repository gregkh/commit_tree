greybus: hook up greybus to the driver model

This patch hooks up modules, interfaces, and connections to the driver
model.  Now we have a correct hierarchy, and drivers can be correctly
bound to the proper portions in the future.  Devices are correctly
reference counted and torn down in the proper order on removal of a
module.

Some basic sysfs attributes have been created for interfaces and
connections.  Module attributes are not working properly, but that will
be fixed in future changes.

This has been tested on Alex's machine, with multiple hotplug and unplug
operations of a module working correctly.
