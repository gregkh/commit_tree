pinctrl: sirf: make core support explicitly non-modular

The Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is:

  drivers/pinctrl/sirf/pinctrl-sirf.o
      --> drivers/pinctrl/sirf/Makefile:obj-y += pinctrl-sirf.o

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
