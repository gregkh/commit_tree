drm/imx: ipuv3-plane: disable local alpha for planes without alpha channel

Without this patch, after enabling the overlay plane with an RGBA
framebuffer, switching to a framebuffer without alpha channel would
cause the plane to vanish, since the pixel local alpha is constant
zero in that case. Disable local alpha again when setting an opaque
framebuffer.
