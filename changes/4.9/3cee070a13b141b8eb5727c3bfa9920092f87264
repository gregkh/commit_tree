powerpc: Return the new MSR from msr_check_and_set()

msr_check_and_set() always performs a mfmsr() to determine if it needs
to perform an mtmsr(), as mfmsr() can be a costly operation
msr_check_and_set() could return the MSR now on the CPU to avoid
callers of msr_check_and_set having to make their own mfmsr() call.
