tty: serial_core: Fix serial console crash on port shutdown

The port->console flag is always false, as uart_console() is called
before the serial console has been registered.

Hence for a serial port used as the console, uart_tty_port_shutdown()
will still be called when userspace closes the port, powering it down.
This may lead to a system lock up when the serial console driver writes
to the serial port's registers.

To fix this, move the setting of port->console after the call to
uart_configure_port(), which registers the serial console.
