ahci: only try to use multi-MSI mode if there is more than 1 port

We should only try to allocate multiple MSI or MSI-X vectors if the device
actually has multiple ports.  Otherwise pci_alloc_irq_vectors will return
a single vector due to n_ports = 1, in which case we shouldn't set the
AHCI_HFLAG_MULTI_MSI flag.
