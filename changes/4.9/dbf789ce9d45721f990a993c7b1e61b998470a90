staging: lustre: llite: allow setting stripes to specify OSTs

Extend the llite layer to support specifying individual target
OSTs. Support specifying OSTs for regular files only. Directory
support will be implemented later in a separate project. With
this a file could have for example a OST index layout of
2,4,5,9,11. In addition, duplicate indices will be eliminated
automatically. Calculate the max easize by ld_active_tgt_count
instead of ld_tgt_count. However this may introduce problems
when the OSTs are in recovery because non sufficient buffer
may be allocated to store EA.
