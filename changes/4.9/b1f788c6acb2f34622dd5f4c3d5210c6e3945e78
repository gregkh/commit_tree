drm/i915: Release vma when the handle is closed

In order to prevent a leak of the vma on shared objects, we need to
hook into the object_close callback to destroy the vma on the object for
this file. However, if we destroyed that vma immediately we may cause
unexpected application stalls as we try to unbind a busy vma - hence we
defer the unbind to when we retire the vma.

v2: Keep vma allocated until closed. This is useful for a later
optimisation, but it is required now in order to handle potential
recursion of i915_vma_unbind() by retiring itself.
v3: Comments are important.
