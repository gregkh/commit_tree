x86/mce/AMD, EDAC/mce_amd: Define and use tables for known SMCA IP types

Scalable MCA defines a number of IP types. An MCA bank on an SMCA
system is defined as one of these IP types. A bank's type is uniquely
identified by the combination of the HWID and MCATYPE values read from
its MCA_IPID register.

Add the required tables in order to be able to lookup error descriptions
based on a bank's type and the error's extended error code.

[ bp: Align comments, simplify a bit. ]
