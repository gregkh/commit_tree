staging: ks7010: fix wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout return handling

wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout return 0 on timeout and
-ERESTARTSYS if interrupted. The check for
!wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() would report an interrupt
as timeout. Further, while HZ/50 will work most of the time it could
fail for HZ < 50, so this is switched to msecs_to_jiffies(20).
