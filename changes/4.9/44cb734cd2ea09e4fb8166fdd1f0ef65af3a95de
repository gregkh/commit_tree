drm/i915: Merge the PPS register definitions

The PPS registers are pretty much the same everywhere, the differences
being:
- Register fields appearing, disappearing from one platform to the
  next: panel-reset-on-powerdown, backlight-on, panel-port,
  register-unlock
- Different register base addresses
- Different number of PPS instances: 2 on VLV/CHV/BXT, 1 everywhere
  else.

We can merge the separate set of PPS definitions by extending the PPS
instance argument to all platforms and using instance 0 on platforms
with a single instance. This means we'll need to calculate the register
addresses dynamically based on the given platform and PPS instance.

v2:
- Simplify if ladder in intel_pps_get_registers(). (Ville)
