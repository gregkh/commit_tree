PCI: pciehp: Make explicitly non-modular

This code is not being built as a module by anyone:

  obj-$(CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE)          += pciehp.o
  pciehp-objs                             := pciehp_core.o   \

  drivers/pci/pcie/Kconfig:config HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE
  drivers/pci/pcie/Kconfig:  bool "PCI Express Hotplug driver"

Remove uses of MODULE_DESCRIPTION(), MODULE_AUTHOR(), MODULE_LICENSE(),
etc., so that when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.
The information is preserved in comments at the top of the file.

Note that for non-modular code, module_init() translates to
device_initcall().  One could argue that we should use subsys_initcall()
here, but for now we stick with runtime equivalence.

We delete module.h but we keep the moduleparam.h include, since we are
keeping the module_param() that the file has as-is for now.
