greybus: loopback: Ensure we reset stats once and once only

9445c54c ('greybus/loopback: drop bus aggregate calculation') removed the
aggregation of data in-kernel but instead of dropping the reset of
aggregate stastics, converted that reset into a second reset of the
connection-level stats. While this doesn't result in anything bad it's
also definitely a dumb thing to be doing, so, drop it now.

Also ensure we reset the bridge-specific tracking variables at least once.
