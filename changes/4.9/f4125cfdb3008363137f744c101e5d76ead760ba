parisc: Avoid trashing sr2 and sr3 in LWS code

There is no need to trash sr2 and sr3 in the Light-weight syscall (LWS).  sr2
already points to kernel space (it's zero in userspace, otherwise syscalls
wouldn't work), and since the LWS code is executed in userspace, we can simply
ignore to preload sr3.
