platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Add LID and BATTERY to default mask

After 'platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Use EC_HOST_EVENT_MASK not BIT'
some of the flags are not quite correct.
LID_CLOSED is used to suspend the device, so it makes sense to ignore that.
BATTERY events are also frequent and causing spurious wakes on elm/hana
mt8173 devices.
