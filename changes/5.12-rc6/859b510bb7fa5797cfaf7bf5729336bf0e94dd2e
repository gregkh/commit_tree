HID: chicony: Add Wireless Radio Control feature for Chicony devices

Some Chicony's keyboards support airplane mode hotkey (Fn+F2) with
"Wireless Radio Control" feature. For example, the wireless keyboard
[04f2:1236] shipped with ASUS all-in-one desktop.

After consulting Chicony for this hotkey, learned the device will send
with 0x11 as the report ID and 0x1 as the value when the key is pressed
down.

This patch maps the event as KEY_RFKILL.
