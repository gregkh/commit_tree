io_uring: fix sqpoll cancellation via task_work

Running sqpoll cancellations via task_work_run() is a bad idea because
it depends on other task works to be run, but those may be locked in
currently running task_work_run() because of how it's (splicing the list
in batches).

Enqueue and run them through a separate callback head, namely
struct io_sq_data::park_task_work. As a nice bonus we now precisely
control where it's run, that's much safer than guessing where it can
happen as it was before.
