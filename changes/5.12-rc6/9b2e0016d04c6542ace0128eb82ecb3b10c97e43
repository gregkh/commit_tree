bvec/iter: disallow zero-length segment bvecs

zero-length bvec segments are allowed in general, but not handled by bio
and down the block layer so filtered out. This inconsistency may be
confusing and prevent from optimisations. As zero-length segments are
useless and places that were generating them are patched, declare them
not allowed.
