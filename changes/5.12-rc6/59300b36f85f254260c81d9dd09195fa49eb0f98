ftrace: Check if pages were allocated before calling free_pages()

It is possible that on error pg->size can be zero when getting its order,
which would return a -1 value. It is dangerous to pass in an order of -1
to free_pages(). Check if order is greater than or equal to zero before
calling free_pages().
