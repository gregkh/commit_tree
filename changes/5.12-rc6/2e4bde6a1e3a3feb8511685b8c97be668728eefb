kasan: add compiler barriers to KUNIT_EXPECT_KASAN_FAIL

It might not be obvious to the compiler that the expression must be
executed between writing and reading to fail_data. In this case, the
compiler might reorder or optimize away some of the accesses, and
the tests will fail.

Add compiler barriers around the expression in KUNIT_EXPECT_KASAN_FAIL
and use READ/WRITE_ONCE() for accessing fail_data fields.
