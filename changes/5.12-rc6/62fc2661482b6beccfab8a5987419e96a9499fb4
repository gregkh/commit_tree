scsi: ibmvfc: Make ibmvfc_wait_for_ops() MQ aware

During MQ enablement of the ibmvfc driver ibmvfc_wait_for_ops() was
missed. This function is responsible for waiting on commands to complete
that match a certain criteria such as LUN or cancel key. The implementation
as is only scans the CRQ for events ignoring any sub-queues and as a result
will exit successfully without doing anything when operating in MQ
channelized mode.

Check the MQ and channel use flags to determine which queues are
applicable, and scan each queue accordingly. Note in MQ mode SCSI commands
are only issued down sub-queues and the CRQ is only used for driver
specific management commands. As such the CRQ events are ignored when
operating in MQ mode with channels.
