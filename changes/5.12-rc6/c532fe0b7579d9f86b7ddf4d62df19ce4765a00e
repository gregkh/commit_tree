media: sh_vou: Drop bogus __refdata annotation

Since commit 4c62e9764ab403d4 ("Drivers: media: remove __dev*
attributes.") in v3.8, the SuperH Video Output Unit driver no longer has
any code or data located in initmem, hence there is no need to annotate
the sh_vou structure with __refdata.  Drop the annotation, to avoid
suppressing future section warnings.
