kbuild: Fix ld-version.sh script if LLD was built with LLD_VENDOR

If LLD was built with -DLLD_VENDOR="xyz", ld.lld --version output
will prefix LLD_VENDOR. Since LLD_VENDOR can contain spaces, the
LLD identifier isn't guaranteed to be $2 either.

Adjust the version checker to handle such versions of lld.
