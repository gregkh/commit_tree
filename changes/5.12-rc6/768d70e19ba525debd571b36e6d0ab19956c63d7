powerpc/pseries/dlpar: handle ibm, configure-connector delay status

dlpar_configure_connector() has two problems in its handling of
ibm,configure-connector's return status:

1. When the status is -2 (busy, call again), we call
   ibm,configure-connector again immediately without checking whether
   to schedule, which can result in monopolizing the CPU.
2. Extended delay status (9900..9905) goes completely unhandled,
   causing the configuration to unnecessarily terminate.

Fix both of these issues by using rtas_busy_delay().
