dt-binding: net: ti: k3-am654-cpsw-nuss: update bindings for am64x cpsw3g

Update DT binding for recently introduced TI K3 AM642x SoC [1] which
contains 3 port (2 external ports) CPSW3g module. The CPSW3g integrated
in MAIN domain and can be configured in multi port or switch modes.

The overall functionality and DT bindings are similar to other K3 CPSWxg
versions, so DT binding changes are minimal:
 - reword description
 - add new compatible 'ti,am642-cpsw-nuss'
 - allow 2 external ports child nodes
 - add missed 'assigned-clock' props
