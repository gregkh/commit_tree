bpf: Simplify alu_limit masking for pointer arithmetic

Instead of having the mov32 with aux->alu_limit - 1 immediate, move this
operation to retrieve_ptr_limit() instead to simplify the logic and to
allow for subsequent sanity boundary checks inside retrieve_ptr_limit().
This avoids in future that at the time of the verifier masking rewrite
we'd run into an underflow which would not sign extend due to the nature
of mov32 instruction.
