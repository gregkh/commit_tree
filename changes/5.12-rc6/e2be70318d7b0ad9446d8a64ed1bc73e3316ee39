spi: orion: enable clocks before spi_setup

The spi-orion driver disables its clocks whenever it is not used.
In usual case during boot (i.e. using SPI flash) it is not a problem,
as the child device driver is present and probed along with
spi_register_master() execution.

However in case the child device driver is not ready
(e.g. when its type is module_spi_driver) the spi_setup() callback
can be called after the spi-orion probe. It may happen,
that as a result there will be an attempt to access controller's
registers with the clocks disabled.

Prevent such situations and make sure the clocks are on,
each time the spi_setup() is called.
