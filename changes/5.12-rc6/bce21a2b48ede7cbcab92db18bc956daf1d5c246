Xen/gnttab: introduce common INVALID_GRANT_{HANDLE,REF}

It's not helpful if every driver has to cook its own. Generalize
xenbus'es INVALID_GRANT_HANDLE and pcifront's INVALID_GRANT_REF (which
shouldn't have expanded to zero to begin with). Use the constants in
p2m.c and gntdev.c right away, and update field types where necessary so
they would match with the constants' types (albeit without touching
struct ioctl_gntdev_grant_ref's ref field, as that's part of the public
interface of the kernel and would require introducing a dependency on
Xen's grant_table.h public header).
