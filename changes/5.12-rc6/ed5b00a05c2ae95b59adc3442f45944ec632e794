powerpc/prom: Fix "ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support" scan

The "ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support" property is a list of pairs of
bytes representing the options and values supported by the platform
firmware. At boot time, Linux scans this list and activates the
available features it recognizes : Radix and XIVE.

A recent change modified the number of entries to loop on and 8 bytes,
4 pairs of { options, values } entries are always scanned. This is
fine on KVM but not on PowerVM which can advertises less. As a
consequence on this platform, Linux reads extra entries pointing to
random data, interprets these as available features and tries to
activate them, leading to a firmware crash in
ibm,client-architecture-support.

Fix that by using the property length of "ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support".
