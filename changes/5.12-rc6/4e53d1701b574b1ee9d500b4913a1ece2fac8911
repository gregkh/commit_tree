tomoyo: don't special case PF_IO_WORKER for PF_KTHREAD

Since commit 3bfe6106693b6b4b ("io-wq: fork worker threads from original
task") stopped using PF_KTHREAD flag for the io_uring PF_IO_WORKER threads,
tomoyo_kernel_service() no longer needs to check PF_IO_WORKER flag.

(This is a 5.12+ patch. Please don't send to stable kernels.)
