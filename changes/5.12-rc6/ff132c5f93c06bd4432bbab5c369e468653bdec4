gfs2: report "already frozen/thawed" errors

Before this patch, gfs2's freeze function failed to report an error
when the target file system was already frozen as it should (and as
generic vfs function freeze_super does. Similarly, gfs2's thaw function
failed to report an error when trying to thaw a file system that is not
frozen, as vfs function thaw_super does. The errors were checked, but
it always returned a 0 return code.

This patch adds the missing error return codes to gfs2 freeze and thaw.
