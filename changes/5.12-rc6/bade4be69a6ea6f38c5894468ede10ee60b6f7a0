svcrdma: Revert "svcrdma: Reduce Receive doorbell rate"

I tested commit 43042b90cae1 ("svcrdma: Reduce Receive doorbell
rate") with mlx4 (IB) and software iWARP and didn't find any
issues. However, I recently got my hardware iWARP setup back on
line (FastLinQ) and it's crashing hard on this commit (confirmed
via bisect).

The failure mode is complex.
 - After a connection is established, the first Receive completes
   normally.
 - But the second and third Receives have garbage in their Receive
   buffers. The server responds with ERR_VERS as a result.
 - When the client tears down the connection to retry, a couple
   of posted Receives flush twice, and that corrupts the recv_ctxt
   free list.
 - __svc_rdma_free then faults or loops infinitely while destroying
   the xprt's recv_ctxts.

Since 43042b90cae1 ("svcrdma: Reduce Receive doorbell rate") does
not fix a bug but is a scalability enhancement, it's safe and
appropriate to revert it while working on a replacement.
