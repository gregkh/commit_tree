r8152: adjust the flow of power cut for RTL8153B

For runtime resuming, the RTL8153B may be resumed from the state
of power cut, when enabling the feature of UPS. Then, the PHY
would be reset, so it is necessary to be initailized again.

Besides, the USB_U1U2_TIMER also has to be set again, so I move
it from r8153b_init() to r8153b_hw_phy_cfg().
