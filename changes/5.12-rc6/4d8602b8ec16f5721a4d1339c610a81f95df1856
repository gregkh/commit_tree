drm/vc4: hdmi: Restore cec physical address on reconnect

Currently we call cec_phys_addr_invalidate on a hotplug deassert.
That may be due to a TV power cycling, or an AVR being switched
on (and switching edid).

This makes CEC unusable since our controller wouldn't have a physical
address anymore.

Set it back up again on the hotplug assert.
