powerpc/uaccess: get rid of small constant size cases in raw_copy_{to,from}_user()

Copied from commit 4b842e4e25b1 ("x86: get rid of small
constant size cases in raw_copy_{to,from}_user()")

Very few call sites where that would be triggered remain, and none
of those is anywhere near hot enough to bother.
