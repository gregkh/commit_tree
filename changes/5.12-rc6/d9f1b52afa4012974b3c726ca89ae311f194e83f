arm64: improve whitespace

In a few places we don't have whitespace between macro parameters,
which makes them hard to read. This patch adds whitespace to clearly

In a few places we have unnecessary whitespace around unary operators,
which is confusing, This patch removes the unnecessary whitespace.
