KVM: x86: hyper-v: Limit guest to writing zero to HV_X64_MSR_TSC_EMULATION_STATUS

HV_X64_MSR_TSC_EMULATION_STATUS indicates whether TSC accesses are emulated
after migration (to accommodate for a different host TSC frequency when TSC
scaling is not supported; we don't implement this in KVM). Guest can use
the same MSR to stop TSC access emulation by writing zero. Writing anything
else is forbidden.
