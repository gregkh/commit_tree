KVM: arm64: Fix constant-pool users in hyp

Hyp code uses absolute addressing to obtain a kimg VA of a small number
of kernel symbols. Since the kernel now converts constant pool addresses
to hyp VAs, this trick does not work anymore.

Change the helpers to convert from hyp VA back to kimg VA or PA, as
needed and rework the callers accordingly.
