kbuild: Do not clean resolve_btfids if the output does not exist

Nathan reported issue with cleaning empty build directory:

  $ make -s O=build distclean
  ../../scripts/Makefile.include:4: *** \
  O=/ho...build/tools/bpf/resolve_btfids does not exist.  Stop.

The problem that tools scripts require existing output
directory, otherwise it fails.

Adding check around the resolve_btfids clean target to
ensure the output directory is in place.
