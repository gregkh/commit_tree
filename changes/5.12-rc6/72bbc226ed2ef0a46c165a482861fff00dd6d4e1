s390/vdso: copy tod_steering_delta value to vdso_data page

When converting the vdso assembler code to C it was forgotten to
actually copy the tod_steering_delta value to vdso_data page.

Which in turn means that tod clock steering will not work correctly.

Fix this by simply copying the value whenever it is updated.
