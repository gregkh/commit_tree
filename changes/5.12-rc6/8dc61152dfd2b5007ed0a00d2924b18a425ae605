mfd: iqs62x: Remove superfluous whitespace above fallthroughs

Previously, all instances of the /* fall through */ comment were
preceded by a newline to improve readability.

Now that /* fall through */ comments have been replaced with the
fallthrough pseudo-keyword, the leftover whitespace looks out of
place and can simply be removed.
