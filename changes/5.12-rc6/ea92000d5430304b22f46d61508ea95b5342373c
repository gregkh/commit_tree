Revert "net: Have netpoll bring-up DSA management interface"

This reverts commit 1532b9778478577152201adbafa7738b1e844868.

The above commit is good and it works, however it was meant as a bugfix
for stable kernels and now we have more self-contained ways in DSA to
handle the situation where the DSA master must be brought up.
