tracing: Add ptr-hash option to show the hashed pointer value

Add tracefs/options/hash-ptr option to show hashed pointer
value by %p in event printk format string.

For the security reason, normal printk will show the hashed
pointer value (encrypted by random number) with %p to printk
buffer to hide the real address. But the tracefs/trace always
shows real address for debug. To bridge those outputs, add an
option to switch the output format. Ftrace users can use it
to find the hashed value corresponding to the real address
in trace log.
