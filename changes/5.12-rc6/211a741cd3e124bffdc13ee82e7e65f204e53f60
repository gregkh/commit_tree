tools: Factor Clang, LLC and LLVM utils definitions

When dealing with BPF/BTF/pahole and DWARF v5 I wanted to build bpftool.

While looking into the source code I found duplicate assignments in misc tools
for the LLVM eco system, e.g. clang and llvm-objcopy.

Move the Clang, LLC and/or LLVM utils definitions to tools/scripts/Makefile.include
file and add missing includes where needed. Honestly, I was inspired by the commit
c8a950d0d3b9 ("tools: Factor HOSTCC, HOSTLD, HOSTAR definitions").

I tested with bpftool and perf on Debian/testing AMD64 and LLVM/Clang v11.1.0-rc1.

Build instructions:

[ make and make-options ]
MAKE="make V=1"
MAKE_OPTS="HOSTCC=clang HOSTCXX=clang++ HOSTLD=ld.lld CC=clang LD=ld.lld LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1"
MAKE_OPTS="$MAKE_OPTS PAHOLE=/opt/pahole/bin/pahole"

[ clean-up ]
$MAKE $MAKE_OPTS -C tools/ clean

[ bpftool ]
$MAKE $MAKE_OPTS -C tools/bpf/bpftool/

[ perf ]
PYTHON=python3 $MAKE $MAKE_OPTS -C tools/perf/

I was careful with respecting the user's wish to override custom compiler, linker,
GNU/binutils and/or LLVM utils settings.
