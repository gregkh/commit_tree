platform/x86: dell-wmi-sysman: Make it safe to call exit_foo_attributes() multiple times

During some of the error-exit paths it is possible that
release_attributes_data() will get called multiple times,
which results in exit_foo_attributes() getting called multiple
times.

Make it safe to call exit_foo_attributes() multiple times,
avoiding double-free()s in this case.

Note that release_attributes_data() really should only be called
once during error-exit paths. This will be fixed in a separate patch
and it is good to have the exit_foo_attributes() functions modified
this way regardless.
