um: mm: check more comprehensively for stub changes

If userspace tries to change the stub, we need to kill it,
because otherwise it can escape the virtual machine. In a
few cases the stub checks weren't good, e.g. if userspace
just tries to

	mmap(0x100000 - 0x1000, 0x3000, ...)

it could succeed to get a new private/anonymous mapping
replacing the stubs. Fix this by checking everywhere, and
checking for _overlap_, not just direct changes.
