drm/edid: Parse DSC1.2 cap fields from HFVSDB block

This patch parses HFVSDB fields for DSC1.2 capabilities of an
HDMI2.1 sink. These fields are required by a source to understand the
DSC capability of the sink, to set appropriate PPS parameters,
before transmitting compressed data stream.

v2: Addressed following issues as suggested by Uma Shankar:
-Added a new struct for hdmi dsc cap
-Fixed bugs in macros usage.
