can: dev: can_rx_offload_get_echo_skb(): extend to return can frame length

In order to implement byte queue limits (bql) in CAN drivers, the length of the
CAN frame needs to be passed into the networking stack after queueing and after
transmission completion.

To avoid to calculate this length twice, extend can_rx_offload_get_echo_skb()
to return that value. Convert all users of this function, too.
