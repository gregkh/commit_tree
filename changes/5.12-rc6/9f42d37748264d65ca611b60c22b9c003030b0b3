btrfs: rework btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size

Currently btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size does two things, it returns
the space currently required for flushing by the tickets, and if there
are no tickets it calculates a value for the preemptive flushing.

However for the normal ticketed flushing we really only care about the
space required for tickets.  We will accidentally come in and flush one
time, but as soon as we see there are no tickets we bail out of our
flushing.

Fix this by making btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size really only tell us
what is required for flushing if we have people waiting on space.  Then
move the preemptive flushing logic into need_preemptive_reclaim().  We
ignore btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size() in need_preemptive_reclaim()
because if we are in this path then we made our reservation and there
are not pending tickets currently, so we do not need to check it, simply
do the fuzzy logic to check if we're getting low on space.
