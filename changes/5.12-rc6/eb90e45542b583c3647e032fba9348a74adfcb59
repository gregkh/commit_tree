scsi: target: core: Set residuals for 4Kn devices

TCM always fails SBC commands with residuals for 4Kn devices when the
command is processed by sbc_parse_cdb(). That prevents residual signalling
to the transport driver because residual kind and residual amount aren't
set. It also makes residual handling different from 512-byte formatted
devices - if there are residuals 512-byte LUN would proceed with command
execution while 4K-byte LUN would fail.
