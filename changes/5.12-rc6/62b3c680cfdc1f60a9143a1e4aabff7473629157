arm64: dts: socfpga: Use generic "ngpios" rather than "snps,nr-gpios"

This is to remove similar errors as below:

OF: /.../gpio-port@0: could not find phandle

Commit 7569486d79ae ("gpio: dwapb: Add ngpios DT-property support")
explained the reason of above errors well and added the generic
"ngpios" property, let's use it.
