net: dpaa2-mac: add backplane link mode support

Add support for backplane link mode, which is, according to discussions
with NXP earlier in the year, is a mode where the OS (Linux) is able to

This commit prepares the ground work for allowing 1G fiber connections
to be used with DPAA2 on the SolidRun CEX7 platforms.
