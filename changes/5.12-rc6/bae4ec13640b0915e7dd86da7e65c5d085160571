sched/fair: Move avg_scan_cost calculations under SIS_PROP

As noted by Vincent Guittot, avg_scan_costs are calculated for SIS_PROP
even if SIS_PROP is disabled. Move the time calculations under a SIS_PROP
check and while we are at it, exclude the cost of initialising the CPU
mask from the average scan cost.
