csky: Fixup futex SMP implementation

Arnd said:
I would guess that for csky, this is a mistake, as the architecture
is fairly new and should be able to implement it.

Guo reply:
The c610, c807, c810 don't support SMP, so futex_cmpxchg_enabled = 1
with asm-generic's implementation.
For c860, there is no HAVE_FUTEX_CMPXCHG and cmpxchg_inatomic/inuser
implementation, so futex_cmpxchg_enabled = 0.

Thx for point it out, we'll implement cmpxchg_inatomic/inuser for
C860 and still use asm-generic for non-smp CPUs.

LTP test:
futex_wait01    1  TPASS  :  futex_wait(): errno=ETIMEDOUT(110): Connection timed out
futex_wait01    2  TPASS  :  futex_wait(): errno=EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK(11): Resource temporarily unavailable
futex_wait01    3  TPASS  :  futex_wait(): errno=ETIMEDOUT(110): Connection timed out
futex_wait01    4  TPASS  :  futex_wait(): errno=EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK(11): Resource temporarily unavailable
futex_wait02    1  TPASS  :  futex_wait() woken up
futex_wait03    1  TPASS  :  futex_wait() woken up
futex_wait04    1  TPASS  :  futex_wait() returned -1: errno=EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK(11): Resource temporarily unavailable
