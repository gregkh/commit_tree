PCI: rpadlpar: Fix potential drc_name corruption in store functions

Both add_slot_store() and remove_slot_store() try to fix up the
drc_name copied from the store buffer by placing a NUL terminator at
nbyte + 1 or in place of a '\n' if present. However, the static buffer
that we copy the drc_name data into is not zeroed and can contain
anything past the n-th byte.

This is problematic if a '\n' byte appears in that buffer after nbytes
and the string copied into the store buffer was not NUL terminated to
start with as the strchr() search for a '\n' byte will mark this
incorrectly as the end of the drc_name string resulting in a drc_name
string that contains garbage data after the n-th byte.

Additionally it will cause us to overwrite that '\n' byte on the stack
with NUL, potentially corrupting data on the stack.

The following debugging shows an example of the drmgr utility writing
"PHB 4543" to the add_slot sysfs attribute, but add_slot_store()
logging a corrupted string value.

  drmgr: drmgr: -c phb -a -s PHB 4543 -d 1
  add_slot_store: drc_name = PHB 4543Â°|<82>!, rc = -19

Fix this by using strscpy() instead of memcpy() to ensure the string
is NUL terminated when copied into the static drc_name buffer.
Further, since the string is now NUL terminated the code only needs to
change '\n' to '\0' when present.
