soc: qcom-geni-se: Cleanup the code to remove proxy votes

This reverts commit 048eb908a1f2 ("soc: qcom-geni-se: Add interconnect
support to fix earlycon crash")

ICC core and platforms drivers supports sync_state feature, which
ensures that the default ICC BW votes from the bootloader is not
removed until all it's consumers are probes.

The proxy votes were needed in case other QUP child drivers
I2C, SPI probes before UART, they can turn off the QUP-CORE clock
which is shared resources for all QUP driver, this causes unclocked
access to HW from earlycon.

Given above support from ICC there is no longer need to maintain
proxy votes on QUP-CORE ICC node from QUP wrapper driver for early
console usecase, the default votes won't be removed until real
console is probed.
