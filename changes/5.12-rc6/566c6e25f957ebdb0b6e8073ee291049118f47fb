drm/amdgpu: Set a suitable dev_info.gart_page_size

In Mesa, dev_info.gart_page_size is used for alignment and it was
set to AMDGPU_GPU_PAGE_SIZE(4KB). However, the page table of AMDGPU
driver requires an alignment on CPU pages.  So, for non-4KB page system,
gart_page_size should be max_t(u32, PAGE_SIZE, AMDGPU_GPU_PAGE_SIZE).
