bnxt_en: attempt to reinitialize after aborted reset

Drawing a hard line on aborted resets prevents a NIC open in
some scenarios that may otherwise be recoverable. For example,
if a firmware recovery happened while a PF was down and an
attempt was made to bring up an associated VF in this state,
then it was impossible to ever bring up this VF without a
rebind or reload of its driver.

Attempt to reinitialize the firmware when an aborted reset (or
failed init after a reset) is discovered during open - it may
succeed. Also take care to allow the user to retry opening the
NIC even after an aborted reset.
