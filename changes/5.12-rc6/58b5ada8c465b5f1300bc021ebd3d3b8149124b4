pinctrl: qcom: fix unintentional string concatenation

clang is clearly correct to point out a typo in a silly
array of strings:

drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-sdx55.c:426:61: error: suspicious concatenation of string literals in an array initialization; did you mean to separate the elements with a comma? [-Werror,-Wstring-concatenation]
        "gpio14", "gpio15", "gpio16", "gpio17", "gpio18", "gpio19" "gpio20", "gpio21", "gpio22",
                                                                   ^
Add the missing comma that must have accidentally been removed.
