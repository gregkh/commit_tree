vme: make remove callback return void

The driver core ignores the return value of struct bus_type::remove()
because there is only little that can be done. To simplify the quest to
make this function return void, let struct vme_driver::remove return void,
too. There is only a single vme driver and it already returns 0
unconditionally in .remove().

Also fix the bus remove function to always return 0.
