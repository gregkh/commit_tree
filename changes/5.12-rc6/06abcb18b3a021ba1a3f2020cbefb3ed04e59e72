ALSA: usb-audio: Apply the control quirk to Plantronics headsets

Other Plantronics headset models seem requiring the same workaround as
C320-M to add the 20ms delay for the control messages, too.  Apply the
workaround generically for devices with the vendor ID 0x047f.

Note that the problem didn't surface before 5.11 just with luck.
Since 5.11 got a big code rewrite about the stream handling, the
parameter setup procedure has changed, and this seemed triggering the
problem more often.
