mm/debug_vm_pgtable/basic: iterate over entire protection_map[]

Currently the basic tests just validate various page table transformations
after starting with vm_get_page_prot(VM_READ|VM_WRITE|VM_EXEC) protection.
Instead scan over the entire protection_map[] for better coverage.  It
also makes sure that all these basic page table tranformations checks hold
true irrespective of the starting protection value for the page table
entry.  There is also a slight change in the debug print format for basic
tests to capture the protection value it is being tested with.  The
modified output looks something like

[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic ()
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (write)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read|write)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (exec)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read|exec)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (write|exec)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read|write|exec)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (shared)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read|shared)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (write|shared)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read|write|shared)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (exec|shared)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read|exec|shared)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (write|exec|shared)
[pte_basic_tests          ]: Validating PTE basic (read|write|exec|shared)

This adds a missing argument 'struct mm_struct *' in pud_basic_tests()
test .  This never got exposed before as PUD based THP is available only
on X86 platform where mm_pmd_folded(mm) call gets macro replaced without
requiring the mm_struct i.e __is_defined(__PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED).
