pinctrl: intel: Show the GPIO base calculation explicitly

During the split of intel_pinctrl_add_padgroups(), the _by_size() variant
missed the GPIO base calculations and hence made unable to retrieve proper
GPIO number.

Assign the gpio_base explicitly in _by_size() variant.

While at it, differentiate NOMAP case with the rest in _by_gpps() variant.
