virtio_input: Prevent EV_MSC/MSC_TIMESTAMP loop storm for MT.

In 'commit 29cc309d8bf1 ("HID: hid-multitouch: forward MSC_TIMESTAMP")',
EV_MSC/MSC_TIMESTAMP is added to each before EV_SYN event. EV_MSC is
configured as INPUT_PASS_TO_ALL.
In case of a touch device which report MSC_TIMESTAMP:
  BE pass EV_MSC/MSC_TIMESTAMP to FE on receiving event from evdev.
  FE pass EV_MSC/MSC_TIMESTAMP back to BE.
  BE writes EV_MSC/MSC_TIMESTAMP to evdev due to INPUT_PASS_TO_ALL.
  BE receives extra EV_MSC/MSC_TIMESTAMP and pass to FE.
>>> Each new frame becomes larger and larger.

Disable EV_MSC/MSC_TIMESTAMP forwarding for MT.

V2: Rebase.
