ath11k: pci: remove experimental warning

I have received feedback that QCA6390 PCI support is working for many, and I'm
also using QCA6390 on my daily driver^Hlaptop. While there are issues still
to be resolved it's not really experimental anymore, so remove the experimental
warning from driver initialisation.

Tested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-01740-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1
