IMA: limit critical data measurement based on a label

Integrity critical data may belong to a single subsystem or it may
arise from cross subsystem interaction.  Currently there is no mechanism
to group or limit the data based on certain label.  Limiting and
grouping critical data based on a label would make it flexible and
configurable to measure.

Define "label:=", a new IMA policy condition, for the IMA func
CRITICAL_DATA to allow grouping and limiting measurement of integrity
critical data.

Limit the measurement to the labels that are specified in the IMA
policy - CRITICAL_DATA+"label:=".  If "label:=" is not provided with
the func CRITICAL_DATA, measure all the input integrity critical data.
