hv_netvsc: Restrict configurations on isolated guests

Restrict the NVSP protocol version(s) that will be negotiated with the
host to be NVSP_PROTOCOL_VERSION_61 or greater if the guest is running
isolated.  Moreover, do not advertise the SR-IOV capability and ignore
NVSP_MSG_4_TYPE_SEND_VF_ASSOCIATION messages in isolated guests, which
are not supposed to support SR-IOV.  This reduces the footprint of the
code that will be exercised by Confidential VMs and hence the exposure
to bugs and vulnerabilities.
