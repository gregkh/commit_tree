pwm: rockchip: Replace "bus clk" with "PWM clk"

Clarify the Rockchip PWM driver's error messages by referring to the clock
that operates a PWM device as the "PWM" clock, matching its name in the
device tree, rather than the "bus" clock (which is especially misleading in
the case of devices that also use a separate clock for bus access).
