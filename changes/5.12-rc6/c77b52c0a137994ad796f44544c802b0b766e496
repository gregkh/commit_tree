gfs2: Add common helper for holding and releasing the freeze glock

Many places in the gfs2 code queued and dequeued the freeze glock.
Almost all of them acquire it in SHARED mode, and need to specify the
same LM_FLAG_NOEXP and GL_EXACT flags.

This patch adds common helper functions gfs2_freeze_lock and gfs2_freeze_unlock
to make the code more readable, and to prepare for the next patch.
