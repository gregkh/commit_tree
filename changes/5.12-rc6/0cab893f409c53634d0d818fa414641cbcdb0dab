Revert "PM: runtime: Update device status before letting suppliers suspend"

Revert commit 44cc89f76464 ("PM: runtime: Update device status
before letting suppliers suspend") that introduced a race condition
into __rpm_callback() which allowed a concurrent rpm_resume() to
run and resume the device prematurely after its status had been
changed to RPM_SUSPENDED by __rpm_callback().
