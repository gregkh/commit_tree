drm/compat: Clear bounce structures

Some of them have gaps, or fields we don't clear. Native ioctl code
does full copies plus zero-extends on size mismatch, so nothing can
leak. But compat is more hand-rolled so need to be careful.

None of these matter for performance, so just memset.

Also I didn't fix up the CONFIG_DRM_LEGACY or CONFIG_DRM_AGP ioctl, those
are security holes anyway.
