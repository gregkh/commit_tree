HID: ite: Enable QUIRK_TOUCHPAD_ON_OFF_REPORT on Acer Aspire Switch 10E

The Acer Aspire Switch 10E (SW3-016)'s keyboard-dock uses the same USB-ids
as the Acer One S1003 keyboard-dock. Yet they are not entirely the same:

1. The S1003 keyboard-dock has the same report descriptors as the
S1002 keyboard-dock (which has different USB-ids)

2. The Acer Aspire Switch 10E's keyboard-dock has different
report descriptors from the S1002/S1003 keyboard docks and it
sends 0x00880078 / 0x00880079 usage events when the touchpad is
toggled on/off (which is handled internally).

This means that all Acer kbd-docks handled by the hid-ite.c drivers
report their touchpad being toggled on/off through these custom
usage-codes with the exception of the S1003 dock, which likely is
a bug of that dock.

Add a QUIRK_TOUCHPAD_ON_OFF_REPORT quirk for the Aspire Switch 10E / S1003
usb-id so that the touchpad toggling will get reported to userspace on
the Aspire Switch 10E.

Since the Aspire Switch 10E's kbd-dock has different report-descriptors,
this also requires adding support for fixing those to ite_report_fixup().

Setting the quirk will also cause ite_report_fixup() to hit the
S1002/S1003 descriptors path on the S1003. Since the S1003 kbd-dock
never generates any input-reports for the fixed up part of the
descriptors this does not matter; and if there are versions out there
which do actually send input-reports for the touchpad-toggle then the
fixup should actually help to make things work.

This was tested on both an Acer Aspire Switch 10E and on an Acer One S1003.
