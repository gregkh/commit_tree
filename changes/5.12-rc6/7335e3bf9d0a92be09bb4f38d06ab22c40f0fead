io_uring: don't forget to adjust io_size

We have invariant in io_read() of how much we're trying to read spilled
into an iter and io_size variable. The last one controls decision making
about whether to do read-retries. However, io_size is modified only
after the first read attempt, so if we happen to go for a third retry in
a single call to io_read(), we will get io_size greater than in the
iterator, so may lead to various side effects up to live-locking.

Modify io_size each time.
