x86/fpu/xstate: Use sizeof() instead of a constant

Use sizeof() instead of a constant in fpstate_sanitize_xstate().
Remove use of the address of the 0th array element of ->st_space and
->xmm_space which is equivalent to the array address itself:

No code changed:

  # arch/x86/kernel/fpu/xstate.o:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   9694     899       4   10597    2965 xstate.o.before
   9694     899       4   10597    2965 xstate.o.after
