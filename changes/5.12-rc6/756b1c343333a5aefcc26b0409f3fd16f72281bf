xfs: use current->journal_info for detecting transaction recursion

Because the iomap code using PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS to detect transaction
recursion in XFS is just wrong. Remove it from the iomap code and
replace it with XFS specific internal checks using
current->journal_info instead.

[djwong: This change also realigns the lifetime of NOFS flag changes to
match the incore transaction, instead of the inconsistent scheme we have
now.]
