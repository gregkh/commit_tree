arm64: dts: pmi8998: Add the right interrupts for LAB/IBB SCP and OCP

In commit 208921bae696 ("arm64: dts: qcom: pmi8998: Add nodes for
LAB and IBB regulators") bindings for the lab/ibb regulators were
added to the pmi8998 dt, but the original committer has never
specified what the interrupts were for.
LAB and IBB regulators provide two interrupts, SC-ERR (short
circuit error) and VREG-OK but, in that commit, the regulators
were provided with two different types of interrupts;
specifically, IBB had the SC-ERR interrupt, while LAB had the
VREG-OK one, none of which were (luckily) used, since the driver
didn't actually use these at all.
Assuming that the original intention was to have the SC IRQ in
both LAB and IBB, as per the names appearing in documentation,
fix the SCP interrupt.

While at it, also add the OCP interrupt in order to be able to
enable the Over-Current Protection feature, if requested.
