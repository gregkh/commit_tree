s390/qeth: remove qeth_get_ip_version()

Replace our home-grown helper with the more robust vlan_get_protocol().
This is pretty much a 1:1 replacement, we just need to pass around a
proper ETH_P_* everyhwere and convert the old value range.

For readability also convert the protocol checks in
qeth_l3_hard_start_xmit() to a switch statement.
