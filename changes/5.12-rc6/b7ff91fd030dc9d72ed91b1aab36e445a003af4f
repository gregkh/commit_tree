ext4: find old entry again if failed to rename whiteout

If we failed to add new entry on rename whiteout, we cannot reset the
old->de entry directly, because the old->de could have moved from under
us during make indexed dir. So find the old entry again before reset is
needed, otherwise it may corrupt the filesystem as below.

  /dev/sda: Entry '00000001' in ??? (12) has deleted/unused inode 15. CLEARED.
  /dev/sda: Unattached inode 75
  /dev/sda: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
