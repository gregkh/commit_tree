vfio/type1: massage unmap iteration

Modify the iteration in vfio_dma_do_unmap so it does not depend on deletion
of each dma entry.  Add a variant of vfio_find_dma that returns the entry
with the lowest iova in the search range to initialize the iteration.  No
externally visible change, but this behavior is needed in the subsequent
update-vaddr patch.
