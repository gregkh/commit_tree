nexthop: Extract a common helper for parsing dump attributes

Requests to dump nexthops have many attributes in common with those that
requests to dump buckets of resilient NH groups will have. However, they
have different policies. To allow reuse of this code, extract a
policy-agnostic wrapper out of nh_valid_dump_req(), and convert this
function into a thin wrapper around it.
