octeontx2-af: Remove TOS field from MKEX TX

The MKEX profile describes what packet fields need to be extracted from
the input packet and how to place those packet fields in the output key
for MCAM matching.  The MKEX profile can be in a way where higher layer
packet fields can overwrite lower layer packet fields in output MCAM
Key.
Hence MKEX profile is always ensured that there are no overlaps between
any of the layers. But the commit 42006910b5ea
("octeontx2-af: cleanup KPU config data") introduced TX TOS field which
overlaps with DMAC in MCAM key.
This led to AF driver returning error when TX rule is installed with
DMAC as match criteria since DMAC gets overwritten and cannot be
supported. This patch fixes the issue by removing TOS field from MKEX TX
profile.
