btrfs: free correct amount of space in btrfs_delayed_inode_reserve_metadata

Following commit f218ea6c4792 ("btrfs: delayed-inode: Remove wrong
qgroup meta reservation calls") this function now reserves num_bytes,
rather than the fixed amount of nodesize. As such this requires the
same amount to be freed in case of failure. Fix this by adjusting
the amount we are freeing.
