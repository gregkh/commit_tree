net/mlx5e: Offload tuple rewrite for non-CT flows

Setting connection tracking OVS flows and then setting non-CT flows that
use tuple rewrite action (e.g. mod_tp_dst), causes the latter flows not
being offloaded.

Fix by using a stricter condition in modify_header_match_supported() to
check tuple rewrite support only for flows with CT action. The check is
factored out into standalone modify_tuple_supported() function to aid
readability.
