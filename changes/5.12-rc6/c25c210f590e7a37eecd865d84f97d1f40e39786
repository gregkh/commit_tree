usb: dwc3: qcom: add URS Host support for sdm845 ACPI boot

For sdm845 ACPI boot, the URS (USB Role Switch) node in ACPI DSDT table
holds the memory resource, while interrupt resources reside in the child
nodes USB0 and UFN0.  It adds USB0 host support by probing URS node,
creating platform device for USB0 node, and then retrieve interrupt
resources from USB0 platform device.
