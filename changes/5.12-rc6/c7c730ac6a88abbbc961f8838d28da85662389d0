scsi: ufs: Remove stringize operator '#' restriction

Current EM macro definition, we use stringize operator '#', which turns the
argument it precedes into a quoted string. Thus requires the symbol of
__print_symbolic() should be the string corresponding to the name of the
enum.

However, we have other cases, the symbol and enum name are not the same, we
can redefine EM/EMe, but there will introduce some redundant codes.  This
patch is to remove this restriction, let others reuse the current EM/EMe
definition.
