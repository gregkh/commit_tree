vt: drop old FONT ioctls

Drop support for these ioctls:
* PIO_FONT, PIO_FONTX
* GIO_FONT, GIO_FONTX
* PIO_FONTRESET

As was demonstrated by commit 90bfdeef83f1 (tty: make FONTX ioctl use
the tty pointer they were actually passed), these ioctls are not used
from userspace, as:
1) they used to be broken (set up font on current console, not the open
   one) and racy (before the commit above)
2) KDFONTOP ioctl is used for years instead

Note that PIO_FONTRESET is defunct on most systems as VGA_CONSOLE is set
on them for ages. That turns on BROKEN_GRAPHICS_PROGRAMS which makes
PIO_FONTRESET just return an error.

We are removing KD_FONT_FLAG_OLD here as it was used only by these
removed ioctls. kd.h header exists both in kernel and uapi headers, so
we can remove the kernel one completely. Everyone includeing kd.h will
now automatically get the uapi one.

There are now unused definitions of the ioctl numbers and "struct
consolefontdesc" in kd.h, but as it is a uapi header, I am not touching
these.
