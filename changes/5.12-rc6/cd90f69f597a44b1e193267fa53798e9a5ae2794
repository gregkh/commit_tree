dmaengine: INTEL_LDMA should depend on X86

The Intel Lightning Mountain (LGM) DMA controller is only present on
Intel Lightning Mountain SoCs.  Hence add a dependency on X86, to
prevent asking the user about this driver when configuring a kernel
without Intel Lightning Mountain platform support.

While at it, fix a misspelling of "Intel".
