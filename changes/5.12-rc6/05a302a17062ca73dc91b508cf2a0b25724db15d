xfs: set WQ_SYSFS on all workqueues in debug mode

When CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=y, set WQ_SYSFS on all workqueues that we create
so that we (developers) have a means to monitor cpu affinity and whatnot
for background workers.  In the next patchset we'll expose knobs for
more of the workqueues publicly and document it, but not now.
