refscale: Allow summarization of verbose output

The refscale test prints enough per-kthread console output to provoke RCU
CPU stall warnings on large systems.  This commit therefore allows this
output to be summarized.  For example, the refscale.verbose_batched=32
boot parameter would causes only every 32nd line of output to be logged.
