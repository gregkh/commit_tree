staging: comedi: addi_apci_1032: Fix endian problem for COS sample

The Change-Of-State (COS) subdevice supports Comedi asynchronous
commands to read 16-bit change-of-state values.  However, the interrupt
handler is calling `comedi_buf_write_samples()` with the address of a
32-bit integer `&s->state`.  On bigendian architectures, it will copy 2
bytes from the wrong end of the 32-bit integer.  Fix it by transferring
the value via a 16-bit integer.
