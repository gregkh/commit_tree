KVM: x86/mmu: Consider the hva in mmu_notifier retry

Track the range being invalidated by mmu_notifier and skip page fault
retries if the fault address is not affected by the in-progress
invalidation. Handle concurrent invalidations by finding the minimal
range which includes all ranges being invalidated. Although the combined
range may include unrelated addresses and cannot be shrunk as individual
invalidation operations complete, it is unlikely the marginal gains of
proper range tracking are worth the additional complexity.

The primary benefit of this change is the reduction in the likelihood of
extreme latency when handing a page fault due to another thread having
been preempted while modifying host virtual addresses.
