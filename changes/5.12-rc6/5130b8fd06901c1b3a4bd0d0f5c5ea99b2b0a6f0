rcu: Introduce kfree_rcu() single-argument macro

There is a kvfree_rcu() single argument macro that handles pointers
returned by kvmalloc(). Even though it also handles pointer returned by
kmalloc(), readability suffers.

This commit therefore updates the kfree_rcu() macro to explicitly pair
with kmalloc(), thus improving readability.
