video: fbdev: aty: Delete unused variable in radeon_monitor

Fix warning about variable that is asssigned a value but never used.
The variable was indeed never used so delete it.

Keep the call to radeon_probe_i2c_connector() as it may have
side-effects. It is unlikely but I could not verify that is was safe to
drop the call.
