rtc: armada38x: depend on OF

The driver will compile with warning without OF because armada38x_data and
armada8k_data will be defined but not used. It would be possible to move
then in the #ifdef CONFIG_OF section but then their members will be defined
but not used. Instead of moving most of the driver in the #ifdef, simply
depend on OF.
