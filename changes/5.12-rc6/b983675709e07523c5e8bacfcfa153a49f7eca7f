drm/i915/display: Attach content type property for LSPCON

Content type is supported on HDMI sink devices. Attached the
property for the same for LSPCON based devices.

v2: Added the content type programming when we are attaching
the property to connector, as suggested by Ville.

v3: Need to attach content type on intel_dp_add_properties
as creating of new properties is not possible at late_register.
