xen/events: reset affinity of 2-level event when tearing it down

When creating a new event channel with 2-level events the affinity
needs to be reset initially in order to avoid using an old affinity
from earlier usage of the event channel port. So when tearing an event
channel down reset all affinity bits.

The same applies to the affinity when onlining a vcpu: all old
affinity settings for this vcpu must be reset. As percpu events get
initialized before the percpu event channel hook is called,
resetting of the affinities happens after offlining a vcpu (this is
working, as initial percpu memory is zeroed out).
