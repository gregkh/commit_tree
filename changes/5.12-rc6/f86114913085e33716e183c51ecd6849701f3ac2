clk: qcom: gcc-msm8998: Mark gpu_cfg_ahb_clk as critical

The GPU IOMMU depends on this clock and the hypervisor will crash
the SoC if this clock gets disabled because the secure contexts
that have been set on this IOMMU by the bootloader will become
unaccessible (or they get reset).
Mark this clock as critical to avoid this issue when the Adreno
GPU is enabled.
