thunderbolt: Allow disabling XDomain protocol

This allows disabling XDomain protocol completely if the user does not
plan to use the USB4/Thunderbolt peer-to-peer functionality, or for
security reasons.

XDomain protocol is enabled by default but with this commit it is
possible to disable it by passing "xdomain=0" as module parameter (or
through the kernel command line).
