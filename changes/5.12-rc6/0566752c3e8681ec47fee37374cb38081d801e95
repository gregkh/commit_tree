uapi: map_to_7segment: Update example in documentation

The device_attribute .show() and .store() methods gained an extra
parameter in v2.6.13, but the example in the documentation for the
7-segment header file was never updated.  Add the missing parameters.

While at it, get rid of the (misspelled) deprecated symbolic
permissions, and switch to DEVICE_ATTR_RW(), which was introduced in
v3.11
