drm/msm/a5xx: Remove overwriting A5XX_PC_DBG_ECO_CNTL register

The PC_DBG_ECO_CNTL register on the Adreno A5xx family gets
programmed to some different values on a per-model basis.
At least, this is what we intend to do here;

Unfortunately, though, this register is being overwritten with a
static magic number, right after applying the GPU-specific
configuration (including the GPU-specific quirks) and that is
effectively nullifying the efforts.

Let's remove the redundant and wrong write to the PC_DBG_ECO_CNTL
register in order to retain the wanted configuration for the
target GPU.
