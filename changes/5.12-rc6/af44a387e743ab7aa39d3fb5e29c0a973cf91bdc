Revert "xen: fix p2m size in dom0 for disabled memory hotplug case"

This partially reverts commit 882213990d32 ("xen: fix p2m size in dom0
for disabled memory hotplug case")

There's no need to special case XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC anymore in order
to correctly size the p2m. The generic memory hotplug option has
already been tied together with the Xen hotplug limit, so enabling
memory hotplug should already trigger a properly sized p2m on Xen PV.

Note that XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC depends on ZONE_DEVICE which pulls in
MEMORY_HOTPLUG.

Leave the check added to __set_phys_to_machine and the adjusted
comment about EXTRA_MEM_RATIO.
