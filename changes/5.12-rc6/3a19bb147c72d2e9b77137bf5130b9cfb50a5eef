xfs: Check for extent overflow when adding/removing xattrs

Adding/removing an xattr can cause XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH extents to be
added. One extra extent for dabtree in case a local attr is large enough
to cause a double split.  It can also cause extent count to increase
proportional to the size of a remote xattr's value.
