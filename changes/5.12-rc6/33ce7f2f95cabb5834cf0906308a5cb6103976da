drm/imx: imx-ldb: fix out of bounds array access warning

When CONFIG_OF is disabled, building with 'make W=1' produces warnings
about out of bounds array access:

drivers/gpu/drm/imx/imx-ldb.c: In function 'imx_ldb_set_clock.constprop':
drivers/gpu/drm/imx/imx-ldb.c:186:8: error: array subscript -22 is below array bounds of 'struct clk *[4]' [-Werror=array-bounds]

Add an error check before the index is used, which helps with the
warning, as well as any possible other error condition that may be
triggered at runtime.

The warning could be fixed by adding a Kconfig depedency on CONFIG_OF,
but Liu Ying points out that the driver may hit the out-of-bounds
problem at runtime anyway.
