platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Create 2 separate input-devs for buttons and switches

Create 2 separate input-devs for buttons and switches, this is a
preparation for dynamically registering the switches-input device
for devices which are not on the switches allow-list, but do make
Notify() calls with an event value from the switches sparse-keymap.

This also brings the intel-vbtn driver inline with the intel-hid
driver which is doing the same thing.
