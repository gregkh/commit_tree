crypto: aesni - refactor scatterlist processing

Currently, the gcm(aes-ni) driver open codes the scatterlist handling
that is encapsulated by the skcipher walk API. So let's switch to that
instead.

Also, move the handling at the end of gcmaes_crypt_by_sg() that is
dependent on whether we are encrypting or decrypting into the callers,
which always do one or the other.
