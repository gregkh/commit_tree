x86/build: Add {kvm_guest,xen}.config targets to make help's output

Add the targets which add additional items to the .config which
facilitate running the kernel as a guest, to the 'make help' output so
that they can be found easier and there's no need to grep the tree each
time to remember what they should be called.
