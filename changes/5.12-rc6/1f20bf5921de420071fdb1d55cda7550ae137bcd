drm/panel: s6e63m0: Support max-brightness

The "max-brightness" is a standard backlight property that
we need to support for the Samsung GT-I8190 Golden because
the display will go black if we crank up the brightness
too high.

As the platform needs this ability to give picture this is
a regression fix along with the addition of the property
to the GT-I8190 device tree.
