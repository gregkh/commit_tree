perf/x86/intel: Support CPUID 10.ECX to disable fixed counters

With Architectural Performance Monitoring Version 5, CPUID 10.ECX cpu
leaf indicates the fixed counter enumeration. This extends the previous
count to a bitmap which allows disabling even lower fixed counters.
It could be used by a Hypervisor.

The existing intel_ctrl variable is used to remember the bitmask of the
counters. All code that reads all counters is fixed to check this extra
bitmask.
