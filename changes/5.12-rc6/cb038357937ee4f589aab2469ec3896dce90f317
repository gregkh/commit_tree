net: fix race between napi kthread mode and busy poll

Currently, napi_thread_wait() checks for NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit to
determine if the kthread owns this napi and could call napi->poll() on
it. However, if socket busy poll is enabled, it is possible that the
busy poll thread grabs this SCHED bit (after the previous napi->poll()
invokes napi_complete_done() and clears SCHED bit) and tries to poll
on the same napi. napi_disable() could grab the SCHED bit as well.
This patch tries to fix this race by adding a new bit
NAPI_STATE_SCHED_THREADED in napi->state. This bit gets set in
____napi_schedule() if the threaded mode is enabled, and gets cleared
in napi_complete_done(), and we only poll the napi in kthread if this
bit is set. This helps distinguish the ownership of the napi between
kthread and other scenarios and fixes the race issue.
