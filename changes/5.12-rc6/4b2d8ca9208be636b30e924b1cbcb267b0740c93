x86/reboot: Add Zotac ZBOX CI327 nano PCI reboot quirk

On this system the M.2 PCIe WiFi card isn't detected after reboot, only
after cold boot. reboot=pci fixes this behavior. In [0] the same issue
is described, although on another system and with another Intel WiFi
card. In case it's relevant, both systems have Celeron CPUs.

Add a PCI reboot quirk on affected systems until a more generic fix is
available.
