remove Dan Murphy from TI from MAINTAINERS

Dan's address bounces, and has been bouncing for some time as he moved
to other projects.

I believe TI should be more careful with this, and should assign
alternate contacts for their drivers.

Anyway what we can do now is to remove the obsolete address.
