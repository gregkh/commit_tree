tcp: shrink inet_connection_sock icsk_mtup enabled and probe_size

This commit shrinks inet_connection_sock by 4 bytes, by shrinking
icsk_mtup.enabled from 32 bits to 1 bit, and shrinking
icsk_mtup.probe_size from s32 to an unsuigned 31 bit field.

This is to save space to compensate for the recent introduction of a
new u32 in inet_connection_sock, icsk_probes_tstamp, in the recent bug
fix commit 9d9b1ee0b2d1 ("tcp: fix TCP_USER_TIMEOUT with zero window").

This should not change functionality, since icsk_mtup.enabled is only
ever set to 0 or 1, and icsk_mtup.probe_size can only be either 0
or a positive MTU value returned by tcp_mss_to_mtu()
