net/sched: act_api: fix miss set post_ct for ovs after do conntrack in act_ct

When openvswitch conntrack offload with act_ct action. The first rule
do conntrack in the act_ct in tc subsystem. And miss the next rule in
the tc and fallback to the ovs datapath but miss set post_ct flag
which will lead the ct_state_key with -trk flag.
