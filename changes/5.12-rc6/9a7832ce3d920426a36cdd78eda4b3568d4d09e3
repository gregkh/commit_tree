perf/x86/intel/uncore: With > 8 nodes, get pci bus die id from NUMA info

The registers used to determine which die a pci bus belongs to don't
contain enough information to uniquely specify more than 8 dies, so
when more than 8 dies are present, use NUMA information instead.

Continue to use the previous method for 8 or fewer because it
works there, and covers cases of NUMA being disabled.
