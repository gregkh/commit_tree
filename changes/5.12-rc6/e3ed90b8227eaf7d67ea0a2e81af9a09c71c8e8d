drm/i915/gt: Drain the breadcrumbs just once

Matthew Brost pointed out that the while-loop on a shared breadcrumb was
inherently fraught with danger as it competed with the other users of
the breadcrumbs. However, in order to completely drain the re-arming irq
worker, the while-loop is a necessity, despite my optimism that we could
force cancellation with a couple of irq_work invocations.

Given that we can't merely drop the while-loop, use an activity counter on
the breadcrumbs to detect when we are parking the breadcrumbs for the
last time.

Based on a patch by Matthew Brost.
