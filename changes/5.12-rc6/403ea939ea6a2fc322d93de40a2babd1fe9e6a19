iwlwifi: dbg: Mark ucode tlv data as const

The ucode TLV data may be read-only and should be treated as const
pointers, but currently a few code forcibly cast to the writable
pointer unnecessarily.  This gave developers a wrong impression as if
it can be modified, resulting in crashing regressions already a couple
of times.

This patch adds the const prefix to those cast pointers, so that such
attempt can be caught more easily in future.
