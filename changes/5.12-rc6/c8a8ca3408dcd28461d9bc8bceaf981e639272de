i40e: remove unnecessary memory writes of the next to clean pointer

For performance reasons, avoid writing the ring next-to-clean pointer
value back to memory on every update, as it is not really necessary.
Instead, simply read it at initialization into a local copy, update
the local copy as necessary and write the local copy back to memory
after the last update.
