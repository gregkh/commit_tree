usb/gadget: f_midi: Replace tasklet with work

Currently a tasklet is used to transmit input substream buffer
data. However, tasklets have long been deprecated as being too
heavy on the system by running in irq context - and this is not
a performance critical path. If a higher priority process wants
to run, it must wait for the tasklet to finish before doing so.

Deferring work to a workqueue and executing in process context
should be fine considering the callback already does
f_midi_do_transmit() under the transmit_lock and thus changes in
semantics are ok regarding concurrency - tasklets being serialized
against itself.
