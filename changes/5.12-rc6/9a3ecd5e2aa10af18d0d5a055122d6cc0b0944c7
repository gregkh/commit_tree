KVM: X86: Rename DR6_INIT to DR6_ACTIVE_LOW

DR6_INIT contains the 1-reserved bits as well as the bit that is cleared
to 0 when the condition (e.g. RTM) happens. The value can be used to
initialize dr6 and also be the XOR mask between the #DB exit
qualification (or payload) and DR6.

Concerning that DR6_INIT is used as initial value only once, rename it
to DR6_ACTIVE_LOW and apply it in other places, which would make the
incoming changes for bus lock debug exception more simple.
