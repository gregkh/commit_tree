media: mach-pxa: Register the camera sensor fixed-rate clock

The pxa-camera capture driver currently registers a v4l2-clk
clock, named "mclk", to represent the mt9m111 sensor clock.

Register a proper fixed-rate clock using the generic clock framework,
which will allow to remove the v4l2-clk clock in the pxa-camera
driver in a follow-up commit.
