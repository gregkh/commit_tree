s390: split cleanup_sie

The current code uses the address in %r11 to figure out whether
it was called from the machine check handler or from a normal
interrupt handler. Instead of doing this implicit logic (which
is mostly a leftover from the old critical cleanup approach)
just add a second label and use that.
