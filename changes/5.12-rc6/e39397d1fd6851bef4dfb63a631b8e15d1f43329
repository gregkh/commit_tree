x86/hyperv: implement an MSI domain for root partition

When Linux runs as the root partition on Microsoft Hypervisor, its
interrupts are remapped.  Linux will need to explicitly map and unmap
interrupts for hardware.

Implement an MSI domain to issue the correct hypercalls. And initialize
this irq domain as the default MSI irq domain.
