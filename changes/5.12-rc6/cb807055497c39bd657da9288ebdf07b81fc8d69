drm/i915: Limit plane stride to below TILEOFF.x limit

Limit pre-skl plane stride to below 4k or 8k pixels (depending on
the platform). We do this in order guarantee that TILEOFF/OFFSET.x
does not get too big.

Currently this is not a problem as we align SURF to 4k, and so
TILEOFF/OFFSET only have to deal with a single tile's worth of
pixels. But for async flips we're going to have to bump SURF
alignment to 256k, and thus we can no longer guarantee
TILEOFF/OFFSET.x will stay within acceptable bounds. We can avoid
this by borrowing a trick from the skl+ code and limit the max
plane stride to whatever value we can fit into TILEOFF/OFFSET.x.

The slight downside is that we may end up doing GTT remapping in
a few more cases where previously we did not have to. But since
that will only happen with huge buffers I'm not really concerned
about it.
