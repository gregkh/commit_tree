USB: usbtmc: Add separate USBTMC_IOCTL_GET_SRQ_STB

This new ioctl only returns the status byte (STB) that was originally
sent by the device due to a service request (SRQ) condition.

This ioctl checks the srq_asserted bit of the associated file
descriptor. If set, the srq_asserted bit is reset and the cached
STB with original SRQ information is returned. Otherwise the ioctl
returns the error code ENOMSG.

This ioctl is useful to support non USBTMC-488 compliant devices.
Time sensitive applications can read the cached STB without incurring
the cost of an urb transaction over the bus.
