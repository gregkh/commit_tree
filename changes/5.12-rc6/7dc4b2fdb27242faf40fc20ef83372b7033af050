vfio/type1: fix unmap all on ILP32

Some ILP32 architectures support mapping a 32-bit vaddr within a 64-bit
iova space.  The unmap-all code uses 32-bit SIZE_MAX as an upper bound on
the extent of the mappings within iova space, so mappings above 4G cannot
be found and unmapped.  Use U64_MAX instead, and use u64 for size variables.
This also fixes a static analysis bug found by the kernel test robot running
smatch for ILP32.
