serial: stm32: improve platform_get_irq condition handling in init_port

Replace "ret" variable by "irq" variable from platform_get_irq condition
handling in stm32_init_port as suggested by Jiri in "STM32 uart cleanup and
improvement" series review.
This change will prevent port->irq to be unexpectly modified by a potential
change of "ret" value introduced by a new patch.
