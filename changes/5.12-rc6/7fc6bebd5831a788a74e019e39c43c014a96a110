ASoC: soc-pcm: add soc_get_playback_capture() and simplify soc_new_pcm()

soc_new_pcm() implementation is very long / verbose / complex,
thus, it is very difficult to read.
If we read it carefully, we can notice that it is consisted by

	int soc_new_pcm(...)
	{
		(1) judging playback/caputre part
		(2) creating the PCM part
		(3) setup pcm/rtd part
	}

This patch adds new soc_get_playback_capture() for (1) part
and offload it from soc_new_pcm().
