parisc: Bump 64-bit IRQ stack size to 64 KB

Bump 64-bit IRQ stack size to 64 KB.

I had a kernel IRQ stack overflow on the mx3210 debian buildd machine.  This patch increases the
64-bit IRQ stack size to 64 KB.  The 64-bit stack size needs to be larger than the 32-bit stack
size since registers are twice as big.
