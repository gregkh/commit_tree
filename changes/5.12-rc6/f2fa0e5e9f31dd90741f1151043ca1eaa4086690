xen/events: link interdomain events to associated xenbus device

In order to support the possibility of per-device event channel
settings (e.g. lateeoi spurious event thresholds) add a xenbus device
pointer to struct irq_info() and modify the related event channel
binding interfaces to take the pointer to the xenbus device as a
parameter instead of the domain id of the other side.

While at it remove the stale prototype of bind_evtchn_to_irq_lateeoi().
