tools/nolibc: Fix position of -lgcc in the documented example

The documentation header in the nolibc.h file provides an example command
line, but it places the -lgcc argument before the source files, which
can fail with libgcc.a (e.g. on ARM when uidiv is needed). This commit
therefore moves the -lgcc to the end of the command line, hopefully
before this example leaks into makefiles.  This is a port of nolibc's
upstream commit b5e282089223 to the Linux kernel.
