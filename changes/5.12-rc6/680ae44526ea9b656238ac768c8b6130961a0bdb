ARM: tegra: Don't enable unused PLLs on resume from suspend

PLLC and PLLM are usually disabled on system suspend because all devices
which use these PLLs are either suspended or switched away to other clock
source. Don't enable unused PLLs on resume from suspend by keeping track
of the enable-state of the PLLs across suspend-resume.
