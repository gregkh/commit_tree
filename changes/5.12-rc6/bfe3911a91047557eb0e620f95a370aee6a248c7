kcmp: Support selection of SYS_kcmp without CHECKPOINT_RESTORE

Userspace has discovered the functionality offered by SYS_kcmp and has
started to depend upon it. In particular, Mesa uses SYS_kcmp for
os_same_file_description() in order to identify when two fd (e.g. device
or dmabuf) point to the same struct file. Since they depend on it for
core functionality, lift SYS_kcmp out of the non-default
CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE into the selectable syscall category.

Rasmus Villemoes also pointed out that systemd uses SYS_kcmp to
deduplicate the per-service file descriptor store.

Note that some distributions such as Ubuntu are already enabling
CHECKPOINT_RESTORE in their configs and so, by extension, SYS_kcmp.
