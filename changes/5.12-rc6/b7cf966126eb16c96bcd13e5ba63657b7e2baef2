octeontx2-pf: Add flow classification using IP next level protocol

This patch adds support to install flow rules using ipv4 proto or
ipv6 next header field to distinguish between tcp/udp/sctp/esp/ah
flows when user doesn't specify the other match creteria related to
the flow such as tcp/udp/sctp source port and destination port, ah/esp
spi value. This is achieved by matching the layer type extracted by
NPC HW into the search key. Modified the driver to use Ethertype as
match criteria when user doesn't specify source IP address and dest
IP address. The esp/ah flow rule matching using security parameter
index (spi) is not supported as of now since the field is not extracted
into MCAM search key. Modified npc_check_field function to return bool.
