net: sched: Add multi-queue support to sch_tree_lock

The existing qdiscs that set TCQ_F_MQROOT don't use sch_tree_lock.
However, hardware-offloaded HTB will start setting this flag while also
using sch_tree_lock.

The current implementation of sch_tree_lock basically locks on
qdisc->dev_queue->qdisc, and it works fine when the tree is attached to
some queue. However, it's not the case for MQROOT qdiscs: such a qdisc
is the root itself, and its dev_queue just points to queue 0, while not
actually being used, because there are real per-queue qdiscs.

This patch changes the logic of sch_tree_lock and sch_tree_unlock to
lock the qdisc itself if it's the MQROOT.
