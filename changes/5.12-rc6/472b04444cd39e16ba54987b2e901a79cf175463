crypto: keembay - Add Keem Bay OCS HCU driver

Add support for the Hashing Control Unit (HCU) included in the Offload
Crypto Subsystem (OCS) of the Intel Keem Bay SoC, thus enabling
hardware-accelerated hashing on the Keem Bay SoC for the following
algorithms:
- sha256
- sha384
- sha512
- sm3

The driver is composed of two files:

- 'ocs-hcu.c' which interacts with the hardware and abstracts it by
  providing an API following the usual paradigm used in hashing drivers
  / libraries (e.g., hash_init(), hash_update(), hash_final(), etc.).
  NOTE: this API can block and sleep, since completions are used to wait
  for the HW to complete the hashing.

- 'keembay-ocs-hcu-core.c' which exports the functionality provided by
  'ocs-hcu.c' as a ahash crypto driver. The crypto engine is used to
  provide asynchronous behavior. 'keembay-ocs-hcu-core.c' also takes
  care of the DMA mapping of the input sg list.

The driver passes crypto manager self-tests, including the extra tests
(CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS=y).
