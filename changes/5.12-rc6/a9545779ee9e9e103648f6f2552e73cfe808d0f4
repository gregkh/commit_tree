KVM: Use kvm_pfn_t for local PFN variable in hva_to_pfn_remapped()

Use kvm_pfn_t, a.k.a. u64, for the local 'pfn' variable when retrieving
a so called "remapped" hva/pfn pair.  In theory, the hva could resolve to
a pfn in high memory on a 32-bit kernel.

This bug was inadvertantly exposed by commit bd2fae8da794 ("KVM: do not
assume PTE is writable after follow_pfn"), which added an error PFN value
to the mix, causing gcc to comlain about overflowing the unsigned long.
