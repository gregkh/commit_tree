usb: dwc3: gadget: Use max speed if unspecified

If the gadget driver doesn't specify a max_speed, then use the
controller's maximum supported speed as default. For DWC_usb32 IP, the
gadget's speed maybe limited to gen2x1 rate only if the driver's
max_speed is unknown. This scenario should not occur with the current
implementation since the default gadget driver's max_speed should always
be specified. However, to make the driver more robust and help with
readability, let's cover all the scenarios in __dwc3_gadget_set_speed().
