iio: adc: qcom-vadc-common: rewrite vadc7 die temp calculation

qcom_vadc7_scale_hw_calib_die_temp() uses a table format different from
the rest of volt/temp conversion functions in this file. Also the
conversion functions results in non-monothonic values conversion, which
seems wrong.

Rewrite qcom_vadc7_scale_hw_calib_die_temp() to use
qcom_vadc_map_voltage_temp() directly, like the rest of conversion
functions do.
