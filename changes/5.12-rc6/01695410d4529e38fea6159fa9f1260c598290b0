hwmon: (pwm-fan) Store tach data separately

The data for the (optional) fan tachometer input is moved to a separate
structure which is only allocated if an input is actually configured.

After this change the pulse IRQ handler takes a pointer to the
tachometer data structure instead of the whole device context.
