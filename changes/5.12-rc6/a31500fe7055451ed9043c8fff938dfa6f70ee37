drm/tegra: dc: Restore coupling of display controllers

Coupling of display controllers used to rely on runtime PM to take the
companion controller out of reset. Commit fd67e9c6ed5a ("drm/tegra: Do
not implement runtime PM") accidentally broke this when runtime PM was
removed.

Restore this functionality by reusing the hierarchical host1x client
suspend/resume infrastructure that's similar to runtime PM and which
perfectly fits this use-case.
