xhci: Fix repeated xhci wake after suspend due to uncleared internal wake state

If port terminations are detected in suspend, but link never reaches U0
then xHCI may have an internal uncleared wake state that will cause an
immediate wake after suspend.

This wake state is normally cleared when driver clears the PORT_CSC bit,
which is set after a device is enabled and in U0.

Write 1 to clear PORT_CSC for ports that don't have anything connected
when suspending. This makes sure any pending internal wake states in
xHCI are cleared.
