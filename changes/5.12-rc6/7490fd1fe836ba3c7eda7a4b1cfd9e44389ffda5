RDMA/rtrs: Extend ibtrs_cq_qp_create

rtrs does not have same limit for both max_send_wr and max_recv_wr,
To allow client and server set different values, export in a separate
parameter for rtrs_cq_qp_create.

Also fix the type accordingly, u32 should be used instead of u16.

Fixes: c0894b3ea69d ("RDMA/rtrs: core: lib functions shared between client and server modules")
