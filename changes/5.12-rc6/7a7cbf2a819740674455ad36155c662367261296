drm/msm: Fix race of GPU init vs timestamp power management.

We were using the same force-poweron bit in the two codepaths, so they
could race to have one of them lose GPU power early.

freedreno CI was seeing intermittent errors like:
[drm:_a6xx_gmu_set_oob] *ERROR* Timeout waiting for GMU OOB set GPU_SET: 0x0
and this issue could have contributed to it.
