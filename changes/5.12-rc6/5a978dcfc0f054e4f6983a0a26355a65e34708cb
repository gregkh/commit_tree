io_uring: always go for cancellation spin on exec

Always try to do cancellation in __io_uring_task_cancel() at least once,
so it actually goes and cleans its sqpoll tasks (i.e. via
io_sqpoll_cancel_sync()), otherwise sqpoll task may submit new requests
after cancellation and it's racy for many reasons.
