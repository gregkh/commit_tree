platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Increase virtual timeout from 3 to 5 seconds

Increasing the virtual timeout time to account for scenarios
that may require more time, like DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport
(DP MST), where the disconnect time can be extended longer than
usual.

The recommended timeout range is 5-10 seconds, of which
we will take the lower bound.
