vfio/type1: Prepare for batched pinning with struct vfio_batch

Get ready to pin more pages at once with struct vfio_batch, which
represents a batch of pinned pages.

The struct has a fallback page pointer to avoid two unlikely scenarios:
pointlessly allocating a page if disable_hugepages is enabled or failing
the whole pinning operation if the kernel can't allocate memory.

vaddr_get_pfn() becomes vaddr_get_pfns() to prepare for handling
multiple pages, though for now only one page is stored in the pages
array.
