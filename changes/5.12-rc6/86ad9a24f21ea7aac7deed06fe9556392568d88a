PM / devfreq: Add required OPPs support to passive governor

Look at the required OPPs of the "parent" device to determine the OPP that
is required from the slave device managed by the passive governor. This
allows having mappings between a parent device and a slave device even when
they don't have the same number of OPPs.

While at it do a minor spell-fix and remove out label.
