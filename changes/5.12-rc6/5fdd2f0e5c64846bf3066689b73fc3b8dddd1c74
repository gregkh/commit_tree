net: add sysfs attribute to control napi threaded mode

This patch adds a new sysfs attribute to the network device class.
Said attribute provides a per-device control to enable/disable the
threaded mode for all the napi instances of the given network device,
without the need for a device up/down.
User sets it to 1 or 0 to enable or disable threaded mode.
Note: when switching between threaded and the current softirq based mode
for a napi instance, it will not immediately take effect if the napi is
currently being polled. The mode switch will happen for the next time
napi_schedule() is called.
