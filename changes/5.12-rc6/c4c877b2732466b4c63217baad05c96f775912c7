net: Consolidate common blackhole dst ops

Move generic blackhole dst ops to the core and use them from both
ipv4_dst_blackhole_ops and ip6_dst_blackhole_ops where possible. No
functional change otherwise. We need these also in other locations
and having to define them over and over again is not great.
