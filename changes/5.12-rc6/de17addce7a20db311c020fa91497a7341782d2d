btrfs: zoned: implement copying for zoned device-replace

This is 3/4 patch to implement device-replace on zoned filesystems.

This commit implements copying. To do this, it tracks the write pointer
during the device replace process. As device-replace's copy process is
smart enough to only copy used extents on the source device, we have to
fill the gap to honor the sequential write requirement in the target
device.

The device-replace process on zoned filesystems must copy or clone all
the extents in the source device exactly once. So, we need to ensure
allocations started just before the dev-replace process to have their
corresponding extent information in the B-trees.
finish_extent_writes_for_zoned() implements that functionality, which
basically is the removed code in the commit 042528f8d840 ("Btrfs: fix
block group remaining RO forever after error during device replace").
