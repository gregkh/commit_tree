clk: qcom: rcg2: Rectify clk_gfx3d rate rounding without mux division

In case the mux is not divided parent_req was mistakenly not assigned to
leading __clk_determine_rate to determine the best frequency setting for
a requested rate of 0, resulting in the msm8996 platform not booting.
Rectify this by refactoring the logic to unconditionally assign to
parent_req.rate with the clock rate the caller is expecting.
