regulator: ab8500: Remove unused platform data

The struct ab8500_regulator_platform_data was a leftover
since the days before we probed all regulators from the
device tree. The ab8500-ext regulator was the only used,
defining platform data and register intialization that
was never used for anything, a copy of a boardfile no
longer in use.

Delete the ab8500_regulator_platform_data and make the
ab8500-ext regulator reference the regulator init data
in the local file directly. We are 100% device tree
these days.
