init: lto: fix PREL32 relocations

With LTO, the compiler can rename static functions to avoid global
naming collisions. As initcall functions are typically static,
renaming can break references to them in inline assembly. This
change adds a global stub with a stable name for each initcall to
fix the issue when PREL32 relocations are used.
