coresight: tpiu: Prepare for using coresight device access abstraction

Prepare the TPIU driver to make use of the CoreSight device access
abstraction layer. The driver touches the device even before the
coresight device is registered. Thus we could be accessing the
devices without a csdev. As we are about to use the abstraction
layer for accessing the device, pass in the access directly
to avoid having to deal with the un-initialised csdev.
