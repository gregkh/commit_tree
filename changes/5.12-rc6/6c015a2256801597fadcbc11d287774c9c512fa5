net: check all name nodes in __dev_alloc_name

__dev_alloc_name(), when supplied with a name containing '%d',
will search for the first available device number to generate a
unique device name.

Since commit ff92741270bf8b6e78aa885f166b68c7a67ab13a ("net:
introduce name_node struct to be used in hashlist") network
devices may have alternate names.  __dev_alloc_name() does take
these alternate names into account, possibly generating a name
that is already taken and failing with -ENFILE as a result.

This demonstrates the bug:

    # rmmod dummy 2>/dev/null
    # ip link property add dev lo altname dummy0
    # modprobe dummy numdummies=1
    modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'dummy': Too many open files in system

Instead of creating a device named dummy1, modprobe fails.

Fix this by checking all the names in the d->name_node list, not just d->name.
