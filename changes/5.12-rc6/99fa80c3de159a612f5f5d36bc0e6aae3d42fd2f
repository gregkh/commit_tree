ARM: dts: aspeed: amd-ethanolx: Enable secondary LPC snooping address

AMD EthanolX CRB uses 2-byte POST codes which are sent to ports 0x80/0x81.
Currently ASPEED controller snoops only 0x80 port and therefore captures
only the lower byte of each POST code.
Enable secondary LPC snooping address to capture the higher byte of POST
codes.
