cxl/mem: Add a "RAW" send command

The CXL memory device send interface will have a number of supported
commands. The raw command is not such a command. Raw commands allow
userspace to send a specified opcode to the underlying hardware and
bypass all driver checks on the command. The primary use for this
command is to [begrudgingly] allow undocumented vendor specific hardware
commands.

While not the main motivation, it also allows prototyping new hardware
commands without a driver patch and rebuild.

While this all sounds very powerful it comes with a couple of caveats:
1. Bug reports using raw commands will not get the same level of
   attention as bug reports using supported commands (via taint).
2. Supported commands will be rejected by the RAW command.

With this comes new debugfs knob to allow full access to your toes with
your weapon of choice.
