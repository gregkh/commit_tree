drm/nouveau/kms: handle mDP connectors

In some cases we have the handle those explicitly as the fallback
connector type detection fails and marks those as eDP connectors.

Attempting to use such a connector with mutter leads to a crash of mutter
as it ends up with two eDP displays.

Information is taken from the official DCB documentation.
