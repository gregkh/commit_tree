ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable headset mic of Acer SWIFT with ALC256

The Acer SWIFT Swift SF314-54/55 laptops with ALC256 cannot detect
both the headset mic and the internal mic. Introduce new fixup
to enable the jack sense and the headset mic. However, the internal
mic actually connects to Intel SST audio. It still needs Intel SST
support to make internal mic capture work.
