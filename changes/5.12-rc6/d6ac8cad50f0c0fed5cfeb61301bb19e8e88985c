selftests/bpf: Move generated test files to $(TEST_GEN_FILES)

During an out-of-tree build, attempting to install the $(TEST_FILES)
into the $(OUTPUT) directory fails, because the objects were already
generated into $(OUTPUT):

rsync: [sender] link_stat "tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_lwt_ip_encap.o" failed: No such file or directory (2)
rsync: [sender] link_stat "tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_tc_edt.o" failed: No such file or directory (2)

Use $(TEST_GEN_FILES) instead.
