ASoC: Intel: bytcr_wm5102: Add machine driver for BYT/WM5102

Add a new ASoc Machine driver for Intel Baytrail platforms with a
Wolfson Microelectronics WM5102 codec.

This is based on a past contributions [1] from Paulo Sergio Travaglia
<pstglia@gmail.com> based on the Levono kernel [2] combined with
insights in things like the speaker GPIO from the android-x86 android
port for the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 1051F/L [3].

The original machine driver from the Android ports was a crude modified
copy of bytcr_rt5640.c adjusted to work with the WM5102 codec.
This version has been extensively reworked to:

1. Remove all rt5640 related quirk handling. to the best of my knowledge
this setup is only used on the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 series (8, 10 and 13
inch models) which all use the same setup. So there is no need to deal
with all the variations with which we need to deal on rt5640 boards.

2. Rework clock handling, properly turn off the FLL and the platform-clock
when they are no longer necessary and don't reconfigure the FLL
unnecessarily when it is already running. This fixes a number of:
"Timed out waiting for lock" warnings being logged.

3. Add the GPIO controlled Speaker-VDD regulator as a DAPM_SUPPLY

This only adds the machine driver and ACPI hooks, the BYT-CR detection
quirk which these devices need will be added in a separate patch.
