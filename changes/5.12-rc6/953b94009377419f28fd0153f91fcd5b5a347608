staging: qlge: Initialize devlink health dump framework

Initialize devlink health dump framework for the qlge driver so the
coredump could be done via devlink.

struct qlge_adapter is now used as the private data structure of
struct devlink so it could exist independently of struct net_device
and devlink reload could be supported in the future. The private data
of PCIe driver now points to qlge_adapter.

Since devlink_alloc will zero out struct qlge_adapter, memset in
qlge_init_device is not necessary.
