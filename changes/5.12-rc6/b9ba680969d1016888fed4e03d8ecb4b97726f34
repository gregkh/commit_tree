arm64/ptdump:display the Linear Mapping start marker

The current /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables does not display the
*Linear Mapping start* marker on arm64, which I think should be paired
with the *Linear Mapping end* marker.

Since *Linear Mapping start* is the first marker, use initialise 'level'
to -1 in order to display it.
