mmc: sdhci-msm: add Inline Crypto Engine support

Add support for Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine (ICE) to sdhci-msm.

The standard-compliant parts, such as querying the crypto capabilities
and enabling crypto for individual MMC requests, are already handled by
cqhci-crypto.c, which itself is wired into the blk-crypto framework.
However, ICE requires vendor-specific init, enable, and resume logic,
and it requires that keys be programmed and evicted by vendor-specific
SMC calls.  Make the sdhci-msm driver handle these details.

This is heavily inspired by the similar changes made for UFS, since the
UFS and eMMC ICE instances are very similar.  See commit df4ec2fa7a4d
("scsi: ufs-qcom: Add Inline Crypto Engine support").

I tested this on a Sony Xperia 10, which uses the Snapdragon 630 SoC,
which has basic upstream support.  Mainly, I used android-xfstests
(https://github.com/tytso/xfstests-bld/blob/master/Documentation/android-xfstests.md)
to run the ext4 and f2fs encryption tests in a Debian chroot:

	android-xfstests -c ext4,f2fs -g encrypt -m inlinecrypt

These tests included tests which verify that the on-disk ciphertext is
identical to that produced by a software implementation.  I also
verified that ICE was actually being used.
