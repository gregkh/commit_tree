pwm: iqs620a: Fix overflow and optimize calculations

If state->duty_cycle is 0x100000000000000, the previous calculation of
duty_scale overflows and yields a duty cycle ratio of 0% instead of
100%. Fix this by clamping the requested duty cycle to the maximal
possible duty cycle first. This way it is possible to use a native
integer division instead of a (depending on the architecture) more
expensive 64bit division.

With this change in place duty_scale cannot be bigger than 256 which
allows to simplify the calculation of duty_val.
