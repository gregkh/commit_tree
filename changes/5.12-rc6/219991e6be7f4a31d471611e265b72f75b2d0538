Bluetooth: Add new HCI_QUIRK_NO_SUSPEND_NOTIFIER quirk

Some devices, e.g. the RTL8723BS bluetooth part, some USB attached devices,
completely drop from the bus on a system-suspend. These devices will
have their driver unbound and rebound on resume (when the dropping of
the bus gets detected) and will show up as a new HCI after resume.

These devices do not benefit from the suspend / resume handling work done
by the hci_suspend_notifier. At best this unnecessarily adds some time to
the suspend/resume time. But this may also actually cause problems, if the
code doing the driver unbinding runs after the pm-notifier then the
hci_suspend_notifier code will try to talk to a device which is now in
an uninitialized state.

This commit adds a new HCI_QUIRK_NO_SUSPEND_NOTIFIER quirk which allows
drivers to opt-out of the hci_suspend_notifier when they know beforehand
that their device will be fully re-initialized / reprobed on resume.
