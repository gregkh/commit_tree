perf/x86/intel: Set PERF_ATTACH_SCHED_CB for large PEBS and LBR

To supply a PID/TID for large PEBS, it requires flushing the PEBS buffer
in a context switch.

For normal LBRs, a context switch can flip the address space and LBR
entries are not tagged with an identifier, we need to wipe the LBR, even
for per-cpu events.

For LBR callstack, save/restore the stack is required during a context
switch.

Set PERF_ATTACH_SCHED_CB for the event with large PEBS & LBR.
