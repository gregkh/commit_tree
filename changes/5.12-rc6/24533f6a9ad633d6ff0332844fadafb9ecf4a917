btrfs: save irq flags when looking up an ordered extent

A following patch will add another caller of
btrfs_lookup_ordered_extent(), but from a bio's endio context.

btrfs_lookup_ordered_extent() uses spin_lock_irq() which unconditionally
disables interrupts. Change this to spin_lock_irqsave() so interrupts
aren't disabled and re-enabled unconditionally.
