usb: dwc3: pci: ID for Tiger Lake CPU

Tiger Lake SOC (the versions of it that have integrated USB4
controller) may have two DWC3 controllers. One is part of
the PCH (Platform Controller Hub, i.e. the chipset) as
usual, and the other is inside the actual CPU block.

On all Intel platforms that have the two separate DWC3
controllers, the one inside the CPU handles USB3 and only
USB3 traffic, while the PCH version handles USB2 and USB2
alone. The reason for splitting the two busses like this is
to allow easy USB3 tunneling over USB4 connections. As USB2
is not tunneled over USB4, it has dedicated USB controllers
(both xHCI and DWC3).
