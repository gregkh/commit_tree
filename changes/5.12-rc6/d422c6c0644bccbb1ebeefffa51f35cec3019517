MIPS: Use address-of operator on section symbols

When building xway_defconfig with clang:

arch/mips/lantiq/prom.c:82:23: error: array comparison always evaluates
to true [-Werror,-Wtautological-compare]
        else if (__dtb_start != __dtb_end)
                             ^
1 error generated.

These are not true arrays, they are linker defined symbols, which are
just addresses. Using the address of operator silences the warning
and does not change the resulting assembly with either clang/ld.lld
or gcc/ld (tested with diff + objdump -Dr). Do the same thing across
the entire MIPS subsystem to ensure there are no more warnings around
this type of comparison.
