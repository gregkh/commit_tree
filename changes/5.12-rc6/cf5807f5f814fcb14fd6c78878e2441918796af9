ASoC: SOF: Intel: SoundWire: simplify Kconfig

The Kconfig file is way too convoluted. Track platforms where
SoundWire is supported, and add simpler conditions to make sure there
is no module/built-in issue.

The use of 'depends on' is less intuitive if a required 'depend' is
missing, but that's a small price to pay for clarity and simplicity.
