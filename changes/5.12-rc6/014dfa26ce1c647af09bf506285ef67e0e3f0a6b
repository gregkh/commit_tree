net: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: Provide TX and RX fifo sizes

MTU cannot be changed on dwmac-sun8i. (ip link set eth0 mtu xxx returning EINVAL)
This is due to tx_fifo_size being 0, since this value is used to compute valid
MTU range.
Like dwmac-sunxi (with commit 806fd188ce2a ("net: stmmac: dwmac-sunxi: Provide TX and RX fifo sizes"))
dwmac-sun8i need to have tx and rx fifo sizes set.
I have used values from datasheets.
After this patch, setting a non-default MTU (like 1000) value works and network is still useable.
