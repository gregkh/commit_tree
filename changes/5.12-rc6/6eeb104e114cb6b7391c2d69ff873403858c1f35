fs: buffer: use raw page_memcg() on locked page

alloc_page_buffers() currently uses get_mem_cgroup_from_page() for
charging the buffers to the page owner, which does an rcu-protected
page->memcg lookup and acquires a reference.  But buffer allocation has
the page lock held throughout, which pins the page to the memcg and
thereby the memcg - neither rcu nor holding an extra reference during the
allocation are necessary.  Use a raw page_memcg() instead.

This was the last user of get_mem_cgroup_from_page(), delete it.
