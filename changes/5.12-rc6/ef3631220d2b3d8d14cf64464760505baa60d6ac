net: ks8851: Register MDIO bus and the internal PHY

The KS8851 has a reduced internal PHY, which is accessible through its
registers at offset 0xe4. The PHY is compatible with KS886x PHY present
in Micrel switches, except the PHY ID Low/High registers are swapped.
Register MDIO bus so this PHY can be detected and probed by phylib.
