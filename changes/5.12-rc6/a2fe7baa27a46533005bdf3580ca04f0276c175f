clk: xilinx: move xlnx_vcu clock driver from soc

The xlnx_vcu driver is actually a clock controller driver which provides
clocks that can be used by a driver for the encoder/decoder units. There
is no reason to keep this driver in soc. Move the driver to clk.

NOTE: The register mapping actually contains registers for AXI
performance monitoring, but these are not used by the driver.
