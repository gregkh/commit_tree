ext4: don't try to processed freed blocks until mballoc is initialized

If we try to make any changes via the journal between when the journal
is initialized, but before the multi-block allocated is initialized,
we will end up deferencing a NULL pointer when the journal commit
callback function calls ext4_process_freed_data().

The proximate cause of this failure was commit 2d01ddc86606 ("ext4:
save error info to sb through journal if available") since file system
corruption problems detected before the call to ext4_mb_init() would
result in a journal commit before we aborted the mount of the file
system.... and we would then trigger the NULL pointer deref.
