net: dsa: propagate extack to .port_vlan_filtering

Some drivers can't dynamically change the VLAN filtering option, or
impose some restrictions, it would be nice to propagate this info
through netlink instead of printing it to a kernel log that might never
be read. Also netlink extack includes the module that emitted the
message, which means that it's easier to figure out which ones are
driver-generated errors as opposed to command misuse.
