coresight: Introduce device access abstraction

We are about to introduce support for sysreg access to ETMv4.4+
component. Since there are generic routines that access the
registers (e.g, CS_LOCK/UNLOCK , claim/disclaim operations, timeout)
and in order to preserve the logic of these operations at a
single place we introduce an abstraction layer for the accesses
to a given device.
