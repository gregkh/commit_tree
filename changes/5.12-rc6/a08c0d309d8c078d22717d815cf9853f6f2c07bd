r8152: replace several functions about phy patch request

Replace r8153_patch_request() with rtl_phy_patch_request().
Replace r8153_pre_ram_code() with rtl_pre_ram_code().
Replace r8153_post_ram_code() with rtl_post_ram_code().
Add rtl_patch_key_set().

The new functions have an additional parameter. It is used to wait
the patch request command finished. When the PHY is resumed from
the state of power cut, the PHY is at a safe mode and the
OCP_PHY_PATCH_STAT wouldn't be updated. For this situation, it is
safe to set patch request command without waiting OCP_PHY_PATCH_STAT.
