staging: rtl8723bs: remove braces from two single line if blocks

Remove braces from both occurences of single line if blocks in
include/rtw_mlme.h, fixes two checkpatch warnings, thus clearing
this type of warning from this file.

Also swaps two if statement comparisons around, so the variable is on
the left in each one. This fixes two warnings also.
