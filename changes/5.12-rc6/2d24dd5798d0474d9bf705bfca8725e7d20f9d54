rbtree: Add generic add and find helpers

I've always been bothered by the endless (fragile) boilerplate for
rbtree, and I recently wrote some rbtree helpers for objtool and
figured I should lift them into the kernel and use them more widely.

Provide:

partial-order; less() based:
 - rb_add(): add a new entry to the rbtree
 - rb_add_cached(): like rb_add(), but for a rb_root_cached

total-order; cmp() based:
 - rb_find(): find an entry in an rbtree
 - rb_find_add(): find an entry, and add if not found

 - rb_find_first(): find the first (leftmost) matching entry
 - rb_next_match(): continue from rb_find_first()
 - rb_for_each(): iterate a sub-tree using the previous two

Inlining and constant propagation should see the compiler inline the
whole thing, including the various compare functions.
