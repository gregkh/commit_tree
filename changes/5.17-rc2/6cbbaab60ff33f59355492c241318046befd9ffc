KVM: nVMX: Allow VMREAD when Enlightened VMCS is in use

Hyper-V TLFS explicitly forbids VMREAD and VMWRITE instructions when
Enlightened VMCS interface is in use:

"Any VMREAD or VMWRITE instructions while an enlightened VMCS is
active is unsupported and can result in unexpected behavior.""

Windows 11 + WSL2 seems to ignore this, attempts to VMREAD VMCS field
0x4404 ("VM-exit interruption information") are observed. Failing
these attempts with nested_vmx_failInvalid() makes such guests
unbootable.

Microsoft confirms this is a Hyper-V bug and claims that it'll get fixed
eventually but for the time being we need a workaround. (Temporary) allow
VMREAD to get data from the currently loaded Enlightened VMCS.

Note: VMWRITE instructions remain forbidden, it is not clear how to
handle them properly and hopefully won't ever be needed.
