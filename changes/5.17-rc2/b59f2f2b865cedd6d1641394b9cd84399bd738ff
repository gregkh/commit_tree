tracing: Fix smatch warning for do while check in event_hist_trigger_parse()

The patch ec5ce0987541: "tracing: Allow whitespace to surround hist
trigger filter" from Jan 15, 2018, leads to the following Smatch
static checker warning:

    kernel/trace/trace_events_hist.c:6199 event_hist_trigger_parse()
    warn: 'p' can't be NULL.

Since p is always checked for a NULL value at the top of loop and
nothing in the rest of the loop will set it to NULL, the warning
is correct and might as well be 1 to silence the warning.
