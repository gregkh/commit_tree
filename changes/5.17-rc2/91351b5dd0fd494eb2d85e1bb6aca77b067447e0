irqchip/realtek-rtl: Fix off-by-one in routing

There is an offset between routing values (1..6) and the connected MIPS
CPU interrupts (2..7), but no distinction was made between these two
values.

This issue was previously hidden during testing, because an interrupt
mapping was used where for each required interrupt another (unused)
routing was configured, with an offset of +1.

Offset the CPU IRQ numbers by -1 to retrieve the correct routing value.
