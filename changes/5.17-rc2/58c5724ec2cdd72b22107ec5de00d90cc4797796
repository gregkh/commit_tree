tracing: Avoid -Warray-bounds warning for __rel_loc macro

Since -Warray-bounds checks the destination size from the type of given
pointer, __assign_rel_str() macro gets warned because it passes the
pointer to the 'u32' field instead of 'trace_event_raw_*' data structure.
Pass the data address calculated from the 'trace_event_raw_*' instead of
'u32' __rel_loc field.
