usb: dwc3: xilinx: Fix error handling when getting USB3 PHY

The code that looked up the USB3 PHY was ignoring all errors other than
EPROBE_DEFER in an attempt to handle the PHY not being present. Fix and
simplify the code by using devm_phy_optional_get and dev_err_probe so
that a missing PHY is not treated as an error and unexpected errors
are handled properly.
