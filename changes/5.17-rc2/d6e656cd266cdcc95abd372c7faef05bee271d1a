KVM: nVMX: WARN on any attempt to allocate shadow VMCS for vmcs02

WARN if KVM attempts to allocate a shadow VMCS for vmcs02.  KVM emulates
VMCS shadowing but doesn't virtualize it, i.e. KVM should never allocate
a "real" shadow VMCS for L2.

The previous code WARNed but continued anyway with the allocation,
presumably in an attempt to avoid NULL pointer dereference.
However, alloc_vmcs (and hence alloc_shadow_vmcs) can fail, and
indeed the sole caller does:

	if (enable_shadow_vmcs && !alloc_shadow_vmcs(vcpu))
		goto out_shadow_vmcs;

which makes it not a useful attempt.
