fsnotify: fix fsnotify hooks in pseudo filesystems

Commit 49246466a989 ("fsnotify: move fsnotify_nameremove() hook out of
d_delete()") moved the fsnotify delete hook before d_delete() so fsnotify
will have access to a positive dentry.

This allowed a race where opening the deleted file via cached dentry
is now possible after receiving the IN_DELETE event.

To fix the regression in pseudo filesystems, convert d_delete() calls
to d_drop() (see commit 46c46f8df9aa ("devpts_pty_kill(): don't bother
with d_delete()") and move the fsnotify hook after d_drop().

Add a missing fsnotify_unlink() hook in nfsdfs that was found during
the audit of fsnotify hooks in pseudo filesystems.

Note that the fsnotify hooks in simple_recursive_removal() follow
d_invalidate(), so they require no change.
