tracing: Propagate is_signed to expression

During expression parsing, a new expression field is created which
should inherit the properties of the operands, such as size and
is_signed.

is_signed propagation was missing, causing spurious errors with signed
operands.  Add it in parse_expr() and parse_unary() to fix the problem.
