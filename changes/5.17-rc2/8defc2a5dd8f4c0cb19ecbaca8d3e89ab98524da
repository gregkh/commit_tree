powerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix decrementer storm

The decrementer exception can fail to be cleared when the interrupt
returns in the case where the decrementer wraps with the next timer
still beyond decrementer_max. This results in a decrementer interrupt
storm. This is triggerable with small decrementer system with hard
and soft watchdogs disabled.

Fix this by always programming the decrementer if there was no timer.
