ucsi_ccg: Check DEV_INT bit only when starting CCG4

CCGx clears Bit 0:Device Interrupt in the INTR_REG
if CCGx is reset successfully. However, there might
be a chance that other bits in INTR_REG are not
cleared due to internal data queued in PPM. This case
misleads the driver that CCGx reset failed.

The commit checks bit 0 in INTR_REG and ignores other
bits. The ucsi driver would reset PPM later.
