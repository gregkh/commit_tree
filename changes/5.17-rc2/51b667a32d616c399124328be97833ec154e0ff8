MAINTAINERS: add common wireless and wireless-next trees

For easier maintenance we have decided to create common wireless and
wireless-next trees for all wireless patches. Old mac80211 and wireless-drivers
trees will not be used anymore.

While at it, add a wiki link to wireless drivers section and a patchwork link
to 802.11, mac80211 and rfkill sections. Also use https in patchwork links.
