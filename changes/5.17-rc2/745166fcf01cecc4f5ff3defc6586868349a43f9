octeontx2-af: Add KPU changes to parse NGIO as separate layer

With current KPU profile NGIO is being parsed along with CTAG as
a single layer. Because of this MCAM/ntuple rules installed with
ethertype as 0x8842 are not being hit. Adding KPU profile changes
to parse NGIO in separate ltype and CTAG in separate ltype.
