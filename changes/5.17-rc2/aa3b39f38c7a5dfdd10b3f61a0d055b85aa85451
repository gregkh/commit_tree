KVM: SVM: drop unnecessary code in svm_hv_vmcb_dirty_nested_enlightenments()

Commit 3fa5e8fd0a0e4 ("KVM: SVM: delay svm_vcpu_init_msrpm after
svm->vmcb is initialized") re-arranged svm_vcpu_init_msrpm() call in
svm_create_vcpu(), thus making the comment about vmcb being NULL
obsolete. Drop it.

While on it, drop superfluous vmcb_is_clean() check: vmcb_mark_dirty()
is a bit flip, an extra check is unlikely to bring any performance gain.
Drop now-unneeded vmcb_is_clean() helper as well.
