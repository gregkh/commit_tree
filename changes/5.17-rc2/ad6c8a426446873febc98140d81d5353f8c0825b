scsi: ufs: Use generic error code in ufshcd_set_dev_pwr_mode()

The return value of ufshcd_set_dev_pwr_mode() is passed to device PM
core. However, the function currently returns a SCSI result which the PM
core doesn't understand.  This might lead to unexpected behaviors in
userland; a platform reset was observed in Android.

Use a generic error code for SSU failures.
