ARM: 9180/1: Thumb2: align ALT_UP() sections in modules sufficiently

When building for Thumb2, the .alt.smp.init sections that are emitted by
the ALT_UP() patching code may not be 32-bit aligned, even though the
fixup_smp_on_up() routine expects that. This results in alignment faults
at module load time, which need to be fixed up by the fault handler.

So let's align those sections explicitly, and prevent this from occurring.
