ucount:  Make get_ucount a safe get_user replacement

When the ucount code was refactored to create get_ucount it was missed
that some of the contexts in which a rlimit is kept elevated can be
the only reference to the user/ucount in the system.

Ordinary ucount references exist in places that also have a reference
to the user namspace, but in POSIX message queues, the SysV shm code,
and the SIGPENDING code there is no independent user namespace
reference.

Inspection of the the user_namespace show no instance of circular
references between struct ucounts and the user_namespace.  So
hold a reference from struct ucount to i's user_namespace to
resolve this problem.
