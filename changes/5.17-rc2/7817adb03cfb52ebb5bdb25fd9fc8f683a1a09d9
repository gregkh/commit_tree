usb: typec: Only attempt to link USB ports if there is fwnode

The code that creates the links to the USB ports attached to
a connector inside the system assumed that the ACPI nodes
(fwnodes) always exist for the connectors, but it can not do
that.

There is no guarantee that every USB Type-C connector has
ACPI device node representing it in the ACPI tables, and
even if there are the nodes in the ACPI tables, the _STA
method in those nodes may still return 0 (which means the
device does not exist from ACPI PoW).

This fixes NULL pointer dereference that happens if the
nodes are missing.
