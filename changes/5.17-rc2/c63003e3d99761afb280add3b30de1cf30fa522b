net: cpsw: Properly initialise struct page_pool_params

The cpsw driver didn't properly initialise the struct page_pool_params
before calling page_pool_create(), which leads to crashes after the struct
has been expanded with new parameters.

The second Fixes tag below is where the buggy code was introduced, but
because the code was moved around this patch will only apply on top of the
commit in the first Fixes tag.

Fixes: c5013ac1dd0e ("net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: move set of common functions in cpsw_priv")
Fixes: 9ed4050c0d75 ("net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: add XDP support")
