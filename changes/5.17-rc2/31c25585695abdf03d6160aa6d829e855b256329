Revert "KVM: SVM: avoid infinite loop on NPF from bad address"

Revert a completely broken check on an "invalid" RIP in SVM's workaround
for the DecodeAssists SMAP errata.  kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_memslot() obviously
expects a gfn, i.e. operates in the guest physical address space, whereas
RIP is a virtual (not even linear) address.  The "fix" worked for the
problematic KVM selftest because the test identity mapped RIP.

Fully revert the hack instead of trying to translate RIP to a GPA, as the
non-SEV case is now handled earlier, and KVM cannot access guest page
tables to translate RIP.

This reverts commit e72436bc3a5206f95bb384e741154166ddb3202e.
