fanotify: remove variable set but not used

The code that uses the pointer info has been removed in 7326e382c21e
("fanotify: report old and/or new parent+name in FAN_RENAME event").
and fanotify_event_info() doesn't change 'event', so the declaration and
assignment of info can be removed.

Eliminate the following clang warning:
fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify_user.c:161:24: warning: variable ‘info’ set
but not used
