video: hyperv_fb: Fix validation of screen resolution

In the WIN10 version of the Synthetic Video protocol with Hyper-V,
Hyper-V reports a list of supported resolutions as part of the protocol
negotiation. The driver calculates the maximum width and height from
the list of resolutions, and uses those maximums to validate any screen
resolution specified in the video= option on the kernel boot line.

This method of validation is incorrect. For example, the list of
supported resolutions could contain 1600x1200 and 1920x1080, both of
which fit in an 8 Mbyte frame buffer.  But calculating the max width
and height yields 1920 and 1200, and 1920x1200 resolution does not fit
in an 8 Mbyte frame buffer.  Unfortunately, this resolution is accepted,
causing a kernel fault when the driver accesses memory outside the
frame buffer.

Instead, validate the specified screen resolution by calculating
its size, and comparing against the frame buffer size.  Delete the
code for calculating the max width and height from the list of
resolutions, since these max values have no use.  Also add the
frame buffer size to the info message to aid in understanding why
a resolution might be rejected.
