KVM: SVM: Never reject emulation due to SMAP errata for !SEV guests

Always signal that emulation is possible for !SEV guests regardless of
whether or not the CPU provided a valid instruction byte stream.  KVM can
read all guest state (memory and registers) for !SEV guests, i.e. can
fetch the code stream from memory even if the CPU failed to do so because
of the SMAP errata.
