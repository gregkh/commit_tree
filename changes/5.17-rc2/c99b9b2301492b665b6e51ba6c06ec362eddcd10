scsi: ufs: Treat link loss as fatal error

This event is raised when link is lost as specified in UFSHCI spec and that
means communication is not possible. Thus initializing UFS interface needs
to be done.

Make UFS driver considers Link Lost as fatal in the INT_FATAL_ERRORS
mask. This will trigger a host reset whenever a link lost interrupt occurs.
