Revert "tty: serial: Use fifo in 8250 console driver"

This reverts commit 5021d709b31b8a14317998a33cbc78be0de9ab30.

The patch is still a bit buggy, and this breaks some other hardware
types.  It needs to be resubmitted in a non-buggy way, and make sure the
other hardware types also continue to work properly.
