KVM: nVMX: eVMCS: Filter out VM_EXIT_SAVE_VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER

Enlightened VMCS v1 doesn't have VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER_VALUE field,
PIN_BASED_VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER is also filtered out already so it makes
sense to filter out VM_EXIT_SAVE_VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER too.

Note, none of the currently existing Windows/Hyper-V versions are known
to enable 'save VMX-preemption timer value' when eVMCS is in use, the
change is aimed at making the filtering future proof.
