selftests: mptcp: fix ipv6 routing setup

MPJ ipv6 selftests currently lack per link route to the server
net. Additionally, ipv6 subflows endpoints are created without any
interface specified. The end-result is that in ipv6 self-tests
subflows are created all on the same link, leading to expected delays
and sporadic self-tests failures.

Fix the issue by adding the missing setup bits.
