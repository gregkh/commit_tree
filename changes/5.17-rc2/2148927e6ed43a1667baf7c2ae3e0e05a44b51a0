net: sfp: ignore disabled SFP node

Commit ce0aa27ff3f6 ("sfp: add sfp-bus to bridge between network devices
and sfp cages") added code which finds SFP bus DT node even if the node
is disabled with status = "disabled". Because of this, when phylink is
created, it ends with non-null .sfp_bus member, even though the SFP
module is not probed (because the node is disabled).

We need to ignore disabled SFP bus node.
