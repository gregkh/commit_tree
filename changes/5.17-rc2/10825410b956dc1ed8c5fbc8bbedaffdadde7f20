blk-mq: Fix wrong wakeup batch configuration which will cause hang

Commit 180dccb0dba4f ("blk-mq: fix tag_get wait task can't be
awakened") will recalculate wake_batch when incrementing or decrementing
active_queues to avoid wake_batch > hctx_max_depth. At the same time, in
order to not affect performance as much as possible, the minimum wakeup
batch is set to 4. But when the QD is small (such as QD=1), if inc or dec
active_queues increases wakeup batch, that can lead to a hang:

Fix this problem with the following strategies:
QD          :  >= 32 | < 32
---------------------------------
wakeup batch:  8~4   | 3~1
