dm: properly fix redundant bio-based IO accounting

Record the start_time for a bio but defer the starting block core's IO
accounting until after IO is submitted using bio_start_io_acct_time().

This approach avoids the need to mess around with any of the
individual IO stats in response to a bio_split() that follows bio
submission.
