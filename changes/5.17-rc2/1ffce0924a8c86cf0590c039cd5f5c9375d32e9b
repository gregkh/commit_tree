KVM: x86/cpuid: Exclude unpermitted xfeatures sizes at KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID

With the help of xstate_get_guest_group_perm(), KVM can exclude unpermitted
xfeatures in cpuid.0xd.0.eax, in which case the corresponding xfeatures
sizes should also be matched to the permitted xfeatures.

To fix this inconsistency, the permitted_xcr0 and permitted_xss are defined
consistently, which implies 'supported' plus certain permissions for this
task, and it also fixes cpuid.0xd.1.ebx and later leaf-by-leaf queries.
