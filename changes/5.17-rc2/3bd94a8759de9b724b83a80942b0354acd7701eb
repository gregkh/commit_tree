arm64: errata: Add detection for TRBE invalid prohibited states

TRBE implementations affected by Arm erratum #2038923 might get TRBE into
an inconsistent view on whether trace is prohibited within the CPU. As a
result, the trace buffer or trace buffer state might be corrupted. This
happens after TRBE buffer has been enabled by setting TRBLIMITR_EL1.E,
followed by just a single context synchronization event before execution
changes from a context, in which trace is prohibited to one where it isn't,
or vice versa. In these mentioned conditions, the view of whether trace is
prohibited is inconsistent between parts of the CPU, and the trace buffer
or the trace buffer state might be corrupted. This adds a new errata
ARM64_ERRATUM_2038923 in arm64 errata framework.
