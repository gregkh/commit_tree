powerpc/bpf: Update ldimm64 instructions during extra pass

These instructions are updated after the initial JIT, so redo codegen
during the extra pass. Rename bpf_jit_fixup_subprog_calls() to clarify
that this is more than just subprog calls.

Fixes: 69c087ba6225b5 ("bpf: Add bpf_for_each_map_elem() helper")
