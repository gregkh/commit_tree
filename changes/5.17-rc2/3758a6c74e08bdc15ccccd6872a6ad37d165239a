arm64: extable: fix load_unaligned_zeropad() reg indices

In ex_handler_load_unaligned_zeropad() we erroneously extract the data and
addr register indices from ex->type rather than ex->data. As ex->type will
contain EX_TYPE_LOAD_UNALIGNED_ZEROPAD (i.e. 4):
 * We'll always treat X0 as the address register, since EX_DATA_REG_ADDR is
   extracted from bits [9:5]. Thus, we may attempt to dereference an
   arbitrary address as X0 may hold an arbitrary value.
 * We'll always treat X4 as the data register, since EX_DATA_REG_DATA is
   extracted from bits [4:0]. Thus we will corrupt X4 and cause arbitrary
   behaviour within load_unaligned_zeropad() and its caller.

Fix this by extracting both values from ex->data as originally intended.

On an MTE-enabled QEMU image we are hitting the following crash:
 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
