octeontx2-pf: cn10k: Ensure valid pointers are freed to aura

While freeing SQB pointers to aura, driver first memcpy to
target address and then triggers lmtst operation to free pointer
to the aura. We need to ensure(by adding dmb barrier)that memcpy
is finished before pointers are freed to the aura. This patch also
adds the missing sq context structure entry in debugfs.
