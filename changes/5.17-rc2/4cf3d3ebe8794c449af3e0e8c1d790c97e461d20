KVM: selftests: Don't skip L2's VMCALL in SMM test for SVM guest

Don't skip the vmcall() in l2_guest_code() prior to re-entering L2, doing
so will result in L2 running to completion, popping '0' off the stack for
RET, jumping to address '0', and ultimately dying with a triple fault
shutdown.

It's not at all obvious why the test re-enters L2 and re-executes VMCALL,
but presumably it serves a purpose.  The VMX path doesn't skip vmcall(),
and the test can't possibly have passed on SVM, so just do what VMX does.
