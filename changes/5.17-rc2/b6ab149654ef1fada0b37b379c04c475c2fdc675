net: lan966x: Fix sleep in atomic context when injecting frames

On lan966x, when injecting a frame it was polling the register
QS_INJ_STATUS to see if it can continue with the injection of the frame.
The problem was that it was using readx_poll_timeout which could sleep
in atomic context.
This patch fixes this issue by using readx_poll_timeout_atomic.
