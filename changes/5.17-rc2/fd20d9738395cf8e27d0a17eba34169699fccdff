net: bridge: vlan: fix memory leak in __allowed_ingress

When using per-vlan state, if vlan snooping and stats are disabled,
untagged or priority-tagged ingress frame will go to check pvid state.
If the port state is forwarding and the pvid state is not
learning/forwarding, untagged or priority-tagged frame will be dropped
but skb memory is not freed.
Should free skb when __allowed_ingress returns false.
