KVM: x86: nSVM: skip eax alignment check for non-SVM instructions

The bug occurs on #GP triggered by VMware backdoor when eax value is
unaligned. eax alignment check should not be applied to non-SVM
instructions because it leads to incorrect omission of the instructions
emulation.
Apply the alignment check only to SVM instructions to fix.
