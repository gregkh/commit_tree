i40e: Increase delay to 1 s after global EMP reset

Recently simplified i40e_rebuild causes that FW sometimes
is not ready after NVM update, the ping does not return.

Increase the delay in case of EMP reset.
Old delay of 300 ms was introduced for specific cards for 710 series.
Now it works for all the cards and delay was increased.
