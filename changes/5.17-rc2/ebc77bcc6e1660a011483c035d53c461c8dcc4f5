drm/amd/display/dc/calcs/dce_calcs: Fix a memleak in calculate_bandwidth()

In calculate_bandwidth(), the tag free_sclk and free_yclk are reversed,
which could lead to a memory leak of yclk.

Fix this bug by changing the location of free_sclk and free_yclk.

This bug was found by a static analyzer.

Builds with 'make allyesconfig' show no new warnings,
and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.
