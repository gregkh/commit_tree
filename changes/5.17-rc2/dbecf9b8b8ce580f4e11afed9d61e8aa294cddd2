ia64: make IA64_MCA_RECOVERY bool instead of tristate

In linux-next, IA64_MCA_RECOVERY uses the (new) function
make_task_dead(), which is not exported for use by modules.  Instead of
exporting it for one user, convert IA64_MCA_RECOVERY to be a bool
Kconfig symbol.

In a config file from "kernel test robot <lkp@intel.com>" for a
different problem, this linker error was exposed when
CONFIG_IA64_MCA_RECOVERY=m.

Fixes this build error:

  ERROR: modpost: "make_task_dead" [arch/ia64/kernel/mca_recovery.ko] undefined!
