KVM: SVM: Don't apply SEV+SMAP workaround on code fetch or PT access

Resume the guest instead of synthesizing a triple fault shutdown if the
instruction bytes buffer is empty due to the #NPF being on the code fetch
itself or on a page table access.  The SMAP errata applies if and only if
the code fetch was successful and ucode's subsequent data read from the
code page encountered a SMAP violation.  In practice, the guest is likely
hosed either way, but crashing the guest on a code fetch to emulated MMIO
is technically wrong according to the behavior described in the APM.
