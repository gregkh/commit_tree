scsi: ufs: ufshcd: fix possible unclocked register access

Vendor specific setup_clocks ops may depend on clocks managed by ufshcd
driver so if the vendor specific setup_clocks callback is called when
the required clocks are turned off, it results into unclocked register
access.

This change make sure that required clocks are enabled before vendor
specific setup_clocks callback is called.
