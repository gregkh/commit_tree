cxl: Configure PSL to not use APC virtual machines

APC virtual machines arent used on POWER-9 chips and are already
disabled in on-chip CAPP. They also need to be disabled on the PSL via
'PSL Data Send Control Register' by setting bit(47). This forces the
PSL to send commands to CAPP with queue.id == 0.
