bpf: fix formatting for bpf_perf_event_read() helper doc

Some edits brought to the last iteration of BPF helper functions
documentation introduced an error with RST formatting. As a result, most
of one paragraph is rendered in bold text when only the name of a helper
should be. Fix it, and fix formatting of another function name in the
same paragraph.
