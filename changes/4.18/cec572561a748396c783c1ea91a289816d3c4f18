xfs: bmap debugging should never panic the system

Don't panic() the system if the bmap records are garbage, just call
ASSERT which gives us the same backtrace but enables developers to
control if the system goes down or not.  This makes debugging with
generic/388 much easier because it won't reboot the machine midway
through a run just because btree_read_bufl returns EIO when the fs has
already shut down.
