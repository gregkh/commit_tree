jbd2: remove NULL check before calling kmem_cache_destroy()

The kmem_cache_destroy() function already checks for null pointers, so
we can remove the check at the call site.

This patch also sets jbd2_handle_cache and jbd2_inode_cache to be NULL
after freeing them in jbd2_journal_destroy_handle_cache().
