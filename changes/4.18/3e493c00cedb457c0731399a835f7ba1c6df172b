nvme-fc: fix nulling of queue data on reconnect

The reconnect path is calling the init routines to clear a queue
structure. But the queue structure has state that perhaps needs
to persist as long as the controller is live.

Remove the nvme_fc_init_queue() calls on reconnect.
The nvme_fc_free_queue() calls will clear state bits and reset
any relevant queue state for a new connection.
