bpf: Allow bpf_current_task_under_cgroup in interrupt

Currently, the bpf_current_task_under_cgroup helper has a check where if
the BPF program is running in_interrupt(), it will return -EINVAL. This
prevents the helper to be used in many useful scenarios, particularly
BPF programs attached to Perf Events.

This commit removes the check. Tested a few NMI (Perf Event) and some
softirq context, the helper returns the correct result.
