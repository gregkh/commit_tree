mmc: jz4740: Set clock rate to mmc->f_max rather than JZ_MMC_CLK_RATE

The maximum clock rate can be overridden by DT. The clock rate should
be set to the DT-specified value rather than the constant JZ_MMC_CLK_RATE
when this is done. If the maximum clock rate is not set by DT then
mmc->f_max will be set to JZ_MMC_CLK_RATE.
