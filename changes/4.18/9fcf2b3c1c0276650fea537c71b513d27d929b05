drm/atmel-hlcdc: check stride values in the first plane

The statement always evaluates to true since the struct fields
are arrays. This has shown up as a warning when compiling with
clang:
  warning: address of array 'desc->layout.xstride' will always
      evaluate to 'true' [-Wpointer-bool-conversion]

Check for values in the first plane instead.
