m68k: remove old ColdFire IO access support code

All the ColdFire IO access support code has been moved to io_no.h.
This means that all ColdFire support is at least now consistent no
matter whether the MMU is enabled or not for them.

Now that io_mm.h has reverted to only support the traditional m68k MMU
enabled processors we can remove the ColdFire specific definitions.

We can also remove the old ColdFire PCI bus IO access functions.
The new io_no.h uses asm-generic/io.h to provide all the basic support.
