Revert "lib/test_printf.c: call wait_for_random_bytes() before plain %p tests"

This reverts commit ee410f15b1418f2f4428e79980674c979081bcb7.

It might prevent the machine from boot. It would wait for enough
randomness at the very beginning of kernel_init(). But there is
basically nothing running in parallel that would help to produce
any randomness.
