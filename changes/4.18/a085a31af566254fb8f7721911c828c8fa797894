regulator: core: Parse coupled regulators properties

On Odroid XU3/4 and other Exynos5422 based boards there is a case, that
different devices on the board are supplied by different regulators
with non-fixed voltages. If one of these devices temporarily requires
higher voltage, there might occur a situation that the spread between
devices' voltages is so high, that there is a risk of changing
'high' and 'low' states on the interconnection between devices powered
by those regulators.

Add new structure "coupling_desc" to regulator_dev, which contains
pointers to all coupled regulators including the owner of the structure,
number of coupled regulators and counter of currently resolved
regulators.

Add of_functions to parse all data needed in regulator coupling.
Provide method to check DTS data consistency. Check if each coupled
regulator's max_spread is equal and if their lists of regulators match.
