xfs: make xfs_bmapi_remapi work with attribute forks

Add a new flags argument to xfs_bmapi_remapi so that we can pass BMAPI
flags into the function.  This enables us to pass in BMAPI_ATTRFORK so
that we can remap things into the attribute fork.  Eventually the
online repair code will use this to rebuild attribute forks, so make it
non-static.
