staging: ks7010: move and rename DEVICE_ALIGNMENT into correct header

This commit moves DEVICE_ALIGNMENT definition into the header ks_hostif.h
which is where it is being used. This is also defined always so just
remove nosense undef definitions also and clean some preprocessor
conditional directives in hif_align_size function.
