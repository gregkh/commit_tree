fs: clear writeback errors in inode_init_always

In inode_init_always(), we clear the inode mapping flags, which clears
any retained error (AS_EIO, AS_ENOSPC) bits.  Unfortunately, we do not
also clear wb_err, which means that old mapping errors can leak through
to new inodes.

This is crucial for the XFS inode allocation path because we recycle old
in-core inodes and we do not want error state from an old file to leak
into the new file.  This bug was discovered by running generic/036 and
generic/047 in a loop and noticing that the EIOs generated by the
collision of direct and buffered writes in generic/036 would survive the
remount between 036 and 047, and get reported to the fsyncs (on
different files!) in generic/047.
