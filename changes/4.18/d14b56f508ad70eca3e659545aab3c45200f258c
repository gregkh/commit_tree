net: cleanup gfp mask in alloc_skb_with_frags

alloc_skb_with_frags uses __GFP_NORETRY for non-sleeping allocations
which is just a noop and a little bit confusing.

__GFP_NORETRY was added by ed98df3361f0 ("net: use __GFP_NORETRY for
high order allocations") to prevent from the OOM killer. Yet this was
not enough because fb05e7a89f50 ("net: don't wait for order-3 page
allocation") didn't want an excessive reclaim for non-costly orders
so it made it completely NOWAIT while it preserved __GFP_NORETRY in
place which is now redundant.

Drop the pointless __GFP_NORETRY because this function is used as
copy&paste source for other places.
