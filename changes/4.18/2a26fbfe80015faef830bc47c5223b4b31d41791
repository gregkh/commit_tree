drm/amdkfd: Fix goto usage

Missed a spot in previous cleanup commit:
Remove gotos that do not feature any common cleanup, and use gotos
instead of repeating cleanup commands.

According to kernel.org: "The goto statement comes in handy when a
function exits from multiple locations and some common work such as
cleanup has to be done. If there is no cleanup needed then just return
directly."
