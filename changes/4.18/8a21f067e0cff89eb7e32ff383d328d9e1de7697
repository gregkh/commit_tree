crypto: inside-secure - fix the hash then encrypt/decrypt types

This commit fixes the CONTEXT_CONTROL_TYPE_HASH_ENCRYPT_OUT and
CONTEXT_CONTROL_TYPE_HASH_DECRYPT_OUT types by assigning the right
value, and by renaming CONTEXT_CONTROL_TYPE_HASH_DECRYPT_OUT to
CONTEXT_CONTROL_TYPE_HASH_DECRYPT_IN.

This is not submitted as a fix for older kernel versions as these two
defines weren't used back then.
