perf tools: Fix compilation errors on gcc8

We are getting following warnings on gcc8 that break compilation:

  $ make
    CC       jvmti/jvmti_agent.o
  jvmti/jvmti_agent.c: In function ‘jvmti_open’:
  jvmti/jvmti_agent.c:252:35: error: ‘/jit-’ directive output may be truncated \
    writing 5 bytes into a region of size between 1 and 4096 [-Werror=format-truncation=]
    snprintf(dump_path, PATH_MAX, "%s/jit-%i.dump", jit_path, getpid());

There's no point in checking the result of snprintf call in
jvmti_open, the following open call will fail in case the
name is mangled or too long.

Using tools/lib/ function scnprintf that touches the return value from
the snprintf() calls and thus get rid of those warnings.

  $ make DEBUG=1
    CC       arch/x86/util/perf_regs.o
  arch/x86/util/perf_regs.c: In function ‘arch_sdt_arg_parse_op’:
  arch/x86/util/perf_regs.c:229:4: error: ‘strncpy’ output truncated before terminating nul
  copying 2 bytes from a string of the same length [-Werror=stringop-truncation]
    strncpy(prefix, "+0", 2);
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using scnprintf instead of the strncpy (which we know is safe in here)
to get rid of that warning.
