powerpc/eeh: Strengthen types of eeh traversal functions

The traversal functions eeh_pe_traverse() and eeh_pe_dev_traverse()
both provide their first argument as void * but every single user casts
it to the expected type.

Change the type of the first parameter from void * to the appropriate
type, and clean up all uses.
