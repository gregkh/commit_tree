x86/pci-dma: remove the explicit nodac and allowdac option

This is something drivers should decide (modulo chipset quirks like
for VIA), which as far as I can tell is how things have been handled
for the last 15 years.

Note that we keep the usedac option for now, as it is used in the wild
to override the too generic VIA quirk.
