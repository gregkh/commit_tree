dlm: remove O_NONBLOCK flag in sctp_connect_to_sock

We should remove O_NONBLOCK flag when calling sock->ops->connect()
in sctp_connect_to_sock() function.
Why?
1. up to now, sctp socket connect() function ignores the flag argument,
that means O_NONBLOCK flag does not take effect, then we should remove
it to avoid the confusion (but is not urgent).
2. for the future, there will be a patch to fix this problem, then the flag
argument will take effect, the patch has been queued at https://git.kernel.o
rg/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/net/sctp?id=644fbdeacf1d3ed
d366e44b8ba214de9d1dd66a9.
But, the O_NONBLOCK flag will make sock->ops->connect() directly return
without any wait time, then the connection will not be established, DLM kernel
module will call sock->ops->connect() again and again, the bad results are,
CPU usage is almost 100%, even trigger soft_lockup problem if the related
configurations are enabled,
DLM kernel module also prints lots of messages like,
[Fri Apr 27 11:23:43 2018] dlm: connecting to 172167592
[Fri Apr 27 11:23:43 2018] dlm: connecting to 172167592
[Fri Apr 27 11:23:43 2018] dlm: connecting to 172167592
[Fri Apr 27 11:23:43 2018] dlm: connecting to 172167592
The upper application (e.g. ocfs2 mount command) is hanged at new_lockspace(),
the whole backtrace is as below,
tb0307-nd2:~ # cat /proc/2935/stack

So, I think we should remove O_NONBLOCK flag here, since DLM kernel module can
not handle non-block sockect in connect() properly.
