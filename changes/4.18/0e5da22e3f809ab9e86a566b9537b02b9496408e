rcu: Move __rcu_read_lock() and __rcu_read_unlock() to tree_plugin.h

The __rcu_read_lock() and __rcu_read_unlock() functions were moved
to kernel/rcu/update.c in order to implement tiny preemptible RCU.
However, tiny preemptible RCU was removed from the kernel a long time
ago, so this commit belatedly moves them back into the only remaining
preemptible-RCU code.
