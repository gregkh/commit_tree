Btrfs: get rid of unused orphan infrastructure

Now that we don't keep long-standing reservations for orphan items,
root->orphan_block_rsv isn't used. We can git rid of it, along with:

- root->orphan_lock, which was used to protect root->orphan_block_rsv
- root->orphan_inodes, which was used as a refcount for root->orphan_block_rsv
- BTRFS_INODE_ORPHAN_META_RESERVED, which was used to track reservations
  in root->orphan_block_rsv
- btrfs_orphan_commit_root(), which was the last user of any of these
  and does nothing else
