net/ipv6: separate handling of FIB entries from dst based routes

Last step before flipping the data type for FIB entries:
- use fib6_info_alloc to create FIB entries in ip6_route_info_create
  and addrconf_dst_alloc
- use fib6_info_release in place of dst_release, ip6_rt_put and
  rt6_release
- remove the dst_hold before calling __ip6_ins_rt or ip6_del_rt
- when purging routes, drop per-cpu routes
- replace inc and dec of rt6i_ref with fib6_info_hold and fib6_info_release
- use rt->from since it points to the FIB entry
- drop references to exception bucket, fib6_metrics and per-cpu from
  dst entries (those are relevant for fib entries only)
