IB/hfi1: Prevent LNI hang when LCB can't obtain lanes

When the LCB isn't able to get any lanes operational on the
first transition into mission mode, the link transfer active
never happens and the LNI stays in the polling state indefinitely.

Reset LCB upon receiving an 8051 interrupt for LCB to try to obtain
lanes with firmware version 1.25.0 or later. Also, update the LCB
reset value in other parts of the code with a macro defined to make
the code more maintainable and rename functions with the link_width
label to link_mode to reflect the fact that those functions set and
read link related data not just the link width.
