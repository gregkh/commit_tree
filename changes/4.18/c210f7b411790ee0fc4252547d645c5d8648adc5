KEYS: DNS: limit the length of option strings

Adding a dns_resolver key whose payload contains a very long option name
resulted in that string being printed in full.  This hit the WARN_ONCE()
in set_precision() during the printk(), because printk() only supports a
precision of up to 32767 bytes:

    precision 1000000 too large
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 752 at lib/vsprintf.c:2189 vsnprintf+0x4bc/0x5b0

Fix it by limiting option strings (combined name + value) to a much more
reasonable 128 bytes.  The exact limit is arbitrary, but currently the
only recognized option is formatted as "dnserror=%lu" which fits well
within this limit.

Also ratelimit the printks.

Reproducer:

    perl -e 'print "#", "A" x 1000000, "\x00"' | keyctl padd dns_resolver desc @s
