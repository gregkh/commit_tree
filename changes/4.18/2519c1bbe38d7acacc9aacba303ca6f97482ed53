tracing: Quiet gcc warning about maybe unused link variable

Commit 57ea2a34adf4 ("tracing/kprobes: Fix trace_probe flags on
enable_trace_kprobe() failure") added an if statement that depends on another
if statement that gcc doesn't see will initialize the "link" variable and
gives the warning:

 "warning: 'link' may be used uninitialized in this function"

It is really a false positive, but to quiet the warning, and also to make
sure that it never actually is used uninitialized, initialize the "link"
variable to NULL and add an if (!WARN_ON_ONCE(!link)) where the compiler
thinks it could be used uninitialized.
