net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: disable mq feature for "AM33xx ES1.0" devices

The early versions of am33xx devices, related to ES1.0 SoC revision
have errata limiting mq support. That's the same errata as
commit 7da1160002f1 ("drivers: net: cpsw: add am335x errata workarround for
interrutps")

AM33xx Errata [1] Advisory 1.0.9
http://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz360f/sprz360f.pdf

After additional investigation were found that drivers w/a is
propagated on all AM33xx SoCs and on DM814x. But the errata exists
only for ES1.0 of AM33xx family, limiting mq support for revisions
after ES1.0. So, disable mq support only for related SoCs and use
separate polls for revisions allowing mq.
