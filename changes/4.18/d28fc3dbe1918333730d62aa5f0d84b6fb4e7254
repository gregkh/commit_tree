crypto: zstd - Add zstd support

Adds zstd support to crypto and scompress. Only supports the default
level.

Previously we held off on this patch, since there weren't any users.
Now zram is ready for zstd support, but depends on CONFIG_CRYPTO_ZSTD,
which isn't defined until this patch is in. I also see a patch adding
zstd to pstore [0], which depends on crypto zstd.
