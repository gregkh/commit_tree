net: ip6_gre: get ipv6hdr after skb_cow_head()

A KASAN:use-after-free bug was found related to ip6-erspan
while running selftests/net/ip6_gre_headroom.sh

It happens because of following sequence:
- ipv6hdr pointer is obtained from skb
- skb_cow_head() is called, skb->head memory is reallocated
- old data is accessed using ipv6hdr pointer

skb_cow_head() call was added in e41c7c68ea77 ("ip6erspan: make sure
enough headroom at xmit."), but looking at the history there was a
chance of similar bug because gre_handle_offloads() and pskb_trim()
can also reallocate skb->head memory. Fixes tag points to commit
which introduced possibility of this bug.

This patch moves ipv6hdr pointer assignment after skb_cow_head() call.

Fixes: 5a963eb61b7c ("ip6_gre: Add ERSPAN native tunnel support")
