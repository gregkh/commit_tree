drm/i915: Make header i915_pmu.h more robust

Definitions in i915_pmu.h header depend on other types and
declarations that were not explicitly included. Fix that by
adding related headers and forward declarations.
While here, change license text to SPDX format.

v2: don't drop "intel_ringbuffer.h" (Tvrtko)
