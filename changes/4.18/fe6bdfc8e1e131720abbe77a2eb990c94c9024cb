mm: fix oom_kill event handling

Commit e27be240df53 ("mm: memcg: make sure memory.events is uptodate
when waking pollers") converted most of memcg event counters to
per-memcg atomics, which made them less confusing for a user.  The
"oom_kill" counter remained untouched, so now it behaves differently
than other counters (including "oom").  This adds nothing but confusion.

Let's fix this by adding the MEMCG_OOM_KILL event, and follow the
MEMCG_OOM approach.

This also removes a hack from count_memcg_event_mm(), introduced earlier
specially for the OOM_KILL counter.
