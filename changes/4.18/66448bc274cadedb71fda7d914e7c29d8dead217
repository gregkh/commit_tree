workqueue: move function definitions within CONFIG_SMP block

In commit 7ee681b25284 ("workqueue: Convert to state machine callbacks"),
three new function definitions were added: ‘workqueue_prepare_cpu’,
‘workqueue_online_cpu’ and ‘workqueue_offline_cpu’.

Move these function definitions within a CONFIG_SMP block since they are
not used outside of it. This will match function declarations in header
<include/linux/workqueue.h>, and silence the following gcc warning (W=1):

  kernel/workqueue.c:4743:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘workqueue_prepare_cpu’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
  kernel/workqueue.c:4756:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘workqueue_online_cpu’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
  kernel/workqueue.c:4783:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘workqueue_offline_cpu’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
