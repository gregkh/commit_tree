rtlwifi: btcoex: remove identical statements within if-else branches

Since the statements are identical, we can safely remove the statements.
The commit 42e74946f016 ("rtlwifi: btcoexist: Fix if == else warnings in
halbtc8821a1ant.c") had fixed the statements, but the commit c6821613e653
("rtlwifi: btcoex: follow linux coding style") that converted coding style
and upgraded btcoex didn't include the fix.
