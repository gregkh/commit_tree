ARM: dts: imx28/imx53: enable edt-ft5x06 wakeup source

The touchscreen driver no longer configures the device as wakeup source by
default. A "wakeup-source" property is needed.

To avoid regressions, this patch changes the DTS files for the only two
users of this driver that didn't have this property yet.
