scsi: target: transport should handle st FM/EOM/ILI reads

When a tape drive is exported via LIO using the pscsi module, a read
that requests more bytes per block than the tape can supply returns an
empty buffer. This is because the pscsi pass-through target module sees
the "ILI" illegal length bit set and thinks there is no reason to return
the data.

This is a long-standing transport issue, since it assumes that no data
need be returned under a check condition, which isn't always the case
for tape.

Add in a check for tape reads with the ILI, EOM, or FM bits set, with a
sense code of NO_SENSE, treating such cases as if the read
succeeded. The layered tape driver then "does the right thing" when it
gets such a response.
