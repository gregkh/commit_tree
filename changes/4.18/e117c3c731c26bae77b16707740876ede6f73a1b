scsi: cxlflash: Support file descriptor mapping

The cxlflash core fop API requires a way to invoke the fault and release
handlers of underlying transports using their native file-based APIs. This
provides the core with the ability to insert selectively itself into the
processing stream of these operations for cleanup. Implement these two fops to
map and release when requested.
