staging: vt6655: check for memory allocation failures

There are no null pointer checking on rd_info and td_info values which
are allocated by kzalloc. It has potential null pointer dereferencing
issues. Implement error handling code on device_init_rd*, device_init_td*
and vnt_start for the allocation failures.
