nbd: handle unexpected replies better

If the server or network is misbehaving and we get an unexpected reply
we can sometimes miss the request not being started and wait on a
request and never get a response, or even double complete the same
request.  Fix this by replacing the send_complete completion with just a
per command lock.  Add a per command cookie as well so that we can know
if we're getting a double completion for a previous event.  Also check
to make sure we dont have REQUEUED set as that means we raced with the
timeout handler and need to just let the retry occur.
