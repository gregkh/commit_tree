staging: ks7010: change sdio related read/write function parameter types

This commit reviews and changes SDIO related read and write
functions parameter types to use the preferred u* kernel types.
Also length parameter which was defined as int has nonsense
because calls to this functions are called useing an unsigned
instead. Because of this length parameters have been changed
also into unsigned int.
