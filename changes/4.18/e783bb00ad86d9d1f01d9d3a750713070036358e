ipmr: fix error path when ipmr_new_table fails

commit 0bbbf0e7d0e7 ("ipmr, ip6mr: Unite creation of new mr_table")
refactored ipmr_new_table, so that it now returns NULL when
mr_table_alloc fails. Unfortunately, all callers of ipmr_new_table
expect an ERR_PTR.

This can result in NULL deref, for example when ipmr_rules_exit calls
ipmr_free_table with NULL net->ipv4.mrt in the
!CONFIG_IP_MROUTE_MULTIPLE_TABLES version.

This patch makes mr_table_alloc return errors, and changes
ip6mr_new_table and its callers to return/expect error pointers as
well. It also removes the version of mr_table_alloc defined under
!CONFIG_IP_MROUTE_COMMON, since it is never used.
