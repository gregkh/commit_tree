powerpc/64: change softe to irqmask in show_regs and xmon

When the soft enabled flag was changed to a soft disable mask, xmon
and register dump code was not updated to reflect that, which is
confusing ('SOFTE: 1' previously meant interrupts were soft enabled,
currently it means the opposite, the general interrupt type has been
disabled).

Fix this by using the name irqmask, and printing it in hex.
