ARM: 8765/1: smp: Move clear_tasks_mm_cpumask() call to __cpu_die()

Suspending a CPU on a RT kernel results in the following backtrace:

| CPU1: shutdown

The root cause of above backtrace is task_lock() which takes a sleeping
lock on -RT.

To fix the issue, move clear_tasks_mm_cpumask() call from __cpu_disable()
to __cpu_die() which is called on the thread which is asking for a target
CPU to be shutdown. In addition, this change restores CPU hotplug
functionality on ARM CPU1 can be unplugged/plugged many times.
