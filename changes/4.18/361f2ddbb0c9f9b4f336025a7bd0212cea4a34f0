ANDROID: binder: re-order some conditions

It doesn't make any difference to runtime but I've switched these two
checks to make my static checker happy.

The problem is that "buffer->data_size" is user controlled and if it's
less than "sizeo(*hdr)" then that means "offset" can be more than
"buffer->data_size".  It's just cleaner to check it in the other order.
