ALSA: usb-audio: Disable the quirk for Nura headset

The commit 33193dca671c ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add a quirk for Nura's
first gen headset") added a quirk for Nura headset with USB ID
0a12:1243, with a hope that it doesn't conflict with others.
Unfortunately, other devices (e.g. Philips Wecall) with the very same
ID got broken by this change, spewing an error like:
  usb 2-1.8.2: 2:1: cannot set freq 48000 to ep 0x3

Until we find a proper solution, fix the regression at first by
disabling the added quirk entry.
