linvdimm, pmem: Preserve read-only setting for pmem devices

The pmem driver does not honor a forced read-only setting for very long:
	$ blockdev --setro /dev/pmem0
	$ blockdev --getro /dev/pmem0
	1

followed by various commands like these:
	$ blockdev --rereadpt /dev/pmem0
	or
	$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/pmem0

results in this in the kernel serial log:
	 nd_pmem namespace0.0: region0 read-write, marking pmem0 read-write

with the read-only setting lost:
	$ blockdev --getro /dev/pmem0
	0

That's from bus.c nvdimm_revalidate_disk(), which always applies the
setting from nd_region (which is initially based on the ACPI NFIT
NVDIMM state flags not_armed bit).

In contrast, commit 20bd1d026aac ("scsi: sd: Keep disk read-only when
re-reading partition") fixed this issue for SCSI devices to preserve
the previous setting if it was set to read-only.

This patch modifies bus.c to preserve any previous read-only setting.
It also eliminates the kernel serial log print except for cases where
read-write is changed to read-only, so it doesn't print read-only to
read-only non-changes.
