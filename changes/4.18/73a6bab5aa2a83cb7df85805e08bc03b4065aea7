tcp: switch pacing timer to softirq based hrtimer

linux-4.16 got support for softirq based hrtimers.
TCP can switch its pacing hrtimer to this variant, since this
avoids going through a tasklet and some atomic operations.

pacing timer logic looks like other (jiffies based) tcp timers.

v2: use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() in tcp_clear_xmit_timers()
    to correctly release reference on socket if needed.
