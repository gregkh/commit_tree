ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Set card long_name based on quirks

Many X86 devices using a BYT SoC + RT5651 codec are cheap devices with
generic DMI strings, causing snd_soc_set_dmi_name() to fail to set a
long_name, making it impossible for userspace to have a correct UCM
profile which knowns which input is connected to the internal mic,
which input is connected to the hsmic (for correct jack-based switching)
and which inputs are unused.

Our quirks already specify which inputs the internal and headset mic
are connected to.

This commit sets a long_name based on the quirks so that userspace can
have UCM profiles doing the right thing based on the long_name.

Note that if we ever encounter the need for a special UCM profile for
some device we can add a quirk to set a specific long_name for the
device,
