serial/8250: export serial8250_read_char

Currently, we export serial8250_rx_chars, which does a whole bunch of
reads from the 8250 data register, without any form of flow control
between reads.

An upcoming change to the aspeed vuart driver implements more
fine-grained flow control in the interrupt handler, requiring
character-at-a-time control over the rx path.

This change exports serial8250_read_char to allow this.
