MIPS: BCM47XX: Enable 74K Core ExternalSync for PCIe erratum

The erratum and workaround are described by BCM5300X-ES300-RDS.pdf as
below.

  R10: PCIe Transactions Periodically Fail

    Description: The BCM5300X PCIe does not maintain transaction ordering.
                 This may cause PCIe transaction failure.
    Fix Comment: Add a dummy PCIe configuration read after a PCIe
                 configuration write to ensure PCIe configuration access
                 ordering. Set ES bit of CP0 configu7 register to enable
                 sync function so that the sync instruction is functional.
    Resolution:  hndpci.c: extpci_write_config()
                 hndmips.c: si_mips_init()
                 mipsinc.h CONF7_ES

This is fixed by the CFE MIPS bcmsi chipset driver also for BCM47XX.
Also the dummy PCIe configuration read is already implemented in the
Linux BCMA driver.

Enable ExternalSync in Config7 when CONFIG_BCMA_DRIVER_PCI_HOSTMODE=y
too so that the sync instruction is externalised.
