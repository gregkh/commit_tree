powerpc/64s/radix: make ptep_get_and_clear_full non-atomic for the full case

This matches other architectures, when we know there will be no
further accesses to the address (e.g., for teardown), page table
entries can be cleared non-atomically.

The comments about NMMU are bogus: all MMU notifiers (including NMMU)
are released at this point, with their TLBs flushed. An NMMU access at
this point would be a bug.
