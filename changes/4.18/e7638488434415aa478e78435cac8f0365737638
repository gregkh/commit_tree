mm: introduce MEMORY_DEVICE_FS_DAX and CONFIG_DEV_PAGEMAP_OPS

In preparation for fixing dax-dma-vs-unmap issues, filesystems need to
be able to rely on the fact that they will get wakeups on dev_pagemap
page-idle events. Introduce MEMORY_DEVICE_FS_DAX and
generic_dax_page_free() as common indicator / infrastructure for dax
filesytems to require. With this change there are no users of the
MEMORY_DEVICE_HOST designation, so remove it.

The HMM sub-system extended dev_pagemap to arrange a callback when a
dev_pagemap managed page is freed. Since a dev_pagemap page is free /
idle when its reference count is 1 it requires an additional branch to
check the page-type at put_page() time. Given put_page() is a hot-path
we do not want to incur that check if HMM is not in use, so a static
branch is used to avoid that overhead when not necessary.

Now, the FS_DAX implementation wants to reuse this mechanism for
receiving dev_pagemap ->page_free() callbacks. Rework the HMM-specific
static-key into a generic mechanism that either HMM or FS_DAX code paths
can enable.

For ARCH=um builds, and any other arch that lacks ZONE_DEVICE support,
care must be taken to compile out the DEV_PAGEMAP_OPS infrastructure.
However, we still need to support FS_DAX in the FS_DAX_LIMITED case
implemented by the s390/dcssblk driver.
