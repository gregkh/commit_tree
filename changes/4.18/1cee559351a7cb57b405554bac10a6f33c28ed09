ALSA: xen-front: Implement ALSA virtual sound driver

Implement essential initialization of the sound driver:
  - introduce required data structures
  - handle driver registration
  - handle sound card registration
  - register sound driver on backend connection
  - remove sound driver on backend disconnect

Initialize virtual sound card with streams according to the
Xen store configuration.

Implement ALSA driver operations including:
  - manage frontend/backend shared buffers
  - manage Xen bus event channel states

Implement requests from front to back for ALSA
PCM operations.
  - report ALSA period elapsed event: handle XENSND_EVT_CUR_POS
    notifications from the backend when stream position advances
    during playback/capture. The event carries a value of how
    many octets were played/captured at the time of the event.
  - implement explicit stream parameter negotiation between
    backend and frontend: handle XENSND_OP_HW_PARAM_QUERY request
    to read/update configuration space for the parameter given:
    request passes desired parameter interval and the response to
    this request returns min/max interval for the parameter to be used.
