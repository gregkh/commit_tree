xsk: add umem completion queue support and mmap

Here, we add another setsockopt for registered user memory (umem)
called XDP_UMEM_COMPLETION_QUEUE. Using this socket option, the
process can ask the kernel to allocate a queue (ring buffer) and also
mmap it (XDP_UMEM_PGOFF_COMPLETION_QUEUE) into the process.

The queue is used to explicitly pass ownership of umem frames from the
kernel to user process. This will be used by the TX path to tell user
space that a certain frame has been transmitted and user space can use
it for something else, if it wishes.
