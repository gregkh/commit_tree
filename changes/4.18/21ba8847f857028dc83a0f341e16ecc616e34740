netfilter: nf_conncount: Fix garbage collection with zones

Currently, we use check_hlist() for garbage colleciton. However, we
use the ‘zone’ from the counted entry to query the existence of
existing entries in the hlist. This could be wrong when they are in
different zones, and this patch fixes this issue.
