drm/amd/display: release spinlock before committing updates to stream

Currently, amdgpu_do_flip() spinlocks crtc->dev->event_lock and
releases it only after committing updates to the stream.

dc_commit_updates_for_stream() should be moved out of
spinlock for the below reasons:

1. event_lock is supposed to protect access to acrct->pflip_status _only_
2. dc_commit_updates_for_stream() has potential sleep's
   and also its not appropriate to be  in an atomic state
   for such long sequences of code.
