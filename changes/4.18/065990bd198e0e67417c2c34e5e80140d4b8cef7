scsi: set timed out out mq requests to complete

The scsi block layer requires requests claimed by the error handling be
completed by the error handler. A previous commit allowed completions
to proceed for blk-mq, breaking that assumption.

This patch prevents completions that may race with the timeout handler
by marking the state to complete, restoring the previous behavior.
