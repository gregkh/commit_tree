ARM: dts: r7s72100: add soc node

Add soc node to represent the bus and move all nodes with a base address
into this node. This is consistent with handling of R-Car Gen3 and Gen2
SoCs in mainline. It is intended to migrate other Renesas ARM-based
SoCs to this scheme.

The ordering is derived from simply moving each node with an address up to
before any nodes without a base address that occur before the soc node.  To
improve maintainability follow-up patches will sort subnodes of both the
new soc node and the root node.

This patch should not introduce any functional change.
