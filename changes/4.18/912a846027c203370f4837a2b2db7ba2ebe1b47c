staging: lustre: replace libcfs_register_ioctl with a blocking notifier_chain

libcfs allows other modules to register handlers for ioctls.
The implementation it uses for this is nearly identical to a
blocking notifier chain, so change to use that.

The biggest difference is that the return value from notifier has a
defined format, where libcfs_register_ioctl uses -EINVAL to mean
"continue".  This requires a little bit of conversion.
