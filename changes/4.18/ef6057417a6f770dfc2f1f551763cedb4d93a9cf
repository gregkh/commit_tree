tools/power turbostat: Calculate additional node information for a package

The code currently assumes each package has exactly one node.  This is not
the case for AMD systems and Intel systems with COD.  AMD systems also
may re-enumerate each node's core IDs starting at 0 (for example, an AMD
processor may have two nodes, each with core IDs from 0 to 7).  In order
to properly enumerate the cores we need to track both the physical and
logical node IDs.

Add physical_node_id to track the node ID assigned by the kernel, and
logical_node_id used by turbostat to track the nodes per package ie) a
0-based count within the package.
