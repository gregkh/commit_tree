regulator: tps65090: Pass descriptor instead of GPIO number

Instead of passing a global GPIO number for the enable GPIO, pass
a descriptor looked up from the device tree node for the
regulator.

This regulator supports passing platform data, but enable/sleep
regulators are looked up from the device tree exclusively, so
we can need not touch other files.
