ASoC: dai playback and capture active may be greater than 1

At the moment playback_active and capture_active are using only 1 bit so
the maximum active count is 1.

However, snd_soc_runtime_activate() may be called several time on the
same dai. This happens when a dai is part of several dai_links. It is
often the case for "snd-soc-dummy-dai".

This is a problem if snd_soc_runtime_activate() is called an even number
of times on a dai. In this case the active count overflow back to 0. As
consequence, ASoC functions, such as soc_dpcm_runtime_update(), won't run
correctly.

Storing these usage counts on plain 'unsigned int' solves the problem.
