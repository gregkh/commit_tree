xen/privcmd: add IOCTL_PRIVCMD_MMAP_RESOURCE

My recent Xen patch series introduces a new HYPERVISOR_memory_op to
support direct priv-mapping of certain guest resources (such as ioreq
pages, used by emulators) by a tools domain, rather than having to access
such resources via the guest P2M.

This patch adds the necessary infrastructure to the privcmd driver and
Xen MMU code to support direct resource mapping.

NOTE: The adjustment in the MMU code is partially cosmetic. Xen will now
      allow a PV tools domain to map guest pages either by GFN or MFN, thus
      the term 'mfn' has been swapped for 'pfn' in the lower layers of the
      remap code.
