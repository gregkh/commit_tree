rtc: ensure rtc_set_alarm fails when alarms are not supported

When using RTC_ALM_SET or RTC_WKALM_SET with rtc_wkalrm.enabled not set,
rtc_timer_enqueue() is not called and rtc_set_alarm() may succeed but the
subsequent RTC_AIE_ON ioctl will fail. RTC_ALM_READ would also fail in that
case.

Ensure rtc_set_alarm() fails when alarms are not supported to avoid letting
programs think the alarms are working for a particular RTC when they are
not.
