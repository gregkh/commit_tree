drm: rcar-du: of: Include header to define prototypes

The symbol 'rcar_du_of_init' is defined by the rcar_du_of module header,
but it is not included by the C implementation.

Include the header to correctly define the function prototypes.

Fixes the following warning:

linux/drivers/gpu/drm/rcar-du/rcar_du_of.c:319:13:
   warning: symbol 'rcar_du_of_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
    CC      drivers/gpu/drm/rcar-du/rcar_du_of.o
