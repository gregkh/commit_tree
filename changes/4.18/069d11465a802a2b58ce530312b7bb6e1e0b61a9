net/mlx5e: RX, Enhance legacy Receive Queue memory scheme

Enhance the memory scheme of the legacy RQ, such that
only order-0 pages are used.

Whenever possible, prefer using a linear SKB, and build it
wrapping the WQE buffer.

Otherwise (for example, jumbo frames on x86), use non-linear SKB,
with as many frags as needed. In this case, multiple WQE
scatter entries are used, up to a maximum of 4 frags and 10KB of MTU.

This implied to remove support of HW LRO in legacy RQ, as it would
require large number of page allocations and scatter entries per WQE
on archs with PAGE_SIZE = 4KB, yielding bad performance.

In earlier patches, we guaranteed that all completions are in-order,
and that we use a cyclic WQ.
This creates an oppurtunity for a performance optimization:
The mapping between a "struct mlx5e_dma_info", and the
WQEs (struct mlx5e_wqe_frag_info) pointing to it, is constant
across different cycles of a WQ. This allows initializing
the mapping in the time of RQ creation, and not handle it
in datapath.

A struct mlx5e_dma_info that is shared between different WQEs
is allocated by the first WQE, and freed by the last one.
This implies an important requirement: WQEs that share the same
struct mlx5e_dma_info must be posted within the same NAPI.
Otherwise, upon completion, struct mlx5e_wqe_frag_info would mistakenly
point to the new struct mlx5e_dma_info, not the one that was posted
(and the HW wrote to).
This bulking requirement is actually good also for performance reasons,
hence we extend the bulk beyong the minimal requirement above.

With this memory scheme, the RQs memory footprint is reduce by a
factor of 2 on x86, and by a factor of 32 on PowerPC.
Same factors apply for the number of pages in a GRO session.

Performance tests:
ConnectX-4, single core, single RX ring, default MTU.

x86:
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz

Packet rate (early drop in TC): no degradation
TCP streams: ~5% improvement

PowerPC:
CPU: POWER8 (raw), altivec supported

Packet rate (early drop in TC): 20% gain
TCP streams: 25% gain
