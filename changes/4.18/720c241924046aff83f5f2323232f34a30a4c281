ANDROID: binder: change down_write to down_read

binder_update_page_range needs down_write of mmap_sem because
vm_insert_page need to change vma->vm_flags to VM_MIXEDMAP unless
it is set. However, when I profile binder working, it seems
every binder buffers should be mapped in advance by binder_mmap.
It means we could set VM_MIXEDMAP in binder_mmap time which is
already hold a mmap_sem as down_write so binder_update_page_range
doesn't need to hold a mmap_sem as down_write.
Please use proper API down_read. It would help mmap_sem contention
problem as well as fixing down_write abuse.

Ganesh Mahendran tested app launching and binder throughput test
and he said he couldn't find any problem and I did binder latency
test per Greg KH request(Thanks Martijn to teach me how I can do)
I cannot find any problem, too.
