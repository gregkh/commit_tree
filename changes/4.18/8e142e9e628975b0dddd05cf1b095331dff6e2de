ALSA: hda/ca0132: fix build failure when a local macro is defined

DECLARE_TLV_DB_SCALE (alias of SNDRV_CTL_TLVD_DECLARE_DB_SCALE) is used but
tlv.h is not included. This causes build failure when local macro is
defined by comment-out.

This commit fixes the bug. At the same time, the alias macro is replaced
with a destination macro added at a commit 46e860f76804 ("ALSA: rename
TLV-related macros so that they're friendly to user applications")
