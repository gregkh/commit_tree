Revert "powerpc/powernv: Increase memory block size to 1GB on radix"

This commit was a stop-gap to prevent crashes on hotunplug, caused by
the mismatch between the 1G mappings used for the linear mapping and the
memory block size. Those issues are now resolved because we split the
linear mapping at hotunplug time if necessary, as implemented in commit
4dd5f8a99e79 ("powerpc/mm/radix: Split linear mapping on hot-unplug").
