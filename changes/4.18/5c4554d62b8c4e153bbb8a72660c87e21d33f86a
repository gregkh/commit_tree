dt-bindings: rtc: update stm32-rtc documentation for stm32mp1 rtc

RTC embedded in stm32mp1 SoC is slightly different from stm32h7 one, it
doesn't require to disable backup domain write protection, and rtc_ck
parent clock assignment isn't allowed.
To sum up, stm32mp1 RTC requires 2 clocks, pclk and rtc_ck, and an RTC
alarm interrupt.
