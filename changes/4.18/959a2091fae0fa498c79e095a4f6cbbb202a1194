drm/amdgpu: Add support to change mtype for 2nd part of gart BOs on GFX9

This change prepares for a workaround in amdkfd for a GFX9 HW bug. It
requires the control stack memory of compute queues, which is allocated
from the second page of MQD gart BOs, to have mtype NC, rather than
the default UC.
