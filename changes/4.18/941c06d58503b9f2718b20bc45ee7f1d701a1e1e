powerpc/mm/32: Fix pgtable_page_dtor call

Commit 667416f38554 ("powerpc/mm: Fix kernel crash on page table free")
added a call for pgtable_page_dtor in the rcu page table free routine. We missed
the fact that for 32 bit platforms we did call the 'dtor' early. Drop the extra
call for pgtable_page_dtor. We remove the call from __pte_free_tlb so that we
do the page table free and 'dtor' call together. This should help when we
switch these platforms to pte fragments.
