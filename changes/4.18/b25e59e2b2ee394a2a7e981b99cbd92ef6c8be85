btrfs: drop uuid_mutex in btrfs_dev_replace_finishing

btrfs_dev_replace_finishing updates devices (soruce and target) which
are within the btrfs_fs_devices::devices or withint the cloned seed
devices (btrfs_fs_devices::seed::devices), so we don't need the global
uuid_mutex.

The device replace context is also locked by its own locks.
