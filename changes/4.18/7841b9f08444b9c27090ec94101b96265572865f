gfs2: hole_size improvement

Reimplement function hole_size based on a generic function for walking
the metadata tree and rename hole_size to gfs2_hole_size.  While
previously, multiple invocations of hole_size were sometimes needed to
walk across the entire hole, the new implementation always returns the
entire hole at once (provided that the caller is interested in the total
size).
