cpufreq: tegra20: Wrap cpufreq into platform driver

Currently tegra20-cpufreq kernel module isn't getting autoloaded because
there is no device associated with the module, this is one of two patches
that resolves the module autoloading. This patch adds a module alias that
will associate the tegra20-cpufreq kernel module with the platform device,
other patch will instantiate the actual platform device. And now it makes
sense to wrap cpufreq driver into a platform driver for consistency.
