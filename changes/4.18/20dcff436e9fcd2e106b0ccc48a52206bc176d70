serial: 8250_pci: Remove stalled entries in blacklist

After the commit

  7d8905d06405 ("serial: 8250_pci: Enable device after we check black list")

pure serial multi-port cards, such as CH355, got blacklisted and thus
not being enumerated anymore. Previously, it seems, blacklisting them
was on purpose to shut up pciserial_init_one() about record duplication.

So, remove the entries from blacklist in order to get cards enumerated.
