xfs: add full xfs_dqblk verifier

Add an xfs_dqblk verifier so that it can check the uuid on V5 filesystems;
it calls the existing xfs_dquot_verify verifier to validate the
xfs_disk_dquot_t contained inside it.  This lets us move the uuid
verification out of the crc verifier, which makes little sense.
