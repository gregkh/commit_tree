media: omap3isp: support 64-bit version of omap3isp_stat_data

C libraries with 64-bit time_t use an incompatible format for
struct omap3isp_stat_data. This changes the kernel code to
support either version, by moving over the normal handling
to the 64-bit variant, and adding compatiblity code to handle
the old binary format with the existing ioctl command code.

Fortunately, the command code includes the size of the structure,
so the difference gets handled automatically. In the process of
eliminating the references to 'struct timeval' from the kernel,
I also change the way the timestamp is generated internally,
basically by open-coding the v4l2_get_timestamp() call.
