mmc: sdhci-omap: Get IODelay values for 3.3v DDR mode

commit 8d20b2eae6c47b095523 ("mmc: sdhci_omap: Add support to set
IODELAY values") stored IODelay values for all MM/SD modes
in pinctrl_state structure member of sdhci_omap_host. However for
DDR mode it gets IODelay values only for 1.8v DDR mode. Since some of
the platforms which uses sdhci-omap has IO lines connected to 3.3v,
get IODelay values for 3.3v DDR mode.
