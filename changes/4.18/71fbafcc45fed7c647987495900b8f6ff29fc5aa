i2c: qup: Correct duty cycle for FM and FM+

The I2C spec UM10204 Rev. 6 specifies the following timings.

           Standard      Fast Mode     Fast Mode Plus
SCL low    4.7us         1.3us         0.5us
SCL high   4.0us         0.6us         0.26us

This results in a 33%/66% duty cycle as opposed to the 50%/50% duty cycle
used for Standard-mode.

Add High Time Divider settings to correct duty cycle for FM(400kHz) and
FM+(1MHz).
