Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Remove irq-active-low DMI quirk for the Thinkpad 8

Interrupts specified through an "Interrupt" ACPI resource (versus through
a "GpioInt" resource) are now always assumed to be active low.

When this change was originally made the Thinkpad 8 quirk was kept around
because it was uncertain if the Thinkpad 8 uses an "Interrupt" or a
"GpioInt" resource.

Bug https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196701 has a DSDT for the
Thinkpad 8 attached and it uses an "Interrupt" resource, so the quirk is
not necessary and the quirk, as well as the irq-active-low quirk handling
code can be removed.
