drm/i915: Add NV12 as supported format for sprite plane

This patch adds NV12 to list of supported formats for sprite plane.

- Removed skl_plane_formats_with_nv12 and added
NV12 case in existing skl_plane_formats
- Added the 10bpc RGB formats

"Why are we adding 10 bit RGB formats with the NV12 series patches?
Trying to set XR30 or AB30 results in error returned even though
the modes are advertised for the planes"
- Removed 10bit RGB formats added previously with NV12 series

v5: Missed the Tested-by/Reviewed-by in the previous series
Adding the same to commit message in this version.
