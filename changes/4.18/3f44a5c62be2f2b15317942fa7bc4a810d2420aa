tools/power turbostat: add --enable Time_Of_Day_Seconds

Add a Time_Of_Day_Seconds column showing when measurement
for each row was completed.  Units are [sec.subsec] since Epoch,
as reported by gettimeofday(2).

While useful to correlate turbostat output with other tools,
this built-in column is disabled, by default.

Add the "--enable" option to enable such disabled-by-default
built-in columns:

"--enable Time_Of_Day_Seconds"
"--enable usec"

"--enable all", will enable all disabled-by-defauilt built-in counters.

When "--debug" is used, all disabled-by-default columns are enabled,
unless explicitly skipped using "--hide"
