arm64: dts: stratix10: use clock bindings for the Stratix10 platform

Use the clock bindings for the Stratix10 SoC. This includes changing the old
binding of "intc,clk-s10-mgr" to "intel,stratix10-clkmgr". The reason that
this can be done is that there are currently no clock driver for Stratix10,
thus there are no consumers of the old binding. So changing the binding will
not break any legacy code.
