net/ipv6: fix metrics leak

Since commit d4ead6b34b67 ("net/ipv6: move metrics from dst to
rt6_info"), ipv6 metrics are shared and refcounted. rt6_set_from()
assigns the rt->from pointer and increases the refcount on from's
metrics. This reference is never released.

Introduce the fib6_metrics_release() helper and use it to release the
metrics.
