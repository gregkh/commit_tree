ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add quirks for various devices

Even with our recently tweaked defaults, quite a few bytcr_rt5640 devices
still need quirks to be fully functional. This commits adds quirks where
necessary for the 16 bytcr_rt5640 devices I have access to.

The quirks are added for the following reasons:

1) Devices with only one speaker need the mono quirk to avoid driving an
unused and potentially short-circuited output. 8 of my sample of 16 devs
are mono, 4 of these would work with the defaults if it were not for their
mono speaker.

2) Devices using a different input for the internal mic then the default,
this is the case for 6 of my sample of 16 devices.

3) BYTCR devices without an ACPI channel map, which do not work with the
default of SSP0-AIF2, this is the case for 2 of my sample of 16 devices.

4) Devices which need non-default jack-detect settings, this is the case
for 6 of my sample of 16 devices.
