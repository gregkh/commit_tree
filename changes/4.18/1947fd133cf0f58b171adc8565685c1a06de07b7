drm/i915: Don't initialize plane_to_crtc_mapping[] on SKL+

We don't use the enum i9xx_plane_id namespace on SKL+ anymore, so
do not initialize the related plane_to_crtc_mapping[] table either.

Actually the only remaining user of that table is the pre-g4x
watermark code, but no harm in initializing the table on all
pre-SKL platforms.
