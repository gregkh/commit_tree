IB/hfi1: Return actual error value from program_rcvarray()

A failure of program_rcvarray() is treated inconsistently by the
calling function.  In one case the error is returned, in a second
case, the error is overwritten with EFAULT.  In both cases the
code path is doing the same thing, allocating memory for groups,
so it should be consistent.

Make the error path consistent and return the error generated by
program_rcvarray().
