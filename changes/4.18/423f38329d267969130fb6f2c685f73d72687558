xsk: add umem fill queue support and mmap

Here, we add another setsockopt for registered user memory (umem)
called XDP_UMEM_FILL_QUEUE. Using this socket option, the process can
ask the kernel to allocate a queue (ring buffer) and also mmap it
(XDP_UMEM_PGOFF_FILL_QUEUE) into the process.

The queue is used to explicitly pass ownership of umem frames from the
user process to the kernel. These frames will in a later patch be
filled in with Rx packet data by the kernel.

v2: Fixed potential crash in xsk_mmap.
