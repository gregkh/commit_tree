rtc: stm32: add stm32mp1 rtc support

This patch adds support for stm32mp1 RTC.
Some common registers with previous RTC version have a different offset.
It is the case for Control Register (CR) and ALaRMA Register (ALRMAR).
There are also new registers regarding event flags: now, Alarm event flag
is in Status Register (SR) and write 1 in Status Clear Register (SCR) is
required to clear the event.
