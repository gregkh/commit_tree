memory: tegra: Apply interrupts mask per SoC

Currently we are enabling handling of interrupts specific to Tegra124+
which happen to overlap with previous generations. Let's specify
interrupts mask per SoC generation for consistency and in a preparation
of squashing of Tegra20 driver into the common one that will enable
handling of GART faults which may be undesirable by newer generations.
