spi: sh-msiof: Simplify calculation of divisors for transfer rate

The change updates sh_msiof_spi_set_clk_regs() function by iterating
over BRDV power values. Note that the change is a functional one, namely
prescaler output x 1/1 set in BRDV bit field (0b111) for MSO division
rate set to 2 is substituted by BRDV = 0b000 and BRPS = 0b0, in terms
of written values to TSCR setting of 0x0107 is substituted by 0x0000,
and for all input parameter cases this is the only functional change,
which touches the controller.

As a result of the rework the function is supposed to be slightly more
efficient and more readable and maintainable in case of any further
extensions.
