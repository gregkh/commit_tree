video/omap: add module license tags

I got a bunch of warnings in a randconfig build:

WARNING: modpost: missing MODULE_LICENSE() in drivers/video/fbdev/omap/lcd_ams_delta.o
WARNING: modpost: missing MODULE_LICENSE() in drivers/video/fbdev/omap/lcd_inn1510.o
WARNING: modpost: missing MODULE_LICENSE() in drivers/video/fbdev/omap/lcd_palmte.o
WARNING: modpost: missing MODULE_LICENSE() in drivers/video/fbdev/omap/lcd_palmtt.o

These come from an earlier patch of mine that turned all display drivers
into separate modules. The fix is to add a MODULE_LICENSE tag. Since I'm
doing that, adding a description and author field also makes sense. I
went by the authors listed in the comment at the top of each file, but
removed Imre's Nokia email address that I assume is not valid any more,
since Imre is working at Intel these days.
