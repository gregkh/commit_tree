btrfs: Refactor btrfs_check_super_valid

Refactor btrfs_check_super_valid:

1) Rename it to btrfs_validate_mount_super()
   Now it's more obvious when the function should be called.

2) Extract core check routine into validate_super()
   Later write time check can reuse it, and if needed, we could also
   use validate_super() to check each super block.

3) Add more comments about btrfs_validate_mount_super()
   Mostly about what it doesn't check and when it should be called.
