perf/x86/intel: Fix unwind errors from PEBS entries (mk-II)

Vince reported the perf_fuzzer giving various unwinder warnings and
Josh reported:

And where the previous unwinder only needed BP,SP ORC also requires
IP. But we cannot spoof IP because then the sample will get displaced,
entirely negating the point of PEBS.

So cure the whole thing differently by doing the unwind early; this
does however require a means to communicate we did the unwind early.
We (ab)use an unused sample_type bit for this, which we set on events
that fill out the data->callchain before the normal
perf_prepare_sample().
