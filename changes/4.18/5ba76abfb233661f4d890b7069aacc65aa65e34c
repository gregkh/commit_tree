btrfs: rename check_flags to reflect which flags it touches

The FS_*_FL flags cannot be easily identified by a prefix but we still
need to recognize them so the 'fsflags' should be closer to the naming
scheme but again the 'fs' part sounds like it's a filesystem flag. I
don't have a better idea for now.
