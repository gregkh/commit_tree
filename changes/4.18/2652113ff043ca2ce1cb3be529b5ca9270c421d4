net: ethernet: ti: Allow most drivers with COMPILE_TEST

Most of the TI drivers build just fine with COMPILE_TEST, cpmac (AR7) is
the exception because it uses a header file from
arch/mips/include/asm/mach-ar7/ar7.h and keystone netcp which requires
help from drivers/soc/ti/ for queue management helpers.
