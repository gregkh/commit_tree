ata: Fix ZBC_OUT command block check

The block (LBA) specified must not exceed the last addressable LBA,
which is dev->nr_sectors - 1. So fix the correct check is
"if (block >= dev->n_sectors)" and not "if (block > dev->n_sectords)".

Additionally, the asc/ascq to return for an LBA that is not a zone start
LBA should be ILLEGAL REQUEST, regardless if the bad LBA is out of
range.
