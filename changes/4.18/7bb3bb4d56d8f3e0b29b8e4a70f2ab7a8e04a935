drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Split the platform-specific poweron in two parts

Some of the platform-specific stuff in rockchip_dp_poweron() needs to
happen before the generic code.  Some needs to happen after.  Let's
split the callback in two.

Specifically we can't start doing PSR work until _after_ the whole
controller is up, so don't set the enable until the end.
