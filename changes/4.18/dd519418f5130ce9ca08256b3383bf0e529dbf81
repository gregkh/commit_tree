drm/i915/dp: move link_bw and rate_select debugging where used

We call intel_dp_compute_rate() in intel_dp_compute_config() only to be
able to debug log the link_bw and rate_select parameters; we don't use
the parameters here for anything else. We call intel_dp_compute_rate()
again during link training where we actually need and use the
parameters.

Move the debug logging of link_bw and rate_select to
intel_dp_link_training_clock_recovery(), and clean up the extra
intel_dp_compute_rate() call and extra clutter from the already
overcrowded intel_dp_compute_config().
