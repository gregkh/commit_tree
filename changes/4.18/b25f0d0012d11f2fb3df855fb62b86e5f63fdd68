btrfs: Use while loop instead of labels in __endio_write_update_ordered

Currently __endio_write_update_ordered uses labels to implement
what is essentially a simple while loop. This makes the code more
cumbersome to follow than it actually has to be. No functional
changes. No xfstest regressions were found during testing.
