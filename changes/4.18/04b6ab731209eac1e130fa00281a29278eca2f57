selftests/bpf: Selftest for sys_sendmsg hooks

Add selftest for BPF_CGROUP_UDP4_SENDMSG and BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG
attach types.

Try to sendmsg(2) to specific IP:port and test that:
* source IP is overridden as expected.
* remote IP:port pair is overridden as expected;

Both UDPv4 and UDPv6 are tested.

Output:
  # test_sock_addr.sh 2>/dev/null
  Wait for testing IPv4/IPv6 to become available ... OK
  ... pre-existing test-cases skipped ...
