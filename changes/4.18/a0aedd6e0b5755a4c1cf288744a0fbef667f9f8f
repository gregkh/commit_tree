ath10k: build ce layer in ath10k core module

CE layer is shared between pci and snoc target and results
in duplicate object inclusion if both modules are compiled
together statically and undefined KBUILD_MODNAME if
compiled as module.

Fix this by building ce layer in ath10k core module by
adding ce object inclusion with ATH10K_CE boolean CONFIG.
