perf bench: Fix numa report output code

Currently we can hit following assert when running numa bench:

  $ perf bench numa mem -p 3 -t 1 -P 512 -s 100 -zZ0cm --thp 1
  perf: bench/numa.c:1577: __bench_numa: Assertion `!(!(((wait_stat) & 0x7f) == 0))' failed.

The assertion is correct, because we hit the SIGFPE in following line:

  Thread 2.2 "thread 0/0" received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
  [Switching to Thread 0x7fffd28c6700 (LWP 11750)]
  0x000.. in worker_thread (__tdata=0x7.. ) at bench/numa.c:1257
  1257 td->speed_gbs = bytes_done / (td->runtime_ns / NSEC_PER_SEC) / 1e9;

We don't check if the runtime is actually bigger than 1 second,
and thus this might end up with zero division within FPU.

Adding the check to prevent this.
