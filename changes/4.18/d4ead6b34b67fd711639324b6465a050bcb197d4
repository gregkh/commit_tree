net/ipv6: move metrics from dst to rt6_info

Similar to IPv4, add fib metrics to the fib struct, which at the moment
is rt6_info. Will be moved to fib6_info in a later patch. Copy metrics
into dst by reference using refcount.

To make the transition:
- add dst_metrics to rt6_info. Default to dst_default_metrics if no
  metrics are passed during route add. No need for a separate pmtu
  entry; it can reference the MTU slot in fib6_metrics

- ip6_convert_metrics allocates memory in the FIB entry and uses
  ip_metrics_convert to copy from netlink attribute to metrics entry

- the convert metrics call is done in ip6_route_info_create simplifying
  the route add path
  + fib6_commit_metrics and fib6_copy_metrics and the temporary
    mx6_config are no longer needed

- add fib6_metric_set helper to change the value of a metric in the
  fib entry since dst_metric_set can no longer be used

- cow_metrics for IPv6 can drop to dst_cow_metrics_generic

- rt6_dst_from_metrics_check is no longer needed

- rt6_fill_node needs the FIB entry and dst as separate arguments to
  keep compatibility with existing output. Current dst address is
  renamed to dest.
  (to be consistent with IPv4 rt6_fill_node really should be split
  into 2 functions similar to fib_dump_info and rt_fill_info)

- rt6_fill_node no longer needs the temporary metrics variable
