net-next/hinic: fix a problem in hinic_xmit_frame()

The calculation of "wqe_size" is not correct when the tx queue is busy in
hinic_xmit_frame().

When there are no free WQEs, the tx flow will unmap the skb buffer, then
ring the doobell for the pending packets. But the "wqe_size" which used
to calculate the doorbell address is not correct. The wqe size should be
cleared to 0, otherwise, it will cause a doorbell error.

This patch fixes the problem.
