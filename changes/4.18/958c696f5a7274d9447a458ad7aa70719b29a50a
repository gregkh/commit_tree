net/mlx4_core: Save the qpn from the input modifier in RST2INIT wrapper

Function mlx4_RST2INIT_QP_wrapper saved the qp number passed in the qp
context, rather than the one passed in the input modifier.

However, the qp number in the qp context is not defined as a
required parameter by the FW. Therefore, drivers may choose to not
specify the qp number in the qp context for the reset-to-init transition.

Thus, we must save the qp number passed in the command input modifier --
which is always present. (This saved qp number is used as the input
modifier for command 2RST_QP when a slave's qp's are destroyed).
