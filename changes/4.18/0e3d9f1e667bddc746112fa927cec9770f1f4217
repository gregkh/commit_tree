signal/sparc: Use send_sig_fault where appropriate

Filling in struct siginfo before calling send_sig_info a tedious and
error prone process, where once in a great while the wrong fields
are filled out, and siginfo has been inconsistently cleared.

Simplify this process by using the helper send_sig_fault.  Which
takes as a parameters all of the information it needs, ensures
all of the fiddly bits of filling in struct siginfo are done properly
and then calls send_sig_info.

In short about a 5 line reduction in code for every time send_sig_info
is called, which makes the calling function clearer.
