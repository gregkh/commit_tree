uio: change to use the mutex lock instead of the spin lock

We are hitting a regression with the following commit:

    uio: Prevent device destruction while fds are open

The problem is the addition of spin_lock_irqsave in uio_write. This
leads to hitting  uio_write -> copy_from_user -> _copy_from_user ->
might_fault and the logs filling up with sleeping warnings.

I also noticed some uio drivers allocate memory, sleep, grab mutexes
from callouts like open() and release and uio is now doing
spin_lock_irqsave while calling them.
