Btrfs: allow empty subvol= again

I got a report that after upgrading to 4.16, someone's filesystems
weren't mounting:

[   23.845852] BTRFS info (device loop0): unrecognized mount option 'subvol='

Before 4.16, this mounted the default subvolume. It turns out that this
empty "subvol=" is actually an application bug, but it was causing the
application to fail, so it's an ABI break if you squint.

The generic parsing code we use for mount options (match_token())
doesn't match an empty string as "%s". Previously, setup_root_args()
removed the "subvol=" string, but the mount path was cleaned up to not
need that. Add a dummy Opt_subvol_empty to fix this.

The simple workaround is to use / or . for the value of 'subvol=' .
