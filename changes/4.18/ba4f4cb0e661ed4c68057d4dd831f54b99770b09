KVM: arm64: Remove redundant *exit_code changes in fpsimd_guest_exit()

In fixup_guest_exit(), there are a couple of cases where after
checking what the exit code was, we assign it explicitly with the
value it already had.

Assuming this is not indicative of a bug, these assignments are not
needed.

This patch removes the redundant assignments, and simplifies some
if-nesting that becomes trivial as a result.

No functional change.
