scsi: hisi_sas: check IPTT is valid before using it for v3 hw

There is a bug of v3 hw development version. When AXI error happen, hw
may return an abnormal CQ that IPTT value is 0xffff.  This will cause
IPTT out-of-bounds reference.

This patch adds a check of IPTT in cq_tasklet_v3_hw() and discards
invalid slot. This workaround scheme is just to enhance fault-tolerance
of the driver. So, we will apply this scheme for all version of v3 hw,
although release version has fixed this SoC bug.
