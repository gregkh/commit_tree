nvme-pci: move nvme_kill_queues to nvme_remove_dead_ctrl

There is race between nvme_remove and nvme_reset_work that can
lead to io hang.

nvme_remove                    nvme_reset_work
                               -> nvme_remove_dead_ctrl
                                 -> nvme_dev_disable
                                   -> quiesce request_queue
                                 -> queue remove_work
-> cancel_work_sync reset_work
-> nvme_remove_namespaces
  -> splice ctrl->namespaces
                               nvme_remove_dead_ctrl_work
                               -> nvme_kill_queues
  -> nvme_ns_remove               do nothing
    -> blk_cleanup_queue
      -> blk_freeze_queue

Finally, the request_queue is quiesced state when wait freeze,
we will get io hang here. To fix it, move the nvme_kill_queues
from nvme_remove_dead_ctrl_work to nvme_remove_dead_ctrl.
