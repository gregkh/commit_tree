crypto: testmgr - add extra ecb(des) encryption test vectors

Two "ecb(des)" decryption test vectors don't exactly match any of the
encryption test vectors with input and result swapped.  In preparation
for removing the decryption test vectors, add these to the encryption
test vectors, so we don't lose any test coverage.
