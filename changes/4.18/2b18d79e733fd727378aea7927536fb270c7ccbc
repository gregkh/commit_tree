net: bridge: Allow bridge master in br_vlan_get_info()

Mirroring offload in mlxsw needs to check that a given VLAN is allowed
to ingress the bridge device. br_vlan_get_info() is the function that is
used for this, however currently it only supports bridge port devices.
Extend it to support bridge masters as well.
