scsi: zfcp: zfcp_erp_action_exists() does only check for running

Simplify its signature to return boolean and rename it to
zfcp_erp_action_is_running() to indicate its actual unmodified semantics.
It has always been used like this since v2.6.0 history commit ea127f975424
("[PATCH] s390 (7/7): zfcp host adapter.").
