scsi: ufs: Use freq table with devfreq

devfreq requires that the client operates on actual frequencies, not only 0
and UMAX_INT and as such UFS brok with the introduction of f1d981eaecf8 ("PM
/ devfreq: Use the available min/max frequency").

This patch registers the frequencies of the first clock with devfreq and use
these to determine if we're trying to step up or down.
