PCI: pciehp: Clear Presence Detect and Data Link Layer Status Changed on resume

After a suspend/resume cycle the Presence Detect or Data Link Layer Status
Changed bits might be set.  If we don't clear them those events will not
fire anymore and nothing happens for instance when a device is now
hot-unplugged.

Fix this by clearing those bits in a newly introduced function
pcie_reenable_notification().  This should be fine because immediately
after, we check if the adapter is still present by reading directly from
the status register.
