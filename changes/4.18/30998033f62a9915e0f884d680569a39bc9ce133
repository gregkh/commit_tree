ACPI / PPTT: use ACPI ID whenever ACPI_PPTT_ACPI_PROCESSOR_ID_VALID is set

Currently, we use the ACPI processor ID only for the leaf/processor nodes
as the specification states it must match the value of the ACPI processor
ID field in the processorâ€™s entry in the MADT.

However, if a PPTT structure represents a processors group, it
matches a processor container UID in the namespace and the
ACPI_PPTT_ACPI_PROCESSOR_ID_VALID flag indicates whether the
ACPI processor ID is valid.

Let's use UID whenever ACPI_PPTT_ACPI_PROCESSOR_ID_VALID is set to be
consistent instead of using table offset as it's currently done for
non-leaf nodes.
