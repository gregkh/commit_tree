scsi: st: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in st_probe

st_probe() is never called in atomic context. st_probe() is only set as
".probe" in struct scsi_driver.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, st_probe() calls
kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC, which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL, which
can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
