time: Introduce CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME

Compat functions are now used to support 32 bit time_t in
compat mode on 64 bit architectures and in native mode on
32 bit architectures.

Introduce COMPAT_32BIT_TIME to conditionally compile these
functions.

Note that turning off 32 bit time_t support requires more
changes on architecture side. For instance, architecure
syscall tables need to be updated to drop support for 32 bit
time_t syscalls.
