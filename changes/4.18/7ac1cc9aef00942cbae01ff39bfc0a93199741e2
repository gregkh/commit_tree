devlink: don't take instance lock around eswitch mode set

Changing switch mode may want to register and unregister devlink
ports.  Therefore similarly to DEVLINK_CMD_PORT_SPLIT/UNSPLIT it
should not take the instance lock.  Drivers don't depend on existing
locking since it's a very recent addition.
