aio: implement io_pgetevents

This is the io_getevents equivalent of ppoll/pselect and allows to
properly mix signals and aio completions (especially with IOCB_CMD_POLL)
and atomically executes the following sequence:

	sigset_t origmask;

	pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask);
	ret = io_getevents(ctx, min_nr, nr, events, timeout);
	pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL);

Note that unlike many other signal related calls we do not pass a sigmask
size, as that would get us to 7 arguments, which aren't easily supported
by the syscall infrastructure.  It seems a lot less painful to just add a
new syscall variant in the unlikely case we're going to increase the
sigset size.
