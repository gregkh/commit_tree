lightnvm: pblk: only try to recover lines with written smeta

When switching between different lun configurations, there is no
guarantee that all lines that contain closed/open chunks have some
valid data to recover.

Check that the smeta chunk has been written to instead. Also
skip bad lines (that does not have enough good chunks).
