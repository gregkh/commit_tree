netfilter: nf_tables: add connlimit support

This features which allows you to limit the maximum number of
connections per arbitrary key. The connlimit expression is stateful,
therefore it can be used from meters to dynamically populate a set, this
provides a mapping to the iptables' connlimit match. This patch also
comes that allows you define static connlimit policies.

This extension depends on the nf_conncount infrastructure.
