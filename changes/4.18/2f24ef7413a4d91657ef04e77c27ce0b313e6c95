ARC: Enable machine_desc->init_per_cpu for !CONFIG_SMP

machine_desc->init_per_cpu() hook is supposed to be per cpu
initialization and would seem to apply  equally to UP and/or SMP.
Infact the comment in header file seems to suggest it works for
UP too, which was not the case and this patch.

This enables !CONFIG_SMP build for platforms such as hsdk.
