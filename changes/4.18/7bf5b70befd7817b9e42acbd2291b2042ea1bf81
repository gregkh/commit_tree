drm/nouveau/secboot: remove VLA usage

In preparation to enabling -Wvla, remove VLA. In this particular
case directly use macro NVKM_MSGQUEUE_CMDLINE_SIZE instead of local
variable cmdline_size. Also, remove cmdline_size as it is not
actually useful anymore.

The use of stack Variable Length Arrays needs to be avoided, as they
can be a vector for stack exhaustion, which can be both a runtime bug
or a security flaw. Also, in general, as code evolves it is easy to
lose track of how big a VLA can get. Thus, we can end up having runtime
failures that are hard to debug.

Also, fixed as part of the directive to remove all VLAs from
the kernel: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/7/621
