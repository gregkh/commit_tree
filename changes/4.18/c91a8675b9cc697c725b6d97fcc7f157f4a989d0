rcu: Add accessor macros for the ->need_future_gp[] array

Accessors for the ->need_future_gp[] array are currently open-coded,
which makes them difficult to change.  To improve maintainability, this
commit adds need_future_gp_mask() to compute the indexing mask from the
array size, need_future_gp_element() to access the element corresponding
to the specified grace-period number, and need_any_future_gp() to
determine if any future grace period is needed.  This commit also applies
need_future_gp_element() to existing open-coded single-element accesses.
