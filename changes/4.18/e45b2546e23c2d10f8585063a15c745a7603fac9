fuse: Ensure posix acls are translated outside of init_user_ns

Ensure the translation happens by failing to read or write
posix acls when the filesystem has not indicated it supports
posix acls.

This ensures that modern cached posix acl support is available
and used when dealing with posix acls.  This is important
because only that path has the code to convernt the uids and
gids in posix acls into the user namespace of a fuse filesystem.
