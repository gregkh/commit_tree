powerpc/powernv: Fix save/restore of SPRG3 on entry/exit from stop (idle)

On 64-bit servers, SPRN_SPRG3 and its userspace read-only mirror
SPRN_USPRG3 are used as userspace VDSO write and read registers
respectively.

SPRN_SPRG3 is lost when we enter stop4 and above, and is currently not
restored.  As a result, any read from SPRN_USPRG3 returns zero on an
exit from stop4 (Power9 only) and above.

Thus in this situation, on POWER9, any call from sched_getcpu() always
returns zero, as on powerpc, we call __kernel_getcpu() which relies
upon SPRN_USPRG3 to report the CPU and NUMA node information.

Fix this by restoring SPRN_SPRG3 on wake up from a deep stop state
with the sprg_vdso value that is cached in PACA.
