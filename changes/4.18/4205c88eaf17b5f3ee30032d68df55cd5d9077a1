net: stmmac: Set DMA buffer size in HW

This is clearly a bug.

We need to set the DMA buffer size in the HW otherwise corruption can
occur when receiving packets.

This is probably not occuring because of small MTU values and because HW
has a default value internally (which currently is bigger than default
buffer size).
