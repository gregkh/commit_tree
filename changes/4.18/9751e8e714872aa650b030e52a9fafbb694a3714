bnxt_en: reduce timeout on initial HWRM calls

Testing with DIM enabled on older kernels indicated that firmware calls
were slower than expected.  More detailed analysis indicated that the
default 25us delay was higher than necessary.  Reducing the time spend in
usleep_range() for the first several calls would reduce the overall
latency of firmware calls on newer Intel processors.
