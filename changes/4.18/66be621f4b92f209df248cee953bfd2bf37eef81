HID: quirks: remove Delcom Visual Signal Indicator from hid_have_special_driver[]

Delcom offers different types of products sharing the same USB VID/PID
as the Visual Signal Indicator. Other products need to be handled by
HID Generic what's not possible currently because USB VID/PID are
listed in hid_have_special_driver[].

After e04a0442d33b ("HID: core: remove the absolute need of
hid_have_special_driver[]") we can now remove the Delcom entry.

If a Visual Signal Indicator device is plugged-in, HID core
will start a reprobe if hid-led driver is available.
If another device with same USB VID/PID is plugged-in, then hid-led
can be blacklisted and HID Generic handles the device.

Thanks to Delcom for providing test devices.
