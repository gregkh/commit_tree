x86/dumpstack: Remove code_bytes

This was added by

  86c418374223 ("[PATCH] i386: add option to show more code in oops reports")

long time ago but experience shows that 64 instruction bytes are plenty
when deciphering an oops. So get rid of it.

Removing it will simplify further enhancements to the opcodes dumping
machinery coming in the following patches.
