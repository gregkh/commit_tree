btrfs: Factor out write portion of btrfs_get_blocks_direct

Now that the read side is extracted into its own function, do the same
to the write side. This leaves btrfs_get_blocks_direct_write with the
sole purpose of handling common locking required. Also flip the
condition in btrfs_get_blocks_direct_write so that the write case
comes first and we check for if (Create) rather than if (!create). This
is purely subjective but I believe makes reading a bit more "linear".
No functional changes.
