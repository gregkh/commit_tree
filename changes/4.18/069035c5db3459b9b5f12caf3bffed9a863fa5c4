drm: Fix possible race conditions while unplugging DRM device

When unplugging a hotpluggable DRM device we first unregister it
with drm_dev_unregister and then set drm_device.unplugged flag which
is used to mark device critical sections with drm_dev_enter()/
drm_dev_exit() preventing access to device resources that are not
available after the device is gone.
But drm_dev_unregister may lead to hotplug uevent(s) fired to
user-space on card and/or connector removal, thus making it possible
for user-space to try accessing a disconnected device.

Fix this by first making sure device is properly marked as
disconnected and only then unregister it.
