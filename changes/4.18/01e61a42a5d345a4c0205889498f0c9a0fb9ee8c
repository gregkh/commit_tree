cpufreq: intel_pstate: Limit the scope of HWP dynamic boost platforms

Dynamic boosting of HWP performance on IO wake showed significant
improvement to IO workloads. This series was intended for Skylake Xeon
platforms only and feature was enabled by default based on CPU model
number.

But some Xeon platforms reused the Skylake desktop CPU model number. This
caused some undesirable side effects to some graphics workloads. Since
they are heavily IO bound, the increase in CPU performance decreased the
power available for GPU to do its computing and hence decrease in graphics
benchmark performance.

For example on a Skylake desktop, GpuTest benchmark showed average FPS
reduction from 529 to 506.

This change makes sure that HWP boost feature is only enabled for Skylake
server platforms by using ACPI FADT preferred PM Profile. If some desktop
users wants to get benefit of boost, they can still enable boost from
intel_pstate sysfs attribute "hwp_dynamic_boost".
