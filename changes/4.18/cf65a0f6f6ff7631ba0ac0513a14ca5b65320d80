dma-mapping: move all DMA mapping code to kernel/dma

Currently the code is split over various files with dma- prefixes in the
lib/ and drives/base directories, and the number of files keeps growing.
Move them into a single directory to keep the code together and remove
the file name prefixes.  To match the irq infrastructure this directory
is placed under the kernel/ directory.
