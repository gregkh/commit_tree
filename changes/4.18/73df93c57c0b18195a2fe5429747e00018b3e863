tools/bpftool: fix a bug in bpftool perf

Commit b04df400c302 ("tools/bpftool: add perf subcommand")
introduced bpftool subcommand perf to query bpf program
kuprobe and tracepoint attachments.

The perf subcommand will first test whether bpf subcommand
BPF_TASK_FD_QUERY is supported in kernel or not. It does it
by opening a file with argv[0] and feeds the file descriptor
and current task pid to the kernel for querying.

Such an approach won't work if the argv[0] cannot be opened
successfully in the current directory. This is especially
true when bpftool is accessible through PATH env variable.
The error below reflects the open failure for file argv[0]
at home directory.

  [yhs@localhost ~]$ which bpftool
  /usr/local/sbin/bpftool
  [yhs@localhost ~]$ bpftool perf
  Error: perf_query_support: No such file or directory

To fix the issue, let us open root directory ("/")
which exists in every linux system. With the fix, the
error message will correctly reflect the permission issue.

  [yhs@localhost ~]$ which bpftool
  /usr/local/sbin/bpftool
  [yhs@localhost ~]$ bpftool perf
  Error: perf_query_support: Operation not permitted
  HINT: non root or kernel doesn't support TASK_FD_QUERY
