Revert "ixgbe: release lock for the duration of ixgbe_suspend_close()"

This reverts commit 6710f970d9979d8f03f6e292bb729b2ee1526d0e.

Gotta love when developers have offline discussions, thinking everyone
is reading their responses/dialog.

The change had the potential for a number of race conditions on
shutdown, which is why we are reverting the change.
