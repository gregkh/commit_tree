xsk: fix poll/POLLIN premature returns

Polling for the ingress queues relies on reading the producer/consumer
pointers of the Rx queue.

Prior this commit, a cached consumer pointer could be used, instead of
the actual consumer pointer and therefore report POLLIN prematurely.

This patch makes sure that the non-cached consumer pointer is used
instead.
