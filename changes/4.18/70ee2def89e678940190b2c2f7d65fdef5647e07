drm/amd/display: Check dc_sink every time in MST hotplug

Extended fix to: "Don't read EDID in atomic_check"

Fix issue of missing dc_sink in .mode_valid in hot plug routine.

Need to check dc_sink everytime in .get_modes hook after checking
edid, since edid is not getting removed in hot unplug but dc_sink
doesn't.
