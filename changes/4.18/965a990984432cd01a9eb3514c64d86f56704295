xsk: add support for bind for Rx

Here, the bind syscall is added. Binding an AF_XDP socket, means
associating the socket to an umem, a netdev and a queue index. This
can be done in two ways.

The first way, creating a "socket from scratch". Create the umem using
the XDP_UMEM_REG setsockopt and an associated fill queue with
XDP_UMEM_FILL_QUEUE. Create the Rx queue using the XDP_RX_QUEUE
setsockopt. Call bind passing ifindex and queue index ("channel" in
ethtool speak).

The second way to bind a socket, is simply skipping the
umem/netdev/queue index, and passing another already setup AF_XDP
socket. The new socket will then have the same umem/netdev/queue index
as the parent so it will share the same umem. You must also set the
flags field in the socket address to XDP_SHARED_UMEM.

v2: Use PTR_ERR instead of passing error variable explicitly.
