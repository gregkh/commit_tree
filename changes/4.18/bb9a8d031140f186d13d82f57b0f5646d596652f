nfp: flower: monitor and offload LAG groups

Monitor LAG events via the NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER/NETDEV_CHANGELOWERSTATE
notifiers to maintain a list of offloadable groups. Sync these groups with
HW via a delayed workqueue to prevent excessive re-configuration. When the
workqueue is triggered it may generate multiple control messages for
different groups. These messages are linked via a batch ID and flags to
indicate a new batch and the end of a batch.

Update private data in each repr to track their LAG lower state flags. The
state of a repr is used to determine the active netdevs that can be
offloaded. For example, in active-backup mode, we only offload the netdev
currently active.
