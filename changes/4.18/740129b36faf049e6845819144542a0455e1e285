MIPS: Use generic GCC library routines from lib/

The commit b35cd9884fa5 ("lib: Add shared copies of some GCC library
routines") makes it possible to share generic GCC library routines by
several architectures.

This commit removes several generic GCC library routines from
arch/mips/lib/ in favour of similar routines from lib/.
