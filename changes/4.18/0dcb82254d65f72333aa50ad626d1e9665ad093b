llc: use refcount_inc_not_zero() for llc_sap_find()

llc_sap_put() decreases the refcnt before deleting sap
from the global list. Therefore, there is a chance
llc_sap_find() could find a sap with zero refcnt
in this global list.

Close this race condition by checking if refcnt is zero
or not in llc_sap_find(), if it is zero then it is being
removed so we can just treat it as gone.
