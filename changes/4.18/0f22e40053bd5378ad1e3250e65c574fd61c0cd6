iwlwifi: pcie: fix race in Rx buffer allocator

Make sure the rx_allocator worker is canceled before running the
rx_init routine.  rx_init frees and re-allocates all rxb's pages.  The
rx_allocator worker also allocates pages for the used rxb's.  Running
rx_init and rx_allocator simultaniously causes a kernel panic.  Fix
that by canceling the work in rx_init.
