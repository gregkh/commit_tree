skbuff: Unconditionally copy pfmemalloc in __skb_clone()

Commit 8b7008620b84 ("net: Don't copy pfmemalloc flag in
__copy_skb_header()") introduced a different handling for the
pfmemalloc flag in copy and clone paths.

In __skb_clone(), now, the flag is set only if it was set in the
original skb, but not cleared if it wasn't. This is wrong and
might lead to socket buffers being flagged with pfmemalloc even
if the skb data wasn't allocated from pfmemalloc reserves. Copy
the flag instead of ORing it.
