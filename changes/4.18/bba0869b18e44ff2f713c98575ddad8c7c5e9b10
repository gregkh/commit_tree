drm/i915: Treat i915_reset_engine() as guilty until proven innocent

If we are resetting just one engine, we know it has stalled. So we can
pass the stalled parameter directly to i915_gem_reset_engine(), which
alleviates the necessity to poke at the generic engine->hangcheck.stalled
magic variable, leaving that under control of hangcheck as its name
implies. Other than simplifying by removing the indirect parameter along
this path, this allows us to introduce new reset mechanisms that run
independently of hangcheck.
