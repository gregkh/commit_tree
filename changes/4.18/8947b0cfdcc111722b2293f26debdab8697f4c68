HID: wacom: Support "in range" for Intuos/Bamboo tablets where possible

The 1st-generation Intuos tablets (CTL-X80) include an "in range" flag
like some professional tablets. To ensure the pen remains usable at as
large as distance as possible (and to preemptively disable touch when
it is nearby) we need to ensure that we handle these "in range" events.
Handling of tool type identification has been moved to occur only when
the pen is fully in prox rather than any time the "stylus_in_proximity"
flag changes (which is controlled by the further-out "in range" flag).
