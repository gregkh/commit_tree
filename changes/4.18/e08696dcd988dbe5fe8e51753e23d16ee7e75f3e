i40e: update data pointer directly when copying to the buffer

A future patch is going to add a helper function i40e_add_ethtool_stats
that will help lower the amount of boiler plate code in the
i40e_get_ethtool_stats function.

This conversion will take place over many patches, and the helper
function will work by directly updating a reference to the data pointer.

Since this would not work combined with the current method of accessing
data like an array, update all the code that copies stats into the data
buffer to use direct updates to the pointer instead of array accesses.

This will prevent incorrect stat updates for patches in between the
conversion.

Similarly, when copying strings, we used a separate char *p pointer.
Instead, use the data pointer directly as it's already a (u8 *) type
which is the same size.
