powerpc/perf: Update raw-event code encoding comment for power8

Comment explanning the raw event code encoding for Power8 was
moved to isa207_common.h file when re-factoring the code to
support power9. But then Power9 pmu branched out due to changes
specific to power9. So move the encoding comment back to power8-pmu.c
Just comment movement and no logic change.
