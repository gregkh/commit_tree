perf c2c: Keep struct hist_entry at the end of struct c2c_hist_entry

Exactly as the comment just before 'struct c2c_hist_entry" says, i.e.
the last entry in struct hist_entry is a zero length array, that when
allocating space for hist_entry gets extra space if callchains are in
use, which, if hist_entry is not at the end of c2c_hist_entry, the
members after it gets corrupted when callchains get added to the rb
trees collecting them, etc.
