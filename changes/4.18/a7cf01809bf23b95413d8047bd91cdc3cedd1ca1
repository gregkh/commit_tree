drm/nouveau/fifo/gk104-: require explicit runlist selection for channel allocation

We didn't used to be aware that runlist/engine IDs weren't the same thing,
or that there was such variability in configuration between GPUs.

By exposing this information to a client, and giving it explicit control
of which runlist it's allocating a channel on, we're able to make better
choices.

The immediate effect of this is that on GPUs where CE0 is the "GRCE", we
will now be allocating a copy engine running asynchronously to GR for BO
migrations - as intended.
