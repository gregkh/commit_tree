ext4: mark inode bitmap corrupted when found

There are still some cases that we missed to set
block bitmaps corrupted bit properly:

1)inode bitmap number is wrong.
2)failed to read block bitmap due to disk errors.
3)double allocations from bitmap

Also remove a duplicated call ext4_error() afer
ext4_read_inode_bitmap(), as ext4_error() have been
called inside ext4_read_inode_bitmap() properly.
