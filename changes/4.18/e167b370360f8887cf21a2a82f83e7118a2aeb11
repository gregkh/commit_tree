staging: lustre: lu_object: discard extra lru count.

lu_object maintains 2 lru counts.
One is a per-bucket lsb_lru_len.
The other is the per-cpu ls_lru_len_counter.

The only times the per-bucket counters are use are:
- a debug message when an object is added
- in lu_site_stats_get when all the counters are combined.

The debug message is not essential, and the per-cpu counter
can be used to get the combined total.

So discard the per-bucket lsb_lru_len.
