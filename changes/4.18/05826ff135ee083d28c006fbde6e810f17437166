usb: typec: wcove: Remove dependency on HW FSM

The USB Type-C PHY in Intel WhiskeyCove PMIC has build-in
USB Type-C state machine which we were relying on to
configure the CC lines correctly. This patch removes that
dependency and configures the CC line according to commands
from the port manager (tcpm.c) in wcove_set_cc().

This fixes an issue where USB devices attached to the USB
Type-C port do not get enumerated. When acting as
source/host, the HW FSM sometimes fails to configure the PHY
correctly.
