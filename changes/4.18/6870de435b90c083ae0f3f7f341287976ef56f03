bpf: make virtio compatible w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail

w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail helper xdp's data_end pointer could be changed as
well (only "decrease" of pointer's location is going to be supported).
changing of this pointer will change packet's size.
for virtio driver we need to adjust XDP_PASS handling by recalculating
length of the packet if it was passed to the TCP/IP stack
