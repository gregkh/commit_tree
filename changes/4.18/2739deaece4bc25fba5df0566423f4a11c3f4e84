staging: vc04_services: remove odd vchiq_debugfs_top() wrapper

vchiq_debugfs_top() is only a wrapper around a pointer to a dentry, so
just use the dentry directly instead, making it a static variable
instead of part of a static structure.

This also removes the pointless BUG_ON() when checking that dentry as no
one should ever care if debugfs is working or not, and the kernel should
really not panic over something as trivial as that.
