scsi: ufs: Add clock ungating to a separate workqueue

UFS driver can receive a request during memory reclaim by kswapd.  So
when ufs driver puts the ungate work in queue, and if there are no idle
workers, kthreadd is invoked to create a new kworker. Since kswapd task
holds a mutex which kthreadd also needs, this can cause a deadlock
situation. So ungate work must be done in a separate work queue with
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag enabled.  Such a workqueue will have a rescue thread
which will be called when the above deadlock condition is possible.
