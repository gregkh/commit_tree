bpf: make sure to clear unused fields in tunnel/xfrm state fetch

Since the remaining bits are not filled in struct bpf_tunnel_key
resp. struct bpf_xfrm_state and originate from uninitialized stack
space, we should make sure to clear them before handing control
back to the program.

Also add a padding element to struct bpf_xfrm_state for future use
similar as we have in struct bpf_tunnel_key and clear it as well.

  struct bpf_xfrm_state {
      __u32                      reqid;            /*     0     4 */
      __u32                      spi;              /*     4     4 */
      __u16                      family;           /*     8     2 */

      /* XXX 2 bytes hole, try to pack */

      union {
          __u32              remote_ipv4;          /*           4 */
          __u32              remote_ipv6[4];       /*          16 */
      };                                           /*    12    16 */

      /* size: 28, cachelines: 1, members: 4 */
      /* sum members: 26, holes: 1, sum holes: 2 */
      /* last cacheline: 28 bytes */
  };
