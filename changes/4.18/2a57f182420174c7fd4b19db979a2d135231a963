tipc: fix wrong return value from function tipc_node_try_addr()

The function for checking if there is an node address conflict is
supposed to return a suggestion for a new address if it finds a
conflict, and zero otherwise. But in case the peer being checked
is previously unknown it does instead return a "suggestion" for
the checked address itself. This results in a DSC_TRIAL_FAIL_MSG
being sent unecessarily to the peer, and sometimes makes the trial
period starting over again.
