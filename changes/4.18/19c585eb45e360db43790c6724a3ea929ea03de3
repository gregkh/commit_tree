KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Restore NV regs after emulating mfspr from TM SPRs

Currently kvmppc_handle_fac() will not update NV GPRs and thus it can
return with GUEST_RESUME.

However PR KVM guest always disables MSR_TM bit in privileged state.
If PR privileged-state guest is trying to read TM SPRs, it will
trigger TM facility unavailable exception and fall into
kvmppc_handle_fac().  Then the emulation will be done by
kvmppc_core_emulate_mfspr_pr().  The mfspr instruction can include a
RT with NV reg. So it is necessary to restore NV GPRs at this case, to
reflect the update to NV RT.

This patch make kvmppc_handle_fac() return GUEST_RESUME_NV for TM
facility unavailable exceptions in guest privileged state.
