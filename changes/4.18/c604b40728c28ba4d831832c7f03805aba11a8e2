lib/test_printf: Mark big constant with UL

Sparse complains that constant is so big for unsigned long on 64-bit
architecture.

lib/test_printf.c:217:54: warning: constant 0xffff0123456789ab is so big it is unsigned long
lib/test_printf.c:246:54: warning: constant 0xffff0123456789ab is so big it is unsigned long

To satisfy everyone, mark the constant with UL.
