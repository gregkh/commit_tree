CIFS: Fix signing for SMB2/3

It seems Ronnie's preamble removal broke signing.

the signing functions are called when:

A) we send a request (to sign it)
B) when we recv a response (to check the signature).

On code path A, the smb2 header is in iov[1] but on code path B, the
smb2 header is in iov[0] (and there's only one vector).

So we have different iov indexes for the smb2 header but the signing
function always use index 1. Fix this by checking the nb of io vectors
in the signing function as a hint.
