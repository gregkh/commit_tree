drm/i915/guc: Split relay control and GuC log level

Those two concepts are really separate. Since GuC is writing data into
its own buffer and we even provide a way for userspace to read directly
from it using i915_guc_log_dump debugfs, there's no real reason to tie
log level with relay creation.
Let's create a separate debugfs, giving userspace a way to create a
relay on demand, when it wants to read a continuous log rather than a
snapshot.

v2: Don't touch guc_log_level on relay creation error, adjust locking
    after rebase, s/dev_priv/i915, pass guc to file->private_data (Sagar)
    Use struct_mutex rather than runtime.lock for set_log_level
v3: Tidy ordering of definitions (Sagar)
