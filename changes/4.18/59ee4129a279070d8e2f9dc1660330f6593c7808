bpf: fix ldx in ld_abs rewrite for large offsets

Mark reported that syzkaller triggered a KASAN detected slab-out-of-bounds
bug in ___bpf_prog_run() with a BPF_LD | BPF_ABS word load at offset 0x8001.
After further investigation it became clear that the issue was the
BPF_LDX_MEM() which takes offset as an argument whereas it cannot encode
larger than S16_MAX offsets into it. For this synthetical case we need to
move the full address into tmp register instead and do the LDX without
immediate value.
