KVM: s390: introduce defines for control registers

In KVM code we use masks to test/set control registers.

Let's define the ones we use in arch/s390/include/asm/ctl_reg.h and
replace all occurrences in KVM code.

As we will be needing the define for Clock-comparator sign control soon,
let's also add it.
