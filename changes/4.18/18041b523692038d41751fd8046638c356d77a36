r8169: restore previous behavior to accept BIOS WoL settings

Commit 7edf6d314cd0 tried to resolve an inconsistency (BIOS WoL
settings are accepted, but device isn't wakeup-enabled) resulting
from a previous broken-BIOS workaround by making disabled WoL the
default.
This however had some side effects, most likely due to a broken BIOS
some systems don't properly resume from suspend when the MagicPacket
WoL bit isn't set in the chip, see
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200195
Therefore restore the WoL behavior from 4.16.
