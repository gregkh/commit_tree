vfio: ccw: refactor and improve pfn_array_alloc_pin()

This refactors pfn_array_alloc_pin() and also improves it by adding
defensive code in error handling so that calling pfn_array_unpin_free()
after error return won't lead to problem. This mainly does:
1. Merge pfn_array_pin() into pfn_array_alloc_pin(), since there is no
   other user of pfn_array_pin(). As a result, also remove kernel-doc
   for pfn_array_pin() and add/update kernel-doc for pfn_array_alloc_pin()
   and struct pfn_array.
2. For a vfio_pin_pages() failure, set pa->pa_nr to zero to indicate
   zero pages were pinned.
3. Set pa->pa_iova_pfn to NULL right after it was freed.
