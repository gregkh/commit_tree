serial: 8250_of: Add IO space support

Currently the 8250_of driver only supports MEM IO type
accesses.

Some development boards (Huawei D03, specifically) require
IO space access for 8250-compatible OF driver support, so
add it.

The modification is quite simple: just set the port iotype
and associated flags depending on the device address
resource type.
