iio: afe: rescale: new driver

If an ADC channel measures the midpoint of a voltage divider, the
interesting voltage is often the voltage over the full resistance.
E.g. if the full voltage is too big for the ADC to handle.
Likewise, if an ADC channel measures the voltage across a shunt
resistor, with or without amplification, the interesting value is
often the current through the resistor.

This driver solves these problems by allowing to linearly scale a channel
and/or by allowing changes to the type of the channel.
