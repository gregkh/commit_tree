NFSv4: Fix _nfs4_do_setlk()

The patch to fix the case where a lock request was interrupted ended up
changing default handling of errors such as NFS4ERR_DENIED and caused the
client to immediately resend the lock request. Let's do a partial revert
of that request so that the default is now to exit, but change the way
we handle resends to take into account the fact that the user may have
interrupted the request.
