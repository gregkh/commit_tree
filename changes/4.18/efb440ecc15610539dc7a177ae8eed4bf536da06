power: supply: axp288_charger: Do not bind when the charge function is not used

Some devices with an AXP288 PMIC do not have a battery at all, or use
external charger and fuelgauge ICs instead of the AXP288 builtin
functionality.

On such devices we should not bind to the charge function to avoid
exporting a non working power_supply class device.
