net: socionext: reset hardware in ndo_stop

When the interface is down, head/tail of the descriptor
ring address is set to 0 in netsec_netdev_stop().
But netsec hardware still keeps the previous descriptor
ring address, so there is inconsistency between driver
and hardware after interface is up at a later time.
To address this inconsistency, add netsec_reset_hardware()
when the interface is down.

In addition, to minimize the reset process,
add flag to decide whether driver loads the netsec microcode.
Even if driver resets the netsec hardware, netsec microcode
keeps resident on RAM, so it is ok we only load the microcode
at initialization.

This patch is critical for installation over network.
