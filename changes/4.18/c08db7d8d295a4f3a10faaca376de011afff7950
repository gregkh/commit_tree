Btrfs: don't return ino to ino cache if inode item removal fails

In btrfs_evict_inode(), if btrfs_truncate_inode_items() fails, the inode
item will still be in the tree but we still return the ino to the ino
cache. That will blow up later when someone tries to allocate that ino,
so don't return it to the cache.
