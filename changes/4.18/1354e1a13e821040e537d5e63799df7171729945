btrfs: use mutex in btrfs_resume_balance_async

While the spinlock does not cause problems, using the mutex is more
correct and consistent with others. The global status of balance is eg.
checked from btrfs_pause_balance or btrfs_cancel_balance with mutex.

Resuming balance happens during mount or ro->rw remount. In the former
case, no other user of the balance_ctl exists, in the latter, balance
cannot run until the ro/rw transition is finished.
