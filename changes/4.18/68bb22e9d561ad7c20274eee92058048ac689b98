PCI: Initialize endpoint library before controllers

The endpoint library must be initialized before its users, which are in
drivers/pci/controllers.  The endpoint initialization currently depends on
link order.

This corrects a kernel crash when loading the Cadence EP driver, since it
calls devm_pci_epc_create() and this is only valid once the endpoint
library has been initialized.
