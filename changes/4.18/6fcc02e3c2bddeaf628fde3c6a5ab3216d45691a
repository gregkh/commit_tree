ipvs: fix check on xmit to non-local addresses

There is mistake in the rt_mode_allow_non_local assignment.
It should be used to check if sending to non-local addresses is
allowed, now it checks if local addresses are allowed.

As local addresses are allowed for most of the cases, the only
places that are affected are for traffic to transparent cache
servers:

- bypass connections when cache server is not available
- related ICMP in FORWARD hook when sent to cache server
