media: rcar-vin: update bytesperline and sizeimage calculation

Remove over complicated logic to calculate the value for bytesperline
and sizeimage that was carried over from the soc_camera port. There is
no need to find the max value of bytesperline and sizeimage from
user-space as they are set to 0 before the max_t() operation.
