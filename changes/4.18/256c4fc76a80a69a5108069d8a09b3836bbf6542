mtd: rawnand: add a way to pass an ID table with nand_scan()

As part of the work of migrating all the drivers to nand_scan(), and
because nand_scan() does not provide a way to pass an ID table, rename
the function nand_scan_with_ids() and add a third parameter to give a
flash ID table (like what was done with nand_scan_ident()).

Create a nand_scan() helper that is just a wrapper of
nand_scan_with_ids(), passing NULL as the ID table. This way a
controller drivers can continue using nand_scan() transparently.
