erspan: set bso bit based on mirrored packet's len

Before the patch, the erspan BSO bit (Bad/Short/Oversized) is not
handled.  BSO has 4 possible values:
  00 --> Good frame with no error, or unknown integrity
  11 --> Payload is a Bad Frame with CRC or Alignment Error
  01 --> Payload is a Short Frame
  10 --> Payload is an Oversized Frame

Based the short/oversized definitions in RFC1757, the patch sets
the bso bit based on the mirrored packet's size.
