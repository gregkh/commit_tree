bpf, x32: Fix regression caused by commit 24dea04767e6

Commit 24dea04767e6 ("bpf, x32: remove ld_abs/ld_ind")
removed the 4 /* Extra space for skb_copy_bits buffer */
from _STACK_SIZE, but it didn't fix the concerned code
in emit_prologue and emit_epilogue, and this error will
bring very strange kernel runtime errors. This patch
fixes it.
