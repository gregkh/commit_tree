sched/core: Distinguish between idle_cpu() calls based on desired effect, introduce available_idle_cpu()

In the following commit:

  247f2f6f3c70 ("sched/core: Don't schedule threads on pre-empted vCPUs")

... we distinguish between idle_cpu() when the vCPU is not running for
scheduling threads.

However, the idle_cpu() function is used in other places for
actually checking whether the state of the CPU is idle or not.

Hence split the use of that function based on the desired return value,
by introducing the available_idle_cpu() function.

This fixes a (slight) regression in that initial vCPU commit, because
some code paths (like the load-balancer) don't care and shouldn't care
if the vCPU is preempted or not, they just want to know if there's any
tasks on the CPU.
