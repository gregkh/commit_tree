sctp: introduce sctp_mtu_payload

When given a MTU, this function calculates how much payload we can carry
on it. Without a MTU, it calculates the amount of header overhead we
have.

So that when we have extra overhead, like the one added for IP options
on SELinux patches, it is easier to handle it.
