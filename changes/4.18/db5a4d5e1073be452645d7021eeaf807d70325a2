wil6210: fix potential null dereference of ndev before null check

The pointer ndev is being dereferenced before it is being null checked,
hence there is a potential null pointer deference. Fix this by only
dereferencing ndev after it has been null checked

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1467010 ("Dereference before null check")
