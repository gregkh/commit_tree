aio: don't expose __aio_sigset in uapi

glibc uses a different defintion of sigset_t than the kernel does,
and the current version would pull in both.  To fix this just do not
expose the type at all - this somewhat mirrors pselect() where we
do not even have a type for the magic sigmask argument, but just
use pointer arithmetics.
