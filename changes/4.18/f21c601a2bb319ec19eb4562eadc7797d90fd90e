dm: use bio_split() when splitting out the already processed bio

Use of bio_clone_bioset() is inefficient if there is no need to clone
the original bio's bio_vec array.  Best to use the bio_clone_fast()
variant.  Also, just using bio_advance() is only part of what is needed
to properly setup the clone -- it doesn't account for the various
bio_integrity() related work that also needs to be performed (see
bio_split).

Address both of these issues by switching from bio_clone_bioset() to
bio_split().

Fixes: 18a25da8 ("dm: ensure bio submission follows a depth-first tree walk")
