qed: Limit msix vectors in kdump kernel to the minimum required count.

Memory size is limited in the kdump kernel environment. Allocation of more
msix-vectors (or queues) consumes few tens of MBs of memory, which might
lead to the kdump kernel failure.
This patch adds changes to limit the number of MSI-X vectors in kdump
kernel to minimum required value (i.e., 2 per engine).
