xfs: get rid of the log item descriptor

It's just a connector between a transaction and a log item. There's
a 1:1 relationship between a log item descriptor and a log item,
and a 1:1 relationship between a log item descriptor and a
transaction. Both relationships are created and terminated at the
same time, so why do we even have the descriptor?

Replace it with a specific list_head in the log item and a new
log item dirtied flag to replace the XFS_LID_DIRTY flag.
