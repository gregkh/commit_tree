perf annotate: Split allocation of annotated_source struct

So that we can allocate just the notes->src->cyc_hist, that, unlike
notes->src->histograms, is not per event, and in paths where we
need to lazily allocate notes->src->cyc_hist we don't have the
number of events handy to also allocate ->histograms.
