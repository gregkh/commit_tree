bpf: btf: Add BTF support to libbpf

If the ".BTF" elf section exists, libbpf will try to create
a btf_fd (through BPF_BTF_LOAD).  If that fails, it will still
continue loading the bpf prog/map without the BTF.

If the bpf_object has a BTF loaded, it will create a map with the btf_fd.
libbpf will try to figure out the btf_key_id and btf_value_id of a map by
finding the BTF type with name "<map_name>_key" and "<map_name>_value".
If they cannot be found, it will continue without using the BTF.
