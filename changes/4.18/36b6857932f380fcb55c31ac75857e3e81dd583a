xhci: Allow more than 32 quirks

We now have 32 different quirks, and the field that holds them
is full. Let's bump it up to the next stage so that we can handle
some more... The type is now an unsigned long long, which is 64bit
on most architectures.

We take this opportunity to change the quirks from using (1 << x)
to BIT_ULL(x).
