bpf: btf: Rename btf_key_id and btf_value_id in bpf_map_info

In "struct bpf_map_info", the name "btf_id", "btf_key_id" and "btf_value_id"
could cause confusion because the "id" of "btf_id" means the BPF obj id
given to the BTF object while
"btf_key_id" and "btf_value_id" means the BTF type id within
that BTF object.

To make it clear, btf_key_id and btf_value_id are
renamed to btf_key_type_id and btf_value_type_id.
