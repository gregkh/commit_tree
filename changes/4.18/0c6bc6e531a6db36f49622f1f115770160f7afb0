bpf: fix sk_skb programs without skb->dev assigned

Multiple BPF helpers in use by sk_skb programs calculate the max
skb length using the __bpf_skb_max_len function. However, this
calculates the max length using the skb->dev pointer which can be
NULL when an sk_skb program is paired with an sk_msg program.

To force this a sk_msg program needs to redirect into the ingress
path of a sock with an attach sk_skb program. Then the the sk_skb
program would need to call one of the helpers that adjust the skb
size.

To fix the null ptr dereference use SKB_MAX_ALLOC size if no dev
is available.
