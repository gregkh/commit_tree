arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7795: sort subnodes of the root node

Sort subnodes of the root node alphanumerically.

This is part of an ongoing effort to provide consistent node
order in the DT of Renesas SoCs to improve maintainability.

Also remove excessive line-wrapping of interrupts-extended property of
timer node.

This should not have any run-time effect.
