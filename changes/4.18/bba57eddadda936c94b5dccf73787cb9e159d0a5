usb: quirks: add delay quirks for Corsair Strafe

Corsair Strafe appears to suffer from the same issues
as the Corsair Strafe RGB.
Apply the same quirks (control message delay and init delay)
that the RGB version has to 1b1c:1b15.

With these quirks in place the keyboard works correctly upon
booting the system, and no longer requires reattaching the device.
