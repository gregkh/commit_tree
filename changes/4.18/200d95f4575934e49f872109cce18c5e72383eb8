tcp: add TCPAckCompressed SNMP counter

This counter tracks number of ACK packets that the host has not sent,
thanks to ACK compression.

Sample output :

$ nstat -n;sleep 1;nstat|egrep "IpInReceives|IpOutRequests|TcpInSegs|TcpOutSegs|TcpExtTCPAckCompressed"
IpInReceives                    123250             0.0
IpOutRequests                   3684               0.0
TcpInSegs                       123251             0.0
TcpOutSegs                      3684               0.0
TcpExtTCPAckCompressed          119252             0.0
