powerpc/kbuild: Use flags variables rather than overriding LD/CC/AS

The powerpc toolchain can compile combinations of 32/64 bit and
big/little endian, so it's convenient to consider, e.g.,

  `CC -m64 -mbig-endian`

To be the C compiler for the purpose of invoking it to build target
artifacts. So overriding the CC variable to include these flags works
for this purpose.

Unfortunately that is not compatible with the way the proposed new
Kconfig macro language will work.

After previous patches in this series, these flags can be carefully
passed in using flags instead.
