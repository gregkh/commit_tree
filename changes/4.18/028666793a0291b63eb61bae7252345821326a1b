drm/i915/selftests: Avoid repeatedly harming the same innocent context

We don't handle resetting the kernel context very well, or presumably any
context executing its breadcrumb commands in the ring as opposed to the
batchbuffer and flush. If we trigger a device reset twice in quick
succession while the kernel context is executing, we may end up skipping
the breadcrumb.  This is really only a problem for the selftest as
normally there is a large interlude between resets (hangcheck), or we
focus on resetting just one engine and so avoid repeatedly resetting
innocents.

Something to try would be a preempt-to-idle to quiesce the engine before
reset, so that innocent contexts would be spared the reset.
