vfio/type1: Fix task tracking for QEMU vCPU hotplug

MAP_DMA ioctls might be called from various threads within a process,
for example when using QEMU, the vCPU threads are often generating
these calls and we therefore take a reference to that vCPU task.
However, QEMU also supports vCPU hotplug on some machines and the task
that called MAP_DMA may have exited by the time UNMAP_DMA is called,
resulting in the mm_struct pointer being NULL and thus a failure to
match against the existing mapping.

To resolve this, we instead take a reference to the thread
group_leader, which has the same mm_struct and resource limits, but
is less likely exit, at least in the QEMU case.  A difficulty here is
guaranteeing that the capabilities of the group_leader match that of
the calling thread, which we resolve by tracking CAP_IPC_LOCK at the
time of calling rather than at an indeterminate time in the future.
Potentially this also results in better efficiency as this is now
recorded once per MAP_DMA ioctl.
