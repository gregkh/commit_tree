block: consolidate struct request timestamp fields

Currently, struct request has four timestamp fields:

- A start time, set at get_request time, in jiffies, used for iostats
- An I/O start time, set at start_request time, in ktime nanoseconds,
  used for blk-stats (i.e., wbt, kyber, hybrid polling)
- Another start time and another I/O start time, used for cfq and bfq

These can all be consolidated into one start time and one I/O start
time, both in ktime nanoseconds, shaving off up to 16 bytes from struct
request depending on the kernel config.
