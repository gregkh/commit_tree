regulator: core: Resolve coupled regulators

On Odroid XU3/4 and other Exynos5422 based boards there is a case, that
different devices on the board are supplied by different regulators
with non-fixed voltages. If one of these devices temporarily requires
higher voltage, there might occur a situation that the spread between
two devices' voltages is so high, that there is a risk of changing
'high' and 'low' states on the interconnection between devices powered
by those regulators.

Fill coupling descriptor with data obtained from DTS using previously
defined of_functions. Fail to register a regulator, if some data
inconsistency occurs. If some coupled regulators are not yet registered,
don't fail to register, but try to resolve them in late init call.
