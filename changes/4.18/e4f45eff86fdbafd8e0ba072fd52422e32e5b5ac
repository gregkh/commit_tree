xfs: check directory bestfree information in the verifier

Create a variant of xfs_dir2_data_freefind that is suitable for use in a
verifier.  Because _freefind is called by the verifier, we simply
duplicate the _freefind function, convert the ASSERTs to return
__this_address, and modify the verifier to call our new function.  Once
we've made it impossible for directory blocks with bad bestfree data to
make it into the filesystem we can remove the DEBUG code from the
regular _freefind function.

Underlying argument: corruption of on-disk metadata should return
-EFSCORRUPTED instead of blowing ASSERTs.
