drm/etnaviv: correct timeout calculation

The old way did clamp the jiffy conversion and thus caused the timeouts
to become negative after some time. Also it didn't work with userspace
which actually fills the upper 32bits of the 64bit timestamp value.

clock_gettime() is 32-bit on 32-bit architectures. Using 64-bit timespec
math, like we do in this commit, means that when a wrap occurs, the
specified timeout goes into the past and we can't request a timeout in
the future. As the Linux implementation of CLOCK_MONOTONIC is reasonable
and starts at 0, the first such timer wrap will occur after approx. 68
years of system uptime.
