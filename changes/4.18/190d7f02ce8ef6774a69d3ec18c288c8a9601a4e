HID: input: do not increment usages when a duplicate is found

This is something that bothered us from a long time. When hid-input
doesn't know how to map a usage, it uses *_MISC. But there is something
else which increments the usage if the evdev code is already used.

This leads to few issues:
- some devices may have their ABS_X mapped to ABS_Y if they export a bad
  set of usages (see the DragonRise joysticks IIRC -> fixed in a specific
  HID driver)
- *_MISC + N might (will) conflict with other defined axes (my Logitech
  H800 exports some multitouch axes because of that)
- this prevents to freely add some new evdev usages, because "hey, my
  headset will now report ABS_COFFEE, and it's not coffee capable".

So let's try to kill this nonsense, and hope we won't break too many
devices.

I my headset case, the ABS_MISC axes are created because of some
proprietary usages, so we might not break that many devices.

For backward compatibility, a quirk HID_QUIRK_INCREMENT_USAGE_ON_DUPLICATE
is created and can be applied to any device that needs this behavior.
