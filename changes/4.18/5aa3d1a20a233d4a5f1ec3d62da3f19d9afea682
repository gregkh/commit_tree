tools/power turbostat: Read extended processor family from CPUID

This fixes the reported family on modern AMD processors (e.g. Ryzen,
which is family 0x17). Previously these processors all showed up as
family 0xf.

See the document
https://support.amd.com/TechDocs/56255_OSRR.pdf
section CPUID_Fn00000001_EAX for how to calculate the family
from the BaseFamily and ExtFamily values.

This matches the code in arch/x86/lib/cpu.c
