backlight: pwm_bl: Don't use GPIOF_* with gpiod_get_direction

The documentation was wrong, gpiod_get_direction() returns 0/1 instead
of the GPIOF_* flags. The docs were fixed with commit 94fc73094abe47
("gpio: correct docs about return value of gpiod_get_direction"). Now,
fix this user (until a better, system-wide solution is in place).
