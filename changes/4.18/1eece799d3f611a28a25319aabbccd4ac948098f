net: qualcomm: rmnet: Capture all drops in transmit path

Packets in transmit path could potentially be dropped if there were
errors while adding the MAP header or the checksum header.
Increment the tx_drops stats in these cases.

Additionally, refactor the code to free the packet and increment
the tx_drops stat under a single label.
