ath: Add regulatory mapping for Nicaragua

The country code is used by the ath to detect the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 name
and to select the correct conformance test limits (CTL) for a country. If
the country isn't available and it is still programmed in the EEPROM then
it will cause an error and stop the initialization with:

  Invalid EEPROM contents

The current CTL mappings for this country are:

* 2.4GHz: FCC
* 5GHz: FCC
