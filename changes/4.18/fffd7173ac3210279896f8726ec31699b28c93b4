tty: serial: drop ATH79 specific SoC symbols

QCA MIPS support is being converted to pure OF. As part of this we are
dropping the SOC_AR* symbols. Additionally the SERIAL_AR933X style tty
is also found on a few SoCs newer that the AR933x.

This patch changes the dependency to ATH79, thus fixing the 2 issues
described above.
