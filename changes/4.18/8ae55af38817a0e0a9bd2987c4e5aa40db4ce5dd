spi: pxa2xx: Remove pump_transfers string from dev_ prints

We are going to rename and modify pump_transfers(). Prepare for it by
removing the string "pump_transfers:" from error and warning prints.

While at it make these user-visible strings single line in sources as it
helps source grepping from error reports.
