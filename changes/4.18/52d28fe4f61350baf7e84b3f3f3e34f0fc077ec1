xprtrdma: Try to fail quickly if proto=rdma

If this can't be done, there's no local device that can be used
to establish an RDMA-capable network path to the remote. In this
case, the RDMA CM very quickly posts an RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_ERROR
upcall.

Currently rpcrdma_conn_upcall() converts RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_ERROR
to EHOSTUNREACH. mount.nfs seems to want to retry EHOSTUNREACH
forever, thinking that this is a temporary situation. This makes
mount.nfs appear to hang if I try to mount with proto=rdma through,
say, a conventional Ethernet device.

If the admin has specified proto=rdma along with a server IP address
that requires a network path that does not support RDMA, instead
let's fail with a permanent error. -EPROTONOSUPPORT is returned when
NFSv4 or one of its minor versions is not supported.

-EPROTO is not (currently) retried by mount.nfs.

There are potentially other similar cases where -EPROTO is an
appropriate return code.
