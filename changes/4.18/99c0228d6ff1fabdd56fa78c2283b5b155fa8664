HISI LPC: Re-Add ACPI child enumeration support

Since we no longer use the MFD APIs to enumerate the
child devices on the bus, use the platform driver APIs
directly.

In this patch we iterate of the children devices for the
host, and create a platform device directly per child.

For the iterating, we match the child ACPI HID against a
known list of supported child devices and their respective
ACPIs HID, to find the device name and any other
supplementary data.
