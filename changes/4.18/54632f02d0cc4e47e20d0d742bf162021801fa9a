fscrypt: drop max_namelen check from fname_decrypt()

fname_decrypt() returns an error if the input filename is longer than
the inode's ->max_namelen() as given by the filesystem.  But, this
doesn't actually make sense because the filesystem provided the input
filename in the first place, where it was subject to the filesystem's
limits.  And fname_decrypt() has no internal limit itself.

Thus, remove this unnecessary check.
