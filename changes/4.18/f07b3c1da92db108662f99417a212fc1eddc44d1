HID: generic: create one input report per application type

It is not a good idea to try to fit all types of applications in the
same input report. There are a lot of devices that are needing
the quirk HID_MULTI_INPUT but this quirk doesn't match the actual HID
description as it is based on the report ID.

Given that most devices with MULTI_INPUT I can think of split nicely
the devices inputs into application, it is a good thing to split the
devices by default based on this assumption.

Also make hid-multitouch following this rule, to not have to deal
with too many input created.

While we are at it, fix some checkpatch complaints about converting
'unsigned' to 'unsigned int'.
