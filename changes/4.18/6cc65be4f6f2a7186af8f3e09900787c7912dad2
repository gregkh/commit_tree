locking/qspinlock: Fix build for anonymous union in older GCC compilers

One of my tests compiles the kernel with gcc 4.5.3, and I hit the
following build error:

  include/linux/semaphore.h: In function 'sema_init':
  include/linux/semaphore.h:35:17: error: unknown field 'val' specified in initializer
  include/linux/semaphore.h:35:17: warning: missing braces around initializer
  include/linux/semaphore.h:35:17: warning: (near initialization for '(anonymous).raw_lock.<anonymous>.val')

I bisected it down to:

 625e88be1f41 ("locking/qspinlock: Merge 'struct __qspinlock' into 'struct qspinlock'")

... which makes qspinlock have an anonymous union, which makes initializing it special
for older compilers. By adding strategic brackets, it makes the build
happy again.
