NFSv4/pnfs: Ensure pnfs_parse_lgopen() won't try to parse uninitialised data

We need to ensure that pnfs_parse_lgopen() doesn't try to parse a
struct nfs4_layoutget_res that was not filled by a successful call
to decode_layoutget(). This can happen if we performed a cached open,
or if either the OP_ACCESS or OP_GETATTR operations preceding the
OP_LAYOUTGET in the compound returned an error.

By initialising the 'status' field to NFS4ERR_DELAY, we ensure that
pnfs_parse_lgopen() won't try to interpret the structure.
