powerpc/mm/hugetlb: Update hugetlb related locks

With split pmd page table lock enabled, we don't use mm->page_table_lock when
updating pmd entries. This patch update hugetlb path to use the right lock
when inserting huge page directory entries into page table.

ex: if we are using hugepd and inserting hugepd entry at the pmd level, we
use pmd_lockptr, which based on config can be split pmd lock.

For update huge page directory entries itself we use mm->page_table_lock. We
do have a helper huge_pte_lockptr() for that.
