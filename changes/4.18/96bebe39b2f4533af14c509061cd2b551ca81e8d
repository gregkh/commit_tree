drm/i915/gvt: scan non-privileged batch buffer for debug purpose

For perfomance purpose, scanning of non-privileged batch buffer is turned
off by default. But for debugging purpose, it can be turned on via debugfs.
After scanning, we submit the original non-privileged batch buffer into
hardware, so that the scanning is only a peeking window of guest submitted
commands and will not affect the execution results.

v4:
- refine debugfs print format&content (zhenyu wang)
- print engine id instread of engine name to prevent potential memory leak
  in debugfs warning message. (zhenyu wang)

v3:
- change vgpu->scan_nonprivbb from type bool to u32, so it is able to
  selectively turn on/off scanning of non-privileged batch buffer on engine
  level. e.g.
  if vgpu->scan_nonprivbb=3, then it will scan non-privileged batch buffer
  on engine 0 and 1.
- in debugfs interface to set vgpu->scan_nonprivbb, print warning message
  to warn user and explicitly tell state change in kernel log (zhenyu wang)
v2:
- rebase
- update comments for start_gma_offset (henry)
