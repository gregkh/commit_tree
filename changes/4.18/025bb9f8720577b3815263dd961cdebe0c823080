NFSv4.0: Remove transport protocol name from non-UCS client ID

Commit 69dd716c5ffd ("NFSv4: Add socket proto argument to
setclientid") (2007) added the transport protocol name to the client
ID string, but the patch description doesn't explain why this was
necessary.

At that time, the only transport protocol name that would have been
used is "tcp" (for both IPv4 and IPv6), resulting in no additional
distinctiveness of the client ID string.

Since there is one client instance, the server should recognize it's
state whether the client is connecting via TCP or RDMA. Same client,
same lease.
