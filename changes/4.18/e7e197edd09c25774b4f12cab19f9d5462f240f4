qmi_wwan: add support for the Dell Wireless 5821e module

This module exposes two USB configurations: a QMI+AT capable setup on
USB config #1 and a MBIM capable setup on USB config #2.

By default the kernel will choose the MBIM capable configuration as
long as the cdc_mbim driver is available. This patch adds support for
the QMI port in the secondary configuration.
