block, bfq: increase weight-raising duration for interactive apps

The maximum possible duration of the weight-raising period for
interactive applications is limited to 13 seconds, as this is the time
needed to load the largest application that we considered when tuning
weight raising. Unfortunately, in such an evaluation, we did not
consider the case of very slow virtual machines.

For example, on a QEMU/KVM virtual machine
- running in a slow PC;
- with a virtual disk stacked on a slow low-end 5400rpm HDD;
- serving a heavy I/O workload, such as the sequential reading of
several files;
mplayer takes 23 seconds to start, if constantly weight-raised.

To address this issue, this commit conservatively sets the upper limit
for weight-raising duration to 25 seconds.
