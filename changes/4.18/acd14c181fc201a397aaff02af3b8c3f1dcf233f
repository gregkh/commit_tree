media: v4l2-device.h: always expose mdev

The mdev field is only present if CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER is set.
But since we will need to pass the media_device to vb2 and the
control framework it is very convenient to just make this field
available all the time. If CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER is not set,
then it will just be NULL.
