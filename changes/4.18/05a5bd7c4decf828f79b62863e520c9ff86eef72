Btrfs: delete dead code in btrfs_orphan_commit_root()

btrfs_orphan_commit_root() tries to delete an orphan item for a
subvolume in the tree root, but we don't actually insert that item in
the first place. See commit 0a0d4415e338 ("Btrfs: delete dead code in
btrfs_orphan_add()"). We can get rid of it.
