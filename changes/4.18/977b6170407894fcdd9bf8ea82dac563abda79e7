cifs: remove rfc1002 header from all SMB2 response structures

Separate out all the 4 byte rfc1002 headers so that they are no longer
part of the SMB2 header structures to prepare for future work to add
compounding support.

Update the smb3 transform header processing that we no longer have
a rfc1002 header at the start of this structure.

Update smb2_readv_callback to accommodate that the first iovector in the
response is no the smb2 header and no longer a rfc1002 header.
