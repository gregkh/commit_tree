y2038: xtensa: Extend sysvipc data structures

xtensa, uses a nonstandard variation of the generic sysvipc
data structures, intended to have the padding moved around
so it can deal with big-endian 32-bit user space that has
64-bit time_t.

xtensa tries hard to define the structures so they work
in both big-endian and little-endian systems with padding
on the right side.
However, they only succeeded for for two of the three structures,
and their struct shmid64_ds ended up being defined in two
identical copies, and the big-endian one is wrong.

This takes just take the same approach here that we have for
the asm-generic headers and adds separate 32-bit fields for the
upper halves of the timestamps, to let libc deal with the mess
in user space.
