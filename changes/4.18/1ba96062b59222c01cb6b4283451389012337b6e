soc: mediatek: add a fixed wait for SRAM stable

MT7622_POWER_DOMAIN_WB doesn't send an ACK when its managed SRAM becomes
stable, which is not like the behavior the other power domains should
have. Therefore, it's necessary for such a power domain to have a fixed
and well-predefined duration to wait until its managed SRAM can be allowed
to access by all functions running on the top.
