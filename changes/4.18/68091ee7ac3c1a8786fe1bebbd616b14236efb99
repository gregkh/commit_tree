x86/CPU/AMD: Calculate last level cache ID from number of sharing threads

Last Level Cache ID can be calculated from the number of threads sharing
the cache, which is available from CPUID Fn0x8000001D (Cache Properties).
This is used to left-shift the APIC ID to derive LLC ID.

Therefore, default to this method unless the APIC ID enumeration does not
follow the scheme.
