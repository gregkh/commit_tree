media: rc: per-protocol repeat period and minimum keyup timer

Each IR protocol has its own repeat period. We can minimise the keyup
timer to be the protocol period + IR timeout. This makes keys less
"sticky" and makes IR more reactive and nicer to use.

This feature was previously attempted in commit d57ea877af38 ("media: rc:
per-protocol repeat period"), but that did not take the IR timeout into
account, and had to be reverted.
