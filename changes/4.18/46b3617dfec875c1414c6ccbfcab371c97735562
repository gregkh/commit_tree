drm/i915: Actually flush interrupts on reset not just wedging

Commit 0f36a85c3bd5 ("drm/i915: Flush pending interrupt following a GPU
reset") got confused and only applied the flush to the set-wedge path
(which itself is proving troublesome), but we also need the
serialisation on the regular reset path. Oops.

Move the interrupt into reset_irq() and make it common to the reset and
final set-wedge.

v2: reset_irq() after port cancellation, as we assert that
execlists->active is sane for cancellation (and is being reset by
reset_irq).
