x86/pci-dma: switch the VIA 32-bit DMA quirk to use the struct device flag

Instead of globally disabling > 32bit DMA using the arch_dma_supported
hook walk the PCI bus under the actually affected bridge and mark every
device with the dma_32bit_limit flag.  This also gets rid of the
arch_dma_supported hook entirely.
