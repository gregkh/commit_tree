can: peak_canfd: fix firmware < v3.3.0: limit allocation to 32-bit DMA addr only

The DMA logic in firmwares < v3.3.0 embedded in the PCAN-PCIe FD cards
family is not capable of handling a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit logical
addresses. If the board is equipped with 2 or 4 CAN ports, then such a
situation might lead to a PCIe Bus Error "Malformed TLP" packet
as well as "irq xx: nobody cared" issue.

This patch adds a workaround that requests only 32-bit DMA addresses
when these might be allocated outside of the 4 GB area.

This issue has been fixed in firmware v3.3.0 and next.
