Btrfs: update stale comments referencing vmtruncate()

Commit a41ad394a03b ("Btrfs: convert to the new truncate sequence")
changed btrfs_setsize() to call truncate_setsize() instead of
vmtruncate() but didn't update the comment above it. truncate_setsize()
never fails (the IS_SWAPFILE() check happens elsewhere), so remove the
comment.

Additionally, the comment above btrfs_page_mkwrite() references
vmtruncate(), but truncate_setsize() does the size write and page
locking now.
