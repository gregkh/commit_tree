blk-mq: clear hctx->dispatch_from when mappings change

When the number of hardware queues is changed, the drivers will call
blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() to remap hardware queues. This changes
the ctx mappings, but the current code doesn't clear the
->dispatch_from hint. This can result in dispatch_from pointing to
a ctx that isn't mapped to the hctx anymore.

Moved the placement of the clearing to where we clear other items
pertaining to the existing mapping, added Fixes line, and reworded
the commit message.
