ravb: fix invalid context bug while changing link options by ethtool

The change fixes sleep in atomic context bug, which is encountered
every time when link settings are changed by ethtool.

Since commit 35b5f6b1a82b ("PHYLIB: Locking fixes for PHY I/O
potentially sleeping") phy_start_aneg() function utilizes a mutex
to serialize changes to phy state, however that helper function is
called in atomic context under a grabbed spinlock, because
phy_start_aneg() is called by phy_ethtool_ksettings_set() and by
replaced phy_ethtool_sset() helpers from phylib.

Now duplex mode setting is enforced in ravb_adjust_link() only, also
now RX/TX is disabled when link is put down or modifications to E-MAC
registers ECMR and GECMR are expected for both cases of checked and
ignored link status pin state from E-MAC interrupt handler.
