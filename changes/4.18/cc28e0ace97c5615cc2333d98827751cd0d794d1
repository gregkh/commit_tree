scsi: qla2xxx: Move GPSC and GFPNID out of session management

Move GPSC & GFPNID commands out of session management to reduce time lag
in reporting the session state to remote port. These commands are not
essential when it comes to maintaining the rport state. Delay sending
these commands after rport state is set to Online.
