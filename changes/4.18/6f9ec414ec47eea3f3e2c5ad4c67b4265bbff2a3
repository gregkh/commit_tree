drm/i915: Remove the impedance mismatch around intel_engine_enable_signaling

There is some redundancy between dma_fence->ops->enable_signaling (via
i915_fence_enable_signaling) and our backend,
intel_engine_enable_signaling() in that both levels recheck the fence
status multiple times. If we convert intel_engine_enable_signaling() to
return the information desired by dma_fence->ops->enable_signaling, we
can reduce i915_fence_enable_signaling to a simple stub and avoid
trying to reinterpret the same information.
