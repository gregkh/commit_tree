ACPICA: IORT: Update for revision D

IORT revision D contains a few additions and fixes to
currently-supported tables:

- SMMUv3 proximity domain field is enlarged to 4 bytes for consistency
  with SRAT
- Root complex nodes gain an address size limit field equivalent to that
  of named components
- Named component nodes gain a way to describe PASID (substream_ID)
  support, encoded in their flags

Additionally, we fix a couple of outstanding points in passing:
- Add the stall support flag for named components defined in revision C
- Fix SMMUv3 HTTU override mask, which should always have been 2 bits
