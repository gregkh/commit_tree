usb: dwc3: gadget: Correct handling of scattergather lists

The code logic in dwc3_prepare_one_trb() incorrectly uses the address
and length fields present in req packet for mapping TRB's instead of
using the address and length fields of scattergather lists. This patch
correct's the code to use sg->address and sg->length when scattergather
lists are present.
