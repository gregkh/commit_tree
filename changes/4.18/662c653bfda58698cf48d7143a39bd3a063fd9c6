Btrfs: grab write lock directly if write_lock_level is the max level

Typically, when acquiring root node's lock, btrfs tries its best to get
read lock and trade for write lock if @write_lock_level implies to do so.

In case of (cow && (p->keep_locks || p->lowest_level)), write_lock_level
is set to BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL, which means we need to acquire root node's
write lock directly.

In this particular case, the dance of acquiring read lock and then trading
for write lock can be saved.
