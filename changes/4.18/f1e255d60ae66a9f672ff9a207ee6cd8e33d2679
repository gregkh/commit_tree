USB: yurex: fix out-of-bounds uaccess in read handler

In general, accessing userspace memory beyond the length of the supplied
buffer in VFS read/write handlers can lead to both kernel memory corruption
(via kernel_read()/kernel_write(), which can e.g. be triggered via
sys_splice()) and privilege escalation inside userspace.

Fix it by using simple_read_from_buffer() instead of custom logic.
