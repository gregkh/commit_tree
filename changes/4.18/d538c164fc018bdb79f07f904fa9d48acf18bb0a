mm/sparse.c: check __highest_present_section_nr only for a present section

When searching a present section, there are two boundaries:

    * __highest_present_section_nr
    * NR_MEM_SECTIONS

And it is known, __highest_present_section_nr is a more strict boundary
than NR_MEM_SECTIONS.  This means it would be necessary to check
__highest_present_section_nr only.
