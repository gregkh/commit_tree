bpf: xdp: allow offloads to store into rx_queue_index

It's fairly easy for offloaded XDP programs to select the RX queue
packets go to.  We need a way of expressing this in the software.
Allow write to the rx_queue_index field of struct xdp_md for
device-bound programs.

Skip convert_ctx_access callback entirely for offloads.
