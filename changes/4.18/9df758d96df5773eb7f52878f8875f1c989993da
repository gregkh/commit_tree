ACPICA: Fix potential infinite loop in acpi_rs_dump_byte_list

There is a potenial infinite loop if acpi_rs_dump_byte_list is
called with a Length greater than 255 since the current loop
counter is just a u8 and will wrap to zero and never reach
the desired value in Length.  Fix this by making the loop
counter the size type as Length.
