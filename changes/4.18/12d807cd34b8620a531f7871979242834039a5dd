clk: qcom: gcc-msm8996: Disable halt check on UFS clocks

The halt check of the UFS symbol clocks always fails, as such probing
UFS after clk_disable_unused always fails. This makes it impossible to
boot a system with the UFS phy or UFS HCD drivers compiled as modules.

Follow SDM845 and disable the halt check on these clocks.
