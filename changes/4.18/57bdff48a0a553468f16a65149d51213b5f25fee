drm/i915: Reword warning for missing cases

In some places we end up converting switch statements to a series of
if/else, particularly when introducing helper functions to handle a
group of cases. It's tempting to either leave a wrong warning (since now
we don't have a switch case anymore) or to convert to WARN(1, ...),
but we can just provide a better message and avoid the doubt when such
conversions arrise.

Introducing a warning inside i915_driver_load() just for tests we get:

[ 4535.233717] Missing case (ret == 0)
[ 4535.233868] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 795 at drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drv.c:1341 i915_driver_load+0x42/0x10e0 [i915]

which is clear enough.

v2: remove __func__ since this is already on the warning.
