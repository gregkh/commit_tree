PCI: dwc: Small computation improvement

Replace a division by 2 operation for a right shift rotation of 1 bit.

Probably any recent and decent compiler does this kind of substitution
in order to improve code performance. Nevertheless it's a coding good
practice whenever there is a division / multiplication by multiple of 2
to replace it by the equivalent operation in this case, the shift
rotation.
