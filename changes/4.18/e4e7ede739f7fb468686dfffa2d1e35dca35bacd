Btrfs: fix mount failure when qgroup rescan is in progress

If a power failure happens while the qgroup rescan kthread is running,
the next mount operation will always fail. This is because of a recent
regression that makes qgroup_rescan_init() incorrectly return -EINVAL
when we are mounting the filesystem (through btrfs_read_qgroup_config()).
This causes the -EINVAL error to be returned regardless of any qgroup
flags being set instead of returning the error only when neither of
the flags BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN nor BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON
are set.

A test case for fstests follows up soon.
