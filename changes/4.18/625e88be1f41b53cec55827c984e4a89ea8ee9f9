locking/qspinlock: Merge 'struct __qspinlock' into 'struct qspinlock'

'struct __qspinlock' provides a handy union of fields so that
subcomponents of the lockword can be accessed by name, without having to
manage shifts and masks explicitly and take endianness into account.

This is useful in qspinlock.h and also potentially in arch headers, so
move the 'struct __qspinlock' into 'struct qspinlock' and kill the extra
definition.
