svcrdma: Trace key RPC/RDMA protocol events

This includes:
  * Transport accept and tear-down
  * Decisions about using Write and Reply chunks
  * Each RDMA segment that is handled
  * Whenever an RDMA_ERR is sent

As a clean-up, I've standardized the order of the includes, and
removed some now redundant dprintk call sites.
