gpio: Remove VLA from gpiolib

The new challenge is to remove VLAs from the kernel
(see https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/7/621) to eventually
turn on -Wvla.

Using a kmalloc array is the easy way to fix this but kmalloc is still
more expensive than stack allocation. Introduce a fast path with a
fixed size stack array to cover most chip with gpios below some fixed
amount. The slow path dynamically allocates an array to cover those
chips with a large number of gpios.
