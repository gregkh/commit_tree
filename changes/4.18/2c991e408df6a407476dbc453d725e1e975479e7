x86/events/intel/ds: Fix bts_interrupt_threshold alignment

Markus reported that BTS is sporadically missing the tail of the trace
in the perf_event data buffer: [decode error (1): instruction overflow]
shown in GDB; and bisected it to the conversion of debug_store to PTI.

A little "optimization" crept into alloc_bts_buffer(), which mistakenly
placed bts_interrupt_threshold away from the 24-byte record boundary.
Intel SDM Vol 3B 17.4.9 says "This address must point to an offset from
the BTS buffer base that is a multiple of the BTS record size."

Revert "max" from a byte count to a record count, to calculate the
bts_interrupt_threshold correctly: which turns out to fix problem seen.
