media: update/fix my e-mail on some places

There are two places pointing to an unexisting "m.chehab@kernel.org"
email. I never had such email, so, I'm unsure how it ends there.
Anyway, it is plain wrong.

While here, use my canonical e-mail on a bunch of places that
are pointing to another e-mail. The idea is that, from now on,
all places will be pointing to the same SMTP server.
