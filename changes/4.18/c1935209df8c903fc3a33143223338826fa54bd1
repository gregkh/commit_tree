rcu: Simplify and inline cpu_needs_another_gp()

Now that RCU no longer relies on failsafe checks, cpu_needs_another_gp()
can be greatly simplified.  This simplification eliminates the last
call to rcu_future_needs_gp() and to rcu_segcblist_future_gp_needed(),
both of which which can then be eliminated.  And then, because
cpu_needs_another_gp() is called only from __rcu_pending(), it can be
inlined and eliminated.

This commit carries out the simplification, inlining, and elimination
called out above.
