perf/arm-cci: Remove pointless PMU disabling

The CCI PMU driver bears some legacy remnants of the arm_pmu framework
from when it was split in c6f85cb4305b ("bus: cci: move away from
arm_pmu framework"). In particular this perf_pmu_{dis,en}able() dance
around pmu->add which was fixed for arm_pmu in a9e469d1c89b
("drivers/perf: arm_pmu: remove pointless PMU disabling").

For the exact same reasons (i.e. perf core already does this around the
call anyway), give cci_pmu_add() the exact same change, which also
prevents having to export those core functions to build it as a module.
