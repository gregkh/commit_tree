pinctrl: samsung: Correct EINTG banks order

All banks with GPIO interrupts should be at beginning of bank array and
without any other types of banks between them.  This order is expected
by exynos_eint_gpio_irq, when doing interrupt group to bank translation.
Otherwise, kernel NULL pointer dereference would happen when trying to
handle interrupt, due to wrong bank being looked up.  Observed on
s5pv210, when trying to handle gpj0 interrupt, where kernel was mapping
it to gpi bank.
