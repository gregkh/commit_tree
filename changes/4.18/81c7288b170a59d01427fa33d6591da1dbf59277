sched: cls: enable verbose logging

Currently, when the rule is not to be exclusively executed by the
hardware, extack is not passed along and offloading failures don't
get logged. The idea was that hardware failures are okay because the
rule will get executed in software then and this way it doesn't confuse
unware users.

But this is not helpful in case one needs to understand why a certain
rule failed to get offloaded. Considering it may have been a temporary
failure, like resources exceeded or so, reproducing it later and knowing
that it is triggering the same reason may be challenging.

The ultimate goal is to improve Open vSwitch debuggability when using
flower offloading.

This patch adds a new flag to enable verbose logging. With the flag set,
extack will be passed to the driver, which will be able to log the
error. As the operation itself probably won't fail (not because of this,
at least), current iproute will already log it as a Warning.

The flag is generic, so it can be reused later. No need to restrict it
just for HW offloading. The command line will follow the syntax that
tc-ebpf already uses, tc ... [ verbose ] ... , and extend its meaning.

For example:
# ./tc qdisc add dev p7p1 ingress
# ./tc filter add dev p7p1 parent ffff: protocol ip prio 1 \
	flower verbose \
	src_mac ed:13:db:00:00:00 dst_mac 01:80:c2:00:00:d0 \
	src_ip 56.0.0.0 dst_ip 55.0.0.0 action drop
Warning: TC offload is disabled on net device.
# echo $?
0
# ./tc filter add dev p7p1 parent ffff: protocol ip prio 1 \
	flower \
	src_mac ff:13:db:00:00:00 dst_mac 01:80:c2:00:00:d0 \
	src_ip 56.0.0.0 dst_ip 55.0.0.0 action drop
# echo $?
0
