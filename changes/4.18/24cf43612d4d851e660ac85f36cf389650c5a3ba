scsi: hisi_sas: optimise the usage of DQ locking

In the DQ tasklet processing it is not necessary to take the DQ lock, as
there is no contention between adding slots to the CQ and removing slots
from the matching DQ.

In addition, since we run each DQ in a separate tasklet context, there
would be no possible contention between DQ processing running for the
same queue in parallel.

It is still necessary to take hisi_hba lock when free'ing slots.
