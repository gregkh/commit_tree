btrfs: replace uuid_mutex by device_list_mutex in btrfs_open_devices

btrfs_open_devices() is using the uuid_mutex, but as btrfs_open_devices
is just limited to openning all the devices under for given fsid, so we
don't need uuid_mutex.

Instead it should hold the device_list_mutex as it updates the members
of the btrfs_fs_devices and btrfs_device and not the whole fs_devs list.
