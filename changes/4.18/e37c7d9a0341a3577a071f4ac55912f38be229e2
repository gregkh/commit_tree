scsi: core: sanitize++ in progress

Commit 505aa4b6a883 ("scsi: sd: Defer spinning up drive while SANITIZE is
in progress") may not be sufficient, especially if the SCSI SANITIZE
command is sent via the bsg or sg pass-throughs, since they don't use the
sd driver.

Add "Sanitize in progress" plus some other recent "... in progress"
additional sense codes into the scsi mid-level so they are treated in a
similar fashion to "Format in progress".
