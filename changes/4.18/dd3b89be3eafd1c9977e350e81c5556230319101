drm/nouveau/clk: Use list_for_each_entry_from_reverse

It's better to use "list_for_each_entry_from_reverse" for iterating list
than "for loop" as it makes the code more clear to read.
This patch replace "for loop" with "list_for_each_entry_from_reverse"
and "start" variable with "cstate" which helps in refactoring
the code and also "cstate" variable is more commonly used in the other
functions.

changes in v2:
"start" variable is removed, before "cstate" variable was removed
but "cstate" is more common so preferred "cstate" over "start".
