selftests: forwarding: Allow running specific tests

Similar to commit a511858c7536 ("selftests: fib_tests: Allow user to run
a specific test"), allow user to run only a subset of the tests using
the TESTS environment variable.

This is useful when not all the tests can pass on a given system.

Example:
# export TESTS="ping_ipv4 ping_ipv6"
# ./bridge_vlan_aware.sh
TEST: ping					[PASS]
TEST: ping6					[PASS]
