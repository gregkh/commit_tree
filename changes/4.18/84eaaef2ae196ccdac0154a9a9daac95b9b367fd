ALSA: dice: unuse second stream for MIDI conformant data channel for TC Electronic models

At present, all of models produced by TC Electronic except for Konnekt Live
are supported with hard-coded their stream formats. Studio Konnekt 48 is
sore model to support dual streams for both directions. The second stream
has no MIDI conformant data channel in its data block. But current
implementation transfers the second stream with MIDI conformant data
channel.

This commit fixes this issue.
