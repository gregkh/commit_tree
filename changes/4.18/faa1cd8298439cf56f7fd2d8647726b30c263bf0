net: bridge: avoid duplicate notification on up/down/change netdev events

While handling netdevice events, br_device_event() sometimes uses
br_stp_(disable|enable)_port which unconditionally send a notification,
but then a second notification for the same event is sent at the end of
the br_device_event() function. To avoid sending duplicate notifications
in such cases, check if one has already been sent (i.e.
br_stp_enable/disable_port have been called).
The patch is based on a change by Satish Ashok.
