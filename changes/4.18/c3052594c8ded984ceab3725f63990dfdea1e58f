ACPICA: provide abstraction for raw_spinlock_t

Provide a new lock type acpi_raw_spinlock which is implemented as
raw_spinlock_t on Linux. This type should be used in code which covers
small areas of code and disables interrupts only for short time even on
a realtime OS.
There is a fallback to spinlock_t if an OS does not provide an
implementation for acpi_raw_spinlock.
