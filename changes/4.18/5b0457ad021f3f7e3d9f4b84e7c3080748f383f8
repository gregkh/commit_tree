fsnotify: remove redundant arguments to handle_event()

inode_mark and vfsmount_mark arguments are passed to handle_event()
operation as function arguments as well as on iter_info struct.
The difference is that iter_info struct may contain marks that should
not be handled and are represented as NULL arguments to inode_mark or
vfsmount_mark.

Instead of passing the inode_mark and vfsmount_mark arguments, add
a report_mask member to iter_info struct to indicate which marks should
be handled, versus marks that should only be kept alive during user
wait.

This change is going to be used for passing more mark types
with handle_event() (i.e. super block marks).
