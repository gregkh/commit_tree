cfg80211: never ignore user regulatory hint

Currently user regulatory hint is ignored if all wiphys
in the system are self managed. But the hint is not ignored
if there is no wiphy in the system. This affects the global
regulatory setting. Global regulatory setting needs to be
maintained so that it can be applied to a new wiphy entering
the system. Therefore, do not ignore user regulatory setting
even if all wiphys in the system are self managed.
