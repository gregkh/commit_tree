nubus: Call bus_register unconditionally

Loading a NuBus driver module on a non-NuBus machine triggers the
BUG_ON(!drv->bus->p) in driver_register(), because bus_register() was
not called, because it is conditional on MACH_IS_MAC.

Fix the crash by calling bus_register() unconditionally. Call it from
a postcore_initcall(), like other busses do.

Hence, the bus type is available for device_register(), which happens
in a subsys initcall, and for driver_register(), which happens in a
device or module initcall.
