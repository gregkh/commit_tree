tcp: do not aggressively quick ack after ECN events

ECN signals currently forces TCP to enter quickack mode for
up to 16 (TCP_MAX_QUICKACKS) following incoming packets.

We believe this is not needed, and only sending one immediate ack
for the current packet should be enough.

This should reduce the extra load noticed in DCTCP environments,
after congestion events.

This is part 2 of our effort to reduce pure ACK packets.
