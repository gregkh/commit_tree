arm64: KVM: Add ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 support for guests

In order to offer ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 support to guests, we need
a bit of infrastructure.

Let's add a flag indicating whether or not the guest uses
SSBD mitigation. Depending on the state of this flag, allow
KVM to disable ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 before entering the guest,
and enable it when exiting it.
