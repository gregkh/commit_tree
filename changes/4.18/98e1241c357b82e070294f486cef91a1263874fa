ASoC: cirrus: i2s: IRQ-based stream watchdog

I2S controller on EP93xx seems to have undocumented HW issue. According to
"EP93xx Userâ€™s Guide", controller can handle underflow and either transmit
last sample or zeroes in such case until FIFO is filled again. In reality
undeflow conditions seem to confuse internal state machine from time to
time and the whole stream gets shifted by one byte (as captured by logic
analyser on the I2S outputs). One could only hear noise instead of original
stream and this continues until the FIFO is disabled and enabled again.

Work this around by watching underflow interrupt and resetting I2S TX
channel + fill FIFO with zero samples until DMA catches up again. This is
a nasty workaround, but it works. Hence, Kconfig option to disable it in
case of problems.
