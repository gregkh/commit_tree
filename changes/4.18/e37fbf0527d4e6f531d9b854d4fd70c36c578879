ARM: OMAP2+: prm44xx: Introduce context save/restore for am43 PRCM IO

There are two registers on am43x needed for IO daisy chain wake to work
properly, however currently after an RTC+DDR cycle they are lost. We
must take care to save and restore these before and after entering RTC
mode otherwise IO daisy chain wake will stop working from DeepSleep
after resuming.
