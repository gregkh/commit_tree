net: hns3: Remove packet statistics in the range of 8192~12287

Because the current statistics for size 8192~12287 are only valid for GE,
the ranges of 8192~9216 and 9217~12287 are valid only for LGE/CGE, and are
always 0 for GE interfaces. it is easy to cause confusion when viewing the
packet statistics using the command ethtool -S.

This patch removes the 8192~12287 range of packet statistics and uses the
8192~9216 and 9217~12287 ranges for statistics. This change depends on the
firmware upgrade.
