selftests/bpf: test_sockmap, check test failure

Test failures are not identified because exit code of RX/TX threads
is not checked. Also threads are not returning correct exit code.

- Return exit code from threads depending on test execution status
- In main thread, check the exit code of RX/TX threads
- Skip error checking for corked tests as they are expected to timeout
