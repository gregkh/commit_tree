scsi: fcoe: fix use-after-free in fcoe_ctlr_els_send

KASAN reports a use-after-free in fcoe_ctlr_els_send() when we're sending a
LOGO and have FIP debugging enabled. This is because we're first freeing
the skb and then printing the frame's DID. But the DID is a member of the
FC frame header which in turn is the skb's payload.

Exchange the debug print and kfree_skb() calls so we're not touching the
freed data.
