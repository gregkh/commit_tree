platform: x86: intel_scu_ipc: Replace mdelay with usleep_range in intel_scu_ipc_i2c_cntrl

intel_scu_ipc_i2c_cntrl() calls mutex_lock(), which indicates
this function is not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
intel_scu_ipc_i2c_cntrl() calls mdelay to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with usleep_range to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
