net/mlx5e: Only allow offloading decap egress (egdev) flows

We get egress rules through the egdev mechanism when the ingress device
is not supporting offload, with the expected use-case of tunnel decap
ingress rule set on shared tunnel device.

Make sure to offload egress/egdev rules only if decap action (tunnel key
unset) exists there and err otherwise.
