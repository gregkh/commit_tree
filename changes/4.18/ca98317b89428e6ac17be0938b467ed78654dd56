drm/i915: Specify which engines to reset following semaphore/event lockups

If the GPU is stuck waiting for an event or for a semaphore, we need to
reset the GPU in order to recover. We have to tell the reset routine
which engines we want reset, but we were still using the old interface
and declaring it as "not-fatal".
