ide: kill ide_toggle_bounce

ide_toggle_bounce did select various strange block bounce limits, including
not bouncing at all as soon as an iommu is present in the system.  Given
that the dma_map routines now handle any required bounce buffering except
for ISA DMA, and the ide code already must handle either ISA DMA or highmem
at least for iommu equipped systems we can get rid of the block layer
bounce limit setting entirely.
