ASoC: topology: Revert recent changes while boot errors are investigated

Krzysztof Kozlowski reported a NULL dereference in _instantiate_card()
on Odroid XU3 and XU boards which he bisected to 45f8cb57da0d7 (ASoC:
core: Allow topology to override machine driver FE DAI link config).
Revert that commit for now, along with f11a5c27f928 (ASoC: core: Add
name prefix for machines with topology rewrites) due to dependency
issues, in order to keep things booting cleanly in -next.
