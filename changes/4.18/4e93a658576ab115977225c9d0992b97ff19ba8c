mfd: intel-lpss: Fix Intel Cannon Lake LPSS I2C input clock

Intel Cannon Lake PCH has much higher 216 MHz input clock to LPSS I2C
than Sunrisepoint which uses 120 MHz. Preliminary information was that
both share the same clock rate but actual silicon implements elevated
rate for better support for 3.4 MHz high-speed I2C.

This incorrect input clock rate results too high I2C bus clock in case
ACPI doesn't provide tuned I2C timing parameters since I2C host
controller driver calculates them from input clock rate.

Fix this by using the correct rate. We still share the same 230 ns SDA
hold time value than Sunrisepoint.
