gen_stats: Fix netlink stats dumping in the presence of padding

The gen_stats facility will add a header for the toplevel nlattr of type
TCA_STATS2 that contains all stats added by qdisc callbacks. A reference
to this header is stored in the gnet_dump struct, and when all the
per-qdisc callbacks have finished adding their stats, the length of the
containing header will be adjusted to the right value.

However, on architectures that need padding (i.e., that don't set
CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS), the padding nlattr is added
before the stats, which means that the stored pointer will point to the
padding, and so when the header is fixed up, the result is just a very
big padding nlattr. Because most qdiscs also supply the legacy TCA_STATS
struct, this problem has been mostly invisible, but we exposed it with
the netlink attribute-based statistics in CAKE.

Fix the issue by fixing up the stored pointer if it points to a padding
nlattr.
