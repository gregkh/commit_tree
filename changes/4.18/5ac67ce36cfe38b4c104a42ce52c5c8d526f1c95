mtd: move code adding (registering) partitions to the parse_mtd_partitions()

This commit slightly simplifies the code. Every parse_mtd_partitions()
caller (out of two existing ones) had to add partitions & cleanup parser
on its own. This moves that responsibility into the function.

That change also allows dropping struct mtd_partitions argument.

There is one minor behavior change caused by this cleanup. If
parse_mtd_partitions() fails to add partitions (add_mtd_partitions()
return an error) then mtd_device_parse_register() will still try to
add (register) fallback partitions. It's a real corner case affecting
one of uncommon error paths and shouldn't cause any harm.
