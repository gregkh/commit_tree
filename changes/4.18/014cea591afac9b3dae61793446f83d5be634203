ALSA: xen-front: fix unsigned error check on return from to_sndif_format

The negative error return from the call to to_sndif_format is being
assigned to an unsigned 8 bit integer and hence the check for a negative
value is always going to be false.  Fix this by using ret as the error
return and hence the negative error can be detected and assign
the u8 sndif_format to ret if there is no error.
