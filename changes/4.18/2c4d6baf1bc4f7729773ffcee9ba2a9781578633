ACPI / EC: Use ec_no_wakeup on more Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th systems

The ec_no_wakeup matcher added for Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th gen systems
beyond matched only a single DMI model (20KGS3JF01), that didn't cover
my laptop (20KH002JUS). Change to match based on DMI product family to
cover all X1 6th gen systems.
