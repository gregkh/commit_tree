bpf: add helper for getting xfrm states

This commit introduces a helper which allows fetching xfrm state
parameters by eBPF programs attached to TC.

Prototype:
bpf_skb_get_xfrm_state(skb, index, xfrm_state, size, flags)

skb: pointer to skb
index: the index in the skb xfrm_state secpath array
xfrm_state: pointer to 'struct bpf_xfrm_state'
size: size of 'struct bpf_xfrm_state'
flags: reserved for future extensions

The helper returns 0 on success. Non zero if no xfrm state at the index
is found - or non exists at all.

struct bpf_xfrm_state currently includes the SPI, peer IPv4/IPv6
address and the reqid; it can be further extended by adding elements to
its end - indicating the populated fields by the 'size' argument -
keeping backwards compatibility.

Typical usage:

struct bpf_xfrm_state x = {};
bpf_skb_get_xfrm_state(skb, 0, &x, sizeof(x), 0);
