drm/sun4i: link in front-end code if needed

When the base sun4i DRM driver is built-in but the back-end is
a loadable module, we run into a link error:

drivers/gpu/drm/sun4i/sun4i_drv.o: In function `sun4i_drv_probe':
sun4i_drv.c:(.text+0x60c): undefined reference to `sun4i_frontend_of_table'

The dependency is a bit tricky, the best workaround I have come up
with is to use a Makefile hack to to interpret both
CONFIG_DRM_SUN4I_BACKEND=m and CONFIG_DRM_SUN4I_BACKEND=y
as a directive to build the front-end the same way as the main module.
