libata: Make ata_dev_set_mode() less verbose

For a successful setting of the device transfer speed mode in
ata_dev_set_mode(), do not print the message
"ataX.XX: configured for xxx" if the EH context has the quiet flag set,
unless the device port is being reset.

This preserves the output of the message during device scan but removes
it in the case of a simple device revalidation such as trigerred by
enabling the NCQ I/O priority feature of the device
e.g. echo 1 > /sys/block/sdxx/device/ncq_iprio_enable
