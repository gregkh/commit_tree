KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Add emulation for trechkpt.

This patch adds host emulation when guest PR KVM executes "trechkpt.",
which is a privileged instruction and will trap into host.

We firstly copy vcpu ongoing content into vcpu tm checkpoint
content, then perform kvmppc_restore_tm_pr() to do trechkpt.
with updated vcpu tm checkpoint values.
