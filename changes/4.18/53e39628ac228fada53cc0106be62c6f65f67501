i2c: qup: fix building without CONFIG_ACPI

The added Centriq support broke compilation with CONFIG_ACPI disabled:

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-qup.c: In function 'qup_i2c_probe':
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-qup.c:1707:25: error: 'qup_i2c_acpi_match' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'qup_i2c_recv_data'?

This fixes it by removing the extraneous #ifdef. All ACPI specific
code will be dropped implicitly when that option is disabled, but
the compiler first needs to see it.
