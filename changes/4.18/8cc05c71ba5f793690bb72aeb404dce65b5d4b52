locking/lockdep: Move sanity check to inside lockdep_print_held_locks()

Calling lockdep_print_held_locks() on a running thread is considered unsafe.

Since all callers should follow that rule and the sanity check is not heavy,
this patch moves the sanity check to inside lockdep_print_held_locks().

As a side effect of this patch, the number of locks held by running threads
will be printed as well. This change will be preferable when we want to
know which threads might be relevant to a problem but are unable to print
any clues because that thread is running.
