btrfs: incremental send, improve rmdir performance for large directory

Currently when checking if a directory can be deleted, we always check
if all its children have been processed.

Example: A directory with 2,000,000 files was deleted

original: 1994m57.071s
patch:       1m38.554s

[FIX]
Instead of checking all children on all calls to can_rmdir(), we keep
track of the directory index offset of the child last checked in the
last call to can_rmdir(), and then use it as the starting point for
future calls to can_rmdir().
