bpf: Use option "help" in the llvm-objcopy test

I noticed the "--version" option of the llvm-objcopy command has recently
disappeared from the master llvm branch.  It is currently used as a BTF
support test in tools/testing/selftests/bpf/Makefile.

This patch replaces it with "--help" which should be
less error prone in the future.
