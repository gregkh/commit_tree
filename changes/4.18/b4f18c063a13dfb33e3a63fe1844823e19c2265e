arm64: KVM: Handle guest's ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 requests

In order to forward the guest's ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 calls to EL3,
add a small(-ish) sequence to handle it at EL2. Special care must
be taken to track the state of the guest itself by updating the
workaround flags. We also rely on patching to enable calls into
the firmware.

Note that since we need to execute branches, this always executes
after the Spectre-v2 mitigation has been applied.
