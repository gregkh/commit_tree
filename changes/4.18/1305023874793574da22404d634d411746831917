staging: lustre: llite: eat -EEXIST on setting trusted.lov

Tools like rsync, tar, cp may copy and restore the xattrs on a file.
The client previously ignored the setting of trusted.lov/lustre.lov
if the layout had already been specified, to avoid causing these
tools to fail for no reason.

For PFL files we still need to silently eat -EEXIST on setting these
attributes to avoid problems.
