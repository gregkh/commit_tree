md/raid5: Assigning NULL to sh->batch_head before testing bit R5_Overlap of a stripe

In add_stripe_bio(), if the stripe_head is in batch list, the incoming
bio is regarded as overlapping, and the bit R5_Overlap on this stripe_head
is set. break_stripe_batch_list() checks bit R5_Overlap on each stripe_head
first then assigns NULL to sh->batch_head.

If break_stripe_batch_list() checks bit R5_Overlap on stripe_head A
after add_stripe_bio() finds stripe_head A is in batch list and before
add_stripe_bio() sets bit R5_Overlapt of stripe_head A,
break_stripe_batch_list() would not know there's a process in
wait_for_overlap and needs to call wake_up(). There's a huge chance a
process never returns from schedule() if add_stripe_bio() is called
from raid5_make_request().

In break_stripe_batch_list(), assigning NULL to sh->batch_head should
be done before it checks bit R5_Overlap of a stripe_head.
