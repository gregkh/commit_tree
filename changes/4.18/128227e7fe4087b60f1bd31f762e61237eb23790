slab: __GFP_ZERO is incompatible with a constructor

__GFP_ZERO requests that the object be initialised to all-zeroes, while
the purpose of a constructor is to initialise an object to a particular
pattern.  We cannot do both.  Add a warning to catch any users who
mistakenly pass a __GFP_ZERO flag when allocating a slab with a
constructor.
