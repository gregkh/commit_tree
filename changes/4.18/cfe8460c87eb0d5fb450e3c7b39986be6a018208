selftests: lib.mk: Include test suite name in the RUN_TESTS output

Currently just the test name is printed in the RUN_TESTS output. For
example, when raw_skew sub-test from timers tests in run, the output
shows just raw_skew. Include main test name when printing sub-test
results.

In addition, remove duplicate strings for printing common information
with a new for the test header information.
