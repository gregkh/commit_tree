ipconfig: BOOTP: Don't request IEN-116 name servers

When ipconfig is autoconfigured via BOOTP, the request packet
initialised by ic_bootp_init_ext() allocates 8 bytes for tag 5 ("Name
Server" [1, ยง3.7]), but tag 5 in the response isn't processed by
ic_do_bootp_ext(). Instead, allocate the 8 bytes to tag 6 ("Domain Name
Server" [1, ยง3.8]), which is processed by ic_do_bootp_ext(), and appears
to have been the intended tag to request.

This won't cause any breakage for existing users, as tag 5 responses
provided by BOOTP servers weren't being processed anyway.
