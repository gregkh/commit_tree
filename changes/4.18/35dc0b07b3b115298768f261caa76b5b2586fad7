scsi: isci: remove redundant check on in_connection_align_insertion_frequency

The sanity check on u->in_connection_align_insertion_frequency is being
performed twice and hence the first check can be removed since it is
redundant. Cleans up cppcheck warning:

drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi/ibmvscsi.c:1711: (warning) Identical inner 'if'
condition is always true.
