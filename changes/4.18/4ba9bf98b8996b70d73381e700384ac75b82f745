mmc: sdhci-msm: Remove NO_CARD_NO_RESET quirk

Now we have a proper implementation for the power irq handling and this
quirk is not needed anymore. In fact, it is causing card detection delays
on apq8096 platforms and the following error is displayed:
sdhci_msm 74a4900.sdhci: mmc0: pwr_irq for req: (4) timed out

The quirk is forcing the controller to retain 1.8V signalling on the slot
even when a new card is inserted, which is not correct. The proper behavior
would be to reset the controller in order to start with 3.3V signaling.

Fixes: c0309b3803fe ("mmc: sdhci-msm: Add sdhci msm register write APIs which wait for pwr irq")
