media: vsp1: Protect bodies against overflow

The body write function relies on the code never asking it to write more
than the entries available in the list.

Currently with each list body containing 256 entries, this is fine, but
we can reduce this number greatly saving memory. In preparation of this
add a level of protection to catch any buffer overflows.
