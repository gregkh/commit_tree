tools/power turbostat: track thread ID in cpu_topology

The code can be simplified if the cpu_topology *cpus tracks the thread
IDs.  This removes an additional file lookup and simplifies the counter
initialization code.

Add thread ID to cpu_topology information and cleanup the counter
initialization code.

v2: prevent thread_id from being overwritten
