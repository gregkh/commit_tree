bpf: btf: Introduce BTF ID

This patch gives an ID to each loaded BTF.  The ID is allocated by
the idr like the existing prog-id and map-id.

The bpf_put(map->btf) is moved to __bpf_map_put() so that the
userspace can stop seeing the BTF ID ASAP when the last BTF
refcnt is gone.

It also makes BTF accessible from userspace through the
1. new BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID command.  It is limited to CAP_SYS_ADMIN
   which is inline with the BPF_BTF_LOAD cmd and the existing
   BPF_[MAP|PROG]_GET_FD_BY_ID cmd.
2. new btf_id (and btf_key_id + btf_value_id) in "struct bpf_map_info"

Once the BTF ID handler is accessible from userspace, freeing a BTF
object has to go through a rcu period.  The BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID cmd
can then be done under a rcu_read_lock() instead of taking
spin_lock.
[Note: A similar rcu usage can be done to the existing
       bpf_prog_get_fd_by_id() in a follow up patch]

When processing the BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID cmd,
refcount_inc_not_zero() is needed because the BTF object
could be already in the rcu dead row .  btf_get() is
removed since its usage is currently limited to btf.c
alone.  refcount_inc() is used directly instead.
