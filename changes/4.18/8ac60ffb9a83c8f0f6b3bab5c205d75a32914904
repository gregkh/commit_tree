net: stmmac: Avoid VLA usage

In the quest to remove all stack VLAs from the kernel[1], this switches
the "status" stack buffer to use the existing small (8) upper bound on
how many queues can be checked for DMA, and adds a sanity-check just to
make sure it doesn't operate under pathological conditions.
