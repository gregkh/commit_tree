cgroup: Explicitly remove core interface files

The "cgroup." core interface files bypass the usual interface removal
path and get removed recursively along with the cgroup itself.  While
this works now, the subtle discrepancy gets in the way of implementing
common mechanisms.

This patch updates cgroup core interface file handling so that it's
consistent with controller interface files.  When added, the css is
marked CSS_VISIBLE and they're explicitly removed before the cgroup is
destroyed.

This doesn't cause user-visible behavior changes.
