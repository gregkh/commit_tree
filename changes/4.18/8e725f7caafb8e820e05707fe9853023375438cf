cxgb4: update LE-TCAM collection for T6

For T6, clip table is separated from main TCAM. So, update LE-TCAM
collection logic to collect clip table TCAM as well. IPv6 takes
4 entries in clip table TCAM compared to 2 entries in main TCAM.

Also, in case of errors, keep LE-TCAM collected so far and set the
status to partial dump.
