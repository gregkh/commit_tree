afs: Fix a Sparse warning in xdr_decode_AFSFetchStatus()

Sparse doesn't appear able to handle the conditionally-taken locks in
xdr_decode_AFSFetchStatus(), even though the lock and unlock are both
contingent on the same unvarying function argument.

Deal with this by interpolating a wrapper function that takes the lock if
needed and calls xdr_decode_AFSFetchStatus() on two separate branches, one
with the lock held and one without.

This allows Sparse to work out the locking.
