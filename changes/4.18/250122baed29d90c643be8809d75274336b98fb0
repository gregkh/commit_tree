powerpc64/module: Tighten detection of mcount call sites with -mprofile-kernel

For R_PPC64_REL24 relocations, we suppress emitting instructions for TOC
load/restore in the relocation stub if the relocation is for _mcount()
call when using -mprofile-kernel ABI.

To detect this, we check if the preceding instructions are per the
standard set of instructions emitted by gcc: either the two instruction
sequence of 'mflr r0; std r0,16(r1)', or the more optimized variant of a
single 'mflr r0'. This is not sufficient since nothing prevents users
from hand coding sequences involving a 'mflr r0' followed by a 'bl'.

For removing the toc save instruction from the stub, we additionally
check if the symbol is "_mcount". Add the same check here as well.

Also rename is_early_mcount_callsite() to is_mprofile_mcount_callsite()
since that is what is being checked. The use of "early" is misleading
since there is nothing involving this function that qualifies as early.
