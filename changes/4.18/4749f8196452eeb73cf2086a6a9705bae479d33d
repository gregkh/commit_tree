perf/x86/intel/uncore: Correct fixed counter index check in generic code

There is no index which is bigger than UNCORE_PMC_IDX_FIXED. The only
exception is client IMC uncore, which has been specially handled.
For generic code, it is not correct to use >= to check fixed counter.
The code quality issue will bring problem when a new counter index is
introduced.
