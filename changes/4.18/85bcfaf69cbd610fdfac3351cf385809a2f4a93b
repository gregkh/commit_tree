powerpc/64s/radix: optimise pte_update

Implementing pte_update with pte_xchg (which uses cmpxchg) is
inefficient. A single larx/stcx. works fine, no need for the less
efficient cmpxchg sequence.

Then remove the memory barriers from the operation. There is a
requirement for TLB flushing to load mm_cpumask after the store
that reduces pte permissions, which is moved into the TLB flush
code.
