r8169: don't display tp->mmio_addr address

For security reasons since commit ad67b74d2469 "printk: hash addresses
printed with %p" %p doesn't display the full address any longer.
We could switch to %px, but I think the pointer address doesn't
provide a real benefit, so remove printing the hashed address.
