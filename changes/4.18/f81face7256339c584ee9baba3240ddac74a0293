scsi: cxlflash: Introduce OCXL context state machine

In order to protect the OCXL hardware contexts from getting clobbered, a
simple state machine is added to indicate when a context is in open, close or
start state. The expected states are validated throughout the code to prevent
illegal operations on a context. A mutex is added to protect writes to the
context state field.
