serial: 8250_dw: Fix runtime PM handling

When using kgdb, you get an abort when accessing the UART registers.
This is because the driver has already entered runtime PM and so turned
off the bus clock needed to access the registers.

To fix this, set the capability indicating Runtime PM is active while idle.
