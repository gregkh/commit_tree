x86/mm: Stop pretending pgtable_l5_enabled is a variable

pgtable_l5_enabled is defined using cpu_feature_enabled() but we refer
to it as a variable. This is misleading.

Make pgtable_l5_enabled() a function.

We cannot literally define it as a function due to circular dependencies
between header files. Function-alike macros is close enough.
