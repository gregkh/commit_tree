overflow.h: Add allocation size calculation helpers

In preparation for replacing unchecked overflows for memory allocations,
this creates helpers for the 3 most common calculations:

array_size(a, b): 2-dimensional array
array3_size(a, b, c): 3-dimensional array
struct_size(ptr, member, n): struct followed by n-many trailing members

Each of these return SIZE_MAX on overflow instead of wrapping around.

(Additionally renames a variable named "array_size" to avoid future
collision.)
