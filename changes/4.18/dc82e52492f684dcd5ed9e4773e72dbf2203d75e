ALSA: core: Assure control device to be registered at last

The commit 289ca025ee1d ("ALSA: Use priority list for managing device
list") changed the way to register/disconnect/free devices via a
single priority list.  This helped to make behavior consistent, but it
also changed a slight behavior change: namely, the control device is
registered earlier than others, while it was supposed to be the very
last one.

I've put SNDRV_DEV_CONTROL in the current position as the release of
ctl elements often conflict with the private ctl elements some PCM or
other components may create, which often leads to a double-free.
But, the order of register and disconnect should be indeed fixed as
expected in the early days: the control device gets registered at
last, and disconnected at first.

This patch changes the priority list order to move SNDRV_DEV_CONTROL
as the last guy to assure the register / disconnect order.  Meanwhile,
for keeping the messy resource release order, manually treat the
control and lowlevel devices as last freed one.

Additional note:
The lowlevel device is the device where a card driver creates at
probe.  And, we still keep the release order control -> lowlevel, as
there might  be link from a control element back to a lowlevel object.
