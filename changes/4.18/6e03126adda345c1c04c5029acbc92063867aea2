Bluetooth: btqca: Add AR3002 rampatch support

This patch adds rampatch download compatibility for ROME >= 3.2.
Starting with ROME 3.2, the 'download mode' field of the rampatch
header indicates if the controller acknowledges (or not) the received
rampatch segments. If not, we need to send all the segments without
expecting any event from the controller (except for the last segment).
Goal is (I assume) to speed-up rampatch download.

This fixes BT on Dragonboard-600c P2 which includes the following BT
controller:
