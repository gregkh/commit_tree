net/mlx5: Add source e-switch owner

The source e-switch owner allows a vport on one e-switch port be associated
with a rule defined on the second port e-switch.

The role of the source eswitch owner valid bit in the flow group is to
allow the firmware fail driver attempts to wild card the source eswitch
match field. If this bit is not set, the firmware ignores the source
eswitch owner field totally.
