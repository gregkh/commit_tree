time: Add an asm-generic/compat.h file

We have a couple of files that try to include asm/compat.h on
architectures where this is available. Those should generally use the
higher-level linux/compat.h file, but that in turn fails to include
asm/compat.h when CONFIG_COMPAT is disabled, unless we can provide
that header on all architectures.

This adds the asm/compat.h for all remaining architectures to
simplify the dependencies.

Architectures that are getting removed in linux-4.17 are not changed
here, to avoid needless conflicts with the removal patches. Those
architectures are broken by this patch, but we have already shown
that they have no users.
