tcp: account lost retransmit after timeout

The previous approach for the lost and retransmit bits was to
wipe the slate clean: zero all the lost and retransmit bits,
correspondingly zero the lost_out and retrans_out counters, and
then add back the lost bits (and correspondingly increment lost_out).

The new approach is to treat this very much like marking packets
lost in fast recovery. We donâ€™t wipe the slate clean. We just say
that for all packets that were not yet marked sacked or lost, we now
mark them as lost in exactly the same way we do for fast recovery.

This fixes the lost retransmit accounting at RTO time and greatly
simplifies the RTO code by sharing much of the logic with Fast
Recovery.
