ASoC: cirrus: i2s: Fix {TX|RX}LinCtrlData setup

According to "EP93xx Userâ€™s Guide", I2STXLinCtrlData and I2SRXLinCtrlData
registers actually have different format. The only currently used bit
(Left_Right_Justify) has different position. Fix this and simplify the
whole setup taking into account the fact that both registers have zero
default value.

The practical effect of the above is repaired SND_SOC_DAIFMT_RIGHT_J
support (currently unused).
