tcp: add tcp_ooo_try_coalesce() helper

In case skb in out_or_order_queue is the result of
multiple skbs coalescing, we would like to get a proper gso_segs
counter tracking, so that future tcp_drop() can report an accurate
number.

I chose to not implement this tracking for skbs in receive queue,
since they are not dropped, unless socket is disconnected.
