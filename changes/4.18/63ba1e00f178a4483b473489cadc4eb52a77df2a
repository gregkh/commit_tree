serial: sh-sci: Support for HSCIF RX sampling point adjustment

HSCIF has facilities that allow moving the RX sampling point by between
-8 and 7 sampling cycles (one sampling cycles equals 1/15 of a bit
by default) to improve the error margin in case of slightly mismatched
bit rates between sender and receiver.

This patch tries to determine if shifting the sampling point can improve
the error margin and will enable it if so.
