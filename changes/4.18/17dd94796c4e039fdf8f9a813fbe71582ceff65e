i2c: rk3x: Don't print visible virtual mapping MMIO address

Now %p doesn't print visible pointer address unless the user
really want it. According to Documentation/core-api/printk-formats.rst,
%px should be used instead, otherwise we could see:

rk3x-i2c ff110000.i2c: Initialized RK3xxx I2C bus at (____ptrval____)
rk3x-i2c ff130000.i2c: Initialized RK3xxx I2C bus at (____ptrval____)
rk3x-i2c ff3c0000.i2c: Initialized RK3xxx I2C bus at (____ptrval____)
rk3x-i2c ff3d0000.i2c: Initialized RK3xxx I2C bus at (____ptrval____)

But I don't really understand why we need dump it in the first place!
Let's remove the whole pointless log.
