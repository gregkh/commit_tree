block: remove parent device reference from struct bsg_class_device

Bsg holding a reference to the parent device may result in a crash if a
bsg file handle is closed after the parent device driver has unloaded.

Holding a reference is not really needed: the parent device must exist
between bsg_register_queue and bsg_unregister_queue.  Before the device
goes away the caller does blk_cleanup_queue so that all in-flight
requests to the device are gone and all new requests cannot pass beyond
the queue.  The queue itself is a refcounted object and it will stay
alive with a bsg file.

Based on analysis, previous patch and changelog from Anatoliy Glagolev.
