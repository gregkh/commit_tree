There is a hole that mm can flush all dirty pages of volatile file as
inode is not tagged with both FI_VOLATILE_FILE and FI_DROP_CACHE flags,
we should never writeback the page #0 and also it's unneeded to writeback
other pages.

This patch adjusts to relocate clear_inode_flag(FI_VOLATILE_FILE), so that
FI_VOLATILE_FILE flag can be remained before all dirty pages were dropped
to avoid issue.
