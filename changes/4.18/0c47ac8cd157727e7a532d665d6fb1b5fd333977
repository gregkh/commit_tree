ARM: KVM: invalidate icache on guest exit for Cortex-A15

In order to avoid aliasing attacks against the branch predictor
on Cortex-A15, let's invalidate the BTB on guest exit, which can
only be done by invalidating the icache (with ACTLR[0] being set).

We use the same hack as for A12/A17 to perform the vector decoding.
