usb: storage: Replace mdelay with msleep in init_freecom

init_freecom() is never called in atomic context.

init_freecom() is set as ".initFunction" through UNUSUAL_DEV().
And ->initFunction() is only called by usb_stor_acquire_resources(),
which is only called by usb_stor_probe2().
usb_stor_probe2() is called by *_probe() functions (like alauda_probe())
for each USB driver.
*_probe() functions are set ".probe" in struct usb_driver.
These functions are not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, init_freecom()
calls mdelay() to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with msleep() to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
