scsi: qla2xxx: Mask off Scope bits in retry delay

Some newer target uses "Status Qualifier" response in a returned "Busy
Status". This new response code of 0x4001, which is "Scope" bits,
translates to "Affects all units accessible by target".  Due to this new
value returned in the Scope bits, driver was using that value as timeout
value which resulted into driver waiting for 27min timeout.

This patch masks off this Scope bits so that driver does not use this
value as retry delay time.
