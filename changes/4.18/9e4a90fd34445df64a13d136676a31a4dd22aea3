x86/dumpstack: Improve opcodes dumping in the code section

The code used to iterate byte-by-byte over the bytes around RIP and that
is expensive: disabling pagefaults around it, copy_from_user, etc...

Make it read the whole buffer of OPCODE_BUFSIZE size in one go. Use a
statically allocated 64 bytes buffer so that concurrent show_opcodes()
do not interleave in the output even though in the majority of the cases
it's serialized via die_lock. Except the #PF path which doesn't...

Also, do the PAGE_OFFSET check outside of the function because latter
will be reused in other context.
