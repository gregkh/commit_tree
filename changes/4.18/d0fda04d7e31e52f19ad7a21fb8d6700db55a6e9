i40e/i40evf: take into account queue map from vf when handling queues

The expectation of the ops VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES and
VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES is that the queue map sent by
the VF is taken into account when enabling/disabling
queues in the VF VSI. This patch makes sure that happens.

By breaking out the individual queue set up functions so
that they can be called directly from the i40e_virtchnl_pf.c
file, only the queues as specified by the queue bit map that
accompanies the enable/disable queues ops will be handled.
