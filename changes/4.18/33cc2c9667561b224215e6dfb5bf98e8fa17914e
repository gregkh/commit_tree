acpi, nfit: Fix scrub idle detection

The notification of scrub completion happens within the scrub workqueue.
That can clearly race someone running scrub_show() and work_busy()
before the workqueue has a chance to flush the recently completed work.
Add a flag to reliably indicate the idle vs busy state. Without this
change applications using poll(2) to wait for scrub-completion may
falsely wakeup and read ARS as being busy even though the thread is
going idle and then hang indefinitely.
