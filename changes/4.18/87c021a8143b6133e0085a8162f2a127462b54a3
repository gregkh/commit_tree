arm64/sve: Thin out initialisation sanity-checks for sve_max_vl

Now that the kernel SVE support is reasonably mature, it is
excessive to default sve_max_vl to the invalid value -1 and then
sprinkle WARN_ON()s around the place to make sure it has been
initialised before use.  The cpufeatures code already runs pretty
early, and will ensure sve_max_vl gets initialised.

This patch initialises sve_max_vl to something sane that will be
supported by every SVE implementation, and removes most of the
sanity checks.

The checks in find_supported_vector_length() are retained for now.
If anything goes horribly wrong, we are likely to trip a check here
sooner or later.
