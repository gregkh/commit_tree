arm: shmobile: Change platform dependency to ARCH_RENESAS

Since commit 9b5ba0df4ea4f940 ("ARM: shmobile: Introduce ARCH_RENESAS")
ARCH_RENESAS is a more appropriate platform dependency than the legacy
ARCH_SHMOBILE, hence use the former.

This will allow to drop ARCH_SHMOBILE on ARM in the near future.
