bpf: show prog and map id in fdinfo

Its trivial and straight forward to expose it for scripts that can
then use it along with bpftool in order to inspect an individual
application's used maps and progs. Right now we dump some basic
information in the fdinfo file but with the help of the map/prog
id full introspection becomes possible now.
