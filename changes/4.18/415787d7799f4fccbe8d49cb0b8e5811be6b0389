ipv6: frags: fix a lockdep false positive

lockdep does not know that the locks used by IPv4 defrag
and IPv6 reassembly units are of different classes.

It complains because of following chains :

1) sch_direct_xmit()        (lock txq->_xmit_lock)
    dev_hard_start_xmit()
     xmit_one()
      dev_queue_xmit_nit()
       packet_rcv_fanout()
        ip_check_defrag()
         ip_defrag()
          spin_lock()     (lock frag queue spinlock)

2) ip6_input_finish()
    ipv6_frag_rcv()       (lock frag queue spinlock)
     ip6_frag_queue()
      icmpv6_param_prob() (lock txq->_xmit_lock at some point)

We could add lockdep annotations, but we also can make sure IPv6
calls icmpv6_param_prob() only after the release of the frag queue spinlock,
since this naturally makes frag queue spinlock a leaf in lock hierarchy.
