ALSA: hda/ca0132: R3Di and SBZ quirk entires + alt firmware loading

This patch adds PCI quirk ID's for the Sound Blaster Z and Recon3Di.
Only the currently tested ID's have been added.

This patch also adds the ability to load alternative firmwares for each
card, the firmwares can be obtained from within the Windows driver.
The Recon3Di uses "ctefx-r3di.bin" and the Sound Blaster Z uses
"ctefx-sbz.bin". If the alternative firmware for the given quirk is not
found, the original ctefx.bin will be used. This has been confirmed to
work for both the R3Di and the SBZ.

This patch also makes the character array *dirstr a const.
