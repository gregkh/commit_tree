media: docs: clarify relationship between crop and selection APIs

Having two somewhat similar and largely overlapping APIs is confusing,
especially since the older one appears in the docs before the newer
and most featureful counterpart.

Clarify all of this in several ways:
 - swap the two sections
 - give a name to the two APIs in the section names
 - add a note at the beginning of the CROP API section
 - update note about VIDIOC_CROPCAP

Also remove a note that is incorrect (correct wording is in
vidioc-cropcap.rst).
