net: pskb_trim_rcsum() and CHECKSUM_COMPLETE are friends

After working on IP defragmentation lately, I found that some large
packets defeat CHECKSUM_COMPLETE optimization because of NIC adding
zero paddings on the last (small) fragment.

While removing the padding with pskb_trim_rcsum(), we set skb->ip_summed
to CHECKSUM_NONE, forcing a full csum validation, even if all prior
fragments had CHECKSUM_COMPLETE set.

We can instead compute the checksum of the part we are trimming,
usually smaller than the part we keep.
