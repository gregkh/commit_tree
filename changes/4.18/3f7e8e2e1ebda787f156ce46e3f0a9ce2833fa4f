ARM: KVM: invalidate BTB on guest exit for Cortex-A12/A17

In order to avoid aliasing attacks against the branch predictor,
let's invalidate the BTB on guest exit. This is made complicated
by the fact that we cannot take a branch before invalidating the
BTB.

We only apply this to A12 and A17, which are the only two ARM
cores on which this useful.
