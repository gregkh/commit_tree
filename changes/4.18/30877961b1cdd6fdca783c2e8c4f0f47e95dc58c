ipvlan: fix IFLA_MTU ignored on NEWLINK

Commit 296d48568042 ("ipvlan: inherit MTU from master device") adjusted
the mtu from the master device when creating a ipvlan device, but it
would also override the mtu value set in rtnl_create_link. It causes
IFLA_MTU param not to take effect.

So this patch is to not adjust the mtu if IFLA_MTU param is set when
creating a ipvlan device.
