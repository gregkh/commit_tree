backlight: tps65217_bl: Fix Device Tree node lookup

Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
on its children.

This would only cause trouble if the child node is missing while there
is an unrelated node named "backlight" elsewhere in the tree.
