bpf, arm32: fix to use bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro api

Any eBPF JIT that where its underlying arch supports ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY
would need to use bpf_jit_binary_{un,}lock_ro() pair instead of the
set_memory_{ro,rw}() pair directly as otherwise changes to the former
might break. arm32's eBPF conversion missed to change it, so fix this
up here.
