ixgbe: Move ipsec init function to before reset call

This patch moves the IPsec init function in ixgbe_sw_init. This way it is a
bit more consistent with the placement of similar initialization functions
and is placed before the reset_hw call which should allow us to clean up
any link issues that may be introduced by the fact that we force the link
up if somehow the device had IPsec still enabled before the driver was
loaded.

In addition to the function move it is necessary to change the assignment
of netdev->features. The easiest way to do this is to just test for the
existence of adapter->ipsec and if it is present we set the feature bits.
