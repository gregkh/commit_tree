drm/i915: Push irq_shift from gen8_cs_irq_handler() to caller

Originally we were inlining gen8_cs_irq_handler() and so expected the
compiler to constant-fold away the irq_shift (so we had hardcoded it as
opposed to use engine->irq_shift). However, we dropped the inline given
the proliferation of gen8_cs_irq_handler()s. If we pull the shifting
of the iir into the caller, we can shrink the code still further:

add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/3 up/down: 0/-34 (-34)
Function                                     old     new   delta
gen8_cs_irq_handler                          123     118      -5
gen8_gt_irq_handler                          261     248     -13
gen11_irq_handler                            722     706     -16

v2: Drop gen11_cs_irq_handler now that it is a simple
stub around gen8_cs_irq_handler (Daniele)
