btrfs: fix use-after-free of cmp workspace pages

btrfs_cmp_data_free() puts cmp's src_pages and dst_pages, but leaves
their page address intact. Now, if you hit "goto again" in
btrfs_extent_same_range() and hit some error in
btrfs_cmp_data_prepare(), you'll try to unlock/put already put pages.

This is simple fix to reset the address to avoid use-after-free.
