arm_pmu: simplify arm_pmu::handle_irq

The arm_pmu::handle_irq() callback has the same prototype as a generic
IRQ handler, taking the IRQ number and a void pointer argument which it
must convert to an arm_pmu pointer.

This means that all arm_pmu::handle_irq() take an IRQ number they never
use, and all must explicitly cast the void pointer to an arm_pmu
pointer.

Instead, let's change arm_pmu::handle_irq to take an arm_pmu pointer,
allowing these casts to be removed. The redundant IRQ number parameter
is also removed.
