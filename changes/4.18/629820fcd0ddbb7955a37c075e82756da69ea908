drm/i915: Show GEM_TRACE when detecting a failed GPU idle

If we timeout waiting for the GPU to idle, something went seriously
wrong. We currently dump the engine state, but we can also dump the
ftrace buffer showing our last operations (when available).

In passing, note that since commit 559e040f1f08 ("drm/i915: Show the GPU
state when declaring wedged", we now show the engine state twice, once
in detecting the failed idle and then again on declaring wedged.

v2: ftrace_dump() takes a parameter specifying whether to dump all cpu
buffers or the local cpu's.
