drm/i915: Don't fiddle with rps/rc6 across GPU reset

Resetting the GPU doesn't affect the RPS/RC6 state, so we can stop
forcibly reloading the registers.

Ville suggested this many moons ago, I said at that time that sanitizing
was no harm and meant that our bookkeeping was kept consistent with the
HW. However, in a forthcoming series, we want to split rps/rc6 GT
powermanagement and one of the key simplifications is the control of
when we enable it. Performing a crude sanitize in the middle of
i915_gem_reset() is then a huge wart.
