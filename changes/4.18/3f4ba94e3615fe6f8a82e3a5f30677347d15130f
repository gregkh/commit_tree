ACPI: APD: Add AMD misc clock handler support

AMD SoC exposes clock for general purpose use. The clock registration
is done in clk-st driver. The MMIO mapping are passed on to the
clock driver for accessing the registers.
The misc clock handler will create MMIO mappings to access the
clock registers and enable the clock driver to expose the clock
for use of drivers which will connect to it.
