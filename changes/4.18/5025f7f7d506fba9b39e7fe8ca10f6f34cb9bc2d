rtnetlink: add rtnl_link_state check in rtnl_configure_link

rtnl_configure_link sets dev->rtnl_link_state to
RTNL_LINK_INITIALIZED and unconditionally calls
__dev_notify_flags to notify user-space of dev flags.

current call sequence for rtnl_configure_link
rtnetlink_newlink
    rtnl_link_ops->newlink
    rtnl_configure_link (unconditionally notifies userspace of
                         default and new dev flags)

If a newlink handler wants to call rtnl_configure_link
early, we will end up with duplicate notifications to
user-space.

This patch fixes rtnl_configure_link to check rtnl_link_state
and call __dev_notify_flags with gchanges = 0 if already
RTNL_LINK_INITIALIZED.

Later in the series, this patch will help the following sequence
where a driver implementing newlink can call rtnl_configure_link
to initialize the link early.

makes the following call sequence work:
rtnetlink_newlink
    rtnl_link_ops->newlink (vxlan) -> rtnl_configure_link (initializes
                                                link and notifies
                                                user-space of default
                                                dev flags)
    rtnl_configure_link (updates dev flags if requested by user ifm
                         and notifies user-space of new dev flags)
