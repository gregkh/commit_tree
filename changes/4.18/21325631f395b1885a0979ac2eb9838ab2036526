MIPS: memset.S: Reinstate delay slot indentation

Assembly language within the MIPS kernel conventionally indents
instructions which are in a branch delay slot to make them easier to
see. Commit 8483b14aaa81 ("MIPS: lib: memset: Whitespace fixes") rather
inexplicably removed all of these indentations from memset.S. Reinstate
the convention for all instructions in a branch delay slot. This
effectively reverts the above commit, plus other locations introduced
with MIPSR6 support.
