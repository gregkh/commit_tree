ALSA: hda/ca0132: Delete pointless assignments to struct auto_pin_cfg fields

ca0132_config() was setting some values in the auto_pin_cfg for
the codec... but it is called prior to snd_hda_parse_pin_defcfg(),
which does a memset() to clear the entire structure as one of its
first actions, making the entire exercise pointless.

Kill all use of struct auto_pin_cfg from ca0132_config().
