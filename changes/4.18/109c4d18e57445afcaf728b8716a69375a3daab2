drm/arm/malidp: Ensure that the crtcs are shutdown before removing any encoder/connector

One needs to ensure that the crtcs are shutdown so that the
drm_crtc_state->connector_mask reflects that no connectors
are currently active. Further, it reduces the reference
count for each connector. This ensures that the connectors
and encoders can be cleanly removed either when _unbind
is called for the corresponding drivers or by
drm_mode_config_cleanup().
We need drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() to be called before
component_unbind_all() otherwise the connectors attached to the
component device will have the wrong reference count value and will not
be cleanly removed.
