netfilter: ebtables: remove EBT_MATCH and EBT_NOMATCH

EBT_MATCH and EBT_NOMATCH are used to change return value.
match functions(ebt_xxx.c) return false when received frame is not matched
and returns true when received frame is matched.
but, EBT_MATCH_ITERATE understands oppositely.
so, to change return value, EBT_MATCH and EBT_NOMATCH are used.
but, we can use operation '!' simply.
