MAINTAINERS: Add myself as a co-maintainer for the locking subsystem

I've been heavily involved with concurrency and memory ordering stuff
(see ATOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE and LINUX KERNEL MEMORY CONSISTENCY MODEL)
and with arm64 now using qrwlock with a view to using qspinlock in the
near future, I'm going to continue being involved with the core locking
primitives. Reflect this by adding myself as a co-maintainer alongside
Ingo and Peter.
