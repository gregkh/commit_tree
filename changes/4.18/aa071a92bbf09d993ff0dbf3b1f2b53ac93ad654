usb: hub: Per-port setting to reduce TRSTRCY to 10 ms

Currently, the USB hub core waits for 50 ms after enumerating the
device. This was added to help "some high speed devices" to
enumerate (b789696af8 "[PATCH] USB: relax usbcore reset timings").

On some devices, the time-to-active is important, so we provide
a per-port option to reduce the time to what the USB specification
requires: 10 ms.
