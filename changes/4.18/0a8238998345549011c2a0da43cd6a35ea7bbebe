igb: Add support for enabling queue steering in filters

On some igb models (82575 and i210) the MAC address filters can
control to which queue the packet will be assigned.

This extends the 'state' with one more state to signify that queue
selection should be enabled for that filter.

As 82575 parts are no longer easily obtained (and this was developed
against i210), only support for the i210 model is enabled.

These functions are exported and will be used in the next patch.
