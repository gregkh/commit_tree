x86/mm: Decouple dynamic __PHYSICAL_MASK from AMD SME

AMD SME claims one bit from physical address to indicate whether the
page is encrypted or not. To achieve that we clear out the bit from
__PHYSICAL_MASK.

The capability to adjust __PHYSICAL_MASK is required beyond AMD SME.
For instance for upcoming Intel Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption.

Factor it out into a separate feature with own Kconfig handle.

It also helps with overhead of AMD SME. It saves more than 3k in .text
on defconfig + AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT:

	add/remove: 3/2 grow/shrink: 5/110 up/down: 189/-3753 (-3564)

We would need to return to this once we have infrastructure to patch
constants in code. That's good candidate for it.
