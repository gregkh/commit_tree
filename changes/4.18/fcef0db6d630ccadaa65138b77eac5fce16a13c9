smb3: add support for posix negotiate context

Unlike CIFS where UNIX/POSIX extensions had been negotiatable,
SMB3 did not have POSIX extensions yet.  Add the new SMB3.11
POSIX negotiate context to ask the server whether it can
support POSIX (and thus whether we can send the new POSIX open
context).
