ath10k: correct target assert problem due to CE5 stuck

Correct a minor bug in the commit 0628467f97b5 ("ath10k: fix
copy engine 5 destination ring stuck") which introduced a change to fix
firmware assert that happens when ring indices of copy engine 5 are stuck
for a specific duration, problem with this fix is that it did not use
ring arithmatic. As a result,firmware asserts did not go away entirely
athough the frequency of occurrence has reduced. Using ring arithmatic
to fix the issue.

Tested on QCA9984(fw version-10.4-3.4-00082).
