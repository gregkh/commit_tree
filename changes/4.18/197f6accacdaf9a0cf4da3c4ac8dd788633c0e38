workqueue: Make sure struct worker is accessible for wq_worker_comm()

The worker struct could already be freed when wq_worker_comm() tries
to access it for reporting.  This patch protects PF_WQ_WORKER
modifications with wq_pool_attach_mutex and makes wq_worker_comm()
test the flag before dereferencing worker from kthread_data(), which
ensures that it only dereferences when the worker struct is valid.
