bpf: btf: Use exact btf value_size match in map_check_btf()

The current map_check_btf() in BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY rejects
'> map->value_size' to ensure map_seq_show_elem() will not
access things beyond an array element.

Yonghong suggested that using '!=' is a more correct
check.  The 8 bytes round_up on value_size is stored
in array->elem_size.  Hence, using '!=' on map->value_size
is a proper check.

This patch also adds new tests to check the btf array
key type and value type.  Two of these new tests verify
the btf's value_size (the change in this patch).

It also fixes two existing tests that wrongly encoded
a btf's type size (pprint_test) and the value_type_id (in one
of the raw_tests[]).  However, that do not affect these two
BTF verification tests before or after this test changes.
These two tests mainly failed at array creation time after
this patch.
