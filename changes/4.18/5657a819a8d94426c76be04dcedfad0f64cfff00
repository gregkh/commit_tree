block drivers/block: Use octal not symbolic permissions

Convert the S_<FOO> symbolic permissions to their octal equivalents as
using octal and not symbolic permissions is preferred by many as more
readable.

see: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/2/1945

Done with automated conversion via:
$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f --types=SYMBOLIC_PERMS --fix-inplace <files...>

Miscellanea:

o Wrapped modified multi-line calls to a single line where appropriate
o Realign modified multi-line calls to open parenthesis
