kbuild: LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION no -ffunction-sections/-fdata-sections for module build

Modules do not tend to cope with -ffunction-sections, even though they
do not link with -gc-sections. It may be possible for unused symbols to
be trimmed from modules, but in general that would take much more work
in architecture module linker scripts.

For now, enable these only for kernel build.
