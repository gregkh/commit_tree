wcn36xx: abort scan request when 'dequeued' indicator is sent

When the firmware sends a WCN36XX_HAL_SCAN_IND_DEQUEUED indication,
the request is apparently no longer valid. Attempts to stop the hardware
scan request subsequently will lead to the following error message, and
the hardware is no longer able to communicate with any AP:

[   57.917186] wcn36xx: ERROR hal_stop_scan_offload response failed err=5

Interpreting this indicator message as scan abortion fixes this.

While at it, add a newline to a debug print.
