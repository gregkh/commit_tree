rcu: Make rcu_gp_kthread() check for early-boot activity

The rcu_gp_kthread() function immediately sleeps waiting to be notified
of the need for a new grace period, which currently works because there
are a number of code sequences that will provide the needed wakeup later.
However, some of these code sequences need to acquire the root rcu_node
structure's ->lock, and contention on that lock has started manifesting.
This commit therefore makes rcu_gp_kthread() check for early-boot activity
when it starts up, omitting the initial sleep in that case.
