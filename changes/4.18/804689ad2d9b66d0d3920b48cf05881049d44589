libata: Fix command retry decision

For failed commands with valid sense data (e.g. NCQ commands),
scsi_check_sense() is used in ata_analyze_tf() to determine if the
command can be retried. In such case, rely on this decision and ignore
the command error mask based decision done in ata_worth_retry().

This fixes useless retries of commands such as unaligned writes on zoned
disks (TYPE_ZAC).
