bpf: make mlx4 compatible w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail

w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail helper xdp's data_end pointer could be changed as
well (only "decrease" of pointer's location is going to be supported).
changing of this pointer will change packet's size.
for mlx4 driver we will just calculate packet's length unconditionally
(the same way as it's already being done in mlx5)
