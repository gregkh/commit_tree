vfio/mdev: Check globally for duplicate devices

When we create an mdev device, we check for duplicates against the
parent device and return -EEXIST if found, but the mdev device
namespace is global since we'll link all devices from the bus.  We do
catch this later in sysfs_do_create_link_sd() to return -EEXIST, but
with it comes a kernel warning and stack trace for trying to create
duplicate sysfs links, which makes it an undesirable response.

Therefore we should really be looking for duplicates across all mdev
parent devices, or as implemented here, against our mdev device list.
Using mdev_list to prevent duplicates means that we can remove
mdev_parent.lock, but in order not to serialize mdev device creation
and removal globally, we add mdev_device.active which allows UUIDs to
be reserved such that we can drop the mdev_list_lock before the mdev
device is fully in place.

Two behavioral notes; first, mdev_parent.lock had the side-effect of
serializing mdev create and remove ops per parent device.  This was
an implementation detail, not an intentional guarantee provided to
the mdev vendor drivers.  Vendor drivers can trivially provide this
serialization internally if necessary.  Second, review comments note
the new -EAGAIN behavior when the device, and in particular the remove
attribute, becomes visible in sysfs.  If a remove is triggered prior
to completion of mdev_device_create() the user will see a -EAGAIN
error.  While the errno is different, receiving an error during this
period is not, the previous implementation returned -ENODEV for the
same condition.  Furthermore, the consistency to the user is improved
in the case where mdev_device_remove_ops() returns error.  Previously
concurrent calls to mdev_device_remove() could see the device
disappear with -ENODEV and return in the case of error.  Now a user
would see -EAGAIN while the device is in this transitory state.
