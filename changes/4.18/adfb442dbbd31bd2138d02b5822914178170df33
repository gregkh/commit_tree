cxgb4: mk_act_open_req() buggers ->{local, peer}_ip on big-endian hosts

Unlike fs.val.lport and fs.val.fport, cxgb4_process_flow_match()
sets fs.val.{l,f}ip to net-endian values without conversion - they come
straight from flow_dissector_key_ipv4_addrs ->dst and ->src resp.  So
the assignment in mk_act_open_req() ought to be a straight copy.

	As far as I know, T4 PCIe cards do exist, so it's not as if that
thing could only be found on little-endian systems...
