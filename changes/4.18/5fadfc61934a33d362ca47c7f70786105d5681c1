selftests: bpf: add missing NET_SCHED to config

CONFIG_NET_SCHED wasn't enabled in arm64's defconfig only for x86.

So bpf/test_tunnel.sh tests fails with:

  RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported
  RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported
  We have an error talking to the kernel, -1

Enable NET_SCHED and more tests pass.
