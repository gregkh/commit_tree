sparc/time: Add missing __init to init_tick_ops()

Code that was added to force gcc not to inline any function that isn't
explicitly declared as inline uncovered that init_tick_ops() isn't
marked as "__init". It is only called by __init functions and more
importantly it too calls an __init function which would require it to be
__init as well.
