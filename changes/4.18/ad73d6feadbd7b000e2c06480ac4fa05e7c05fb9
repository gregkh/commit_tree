mmc: complete requests from ->timeout

By completing the request entirely in the driver we can remove the
BLK_EH_HANDLED return value and thus the split responsibility between the
driver and the block layer that has been causing trouble.

[While this keeps existing behavior it seems to mismatch the comment,
 maintainers please chime in!]
