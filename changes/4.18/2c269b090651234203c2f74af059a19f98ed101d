dma-fence: Some kerneldoc polish for dma-fence.h

- Switch to inline member docs for dma_fence_ops.
- Mild polish all around.
- hyperlink all the things!

v2: - Remove the various [in] annotations, they seem really uncommon
in kerneldoc and look funny.

v3: Linebreak the "Returns" part of the @fill_driver_data kerneldoc
(Eric).
