drm/i915: Update ring position from request on retiring

When wedged, we do not update the ring->tail as we submit the requests
causing us to leak the ring->space upon cleaning up the wedged driver.
We can just use the value stored in rq->tail, and keep the submission
backend details away from set-wedge.
