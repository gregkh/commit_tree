drivers: nvmem: Export nvmem_add_cells()

Not all platforms use device tree. It is useful to be able to add
cells to a NVMEM device from code. Export nvmem_add_cells() so making
this possible.

This required changing the parameters a bit, so that just the cells
and the number of cells are passed, not the whole nvmem config
structure.
