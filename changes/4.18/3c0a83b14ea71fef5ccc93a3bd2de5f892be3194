perf: fix invalid bit in diagnostic entry

The s390 CPU measurement facility sampling mode supports basic entries
and diagnostic entries. Each entry has a valid bit to indicate the
status of the entry as valid or invalid.

This bit is bit 31 in the diagnostic entry, but the bit mask definition
refers to bit 30.

Fix this by making the reserved field one bit larger.
