powerpc/eeh: Cleaner handling of EEH_DEV_NO_HANDLER

If a device without a driver is recovered via EEH, the flag
EEH_DEV_NO_HANDLER is incorrectly left set on the device after
recovery, because the test in eeh_report_resume() for the existence of
a bound driver is done before the flag is cleared. If a driver is
later bound, and EEH experienced again, some of the drivers EEH
handers are not called.

To correct this, clear the flag unconditionally after EEH processing
is complete.
