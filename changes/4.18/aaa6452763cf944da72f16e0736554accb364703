bpf: fix virtio-net's length calc for XDP_PASS

In commit 6870de435b90 ("bpf: make virtio compatible w/
bpf_xdp_adjust_tail") i didn't account for vi->hdr_len during new
packet's length calculation after bpf_prog_run in receive_mergeable.
because of this all packets, if they were passed to the kernel,
were truncated by 12 bytes.
