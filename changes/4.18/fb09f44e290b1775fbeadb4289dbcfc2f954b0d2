mmc: core: Re-factor some code for SDIO re-initialization

The mmc_sdio_init_card() function has a couple of callers. In the
re-initialization cases, some additional reset commands are issued before
mmc_sdio_init_card() is called. As these additional reset commands are the
same, let's move these into a new static function, mmc_sdio_reinit_card()
and call mmc_sdio_init_card() from there. In this way we avoid the open
coding.
