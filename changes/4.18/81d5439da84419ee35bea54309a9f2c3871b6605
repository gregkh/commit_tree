cfg80211: average ack rssi support for data frames

Average ack rssi will be given to userspace via NL80211 interface
if firmware is capable. Userspace tool ‘iw’ can process this
information and give the output as one of the fields in
‘iw dev wlanX station dump’.

Example output :

localhost ~ #iw dev wlan-5000mhz station dump Station

Main use case is to measure the signal strength of a connected station
to AP. Data packet transmit rates and bandwidth used by station can vary
a lot even if the station is at fixed location, especially if the rates
used are multi stream(2stream, 3stream) rates with different bandwidth(20/40/80 Mhz).
These multi stream rates are sensitive and station can use different transmit power
for each of the rate and bandwidth combinations. RSSI measured from these RX packets
on AP will be not stable and can vary a lot with in a short time.
Whereas 802.11 ack frames from station are sent relatively at a constant
rate (6/12/24 Mbps) with constant bandwidth(20 Mhz).
So average rssi of the ack packets is good and more accurate.
