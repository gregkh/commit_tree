drm/i915: Flush submission tasklet after bumping priority

When called from process context tasklet_schedule() defers itself to
ksoftirqd. From experience this may cause unacceptable latencies of over
200ms in executing the submission tasklet, our goal is to reprioritise
the HW execution queue and trigger HW preemption immediately, so disable
bh over the call to schedule and force the tasklet to run afterwards if
scheduled.

v2: Keep rcu_read_lock() around for PREEMPT_RCU
