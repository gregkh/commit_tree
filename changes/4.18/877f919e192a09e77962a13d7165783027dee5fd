proc: add proc_seq_release

kmemleak reported some memory leak on reading proc files. After adding
some debug lines, find that proc_seq_fops is using seq_release as
release handler, which won't handle the free of 'private' field of
seq_file, while in fact the open handler proc_seq_open could create
the private data with __seq_open_private when state_size is greater
than zero. So after reading files created with proc_create_seq_private,
such as /proc/timer_list and /proc/vmallocinfo, the private mem of a
seq_file is not freed. Fix it by adding the paired proc_seq_release
as the default release handler of proc_seq_ops instead of seq_release.
