libiscsi: don't try to bypass SCSI EH

libiscsi is the only SCSI code that return BLK_EH_HANDLED, thus trying to
bypass the normal SCSI EH code.  We are going to remove this return value
at the block layer, and at least from a quick look it doesn't look too
harmful to try to send an abort for these cases, especially as the first
one should not actually be possible.  If this doesn't work out iscsi
will probably need its own eh_strategy_handler instead to just do the
right thing.
