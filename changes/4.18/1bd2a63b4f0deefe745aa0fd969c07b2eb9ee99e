x86/intel_rdt/mba_sc: Add initialization support

When MBA software controller is enabled, a per domain storage is required
for user specified bandwidth in "MBps" and the "percentage" values which
are programmed into the IA32_MBA_THRTL_MSR. Add support for these data
structures and initialization.

The MBA percentage values have a default max value of 100 but however the
max value in MBps is not available from the hardware so it's set to
U32_MAX.

This simply says that the control group can use all bandwidth by default
but does not say what is the actual max bandwidth available. The actual
bandwidth that is available may depend on lot of factors like QPI link,
number of memory channels, memory channel frequency, its width and memory
speed, how many channels are configured and also if memory interleaving is
enabled. So there is no way to determine the maximum at runtime reliably.
