HID: i2c-hid: check if device is there before really probing

On many Chromebooks touch devices are multi-sourced; the components are
electrically compatible and one can be freely swapped for another without
changing the OS image or firmware.

To avoid bunch of scary messages when device is not actually present in the
system let's try testing basic communication with it and if there is no
response terminate probe early with -ENXIO.
