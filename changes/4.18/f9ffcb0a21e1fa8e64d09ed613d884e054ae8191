media: uvcvideo: Fix driver reference counting

kref_init initializes the reference count to 1, not 0. This additional
reference is never released since the conversion to reference counters.
As a result, uvc_delete is not called anymore when UVC cameras are
disconnected.
Fix this by adding an additional kref_put in uvc_disconnect and in the
probe error path. This also allows to remove the temporary additional
reference in uvc_unregister_video.
