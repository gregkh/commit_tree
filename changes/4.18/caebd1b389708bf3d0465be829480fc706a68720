mlxsw: core_acl_flex_actions: Remove redundant mirror resource destruction

In previous patch mlxsw_afa_resource_del() was added to avoid a duplicate
resource detruction scenario.
For mirror actions, such duplicate destruction leads to a crash as in:

 # tc qdisc add dev swp49 ingress
 # tc filter add dev swp49 parent ffff: \
   protocol ip chain 100 pref 10 \
   flower skip_sw dst_ip 192.168.101.1 action drop
 # tc filter add dev swp49 parent ffff: \
   protocol ip pref 10 \
   flower skip_sw dst_ip 192.168.101.1 action goto chain 100 \
   action mirred egress mirror dev swp4

Therefore add a call to mlxsw_afa_resource_del() in
mlxsw_afa_mirror_destroy() in order to clear that resource
from rule's resources.
