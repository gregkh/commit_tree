tcp: Fix broken repair socket window probe patch

Correct previous bad attempt at allowing sockets to come out of TCP
repair without sending window probes. To avoid changing size of
the repair variable in struct tcp_sock, this lets the decision for
sending probes or not to be made when coming out of repair by
introducing two ways to turn it off.

v2:
* Remove erroneous comment; defines now make behavior clear
