drm/tegra: Acquire a reference to the IOVA cache

The IOVA API uses a memory cache to allocate IOVA nodes from. To make
sure that this cache is available, obtain a reference to it and release
the reference when the cache is no longer needed.

On 64-bit ARM this is hidden by the fact that the DMA mapping API gets
that reference and never releases it. On 32-bit ARM, however, the DMA
mapping API doesn't do that, so allocation of IOVA nodes fails.
