bpf: Define cgroup_bpf_enabled for CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=n

Static key is used to enable/disable cgroup-bpf related code paths at
run time.

Though it's not defined when cgroup-bpf is disabled at compile time,
i.e. CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=n, and if some code wants to use it, it has to do
this:

	#ifdef CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF
		if (cgroup_bpf_enabled) {
			/* ... some work ... */
		}
	#endif

This code can be simplified by setting cgroup_bpf_enabled to 0 for
CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=n case:

	if (cgroup_bpf_enabled) {
		/* ... some work ... */
	}

And it aligns well with existing BPF_CGROUP_RUN_PROG_* macros that
defined for both states of CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF.
