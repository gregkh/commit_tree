drm/qxl: Call qxl_bo_unref outside atomic context

"qxl_bo_unref" may sleep, but calling "qxl_release_map" causes
"preempt_disable()" to be called and "preempt_enable()" isn't called
until "qxl_release_unmap" is used. Move the call to "qxl_bo_unref" out
from in between the two to avoid sleeping from an atomic context.

This issue can be demonstrated on a kernel with CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y by
creating a VM using QXL, using a desktop environment using Xorg, then
moving the cursor on or off a window.
