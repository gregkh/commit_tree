lib/idr.c: remove simple_ida_lock

Improve the scalability of the IDA by using the per-IDA xa_lock rather
than the global simple_ida_lock.  IDAs are not typically used in
performance-sensitive locations, but since we have this lock anyway, we
can use it.  It is also a step towards converting the IDA from the radix
tree to the XArray.
