Mytek manufactures some equipment with DICE-based firewire ports. These
devices contain old versions of DICE firmware which lacks detailed
stream format reporting for all sampling clock modes.

Building upon the recent work by Takashi Sakamoto, hard-coded parameters
are added for the Stereo 192 DSD-DAC. When the device vendor and model
match the coded parameters are copied into the stream format cache.
