nvme/pci: Sync controller reset for AER slot_reset

AER handling expects a successful return from slot_reset means the
driver made the device functional again. The nvme driver had been using
an asynchronous reset to recover the device, so the device
may still be initializing after control is returned to the
AER handler. This creates problems for subsequent event handling,
causing the initializion to fail.

This patch fixes that by syncing the controller reset before returning
to the AER driver, and reporting the true state of the reset.
