drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Don't use fast link training when panel just powered up

Panel would reset its setting when it powers down. It would forget the last
succeeded link training setting. So we can't use the last successful link
training setting to do fast link training. Let's reset fast_train_enable in
analogix_dp_bridge_disable();
