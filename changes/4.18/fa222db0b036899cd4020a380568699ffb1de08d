scsi: hisi_sas: Don't lock DQ for complete task sending

Currently we lock the DQ to protect whole delivery process.  So this
stops us building slots for the same queue in parallel, and can affect
performance.

To optimise it, only lock the DQ during special periods, specifically
when allocating a slot from the DQ and when delivering a slot to the HW.

This approach is now safe, thanks to the previous patches to ensure that
we always deliver a slot to the HW once allocated.
