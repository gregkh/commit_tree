net: hns3: Fix for netdev not running problem after calling net_stop and net_open

The link status update function is called by timer every second. But
net_stop and net_open may be called with very short intervals. The link
status update function can not detect the link state has changed. It
causes the netdev not running problem.

This patch fixes it by updating the link state in ae_stop function.
