scsi: ufs: make sure all interrupts are processed

As multiple requests are submitted to the ufs host controller in
parallel there could be instances where the command completion interrupt
arrives later for a request that is already processed earlier as the
corresponding doorbell was cleared when handling the previous
interrupt. Read the interrupt status in a loop after processing the
received interrupt to catch such interrupts and handle it.
