KVM: arm/arm64: Set dist->spis to NULL after kfree

in case kvm_vgic_map_resources() fails, typically if the vgic
distributor is not defined, __kvm_vgic_destroy will be called
several times. Indeed kvm_vgic_map_resources() is called on
first vcpu run. As a result dist->spis is freeed more than once
and on the second time it causes a "kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:3912!"

Set dist->spis to NULL to avoid the crash.

vgic_init")
