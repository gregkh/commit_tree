arm64: Unify kernel fault reporting

In do_page_fault(), we handle some kernel faults early, and simply
die() with a message. For faults handled later, we dump the faulting
address, decode the ESR, walk the page tables, and perform a number of
steps to ensure that this data is reported.

Let's unify the handling of fatal kernel faults with a new
die_kernel_fault() helper, handling all of these details. This is
largely the same as the existing logic in __do_kernel_fault(), except
that addresses are consistently padded to 16 hex characters, as would be
expected for a 64-bit address.

The messages currently logged in do_page_fault are adjusted to fit into
the die_kernel_fault() message template.
