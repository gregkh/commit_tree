clk: qcom: Register the gdscs before the clocks

We have atleast some instances of ALWAYS_ON gdscs, which need to
be turned ON *before* some clocks within the gdsc domain marked
with a CLK_IS_CRITICAL can be turned ON.
To facilitate this sequence, register the GDCSs (and hence handle
the ALWAYS_ON gdscs) before we register clocks (and handle the
clocks marked as CLK_IS_CRITICAL)
