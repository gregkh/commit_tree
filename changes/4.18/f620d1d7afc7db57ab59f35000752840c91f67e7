media: uvcvideo: Support UVC 1.5 video probe & commit controls

The length of UVC 1.5 video control is 48, and it is 34 for UVC 1.1.
Change it to 48 for UVC 1.5 device, and the UVC 1.5 device can be
recognized.

More changes to the driver are needed for full UVC 1.5 compatibility.
However, at least the UVC 1.5 Realtek RTS5847/RTS5852 cameras have been
reported to work well.
