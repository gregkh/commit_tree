firmware: add firmware_request_nowarn() - load firmware without warnings

Currently the firmware loader only exposes one silent path for querying
optional firmware, and that is firmware_request_direct(). This function
also disables the sysfs fallback mechanism, which might not always be the
desired behaviour [0].

This patch introduces a variations of request_firmware() that enable the
caller to disable the undesired warning messages but enables the sysfs
fallback mechanism. This is equivalent to adding FW_OPT_NO_WARN to the
old behaviour.
