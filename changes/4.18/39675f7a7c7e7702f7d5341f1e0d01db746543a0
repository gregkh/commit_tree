ALSA: rawmidi: Change resized buffers atomically

The SNDRV_RAWMIDI_IOCTL_PARAMS ioctl may resize the buffers and the
current code is racy.  For example, the sequencer client may write to
buffer while it being resized.

As a simple workaround, let's switch to the resized buffer inside the
stream runtime lock.
