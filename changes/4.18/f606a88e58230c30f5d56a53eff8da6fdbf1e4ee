crypto: aegis - Add generic AEGIS AEAD implementations

This patch adds the generic implementation of the AEGIS family of AEAD
algorithms (AEGIS-128, AEGIS-128L, and AEGIS-256). The original
authors of AEGIS are Hongjun Wu and Bart Preneel.

At the time of writing, AEGIS is one of the finalists in CAESAR, an
open competition intended to select a portfolio of alternatives to
the problematic AES-GCM:
