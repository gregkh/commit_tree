hwrng: core - Always drop the RNG in hwrng_unregister()

enable_best_rng() is used in hwrng_unregister() to switch away from the
currently active RNG, if that is the one currently being removed.
However enable_best_rng() might fail, if the next RNG's init routine
fails. In that case enable_best_rng() will return an error code and
the currently active RNG will remain active.
After unregistering this might lead to crashes due to use-after-free.

Fix this by dropping the currently active RNG, if enable_best_rng()
failed. This will result in no RNG to be active, if the next-best
one failed to initialize.
