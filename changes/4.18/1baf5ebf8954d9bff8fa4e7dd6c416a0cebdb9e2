erspan: auto detect truncated packets.

Currently the truncated bit is set only when the mirrored packet
is larger than mtu.  For certain cases, the packet might already
been truncated before sending to the erspan tunnel.  In this case,
the patch detect whether the IP header's total length is larger
than the actual skb->len.  If true, this indicated that the
mirrored packet is truncated and set the erspan truncate bit.

I tested the patch using bpf_skb_change_tail helper function to
shrink the packet size and send to erspan tunnel.
