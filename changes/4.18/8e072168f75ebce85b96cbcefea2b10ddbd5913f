brcmfmac: add support for sysfs initiated coredump

The driver already supports device coredump initiated by firmware
event. Since commit 3c47d19ff4dc ("drivers: base: add coredump driver
ops") it is also possible to initiate it from user-space through
sysfs. This patch adds support for SDIO and PCIe devices.
