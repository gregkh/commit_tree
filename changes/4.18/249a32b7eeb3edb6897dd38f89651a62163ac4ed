usb: core: handle hub C_PORT_OVER_CURRENT condition

Based on USB2.0 Spec Section 11.12.5,

  "If a hub has per-port power switching and per-port current limiting,
  an over-current on one port may still cause the power on another port
  to fall below specific minimums. In this case, the affected port is
  placed in the Power-Off state and C_PORT_OVER_CURRENT is set for the
  port, but PORT_OVER_CURRENT is not set."

so let's check C_PORT_OVER_CURRENT too for over current condition.
