drm/i915/gvt: Update time slice more frequently

When there is only one vGPU in GVT-g and it submits workloads
continuously, it will not be scheduled out, vgpu_update_timeslice
is not called and its sched_in_time is not updated in a long time,
which can be several seconds or longer.
Once GVT-g pauses to submit workload for this vGPU due to heavy
host CPU workload, this vGPU get scheduled out and
vgpu_update_timeslice is called, its left_ts will be subtract
by a big value from sched_out_time - sched_in_time.
When GVT-g is going to submit workload for this vGPU again,
it will not be scheduled in until gvt_balance_timeslice reaches
stage 0 and reset its left_ts, which introduces several
hunderand milliseconds latency.

This patch updates time slice in every ms to update sched_in_time
timely.

v2: revise commit message
v3: use more concise expr. (Zhenyu)
