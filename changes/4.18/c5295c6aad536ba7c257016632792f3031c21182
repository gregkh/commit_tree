xfs: fix double ijoin in xfs_reflink_cancel_cow_range

xfs_reflink_cancel_cow_range joins an inode twice to the same
transaction.  This is not allowed, so fix it and document that the
callers of xfs_reflink_cancel_cow_blocks() must have already joined the
inode to the permanent transaction passed in.
