autofs: remove left-over autofs4 stubs

There's no need to retain the fs/autofs4 directory for backward
compatibility.

Adding an AUTOFS4_FS fragment to the autofs Kconfig and a module alias
for autofs4 is sufficient for almost all cases. Not keeping fs/autofs4
remnants will prevent "insmod <path>/autofs4/autofs4.ko" from working
but this shouldn't be used in automation scripts rather than
modprobe(8).

There were some comments about things to look out for with the module
rename in the fs/autofs4/Kconfig that is removed by this patch, see the
commit patch if you are interested.

One potential problem with this change is that when the
fs/autofs/Kconfig fragment for AUTOFS4_FS is removed any AUTOFS4_FS
entries will be removed from the kernel config, resulting in no autofs
file system being built if there is no AUTOFS_FS entry also.

This would have also happened if the fs/autofs4 remnants had remained
and is most likely to be a problem with automated builds.

Please check your build configurations before the removal which will
occur after the next couple of kernel releases.
