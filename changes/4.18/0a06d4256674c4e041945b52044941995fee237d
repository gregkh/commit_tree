KVM: vmx: use local variable for current_vmptr when emulating VMPTRST

Do not expose the address of vmx->nested.current_vmptr to
kvm_write_guest_virt_system() as the resulting __copy_to_user()
call will trigger a WARN when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is
enabled.

Opportunistically clean up variable names in handle_vmptrst()
to improve readability, e.g. vmcs_gva is misleading as the
memory operand of VMPTRST is plain memory, not a VMCS.
