ARM: dts: exynos: Update x and y properties for mms114 touchscreen

The mms114 binding [1] specifies that the 'x' and 'y' should be
called respectively 'touchscreen-size-x' and 'touchscreen-size-y'
in coherence with the touchscreen [2] binding.

Update the mms114 node for trats2 and trats dts according to the
binding.
