fs/9p: detect invalid options as much as possible

Currently when detecting invalid options in option parsing, some
options(e.g.  msize) just set errno and allow to continuously validate
other options so that it can detect invalid options as much as possible
and give proper error messages together.

This patch applies same rule to option 'cache' and 'access' when
detecting -EINVAL.
