multicast: do not restore deleted record source filter mode to new one

There are two scenarios that we will restore deleted records. The first is
when device down and up(or unmap/remap). In this scenario the new filter
mode is same with previous one. Because we get it from in_dev->mc_list and
we do not touch it during device down and up.

The other scenario is when a new socket join a group which was just delete
and not finish sending status reports. In this scenario, we should use the
current filter mode instead of restore old one. Here are 4 cases in total.

old_socket        new_socket       before_fix       after_fix
  IN(A)             IN(A)           ALLOW(A)         ALLOW(A)
  IN(A)             EX( )           TO_IN( )         TO_EX( )
  EX( )             IN(A)           TO_EX( )         ALLOW(A)
  EX( )             EX( )           TO_EX( )         TO_EX( )
