x86: fix dependency of X86_32_LAZY_GS

Commit 2a61f4747eea ("stack-protector: test compiler capability in
Kconfig and drop AUTO mode") replaced the 'choice' with two boolean
symbols, so CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE no longer exists.

Prior to commit 2bc2f688fdf8 ("Makefile: move stack-protector
availability out of Kconfig"), this line was like this:

  depends on X86_32 && !CC_STACKPROTECTOR

The CC_ prefix was dropped by commit 050e9baa9dc9 ("Kbuild: rename
CC_STACKPROTECTOR[_STRONG] config variables"), so the dependency now
should be:

  depends on X86_32 && !STACKPROTECTOR
