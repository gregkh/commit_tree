nvme-rdma: fix possible double free condition when failing to create a controller

Failures after nvme_init_ctrl will defer resource cleanups to .free_ctrl
when the reference is released, hence we should not free the controller
queues for these failures.

Fix that by moving controller queues allocation before controller
initialization and correctly freeing them for failures before
initialization and skip them for failures after initialization.
