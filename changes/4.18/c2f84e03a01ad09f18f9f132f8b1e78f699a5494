drm/amd/display: Don't program bypass on linear regamma LUT

Even though this is required for degamma since DCE HW only supports a
couple predefined LUTs we can just program the LUT directly for regamma.

This fixes dark screens which occurs when we program regamma to bypass
while degamma is using srgb LUT.
