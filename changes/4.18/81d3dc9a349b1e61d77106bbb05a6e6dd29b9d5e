locking/qspinlock: Add stat tracking for pending vs. slowpath

Currently, the qspinlock_stat code tracks only statistical counts in the
PV qspinlock code. However, it may also be useful to track the number
of locking operations done via the pending code vs. the MCS lock queue
slowpath for the non-PV case.

The qspinlock stat code is modified to do that. The stat counter
pv_lock_slowpath is renamed to lock_slowpath so that it can be used by
both the PV and non-PV cases.
