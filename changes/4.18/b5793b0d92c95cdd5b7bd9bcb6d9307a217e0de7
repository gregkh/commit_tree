posix-timers: Make compat syscalls depend on CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME

clock_gettime, clock_settime, clock_getres and clock_nanosleep
compat syscalls are also repurposed to provide backward compatibility
to support 32 bit time_t on 32 bit systems.

Note that nanosleep compat syscall will also be treated the same way
as the above syscalls as it shares common handler functions with
clock_nanosleep. But, there is no plan to provide y2038 safe solution
for nanosleep.
