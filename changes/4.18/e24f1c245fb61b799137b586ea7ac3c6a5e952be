block, bfq: remove slow-system class

BFQ computes the duration of weight raising for interactive
applications automatically, using some reference parameters. In
particular, BFQ uses the best durations (see comments in the code for
how these durations have been assessed) for two classes of systems:
slow and fast ones. Examples of slow systems are old phones or systems
using micro HDDs. Fast systems are all the remaining ones. Using these
parameters, BFQ computes the actual duration of the weight raising,
for the system at hand, as a function of the relative speed of the
system w.r.t. the speed of a reference system, belonging to the same
class of systems as the system at hand.

This slow vs fast differentiation proved to be useful in the past, but
happens to have little meaning with current hardware. Even worse, it
does cause problems in virtual systems, where the speed of the system
can vary frequently, and so widely to just confuse the class-detection
mechanism, and, as we have verified experimentally, to cause BFQ to
compute non-sensical weight-raising durations.

This commit addresses this issue by removing the slow class and the
class-detection mechanism.
