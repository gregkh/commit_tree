netfilter: nf_tables: move dumper state allocation into ->start

Shaochun Chen points out we leak dumper filter state allocations
stored in dump_control->data in case there is an error before netlink sets
cb_running (after which ->done will be called at some point).

In order to fix this, add .start functions and do the allocations
there.

->done is going to clean up, and in case error occurs before
->start invocation no cleanups need to be done anymore.
