signal/alpha: Document a conflict with SI_USER for SIGFPE

Setting si_code to 0 is the same as setting si_code to SI_USER.  This
is the same si_code as SI_USER.  Posix and common sense requires that
SI_USER not be a signal specific si_code.  As such this use of 0 for
the si_code is a pretty horribly broken ABI.
