Fix printk format warning in arch/arc/plat-eznps/mtm.c:

The hs_ctr variable can just be int instead of long, so also change
kstrtol() to kstrtoint() and leave the format string as %d.

Also add 2 header files since they are used in mtm.c and we prefer
not to depend on accidental/indirect #includes.
