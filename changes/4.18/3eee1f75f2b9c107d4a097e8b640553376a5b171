bpf: fix bpf_skb_load_bytes_relative pkt length check

The len > skb_headlen(skb) cannot be used as a maximum upper bound
for the packet length since it does not have any relation to the full
linear packet length when filtering is used from upper layers (e.g.
in case of reuseport BPF programs) as by then skb->data, skb->len
already got mangled through __skb_pull() and others.
