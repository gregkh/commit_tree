drm/i915: Stop tracking timeline->inflight_seqnos

In commit 9b6586ae9f6b ("drm/i915: Keep a global seqno per-engine"), we
moved from a global inflight counter to per-engine counters in the
hope that will be easy to run concurrently in future. However, with the
advent of the desire to move requests between engines, we do need a
global counter to preserve the semantics that no engine wraps in the
middle of a submit. (Although this semantic is now only required for gen7
semaphore support, which only supports greater-then comparisons!)

v2: Keep a global counter of all requests ever submitted and force the
reset when it wraps.
