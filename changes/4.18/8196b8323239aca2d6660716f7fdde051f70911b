media: staging: atomisp: reenable warnings for I2C

When atomisp got merged, there were so many warnings with W=1
that we simply disabled the ones that were causing troubles.

Since then, several changes got applied to atomisp, and the
number of warnings are a way smaller than it used to be.

So, let's reenable warnings there and fix the issues.
