drm/pl111: Support the Versatile Express

The Versatile Express uses a special configuration controller
deeply embedded in the system motherboard FPGA to multiplex the
two to three (!) display controller instances out to the single
SiI9022 bridge.

Set up an extra file with the logic to probe to the FPGA mux
register on the system controller bus, then parse the device
tree to see if there is a CLCD or HDLCD instance on the core
tile (also known as the daughterboard) by looking in the
root of the device tree for compatible nodes.

- If there is a HDLCD on the core tile, and there is a driver
  for it, we exit probe and deactivate the motherboard CLCD.
  We do not touch the DVI mux in this case, to make sure we
  don't break HDLCD.

- If there is a CLCD on both the motherboard and the core tile
  (only the CA9 has this) the core tile CLCD takes precedence
  and get muxed to the DVI connector.

- Only if there is no working graphics on the core tile, the
  motherboard CLCD is probed and muxed to the DVI connector.

Core tile graphics should always take precedence as it can
address all memory and is also faster, however the motherboard
CLCD is good to have around for diagnostics and testing.

It is possible to test the motherboard CLCD by setting the
status = "disabled" property on the core tile CLCD or
HDLCD.

Scale down the Versatile Express to 16BPP so we can support a
1024x768 display despite the bus bandwidth restrictions on this
platform. (The motherboard CLCD supports slightly lower
resolution.)
