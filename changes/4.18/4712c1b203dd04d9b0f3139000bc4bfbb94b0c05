bpf, doc: add basic README.rst file

A README.rst file in a directory have special meaning for sites like
github, which auto renders the contents.  Plus search engines like
Google also index these README.rst files.

Auto rendering allow us to use links, for (re)directing eBPF users to
other places where docs live.  The end-goal would be to direct users
towards https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest but we haven't written
the full docs yet, so we start out small and take this incrementally.

This directory itself contains some useful docs, which can be linked
to from the README.rst file (verified this works for github).
