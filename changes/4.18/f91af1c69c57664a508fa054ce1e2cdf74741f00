LICENSES: Add Linux-OpenIB license text

The infiniband code uses a variant of the OpenIB license. This license is
BSD-2-Clause with the MIT disclaimer. The linux kernel uses this license
extensively throughout the driver subsystem since 2005. Note that the
OpenIB.org license is a true match to BSD-2-Clause.
