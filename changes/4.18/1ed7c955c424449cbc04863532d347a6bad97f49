ARM: dts: imx7: Fix error in coresight TPIU graph connection

OF graph endpoint connections must be bidirectional and dtc will now
warn if they are not. i.MX7 based DTs have an error and generate
warnings:

Warning (graph_endpoint): /replicator/ports/port@0/endpoint: graph connection to node '/soc/tpiu@30087000/port/endpoint' is not bidirectional
Warning (graph_endpoint): /soc/tpiu@30087000/port/endpoint: graph connection to node '/replicator/ports/port@1/endpoint' is not bidirectional

This appears to be a copy-n-paste error and the TPIU input should be
connected to replicator port 0 instead of port 1.
