ext4: fix inline data updates with checksums enabled

The inline data code was updating the raw inode directly; this is
problematic since if metadata checksums are enabled,
ext4_mark_inode_dirty() must be called to update the inode's checksum.
In addition, the jbd2 layer requires that get_write_access() be called
before the metadata buffer is modified.  Fix both of these problems.
