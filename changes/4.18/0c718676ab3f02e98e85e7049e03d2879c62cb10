typec: tcpm: fix compiler warning about stupid things

gcc thinks it is too smart and gives off a "you might be using this
variable before it is initialized" warning in tcpm_pd_build_request(),
because it can not follow the logic through the tcpm_pd_select_pdo()
call.

So just make gcc quiet by initializing things to 0, to prevent the
myriad of people complaining that we now have a build warning.
