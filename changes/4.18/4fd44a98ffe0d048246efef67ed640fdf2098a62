tcp: verify the checksum of the first data segment in a new connection

commit 079096f103fa ("tcp/dccp: install syn_recv requests into ehash
table") introduced an optimization for the handling of child sockets
created for a new TCP connection.

But this optimization passes any data associated with the last ACK of the
connection handshake up the stack without verifying its checksum, because it
calls tcp_child_process(), which in turn calls tcp_rcv_state_process()
directly.  These lower-level processing functions do not do any checksum
verification.

Insert a tcp_checksum_complete call in the TCP_NEW_SYN_RECEIVE path to
fix this.
