sparc: fix compat siginfo ABI regression

Starting with commit v4.14-rc1~60^2^2~1, a SIGFPE signal sent via kill
results to wrong values in si_pid and si_uid fields of compat siginfo_t.

This happens due to FPE_FIXME being defined to 0 for sparc, and at the
same time siginfo_layout() introduced by the same commit returns
SIL_FAULT for SIGFPE if si_code == SI_USER and FPE_FIXME is defined to 0.

Fix this regression by removing FPE_FIXME macro and changing all its users
to assign FPE_FLTUNK to si_code instead of FPE_FIXME.

Note that FPE_FLTUNK is a new macro introduced by commit
266da65e9156d93e1126e185259a4aae68188d0e.

Tested with commit v4.16-11958-g16e205cf42da.

This bug was found by strace test suite.
