block: use ktime_get_ns() instead of sched_clock() for cfq and bfq

cfq and bfq have some internal fields that use sched_clock() which can
trivially use ktime_get_ns() instead. Their timestamp fields in struct
request can also use ktime_get_ns(), which resolves the 8 year old
comment added by commit 28f4197e5d47 ("block: disable preemption before
using sched_clock()").
