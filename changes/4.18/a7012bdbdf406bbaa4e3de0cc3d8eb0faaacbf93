x86/xen/efi: Initialize UEFI secure boot state during dom0 boot

Initialize UEFI secure boot state during dom0 boot. Otherwise the kernel
may not even know that it runs on secure boot enabled platform.

Note that part of drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/secureboot.c is duplicated
by this patch, only in this case, it runs in the context of the kernel
proper rather than UEFI boot context. The reason for the duplication is
that maintaining the original code to run correctly on ARM/arm64 as well
as on all the quirky x86 firmware we support is enough of a burden as it
is, and adding the x86/Xen execution context to that mix just so we can
reuse a single routine just isn't worth it.
