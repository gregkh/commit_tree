x86/efi: Access EFI MMIO data as unencrypted when SEV is active

SEV guest fails to update the UEFI runtime variables stored in the
flash.

The following commit:

  1379edd59673 ("x86/efi: Access EFI data as encrypted when SEV is active")

unconditionally maps all the UEFI runtime data as 'encrypted' (C=1).

When SEV is active the UEFI runtime data marked as EFI_MEMORY_MAPPED_IO
should be mapped as 'unencrypted' so that both guest and hypervisor can
access the data.
