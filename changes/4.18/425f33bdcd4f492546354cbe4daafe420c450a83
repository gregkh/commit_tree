dt-bindings: display: renesas: Add R-Car M3-N HDMI TX DT bindings

The M3-N HDMI TX controller is compatible with the M3-W and H3. No
extension to the DT bindings are needed.

Add an SoC-specific compatible string in case differences between the IP
versions are found later and require model-specific handling.
