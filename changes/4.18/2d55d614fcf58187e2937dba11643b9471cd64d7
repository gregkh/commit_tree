net: xsk: don't return frames via the allocator on error

xdp_return_buff() is used when frame has been successfully
handled (transmitted) or if an error occurred during delayed
processing and there is no way to report it back to
xdp_do_redirect().

In case of __xsk_rcv_zc() error is propagated all the way
back to the driver, so there is no need to call
xdp_return_buff().  Driver will recycle the frame anyway
after seeing that error happened.
