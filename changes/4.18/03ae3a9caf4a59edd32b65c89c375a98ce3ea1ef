Input: psmouse - fix button reporting for basic protocols

The commit ba667650c568 ("Input: psmouse - clean up code") was pretty
brain-dead and broke extra buttons reporting for variety of PS/2 mice:
Genius, Thinkmouse and Intellimouse Explorer. We need to actually inspect
the data coming from the device when reporting events.
