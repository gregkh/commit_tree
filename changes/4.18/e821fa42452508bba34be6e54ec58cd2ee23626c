signal/powerpc: Replace TRAP_FIXME with TRAP_UNK

Using an si_code of 0 that aliases with SI_USER is clearly the wrong
thing todo, and causes problems in interesting ways.

For use in unknown_exception the recently defined TRAP_UNK
semantically is a perfect fit.  For use in RunModeException it looks
like something more specific than TRAP_UNK could be used.  No one has
bothered to find a better fit than the broken si_code of 0 in all of
these years and I don't see an obvious better fit so TRAP_UNK is
switching RunModeException to return TRAP_UNK is clearly an
improvement.

Recent history suggests no actually cares about crazy corner
cases of the kernel behavior like this so I don't expect any
regressions from changing this.  However if something does
happen this change is easy to revert.

Though I wonder if SIGKILL might not be a better fit.
