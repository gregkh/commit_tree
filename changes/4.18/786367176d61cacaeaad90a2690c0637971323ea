reset: uniphier: add SATA reset control support and change SATA-PHY ID

Add reset lines for SATA controller on UniPhier SoCs.
This adds support for Pro4 and PXs3 in addition to PXs2.

And this changes the ID of the reset line for SATA-PHY on PXs2.
Since some SoCs have two controller instances with a common PHY, this moves
the ID of SATA-PHY for consistency.
