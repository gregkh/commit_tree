svcrdma: Introduce svc_rdma_recv_ctxt

svc_rdma_op_ctxt's are pre-allocated and maintained on a per-xprt
free list. This eliminates the overhead of calling kmalloc / kfree,
both of which grab a globally shared lock that disables interrupts.
To reduce contention further, separate the use of these objects in
the Receive and Send paths in svcrdma.

Subsequent patches will take advantage of this separation by
allocating real resources which are then cached in these objects.
The allocations are freed when the transport is torn down.

I've renamed the structure so that static type checking can be used
to ensure that uses of op_ctxt and recv_ctxt are not confused. As an
additional clean up, structure fields are renamed to conform with
kernel coding conventions.

As a final clean up, helpers related to recv_ctxt are moved closer
to the functions that use them.
