sfc: hold filter_sem consistently during reset

We should take and release the filter_sem consistently during the
reset process, in the same manner as the mac_lock and reset_lock.

For lockdep consistency we also take the filter_sem for write around
other calls to efx->type->init().

Fixes: c2bebe37c6b6 ("sfc: give ef10 its own rwsem in the filter table instead of filter_lock")
