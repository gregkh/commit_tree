staging: ks7010: replace uint* type into the u* ones in hostif_bss_scan_request

In function hostif_bss_scan_request parameters 'scan_ssid' and
'scan_ssid_len' are declared as uint8_t. Change them to be 'u8'
instead which is preferred. Also update two casts inside the same
function to use 'u32' instead of 'uint32_t'.
