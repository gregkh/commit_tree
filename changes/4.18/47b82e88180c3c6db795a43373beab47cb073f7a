ide: don't enable/disable interrupts in force threaded-IRQ mode

The interrupts are enabled/disabled so the interrupt handler can run
with enabled interrupts while serving the interrupt and not lose other
interrupts especially the timer tick.
If the system runs with force-threaded interrupts then there is no need
to enable the interrupts.
