net: sched: don't disable bh when accessing action idr

Initial net_device implementation used ingress_lock spinlock to synchronize
ingress path of device. This lock was used in both process and bh context.
In some code paths action map lock was obtained while holding ingress_lock.
Commit e1e992e52faa ("[NET_SCHED] protect action config/dump from irqs")
modified actions to always disable bh, while using action map lock, in
order to prevent deadlock on ingress_lock in softirq. This lock was removed
from net_device, so disabling bh, while accessing action map, is no longer
necessary.

Replace all action idr spinlock usage with regular calls that do not
disable bh.
