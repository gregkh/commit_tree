tools/memory-model: Redefine rb in terms of rcu-fence

This patch reorganizes the definition of rb in the Linux Kernel Memory
Consistency Model.  The relation is now expressed in terms of
rcu-fence, which consists of a sequence of gp and rscs links separated
by rcu-link links, in which the number of occurrences of gp is >= the
number of occurrences of rscs.

Arguments similar to those published in
http://diy.inria.fr/linux/long.pdf show that rcu-fence behaves like an
inter-CPU strong fence.  Furthermore, the definition of rb in terms of
rcu-fence is highly analogous to the definition of pb in terms of
strong-fence, which can help explain why rcu-path expresses a form of
temporal ordering.

This change should not affect the semantics of the memory model, just
its internal organization.
