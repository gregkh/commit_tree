block: always set partition number to '0' in blk_partition_remap()

blk_partition_remap() will only clear bi_partno if an actual remapping
has happened. But flush request et al don't have an actual size, so
the remapping doesn't happen and bi_partno is never cleared.
So for stacked devices blk_partition_remap() will be called on each level.
If (as is the case for native nvme multipathing) one of the lower-level
devices do _not_support partitioning a spurious I/O error is generated.
