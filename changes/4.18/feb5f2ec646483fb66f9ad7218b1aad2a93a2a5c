tcp: export packets delivery info

Export data delivered and delivered with CE marks to
1) SNMP TCPDelivered and TCPDeliveredCE
2) getsockopt(TCP_INFO)
3) Timestamping API SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS

Note that for SCM_TSTAMP_ACK, the delivery info in
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS is reported before the info
was fully updated on the ACK.

These stats help application monitor TCP delivery and ECN status
on per host, per connection, even per message level.
