KVM: arm64: Save host SVE context as appropriate

This patch adds SVE context saving to the hyp FPSIMD context switch
path.  This means that it is no longer necessary to save the host
SVE state in advance of entering the guest, when in use.

In order to avoid adding pointless complexity to the code, VHE is
assumed if SVE is in use.  VHE is an architectural prerequisite for
SVE, so there is no good reason to turn CONFIG_ARM64_VHE off in
kernels that support both SVE and KVM.

Historically, software models exist that can expose the
architecturally invalid configuration of SVE without VHE, so if
this situation is detected at kvm_init() time then KVM will be
disabled.
