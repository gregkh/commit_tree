block, bfq: add description of weight-raising heuristics

A description of how weight raising works is missing in BFQ
sources. In addition, the code for handling weight raising is
scattered across a few functions. This makes it rather hard to
understand the mechanism and its rationale. This commits adds such a
description at the beginning of the main source file.
