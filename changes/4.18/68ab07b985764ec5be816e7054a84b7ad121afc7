KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Add guard code to prevent returning to guest with PR=0 and Transactional state

Currently PR KVM doesn't support transaction memory in guest privileged
state.

This patch adds a check at setting guest msr, so that we can never return
to guest with PR=0 and TS=0b10. A tabort will be emulated to indicate
this and fail transaction immediately.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - don't change the TM_CAUSE_MISC definition, instead
 use TM_CAUSE_KVM_FAC_UNAV.]
