scsi: ufs: Extract devfreq registration

Failing to register with devfreq leaves hba->devfreq assigned, which causes
the error path to dereference the ERR_PTR(). Rather than bolting on more
conditionals, move the call of devm_devfreq_add_device() into it's own
function and only update hba->devfreq once it's successfully registered.

The subsequent patch builds upon this to make UFS actually work again, as
it's been broken since f1d981eaecf8 ("PM / devfreq: Use the available
min/max frequency")

Also switch to use DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND constant.
