Revert "mfd: cros_ec: Add ACPI GPE handler for LID0 devices"

This reverts commit e04653a9dcf4d98defe2149c885382e5cc72082f.

It is no longer needed to install Chrome EC GPE handler to have
GPE enabled in suspend to idle path. It is found that with this
handler installed, EC wake up doesn't work because default EC
event handler that can wake up system is not getting called.
