locking/lockdep: Do not record IRQ state within lockdep code

While debugging where things were going wrong with mapping
enabling/disabling interrupts with the lockdep state and actual real
enabling and disabling interrupts, I had to silent the IRQ
disabling/enabling in debug_check_no_locks_freed() because it was
always showing up as it was called before the splat was.

Use raw_local_irq_save/restore() for not only debug_check_no_locks_freed()
but for all internal lockdep functions, as they hide useful information
about where interrupts were used incorrectly last.
