video: fbdev: aty: aty128fb: Replace mdelay with msleep in aty128_set_suspend

aty128_set_suspend() is never called in atomic context.

The call chains ending up at aty128_set_suspend() are:
[1] aty128_set_suspend() <- aty128_pci_suspend()
[2] aty128_set_suspend() <- aty128_do_resume() <- aty128_pci_resume()
[3] aty128_set_suspend() <- aty128_do_resume() <- aty128_early_resume()

aty128_pci_suspend() is set as ".suspend" in struct pci_driver.
aty128_pci_resume() is set as ".resume" in struct pci_driver.
aty128_early_resume() is never called.
These functions are not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, aty128_set_suspend()
calls mdelay() to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with msleep() to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
