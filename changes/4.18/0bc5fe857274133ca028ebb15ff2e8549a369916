qed*: Refactor mf_mode to consist of bits.

`mf_mode' field indicates the multi-partitioning mode the device is
configured to. This method doesn't scale very well, adding a new MF mode
requires going over all the existing conditions, and deciding whether those
are needed for the new mode or not.
The patch defines a set of bit-fields for modes which are derived according
to the mode info shared by the MFW and all the configuration would be made
according to those. To add a new mode, there would be a single place where
we'll need to go and choose which bits apply and which don't.
