smb3: allow "posix" mount option to enable new SMB311 protocol extensions

If "posix" (or synonym "unix" for backward compatibility) specified on mount,
and server advertises support for SMB3.11 POSIX negotiate context, then
enable the new posix extensions on the tcon.  This can be viewed by
looking for "posix" in the mount options displayed by /proc/mounts
for that mount (ie if posix extensions allowed by server and the
experimental POSIX extensions also requested on the mount by specifying
"posix" at mount time).

Also add check to warn user if conflicting unix/nounix or posix/noposix specified
on mount.
