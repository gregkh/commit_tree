powerpc: rtas: clean up time handling

The to_tm() helper function operates on a signed integer for the time,
so it will suffer from overflow in 2038, even on 64-bit kernels.

Rather than fix that function, this replaces its use in the rtas
procfs implementation with the standard rtc_time64_to_tm() helper
that is very similar but is not affected by the overflow.

In order to actually support long times, the parser function gets
changed to 64-bit user input and output as well. Note that the tm_mon
and tm_year representation is slightly different, so we have to manually
add an offset here.
