scsi: reduce use of block bounce buffers

We can rely on the dma-mapping code to handle any DMA limits that is
bigger than the ISA DMA mask for us (either using an iommu or swiotlb),
so remove setting the block layer bounce limit for anything but the
unchecked_isa_dma case, or the bouncing for highmem pages.
