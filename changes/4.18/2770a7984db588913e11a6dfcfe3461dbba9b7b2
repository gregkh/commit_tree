ibmvnic: Introduce hard reset recovery

Introduce a recovery hard reset to handle reset failure as a result of
change of device context following a transport event, such as a
backing device failover or partition migration. These operations reset
the device context to its initial state. If this occurs during a reset,
any initialization commands are likely to fail with an invalid state
error as backing device firmware requests reinitialization.

When this happens, make one more attempt by performing a hard reset,
which frees any resources currently allocated and performs device
initialization. If a transport event occurs during a device reset, a
flag is set which will trigger a new hard reset following the
completionof the current reset event.
