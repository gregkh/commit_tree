bpf: fix xdp_generic for bpf_adjust_tail usecase

When bpf_adjust_tail was introduced for generic xdp, it changed skb's tail
pointer, so it was pointing to the new "end of the packet". However skb's
len field wasn't properly modified, so on the wire ethernet frame had
original (or even bigger, if adjust_head was used) size. This diff is
fixing this.
