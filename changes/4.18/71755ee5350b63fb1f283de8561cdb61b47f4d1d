squashfs: more metadata hardening

The squashfs fragment reading code doesn't actually verify that the
fragment is inside the fragment table.  The end result _is_ verified to
be inside the image when actually reading the fragment data, but before
that is done, we may end up taking a page fault because the fragment
table itself might not even exist.

Another report from Anatoly and his endless squashfs image fuzzing.
