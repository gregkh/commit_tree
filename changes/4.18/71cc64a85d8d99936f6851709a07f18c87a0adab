powerpc: use task_pid_nr() for TID allocation

The current implementation of TID allocation, using a global IDR, may
result in an errant process starving the system of available TIDs.
Instead, use task_pid_nr(), as mentioned by the original author. The
scenario described which prevented it's use is not applicable, as
set_thread_tidr can only be called after the task struct has been
populated.

In the unlikely event that 2 threads share the TID and are waiting,
all potential outcomes have been determined safe.
