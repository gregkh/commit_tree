qed: Add support for Unified Fabric Port.

This patch adds driver changes for supporting the Unified Fabric Port
(UFP). This is a new paritioning mode wherein MFW provides the set of
parameters to be used by the device such as traffic class, outer-vlan
tag value, priority type etc. Drivers receives this info via notifications
from mfw and configures the hardware accordingly.
