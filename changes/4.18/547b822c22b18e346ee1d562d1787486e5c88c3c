documentation: fpga: move fpga-mgr.txt to driver-api

Move Documentation/fpga/fpga-mgr.txt to driver-api/fpga/fpga-mgr.rst
and:
 - Add to driver-api/fpga/index.rst
 - Format changes so documentation builds cleanly.
 - Minor rewrites that make the doc flow better as ReST documentation.
   - Such as moving API reference to end of doc
 - Change API reference section to refer to kernel-doc documentation in
   fpga-mgr.c driver code rather than statically defining each function.
