bpf: offload: allow offloaded programs to use perf event arrays

BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY is special as far as offload goes.
The map only holds glue to perf ring, not actual data.  Allow
non-offloaded perf event arrays to be used in offloaded programs.
Offload driver can extract the events from HW and put them in
the map for user space to retrieve.
