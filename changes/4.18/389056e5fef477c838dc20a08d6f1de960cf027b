drm/amdkfd: Add Vega10 topology and device info

* Report 64-bit doorbells as HSA_CAP_DOORBELL_TYPE_2_0 in topology
* Report cache information in topology (duplicates GFXv8 info for now)
* Add device info for Vega10 support in KFD

Raven is not enabled at this time as it needs additional changes in
DQM to work with a single SDMA engine.
