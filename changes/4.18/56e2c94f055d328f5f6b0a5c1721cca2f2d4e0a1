inet: frag: enforce memory limits earlier

We currently check current frags memory usage only when
a new frag queue is created. This allows attackers to first
consume the memory budget (default : 4 MB) creating thousands
of frag queues, then sending tiny skbs to exceed high_thresh
limit by 2 to 3 order of magnitude.

Note that before commit 648700f76b03 ("inet: frags: use rhashtables
for reassembly units"), work queue could be starved under DOS,
getting no cpu cycles.
After commit 648700f76b03, only the per frag queue timer can eventually
remove an incomplete frag queue and its skbs.
