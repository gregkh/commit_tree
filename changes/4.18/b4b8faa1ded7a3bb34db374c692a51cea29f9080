samples/bpf: sample application and documentation for AF_XDP sockets

This is a sample application for AF_XDP sockets. The application
supports three different modes of operation: rxdrop, txonly and l2fwd.

To show-case a simple round-robin load-balancing between a set of
sockets in an xskmap, set the RR_LB compile time define option to 1 in
"xdpsock.h".

v2: The entries variable was calculated twice in {umem,xq}_nb_avail.
