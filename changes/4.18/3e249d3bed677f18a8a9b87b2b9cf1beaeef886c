net: hns3: Fix for the null pointer problem occurring when initializing ae_dev failed

When initializing ae_dev failed during loading hclge.ko, the drvdata will
be set to null. When removing hns3.ko, we get a null ae_dev. It causes the
null pointer problem.

This patch removes pci_set_drvdata from error handle of hclge_init_ae_dev
to fix the bug, since pci_set_drvdata has been called in hns3_remove.
Also, we do not need to uninit the ae_dev which is not initialized. And
it may be the one which is initialized failed.
