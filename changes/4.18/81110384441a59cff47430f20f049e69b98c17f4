bpf: sockmap, add hash map support

Sockmap is currently backed by an array and enforces keys to be
four bytes. This works well for many use cases and was originally
modeled after devmap which also uses four bytes keys. However,
this has become limiting in larger use cases where a hash would
be more appropriate. For example users may want to use the 5-tuple
of the socket as the lookup key.

To support this add hash support.
