dt-bindings: pwm-backlight: Add PWM delay proprieties.

Hardware needs a delay between setting an initial (non-zero) PWM and
enabling the backlight using GPIO. The post-pwm-on-delay-ms specifies
this delay in milli seconds. Hardware also needs a delay between disabing
the backlight using GPIO and setting PWM value to 0. The pwm-off-delay-ms
is this delay in milli seconds.
