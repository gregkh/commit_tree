perf symbols: Unify symbol maps

Remove the split of symbol tables for data (MAP__VARIABLE) and for
functions (MAP__FUNCTION), its unneeded and there were various places
doing two lookups to find a symbol, so simplify this.

We still will consider only the symbols that matched the filters in
place, i.e. see the (elf_(sec,sym)|symbol_type)__filter() routines in
the patch, just so that we consider only the same symbols as before,
to reduce the possibility of regressions.

All the tests on 50-something build environments, in varios versions
of lots of distros and cross build environments were performed without
build regressions, as usual with all pull requests the other tests were
also performed: 'perf test' and 'make -C tools/perf build-test'.

Also this was done at a great granularity so that regressions can be
bisected more easily.
