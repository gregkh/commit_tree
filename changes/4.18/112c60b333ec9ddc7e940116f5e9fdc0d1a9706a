ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Reset stream to link mapping

By default all the streams are mapped to all links after controller is
reset which causes stream to be broadcast on all the links.

This patch resets the stream-link mapping after controller reset. The
stream is mapped later to the appropriate link as part of stream setup.
