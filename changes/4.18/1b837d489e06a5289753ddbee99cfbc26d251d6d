net: Revoke export for __skb_tx_hash, update it to just be static skb_tx_hash

I am dropping the export of __skb_tx_hash as after my patches nobody is
using it outside of the net/core/dev.c file. In addition I am renaming and
repurposing it to just be a static declaration of skb_tx_hash since that
was the only user for it at this point. By doing this the compiler can
inline it into __netdev_pick_tx as that will improve performance.
