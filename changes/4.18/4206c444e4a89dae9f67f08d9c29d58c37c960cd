staging: lustre: convert obd uuid hash to rhashtable

The rhashtable data type is a perfect fit for the
export uuid hash table, so use that instead of
cfs_hash (which will eventually be removed).

As rhashtable supports lookups and insertions in atomic
context, there is no need to drop a spinlock while
inserting a new entry, which simplifies code quite a bit.

As there are no simple lookups on this hash table (only
insertions which might fail and take a spinlock), there is
no need to use rcu to free the exports.
