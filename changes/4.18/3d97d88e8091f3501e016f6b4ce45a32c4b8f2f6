tcp: minor optimization around tcp_hdr() usage in receive path

This is additional to the
commit ea1627c20c34 ("tcp: minor optimizations around tcp_hdr() usage").
At this point, skb->data is same with tcp_hdr() as tcp header has not
been pulled yet. So use the less expensive one to get the tcp header.

Remove the third parameter of tcp_rcv_established() and put it into
the function body.

Furthermore, the local variables are listed as a reverse christmas tree :)
