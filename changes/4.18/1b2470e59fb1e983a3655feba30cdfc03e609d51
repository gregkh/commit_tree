netfilter: nf_tables: handle chain name lookups via rhltable

If there is a significant amount of chains list search is too slow, so
add an rhlist table for this.

This speeds up ruleset loading: for every new rule we have to check if
the name already exists in current generation.

We need to be able to cope with duplicate chain names in case a transaction
drops the nfnl mutex (for request_module) and the abort of this old
transaction is still pending.

The list is kept -- we need a way to iterate chains even if hash resize is
in progress without missing an entry.
