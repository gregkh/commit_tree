ACPI / LPSS: Avoid PM quirks on suspend and resume from S3

It is reported that commit a192aa923b66a (ACPI / LPSS: Consolidate
runtime PM and system sleep handling) introduced a system suspend
regression on some machines, but the only functional change made by
it was to cause the PM quirks in the LPSS to also be used during
system suspend and resume.  While that should always work for
suspend-to-idle, it turns out to be problematic for S3
(suspend-to-RAM).

To address that issue restore the previous S3 suspend and resume
behavior of the LPSS to avoid applying PM quirks then.
