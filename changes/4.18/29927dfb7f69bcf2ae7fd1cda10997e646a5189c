PCI: hv: Make sure the bus domain is really unique

When Linux runs as a guest VM in Hyper-V and Hyper-V adds the virtual PCI
bus to the guest, Hyper-V always provides unique PCI domain.

commit 4a9b0933bdfc ("PCI: hv: Use device serial number as PCI domain")
overrode unique domain with the serial number of the first device added to
the virtual PCI bus.

The reason for that patch was to have a consistent and short name for the
device, but Hyper-V doesn't provide unique serial numbers. Using non-unique
serial numbers as domain IDs leads to duplicate device addresses, which
causes PCI bus registration to fail.

commit 0c195567a8f6 ("netvsc: transparent VF management") avoids the need
for commit 4a9b0933bdfc ("PCI: hv: Use device serial number as PCI
domain").  When scripts were used to configure VF devices, the name of
the VF needed to be consistent and short, but with commit 0c195567a8f6
("netvsc: transparent VF management") all the setup is done in the kernel,
and we do not need to maintain consistent name.

Revert commit 4a9b0933bdfc ("PCI: hv: Use device serial number as PCI
domain") so we can reliably support multiple devices being assigned to
a guest.

Tag the patch for stable kernels containing commit 0c195567a8f6
("netvsc: transparent VF management").
