scsi: ufs: ufshcd: Remove VLA usage

On the quest to remove all VLAs from the kernel[1] this moves buffers
off the stack. In the second instance, this collapses two separately
allocated buffers into a single buffer, since they are used
consecutively, which saves 256 bytes (QUERY_DESC_MAX_SIZE + 1) of stack
space.
