i40iw: Extend port reuse support for listeners

If two listeners are created with different IP's but
same port, the second rdma_listen fails due to a
duplicate port entry being added from the CQP add
APBVT OP. commit f16dc0aa5ea2 ("i40iw: Add support
for port reuse on active side connections") does not
account for listener side port reuse.

Check for duplicate port before invoking the CQP command
to add APBVT entry and delete the entry only if the port
is not in use. Additionally, consolidate all port-reuse
logic into i40iw_manage_apbvt.
