Revert "staging:r8188eu: Use lib80211 to support TKIP"

Commit b83b8b1881c4 ("staging:r8188eu: Use lib80211 to support TKIP")
is causing 2 problems for me:

1) One boot the wifi on a laptop with a r8188eu wifi device would not
   connect and dmesg contained an oops about scheduling while atomic
   pointing to the tkip code. This went away after reverting the commit.

2) I reverted the revert to try and get the oops from 1. again to be able
   to add it to this commit message. But now the system did connect to the
   wifi only to print a whole bunch of oopses, followed by a hardfreeze a
   few seconds later. Subsequent reboots also all lead to scenario 2. Until
   I reverted the commit again.

Revert the commit fixes both issues making the laptop usable again.
