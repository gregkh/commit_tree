PCI/AER: Work around use-after-free in pcie_do_fatal_recovery()

When an fatal error is received by a non-bridge device, the device is
removed, and pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() deallocates the device
structure.  The freed device structure is used by subsequent code to send
uevents and print messages.

Hold a reference on the device until we're finished using it.  This is not
an ideal fix because pcie_do_fatal_recovery() should not use the device at
all after removing it, but that's too big a project for right now.
