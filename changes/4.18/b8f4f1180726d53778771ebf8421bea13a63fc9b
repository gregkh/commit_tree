arm: dts: sun8i: h3: libretech-all-h3-cc: Move board definition to common dtsi

Since the libretech-all-h3-cc can use either the H2+, H3 or H5, move the
content of the dts file to a common dtsi file to be included by the H3
variant and in a following patch the H5 variant.

By the way, update the SPDX licence tag position.
