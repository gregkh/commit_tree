platform/mellanox: Add new ODM system types to mlx-platform

Add new ODM system types, matched according to DMI_BOARD_NAME. The
supported ODM Ids are: VMOD0001, VMOD0002, VMOD0003, VMOD0004, VMOD0005.
Patch does not introduce new systems, but allows to ODM companies to set
DMI_BOARD_VENDOR and DMI_PRODUCT_NAME on their own. It assumes that ODM
company can't change DMI_BOARD_NAME.
