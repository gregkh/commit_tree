lockdep: fix fs_reclaim annotation

While revisiting my Btrfs swapfile series [1], I introduced a situation
in which reclaim would lock i_rwsem, and even though the swapon() path
clearly made GFP_KERNEL allocations while holding i_rwsem, I got no
complaints from lockdep.  It turns out that the rework of the fs_reclaim
annotation was broken: if the current task has PF_MEMALLOC set, we don't
acquire the dummy fs_reclaim lock, but when reclaiming we always check
this _after_ we've just set the PF_MEMALLOC flag.  In most cases, we can
fix this by moving the fs_reclaim_{acquire,release}() outside of the
memalloc_noreclaim_{save,restore}(), althought kswapd is slightly
different.  After applying this, I got the expected lockdep splats.
