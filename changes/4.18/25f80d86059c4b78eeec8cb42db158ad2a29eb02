mmc: sdhci-omap: Workaround for Errata i834

Errata i834 in AM572x Sitara Processors Silicon Revision 2.0, 1.1
(SPRZ429K July 2014â€“Revised March 2017 [1]) mentions the maximum
obtainable timeout through MMC host controller is 700ms. And for
commands taking longer than 700ms, hardware timeout should be
disabled and software timeout should be used.

The workaround for Errata i834 can be achieved by adding
SDHCI_QUIRK2_DISABLE_HW_TIMEOUT quirk in sdhci-omap.
