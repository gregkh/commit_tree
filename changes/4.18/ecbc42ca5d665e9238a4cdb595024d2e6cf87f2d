virtio_net: Fix incosistent received bytes counter

When received packets are dropped in virtio_net driver, received packets
counter is incremented but bytes counter is not.
As a result, for instance if we drop all packets by XDP, only received
is counted and bytes stays 0, which looks inconsistent.
IMHO received packets/bytes should be counted if packets are produced by
the hypervisor, like what common NICs on physical machines are doing.
So fix the bytes counter.
