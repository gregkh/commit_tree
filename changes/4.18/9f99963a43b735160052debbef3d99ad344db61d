drm/tinydrm/mi0283qt: Always set rotation value

The PiTFT (ili9340) has a hardware reset circuit that resets only
on power-on and not on each reboot through a gpio like the
rpi-display does. As a result, we need to always apply the
rotation value regardless of the display "on/off" state.
Moved the rotation setting code below out_enable:.
