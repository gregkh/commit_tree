mm, memcontrol: move swap charge handling into get_swap_page()

Patch series "mm, memcontrol: Implement memory.swap.events", v2.

This patchset implements memory.swap.events which contains max and fail
events so that userland can monitor and respond to swap running out.

This patch (of 2):

get_swap_page() is always followed by mem_cgroup_try_charge_swap().
This patch moves mem_cgroup_try_charge_swap() into get_swap_page() and
makes get_swap_page() call the function even after swap allocation
failure.

This simplifies the callers and consolidates memcg related logic and
will ease adding swap related memcg events.
