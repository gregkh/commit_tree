ARM: OMAP2+: Make sure LOGICRETSTATE bits are not cleared

We may have LOGICRETSTATE cleared by the bootloader or kexec boot.

Currently this means we will see lost GPIO interrupts at least for
network interfaces such as wlcore and smsc911x if PER hits retention.

Let's fix the issue by making sure LOGICRETSTATE is set. Once we have
GPIOs working with wakeirqs then we should be able to clear it.
