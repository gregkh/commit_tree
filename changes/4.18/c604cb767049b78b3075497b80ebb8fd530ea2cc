KEYS: DNS: fix parsing multiple options

My recent fix for dns_resolver_preparse() printing very long strings was
incomplete, as shown by syzbot which still managed to hit the
WARN_ONCE() in set_precision() by adding a crafted "dns_resolver" key:

    precision 50001 too large
    WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 864 at lib/vsprintf.c:2164 vsnprintf+0x48a/0x5a0

The bug this time isn't just a printing bug, but also a logical error
when multiple options ("#"-separated strings) are given in the key
payload.  Specifically, when separating an option string into name and
value, if there is no value then the name is incorrectly considered to
end at the end of the key payload, rather than the end of the current
option.  This bypasses validation of the option length, and also means
that specifying multiple options is broken -- which presumably has gone
unnoticed as there is currently only one valid option anyway.

A similar problem also applied to option values, as the kstrtoul() when
parsing the "dnserror" option will read past the end of the current
option and into the next option.

Fix these bugs by correctly computing the length of the option name and
by copying the option value, null-terminated, into a temporary buffer.

Reproducer for the WARN_ONCE() that syzbot hit:

    perl -e 'print "#A#", "\0" x 50000' | keyctl padd dns_resolver desc @s

Reproducer for "dnserror" option being parsed incorrectly (expected
behavior is to fail when seeing the unknown option "foo", actual
behavior was to read the dnserror value as "1#foo" and fail there):

    perl -e 'print "#dnserror=1#foo\0"' | keyctl padd dns_resolver desc @s
