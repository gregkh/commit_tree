ASoC: omap: sdma-pcm: Correction for the include files

The sdma-pcm does not need any information from omap-dma.h, it only needs
to include the omap-dmaengine.h - for the omap_dma_filter_fn, but that
might not be needed at all as OMAP1 was converted to dma_slave_map, but
I can not test OMAP1.

Add the linux/device.h include as well for devm_kzalloc()
