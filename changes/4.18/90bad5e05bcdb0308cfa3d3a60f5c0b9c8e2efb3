root dentries need RCU-delayed freeing

Since mountpoint crossing can happen without leaving lazy mode,
root dentries do need the same protection against having their
memory freed without RCU delay as everything else in the tree.

It's partially hidden by RCU delay between detaching from the
mount tree and dropping the vfsmount reference, but the starting
point of pathwalk can be on an already detached mount, in which
case umount-caused RCU delay has already passed by the time the
lazy pathwalk grabs rcu_read_lock().  If the starting point
happens to be at the root of that vfsmount *and* that vfsmount
covers the entire filesystem, we get trouble.
