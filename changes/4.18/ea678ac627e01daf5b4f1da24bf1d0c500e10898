powerpc64/ftrace: Add a field in paca to disable ftrace in unsafe code paths

We have some C code that we call into from real mode where we cannot
take any exceptions. Though the C functions themselves are mostly safe,
if these functions are traced, there is a possibility that we may take
an exception. For instance, in certain conditions, the ftrace code uses
WARN(), which uses a 'trap' to do its job.

For such scenarios, introduce a new field in paca 'ftrace_enabled',
which is checked on ftrace entry before continuing. This field can then
be set to zero to disable/pause ftrace, and set to a non-zero value to
resume ftrace.
