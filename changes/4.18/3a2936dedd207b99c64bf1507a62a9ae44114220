kvm: mmu: Don't expose private memslots to L2

These private pages have special purposes in the virtualization of L1,
but not in the virtualization of L2. In particular, L1's APIC access
page should never be entered into L2's page tables, because this
causes a great deal of confusion when the APIC virtualization hardware
is being used to accelerate L2's accesses to its own APIC.
