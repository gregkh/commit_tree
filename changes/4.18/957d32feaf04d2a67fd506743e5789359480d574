drm/i915/stolen: Deduce base of reserved portion as top-size on vlv

On Valleyview, the HW deduces the base of the reserved portion of stolen
memory as being (top - size) and the address field within
GEN6_STOLEN_RESERVED is set to 0. Add yet another GEN6_STOLEN_RESERVED
reader to cope with the subtly different path required for vlv.

v2: Avoid using reserved_base = reserved_size = 0 as the invalid
condition as that typically falls outside of the stolen region,
provoking a consistency error.
