bluetooth: hci_nokia: Don't include linux/unaligned/le_struct.h directly.

This breaks the build as this header is not meant to be used in this
way.

./include/linux/unaligned/access_ok.h:8:28: error: redefinition of ‘get_unaligned_le16’
 static __always_inline u16 get_unaligned_le16(const void *p)
                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In file included from drivers/bluetooth/hci_nokia.c:32:
./include/linux/unaligned/le_struct.h:7:19: note: previous definition of ‘get_unaligned_le16’ was here
 static inline u16 get_unaligned_le16(const void *p)

Use asm/unaligned.h instead.
