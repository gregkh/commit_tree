net: ethernet: gianfar_ethtool: get phc index through drvdata

Global variable gfar_phc_index was used to get and store
phc index through gianfar_ptp driver. However gianfar_ptp
had been renamed as ptp_qoriq for QorIQ common PTP driver.
This gfar_phc_index doesn't work any more, and the phc index
is stored in drvdata now. This patch is to support getting
phc index through ptp_qoriq drvdata.
