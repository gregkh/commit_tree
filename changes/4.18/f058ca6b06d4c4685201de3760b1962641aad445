liquidio: move a couple of functions to lio_core.c

To support the next patch in this series which has code that calls
octnet_get_link_stats from two different .c files, move that function (and
its dependency octnet_nic_stats_callback) to lio_core.c.  Remove
octnet_get_link_stats's static declaration and add its function prototype
in octeon_network.h.
