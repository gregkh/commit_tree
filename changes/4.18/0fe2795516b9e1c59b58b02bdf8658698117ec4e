posix-timers: Fix nanosleep_copyout() for CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME

Commit b5793b0d92c9 added support for building the nanosleep compat system
call on 32-bit architectures, but missed one change in nanosleep_copyout(),
which would trigger a BUG() as soon as any architecture is switched over to
use it.

Use the proper config symbol to enable the code path.
