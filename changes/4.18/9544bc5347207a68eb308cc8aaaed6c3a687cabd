sg: remove ->sg_magic member

This was introduced more than a decade ago when sg chaining was
added, but we never really caught anything with it. The scatterlist
entry size can be critical, since drivers allocate it, so remove
the magic member. Recently it's been triggering allocation stalls
and failures in NVMe.
