video: fbdev: savage: Replace mdelay with usleep_range in savage_init_hw

savage_init_hw() is never called in atomic context.

The call chains ending up at savage_init_hw() are:
[1] savage_init_hw() <- savagefb_probe()
[2] savage_init_hw() <- savagefb_resume()

savagefb_probe() is only set as ".probe" in struct pci_driver.
savagefb_resume) is only set as ".resume" in struct pci_driver.
These functions are not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, savage_init_hw()
calls mdelay() to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with usleep_range to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
