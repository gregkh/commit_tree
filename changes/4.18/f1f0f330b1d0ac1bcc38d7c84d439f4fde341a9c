ALSA: dice: add parameters of stream formats for models produced by TC Electronic

TC Electronic shipped some models with DICE ASICs. All of them just support
DICE original protocol and drivers can't retrieve all of available stream
formats without changing status of sampling transmission frequency
actually.

This commit puts some hard-coded parameters for the models. When detecting
the models, the corresponding parameters are copied as cache of stream
formats.
