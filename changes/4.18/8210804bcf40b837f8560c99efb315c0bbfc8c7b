ASoC: rt5640: Add jack-detect support

Add jack-detect support, loosely based on earlier work on this by:

Pierre-Louis Bossart <pierre-louis.bossart@linux.intel.com>
Francisco mendez <francisco.mendez@intel.com>

Note getting the OVCD to work reliable was sort of finicky, so there are
quite a few comments on this to hopefully avoid people breaking it in the
future.

This (and the follow-up button press support) has been tested on the
following devices:

Acer Iconia Tab 8 W1-810
Asus T100CHI
Asus T100TA
Asus T200TA
Axxo WT1011
Chuwi Vi8
Dell Venue 8 Pro 5830
HP Pavilion X2 10-n000nd
HP Stream 7
I.T. Works TW891
Lamina I8270
MSI S100
Peaq C1010
Pipo W4
PoV MobiiTAB-P800W (v2.0)
Toshiba Click Mini L9W-B
