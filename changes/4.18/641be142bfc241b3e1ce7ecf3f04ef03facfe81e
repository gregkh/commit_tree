drm/msm: don't deref error pointer in the msm_fbdev_create error path

Currently the error pointer returned by msm_alloc_stolen_fb gets passed
to drm_framebuffer_remove. The latter handles only NULL pointers, thus
a nasty crash will occur.

Drop the unnecessary fail label and the associated checks - both err and
fb will be set at this stage.
