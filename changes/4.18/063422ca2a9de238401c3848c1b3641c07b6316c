ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Set card long_name based on quirks

Many X86 devices using a BYT SoC + RT5640 codec are cheap devices with
generic DMI strings, causing snd_soc_set_dmi_name() to fail to set a
long_name, making it impossible for userspace to have a correct UCM
profile which only uses inputs / outputs which are actually hooked up
on the device.

Our quirks already specify which input the internal mic is connected to
and if a single (mono) speaker is used or if the device has stereo
speakers.

This commit sets a long_name based on the quirks so that userspace can
have UCM profiles doing the right thing based on the long_name.

Note that if we ever encounter the need for a special UCM profile for
some device we can add a quirk to set a specific long_name for the
device,
