nfp: reset local locks on init

NFP locks record the owner when held, for PCIe devices the owner
ID will be the PCIe link number.  When driver loads it should scan
known locks and if they indicate that they are held by local
endpoint but the driver doesn't hold them - release them.

Locks can be left taken for instance when kernel gets kexec-ed or
after a crash.  Management FW tries to clean up stale locks too,
but it currently depends on PCIe link going down which doesn't
always happen.
