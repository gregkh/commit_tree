ACPI / battery: Add quirk to avoid checking for PMIC with native driver

With commit dccfae6d4f4c (ACPI / battery: Add a blacklist with PMIC ACPI
HIDs with a native battery driver) a blacklist was introduced to avoid
using the ACPI drivers for the battery when a native PMIC driver was
already present. While this is in general a good idea (because of broken
DSDT or proprietary and undocumented ACPI opregions for the ACPI battery
devices) there are some Cherry Trail devices which use a separate FG
controller despite the AXP288 having a builtin FG.

The net effect of blacklisting the ACPI drivers is that on these devices
the battery reporting is broken since the AXP288 PMIC FG bits are not
actually used on this hardware.

This commit adds a battery_do_not_check_pmic quirk for this and sets
this on the 2 devices currently known to use a separate FG controller,
the ECS EF20EA and the Lenovo Ideapad Miix 320.

[hdegoede@redhat.com: Merge the quirk handling and the adding of the DMI
 table entry into 1 commit, add a second DMI entry for the Miix 320.]
