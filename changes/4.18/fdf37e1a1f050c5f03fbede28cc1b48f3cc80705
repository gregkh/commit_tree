phy: qcom-qmp: Enable pipe_clk before PHY initialization

QMP PHY for USB/PCIE requires pipe_clk for locking of
retime buffers at the pipe interface. Driver checks for
PHY_STATUS without enabling pipe_clk due to which
phy_init() fails with initialization timeout.
Though pipe_clk is output from PHY (after PLL is programmed
during initialization sequence) to GCC clock_ctl and then fed
back to PHY but for PHY_STATUS register to reflect successful
initialization pipe_clk from GCC must be present.
Since, clock driver now ignores status_check for pipe_clk on
clk_enable/disable, driver can safely enable/disable pipe_clk
from phy_init/exit.
