scsi: lpfc: Correct fw download error message

In situations when the firmware image in inappropriate for the chip
type, initial validation checks were light, allowing the checks to pass,
thus allowing the firmware to be downloaded.  Eventually, after the
download, the chip rejects the firmware but it is logged as a generic
firmware download error.

Revise the initial checks to validate the image vs asic type so that the
correct message is displayed and the download process is avoided.
