ALSA: hda/realtek - two more lenovo models need fixup of MIC_LOCATION

We have two new lenovo desktop models which need to apply the fixup of
ALC294_FIXUP_LENOVO_MIC_LOCATION, and they have the same pin cfg as
the machine with subsystem id:0x17aa3136, now use the pincfg table
to apply the fixup for them.
