platform/x86: silead_dmi: Add info for the PoV mobii TAB-P800W (v2.0)

This commit adds the necessary device-properties to make the touchscreen
on Point of View mobii TAB-P800W (v2.0) tablets work.

Note that we already have an entry for the Point of View mobii
TAB-P800W (v2.1), that version uses a different digitizer and different
firmware, so the v2.0 version needs its own entry.
