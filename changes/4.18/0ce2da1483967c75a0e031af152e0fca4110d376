perf stat: Display user and system time

Adding the support to read rusage data once the workload is finished and
display the system/user time values:

  $ perf stat --null perf bench sched pipe
  ...

   Performance counter stats for 'perf bench sched pipe':

       5.342599256 seconds time elapsed

       2.544434000 seconds user
       4.549691000 seconds sys

It works only in non -r mode and only for workload target.

So as of now, for workload targets, we display 3 types of timings. The
time we meassure in perf stat from enable to disable+period:

       5.342599256 seconds time elapsed

The time spent in user and system lands, displayed only for workload
session/target:

       2.544434000 seconds user
       4.549691000 seconds sys

Those times are the very same displayed by 'time' tool.  They are
returned by wait4 call via the getrusage struct interface.

Committer notes:

Had to rename some variables to avoid this on older systems such as
centos:6:

  builtin-stat.c: In function 'print_footer':
  builtin-stat.c:1831: warning: declaration of 'stime' shadows a global declaration
  /usr/include/time.h:297: warning: shadowed declaration is here

Committer testing:

  # perf stat --null time perf bench sched pipe
  # Running 'sched/pipe' benchmark:
  # Executed 1000000 pipe operations between two processes

       Total time: 5.526 [sec]
