sfc: stop the TX queue before pushing new buffers

efx_enqueue_skb() can push new buffers for the xmit_more functionality.
We must stops the TX queue before this or else the TX queue does not get
restarted and we get a netdev watchdog.

In the error handling we may now need to unwind more than 1 packet, and
we may need to push the new buffers onto the partner queue.

v2: In the error leg also push this queue if xmit_more is set
