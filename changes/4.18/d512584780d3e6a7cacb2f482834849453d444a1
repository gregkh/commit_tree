squashfs: more metadata hardening

Anatoly reports another squashfs fuzzing issue, where the decompression
parameters themselves are in a compressed block.

This causes squashfs_read_data() to be called in order to read the
decompression options before the decompression stream having been set
up, making squashfs go sideways.
