mtd: rawnand: fsl_ifc: fix probe function error path

An error after nand_scan_tail() should trigger a nand_cleanup().
The helper mtd_device_parse_register() returns an error code that should
be checked and nand_cleanup() called accordingly.

However, in this driver, fsl_ifc_chip_remove() which is called upon
error already triggers a nand_release() which is wrong, because a
nand_release() should be triggered only if an mtd_register() succeeded.

Move the nand_release() call out of the fsl_ifc_chip_remove() and put it
back in the *_remove() hook.
