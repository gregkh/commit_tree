cachefiles: Fix missing clear of the CACHEFILES_OBJECT_ACTIVE flag

In cachefiles_mark_object_active(), the new object is marked active and
then we try to add it to the active object tree.  If a conflicting object
is already present, we want to wait for that to go away.  After the wait,
we go round again and try to re-mark the object as being active - but it's
already marked active from the first time we went through and a BUG is
issued.

Fix this by clearing the CACHEFILES_OBJECT_ACTIVE flag before we try again.

Analysis from Kiran Kumar Modukuri:

[Impact]
Oops during heavy NFS + FSCache + Cachefiles

CacheFiles: Error: Overlong wait for old active object to go away.

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000002

CacheFiles: Error: Object already active kernel BUG at
fs/cachefiles/namei.c:163!

[Cause]
In a heavily loaded system with big files being read and truncated, an
fscache object for a cookie is being dropped and a new object being
looked. The new object being looked for has to wait for the old object
to go away before the new object is moved to active state.

[Fix]
Clear the flag 'CACHEFILES_OBJECT_ACTIVE' for the new object when
retrying the object lookup.

[Testcase]
Have run ~100 hours of NFS stress tests and have not seen this bug recur.

[Regression Potential]
 - Limited to fscache/cachefiles.
