drm/i915: Remove local timeline var from submit/unsubmit

Both request_submit and request_unsubmit deal with transferring the
request from the client's timeline onto the execution timeline and back
again. As both functions deal with a pair of timeline's, using a
shorthand for just one of them is slightly confusing, especially as the
different functions use the shorthand for the alternate timeline.
Instead, use the full version of each timeline so it should be easier to
keep track of the transfer between the request/client and the engine.

v2: Refactor the common lock+list_move
v3: Be clear we require the other timeline list to be locked as well.
