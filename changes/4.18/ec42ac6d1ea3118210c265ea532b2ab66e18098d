firmware: arm_scmi: improve exit paths and code readability

The existing code intends the good path to reduce the code which is so
uncommon. It's obvious to have more readable code with a goto used for
the error path. This patch adds more appropriate error paths and makes
code more readable. It also moves a error logging outside the scope of
locking.
