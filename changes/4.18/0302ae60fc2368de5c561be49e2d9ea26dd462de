NVMe: Add Quirk Delay before CHK RDY for Seagate Nytro Flash Storage

Add Seagate Nytro Flash Storage nvme drive to quirk list for
NVME_QUIRK_DELAY_BEFORE_CHK_RDY, which solves a bug where the drive is
probed on hot-add before the firmare is ready, I/O errors are generated
while reading sector 0, and linux is "unable to read partition table".
