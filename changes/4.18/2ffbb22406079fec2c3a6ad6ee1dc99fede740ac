tools/power turbostat: Fix logical node enumeration to allow for non-sequential physical nodes

turbostat fails on some multi-package topologies because the logical node
enumeration assumes that the nodes are sequentially numbered,
which causes the logical numa nodes to not be enumerated, or enumerated incorrectly.

Use a more robust enumeration algorithm which allows for non-seqential physical nodes.
