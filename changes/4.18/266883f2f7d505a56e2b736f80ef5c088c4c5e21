scsi: zfcp: decouple TMF response handler from scsi_cmnd

Originally, I planned for TMF handling to have different context data in
fsf_req->data depending on the TMF scope in fcp_cmnd->fc_tm_flags:

 * scsi_device if FCP_TMF_LUN_RESET,
 * zfcp_port if FCP_TMF_TGT_RESET.

However, the FCP channel requires a valid LUN handle so we now use
scsi_device as context data with any TMF for the time being.

Regular SCSI I/O FCP requests continue using scsi_cmnd as req->data.

Hence, the callers of zfcp_fsf_fcp_handler_common() must resolve req->data
and pass scsi_device as common context.  While at it, remove the detour
zfcp_sdev->port->adapter and use the more direct req->adapter as elsewhere
in this function already.
