ARM64: dts: meson-axg: fix ethernet stability issue

Like the odroid-c2 and wetek, the s400 uses the RTL8211F and seems to
suffer from the kind of stability issue.

Doing an iperf3 download test, we can see a significant number of LPI
interrupts on the tx path. After a short while (5 to 15 seconds), the
network connection dies. If using rootfs over NFS, the connection may
also break during the boot sequence.

We still don't have a real explanation for this problem so let's disable
EEE once again.
