ALSA: seq: Fix UBSAN warning at SNDRV_SEQ_IOCTL_QUERY_NEXT_CLIENT ioctl

The kernel may spew a WARNING with UBSAN undefined behavior at
handling ALSA sequencer ioctl SNDRV_SEQ_IOCTL_QUERY_NEXT_CLIENT:

UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in sound/core/seq/seq_clientmgr.c:2007:14
signed integer overflow:
2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type 'int'
Call Trace:

It happens only when INT_MAX is passed there, as we're incrementing it
unconditionally.  So the fix is trivial, check the value with
INT_MAX.  Although the bug itself is fairly harmless, it's better to
fix it so that fuzzers won't hit this again later.
