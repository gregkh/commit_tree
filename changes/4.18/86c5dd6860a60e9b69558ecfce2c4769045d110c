pinctrl: cherryview: limit Strago DMI workarounds to version 1.0

As Google/Intel will fix the BIOS/Coreboot issues with hardcoding
virtual interrupt numbers for keyboard/touchpad/touchscreen controllers
in ACPI tables, they will also update BOARD version number from 1.0
to 1.1. Let's limit the DMI quirks that try to preserve virtual IRQ
numbers on Strago boards to those that still carry older BIOSes.

Note that ideally not BOARD but BIOS version should have been updated.
However the BIOS version used by Chrome devices has format of
Google_BUILD.BRANCH.PATCH which is not well suited for DMI matching as
we do not have "less than" match mode for DMI data.
