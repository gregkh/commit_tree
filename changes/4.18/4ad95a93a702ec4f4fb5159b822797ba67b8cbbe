qed: Fix link flap issue due to mismatching EEE capabilities.

Apparently, MFW publishes EEE capabilities even for Fiber-boards that don't
support them, and later since qed internally sets adv_caps it would cause
link-flap avoidance (LFA) to fail when driver would initiate the link.
This in turn delays the link, causing traffic to fail.

Driver has been modified to not to ask MFW for any EEE config if EEE isn't
to be enabled.
