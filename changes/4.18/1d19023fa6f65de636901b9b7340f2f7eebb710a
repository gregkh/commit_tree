cxgb4: change the port capability bits definition

MDI Port Capabilities bit definitions were inconsistent with
regard to the MDI enum values. 2 bits used to define MDI in
the port capabilities are not really separable, it's a 2-bit
field with 4 different values. Change the port capability bit
definitions to be "AUTO" and "STRAIGHT" in order to get them
to line up with the enum's.
