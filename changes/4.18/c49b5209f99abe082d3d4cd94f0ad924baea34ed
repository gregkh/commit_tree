pnfs: Add barrier to prevent lgopen using LAYOUTGET during recall

Since the LAYOUTGET on OPEN can be sent without prior inode information,
existing methods to prevent LAYOUTGET from being sent while processing
CB_LAYOUTRECALL don't work.  Track if a recall occurred while LAYOUTGET
was being sent, and if so ignore the results.
