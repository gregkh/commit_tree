Btrfs: fix error handling in btrfs_truncate_inode_items()

btrfs_truncate_inode_items() uses two variables for error handling, ret
and err. These are not handled consistently, leading to a couple of
bugs.

- Errors from btrfs_del_items() are handled but not propagated to the
  caller
- If btrfs_run_delayed_refs() fails and aborts the transaction, we
  continue running

Just use ret everywhere and simplify things a bit, fixing both of these
issues.
