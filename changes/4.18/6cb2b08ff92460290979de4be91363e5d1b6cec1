x86/pti: Don't report XenPV as vulnerable

Xen PV domain kernel is not by design affected by meltdown as it's
enforcing split CR3 itself. Let's not report such systems as "Vulnerable"
in sysfs (we're also already forcing PTI to off in X86_HYPER_XEN_PV cases);
the security of the system ultimately depends on presence of mitigation in
the Hypervisor, which can't be easily detected from DomU; let's report
that.
