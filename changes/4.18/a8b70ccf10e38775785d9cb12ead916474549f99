dt-bindings: phy-qcom-usb2: Add support to override tuning values

To improve eye diagram for PHYs on different boards of same SOC,
some parameters may need to be changed. Provide device tree
properties to override these from board specific device tree
files. While at it, replace "qcom,qusb2-v2-phy" with compatible
string for USB2 PHY on sdm845 which was earlier added for
sdm845 only.
