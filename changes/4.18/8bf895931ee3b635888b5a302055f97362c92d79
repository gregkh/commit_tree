workqueue: Set worker->desc to workqueue name by default

Work functions can use set_worker_desc() to improve the visibility of
what the worker task is doing.  Currently, the desc field is unset at
the beginning of each execution and there is a separate field to track
the field is set during the current execution.

Instead of leaving empty till desc is set, worker->desc can be used to
remember the last workqueue the worker worked on by default and users
that use set_worker_desc() can override it to something more
informative as necessary.

This simplifies desc handling and helps tracking the last workqueue
that the worker exected on to improve visibility.
