btrfs: add FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR ioctl

The new ioctl is an extension to the FS_IOC_GETFLAGS and adds new
flags and is extensible. This patch allows to return the xflags portion
of the fsxattr structure, other items have no meaning for btrfs or can
be added later.

The original patch was written by Chandan Jay Sharma but was incomplete
and no further revision has been sent. Several cleanups were necessary
to avoid confusion with other ioctls, as we have another flavor of
flags.
