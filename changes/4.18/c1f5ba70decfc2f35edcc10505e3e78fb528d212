spi: Get rid of the spi_flash_read() API

This API has been replaced by the spi_mem_xx() one, its only user
(spi-nor) has been converted to spi_mem_xx() and all SPI controller
drivers that were implementing the ->spi_flash_xxx() hooks are also
implementing the spi_mem ones. So we can safely get rid of this API.
