rcu: The rcu_gp_cleanup() function does not need cpu_needs_another_gp()

All of the cpu_needs_another_gp() function's checks (except for
newly arrived callbacks) have been subsumed into the rcu_gp_cleanup()
function's scan of the rcu_node tree.  This commit therefore drops the
call to cpu_needs_another_gp().  The check for newly arrived callbacks
is supplied by rcu_accelerate_cbs().  Any needed advancing (as in the
earlier rcu_advance_cbs() call) will be supplied when the corresponding
CPU becomes aware of the end of the now-completed grace period.
