hwspinlock: Introduce one new mode for hwspinlock

In some scenarios, user need do some time-consuming or sleepable
operations under the hardware spinlock protection for synchronization
between the multiple subsystems.

For example, there is one PMIC efuse on Spreadtrum platform, which
need to be accessed under one hardware lock. But during the hardware
lock protection, the efuse operation is time-consuming to almost 5 ms,
so we can not disable the interrupts or preemption so long in this case.

Thus we can introduce one new mode to indicate that we just acquire the
hardware lock and do not disable interrupts or preemption, meanwhile we
should force user to protect the hardware lock with mutex or spinlock to
avoid dead-lock.
