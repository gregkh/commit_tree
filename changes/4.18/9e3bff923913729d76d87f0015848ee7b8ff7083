net: systemport: Fix CRC forwarding check for SYSTEMPORT Lite

SYSTEMPORT Lite reversed the logic compared to SYSTEMPORT, the
GIB_FCS_STRIP bit is set when the Ethernet FCS is stripped, and that bit
is not set by default. Fix the logic such that we properly check whether
that bit is set or not and we don't forward an extra 4 bytes to the
network stack.
