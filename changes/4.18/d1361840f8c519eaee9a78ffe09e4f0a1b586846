tcp: fix SO_RCVLOWAT and RCVBUF autotuning

Applications might use SO_RCVLOWAT on TCP socket hoping to receive
one [E]POLLIN event only when a given amount of bytes are ready in socket
receive queue.

Problem is that receive autotuning is not aware of this constraint,
meaning sk_rcvbuf might be too small to allow all bytes to be stored.

Add a new (struct proto_ops)->set_rcvlowat method so that a protocol
can override the default setsockopt(SO_RCVLOWAT) behavior.
