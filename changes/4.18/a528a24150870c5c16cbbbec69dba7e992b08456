btrfs: change return type of btrfs_page_mkwrite to vm_fault_t

Use the new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler. For now, this is
just documenting that the function returns a VM_FAULT value rather than
an errno. Once all instances are converted, vm_fault_t will become a
distinct type.

Reference commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

vmf_error() is the newly introduced inline function in 4.17-rc6.
