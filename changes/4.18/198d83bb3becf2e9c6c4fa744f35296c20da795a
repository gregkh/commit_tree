bpf: make generic xdp compatible w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail

w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail helper xdp's data_end pointer could be changed as
well (only "decrease" of pointer's location is going to be supported).
changing of this pointer will change packet's size.
for generic XDP we need to reflect this packet's length change by
adjusting skb's tail pointer
