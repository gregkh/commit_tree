selftests/bpf: test for seg6local End.BPF action

Add a new test for the seg6local End.BPF action. The following helpers
are also tested:

- bpf_lwt_push_encap within the LWT BPF IN hook
- bpf_lwt_seg6_action
- bpf_lwt_seg6_adjust_srh
- bpf_lwt_seg6_store_bytes

A chain of End.BPF actions is built. The SRH is injected through a LWT
BPF IN hook before entering this chain. Each End.BPF action validates
the previous one, otherwise the packet is dropped. The test succeeds
if the last node in the chain receives the packet and the UDP datagram
contained can be retrieved from userspace.
