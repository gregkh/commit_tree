staging: lustre: rearrange placement of CPU partition management code.

Currently the code for cpu-partition tables lives in various places.
The non-SMP code is partly in libcfs/libcfs_cpu.h as static inlines,
and partly in lnet/libcfs/libcfs_cpu.c - some of the functions are
tiny and could well be inlines.

The SMP code is all in lnet/libcfs/linux/linux-cpu.c.

This patch moves all the trivial non-SMP functions into
libcfs_cpu.h as inlines, and all the SMP functions into libcfs_cpu.c
with the non-trival !SMP code.

Now when you go looking for some function, it is easier to find both
versions together when neither is trivial.

There is no code change here - just code movement.
