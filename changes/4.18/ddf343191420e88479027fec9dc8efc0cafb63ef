drm/i915/skl+: support verification of DDB HW state for NV12

For YUV 420 Planar formats like NV12,
buffer allocation is done for Y and UV surfaces separately.
For NV12 plane formats, the UV buffer
allocation must be programmed in the Plane Buffer Config register
and the Y buffer allocation must be programmed in the
Plane NV12 Buffer Config register. Both register values
should be verified during verify_wm_state.
