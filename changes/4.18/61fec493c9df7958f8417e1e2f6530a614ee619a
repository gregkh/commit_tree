get rid of dead code in d_find_alias()

All "try disconnected alias if nothing else fits" logics in d_find_alias()
got accidentally disabled by Neil a while ago; for most of the callers it
was the right thing to do, so fixes belong in few callers that *do* want
disconnected aliases.  This just takes the now-dead code in d_find_alias()
out.
