kconfig: support append assignment operator

Support += operator.  This appends a space and the text on the
righthand side to a variable.

The timing of the evaluation of the righthand side depends on the
flavor of the variable.  If the lefthand side was originally defined
as a simple variable, the righthand side is expanded immediately.
Otherwise, the expansion is deferred.  Appending something to an
undefined variable results in a recursive variable.

To implement this, we need to remember the flavor of variables.
