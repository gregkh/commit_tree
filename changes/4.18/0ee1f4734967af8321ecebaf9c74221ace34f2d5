r8152: napi hangup fix after disconnect

When unplugging an r8152 adapter while the interface is UP, the NIC
becomes unusable.  usb->disconnect (aka rtl8152_disconnect) deletes
napi. Then, rtl8152_disconnect calls unregister_netdev and that invokes
netdev->ndo_stop (aka rtl8152_close). rtl8152_close tries to
napi_disable, but the napi is already deleted by disconnect above. So
the first while loop in napi_disable never finishes. This results in
complete deadlock of the network layer as there is rtnl_mutex held by
unregister_netdev.

So avoid the call to napi_disable in rtl8152_close when the device is
already gone.

The other calls to usb_kill_urb, cancel_delayed_work_sync,
netif_stop_queue etc. seem to be fine. The urb and netdev is not
destroyed yet.
