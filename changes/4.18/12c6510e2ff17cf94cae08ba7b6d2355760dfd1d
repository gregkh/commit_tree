xfs: add helpers to dispose of old btree blocks after a repair

Now that we've plumbed in the ability to construct a list of dead btree
blocks following a repair, add more helpers to dispose of them.  This is
done by examining the rmapbt -- if the btree was the only owner we can
free the block, otherwise it's crosslinked and we can only remove the
rmapbt record.
