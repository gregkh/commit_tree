thermal: Shorten name of sysfs callbacks

The naming isn't consistent across all sysfs callbacks in the thermal
core, some have a short name like type_show() and others have long names
like thermal_cooling_device_weight_show(). This patch tries to make it
consistent by shortening the name of sysfs callbacks.

Some of the sysfs files are named similarly for both thermal zone and
cooling device (like: type) and to avoid name clash between their
show/store routines, the cooling device specific sysfs callbacks are
prefixed with "cdev_".
