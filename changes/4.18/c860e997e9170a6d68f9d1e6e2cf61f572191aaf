tcp: fix Fast Open key endianness

Fast Open key could be stored in different endian based on the CPU.
Previously hosts in different endianness in a server farm using
the same key config (sysctl value) would produce different cookies.
This patch fixes it by always storing it as little endian to keep
same API for LE hosts.
