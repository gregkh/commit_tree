livepatch: Remove not longer valid limitations from the documentation

Semantic changes are possible since the commit d83a7cb375eec21f04
("livepatch: change to a per-task consistency model").

Also data structures can be patched since the commit 439e7271dc2b63de37
("livepatch: introduce shadow variable API").

It is a high time we removed these limitations from the documentation.
