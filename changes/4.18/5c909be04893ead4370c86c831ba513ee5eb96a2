media: usbtv: Use same decoder sequence as Windows driver

Re-format the register {address, value} pairs so they follow the same
order as the decoder configuration sequences in the Windows driver's .INF
file.

For instance, for PAL, the "AVPAL" sequence in the .INF file is:
0x04,0x68,0xD3,0x72,0xA2,0xB0,0x15,0x01,0x2C,0x10,0x20,0x2e,0x08,0x02,
0x02,0x59,0x16,0x35,0x17,0x16,0x36
