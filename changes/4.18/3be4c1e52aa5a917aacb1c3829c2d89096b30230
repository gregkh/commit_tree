tracing: Allow histogram triggers to access ftrace internal events

Now that trace_marker can have triggers, including a histogram triggers, the
onmatch() and onmax() access the trace event. To do so, the search routine
to find the event file needs to use the raw __find_event_file() that does
not filter out ftrace events.
