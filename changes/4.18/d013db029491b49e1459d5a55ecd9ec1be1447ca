seccomp: Separate read and write code for actions_logged sysctl

Break the read and write paths of the kernel.seccomp.actions_logged
sysctl into separate functions to maintain readability. An upcoming
change will need to audit writes, but not reads, of this sysctl which
would introduce too many conditional code paths on whether or not the
'write' parameter evaluates to true.
