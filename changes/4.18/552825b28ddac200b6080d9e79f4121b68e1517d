drm/amdgpu: add new bo flag that indicates BOs don't need fallback (v2)

user cases:
1. KFD wraps amdgpu_bo_create, they have no fallback case which is different
with amdgpu_gem_object_create.
since upstream branch has no amdgpu_amdkfd_gpuvm.c, which need KFD
guys add this flag to __alloc_memory_of_gpu:
+       flags |= AMDGPU_GEM_CREATE_NO_FALLBACK;
2. UMD can specify this flag for their allocation as well if they like.

v2: squash in merge conflict fix (Chunming)
