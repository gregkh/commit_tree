scsi: libsas: add transport class for ATA devices

Now ata devices attached with sas controller do not have transport
class, so that we can not see any information of these ata devices in
/sys/class/ata_port(or ata_link or ata_device).

Add transport class for the ata devices attached with sas controller.
The /sys/class directory will show the infomation of the ata devices
as follows:

localhost:/sys/class # ls ata*
ata_device:
dev1.0  dev2.0

ata_link:
link1  link2

ata_port:
ata1  ata2

No functional change of the device scanning and io path. The ata
transport class was deleted when destroying the sas devices.
