net/ipv4: Udate fib_table_lookup tracepoint

Commit 4a2d73a4fb36 ("ipv4: fib_rules: support match on sport, dport
and ip proto") added support for protocol and ports to FIB rules.
Update the FIB lookup tracepoint to dump the parameters.

In addition, make the IPv4 tracepoint similar to the IPv6 one where
the lookup parameters and result are dumped in 1 event. It is much
easier to use and understand the outcome of the lookup.
