x86/mm: Mark p4d_offset() __always_inline

__pgtable_l5_enabled shouldn't be needed after system has booted, we can
mark it as __initdata, but it requires preparation.

KASAN initialization code is a user of USE_EARLY_PGTABLE_L5, so all
pgtable_l5_enabled() translated to __pgtable_l5_enabled there, including
the one in p4d_offset().

It may lead to section mismatch, if a compiler would not inline
p4d_offset(), but leave it as a standalone function: p4d_offset() is not
marked as __init.

Marking p4d_offset() as __always_inline fixes the issue.
