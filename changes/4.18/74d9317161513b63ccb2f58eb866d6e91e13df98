genksyms: remove symbol prefix support

CONFIG_HAVE_UNDERSCORE_SYMBOL_PREFIX was selected by BLACKFIN, METAG.
They were removed by commit 4ba66a976072 ("arch: remove blackfin port"),
commit bb6fb6dfcc17 ("metag: Remove arch/metag/"), respectively.

No more architecture enables CONFIG_HAVE_UNDERSCORE_SYMBOL_PREFIX,
hence the -s (--symbol-prefix) option is unnecessary.
