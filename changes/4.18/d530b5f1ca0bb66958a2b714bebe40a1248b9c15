drm: re-enable error handling

drm_legacy_ctxbitmap_next() returns idr_alloc() which can return
-ENOMEM, -EINVAL or -ENOSPC none of which are -1 . but the call sites
of drm_legacy_ctxbitmap_next() seem to be assuming that the error case
would be -1 (original return of drm_ctxbitmap_next() prior to 2.6.23
was actually -1). Thus reenable error handling by checking for < 0.
