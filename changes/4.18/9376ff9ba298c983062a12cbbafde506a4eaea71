LICENSES/GPL2.0: Add GPL-2.0-only/or-later as valid identifiers

Quite some files have been flagged with the new GPL-2.0-only and
GPL-2.0-or-later identifiers which replace the original GPL-2.0 and
GPL-2.0+ identifiers in the SPDX license identifier specification, but the
identifiers are not mentioned as valid in the GPL-2.0 license file.

Add them to the license file and to the Linux-syscall-note exception to
make everything consistent again.
