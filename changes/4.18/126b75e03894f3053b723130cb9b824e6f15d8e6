ALSA: hda/ca0132: Don't test for QUIRK_NONE

QUIRK_NONE is, quite explicitly, the default case.  The entire
point of a quirks system is to allow "programming by difference"
from a given base case, which requires that merely defining a new
quirk for some piece of hardware should not change the behavior of
the driver for that hardware.  In turn, this means that testing
for QUIRK_NONE explicitly is a violation of that implicit contract.

Change a test for QUIRK_NONE and QUIRK_ALIENWARE to default, and
add a test for QUIRK_SBZ to disable the default behavior in that
instance.
