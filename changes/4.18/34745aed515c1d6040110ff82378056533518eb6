samples/bpf: fix kprobe attachment issue on x64

Commit d5a00528b58c ("syscalls/core, syscalls/x86: Rename
struct pt_regs-based sys_*() to __x64_sys_*()") renamed a lot
of syscall function sys_*() to __x64_sys_*().
This caused several kprobe based samples/bpf tests failing.

This patch fixed the problem in bpf_load.c.
For x86_64 architecture, function name __x64_sys_*() will be
first used for kprobe event creation. If the creation is successful,
it will be used. Otherwise, function name sys_*() will be used
for kprobe event creation.
