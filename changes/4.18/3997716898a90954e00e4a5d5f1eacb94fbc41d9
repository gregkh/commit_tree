media: rcar-vin: fix crop and compose handling for Gen3

When refactoring the Gen3 enablement series crop and compose handling
where broken. This went unnoticed but can result in writing out side the
capture buffer. Fix this by restoring the crop and compose to reflect
the format dimensions as we have not yet enabled the scaler for Gen3.
