dt-bindings: Document the DT bindings for lan78xx

The Microchip LAN78XX family of devices are Ethernet controllers with
a USB interface. Despite being discoverable devices it can be useful to
be able to configure them from Device Tree, particularly in low-cost
applications without an EEPROM or programmed OTP.

Document the supported properties in a bindings file.
