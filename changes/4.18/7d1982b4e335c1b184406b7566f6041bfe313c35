bpf: fix panic in prog load calls cleanup

While testing I found that when hitting error path in bpf_prog_load()
where we jump to free_used_maps and prog contained BPF to BPF calls
that were JITed earlier, then we never clean up the bpf_prog_kallsyms_add()
done under jit_subprogs(). Add proper API to make BPF kallsyms deletion
more clear and fix that.
