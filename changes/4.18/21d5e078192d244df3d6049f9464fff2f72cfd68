netfilter: nft_compat: explicitly reject ERROR and standard target

iptables-nft never requests these, but make this explicitly illegal.
If it were quested, kernel could oops as ->eval is NULL, furthermore,
the builtin targets have no owning module so its possible to rmmod
eb/ip/ip6_tables module even if they would be loaded.
