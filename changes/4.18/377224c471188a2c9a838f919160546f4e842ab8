f2fs: don't split checkpoint in fstrim

Now, we issue discard asynchronously in separated thread instead of in
checkpoint, after that, we won't encounter long latency in checkpoint
due to huge number of synchronous discard command handling, so, we don't
need to split checkpoint to do trim in batch, merge it and obsolete
related sysfs entry.
