net/mlx4_en: Don't reuse RX page when XDP is set

When a new rx packet arrives, the rx path will decide whether to reuse
the remainder of the page or not according to one of the below conditions:
1. frag_info->frag_stride == PAGE_SIZE / 2
2. frags->page_offset + frag_info->frag_size > PAGE_SIZE;

The first condition is no met for when XDP is set.
For XDP, page_offset is always set to priv->rx_headroom which is
XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM and frag_info->frag_size is around mtu size + some
padding, still the 2nd release condition will hold since
XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM + 1536 < PAGE_SIZE, as a result the page will not
be released and will be _wrongly_ reused for next free rx descriptor.

In XDP there is an assumption to have a page per packet and reuse can
break such assumption and might cause packet data corruptions.

Fix this by adding an extra condition (!priv->rx_headroom) to the 2nd
case to avoid page reuse when XDP is set, since rx_headroom is set to 0
for non XDP setup and set to XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM for XDP setup.

No additional cache line is required for the new condition.
