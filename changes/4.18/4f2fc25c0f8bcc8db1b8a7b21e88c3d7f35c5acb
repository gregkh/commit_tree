drm/nouveau/fifo/gk104-: poll for runlist update completion

Newer HW doesn't appear to send this event, which will cause long delays
in runlist updates if they don't complete immediately.

RM doesn't use these events anywhere, and an NVGPU commit message notes
that polling is the preferred method even on HW that supports the event.
