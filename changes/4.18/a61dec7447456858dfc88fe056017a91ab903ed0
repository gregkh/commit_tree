cpufreq: schedutil: Avoid missing updates for one-CPU policies

Commit 152db033d775 (schedutil: Allow cpufreq requests to be made
even when kthread kicked) made changes to prevent utilization updates
from being discarded during processing a previous request, but it
left a small window in which that still can happen in the one-CPU
policy case.  Namely, updates coming in after setting work_in_progress
in sugov_update_commit() and clearing it in sugov_work() will still
be dropped due to the work_in_progress check in sugov_update_single().

To close that window, rearrange the code so as to acquire the update
lock around the deferred update branch in sugov_update_single()
and drop the work_in_progress check from it.
