regulator: bd9571mwv: Add support for backup mode

The BD9571MWV PMIC supports backup mode, which keeps one or more DDR
rails powered while the main SoC is powered down.

Which DDR rails are to be kept powered is board-specific, and controlled
using the optional "rohm,ddr-backup-power" DT property.  In the absence
of this property, backup mode is not available.

Backup mode can be enabled or disabled by the user using the standard
"wakeup" virtual file in sysfs, e.g. to enable:

    echo enabled > /sys/devices/platform/soc/e60b0000.i2c/i2c-7/7-0030/bd9571mwv-regulator.2.auto/power/wakeup

When the PMIC is configured for backup mode, the role of the accessory
power switch changes from a power switch to a wake-up switch.
Two types of switches (or signals) can be used:
  A. With a momentary power switch (or pulse signal), the PMIC is
     configured for backup mode in the PMIC driver's suspend callback,
     during system suspend.
     Backup mode is enabled by default, as there is no further impact
     during normal system operation.

  B. With a toggle power switch (or level signal), the following steps
     must be followed exactly:
       1. Configure PMIC for backup mode,
       2. Switch accessory power switch off, to prepare for system
          suspend, which is a manual step not controlled by software,
       3. Suspend system.
     This mode is not yet supported by the driver.

As the switch type is board-specific, and cannot be determined
automatically, it is obtained from the presence of one of the
"rohm,rstbmode-*" properties in DT.
