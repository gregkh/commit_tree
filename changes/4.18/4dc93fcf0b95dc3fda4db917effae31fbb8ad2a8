igb: Fix queue selection on MAC filters on i210

On the RAH registers there are semantic differences on the meaning of
the "queue" parameter for traffic steering depending on the controller
model: there is the 82575 meaning, which "queue" means a RX Hardware
Queue, and the i350 meaning, where it is a reception pool.

The previous behaviour was having no effect for i210 based controllers
because the QSEL bit of the RAH register wasn't being set.

This patch separates the condition in discrete cases, so the different
handling is clearer.
