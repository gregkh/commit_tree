staging: ks7010: ks7010: factor out firmware copy process into ks7010_copy_firmware

This commit extracts firmware copy process into a new function
ks7010_copy_firmware. Because rom_buf is only needed for this
process, memory request for it has been also moved to this new
function so the error handling label release_host_and_free has
been renamed to release_host into ks7010_upload_firmware original
function.
