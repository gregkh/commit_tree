drm/i915/execlists: Track begin/end of execlists submission sequences

We would like to start doing some bookkeeping at the beginning, between
contexts and at the end of execlists submission. We already mark the
beginning and end using EXECLISTS_ACTIVE_USER, to provide an indication
when the HW is idle. This give us a pair of sequence points we can then
expand on for further bookkeeping.

v2: Refactor guc submission to share the same begin/end.
