kbuild: fix endless syncconfig in case arch Makefile sets CROSS_COMPILE

Commit 21c54b774744 ("kconfig: show compiler version text in the top
comment") was intended to detect the compiler upgrade, but Geert
reported a breakage on the m68k build.

The compiler upgrade is detected by the change of the environment
variable, CC_VERSION_TEXT, which contains the first line of the output
from $(CC) --version.  Currently, this works well when CROSS_COMPILE
is given via the environment variable or the Make command line.

However, some architectures such as m68k can specify CROSS_COMPILE
from arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile as well.  In this case, "make ARCH=m68k"
ends up with endless syncconfig loop.

  $ make ARCH=m68k defconfig
  *** Default configuration is based on 'multi_defconfig'
  #
  # configuration written to .config
  #
  $ make ARCH=m68k
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig

Things are happening like this:

Because arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile is included after CC_VERSION_TEXT
is set, it contains the host compiler version in the defconfig phase.

To create or update auto.conf, the following line is triggered:

include/config/%.conf: $(KCONFIG_CONFIG) include/config/auto.conf.cmd
        $(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/Makefile syncconfig

This recurses the top Makefile after arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile is
included.  CROSS_COMPILE is set to a m68k toolchain prefix and
exported to the recursed Make.  Then, syncconfig is invoked with
the target compiler version in CC_VERSION_TEXT.

The Make will restart because auto.conf and auto.conf.cmd have been
updated.  At this point, CROSS_COMPILE is reset, so CC_VERSION_TEXT
is set to the host compiler version again.  Then, syncconfig is
triggered due to the change of CC_VERSION_TEXT.  This loop continues
eternally.

To fix this problem, $(CC_VERSION_TEXT) must be evaluated only after
arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile.  Setting it earlier is OK as long as it is
defined by using the '=' operator instead of ':='.

For the defconfig phase, $(CC_VERSION_TEXT) is evaluated when Kbuild
descends into scripts/kconfig/, so it contains the target compiler
version correctly.

include/config/auto.conf.cmd references $(CC_VERSION_TEXT) as well,
so it must be included after arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile.
