ocfs2: clean up redundant function declarations

ocfs2_extend_allocation() has been deleted, clean up its declaration.
Also change the static function name from __ocfs2_extend_allocation() to
ocfs2_extend_allocation() to be consistent with the corresponding trace
events as well as comments for ocfs2_lock_allocators().
