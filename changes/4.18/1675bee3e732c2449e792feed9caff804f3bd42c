can: m_can: Fix runtime resume call

pm_runtime_get_sync() returns a 1 if the state of the device is already
'active'. This is not a failure case and should return a success.

Therefore fix error handling for pm_runtime_get_sync() call such that
it returns success when the value is 1.

Also cleanup the TODO for using runtime PM for sleep mode as that is
implemented.
