atomic: Add irqsave variant of atomic_dec_and_lock()

There are in-tree users of atomic_dec_and_lock() which must acquire the
spin lock with interrupts disabled. To workaround the lack of an irqsave
variant of atomic_dec_and_lock() they use local_irq_save() at the call
site. This causes extra code and creates in some places unneeded long
interrupt disabled times. These places need also extra treatment for
PREEMPT_RT due to the disconnect of the irq disabling and the lock
function.

Implement the missing irqsave variant of the function.
