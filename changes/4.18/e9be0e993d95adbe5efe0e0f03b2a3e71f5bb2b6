net: sched: shrink struct Qdisc

The struct Qdisc has a lot of holes, especially after commit
a53851e2c321 ("net: sched: explicit locking in gso_cpu fallback"),
which as a side effect, moved the fields just after 'busylock'
on a new cacheline.

Since both 'padded' and 'refcnt' are not updated frequently, and
there is a hole before 'gso_skb', we can move such fields there,
saving a cacheline without any performance side effect.

Before this commit:

pahole -C Qdisc net/sche/sch_generic.o
	# ...
        /* size: 384, cachelines: 6, members: 25 */
        /* sum members: 236, holes: 3, sum holes: 92 */
        /* padding: 56 */

After this commit:
pahole -C Qdisc net/sche/sch_generic.o
	# ...
	/* size: 320, cachelines: 5, members: 25 */
	/* sum members: 236, holes: 2, sum holes: 28 */
	/* padding: 56 */
