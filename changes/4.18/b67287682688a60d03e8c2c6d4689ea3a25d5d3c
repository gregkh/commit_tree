Btrfs: dedupe_file_range ioctl: remove 16MiB restriction

Currently btrfs_dedupe_file_range silently restricts the dedupe range to
to 16MiB to limit locking and working memory size and is documented in
manual page as implementation specific.

Let's remove that restriction by iterating over the dedup range in 16MiB
steps.  This is backward compatible and will not change anything for
requests smaller then 16MiB.
