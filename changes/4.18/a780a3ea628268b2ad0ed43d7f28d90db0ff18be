KVM: X86: Fix reserved bits check for MOV to CR3

MSB of CR3 is a reserved bit if the PCIDE bit is not set in CR4.
It should be checked when PCIDE bit is not set, however commit
'd1cd3ce900441 ("KVM: MMU: check guest CR3 reserved bits based on
its physical address width")' removes the bit 63 checking
unconditionally. This patch fixes it by checking bit 63 of CR3
when PCIDE bit is not set in CR4.
