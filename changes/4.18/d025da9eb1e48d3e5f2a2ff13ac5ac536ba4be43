s390/qeth: consistently re-enable device features

commit e830baa9c3f0 ("qeth: restore device features after recovery") and
commit ce3443564145 ("s390/qeth: rely on kernel for feature recovery")
made sure that the HW functions for device features get re-programmed
after recovery.

But we missed that the same handling is also required when a card is
first set offline (destroying all HW context), and then online again.
Fix this by moving the re-enable action out of the recovery-only path.
