scsi: cxlflash: Remove commmands from pending list on timeout

The following Oops can occur if an internal command sent to the AFU does not
complete within the timeout:

When an internal command times out, the command buffer is freed while it is
still in the pending commands list of the context. This corrupts the list and
when the context is cleaned up, a crash is encountered.

To resolve this issue, when an AFU command or TMF command times out, the
command should be deleted from the hardware queue pending command list before
freeing the buffer.
