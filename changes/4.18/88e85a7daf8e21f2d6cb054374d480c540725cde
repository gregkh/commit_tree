bpfilter: check compiler capability in Kconfig

With the brand-new syntax extension of Kconfig, we can directly
check the compiler capability in the configuration phase.

If the cc-can-link.sh fails, the BPFILTER_UMH is automatically
hidden by the dependency.

I also deleted 'default n', which is no-op.
