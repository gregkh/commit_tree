btrfs: add FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR ioctl

The new ioctl is an extension to the FS_IOC_SETFLAGS and adds new
flags and is extensible. Don't get fooled by the XATTR in the name, it
does not have anything in common with the extended attributes,
incidentally also abbreviated as XATTRs.

This patch allows to set the xflags portion of the fsxattr structure,
other items have no meaning and non-zero values will result in
EOPNOTSUPP.

Currently supported xflags:

- APPEND
- IMMUTABLE
- NOATIME
- NODUMP
- SYNC

The structure of btrfs_ioctl_fssetxattr copies btrfs_ioctl_setflags but
is simpler on the flag setting side.

The original patch was written by Chandan Jay Sharma but was incomplete
and no further revision has been sent.
