l2tp: fix pseudo-wire type for sessions created by pppol2tp_connect()

Define cfg.pw_type so that the new session is created with its .pwtype
field properly set (L2TP_PWTYPE_PPP).

Not setting the pseudo-wire type had several annoying effects:

  * Invalid value returned in the L2TP_ATTR_PW_TYPE attribute when
    dumping sessions with the netlink API.

  * Impossibility to delete the session using the netlink API (because
    l2tp_nl_cmd_session_delete() gets the deletion callback function
    from an array indexed by the session's pseudo-wire type).

Also, there are several cases where we should check a session's
pseudo-wire type. For example, pppol2tp_connect() should refuse to
connect a session that is not PPPoL2TP, but that requires the session's
.pwtype field to be properly set.
