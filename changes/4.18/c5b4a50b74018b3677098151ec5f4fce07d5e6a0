Btrfs: fix return value on rename exchange failure

If we failed during a rename exchange operation after starting/joining a
transaction, we would end up replacing the return value, stored in the
local 'ret' variable, with the return value from btrfs_end_transaction().
So this could end up returning 0 (success) to user space despite the
operation having failed and aborted the transaction, because if there are
multiple tasks having a reference on the transaction at the time
btrfs_end_transaction() is called by the rename exchange, that function
returns 0 (otherwise it returns -EIO and not the original error value).
So fix this by not overwriting the return value on error after getting
a transaction handle.
