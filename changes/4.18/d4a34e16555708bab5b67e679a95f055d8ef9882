xfs: properly handle free inodes in extent hint validators

When inodes are freed in xfs_ifree(), di_flags is cleared (so extent size
hints are removed) but the actual extent size fields are left intact.
This causes the extent hint validators to fail on freed inodes which once
had extent size hints.

This can be observed (for example) by running xfs/229 twice on a
non-crc xfs filesystem, or presumably on V5 with ikeep.
