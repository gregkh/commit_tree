riscv: add swiotlb support

All RISC-V platforms today lack an IOMMU. However, legacy PCI devices
sometimes require DMA-memory to be in the low 32 bits.  To make this work,
we enable the software-based bounce buffers from swiotlb.  They only impose
overhead when the device in question cannot address the full 64-bit address
space, so a perfect fit.

This patch assumes that DMA is coherent with the processor and the PCI
bus.  It also assumes that the processor and devices share a common
address space. This is true for all RISC-V platforms so far.

 more complicated swiotlb wireup before the recent consolidation]
