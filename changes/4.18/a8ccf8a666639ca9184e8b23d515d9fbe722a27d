PCI/IOV: Add pci-pf-stub driver for PFs that only enable VFs

Some SR-IOV PF devices provide no functionality other than acting as a
means of enabling VFs.  For these devices, we want to enable the VFs and
assign them to guest virtual machines, but there's no need to have a driver
for the PF itself.

Add a new pci-pf-stub driver to claim those PF devices and provide the
generic VF enable functionality.  An administrator can use the sysfs
"sriov_numvfs" file to enable VFs, then assign them to guests.

For now I only have one example ID provided by Amazon in terms of devices
that require this functionality.  The general idea is that in the future we
will see other devices added as vendors come up with devices where the PF
is more or less just a lightweight shim used to allocate VFs.
