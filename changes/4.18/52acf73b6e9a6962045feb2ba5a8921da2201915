hv_netvsc: Fix a network regression after ifdown/ifup

Recently people reported the NIC stops working after
"ifdown eth0; ifup eth0". It turns out in this case the TX queues are not
enabled, after the refactoring of the common detach logic: when the NIC
has sub-channels, usually we enable all the TX queues after all
sub-channels are set up: see rndis_set_subchannel() ->
netif_device_attach(), but in the case of "ifdown eth0; ifup eth0" where
the number of channels doesn't change, we also must make sure the TX queues
are enabled. The patch fixes the regression.
