drm/i915/icl: Enable 2nd DBuf slice only when needed

ICL has two slices of DBuf, each slice of size 1024 blocks.
We should not always enable slice-2. It should be enabled only if
display total required BW is > 12GBps OR more than 1 pipes are enabled.

Changes since V1:
 - typecast total_data_rate to u64 before multiplication to solve any
   possible overflow (Rodrigo)
 - fix where skl_wm_get_hw_state was memsetting ddb, resulting
   enabled_slices to become zero
 - Fix the logic of calculating ddb_size
Changes since V2:
 - If no-crtc is part of commit required_slices will have value "0",
   don't try to disable DBuf slice.
Changes since V3:
 - Create a generic helper to enable/disable slice
 - don't return early if total_data_rate is 0, it may be cursor only
   commit, or atomic modeset without any plane.
Changes since V4:
 - Solve checkpatch warnings
 - use kernel types u8/u64 instead of uint8_t/uint64_t
Changes since V5:
 - Rebase
