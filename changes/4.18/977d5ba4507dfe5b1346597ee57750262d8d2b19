soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Make PM domain initialization more robust

The quirk for R-Car E3 ES1.0 added in commit 086b399965a7ee7e ("soc:
renesas: r8a77990-sysc: Add workaround for 3DG-{A,B}") makes the 3DG-A
PM domain a subdomain of the 3DG-B PM domain.  However, registering
3DG-A with its parent fails silently, as the 3DG-B PM domain hasn't been
registered yet, and such failures are never reported.

Fix this by:
  1. Splitting PM Domain initialization in two steps, so all PM domains
     are registered before any child-parent links are established,
  2. Reporting any failures in establishing child-parent relations.

Check for and report pm_genpd_init() failures, too, as that function
gained a return value in commit 7eb231c337e00735 ("PM / Domains: Convert
pm_genpd_init() to return an error code").
