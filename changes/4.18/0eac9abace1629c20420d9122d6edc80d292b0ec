iwlwifi: mvm: fix TSO with highly fragmented SKBs

Our hardware has a limited amount of buffer descriptors
for each Tx packet. Because of that, there is a short
piece of code that makes sure that that we don't push too
many subframes in an A-MSDU because of subframes needs 2
buffer descriptors. This code also takes into account the
number of fragment of the skb since we also need a buffer
descriptor for each fragment in the skb.

This piece of code though didn't check that the resulting
number of subframes wasn't 0.

A user reported that using NFS client, he could get skbs
that are so fragmented that the code mentioned above
returned 0 for the number of subframes making
skb_gso_segment fail and subconsequently iwlwifi would WARN.

Fix this by make sure that num_subframes is at least 1.
