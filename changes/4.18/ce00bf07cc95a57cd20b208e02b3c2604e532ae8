netfilter: nf_log: don't hold nf_log_mutex during user access

The old code would indefinitely block other users of nf_log_mutex if
a userspace access in proc_dostring() blocked e.g. due to a userfaultfd
region. Fix it by moving proc_dostring() out of the locked region.

This is a followup to commit 266d07cb1c9a ("netfilter: nf_log: fix
sleeping function called from invalid context"), which changed this code
from using rcu_read_lock() to taking nf_log_mutex.
