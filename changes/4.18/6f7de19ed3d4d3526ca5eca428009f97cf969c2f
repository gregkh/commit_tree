btrfs: quota: Set rescan progress to (u64)-1 if we hit last leaf

Commit ff3d27a048d9 ("btrfs: qgroup: Finish rescan when hit the last leaf
of extent tree") added a new exit for rescan finish.

However after finishing quota rescan, we set
fs_info->qgroup_rescan_progress to (u64)-1 before we exit through the
original exit path.
While we missed that assignment of (u64)-1 in the new exit path.

The end result is, the quota status item doesn't have the same value.
(-1 vs the last bytenr + 1)
Although it doesn't affect quota accounting, it's still better to keep
the original behavior.
