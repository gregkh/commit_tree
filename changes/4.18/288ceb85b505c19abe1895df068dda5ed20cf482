ARM: dts: rockchip: set PWM delay backlight settings for Minnie

The minnie devices comes with an AUO B101EAN01 panel which is different
from default veyron devices, thus the power on/off timing sequence is
slightly different. The datasheet specifies a pwm delay of 200 ms, so
update the PMW delay proprieties accordingly.
