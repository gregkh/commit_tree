perf: riscv: preliminary RISC-V support

This patch provide a basic PMU, riscv_base_pmu, which supports two
general hardware event, instructions and cycles.  Furthermore, this
PMU serves as a reference implementation to ease the portings in
the future.

riscv_base_pmu should be able to run on any RISC-V machine that
conforms to the Priv-Spec.  Note that the latest qemu model hasn't
fully support a proper behavior of Priv-Spec 1.10 yet, but work
around should be easy with very small fixes.  Please check
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu/pull/115 for future updates.
