drm/amd/display: Fix DP HBR2 Eye Diagram Pattern on Carrizo

[why] dp hbr2 eye diagram pattern for raven asic is not stabled.
workaround is to use tp4 pattern. But this should not be
applied to asic before raven.

[how] add new bool varilable in asic caps. for raven asic,
use the workaround. for carrizo, vega, do not use workaround.
