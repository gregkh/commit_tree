drm/i915: Pack params to engine->schedule() into a struct

Today we only want to pass along the priority to engine->schedule(), but
in the future we want to have much more control over the various aspects
of the GPU during a context's execution, for example controlling the
frequency allowed. As we need an ever growing number of parameters for
scheduling, move those into a struct for convenience.

v2: Move the anonymous struct into its own function for legibility and
ye olde gcc.
