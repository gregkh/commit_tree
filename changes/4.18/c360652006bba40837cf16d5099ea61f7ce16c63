scsi: devinfo: BLIST_RETRY_ASC_C1 for Fujitsu ETERNUS

On Fujitsu ETERNUS systems, sense code ABORTED COMMAND with ASC/Q C1/01
is used to indicate temporary condition where the storage-internal path
to a target is switched from one controller to another. SCSI commands
that return with this error code must be retried unconditionally
(i.e. without the "maybe_retry" logic in scsi_decide_disposition);
otherwise dm-multipath might initiate a failover from a healthy path
e.g. for REQ_FAILFAST_DEV commands.

Introduce a new blist flag for this case.
