x86/mm: Unify pgtable_l5_enabled usage in early boot code

Usually pgtable_l5_enabled is defined using cpu_feature_enabled().
cpu_feature_enabled() is not available in early boot code. We use
several different preprocessor tricks to get around it. It's messy.

Unify them all.

If cpu_feature_enabled() is not yet available, USE_EARLY_PGTABLE_L5 can
be defined before all includes. It makes pgtable_l5_enabled rely on
__pgtable_l5_enabled variable instead. This approach fits all early
users.
