powerpc/pseries: lparcfg calculate PURR on demand

For SPLPAR, lparcfg provides a sum of PURR registers for all CPUs.
Currently this is done by reading PURR in context switch and timer
interrupt, and storing that into a per-CPU variable. These are summed
to provide the value.

This does not work with all timer schemes (e.g., NO_HZ_FULL), and it
is sub-optimal for performance because it reads the PURR register on
every context switch, although that's been difficult to distinguish
from noise in the contxt_switch microbenchmark.

This patch implements the sum by calling a function on each CPU, to
read and add PURR values of each CPU.
