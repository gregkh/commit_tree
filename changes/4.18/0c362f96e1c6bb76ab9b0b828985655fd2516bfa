signal: Stop special casing TRAP_FIXME and FPE_FIXME in siginfo_layout

After more experience with the cases where no one the si_code of 0
is used both as a signal specific si_code, and as SI_USER it appears
that no one cares about the signal specific si_code case and the
good solution is to just fix the architectures by using
a different si_code.

In none of the conversations has anyone even suggested that
anything depends on the signal specific redefinition of SI_USER.

There are at least test cases that care when si_code as 0 does
not work as si_user.

So make things simple and keep the generic code from introducing
problems by removing the special casing of TRAP_FIXME and FPE_FIXME.
This will ensure the generic case of sending a signal with
kill will always set SI_USER and work.

The architecture specific, and signal specific overloads that
set si_code to 0 will now have problems with signalfd and
the 32bit compat versions of siginfo copying.   At least
until they are fixed.
