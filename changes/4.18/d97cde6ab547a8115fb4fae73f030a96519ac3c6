hv_netvsc: fix bogus ifalias on network device

If the guest network adapter is not configured with DeviceNaming
enabled on the host, then the query for friendly name will return
success but with a zero length name. Which then leads to a garbage value
(stack contents) for ifalias.

Fix is simple, just don't set name if  host doesn't return it.
