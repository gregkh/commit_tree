fscrypt: only derive the needed portion of the key

Currently the key derivation function in fscrypt uses the master key
length as the amount of output key material to derive.  This works, but
it means we can waste time deriving more key material than is actually
used, e.g. most commonly, deriving 64 bytes for directories which only
take a 32-byte AES-256-CTS-CBC key.  It also forces us to validate that
the master key length is a multiple of AES_BLOCK_SIZE, which wouldn't
otherwise be necessary.

Fix it to only derive the needed length key.
