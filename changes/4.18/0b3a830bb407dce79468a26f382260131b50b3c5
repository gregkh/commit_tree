crypto: ccp - Add GET_ID SEV command

The GET_ID command, added as of SEV API v0.16, allows the SEV firmware
to be queried about a unique CPU ID. This unique ID can then be used
to obtain the public certificate containing the Chip Endorsement Key
(CEK) public key signed by the AMD SEV Signing Key (ASK).

For more information please refer to "Section 5.12 GET_ID" of
https://support.amd.com/TechDocs/55766_SEV-KM%20API_Specification.pdf
