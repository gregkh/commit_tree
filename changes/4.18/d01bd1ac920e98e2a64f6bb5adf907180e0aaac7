perf config: Call perf_config__init() lazily

We check what perf_config__init() does at each perf_config() call,
namely if the static perf_config instance was created, so instead of
bailing out in that case, try to allocate it, bailing if it fails.

Now to get the perf_config() call out of the start of perf's main()
function, doing it also lazily.
