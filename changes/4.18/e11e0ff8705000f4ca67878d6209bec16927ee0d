scsi: cxlflash: Preserve number of interrupts for master contexts

The number of interrupts requested for user contexts are stored in the context
specific structures and utilized to manage the interrupts. For the master
contexts, this number is only used once and therefore not saved.

To prepare for future commits where the number of interrupts will be required
in more than one place, preserve the value in the master context structure.
