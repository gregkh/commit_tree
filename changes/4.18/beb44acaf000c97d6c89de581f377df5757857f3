seccomp: Configurable separator for the actions_logged string

The function that converts a bitmask of seccomp actions that are
allowed to be logged is currently only used for constructing the display
string for the kernel.seccomp.actions_logged sysctl. That string wants a
space character to be used for the separator between actions.

A future patch will make use of the same function for building a string
that will be sent to the audit subsystem for tracking modifications to
the kernel.seccomp.actions_logged sysctl. That string will need to use a
comma as a separator. This patch allows the separator character to be
configurable to meet both needs.
