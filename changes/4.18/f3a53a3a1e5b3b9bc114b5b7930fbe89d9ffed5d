mm, memcontrol: implement memory.swap.events

Add swap max and fail events so that userland can monitor and respond to
running out of swap.

I'm not too sure about the fail event.  Right now, it's a bit confusing
which stats / events are recursive and which aren't and also which ones
reflect events which originate from a given cgroup and which targets the
cgroup.  No idea what the right long term solution is and it could just
be that growing them organically is actually the only right thing to do.
