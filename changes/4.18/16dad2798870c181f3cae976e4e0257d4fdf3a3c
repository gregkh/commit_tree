scsi: zfcp: enhance comments on fc_link_speed and supported_speed

The comment on fsf_qtcb_bottom_port.supported_speed did read as if the field
can only assume one of two possible values (i.e. 0x1 for 1 GBit/s or 0x2 for
2 GBit/s). This is not true for two reasons: first it is a flag field and
can thus assume any combination and second there are meanwhile more speeds.

Clarify comment on fsf_qtcb_bottom_port.supported_speed and add a comment to
fsf_qtcb_bottom_config.fc_link_speed.
