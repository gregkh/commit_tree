drivers: remove force dma flag from buses

With each bus implementing its own DMA configuration callback, there is no
need for bus to explicitly set the force_dma flag.  Modify the
of_dma_configure function to accept an input parameter which specifies if
implicit DMA configuration is required when it is not described by the
firmware.
