drm/i915/uc: Sanitize uC options early

We are sanitizing uC related modparams together with other driver
modparams in intel_sanitize_options called from i915_driver_init_hw,
but this is too late for us as we will want to use USES_GUC/USES_HUC
macros at earlier stage. Since our sanitizing does not require any
MMIO access, we can do it in intel_uc_init_early right after we resolve
firmware names.
