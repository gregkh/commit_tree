net: fix use-after-free in GRO with ESP

Since the addition of GRO for ESP, gro_receive can consume the skb and
return -EINPROGRESS. In that case, the lower layer GRO handler cannot
touch the skb anymore.

Commit 5f114163f2f5 ("net: Add a skb_gro_flush_final helper.") converted
some of the gro_receive handlers that can lead to ESP's gro_receive so
that they wouldn't access the skb when -EINPROGRESS is returned, but
missed other spots, mainly in tunneling protocols.

This patch finishes the conversion to using skb_gro_flush_final(), and
adds a new helper, skb_gro_flush_final_remcsum(), used in VXLAN and
GUE.
