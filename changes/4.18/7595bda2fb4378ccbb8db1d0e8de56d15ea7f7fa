drm: Add DRM client cap for aspect-ratio

To enable aspect-ratio support in DRM, blindly exposing the aspect
ratio information along with mode, can break things in existing
non-atomic user-spaces which have no intention or support to use this
aspect ratio information.

To avoid this, a new drm client cap is required to enable a non-atomic
user-space to advertise if it supports modes with aspect-ratio. Based
on this cap value, the kernel will take a call on exposing the aspect
ratio info in modes or not.

This patch adds the client cap for aspect-ratio.

Since no atomic-userspaces blow up on receiving aspect-ratio
information, the client cap for aspect-ratio is always enabled
for atomic clients.

V3: rebase
V4: As suggested by Marteen Lankhorst modified the commit message
    explaining the need to use the DRM cap for aspect-ratio. Also,
    tweaked the comment lines in the code for better understanding and
    clarity, as recommended by Shashank Sharma.
