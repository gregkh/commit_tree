ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Use device properties for setting up dmic

Use device-properties for setting up the dmic, based on the
BYT_RT5640_MAP() value, instead of using the codec specific
rt5640_dmic_enable() function for this.  This also removes the need
for the BYT_RT5640_DMIC_EN quirk, which was always set together with
a MAP() quirk of DMIC1_MAP or DMIC2_MAP.
