drm/gem: Document that handle_create must be the last step

It published the gem object to userspace, by that point other threads
can guess the id and start using it. And gem IDs are _very_ easy to
guess (it's just an idr).

Since gem objects is the only thing we allow drivers to create
themselves (all the kms/prime/syncobj stuff is handled by the core) no
other functions seem to be in need of this clarification.

Motivated by reviewing the xen-front kms driver.
