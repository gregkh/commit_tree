can: xilinx_can: fix recovery from error states not being propagated

The xilinx_can driver contains no mechanism for propagating recovery
from CAN_STATE_ERROR_WARNING and CAN_STATE_ERROR_PASSIVE.

Add such a mechanism by factoring the handling of
XCAN_STATE_ERROR_PASSIVE and XCAN_STATE_ERROR_WARNING out of
xcan_err_interrupt and checking for recovery after RX and TX if the
interface is in one of those states.

Tested with the integrated CAN on Zynq-7000 SoC.
