RDMA/mlx4: Catch FW<->SW misalignment without machine crash

Any steering QP is supposed be above steering_qp_base,
see function mlx4_ib_steer_qp_alloc() for it, however in case
of misalignment between SW and FW, this qp_base can be wrong.

Use WARN() to catch such situation without killing the machine.
