drm/i915/gtt: Trust the uncached store to flush wcb

Not all architectures guarantee that uncached read will
flush the write combining buffer. So marking it explicitly
is recommended [1].

However we know the architecture we are operating on
and can avoid wmb as the UC store will flush the wcb [2].

Omit the wmb() before invalidate as redudant.

v2: squash combining and removal (Chris)
v3: remove obsolete comments about posting reads (Chris)
