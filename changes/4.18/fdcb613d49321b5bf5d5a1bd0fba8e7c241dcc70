ACPI / LPSS: Add missing prv_offset setting for byt/cht PWM devices

The LPSS PWM device on on Bay Trail and Cherry Trail devices has a set
of private registers at offset 0x800, the current lpss_device_desc for
them already sets the LPSS_SAVE_CTX flag to have these saved/restored
over device-suspend, but the current lpss_device_desc was not setting
the prv_offset field, leading to the regular device registers getting
saved/restored instead.

This is causing the PWM controller to no longer work, resulting in a black
screen,  after a suspend/resume on systems where the firmware clears the
APB clock and reset bits at offset 0x804.

This commit fixes this by properly setting prv_offset to 0x800 for
the PWM devices.
