staging: lustre: lu_object: move retry logic inside htable_lookup

The current retry logic, to wait when a 'dying' object is found,
spans multiple functions.  The process is attached to a waitqueue
and set TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE in htable_lookup, and this status
is passed back through lu_object_find_try() to lu_object_find_at()
where schedule() is called and the process is removed from the queue.

This can be simplified by moving all the logic (including
hashtable locking) inside htable_lookup(), which now never returns
EAGAIN.

Note that htable_lookup() is called with the hash bucket lock
held, and will drop and retake it if it needs to schedule.

I made this a 'goto' loop rather than a 'while(1)' loop as the
diff is easier to read.
