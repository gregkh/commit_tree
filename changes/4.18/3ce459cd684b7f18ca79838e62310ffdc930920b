IB/{rdmavt,hfi1}: Change hrtimer add to use pinned version

Given we are dealing with nano-second level timers, when the timer
pops, ensure it happens on the CPU which caused the timer to be set
in the first place.  This avoids excessive jitter from the desired
expiration time by avoiding the cost of switching our context to
another CPU that is cache cold for this given timer.
