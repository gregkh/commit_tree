cgroup: Add memory barriers to plug cgroup_rstat_updated() race window

cgroup_rstat_updated() has a small race window where an updated
signaling can race with flush and could be lost till the next update.
This wasn't a problem for the existing usages, but we plan to use
rstat to track counters which need to be accurate.

This patch plugs the race window by synchronizing
cgroup_rstat_updated() and flush path with memory barriers around
cgroup_rstat_cpu->updated_next pointer.
