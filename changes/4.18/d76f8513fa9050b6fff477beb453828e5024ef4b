rsi: reset hibernate_resume flag to work hibernate resume in coex mode.

In coex mode, observed hibernate resume is not working properly, as the
hibernate_resume flag is not getting reset in rsi_coex_recv_pkt(),
when common card ready indication received from firmware. Hence resetting
hibernate_resume flag in this function.
