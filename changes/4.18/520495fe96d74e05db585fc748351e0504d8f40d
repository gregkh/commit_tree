mm: hugetlb: yield when prepping struct pages

When booting with very large numbers of gigantic (i.e.  1G) pages, the
operations in the loop of gather_bootmem_prealloc, and specifically
prep_compound_gigantic_page, takes a very long time, and can cause a
softlockup if enough pages are requested at boot.

For example booting with 3844 1G pages requires prepping
(set_compound_head, init the count) over 1 billion 4K tail pages, which
takes considerable time.

Add a cond_resched() to the outer loop in gather_bootmem_prealloc() to
prevent this lockup.

Tested: Booted with softlockup_panic=1 hugepagesz=1G hugepages=3844 and
no softlockup is reported, and the hugepages are reported as
successfully setup.
