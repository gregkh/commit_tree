neighbour: skip NTF_EXT_LEARNED entries during forced gc

Commit 9ce33e46531d ("neighbour: support for NTF_EXT_LEARNED flag")
added support for NTF_EXT_LEARNED for neighbour entries.
NTF_EXT_LEARNED entries are neigh entries managed by control
plane (eg: Ethernet VPN implementation in FRR routing suite).
Periodic gc already excludes these entries. This patch extends
it to forced gc which the earlier patch missed.
