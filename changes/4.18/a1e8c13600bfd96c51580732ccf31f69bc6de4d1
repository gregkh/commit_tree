PM / OPP: "opp-hz" is optional for power domains

"opp-hz" property is optional for power domains now and we shouldn't
error out if it is missing for power domains.

This patch creates two new routines, _get_opp_count() and
_opp_is_duplicate(), by separating existing code from their parent
functions. Also skip duplicate OPP check for power domain OPPs as they
may not have any the "opp-hz" field, but a platform specific performance
state binding to uniquely identify OPP nodes.

By default the debugfs OPP nodes are named using the "rate" value, but
that isn't possible for the power domain OPP nodes and hence they use
the index of the OPP node in the OPP node list instead.
