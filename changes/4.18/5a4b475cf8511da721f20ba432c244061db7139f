powerpc/powermac: Mark variable x as unused

Since the value of x is never intended to be read, declare it with gcc
attribute as unused. Fix warning treated as error with W=1:

  arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/bootx_init.c:471:21: error: variable ‘x’ set but not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]
