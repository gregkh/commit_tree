Btrfs: clean up error handling in btrfs_truncate()

btrfs_truncate() uses two variables for error handling, ret and err (if
this sounds familiar, it's because btrfs_truncate_inode_items() did
something similar). This is error prone, as was made evident by "Btrfs:
fix error handling in btrfs_truncate()". We only have err because we
don't want to mask an error if we call btrfs_update_inode() and
btrfs_end_transaction(), so let's make that its own scoped return
variable and use ret everywhere else.
