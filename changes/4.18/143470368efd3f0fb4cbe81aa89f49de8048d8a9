usb: tegra: Move utmi-pads reset from ehci-tegra to tegra-phy

UTMI pads are shared by USB controllers and reset of UTMI pads is shared
with the reset of USB1 controller. Currently reset of UTMI pads is done by
the EHCI driver and ChipIdea UDC works because EHCI driver always happen
to be probed first. Move reset controls from ehci-tegra to tegra-phy in
order to resolve the problem.
