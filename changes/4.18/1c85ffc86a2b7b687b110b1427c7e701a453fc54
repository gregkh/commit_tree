dt-bindings: watchdog: renesas-wdt: Add R-Car Gen2 support

This commit documents the compatibility with R-Car Gen2 and RZ/G
devices by defining the generic compatible string "renesas,rcar-gen2-wdt".
Also, this patch expands the list of SoC-specific compatible strings to
include RZ/G and R-Car Gen2 devices.
