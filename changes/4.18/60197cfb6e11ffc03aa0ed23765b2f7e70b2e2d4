bpf: btf: Add BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD support to BTF fd

This patch adds BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD support to BTF fd.
The original BTF data, which was used to create the BTF fd during
the earlier BPF_BTF_LOAD call, will be returned.

The userspace is expected to allocate buffer
to info.info and the buffer size is set to info.info_len before
calling BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD.

The original BTF data is copied to the userspace buffer (info.info).
Only upto the user's specified info.info_len will be copied.

The original BTF data size is set to info.info_len.  The userspace
needs to check if it is bigger than its allocated buffer size.
If it is, the userspace should realloc with the kernel-returned
info.info_len and call the BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD again.
