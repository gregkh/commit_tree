tcp: simpler NewReno implementation

This is a rewrite of NewReno loss recovery implementation that is
simpler and standalone for readability and better performance by
using less states.

Note that NewReno refers to RFC6582 as a modification to the fast
recovery algorithm. It is used only if the connection does not
support SACK in Linux. It should not to be confused with the Reno
(AIMD) congestion control.
