drm/i915/cnl; Add macro to get PORT_TX register

This patch creates a new macro to get PORT_TX register for any given DW.
This removes the need of defining register address for each port & DW.

Changes since V1:
 - Use underscope prefix, as macro isn't returning an mmio reg(Lucas)
 - Merge patch 1 & 2 of the series
Changes since V2:
 - remove _MMIO_PORT6_LN macro (Rodrigo)
