drm/i915: Build request info on stack before printk

printk unhelpfully inserts a '\n' between consecutive calls, and since
our drm_printf wrapper may be emitting info a seq_file instead,
KERN_CONT is not an option. To work with any drm_printf destination, we
need to build up the output into a temporary buf on the stack and then
feed the complete line in a single call to printk.
