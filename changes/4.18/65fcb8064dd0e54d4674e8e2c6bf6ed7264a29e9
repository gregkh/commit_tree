drm/i915: Move timeline from GTT to ring

In the future, we want to move a request between engines. To achieve
this, we first realise that we have two timelines in effect here. The
first runs through the GTT is required for ordering vma access, which is
tracked currently by engine. The second is implied by sequential
execution of commands inside the ringbuffer. This timeline is one that
maps to userspace's expectations when submitting requests (i.e. given the
same context, batch A is executed before batch B). As the rings's
timelines map to userspace and the GTT timeline an implementation
detail, move the timeline from the GTT into the ring itself (per-context
in logical-ring-contexts/execlists, or a global per-engine timeline for
the shared ringbuffers in legacy submission.

The two timelines are still assumed to be equivalent at the moment (no
migrating requests between engines yet) and so we can simply move from
one to the other without adding extra ordering.

v2: Reinforce that one isn't allowed to mix the engine execution
timeline with the client timeline from userspace (on the ring).
