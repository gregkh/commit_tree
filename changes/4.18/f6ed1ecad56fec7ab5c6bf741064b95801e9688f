signal/nds32: Use force_sig(SIGILL) in do_revisn

As originally committed do_revisn would deliver a siginfo for SIGILL
with an si_code composed of random stack contents.  That makes no
sense and is not something userspace can depend on.  So simplify
the code and just use "force_sig(SIG_ILL, current)" instead.
