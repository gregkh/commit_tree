scsi: zfcp: decouple SCSI traces for scsi_eh / TMF from scsi_cmnd

The SCSI command pointer passed to scsi_eh callbacks is just one arbitrary
command of potentially many that are in the eh queue to be processed.  The
command is only used to indirectly pass the TMF scope in terms of SCSI
ID/target and SCSI LUN for LUN reset.

Hence, zfcp had filled in SCSI trace record fields which do not really
belong to the TMF. This was confusing.

Therefore, refactor the TMF tracing to work without SCSI command.  Since the
FCP channel always requires a valid LUN handle, we use SCSI device as common
context for any TMF (even target reset).  To make it even clearer, we set
all bits to 1 for the fields, which do not belong to the TMF, to indicate
that these fields are invalid.

The old zfcp_dbf_scsi() became zfcp_dbf_scsi_common() to now handle both
SCSI commands and TMFs. The old argument scsi_cmnd is now optional and can
be NULL with TMFs. The new argument scsi_device is mandatory to carry
context, as well as SCSI ID/target and SCSI LUN in case of TMFs.

New example trace record formatted with zfcpdbf from s390-tools:

Timestamp      : ...

Subarea        : 00

                 For cases without FSF request: 0x0 for none (invalid)
SCSI ID        : 0x<scsi_id>            SCSI ID/target denoting scope
