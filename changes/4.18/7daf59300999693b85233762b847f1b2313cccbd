powerpc/xmon: Also setup debugger hooks when single-stepping

When single-stepping kernel code from xmon without a debug hook
enabled the kernel crashes. This can happen when kernel starts with
xmon on crash disabled but xmon is entered using sysrq.

Call force_enable_xmon when single-stepping in xmon to install the
xmon debug hooks.
