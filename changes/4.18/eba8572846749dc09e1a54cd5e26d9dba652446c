staging: lustre: remove include/linux/libcfs/linux/linux-cpu.h

This include file contains definitions used when CONFIG_SMP
is in effect.  Other includes contain corresponding definitions
for when it isn't.
This can be hard to follow, so move the definitions to the one place.

As HAVE_LIBCFS_CPT is defined precisely when CONFIG_SMP, we discard
that macro and just use CONFIG_SMP when needed.
