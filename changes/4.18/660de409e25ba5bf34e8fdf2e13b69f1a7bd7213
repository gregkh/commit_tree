ipconfig: Document setting of NIS domain name

ic_do_bootp_ext() is responsible for parsing the "ip=" and "nfsaddrs="
kernel parameters. If a "." character is found in parameter 4 (the
client's hostname), everything before the first "." is used as the
hostname, and everything after it is used as the NIS domain name (but
not necessarily the DNS domain name).

Document this behaviour in Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt,
as it is not made explicit.
