xfs: fix xfs_rtalloc_rec units

All the realtime allocation functions deal with space on the rtdev in
units of realtime extents.  However, struct xfs_rtalloc_rec confusingly
uses the word 'block' in the name, even though they're really extents.

Fix the naming problem and fix all the unit handling problems in the two
existing users.
