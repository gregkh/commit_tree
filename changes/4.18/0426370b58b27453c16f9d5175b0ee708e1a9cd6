ARM: dts: omap2420-n810: Correct the audio codec (tlv320aic33) node

- The n810 uses tlv320aic33 codec.
- GPIO118 is used as reset GPIO for the codec, which was missing.
- The MCLK of the codec is connected to the SYS_CLKOUT2 of omap2420. The
  SYS_CLKOUT2 needs to be running at 12MHz.
- Add the pinctrl entries to configure the pins for GPIO118 and SYS_CLKOUT2
- Set DMIC clk mode for GPIO1
- Set DMIC data in for GPIO2
- Select 2V for the DMIC bias
- Add fixed regulators for the codec
