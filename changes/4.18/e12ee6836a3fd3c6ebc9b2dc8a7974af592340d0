fscrypt: make fscrypt_operations.max_namelen an integer

Now ->max_namelen() is only called to limit the filename length when
adding NUL padding, and only for real filenames -- not symlink targets.
It also didn't give the correct length for symlink targets anyway since
it forgot to subtract 'sizeof(struct fscrypt_symlink_data)'.

Thus, change ->max_namelen from a function to a simple 'unsigned int'
that gives the filesystem's maximum filename length.
