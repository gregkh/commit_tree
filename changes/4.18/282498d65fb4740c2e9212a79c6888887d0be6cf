powerpc/xive: prepare all hcalls to support long busy delays

This is not the case for the moment, but future releases of pHyp might
need to introduce some synchronisation routines under the hood which
would make the XIVE hcalls longer to complete.

As this was done for H_INT_RESET, let's wrap the other hcalls in a
loop catching the H_LONG_BUSY_* codes.
