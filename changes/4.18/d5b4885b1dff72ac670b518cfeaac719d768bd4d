ARM64: dts: meson: disable sd-uhs modes on the libretech-cc

There is a problem with the sd-uhs mode when doing a soft reboot.
Switching back from 1.8v to 3.3v messes with the card, which no longer
respond (timeout errors). According to the specification, we should
perform a card reset (power cycling the card) but this is something we
cannot control on this design.

Then the only solution to restore the communication with the card is an
"unplug-plug" which is not acceptable

Until we find a solution, if any, disable the sd-uhs modes on this design.
For the people using uhs at the moment, there will a performance drop as
a result.
