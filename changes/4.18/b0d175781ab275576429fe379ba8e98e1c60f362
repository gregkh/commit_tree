y2038: ipc: Enable COMPAT_32BIT_TIME

Three ipc syscalls (mq_timedsend, mq_timedreceive and and semtimedop)
take a timespec argument. After we move 32-bit architectures over to
useing 64-bit time_t based syscalls, we need seperate entry points for
the old 32-bit based interfaces.

This changes the #ifdef guards for the existing 32-bit compat syscalls
to check for CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME instead, which will then be
enabled on all existing 32-bit architectures.
