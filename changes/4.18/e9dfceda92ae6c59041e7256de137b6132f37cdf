scsi: cxlflash: Read host function configuration

Per the OCXL specification, the underlying host can have multiple AFUs per
function with each function supporting its own configuration. The host
function configuration is read on the initialization path to evaluate the
number of functions present and identify the features and configuration of the
functions present. This data is cached for use in later configuration
steps. Note that for the OCXL hardware supported by the cxlflash driver, only
one AFU per function is expected.
