samples: bpf: rename struct bpf_map_def to avoid conflict with libbpf

Both tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.h and samples/bpf/bpf_load.h define their
own version of struct bpf_map_def.  The version in bpf_load.h has
more fields.  libbpf does not support inner maps and its definition
of struct bpf_map_def lacks the related fields.  Rename the definition
in bpf_load.h (samples/bpf) to avoid conflicts.
