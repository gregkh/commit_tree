kvmclock: fix TSC calibration for nested guests

Inside a nested guest, access to hardware can be slow enough that
tsc_read_refs always return ULLONG_MAX, causing tsc_refine_calibration_work
to be called periodically and the nested guest to spend a lot of time
reading the ACPI timer.

However, if the TSC frequency is available from the pvclock page,
we can just set X86_FEATURE_TSC_KNOWN_FREQ and avoid the recalibration.
'refine' operation.
