big key: get rid of stack array allocation

We're interested in getting rid of all of the stack allocated arrays in the
kernel [1]. This patch simply hardcodes the iv length to match that of the
hardcoded cipher.

v2: hardcode the length of the nonce to be the GCM AES IV length, and do a
    sanity check in init(), Eric Biggers
v3: * remember to free big_key_aead when sanity check fails
    * define a constant for big key IV size so it can be changed along side
      the algorithm in the code
