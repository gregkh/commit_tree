ext4: only look at the bg_flags field if it is valid

The bg_flags field in the block group descripts is only valid if the
uninit_bg or metadata_csum feature is enabled.  We were not
consistently looking at this field; fix this.

Also block group #0 must never have uninitialized allocation bitmaps,
or need to be zeroed, since that's where the root inode, and other
special inodes are set up.  Check for these conditions and mark the
file system as corrupted if they are detected.

This addresses CVE-2018-10876.
