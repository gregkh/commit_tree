spi: bcm-qspi: Implement the spi_mem interface

The spi_mem interface is meant to replace the ->spi_flash_read() one.
Implement the ->exec_op() method to ease removal of the old interface.

Not that ->spi_flash_read() is now implemented as a wrapper around the
new bcm_qspi_exec_mem_op() function so that we can easily get rid of
it when ->spi_flash_read() is removed.
