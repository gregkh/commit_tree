bpf: avoid -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

The stack_map_get_build_id_offset() function is too long for gcc to track
whether 'work' may or may not be initialized at the end of it, leading
to a false-positive warning:

kernel/bpf/stackmap.c: In function 'stack_map_get_build_id_offset':
kernel/bpf/stackmap.c:334:13: error: 'work' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This removes the 'in_nmi_ctx' flag and uses the state of that variable
itself to see if it got initialized.
