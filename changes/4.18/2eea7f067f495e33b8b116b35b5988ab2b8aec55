powerpc/64s: Add support for ori barrier_nospec patching

Based on the RFI patching. This is required to be able to disable the
speculation barrier.

Only one barrier type is supported and it does nothing when the
firmware does not enable it. Also re-patching modules is not supported
So the only meaningful thing that can be done is patching out the
speculation barrier at boot when the user says it is not wanted.
