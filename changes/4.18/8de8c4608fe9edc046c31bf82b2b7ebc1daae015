cifs: Fix validation of signed data in smb2

Fixes: c713c8770fa5 ("cifs: push rfc1002 generation down the stack")

We failed to validate signed data returned by the server because
__cifs_calc_signature() now expects to sign the actual data in iov but
we were also passing down the rfc1002 length.

Fix smb3_calc_signature() to calculate signature of rfc1002 length prior
to passing only the actual data iov[1-N] to __cifs_calc_signature(). In
addition, there are a few cases where no rfc1002 length is passed so we
make sure there's one (iov_len == 4).
