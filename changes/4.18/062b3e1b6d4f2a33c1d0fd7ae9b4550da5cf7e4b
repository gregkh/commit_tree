net/ncsi: Refactor MAC, VLAN filters

The NCSI driver defines a generic ncsi_channel_filter struct that can be
used to store arbitrarily formatted filters, and several generic methods
of accessing data stored in such a filter.
However in both the driver and as defined in the NCSI specification
there are only two actual filters: VLAN ID filters and MAC address
filters. The splitting of the MAC filter into unicast, multicast, and
mixed is also technically not necessary as these are stored in the same
location in hardware.

To save complexity, particularly in the set up and accessing of these
generic filters, remove them in favour of two specific structs. These
can be acted on directly and do not need several generic helper
functions to use.

This also fixes a memory error found by KASAN on ARM32 (which is not
upstream yet), where response handlers accessing a filter's data field
could write past allocated memory.
