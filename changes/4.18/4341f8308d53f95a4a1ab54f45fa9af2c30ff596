net: remove bypassed check in sch_direct_xmit()

Checking netif_xmit_frozen_or_stopped() at the end of sch_direct_xmit()
is being bypassed. This is because "ret" from sch_direct_xmit() will be
either NETDEV_TX_OK or NETDEV_TX_BUSY, and only ret == NETDEV_TX_OK == 0
will reach the condition:

    if (ret && netif_xmit_frozen_or_stopped(txq))
        return false;

This patch cleans up the code by removing the whole condition.
