ASoC: pxa-ssp: allow more flexible setup order

The pxa-ssp driver currently assumes that .set_fmt() is called before
.set_clkdiv(), .set_pll() etc.

Commit a8bd0ee558714 ("ASoC: raumfeld: Use static DAI format setup") broke
support for Raumfeld hardware (and possible other PXA based ones) because
it effectively changed the order of these calls. Also, as the call to
.set_fmt() is now done at probe time, the port clock is not yet enabled.

To fix this, strip all hardware register access code from the .set_fmt()
callback and memorize the desired value, so we can use it from the
.hw_params() callback. Also make the .set_fmt() callback less destructive
by reading all registers that it writes to in the beginning and only
masking out the bits that it possibly fiddles with.
