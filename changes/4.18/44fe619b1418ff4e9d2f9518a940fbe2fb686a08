perf tools: Fix the build on the alpine:edge distro

The UAPI file byteorder/little_endian.h uses the __always_inline define
without including the header where it is defined, linux/stddef.h, this
ends up working in all the other distros because that file gets included
seemingly by luck from one of the files included from little_endian.h.

But not on Alpine:edge, that fails for all files where perf_event.h is
included but linux/stddef.h isn't include before that.

Adding the missing linux/stddef.h file where it breaks on Alpine:edge to
fix that, in all other distros, that is just a very small header anyway.
