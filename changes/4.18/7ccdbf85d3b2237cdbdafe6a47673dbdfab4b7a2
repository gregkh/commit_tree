dm thin metadata: remove needless work from __commit_transaction

Commit 5a32083d03fb5 ("dm: take care to copy the space map roots before
locking the superblock") properly removed the calls to dm_sm_root_size()
from __write_initial_superblock().  But the dm_sm_root_size() calls were
left dangling in __commit_transaction().
