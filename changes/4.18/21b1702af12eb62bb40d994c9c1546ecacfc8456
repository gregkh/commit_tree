s390/qeth: improve fallback to random MAC address

If READ MAC fails to fetch a valid MAC address, allow some more device
types (IQD and z/VM OSD) to fall back to a random address.
Also use eth_hw_addr_random(), for indicating to userspace that the
address type is NET_ADDR_RANDOM.

Note that while z/VM has various protection schemes to prohibit
custom addresses on its NICs, they are all optional. So we should at
least give it a try.
