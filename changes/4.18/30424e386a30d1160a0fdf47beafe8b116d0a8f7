powerpc/eeh: Clean up pci_ers_result handling

As EEH event handling progresses, a cumulative result of type
pci_ers_result is built up by (some of) the eeh_report_*() functions
using either:
	if (rc == PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET) *res = rc;
	if (*res == PCI_ERS_RESULT_NONE) *res = rc;
or:
	if ((*res == PCI_ERS_RESULT_NONE) ||
	    (*res == PCI_ERS_RESULT_RECOVERED)) *res = rc;
	if (*res == PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT &&
	    rc == PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET) *res = rc;
(Where *res is the accumulator.)

However, the intent is not immediately clear and the result in some
situations is order dependent.

Address this by assigning a priority to each result value, and always
merging to the highest priority. This renders the intent clear, and
provides a stable value for all orderings.
