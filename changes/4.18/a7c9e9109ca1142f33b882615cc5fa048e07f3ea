lightnvm: pass flag on graceful teardown to targets

If the namespace is unregistered before the LightNVM target is removed
(e.g., on hot unplug) it is too late for the target to store any metadata
on the device - any attempt to write to the device will fail. In this
case, pass on a "gracefull teardown" flag to the target to let it know
when this happens.

In the case of pblk, we pad the open line (close all open chunks) to
improve data retention. In the event of an ungraceful shutdown, avoid
this part and just clean up.
