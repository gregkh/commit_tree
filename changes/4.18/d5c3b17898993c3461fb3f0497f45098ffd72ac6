crypto: ecc - Actually remove stack VLA usage

On the quest to remove all VLAs from the kernel[1], this avoids VLAs
by just using the maximum allocation size (4 bytes) for stack arrays.
All the VLAs in ecc were either 3 or 4 bytes (or a multiple), so just
make it 4 bytes all the time. Initialization routines are adjusted to
check that ndigits does not end up larger than the arrays.

This includes a removal of the earlier attempt at this fix from
commit a963834b4742 ("crypto/ecc: Remove stack VLA usage")
