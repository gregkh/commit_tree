net/mlx5: E-Switch, Avoid setup attempt if not being e-switch manager

In smartnic env, the host (PF) driver might not be an e-switch
manager, hence the FW will err on driver attempts to deal with
setting/unsetting the eswitch and as a result the overall setup
of sriov will fail.

Fix that by avoiding the operation if e-switch management is not
allowed for this driver instance. While here, move to use the
correct name for the esw manager capability name.
