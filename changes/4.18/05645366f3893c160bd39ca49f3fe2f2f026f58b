usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix list_del corruption in dwc3_ep_dequeue

dwc3_ep_dequeue() waits for completion of End Transfer command using
wait_event_lock_irq(), which will release the dwc3->lock while waiting
and reacquire after completion. This allows a potential race condition
with ep_disable() which also removes all requests from started_list
and pending_list.

The check for NULL r->trb should catch this but currently it exits to
the wrong 'out1' label which calls dwc3_gadget_giveback(). Since its
list entry was already removed, if CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled a
'list_del corruption' bug is thrown since its next/prev pointers are
already LIST_POISON1/2. If r->trb is NULL it should simply exit to
'out0'.
