crypto: testmgr - remove bfin_crc "hmac(crc32)" test vectors

The Blackfin CRC driver was removed by commit 9678a8dc53c1 ("crypto:
bfin_crc - remove blackfin CRC driver"), but it was forgotten to remove
the corresponding "hmac(crc32)" test vectors.  I see no point in keeping
them since nothing else appears to implement or use "hmac(crc32)", which
isn't an algorithm that makes sense anyway because HMAC is meant to be
used with a cryptographically secure hash function, which CRC's are not.

Thus, remove the unneeded test vectors.
