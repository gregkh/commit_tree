net/ipv6: Extract table lookup from ip6_pol_route

ip6_pol_route is used for ingress and egress FIB lookups. Refactor it
moving the table lookup into a separate fib6_table_lookup that can be
invoked separately and export the new function.

ip6_pol_route now calls fib6_table_lookup and uses the result to generate
a dst based rt6_info.
