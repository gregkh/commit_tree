selinux: move user accesses in selinuxfs out of locked regions

If a user is accessing a file in selinuxfs with a pointer to a userspace
buffer that is backed by e.g. a userfaultfd, the userspace access can
stall indefinitely, which can block fsi->mutex if it is held.

For sel_read_policy(), remove the locking, since this method doesn't seem
to access anything that requires locking.

For sel_read_bool(), move the user access below the locked region.

For sel_write_bool() and sel_commit_bools_write(), move the user access
up above the locked region.
