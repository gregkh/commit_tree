dt-bindings: clock: imx6ul: Do not change the clock definition order

Commit f5a4670de966 ("clk: imx: Add new clo01 and clo2 controlled
by CCOSR") introduced the CLK_CLKO definitions, but didn't put them
at the end of the list, which may cause dtb breakage when running an old
dtb with a newer kernel.

In order to avoid that, simply add the new CLK_CKO clock definitions
at the end of the list.
