Revert "tick: Prefer a lower rating device only if it's CPU local device"

This reverts commit 1332a90558013ae4242e3dd7934bdcdeafb06c0d.

The original issue was not because of incorrect checking of cpumask for
both new and old tick device. It was incorrectly analysed was due to the
misunderstanding of the comment and misinterpretation of the return value
from tick_check_preferred. The main issue is with the clockevent driver
that sets the cpumask to cpu_all_mask instead of cpu_possible_mask.
