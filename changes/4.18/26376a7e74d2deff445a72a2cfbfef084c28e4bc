drm/i915/icl: Check for fused-off VDBOX and VEBOX instances

In Gen11, the Video Decode engines (aka VDBOX, aka VCS, aka BSD) and the
Video Enhancement engines (aka VEBOX, aka VECS) could be fused off. Also,
each VDBOX and VEBOX has its own power well, which only exist if the
related engine exists in the HW.

Unfortunately, we have a Catch-22 situation going on: we need the blitter
forcewake to read the register with the fuse info, but we cannot initialize
the forcewake domains without knowin about the engines present in the HW.
We workaround this problem by allowing the initialization of all forcewake
domains and then pruning the fused off ones, as per the fuse information.

Bspec: 20680

v2: We were shifting incorrectly for vebox disable (Vinay)

v3: Assert mmio is ready and warn if we have attempted to initialize
    forcewake for fused-off engines (Paulo)

v4:
  - Use INTEL_GEN in new code (Tvrtko)
  - Shorter local variable (Tvrtko, Michal)
  - Keep "if (!...) continue" style (Tvrtko)
  - No unnecessary BUG_ON (Tvrtko)
  - WARN_ON and cleanup if wrong mask (Tvrtko, Michal)
  - Use I915_READ_FW (Michal)
  - Use I915_MAX_VCS/VECS macros (Michal)

v5: Rebased by Rodrigo fixing conflicts on top of:
    "drm/i915: Simplify intel_engines_init"

v6: Fix v5. Remove info->num_rings. (by Oscar)

v7: Rebase (Rodrigo).

v8:
  - s/intel_device_info_fused_off_engines/
    intel_device_info_init_mmio (Chris)
  - Make vdbox_disable & vebox_disable local variables (Chris)

v9:
  - Move function declaration to intel_device_info.h (Michal)
  - Missing indent in bit fields definitions (Michal)
  - When RC6 is enabled by BIOS, the fuse register cannot be read until
    the blitter powerwell is awake. Shuffle where the fuse is read, prune
    the forcewake domains after the fact and change the commit message
    accordingly (Vinay, Sagar, Chris).

v10:
  - Improved commit message (Sagar)
  - New line in header file (Sagar)
  - Specify the message in fw_domain_reset applies to ICL+ (Sagar)
