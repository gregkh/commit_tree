drm/i915/selftests: Include the trace as a debug aide

If we fail to reset the GPU in a timely fashion, dump the GEM trace so
that we can see what operations were in flight when the GPU got stuck.

v2: There's more than one timeout that deserves tracing!
v3: Silence checkpatch by not even using a product at all!
