net/ipv6: Add rt6_info create function for ip6_pol_route_lookup

ip6_pol_route_lookup is the lookup function for ip6_route_lookup and
rt6_lookup. At the moment it returns either a reference to a FIB entry
or a cached exception. To move FIB entries to a separate struct, this
lookup function needs to convert FIB entries to an rt6_info that is
returned to the caller.
