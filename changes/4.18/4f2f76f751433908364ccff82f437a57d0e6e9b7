ext4: fix fencepost error in check for inode count overflow during resize

ext4_resize_fs() has an off-by-one bug when checking whether growing of
a filesystem will not overflow inode count. As a result it allows a
filesystem with 8192 inodes per group to grow to 64TB which overflows
inode count to 0 and makes filesystem unusable. Fix it.
