nfp: remove phys_port_name on flower's vNIC

.ndo_get_phys_port_name was recently extended to support multi-vNIC
FWs.  These are firmwares which can have more than one vNIC per PF
without associated port (e.g. Adaptive Buffer Management FW), therefore
we need a way of distinguishing the vNICs.  Unfortunately, it's too
late to make flower use the same naming.  Flower users may depend on
.ndo_get_phys_port_name returning -EOPNOTSUPP, for example the name
udev gave the PF vNIC was just the bare PCI device-based name before
the change, and will have 'nn0' appended after.

To ensure flower's vNIC doesn't have phys_port_name attribute, add
a flag to vNIC struct and set it in flower code.  New projects will
not set the flag adhere to the naming scheme from the start.
