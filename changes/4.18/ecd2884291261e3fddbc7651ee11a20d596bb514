cpufreq: schedutil: Don't set next_freq to UINT_MAX

The schedutil driver sets sg_policy->next_freq to UINT_MAX on certain
occasions to discard the cached value of next freq:
- In sugov_start(), when the schedutil governor is started for a group
  of CPUs.
- And whenever we need to force a freq update before rate-limit
  duration, which happens when:
  - there is an update in cpufreq policy limits.
  - Or when the utilization of DL scheduling class increases.

In return, get_next_freq() doesn't return a cached next_freq value but
recalculates the next frequency instead.

But having special meaning for a particular value of frequency makes the
code less readable and error prone. We recently fixed a bug where the
UINT_MAX value was considered as valid frequency in
sugov_update_single().

All we need is a flag which can be used to discard the value of
sg_policy->next_freq and we already have need_freq_update for that. Lets
reuse it instead of setting next_freq to UINT_MAX.
