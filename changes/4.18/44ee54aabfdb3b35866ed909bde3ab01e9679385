watchdog: da9063: Fix updating timeout value

The DA9063 watchdog has only one register field to store the timeout value
and to enable the watchdog. The watchdog gets enabled if the value is
not zero. There is no issue if the watchdog is already running but it
leads into problems if the watchdog is disabled.

If the watchdog is disabled and only the timeout value should be prepared
the watchdog gets enabled too. Add a check to get the current watchdog
state and update the watchdog timeout value on hw-side only if the
watchdog is already active.
