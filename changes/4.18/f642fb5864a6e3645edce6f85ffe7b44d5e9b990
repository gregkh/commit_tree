x86/platform/UV: Add adjustable set memory block size function

Add a new function to "adjust" the current fixed UV memory block size
of 2GB so it can be changed to a different physical boundary.  This is
out of necessity so arch dependent code can accommodate specific BIOS
requirements which can align these new PMEM modules at less than the
default boundaries.

A "set order" type of function was used to insure that the memory block
size will be a power of two value without requiring a validity check.
64GB was chosen as the upper limit for memory block size values to
accommodate upcoming 4PB systems which have 6 more bits of physical
address space (46 becoming 52).
