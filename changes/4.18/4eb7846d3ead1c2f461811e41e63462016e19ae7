media: imx274: rename and reorder register address definitions

Most registers are defined using the name used in the datasheet.
E.g. the defines for the HMAX register are IMX274_HMAX_REG_*.

Rename the SHR and VMAX register accordingly. Also move them close to
related registers: SHR close to SVR, VMAX close to HMAX.
