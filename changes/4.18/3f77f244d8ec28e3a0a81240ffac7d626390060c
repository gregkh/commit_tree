mtd: rawnand: mxc: set spare area size register explicitly

The v21 version of the NAND flash controller contains a Spare Area Size
Register (SPAS) at offset 0x10. Its setting defaults to the maximum
spare area size of 218 bytes. The size that is set in this register is
used by the controller when it calculates the ECC bytes internally in
hardware.

Usually, this register is updated from settings in the IIM fuses when
the system is booting from NAND flash. For other boot media, however,
the SPAS register remains at the default setting, which may not work for
the particular flash chip on the board. The same goes for flash chips
whose configuration cannot be set in the IIM fuses (e.g. chips with 2k
sector size and 128 bytes spare area size can't be configured in the IIM
fuses on imx25 systems).

Set the SPAS register explicitly during the preset operation. Derive the
register value from mtd->oobsize that was detected during probe by
decoding the flash chip's ID bytes.

While at it, rename the define for the spare area register's offset to
NFC_V21_RSLTSPARE_AREA. The register at offset 0x10 on v1 controllers is
different from the register on v21 controllers.
