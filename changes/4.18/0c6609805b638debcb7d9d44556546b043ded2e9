mfd: stm32-timers: Add support for DMAs

STM32 Timers can support up to 7 DMA requests:
- 4 channels, update, compare and trigger.
Optionally request part, or all DMAs from stm32-timers MFD core.

Also add routine to implement burst reads using DMA from timer registers.
This is exported. So, it can be used by child drivers, PWM capture
for instance (but not limited to).
