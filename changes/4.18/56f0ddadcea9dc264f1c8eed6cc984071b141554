ide: Handle irq disabling consistently

ide_timer_expiry() disables interrupt at function entry when acquiring
hwif->lock. Before disabling the device interrupt it unlocks hwif->lock,
but interrupts stay disabled. After the call to disable_irq() interrupts
are disabled again, which is a pointless exercise.

After the device irq handler has been invoked with interrupts disabled,
hwif->lock is acquired again with spin_lock_irq() because the device irq
handler might have reenabled interrupts. This is not documented and
confusing for the casual reader.

Remove the redundant local_irq_disable() and add a comment which explains
why hwif->lock has to be reacquired with spin_lock_irq().
