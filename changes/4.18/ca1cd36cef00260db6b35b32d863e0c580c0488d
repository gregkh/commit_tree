Input: atmel_mxt_ts - fix reset-gpio for level based irqs

The current reset-gpio support triggers an interrupt storm on platforms
using the maxtouch with level based interrupt. The Motorola Droid 4,
which I used for some of the tests is not affected, since it uses a edge
based interrupt.

This change avoids the interrupt storm by enabling the device while its
interrupt is disabled. Afterwards we wait 100ms. This is important for
two reasons: The device is unresponsive for some time (~22ms for
mxt224E) and the CHG (interrupt) line is not working properly for 100ms.
We don't need to wait for any following interrupts, since the following
mxt_initialize() checks for bootloader mode anyways.

This fixes a boot issue on GE PPD (watchdog kills device due to
interrupt storm) and does not cause regression on Motorola Droid 4.
