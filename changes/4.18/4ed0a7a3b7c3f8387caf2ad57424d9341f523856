btrfs: trace: Add trace points for unused block groups

This patch will add the following trace events:
1) btrfs_remove_block_group
   For btrfs_remove_block_group() function.
   Triggered when a block group is really removed.

2) btrfs_add_unused_block_group
   Triggered which block group is added to unused_bgs list.

3) btrfs_skip_unused_block_group
   Triggered which unused block group is not deleted.

These trace events is pretty handy to debug case related to block group
auto remove.
