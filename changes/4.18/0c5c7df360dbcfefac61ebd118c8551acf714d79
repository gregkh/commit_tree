drm/i915/execlists: Log fence context & seqno throughout GEM_TRACE

Include fence context and seqno in low level tracing so it is easier to
follow flows of individual requests when things go bad.

Also added tracing on the reset side of things.

v2:
 Chris Wilson:
 * Standardize global_seqno and seqno as global.
 * Include current hws seqno in execlists_cancel_port_requests.

v3:
 * Fix port printk format for all builds.
