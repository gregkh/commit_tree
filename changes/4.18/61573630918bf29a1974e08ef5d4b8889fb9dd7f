scsi: hisi_sas: update RAS feature for later revision of v3 HW

There is an modification for later revision of v3 hw. More HW errors are
reported through RAS interrupt. These errors were originally reported
only through MSI.

When report to RAS, some combinations are done to port AXI errors and
FIFO OMIT errors. For example, each port has 4 AXI errors, and they are
combined to one when report to RAS.

This patch does two things:

1. Enable RAS interrupt of these errors and handle them in PCI
   error handlers.

2. Disable MSI interrupts of these errors for this later revision hw.
