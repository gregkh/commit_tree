signal: Remove no longer required irqsave/restore

Commit a841796f11c9 ("signal: align __lock_task_sighand() irq disabling and
RCU") introduced a rcu read side critical section with interrupts
disabled. The changelog suggested that a better long-term fix would be "to
make rt_mutex_unlock() disable irqs when acquiring the rt_mutex structure's
->wait_lock".

This long-term fix has been made in commit b4abf91047cf ("rtmutex: Make
wait_lock irq safe") for a different reason.

Therefore revert commit a841796f11c9 ("signal: align >
__lock_task_sighand() irq disabling and RCU") as the interrupt disable
dance is not longer required.

The change was tested on the base of b4abf91047cf ("rtmutex: Make wait_lock
irq safe") with a four hour run of rcutorture scenario TREE03 with lockdep
enabled as suggested by Paul McKenney.
