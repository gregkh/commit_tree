spi: sh-msiof: Fix setting SIRMDR1.SYNCAC to match SITMDR1.SYNCAC

According to section 59.2.4 MSIOF Receive Mode Register 1 (SIRMDR1) in
the R-Car Gen3 datasheet Rev.1.00, the value of the SIRMDR1.SYNCAC bit
must match the value of the SITMDR1.SYNCAC bit.  However,
sh_msiof_spi_setup() changes only the latter.

Fix this by updating the SIRMDR1 register like the SITMDR1 register,
taking into account register bits that exist in SITMDR1 only.
