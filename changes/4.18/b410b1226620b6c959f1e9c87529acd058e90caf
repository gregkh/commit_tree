platform/chrome: cros_ec_lpc: do not try DMI match when ACPI device found

Older models of Chromebooks did not describe the LPC EC in their ACPI
tables; starting with Strago-based devices Google is using GOOG0004 device
to describe EC LPC.

DMI-based match is fragile and does not work reliably, especially when
using custom firmware. It is also not needed when we can locate the right
ACPI device, so let's stop bailing out when DMI does not match but the
right ACPI device is present.
