crypto/arm64: aes-ce-gcm - add missing kernel_neon_begin/end pair

Calling pmull_gcm_encrypt_block() requires kernel_neon_begin() and
kernel_neon_end() to be used since the routine touches the NEON
register file. Add the missing calls.

Also, since NEON register contents are not preserved outside of
a kernel mode NEON region, pass the key schedule array again.
