mm: use octal not symbolic permissions

mm/*.c files use symbolic and octal styles for permissions.

Using octal and not symbolic permissions is preferred by many as more
readable.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/2/1945

Prefer the direct use of octal for permissions.

Done using
$ scripts/checkpatch.pl -f --types=SYMBOLIC_PERMS --fix-inplace mm/*.c
and some typing.

Before:	 $ git grep -P -w "0[0-7]{3,3}" mm | wc -l
44
After:	 $ git grep -P -w "0[0-7]{3,3}" mm | wc -l
86

Miscellanea:

o Whitespace neatening around these conversions.
