drm/sti: Depend on OF rather than selecting it

Commit cc6b741c6f63 ("drm: sti: remove useless fields from vtg
structure") reworked some code inside of this driver and made it select
CONFIG_OF. This results in the entire OF layer being enabled when
building an allmodconfig on ia64. OF on ia64 is completely unsupported
so this isn't a great state of affairs.

The 0day robot noticed a link-time failure on ia64 caused by
using of_node_to_nid() in an otherwise unrelated driver. The
generic fallback for of_node_to_nid() only exists when:

	defined(CONFIG_OF) && defined(CONFIG_NUMA) == false

Since CONFIG_NUMA is usually selected for IA64 we get the link failure.
Fix this by making the driver depend on OF rather than selecting it,
odds are that was the original intent.
