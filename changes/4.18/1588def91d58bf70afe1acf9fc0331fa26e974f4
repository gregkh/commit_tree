afs: Mark afs_net::ws_cell as __rcu and set using rcu functions

The afs_net::ws_cell member is sometimes used under RCU conditions from
within an seq-readlock.  It isn't, however, marked __rcu and it isn't set
using the proper RCU barrier-imposing functions.

Fix this by annotating it with __rcu and using appropriate barriers to
make sure accesses are correctly ordered.

Without this, the code can produce the following warning:

>> fs/afs/proc.c:151:24: sparse: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)
