net: dsa: Plug in PHYLINK support

Add support for PHYLINK within the DSA subsystem in order to support more
complex devices such as pluggable (SFP) and non-pluggable (SFF) modules, 10G
PHYs, and traditional PHYs. Using PHYLINK allows us to drop some amount of
complexity we had while probing fixed and non-fixed PHYs using Device Tree.

Because PHYLINK separates the Ethernet MAC/port configuration into different
stages, we let switch drivers implement those, and for now, we maintain
functionality by calling dsa_slave_adjust_link() during
phylink_mac_link_{up,down} which provides semantically equivalent steps.

Drivers willing to take advantage of PHYLINK should implement the phylink_mac_*
operations that DSA wraps.

We cannot quite remove the adjust_link() callback just yet, because a number of
drivers rely on that for configuring their "CPU" and "DSA" ports, this is done
dsa_port_setup_phy_of() and dsa_port_fixed_link_register_of() still.

Drivers that utilize fixed links for user-facing ports (e.g: bcm_sf2) will need
to implement phylink_mac_ops from now on to preserve functionality, since PHYLINK
*does not* create a phy_device instance for fixed links.
