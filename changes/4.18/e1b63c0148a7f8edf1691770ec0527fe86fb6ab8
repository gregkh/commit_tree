HID: store the full list of reports in the hidinput

We were only storing the report in case of QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT.
It is interesting for the upcoming  HID_QUIRK_INPUT_PER_APP to also
store the full list of reports that are attached to it.

We need the full list because a device (Advanced Silicon has some)
might want to use a different report ID for the Input reports and
the Output reports. Storing the full list allows the drivers to
have all the data.
