misc: IBM Virtual Management Channel Driver (VMC)

This driver is a logical device which provides an
interface between the hypervisor and a management
partition. This interface is like a message
passing interface. This management partition
is intended to provide an alternative to HMC-based
system management.

VMC enables the Management LPAR to provide basic
logical partition functions:
- Logical Partition Configuration
- Boot, start, and stop actions for individual
  partitions
- Display of partition status
- Management of virtual Ethernet
- Management of virtual Storage
- Basic system management

This driver is to be used for the POWER Virtual
Management Channel Virtual Adapter on the PowerPC
platform. It provides a character device which
allows for both request/response and async message
support through the /dev/ibmvmc node.
