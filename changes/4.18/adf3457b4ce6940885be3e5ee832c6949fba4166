HISI LPC: Add ACPI UART support

On the Huawei D03 development board the system UART is
the UART connected on the LPC bus.

The profile for the device driver required for this HW
is as follows:
 - platform driver
 - 16550
 - ACPI support
 - polling mode support
 - IO space support

In principle we should use the PNP driver (8250_dw.c) for
8250-devices with ACPI FW. However since this driver does
not support PNP devices, and modifying the PNP core code
to support it is not worth the effort, use the generic
8250 isa driver.

For this, we setup the pdev platform data for the serial
8250 port.
