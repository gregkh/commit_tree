iio: mma8452: Fix ignoring MMA8452_INT_DRDY

Interrupts are ignored if no event bit is set in the status status
register and this breaks the buffer interface. No data is shown when
running "iio_generic_buffer -n mma8451 -a" and interrupt counts go
crazy.

Fix by not returning IRQ_NONE if DRDY is set.

multiple events")
