ALSA: dice: add parameters of stream formats for models produced by Alesis

Alesis shipped some models with DICE ASICs. All of them just support
DICE original protocol and drivers can't retrieve all of available stream
formats without changing status of sampling transmission frequency
actually.

This commit puts some hard-coded parameters for the models. When detecting
the models, the corresponding parameters are copied as cache of stream
formats.

I note that each of pair of iO14/iO26 and MultiMix 8/12/16 has the same
model ID on their configuration ROM. The MultiMix 8/12/16 just support
one mode for sampling transmission frequency and ALSA dice driver already
handles them correctly. The iO14/iO26 support three modes and need
hard-coded parameters. To distinguish these two models, this commit let
the driver to retrieve current stream formats and compare it to known
parameters, then decide it.
