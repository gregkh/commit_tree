ALSA: hda/ca0132: Delete redundant UNSOL event requests

During ca0132_init(), ca0132_init_unsol() is run before the
spec->spec_init_verbs are written.  ca0132_init_unsol() calls
snd_hda_jack_detect_enable_callback(), which requests UNSOL events
for three or four nodes, two of which were also (redundantly)
requested by spec_init_verbs.

Kill the redundant AC_VERB_SET_UNSOLICITED_ENABLE verbs.
