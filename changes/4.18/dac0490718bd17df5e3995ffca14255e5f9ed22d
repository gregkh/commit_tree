bnxt_en: Check unsupported speeds in bnxt_update_link() on PF only.

Only non-NPAR PFs need to actively check and manage unsupported link
speeds.  NPAR functions and VFs do not control the link speed and
should skip the unsupported speed detection logic, to avoid warning
messages from firmware rejecting the unsupported firmware calls.
