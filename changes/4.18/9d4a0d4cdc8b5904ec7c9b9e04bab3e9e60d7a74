drm/amdgpu: Verify root PD is mapped into kernel address space (v4)

Problem: When PD/PT update made by CPU root PD was not yet mapped causing
page fault.

Fix: Verify root PD is mapped into CPU address space.

v2:
Make sure that we add the root PD to the relocated list
since then it's get mapped into CPU address space bt default
in amdgpu_vm_update_directories.

v3:
Drop change to not move kernel type BOs to evicted list.

v4:
Remove redundant bo move to relocated list.
