strparser: Don't schedule in workqueue in paused state

In function strp_data_ready(), it is useless to call queue_work if
the state of strparser is already paused. The state checking should
be done before calling queue_work. The change reduces the context
switches and improves the ktls-rx throughput by approx 20% (measured
on cortex-a53 based platform).
