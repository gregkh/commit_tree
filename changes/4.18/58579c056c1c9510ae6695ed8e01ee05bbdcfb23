ALSA: dice: use extended protocol to detect available stream formats

TC Applied Technologies (TCAT) have added extension to DICE protocol. This
protocol extension is called as Extended Application Protocol, a.k.a. EAP.

In this protocol extension, units get additional 9 address spaces. One of
it is for current configuration. In this address space, a pair of router
and stream formats are exposed per mode of three sampling transmission
frequencies.

This commit adds support the protocol extension for address space of the
current configuration to generate cache of stream formats.
