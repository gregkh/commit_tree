lib/string_helpers: Add missed declaration of struct task_struct

Starting from the commit 0d0443288f22 the new function has been
introduced which takes struct task_struct as a parameter. Though,
compiler doesn't know where to get information about it at this stage.

Add missed declaration of struct task_struct to satisfy compiler.
