media: v4l: cadence: Add Cadence MIPI-CSI2 TX driver

The Cadence MIPI-CSI2 TX controller is an hardware block meant to be used
as a bridge between pixel interfaces and a CSI-2 bus.

It supports operating with an internal or external D-PHY, with up to 4
lanes, or without any D-PHY. The current code only supports the latter
case.

While the virtual channel input on the pixel interface can be directly
mapped to CSI2, the datatype input is actually a selection signal (3-bits)
mapping to a table of up to 8 preconfigured datatypes/formats (programmed
at start-up)

The block supports up to 8 input datatypes.
