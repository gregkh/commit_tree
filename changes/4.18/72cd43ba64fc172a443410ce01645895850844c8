tcp: free batches of packets in tcp_prune_ofo_queue()

Juha-Matti Tilli reported that malicious peers could inject tiny
packets in out_of_order_queue, forcing very expensive calls
to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for
every incoming packet. out_of_order_queue rb-tree can contain
thousands of nodes, iterating over all of them is not nice.

Before linux-4.9, we would have pruned all packets in ofo_queue
in one go, every XXXX packets. XXXX depends on sk_rcvbuf and skbs
truesize, but is about 7000 packets with tcp_rmem[2] default of 6 MB.

Since we plan to increase tcp_rmem[2] in the future to cope with
modern BDP, can not revert to the old behavior, without great pain.

Strategy taken in this patch is to purge ~12.5 % of the queue capacity.
