HID: wacom: Correct logical maximum Y for 2nd-gen Intuos Pro large

The HID descriptor for the 2nd-gen Intuos Pro large (PTH-860) contains
a typo which defines an incorrect logical maximum Y value. This causes
a small portion of the bottom of the tablet to become unusable (both
because the area is below the "bottom" of the tablet and because
'wacom_wac_event' ignores out-of-range values). It also results in a
skewed aspect ratio.

To fix this, we add a quirk to 'wacom_usage_mapping' which overwrites
the data with the correct value.
