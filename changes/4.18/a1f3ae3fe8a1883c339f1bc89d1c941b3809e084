powerpc/32: Use stmw/lmw for registers save/restore in asm

arch/powerpc/Makefile activates -mmultiple on BE PPC32 configs
in order to use multiple word instructions in functions entry/exit.

The patch does the same for the asm parts, for consistency.

On processors like the 8xx on which insn fetching is pretty slow,
this speeds up registers save/restore.
