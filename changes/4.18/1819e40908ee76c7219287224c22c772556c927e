net: hns3: Fix for VF mailbox cannot receiving PF response

When the VF frequently switches the CMDQ interrupt, if the CMDQ_SRC is not
cleared, the VF will not receive the new PF response after the interrupt
is re-enabled, the corresponding log is as follows:

[  317.482222] hns3 0000:00:03.0: VF could not get mbx resp(=0) from PF
in 500 tries
[  317.483137] hns3 0000:00:03.0: VF request to get tqp info from PF
failed -5

This patch fixes this problem by clearing CMDQ_SRC before enabling
interrupt and syncing pending IRQ handlers after disabling interrupt.
