bnx2x: Collect the device debug information during Tx timeout.

Tx-timeout mostly happens due to some issue in the device. In such cases,
debug dump would be helpful for identifying the cause of the issue.
This patch adds support to spill debug data during the Tx timeout. Here
bnx2x_panic_dump() API is used instead of bnx2x_panic(), since we still
want to allow the Tx-timeout recovery a chance to succeed.

Changes from previous version:
-------------------------------
v2: Fixed a coding error.

Please consider applying this to "net-next".
