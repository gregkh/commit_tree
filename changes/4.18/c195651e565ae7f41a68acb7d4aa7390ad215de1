bpf: add bpf_get_stack helper

Currently, stackmap and bpf_get_stackid helper are provided
for bpf program to get the stack trace. This approach has
a limitation though. If two stack traces have the same hash,
only one will get stored in the stackmap table,
so some stack traces are missing from user perspective.

This patch implements a new helper, bpf_get_stack, will
send stack traces directly to bpf program. The bpf program
is able to see all stack traces, and then can do in-kernel
processing or send stack traces to user space through
shared map or bpf_perf_event_output.
