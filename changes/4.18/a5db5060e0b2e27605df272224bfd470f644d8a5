powerpc/mm/hash: hard disable irq in the SLB insert path

When inserting SLB entries for EA above 512TB, we need to hard disable irq.
This will make sure we don't take a PMU interrupt that can possibly touch
user space address via a stack dump. To prevent this, we need to hard disable
the interrupt.

Also add a comment explaining why we don't need context synchronizing isync
with slbmte.
