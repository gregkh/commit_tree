staging: wilc1000: Avoid overriding rates_no while parsing ies element.

Commit d4b4aaba515a ("staging: wilc1000: fix line over 80 characters in
host_int_parse_join_bss_param()") introduced a bug by not keeping the
rates_no value while parsing ies elements.
It also increments auth_total_cnt as a pointer instead of its reference.

This commit fixes the bug by passing reference to rates_no to
host_int_parse_join_bss_param() and by incrementing reference of
auth_total_cnt
