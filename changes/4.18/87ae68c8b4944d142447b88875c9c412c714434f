ipv6: omit traffic class when calculating flow hash

Some of the code paths calculating flow hash for IPv6 use flowlabel member
of struct flowi6 which, despite its name, encodes both flow label and
traffic class. If traffic class changes within a TCP connection (as e.g.
ssh does), ECMP route can switch between path. It's also incosistent with
other code paths where ip6_flowlabel() (returning only flow label) is used
to feed the key.

Use only flow label everywhere, including one place where hash key is set
using ip6_flowinfo().
