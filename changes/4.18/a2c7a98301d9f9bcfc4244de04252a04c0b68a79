x86/bpf: Clean up non-standard comments, to make the code more readable

So by chance I looked into x86 assembly in arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and
noticed the weird and inconsistent comment style it mistakenly learned from
the networking code:

 /* Multi-line comment ...
  * ... looks like this.
  */

Fix this to use the standard comment style specified in Documentation/CodingStyle
and used in arch/x86/ as well:

 /*
  * Multi-line comment ...
  * ... looks like this.
  */

Also, to quote Linus's ... more explicit views about this:

Also improve the comments and some other details while at it:

 - Don't mix same-line and previous-line comment style on otherwise
   identical code patterns within the same function,

 - capitalize 'BPF' and x86 register names consistently,

 - capitalize sentences consistently,

 - instead of 'x64' use 'x86-64': x64 is a Microsoft specific term,

 - use more consistent punctuation,

 - use standard coding style in macros as well,

 - fix typos and a few other minor details.

Consistent coding style is not optional, at least in arch/x86/.

No change in functionality.

( In case this commit causes conflicts with pending development code
  I'll be glad to help resolve any conflicts! )
