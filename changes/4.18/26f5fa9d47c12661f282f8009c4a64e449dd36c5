scsi: zfcp: decouple SCSI setup of TMF from scsi_cmnd

Actually change the signature of zfcp_fsf_fcp_task_mgmt().
Since it was prepared in the previous patch, we only need to delete
a local auto variable which is now the intended argument.

Prepare zfcp_fsf_fcp_task_mgmt's caller zfcp_task_mgmt_function()
to have its function body only depend on a scsi_device and derived objects.
