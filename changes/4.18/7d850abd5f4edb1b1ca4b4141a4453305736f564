net: bridge: add support for port isolation

This patch adds support for a new port flag - BR_ISOLATED. If it is set
then isolated ports cannot communicate between each other, but they can
still communicate with non-isolated ports. The same can be achieved via
ACLs but they can't scale with large number of ports and also the
complexity of the rules grows. This feature can be used to achieve
isolated vlan functionality (similar to pvlan) as well, though currently
it will be port-wide (for all vlans on the port). The new test in
should_deliver uses data that is already cache hot and the new boolean
is used to avoid an additional source port test in should_deliver.
