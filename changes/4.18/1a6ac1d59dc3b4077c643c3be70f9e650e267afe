bpf, doc: convert bpf_design_QA.rst to use RST formatting

The RST formatting is done such that that when rendered or converted
to different formats, an automatic index with links are created to the
subsections.

Thus, the questions are created as sections (or subsections), in-order
to get the wanted auto-generated FAQ/QA index.

Special thanks to Quentin Monnet <quentin.monnet@netronome.com> who
have reviewed and corrected both RST formatting and GitHub rendering
issues in this file.  Those commits have been squashed.

I've manually tested that this also renders nicely if included as part
of the kernel 'make htmldocs'.  As the end-goal is for this to become
more integrated with kernel-doc project/movement.
