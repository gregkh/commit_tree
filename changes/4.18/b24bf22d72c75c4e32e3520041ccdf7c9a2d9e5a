scsi: zfcp: explicitly support initiator in scsi_host_template

While the default did already correctly print "Initiator" let's make it
explicit and convert zfcp to the feature.

$ cat /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/supported_mode
Initiator

$ cat /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/active_mode
Initiator

The default worked, because not setting the field has it initialized to zero
== MODE_UNKNOWN. scsi_host_alloc() sets shost->active_mode = MODE_INITIATOR
in this case. The sysfs accessor function show_shost_supported_mode()
assumes MODE_INITIATOR in this case.  This default behavior was introduced
with v2.6.24 commit 7a39ac3f25be ("[SCSI] make supported_mode default to
initiator.").  The feature flag was introduced with v2.6.24 commit
5dc2b89e1242 ("[SCSI] add supported_mode and active_mode attributes to the
host").  So there was no release where zfcp would have shown "unknown".
