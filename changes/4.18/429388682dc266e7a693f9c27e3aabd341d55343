arm64: Avoid flush_icache_range() in alternatives patching code

The implementation of flush_icache_range() includes instruction sequences
which are themselves patched at runtime, so it is not safe to call from
the patching framework.

This patch reworks the alternatives cache-flushing code so that it rolls
its own internal D-cache maintenance using DC CIVAC before invalidating
the entire I-cache after all alternatives have been applied at boot.
Modules don't cause any issues, since flush_icache_range() is safe to
call by the time they are loaded.
