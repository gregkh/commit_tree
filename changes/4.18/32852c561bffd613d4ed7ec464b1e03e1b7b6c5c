can: xilinx_can: fix RX loop if RXNEMP is asserted without RXOK

If the device gets into a state where RXNEMP (RX FIFO not empty)
interrupt is asserted without RXOK (new frame received successfully)
interrupt being asserted, xcan_rx_poll() will continue to try to clear
RXNEMP without actually reading frames from RX FIFO. If the RX FIFO is
not empty, the interrupt will not be cleared and napi_schedule() will
just be called again.

This situation can occur when:

(a) xcan_rx() returns without reading RX FIFO due to an error condition.
The code tries to clear both RXOK and RXNEMP but RXNEMP will not clear
due to a frame still being in the FIFO. The frame will never be read
from the FIFO as RXOK is no longer set.

(b) A frame is received between xcan_rx_poll() reading interrupt status
and clearing RXOK. RXOK will be cleared, but RXNEMP will again remain
set as the new message is still in the FIFO.

I'm able to trigger case (b) by flooding the bus with frames under load.

There does not seem to be any benefit in using both RXNEMP and RXOK in
the way the driver does, and the polling example in the reference manual
(UG585 v1.10 18.3.7 Read Messages from RxFIFO) also says that either
RXOK or RXNEMP can be used for detecting incoming messages.

Fix the issue and simplify the RX processing by only using RXNEMP
without RXOK.

Tested with the integrated CAN on Zynq-7000 SoC.
