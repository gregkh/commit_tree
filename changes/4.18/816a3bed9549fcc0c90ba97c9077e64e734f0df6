switchdev: Add fdb.added_by_user to switchdev notifications

The following patch enables sending notifications also for events on FDB
entries that weren't added by the user. Give the drivers the information
necessary to distinguish between the two origins of FDB entries.

To maintain the current behavior, have switchdev-implementing drivers
bail out on notifications about non-user-added FDB entries. In case of
mlxsw driver, allow a call to mlxsw_sp_span_respin() so that SPAN over
bridge catches up with the changed FDB.
