ipv6: Only emit append events for appended routes

Current code will emit an append event in the FIB notification chain for
any route added with NLM_F_APPEND set, even if the route was not
appended to any existing route.

This is inconsistent with IPv4 where such an event is only emitted when
the new route is appended after an existing one.

Align IPv6 behavior with IPv4, thereby allowing listeners to more easily
handle these events.
