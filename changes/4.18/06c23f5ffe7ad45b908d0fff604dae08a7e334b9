ARM: spectre-v2: harden branch predictor on context switches

Harden the branch predictor against Spectre v2 attacks on context
switches for ARMv7 and later CPUs.  We do this by:

Cortex A9, A12, A17, A73, A75: invalidating the BTB.
Cortex A15, Brahma B15: invalidating the instruction cache.

Cortex A57 and Cortex A72 are not addressed in this patch.

Cortex R7 and Cortex R8 are also not addressed as we do not enforce
memory protection on these cores.
