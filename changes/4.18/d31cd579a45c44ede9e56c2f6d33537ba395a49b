bnxt_en: Remap TC to hardware queues when configuring PFC.

Initially, the MQPRIO TCs are mapped 1:1 directly to the hardware
queues.  Some of these hardware queues are configured to be lossless.
When PFC is enabled on one of more TCs, we now need to remap the
TCs that have PFC enabled to the lossless hardware queues.

After remapping, we need to close and open the NIC for the new
mapping to take effect.  We also need to reprogram all ETS parameters.
