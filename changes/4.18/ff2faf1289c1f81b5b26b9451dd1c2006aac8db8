ASoC: dapm: delete dapm_kcontrol_data paths list before freeing it

dapm_kcontrol_data is freed as part of dapm_kcontrol_free(), leaving the
paths pointer dangling in the list.

This leads to system crash when we try to unload and reload sound card.
I hit this bug during ADSP crash/reboot test case on Dragon board DB410c.

Without this patch, on SLAB Poisoning enabled build, kernel crashes with
"BUG kmalloc-128 (Tainted: G        W        ): Poison overwritten"
