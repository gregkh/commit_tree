samples, bpf: remove redundant ret assignment in bpf_load_program()

2 redundant ret assignments removed:

* 'ret = 1' before the logic 'if (data_maps)', and if any errors jump to
  label 'done'. No 'ret = 1' needed before the error jump.

* After the '/* load programs */' part, if everything goes well, then
  the BPF code will be loaded and 'ret' set to 0 by load_and_attach().
  If something goes wrong, 'ret' set to none-O, the redundant 'ret = 0'
  after the for clause will make the error skipped.

  For example, if some BPF code cannot provide supported program types
  in ELF SEC("unknown"), the for clause will not call load_and_attach()
  to load the BPF code. 1 should be returned to callees instead of 0.
