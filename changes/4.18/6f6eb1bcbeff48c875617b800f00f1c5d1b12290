ath10k: DFS Host Confirmation

In the 10.4-3.6 firmware branch there's a new DFS Host confirmation
feature which is advertised using WMI_SERVICE_HOST_DFS_CHECK_SUPPORT flag.

This new features enables the ath10k host to send information to the
firmware on the specifications of detected radar type. This allows the
firmware to validate if the host's radar pattern detector unit is
operational and check if the radar information shared by host matches
the radar pulses sent as phy error events from firmware. If the check
fails the firmware won't allow use of DFS channels on AP mode when using
FCC regulatory region.

Hence this patch is mandatory when using a firmware from 10.4-3.6 branch.
Else, DFS channels on FCC regions cannot be used.

Supported Chipsets : QCA9984/QCA9888/QCA4019
Firmware Version : 10.4-3.6-00104
