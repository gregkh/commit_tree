block, bfq: remove wrong lock in bfq_requests_merged

In bfq_requests_merged(), there is a deadlock because the lock on
bfqq->bfqd->lock is held by the calling function, but the code of
this function tries to grab the lock again.

This deadlock is currently hidden by another bug (fixed by next commit
for this source file), which causes the body of bfq_requests_merged()
to be never executed.

This commit removes the deadlock by removing the lock/unlock pair.
