drm/i915: Don't dump umpteen thousand requests

If we have more than a few, possibly several thousand request in the
queue, don't show the central portion, just the first few and the last
being executed and/or queued. The first few should be enough to help
identify a problem in execution, and most often comparing the first/last
in the queue is enough to identify problems in the scheduling.

We may need some fine tuning to set MAX_REQUESTS_TO_SHOW for common
debug scenarios, but for the moment if we can avoiding spending more
than a few seconds dumping the GPU state that will avoid a nasty
livelock (where hangcheck spends so long dumping the state, it fires
again and starts to dump the state again in parallel, ad infinitum).

v2: Remember to print last not the stale rq iter after the loop.
