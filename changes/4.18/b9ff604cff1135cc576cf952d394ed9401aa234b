timekeeping: Add ktime_get_coarse_with_offset

I have run into a couple of drivers using current_kernel_time()
suffering from the y2038 problem, and they could be converted
to using ktime_t, but don't have interfaces that skip the nanosecond
calculation at the moment.

This introduces ktime_get_coarse_with_offset() as a simpler
variant of ktime_get_with_offset(), and adds wrappers for the
three time domains we support with the existing function.
