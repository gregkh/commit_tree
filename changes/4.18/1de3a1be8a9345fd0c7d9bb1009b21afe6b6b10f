efi/x86: Ignore unrealistically large option ROMs

setup_efi_pci() tries to save a copy of each PCI option ROM as this may
be necessary for the device driver for the PCI device to have access too.

On some systems the efi_pci_io_protocol's romimage and romsize fields
contain invalid data, which looks a bit like pointers pointing back into
other EFI code or data. Interpreting these pointers as romsize leads to
a very large value and if we then try to alloc this amount of memory to
save a copy the alloc call fails.

This leads to a "Failed to alloc mem for rom" error being printed on the
EFI console for each PCI device.

This commit avoids the printing of these errors, by checking romsize before
doing the alloc and if it is larger then the EFI spec limit of 16 MiB
silently ignore the ROM fields instead of trying to alloc mem and fail.
