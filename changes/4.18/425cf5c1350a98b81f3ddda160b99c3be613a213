RDMA/qedr: Fix NULL pointer dereference when running over iWARP without RDMA-CM

Some RoCE specific code in qedr_modify_qp was run over an iWARP device
when running perftest benchmarks without the -R option.

The commit 3e44e0ee0893 ("IB/providers: Avoid null netdev check for RoCE")
exposed this. Dropping the check for NULL pointer on ndev in
qedr_modify_qp lead to a null pointer dereference when running over
iWARP. Before the code would identify ndev as being NULL and return an
error.
