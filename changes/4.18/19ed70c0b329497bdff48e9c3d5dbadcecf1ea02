mailbox: Remove depends on HAS_DMA in case of platform dependency

Remove dependencies on HAS_DMA where a Kconfig symbol depends on another
symbol that implies HAS_DMA, and, optionally, on "|| COMPILE_TEST".
In most cases this other symbol is an architecture or platform specific
symbol, or PCI.

Generic symbols and drivers without platform dependencies keep their
dependencies on HAS_DMA, to prevent compiling subsystems or drivers that
cannot work anyway.

This simplifies the dependencies, and allows to improve compile-testing.
