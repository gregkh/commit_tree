ALSA: hda/ca0132: Add new control changes for SBZ + R3Di

This patch adds new controls to set the effect levels on the R3Di and
SBZ. It also adds vmaster controls to control all surround sound
channels. So that Surround effect switch doesn't conflict with Surround
volume, FX: prefix added to all effect related switches.
