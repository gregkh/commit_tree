branch-check: fix long->int truncation when profiling branches

The function __builtin_expect returns long type (see the gcc
documentation), and so do macros likely and unlikely. Unfortunatelly, when
CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES is selected, the macros likely and
unlikely expand to __branch_check__ and __branch_check__ truncates the
long type to int. This unintended truncation may cause bugs in various
kernel code (we found a bug in dm-writecache because of it), so it's
better to fix __branch_check__ to return long.
