crypto: cavium - Limit result reading attempts

After issuing a request an endless loop was used to read the
completion state from memory which is asynchronously updated
by the ZIP coprocessor.

Add an upper bound to the retry attempts to prevent a CPU getting stuck
forever in case of an error. Additionally, add a read memory barrier
and a small delay between the reading attempts.
