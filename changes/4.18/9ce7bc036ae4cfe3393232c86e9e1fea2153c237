netfilter: ipv6: nf_defrag: reduce struct net memory waste

It is a waste of memory to use a full "struct netns_sysctl_ipv6"
while only one pointer is really used, considering netns_sysctl_ipv6
keeps growing.

Also, since "struct netns_frags" has cache line alignment,
it is better to move the frags_hdr pointer outside, otherwise
we spend a full cache line for this pointer.

This saves 192 bytes of memory per netns.
