cpufreq: intel_pstate: HWP boost performance on IO wakeup

This change uses SCHED_CPUFREQ_IOWAIT flag to boost HWP performance.
Since SCHED_CPUFREQ_IOWAIT flag is set frequently, we don't start
boosting steps unless we see two consecutive flags in two ticks. This
avoids boosting due to IO because of regular system activities.

To avoid synchronization issues, the actual processing of the flag is
done on the local CPU callback.
