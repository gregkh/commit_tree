mmc: renesas_sdhi: Fix alignment check of sg buffer

Sometimes sg->offset is not used for buffer addresses allocated by
dma_map_sg(), so alignment checks should be done on the allocated buffer
addresses. Delete the alignment check for sg->offset that is done before
dma_map_sg(). Instead, it performs the alignment check for
sg->dma_address after dma_map_sg().
