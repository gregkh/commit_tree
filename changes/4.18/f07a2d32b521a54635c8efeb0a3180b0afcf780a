perf thread: Introduce thread__find_map()

Out of thread__find_add_map(..., MAP__FUNCTION, ...), idea here is to
continue removing references to MAP__{FUNCTION,VARIABLE} ahead of
getting both types of symbols in the same rbtree, as various places do
two lookups, looking first at MAP__FUNCTION, then at MAP__VARIABLE.

So thread__find_map() will eventually do just that, and 'struct symbol'
will have the symbol type, for code that cares about that.
