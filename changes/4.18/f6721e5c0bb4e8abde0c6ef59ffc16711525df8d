phy: qcom-qmp: Add QMP V3 USB3 UNI PHY support for sdm845

QMP V3 UNI PHY is a single lane USB3 PHY without support
for DisplayPort (DP).
Main difference from DP combo QMPv3 PHY is that UNI PHY
doesn't have dual RX/TX lanes and no separate DP_COM
block for configuration related to type-c or DP.
Also remove "qcom,qmp-v3-usb3-phy" compatible string which
was earlier added for sdm845 only as there wouldn't be
any user of same.
While at it, fix has_pwrdn_delay attribute for USB-DP
PHY configuration and.
