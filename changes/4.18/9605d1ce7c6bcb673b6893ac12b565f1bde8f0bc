drm/i915/guc: Default to non-verbose GuC logging

Now that we've decoupled logging from relay, GuC log level is only
controlling the GuC behavior - there shouldn't be any impact on i915
behaviour. We're only going to see a single extra interrupt when log
will get half full.
That, and the fact that we're seeing igt/gem_exec_nop/basic-series
failing with non-verbose logging being disabled.

v2: Bring back the "auto" guc_log_level, now that we fixed the log
