fsnotify: generalize iteration of marks by object type

Make some code that handles marks of object types inode and vfsmount
generic, so it can handle other object types.

Introduce fsnotify_foreach_obj_type macro to iterate marks by object type
and fsnotify_iter_{should|set}_report_type macros to set/test report_mask.

This is going to be used for adding mark of another object type
(super block mark).
