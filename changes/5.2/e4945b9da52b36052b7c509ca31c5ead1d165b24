KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Add get/set accessors for the VP XIVE state

The state of the thread interrupt management registers needs to be
collected for migration. These registers are cached under the
'xive_saved_state.w01' field of the VCPU when the VPCU context is
pulled from the HW thread. An OPAL call retrieves the backup of the
IPB register in the underlying XIVE NVT structure and merges it in the
KVM state.
