fsnotify(): switch to passing const struct qstr * for file_name

Note that in fnsotify_move() and fsnotify_link() we are guaranteed
that dentry->d_name won't change during the fsnotify() evaluation
(by having the parent directory locked exclusive), so we don't
need to fetch dentry->d_name.name in the callers.  In fsnotify_dirent()
the same stability of dentry->d_name is also true, but it's a bit
more convoluted - there is one callchain (devpts_pty_new() ->
fsnotify_create() -> fsnotify_dirent()) where the parent is _not_
locked, but on devpts ->d_name of everything is unchanging; it
has neither explicit nor implicit renames.
