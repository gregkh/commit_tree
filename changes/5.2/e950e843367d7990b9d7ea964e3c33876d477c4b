selftests: bpf: test writable buffers in raw tps

This tests that:
  * a BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT_WRITABLE cannot be attached if it
    uses either:
    * a variable offset to the tracepoint buffer, or
    * an offset beyond the size of the tracepoint buffer
  * a tracer can modify the buffer provided when attached to a writable
    tracepoint in bpf_prog_test_run
