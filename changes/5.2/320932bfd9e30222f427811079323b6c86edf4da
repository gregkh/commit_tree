drm/amd/display: Recalculate pitch when buffers change

[Why]
Pitch was only calculated based on format whenever the plane state
was recreated. This could result in surface corruption due to the
incorrect pitch being programmed when the surface pitch changed during
commits where state->allow_modeset = false.

[How]
Recalculate pitch at the same time we update the buffer address and
other buffer attributes. This function was previously called
fill_plane_tiling_attributes but I've also renamed it to
fill_plane_buffer_attributes to clarify the actual intent of the
function now that it's handling most buffer related attributes.
