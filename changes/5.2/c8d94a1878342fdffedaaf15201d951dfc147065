tracing: Check keys for variable references in expressions too

There's an existing check for variable references in keys, but it
doesn't go far enough.  It checks whether a key field is a variable
reference but doesn't check whether it's an expression containing
variable references, which can cause the same problems for callers.

Use the existing field_has_hist_vars() function rather than a direct
top-level flag check to catch all possible variable references.
