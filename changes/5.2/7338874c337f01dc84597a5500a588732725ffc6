powerpc/mm: Fix crashes with hugepages & 4K pages

The recent commit to cleanup ifdefs in the hugepage initialisation led
to crashes when using 4K pages as reported by Sachin:

    do_page_fault+0x28/0x50
    handle_page_fault+0x18/0x38

This is caused by us trying to allocate from a NULL kmem cache in
__hugepte_alloc(). The kmem cache is NULL because it was never
allocated in hugetlbpage_init(), because add_huge_page_size() returned
an error.

The reason add_huge_page_size() returned an error is a simple typo, we
are calling check_and_get_huge_psize(size) when we should be passing
shift instead.

The fact that we're able to trigger this path when the kmem caches are
NULL is a separate bug, ie. we should not advertise any hugepage sizes
if we haven't setup the required caches for them.

This was only seen with 4K pages, with 64K pages we don't need to
allocate any extra kmem caches because the 16M hugepage just occupies
a single entry at the PMD level.
