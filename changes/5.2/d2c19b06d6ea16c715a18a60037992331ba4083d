drm/i915: Clean up ilk/icl pipe/output CSC programming

We have far too much messy duplicated code in the
pipe/output CSC programming. Simply provide two functions
(ilk_update_pipe_csc() and icl_update_output_csc()) to
program the relevant CSC registers. The desired offsets
and coefficients are passed in as parameters.
