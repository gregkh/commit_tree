ntp: Allow TAI-UTC offset to be set to zero

The ADJ_TAI adjtimex mode sets the TAI-UTC offset of the system clock.
It is typically set by NTP/PTP implementations and it is automatically
updated by the kernel on leap seconds. The initial value is zero (which
applications may interpret as unknown), but this value cannot be set by
adjtimex. This limitation seems to go back to the original "nanokernel"
implementation by David Mills.

Change the ADJ_TAI check to accept zero as a valid TAI-UTC offset in
order to allow setting it back to the initial value.
