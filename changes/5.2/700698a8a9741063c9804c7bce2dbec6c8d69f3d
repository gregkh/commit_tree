KVM: arm64/sve: sys_regs: Demote redundant vcpu_has_sve() checks to WARNs

Because of the logic in kvm_arm_sys_reg_{get,set}_reg() and
sve_id_visibility(), we should never call
{get,set}_id_aa64zfr0_el1() for a vcpu where !vcpu_has_sve(vcpu).

To avoid the code giving the impression that it is valid for these
functions to be called in this situation, and to help the compiler
make the right optimisation decisions, this patch adds WARN_ON()
for these cases.

Given the way the logic is spread out, this seems preferable to
dropping the checks altogether.
