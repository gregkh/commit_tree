net: sched: taprio: Remove should_restart_cycle()

The 'entry' argument from should_restart_cycle() cannot be NULL since it
is already checked by the caller so the WARN_ON() within should_
restart_cycle() could be removed.  By doing that, that function becomes
a dummy wrapper on list_is_last() so this patch simply gets rid of it
and call list_is_last() within advance_sched() instead.
