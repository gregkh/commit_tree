arm64: dts: sdm845: Include the interconnect resources DT header

Include the device tree header for the on-chip interconnect endpoint
resources on sdm845 devices. This will allow using the "interconnects"
property in DT nodes to describe the interconnect path resources they use.

The sdm845 interconnect provider DT node is already present, but the
header file with the resources is not included, so let's fix this.
