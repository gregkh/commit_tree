spi: work around clang bug in SPI_BPW_RANGE_MASK()

Clang-8 evaluates both sides of a ?: expression to check for
valid arithmetic even in the side that is never taken. This
results in a build warning:

drivers/spi/spi-sh-msiof.c:1052:24: error: shift count >= width of type [-Werror,-Wshift-count-overflow]
        .bits_per_word_mask = SPI_BPW_RANGE_MASK(8, 32),
                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change the implementation to use the GENMASK() macro that does
what we want here but does not have a problem with the shift
count overflow.
