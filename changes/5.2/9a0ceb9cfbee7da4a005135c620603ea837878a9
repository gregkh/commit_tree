s390: make chkbss work with clang

llvm skips an empty .bss section entirely, which makes
the check fail with an unexpected error:

/tmp/binutils-multi-test/bin/s390x-linux-gnu-objdump: section '.bss' mentioned in a -j option, but not found in any input file
error: arch/s390/boot/compressed/decompressor.o .bss section is not empty
../arch/s390/scripts/Makefile.chkbss:20: recipe for target 'arch/s390/boot/compressed/decompressor.o.chkbss' failed

Change the check so we first see if a .bss section exists
before trying to read its size.
