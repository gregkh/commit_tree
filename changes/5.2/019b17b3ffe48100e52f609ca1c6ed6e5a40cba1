x86/exceptions: Add structs for exception stacks

At the moment everything assumes a full linear mapping of the various
exception stacks. Adding guard pages to the cpu entry area mapping of the
exception stacks will break that assumption.

As a preparatory step convert both the real storage and the effective
mapping in the cpu entry area from character arrays to structures.

To ensure that both arrays have the same ordering and the same size of the
individual stacks fill the members with a macro. The guard size is the only
difference between the two resulting structures. For now both have guard
size 0 until the preparation of all usage sites is done.

Provide a couple of helper macros which are used in the following
conversions.
