block/ps3vram: Use %llu to format sector_t after LBDAF removal

The removal of CONFIG_LBDAF changed the type of sector_t from "unsigned
long" to "u64" aka "unsigned long long" on 64-bit platforms, leading to
a compiler warning regression:

    drivers/block/ps3vram.c: In function ‘ps3vram_probe’:
    drivers/block/ps3vram.c:770:23: warning: format ‘%lu’ expects argument of type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 4 has type ‘sector_t {aka long long unsigned int}’ [-Wformat=]

Fix this by using "%llu" instead.
