  kernel/sched/core.c:6670:6: warning: symbol 'tg_get_cfs_quota' was not declared. Should it be static?
  kernel/sched/core.c:6683:5: warning: symbol 'tg_set_cfs_period' was not declared. Should it be static?
  kernel/sched/core.c:6693:6: warning: symbol 'tg_get_cfs_period' was not declared. Should it be static?
  kernel/sched/fair.c:2596:6: warning: symbol 'task_tick_numa' was not declared. Should it be static?
