ASoC: soc-pcm: BE dai needs prepare when pause release after resume

If playback/capture is paused and system enters S3, after system returns
from suspend, BE dai needs to call prepare() callback when playback/capture
is released from pause if RESUME_INFO flag is not set.

Currently, the dpcm_be_dai_prepare() function will block calling prepare()
if the pcm is in SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_PAUSED state. This will cause the
following test case fail if the pcm uses BE:

playback -> pause -> S3 suspend -> S3 resume -> pause release

The playback may exit abnormally when pause is released because the BE dai
prepare() is not called.

This patch allows dpcm_be_dai_prepare() to call dai prepare() callback in
SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_PAUSED state.
