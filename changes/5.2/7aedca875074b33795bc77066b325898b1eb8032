ARM: dts: imx6q-logicpd: Reduce inrush current on USBH1

Some USB peripherals draw more power, and the sourcing regulator
take a little time to turn on.  This patch fixes an issue where
some devices occasionally do not get detected, because the power
isn't quite ready when communication starts, so we add a bit
of a delay.
