cfg80211: util: fix bit count off by one

The bits of Rx MCS Map in VHT capability were enumerated
with index transform - index i -> (i + 1) bit => nss i. BUG!
while it should be -   index i -> (i + 1) bit => (i + 1) nss.

The bug was exposed in commit a53b2a0b1245 ("iwlwifi: mvm: implement VHT
extended NSS support in rs.c"), where iwlwifi started using the
function.
