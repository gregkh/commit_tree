drm/vmwgfx: Use the dma scatter-gather iterator to get dma addresses

Use struct sg_dma_page_iter in favour struct of sg_page_iter, which fairly
recently was declared useless for obtaining dma addresses.

With a struct sg_dma_page_iter we can't call sg_page_iter_page() so
when the page is needed, use the same page lookup mechanism as for the
non-sg dma modes instead of calling sg_dma_page_iter.

Note, the fixes tag doesn't really point to a commit introducing a
failure / regression, but rather to a commit that implemented a simple
workaround for this problem.
