platform/chrome: Add support for v1 of host sleep event

Add support in code for the new forms of the host sleep event.
Detects the presence of this version of the command at runtime,
and use whichever form the EC supports. At this time, always
request the default timeout, and only report the failing response
via a WARN_ONCE(). Future versions could accept the sleep parameter
from outside the driver, and return the response information to
usermode or elsewhere.
