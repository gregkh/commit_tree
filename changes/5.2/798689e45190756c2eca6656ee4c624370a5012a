arm64: dts: rockchip: fix IO domain voltage setting of APIO5 on rockpro64

This patch fixes IO domain voltage setting that is related to
audio_gpio3d4a_ms (bit 1) of GRF_IO_VSEL.

This is because RockPro64 schematics P.16 says that regulator
supplies 3.0V power to APIO5_VDD. So audio_gpio3d4a_ms bit should
be clear (means 3.0V). Power domain map is saying different thing
(supplies 1.8V) but I believe P.16 is actual connectings.
