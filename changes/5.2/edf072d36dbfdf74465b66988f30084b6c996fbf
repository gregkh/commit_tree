arm64: Makefile: Replace -pg with CC_FLAGS_FTRACE

In preparation for arm64 supporting ftrace built on other compiler
options, let's have the arm64 Makefiles remove the $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE)
flags, whatever these may be, rather than assuming '-pg'.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
