mmc: alcor: enable DMA transfer of large buffers

DMA on this hardware is limited to dealing with a single page at a
time. Previously, the driver was set up accordingly to request single-page
DMA buffers, however that had the effect of generating a large number
of small MMC requests for data I/O.

Improve the driver to accept scatter-gather DMA buffers of larger sizes.
Iterate through those buffers a page at a time.

Testing with dd, this increases write performance from 2mb/sec to
10mb/sec, and increases read performance from 4mb/sec to 14mb/sec.
