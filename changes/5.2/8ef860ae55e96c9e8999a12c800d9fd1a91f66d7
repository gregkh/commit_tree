scsi: smartpqi: Reporting unhandled SCSI errors

When a HARDWARE_ERROR is triggered for ASC=0x3e, the existing code is only
considering the case where ASCQ=0x1.

According to the http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-num.htm#ASC_3E specification,
other values may occur like a timeout (ASCQ=0x2).

This patch prints an error message when a non-handled message is received.
This can help diagnose a possible misbehavior of the controller or a
missing implementation in the Linux kernel.

This patch keeps the exact same error handling but prints a message if an
ASCQ != 1 is reported.
