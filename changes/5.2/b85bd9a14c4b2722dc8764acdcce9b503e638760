rtw88: fix shift of more than 32 bits of a integer

Currently the shift of an integer value more than 32 bits can
occur when nss is more than 32.  Fix this by making the integer
constants unsigned long longs before shifting and bit-wise or'ing
with the u64 ra_mask to avoid the undefined shift behaviour.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Bad shift operation")
