mtd: spi-nor: Print all JEDEC ID bytes on error

If identification of an SPI NOR FLASH fails, the JEDEC ID is printed,
which is stored in the first 3 bytes of the ID read from the FLASH.
However, the extended JEDEC ID, which is stored in the remaining bytes,
also matters, as it is used for identification of some FLASH types.

Print all (currently 6) ID bytes read to ease failure analysis and
debugging.
