kbuild: check uniqueness of module names

In the recent build test of linux-next, Stephen saw a build error
caused by a broken .tmp_versions/*.mod file:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/13/991

drivers/net/phy/asix.ko and drivers/net/usb/asix.ko have the same
basename, and there is a race in generating .tmp_versions/asix.mod

Kbuild has not checked this before, and it suddenly shows up with
obscure error messages when this kind of race occurs.

Non-unique module names cause various sort of problems, but it is
not trivial to catch them by eyes.

Hence, this script.

It checks not only real modules, but also built-in modules (i.e.
controlled by tristate CONFIG option, but currently compiled with =y).
Non-unique names for built-in modules also cause problems because
/sys/modules/ would fall over.

For the latest kernel, I tested "make allmodconfig all" (or more
quickly "make allyesconfig modules"), and it detected the following:

warning: same basename if the following are built as modules:
  drivers/regulator/88pm800.ko
  drivers/mfd/88pm800.ko
