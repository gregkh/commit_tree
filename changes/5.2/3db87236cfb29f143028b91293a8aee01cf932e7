block: sed-opal: pass steps via argument rather than via opal_dev

The steps argument is only read by the next function, so it can
be passed directly as an argument rather than via opal_dev.

Normally, the steps is an array on the stack, so the pointer stops
being valid then the function that set opal_dev.steps returns.
If opal_dev.steps was not set to NULL before return it would become
a dangling pointer. When the steps are passed as argument this
becomes easier to see and more difficult to misuse.
