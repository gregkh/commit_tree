lwtunnel: Pass encap and encap type attributes to lwtunnel_fill_encap

Currently, lwtunnel_fill_encap hardcodes the encap and encap type
attributes as RTA_ENCAP and RTA_ENCAP_TYPE, respectively. The nexthop
objects want to re-use this code but the encap attributes passed to
userspace as NHA_ENCAP and NHA_ENCAP_TYPE. Since that is the only
difference, change lwtunnel_fill_encap to take the attribute type as
an input.
