crypto: ecc - make ecc into separate module

ecc.c have algorithms that could be used togeter by ecdh and ecrdsa.
Make it separate module. Add CRYPTO_ECC into Kconfig. EXPORT_SYMBOL and
document to what seems appropriate. Move structs ecc_point and ecc_curve
from ecc_curve_defs.h into ecc.h.

No code changes.
