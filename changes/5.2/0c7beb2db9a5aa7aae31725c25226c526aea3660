zd1211rw: use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace code of the following form:

sizeof(struct usb_req_write_regs) + count * sizeof(struct reg_data)

with:

struct_size(req, reg_writes, count)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
