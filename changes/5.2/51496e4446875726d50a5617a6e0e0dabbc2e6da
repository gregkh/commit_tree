pwm: meson: Consider 128 a valid pre-divider

The pre-divider allows configuring longer PWM periods compared to using
the input clock directly. The pre-divider is 7 bit wide, meaning it's
maximum value is 128 (the register value is off-by-one: 0x7f or 127).

Change the loop to also allow for the maximum possible value to be
considered valid.
