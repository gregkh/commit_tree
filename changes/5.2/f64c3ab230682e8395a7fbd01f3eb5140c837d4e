USB: serial: pl2303: fix tranceiver suspend mode

Add helper function to update register bits instead of overwriting the
entire control register when updating the flow-control settings.

This specifically avoids having the tranceiver suspend mode (bit 0)
depend on the flow control setting.

The tranceiver is currently configured at probe to be disabled during
suspend, but this was overridden when disabling flow control or enabling
xon/xoff.
