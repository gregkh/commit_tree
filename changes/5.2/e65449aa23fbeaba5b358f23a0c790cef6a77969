scsi: qla2xxx: Simplify qlt_send_term_imm_notif()

All qlt_send_term_imm_notif() callers pass '1' as second argument to this
function. Hence remove the (broken) code that depends on that second
argument having another value. Add a pr_debug() statement that prints rc to
avoid that the compiler would complain that rc has been set but is not
used.
