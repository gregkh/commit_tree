crypto: scompress - initialize per-CPU variables on each CPU

In commit 71052dcf4be70 ("crypto: scompress - Use per-CPU struct instead
multiple variables") I accidentally initialized multiple times the memory on a
random CPU. I should have initialize the memory on every CPU like it has
been done earlier. I didn't notice this because the scheduler didn't
move the task to another CPU.
Guenter managed to do that and the code crashed as expected.

Allocate / free per-CPU memory on each CPU.
