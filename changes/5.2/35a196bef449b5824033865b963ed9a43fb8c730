proc: prevent changes to overridden credentials

Prevent userspace from changing the the /proc/PID/attr values if the
task's credentials are currently overriden.  This not only makes sense
conceptually, it also prevents some really bizarre error cases caused
when trying to commit credentials to a task with overridden
credentials.
