SMB3: Clean up query symlink when reparse point

Two of the common symlink formats use reparse points
(unlike mfsymlinks and also unlike the SMB1 posix
extensions).  This is the first part of the fixes
to allow these reparse points (NFS style and Windows
symlinks) to be resolved properly as symlinks by the
client.
