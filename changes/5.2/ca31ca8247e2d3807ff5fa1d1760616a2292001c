tools/bpf: fix perf build error with uClibc (seen on ARC)

When build perf for ARC recently, there was a build failure due to lack
of __NR_bpf.

| Auto-detecting system features:
|
| ...                     get_cpuid: [ OFF ]
| ...                           bpf: [ on  ]
|
| #  error __NR_bpf not defined. libbpf does not support your arch.
    ^~~~~
| bpf.c: In function 'sys_bpf':
| bpf.c:66:17: error: '__NR_bpf' undeclared (first use in this function)
|  return syscall(__NR_bpf, cmd, attr, size);
|                 ^~~~~~~~
|                 sys_bpf
