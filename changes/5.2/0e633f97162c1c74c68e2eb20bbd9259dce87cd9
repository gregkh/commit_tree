media: davinci-isif: avoid uninitialized variable use

clang warns about a possible variable use that gcc never
complained about:

drivers/media/platform/davinci/isif.c:982:32: error: variable 'frame_size' is uninitialized when used here
      [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
                dm365_vpss_set_pg_frame_size(frame_size);
                                             ^~~~~~~~~~
drivers/media/platform/davinci/isif.c:887:2: note: variable 'frame_size' is declared here
        struct vpss_pg_frame_size frame_size;
        ^
1 error generated.

There is no initialization for this variable at all, and there
has never been one in the mainline kernel, so we really should
not put that stack data into an mmio register.

On the other hand, I suspect that gcc checks the condition
more closely and notices that the global
isif_cfg.bayer.config_params.test_pat_gen flag is initialized
to zero and never written to from any code path, so anything
depending on it can be eliminated.

To shut up the clang warning, just remove the dead code manually,
it has probably never been used because any attempt to do so
would have resulted in undefined behavior.
