i40e: Implement DDP support in i40e driver

This patch introduces DDP (Dynamic Device Personalization) which allows
loading profiles that change the way internal parser interprets processed
frames. To load DDP profiles it utilizes ethtool flash feature. The files
with recipes must be located in /var/lib/firmware directory. Afterwards
the recipe can be loaded by invoking:

    ethtool -f <if_name> <file_name> 100
    ethtool -f <if_name> - 100

See further details of this feature in the i40e documentation, or

The driver shall verify DDP profile can be loaded in accordance with
the rules:
* Package with Group ID 0 are exclusive and can only be loaded the first.
* Packages with Group ID 0x01-0xFE can only be loaded simultaneously
   with the packages from the same group.
* Packages with Group ID 0xFF are compatible with all other packages.
