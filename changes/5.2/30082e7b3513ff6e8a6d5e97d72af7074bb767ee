ARM: dts: exynos: Adjust ldo23 and ldo27 to lower levels on Arndale Octa

Although on the schematics of Insignal Arndale Octa board the
PVDD_MIFS_1V1 (ldo23) and PVDD_G3DS_1V0 (ldo27) are marked as 1.2 V, the
vendor v3.4 Android kernel sets them lower.  Also name suggests that
they should work on 1.1 V and 1.0 V respectively, not 1.2 V.
