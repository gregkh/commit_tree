net: sched: flower: refactor fl_change

As a preparation for using classifier spinlock instead of relying on
external rtnl lock, rearrange code in fl_change. The goal is to group the
code which changes classifier state in single block in order to allow
following commits in this set to protect it from parallel modification with
tp->lock. Data structures that require tp->lock protection are mask
hashtable and filters list, and classifier handle_idr.

fl_hw_replace_filter() is a sleeping function and cannot be called while
holding a spinlock. In order to execute all sequence of changes to shared
classifier data structures atomically, call fl_hw_replace_filter() before
modifying them.
