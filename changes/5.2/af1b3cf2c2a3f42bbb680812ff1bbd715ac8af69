arm64: compat: Add KUSER_HELPERS config option

When kuser helpers are enabled the kernel maps the relative code at
a fixed address (0xffff0000). Making configurable the option to disable
them means that the kernel can remove this mapping and any access to
this memory area results in a sigfault.

Add a KUSER_HELPERS config option that can be used to disable the
mapping when it is turned off.

This option can be turned off if and only if the applications are
designed specifically for the platform and they do not make use of the
kuser helpers code.
