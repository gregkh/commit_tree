libbpf: don't fail when feature probing fails

Otherwise libbpf is unusable from unprivileged process with
kernel.kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1.
All I get is EPERM from the probes, even if I just want to
open an ELF object and look at what progs/maps it has.

Instead of dying on probes, let's just pr_debug the error and
try to continue.
