btrfs: tree-checker: Check chunk item at tree block read time

Since we have btrfs_check_chunk_valid() in tree-checker, let's do
chunk item verification in tree-checker too.

Since the tree-checker is run at endio time, if one chunk leaf fails
chunk verification, we can still retry the other copy, making btrfs more
robust to fuzzed image as we may still get a good chunk item.

Also since we have done chunk verification in tree block read time, skip
the btrfs_check_chunk_valid() call in read_one_chunk() if we're reading
chunk items from leaf.
