drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Add quirk for GPD MicroPC

GPD has done it again, make a nice device (good), use way too generic
DMI strings (bad) and use a portrait screen rotated 90 degrees (ugly).

Because of the too generic DMI strings this entry is also doing bios-date
matching, so the gpd_micropc data struct may very well need to be updated
with some extra bios-dates in the future.
