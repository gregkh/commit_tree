btrfs: Introduce fs_info to extent_io_tree

This patch will add a new member fs_info to extent_io_tree.

This provides the basis for later trace events to distinguish the output
between different btrfs filesystems. While this increases the size of
the structure, we want to know the source of the trace events and
passing the fs_info as an argument to all contexts is not possible.

The selftests are now allowed to set it to NULL as they don't use the
tracepoints.
