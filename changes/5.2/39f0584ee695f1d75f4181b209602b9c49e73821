x86/mce: Remove mce_report_event()

Calling this function has been wrong for a while now:

* Can't call schedule_work() in #MC context.

* mce_notify_irq() either.

* None of that noodling is needed anymore - all it needs to do is kick
the IRQ work which would self-IPI so that once the #MC handler is done,
the work queue will run and process queued MCE records.

So remove it.
