drm/i915/gvt: emit init breadcrumb for gvt request

"To track whether a request has started on HW, we can emit a breadcrumb at
the beginning of the request and check its timeline's HWSP to see if the
breadcrumb has advanced past the start of this request." It means all the
request which timeline's has_init_breadcrumb is true, then the
emit_init_breadcrumb process must have before emitting the real commands,
otherwise, the scheduler might get a wrong state of this request during
reset. If the request is exactly the guilty one, the scheduler won't
terminate it with the wrong state. To avoid this, do emit_init_breadcrumb
for all the requests from gvt.
