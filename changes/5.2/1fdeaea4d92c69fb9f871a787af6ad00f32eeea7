xfs: abort unaligned nowait directio early

Dave Chinner noticed that xfs_file_dio_aio_write returns EAGAIN without
dropping the IOLOCK when its deciding not to wait, which means that we
leak the IOLOCK there.  Since we now make unaligned directio always
wait, we have the opportunity to bail out before trying to take the
lock, which should reduce the overhead of this never-gonna-work case
considerably while also solving the dropped lock problem.
