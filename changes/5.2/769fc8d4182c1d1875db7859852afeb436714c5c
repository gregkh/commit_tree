regulator: ltc3676: Fix notifier mutex lock warning

The mutex for the regulator_dev must be controlled by the caller of
the regulator_notifier_call_chain(), as described in the comment
for that function.

Failure to mutex lock and unlock surrounding the notifier call results
in a kernel WARN_ON_ONCE() which will dump a backtrace for the
regulator_notifier_call_chain() when that function call is first made.
The mutex can be controlled using the regulator_lock/unlock() API.
