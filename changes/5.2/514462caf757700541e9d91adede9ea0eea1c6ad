drm/i915: Add 10bit LUT for ilk/snb

Plop in support for 10bit LUT on ilk/snb.

There is no split gamma mode on these platforms, so we have
to choose between degamma and gamma. That could be a runtime choice
but for now let's just advertize the gamma as having 1024 entries.
We'll also keep the ctm hidden for now.

v2: Don't use I915_WRITE_FW() yet
    Introduce bool has_ctm (Maarten)
    Call drm_crtc_enable_color_mgmt() uncoditionally (Maarten)
