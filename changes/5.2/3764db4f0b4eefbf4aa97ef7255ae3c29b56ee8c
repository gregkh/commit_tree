ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: Add missing CPU clock references

A83T DTSI has cpu clocks defined only on the first CPU in each cluster.
We can bring down any CPU in the cluster, so we need to define clock
for each CPU, so that the system knows what clock to use if the first
CPU is down.

Also move the clocks property below the compatible on cpus where it is
already defined. Property "clock-names" is not needed.
