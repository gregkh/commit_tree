dmaengine: tegra210-adma: Fix channel FIFO configuration

Commit ded1f3db4cd6 ("dmaengine: tegra210-adma: prepare for supporting
newer Tegra chips") removed the default settings DMA channel RX and TX
FIFO sizes and this is breaking DMA transfers. The intention was to
move the default settings to the chip specific data structure because
this commit was preparing for adding support for Tegra186 where the
fields for the FIFO CTRL register are slightly different.

Fix the configuration of the FIFO sizes by adding default values for
the FIFO CTRL register for both Tegra210 and Tegra186 and store the
values in the chip specific structure.
