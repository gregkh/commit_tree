drm/amd/display: Make stream commits call into DC only once

[Why]
dc_commit_updates_for_stream is called twice per stream: once
with the flip data and once will all other data. This causes
problems when these DC calls have different numbers of planes

For example, a commit with a pageflip on plane A and a
non-pageflip change on plane B will first call
into DC with just plane A, causing plane B to be
disabled. Then it will call into DC with both planes,
re-enabling plane B

[How]
Merge flip and full into a single bundle

Apart from the single DC call, the logic should not be
changed by this patch
