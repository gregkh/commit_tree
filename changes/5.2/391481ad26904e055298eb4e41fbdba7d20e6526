iwlwifi: dbg: replace dump info device family with HW type

In the dump info, the driver sets device_family to
IWL_FW_ERROR_DUMP_FAMILY_7 in case IWL_FW_ERROR_DUMP_FAMILY_7 is used or
IWL_FW_ERROR_DUMP_FAMILY_8 otherwise. This information is misleading and
incorrect since the driver sets the device family to 8 to any device that
is from family 8 and later, e.g. device family 9 is represented as 8 in
the dump.
Also, the device family enum is known only to the driver and
does not give any information to the FW developer

Change the device family to HW type to give propper data about the nic
in use.
