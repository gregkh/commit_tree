drm/arm/malidp: Specified the rotation memory requirements for AFBC YUV formats

The newly supported AFBC YUV formats have the following rotation memory
constraints (in DP550/DP650).
1. DRM_FORMAT_VUY888/DRM_FORMAT_VUY101010 :- It can rotate upto 8
horizontal lines in the AFBC output buffer.
2. DRM_FORMAT_YUV420_8BIT :- It can rotate upto 16 horizontal lines
in the AFBC output buffer.

Also some of the pixel formats are specified in bits per pixel (rather
than bytes per pixel), so the calculation needs to take note of this.

Besides there are some difference between DP550 and DP650 and these are
as follows:-
1. DRM_FORMAT_X0L2 (in uncompressed format) does not support rotation in
DP550. For DP650, it can rotate upto 16 horizontal lines in the AFBC
output buffer, whereas in DP550 (with AFBC), it can rotate upto 8
horizontal lines.
2. DRM_FORMAT_YUV420_10BIT :- It can rotate upto 8 horizontal lines in
dp550 and 16 horizontal lines in DP650.

Changes since v3 (series):
- Added the ack
- Rebased on the latest drm-misc-next
