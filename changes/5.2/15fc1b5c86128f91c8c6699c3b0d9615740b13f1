Revert "HID: Increase maximum report size allowed by hid_field_extract()"

This reverts commit 94a9992f7dbdfb28976b565af220e0c4a117144a.

The commit allows for more than 32 bits in hid_field_extract(),
but the return value is a 32 bits int.
So basically what this commit is doing is just silencing those
legitimate errors.

Revert to a previous situation in the hope that a proper
fix will be impletemented.
