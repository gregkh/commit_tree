nvme-fc: use separate work queue to avoid warning

When tearing down a controller the following warning is issued:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 30681 at ../kernel/workqueue.c:2418 check_flush_dependency

This happens as the err_work workqueue item is scheduled on the
system workqueue (which has WQ_MEM_RECLAIM not set), but is flushed
from a workqueue which has WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set.

Fix this by providing an FC-NVMe specific workqueue.
