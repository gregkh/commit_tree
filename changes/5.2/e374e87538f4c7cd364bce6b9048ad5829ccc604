mmc: sdhci_am654: Clear HISPD_ENA in some lower speed modes

According to the AM654x Data Manual[1], the setup timing in lower speed
modes can only be met if the controller uses a falling edge data launch.

To ensure this, the HIGH_SPEED_ENA (HOST_CONTROL[2]) bit should be
cleared in default speed, SD high speed, MMC high speed, SDR12 and SDR25
speed modes.

Use the sdhci writeb callback to implement this condition.
