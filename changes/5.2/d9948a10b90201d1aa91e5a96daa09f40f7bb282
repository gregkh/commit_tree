drm/i915: Remove second level open-coded rcu work

We currently use a worker queued from an rcu callback to determine when
a how grace period has elapsed while we remained idle. We use this idle
delay to infer that we will be idle for a while and this is a suitable
point at which we can trim our global memory caches.

Since we wrote that, this mechanism now exists as rcu_work, and having
converted the idle shrinkers over to using that, we can remove our own
variant.

v2: Say goodbye to gt.epoch as well.
v3: Remove the misplaced and redundant comment before parking globals
