mm/hibernation: Make hibernation handle unmapped pages

Make hibernate handle unmapped pages on the direct map when
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SET_ALIAS=y is set. These functions allow for setting pages
to invalid configurations, so now hibernate should check if the pages have
valid mappings and handle if they are unmapped when doing a hibernate
save operation.

Previously this checking was already done when CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y
was configured. It does not appear to have a big hibernating performance
impact. The speed of the saving operation before this change was measured
as 819.02 MB/s, and after was measured at 813.32 MB/s.
