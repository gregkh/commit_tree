arm64: errata: Add workaround for Cortex-A76 erratum #1463225

Revisions of the Cortex-A76 CPU prior to r4p0 are affected by an erratum
that can prevent interrupts from being taken when single-stepping.

This patch implements a software workaround to prevent userspace from
effectively being able to disable interrupts.
