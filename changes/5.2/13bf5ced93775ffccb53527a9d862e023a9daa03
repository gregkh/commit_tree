dma-mapping: add a Kconfig symbol to indicate arch_dma_prep_coherent presence

Add a Kconfig symbol that indicates an architecture provides a
arch_dma_prep_coherent implementation, and provide a stub otherwise.

This will allow the generic dma-iommu code to use it while still
allowing to be built for cache coherent architectures.
