MAINTAINERS: Add Ulf Hansson to the MEMORYSTICK section

The amount of changes to the memorystick subsystem are limited as of today.
However, I have a couple of times been funneling changes through my MMC
tree and it have turned out fine. So, I am here by volunteering to continue
doing this, by adding myself and the link to the MMC tree to the MEMSTICK
section.
