scsi: scsi_transport_fc: nvme: display FC-NVMe port roles

Currently the FC-NVMe driver is leverating the SCSI FC transport class to
access the remote ports. Which means that all FC-NVMe remote ports will be
visible to the fc transport layer, but due to missing definitions the port
roles will always be 'unknown'.  This patch adds the missing definitions to
the fc transport class to that the port roles are correctly displayed.
