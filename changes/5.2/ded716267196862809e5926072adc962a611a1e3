media: hfi_parser: don't trick gcc with a wrong expected size

Smatch warns about small size on two structs:

	drivers/media/platform/qcom/venus/hfi_parser.c:103 parse_profile_level() error: memcpy() 'proflevel' too small (8 vs 128)
	drivers/media/platform/qcom/venus/hfi_parser.c: drivers/media/platform/qcom/venus/hfi_parser.c:129 parse_caps() error: memcpy() 'cap' too small (16 vs 512)

The reason is that the hfi_parser actually expects:
    - multiple data entries on hfi_capabilities
    - multiple profile_level on hfi_profile_level_supported

However, the structs trick gcc, making it to believe that
there's just one value for each.
