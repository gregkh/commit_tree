bcache: move definition of 'int ret' out of macro read_bucket()

'int ret' is defined as a local variable inside macro read_bucket().
Since this macro is called multiple times, and following patches will
use a 'int ret' variable in bch_journal_read(), this patch moves
definition of 'int ret' from macro read_bucket() to range of function
bch_journal_read().
