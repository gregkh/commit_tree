Commit ca84d1a24 (KVM: x86: Add clock sync request to hardware enable) mentioned
that "we always hold kvm_lock when hardware_enable is called.  The one place that
doesn't need to worry about it is resume, as resuming a frozen CPU, the spinlock
won't be taken." However, commit 6706dae9 (virt/kvm: Replace spin_is_locked() with
lockdep) introduces a bug, it asserts when the lock is not held which is contrary
to the original goal.

This patch fixes it by WARN_ON when the lock is held.
