tty: Don't force RISCV SBI console as preferred console

The Linux kernel will auto-disables all boot consoles whenever it
gets a preferred real console.

Currently on RISC-V systems, if we have a real console which is not
RISCV SBI console then boot consoles (such as earlycon=sbi) are not
auto-disabled when a real console (ttyS0 or ttySIF0) is available.
This results in duplicate prints at boot-time after kernel starts
using real console (i.e. ttyS0 or ttySIF0) if "earlycon=" kernel
parameter was passed by bootloader.

The reason for above issue is that RISCV SBI console always adds
itself as preferred console which is causing other real consoles
to be not used as preferred console.

Ideally "console=" kernel parameter passed by bootloaders should
be the one selecting a preferred real console.

This patch fixes above issue by not forcing RISCV SBI console as
preferred console.
