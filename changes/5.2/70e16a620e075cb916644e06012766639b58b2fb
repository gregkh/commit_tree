kobject: clean up the kobject add documentation a bit more

Commit 1fd7c3b438a2 ("kobject: Improve doc clarity kobject_init_and_add()")
tried to provide more clarity, but the reference to kobject_del() was
incorrect.  Fix that up by removing that line, and hopefully be more explicit
as to exactly what needs to happen here once you register a kobject with the
kobject core.
