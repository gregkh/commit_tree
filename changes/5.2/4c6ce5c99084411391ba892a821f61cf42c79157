drm/i915: Move the decision to use the breadcrumb tasklet to the backend

Use the engine->flags to store whether we want to kick the submission
tasklet on receipt of a breadcrumb interrupt, so that this decision can
be made by the submission backend and not dependent on a limited feature
test within the interrupt handler. This should make it easier to adapt to
different submission backends.
