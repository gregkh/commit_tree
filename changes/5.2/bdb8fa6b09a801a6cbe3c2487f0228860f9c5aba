ASoC: mediatek: mt6358: initialize setting when ramping volume

Mt6358 ramps up from the smallest volume (i.e. -10dB) to target dB when
opening and ramps down from target dB to mute (i.e. -40dB) when closing.
If target is equal to -10dB when opening, headset_volume_ramp() simply
leaves current setting (which may not be -10dB) unchanged.

Execute the loop at least once to initialize the setting to the
starting point (i.e. from).
