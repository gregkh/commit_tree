netfilter: ipv6: nf_defrag: accept duplicate fragments again

When fixing the skb leak introduced by the conversion to rbtree, I
forgot about the special case of duplicate fragments. The condition
under the 'insert_error' label isn't effective anymore as
nf_ct_frg6_gather() doesn't override the returned value anymore. So
duplicate fragments now get NF_DROP verdict.

To accept duplicate fragments again, handle them specially as soon as
inet_frag_queue_insert() reports them. Return -EINPROGRESS which will
translate to NF_STOLEN verdict, like any accepted fragment. However,
such packets don't carry any new information and aren't queued, so we
just drop them immediately.
