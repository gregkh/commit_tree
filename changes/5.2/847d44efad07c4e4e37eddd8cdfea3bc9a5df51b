net: bridge: update multicast stats from maybe_deliver()

Simplify this code by updating bridge multicast stats from
maybe_deliver().

Note that commit 6db6f0eae605 ("bridge: multicast to unicast"), in case
the port flag BR_MULTICAST_TO_UNICAST is set, never updates the previous
port pointer, therefore it is always going to be different from the
existing port in this deduplicated list iteration.
