ALSA: hda/realtek - EAPD turn on later

Let EAPD turn on after set pin output.

[ NOTE: This change is supposed to reduce the possible click noises at
  (runtime) PM resume.  The functionality should be same (i.e. the
  verbs are executed correctly) no matter which order is, so this
  should be safe to apply for all codecs -- tiwai ]
