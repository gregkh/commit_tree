net: hsr: Fix node prune function for forget time expiry

HSR should forget nodes after configured node forget time expiry based
on HSR_NODE_FORGET_TIME. As part of hsr_prune_nodes(), code checks to
see if entries are to be flushed out if not heard for longer than forget
time. But currently hsr_prune_nodes() is called only once during device
creation. Restart the timer at the end of hsr_prune_nodes() so that
hsr_prune_nodes() gets called periodically and forgotten entries are
removed from node table.
