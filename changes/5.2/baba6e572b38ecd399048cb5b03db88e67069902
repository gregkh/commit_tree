drm/i915: take a reference to uncore in the engine and use it

A few advantages:

- Prepares us for the planned split of display uncore from GT uncore

- Improves our engine-centric view of the world in the engine code
  and allows us to avoid jumping back to dev_priv.

- Allows us to wrap accesses to engine register in nice macros that
  automatically pick the right mmio base.
