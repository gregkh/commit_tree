powerpc/mm: Fix build error with FLATMEM book3s64 config

The current value of MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS cannot work with 32 bit configs.
We used to have MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS not defined without SPARSEMEM and 32
bit configs never expected a value to be set for MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS.

Dependent code such as zsmalloc derived the right values based on other
fields. Instead of finding a value that works with different configs,
use new values only for book3s_64. For 64 bit booke, use the definition
of MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS as per commit a7df61a0e2b6 ("[PATCH] ppc64: Increase sparsemem defaults")
That change was done in 2005 and hopefully will work with book3e 64.
