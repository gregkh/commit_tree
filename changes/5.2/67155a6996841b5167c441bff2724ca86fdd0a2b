drm/i915: Don't pass plane state to skl_compute_plane_wm()

skl_compute_plane_wm() doesn't actually need the plane state. While
it would make logically sense to pass it, we shall need to reuse
skl_compute_plane_wm() to compute the minimum ddb allocation for
the cursor before the cursor may be enabled. Thus we can't rely
on the plane state. The alternative would be to duplicate a lot of
the wm calculations for the cursor ddb allocation case, which doens't
appeal to me.
