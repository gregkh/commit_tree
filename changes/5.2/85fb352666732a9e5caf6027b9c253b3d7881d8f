drm/sun4i: dsi: Restrict DSI tcon clock divider

The current code allows the TCON clock divider to have a range between 4
and 127 when feeding the DSI controller.

The only display supported so far had a display clock rate that ended up
using a divider of 4, but testing with other displays show that only 4
seems to be functional.

This also aligns with what Allwinner is doing in their BSP, so let's just
hardcode that we want a divider of 4 when using the DSI output.
