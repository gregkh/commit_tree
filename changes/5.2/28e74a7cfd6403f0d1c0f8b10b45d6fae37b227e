net: sfp: read eeprom in maximum 16 byte increments

Some SFP modules do not like reads longer than 16 bytes, so read the
EEPROM in chunks of 16 bytes at a time.  This behaviour is not specified
in the SFP MSAs, which specifies:

 "The serial interface uses the 2-wire serial CMOS E2PROM protocol
  defined for the ATMEL AT24C01A/02/04 family of components."

and

 "As long as the SFP+ receives an acknowledge, it shall serially clock
  out sequential data words. The sequence is terminated when the host
  responds with a NACK and a STOP instead of an acknowledge."

We must avoid breaking a read across a 16-bit quantity in the diagnostic
page, thankfully all 16-bit quantities in that page are naturally
aligned.
