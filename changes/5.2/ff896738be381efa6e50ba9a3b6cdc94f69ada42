block: return from __bio_try_merge_page if merging occured in the same page

We currently have an input same_page parameter to __bio_try_merge_page
to prohibit merging in the same page.  The rationale for that is that
some callers need to account for every page added to a bio.  Instead of
letting these callers call twice into the merge code to account for the
new vs existing page cases, just turn the paramter into an output one that
returns if a merge in the same page occured and let them act accordingly.
