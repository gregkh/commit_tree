drm/amd/display: Handle branch device with DFP count = 0 case.

[Why]
When you have a SST branch device the driver, Even no sink device connected,
it also send HPD with a valid EDID. Driver will config it to DP sink.
Therefore, there're two displays in display setting.

DPCD 0x05, DFP_PRESENT = 1 (branch device),
DFP_TYPE = 00 (Display Port)

[How]
Driver determine DPCD 0x05 DFP_PRESENT = 1(branch) as an active dongle
And check DFP count.
