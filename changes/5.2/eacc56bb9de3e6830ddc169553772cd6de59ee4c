KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Introduce a new capability KVM_CAP_PPC_IRQ_XIVE

The user interface exposes a new capability KVM_CAP_PPC_IRQ_XIVE to
let QEMU connect the vCPU presenters to the XIVE KVM device if
required. The capability is not advertised for now as the full support
for the XIVE native exploitation mode is not yet available. When this
is case, the capability will be advertised on PowerNV Hypervisors
only. Nested guests (pseries KVM Hypervisor) are not supported.

Internally, the interface to the new KVM device is protected with a
new interrupt mode: KVMPPC_IRQ_XIVE.
