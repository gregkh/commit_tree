doc: mm: migration doesn't use FOLL_SPLIT anymore

When demonstrating FOLL_SPLIT in transhuge document, migration is used
as an example.  But, since commit 94723aafb9e7 ("mm: unclutter THP
migration"), the way of THP migration is totally changed.  FOLL_SPLIT is
not used by migration anymore due to the change.

Remove the obsolete example to avoid confusion.
