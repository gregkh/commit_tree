cpufreq: intel_pstate: Update max frequency on global turbo changes

While the cpuinfo.max_freq value doesn't really matter for
intel_pstate in the active mode, in the passive mode it is used by
governors as the maximum physical frequency of the CPU and the
results of governor computations generally depend on it.  Also it
is made available to user space via sysfs and it should match the
current HW configuration.

For this reason, make intel_pstate update cpuinfo.max_freq for all
CPUs if it detects a global change of turbo frequency settings from
"disable" to "enable" or the other way associated with a _PPC change
notification from the platform firmware.

Note that policy_is_inactive(),  cpufreq_cpu_acquire(),
cpufreq_cpu_release(), and cpufreq_set_policy() need to be made
available to it for this purpose.
