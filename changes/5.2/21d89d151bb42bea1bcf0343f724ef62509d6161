mm: memcontrol: push down mem_cgroup_nr_lru_pages()

mem_cgroup_nr_lru_pages() is just a convenience wrapper around
memcg_page_state() that takes bitmasks of lru indexes and aggregates the
counts for those.

Replace callsites where the bitmask is simple enough with direct
memcg_page_state() call(s).
