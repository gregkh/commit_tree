EDAC, skx, i10nm: Make skx_common.c a pure library

The following Kconfig constellations fail randconfig builds:

  CONFIG_ACPI_NFIT=y
  CONFIG_EDAC_DEBUG=y
  CONFIG_EDAC_SKX=m
  CONFIG_EDAC_I10NM=y

or

  CONFIG_ACPI_NFIT=y
  CONFIG_EDAC_DEBUG=y
  CONFIG_EDAC_SKX=y
  CONFIG_EDAC_I10NM=m

with:
  ...
  CC [M]  drivers/edac/skx_common.o
  ...
  .../skx_common.o:.../skx_common.c:672: undefined reference to `__this_module'

That is because if one of the two drivers - skx_edac or i10nm_edac - is
built-in and the other one is a module, the shared file skx_common.c
gets linked into a module object by kbuild. Therefore, when linking that
same file into vmlinux, the '__this_module' symbol used in debugfs isn't
defined, leading to the above error.

Fix it by moving all debugfs code from skx_common.c to both skx_base.c
and i10nm_base.c respectively. Thus, skx_common.c doesn't refer to the
'__this_module' symbol anymore.

Clarify skx_common.c's purpose at the top of the file for future
reference, while at it.
