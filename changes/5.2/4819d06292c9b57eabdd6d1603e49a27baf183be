ASoC: simple-card: Restore original configuration of DAI format

Revert commit 069d037aea98 ("ASoC: simple-card: Fix configuration of
DAI format"). During further review, it turns out that the actual issue
was caused by an incorrectly formatted device-tree node describing the
soundcard.

The following is incorrect because the simple-audio-card
'bitclock-master' and 'frame-master' properties should not reference the
actual codec phandle ...

	sound {
		compatible = "simple-audio-card";
		...
	=>	simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&codec>;
	=>	simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&codec>;
		...

		simple-audio-card,cpu {
			sound-dai = <&xxx>;
		};

		simple-audio-card,codec {
	=>		sound-dai = <&codec>;
		};
	};

Rather, these properties should reference the phandle to the
'simple-audio-card,codec' property as shown below ...

	sound {
		compatible = "simple-audio-card";
		...
	=>	simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&codec>;
	=>	simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&codec>;
		...

		simple-audio-card,cpu {
			sound-dai = <&xxx>;
		};

	=>	codec: simple-audio-card,codec { /* simple-card wants here */
			sound-dai = <&xxx>;	 /* not here */
		};
	};
