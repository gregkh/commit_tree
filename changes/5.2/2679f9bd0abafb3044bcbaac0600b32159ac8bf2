powerpc/8xx: Add Kernel Userspace Access Protection

This patch adds Kernel Userspace Access Protection on the 8xx.

When a page is RO or RW, it is set RO or RW for Key 0 and NA
for Key 1.

Up to now, the User group is defined with Key 0 for both User and
Supervisor.

By changing the group to Key 0 for User and Key 1 for Supervisor,
this patch prevents the Kernel from being able to access user data.

At exception entry, the kernel saves SPRN_MD_AP in the regs struct,
and reapply the protection. At exception exit it restores SPRN_MD_AP
with the value saved on exception entry.
