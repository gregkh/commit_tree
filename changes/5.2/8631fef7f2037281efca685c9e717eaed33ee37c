drm/i915/gvt: Revert "drm/i915/gvt: Refine the snapshort range of I915 MCHBAR to optimize gvt-g boot time"

This reverts commit f74a6d9a2c427b6656bc93eacfa6d329ba54d611.

BXT needs to access 0x141000-0x1417ff register to obtain the dram info.
But after the snapshot range of I915_MCHBAR is refined in f74a6d9a2c,
it only initializes the range of 0x144000-0x147fff for VGPU and then
causes that the guest GPU can't get the initialized value for dram
detection on BXT.
