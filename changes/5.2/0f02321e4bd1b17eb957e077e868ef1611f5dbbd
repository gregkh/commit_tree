USB: cdc-acm: clean up throttle handling

Clean up the throttle implementation by dropping the redundant
throttle_req flag which was a remnant from back when USB serial had only
a single read URB, something which was later carried over to cdc-acm.

Also convert the throttled flag to an atomic bit flag.
