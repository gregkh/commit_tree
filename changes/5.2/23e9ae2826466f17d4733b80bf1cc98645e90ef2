dt-bindings: clock: meson8b: drop the "ABP" clock definition

Commit 8e1dd17c8b0e3f ("dt-bindings: clock: meson8b: export the CPU post
dividers") added a new clock ID "CLKID_ABP" which contains a typo. This
was fixed by adding a new (typo-free) #define CLKID_APB in
commit 40d08f774c17ad ("dt-bindings: clock: meson8b: add APB clock
definition").
Now that the new #define is used by the driver we can remove the old
one (because the old one is not used anywhere).
