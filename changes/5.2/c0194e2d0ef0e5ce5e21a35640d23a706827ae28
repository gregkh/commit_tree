net/mlx5e: Disable rxhash when CQE compress is enabled

When CQE compression is enabled (Multi-host systems), compressed CQEs
might arrive to the driver rx, compressed CQEs don't have a valid hash
offload and the driver already reports a hash value of 0 and invalid hash
type on the skb for compressed CQEs, but this is not good enough.

On a congested PCIe, where CQE compression will kick in aggressively,
gro will deliver lots of out of order packets due to the invalid hash
and this might cause a serious performance drop.

The only valid solution, is to disable rxhash offload at all when CQE
compression is favorable (Multi-host systems).
