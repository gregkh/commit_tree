HID: logitech-hidpp: use RAP instead of FAP to get the protocol version

According to the logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf doc:
https://lekensteyn.nl/files/logitech/logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf

We should use a register-access-protocol request using the short input /
output report ids. This is necessary because 27MHz HID++ receivers have
a max-packetsize on their HIP++ endpoint of 8, so they cannot support
long reports. Using a feature-access-protocol request (which is always
long or very-long) with these will cause a timeout error, followed by
the hidpp driver treating the device as not being HID++ capable.

This commit fixes this by switching to using a rap request to get the
protocol version.

Besides being tested with a (046d:c517) 27MHz receiver with various
27MHz keyboards and mice, this has also been tested to not cause
regressions on a non-unifying dual-HID++ nano receiver (046d:c534) with
k270 and m185 HID++-2.0 devices connected and on a unifying/dj receiver
(046d:c52b) with a HID++-2.0 Logitech Rechargeable Touchpad T650.
