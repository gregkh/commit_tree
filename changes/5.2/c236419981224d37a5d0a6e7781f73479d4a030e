ipv4: Change fib_nexthop_info and fib_add_nexthop to take fib_nh_common

With the exception of the nexthop weight, the nexthop attributes used by
fib_nexthop_info and fib_add_nexthop come from the fib_nh_common struct.
Update both to use it and change fib_nexthop_info to check the family
as needed.

nexthop weight comes from the common struct for existing use cases, but
for nexthop groups the weight is outside of the fib_nh_common to allow
the same nexthop definition to be used in multiple groups with different
weights.
