Input: goodix - add regulators suppot

Goodix CTP controllers require AVDD28, VDDIO regulators for power-on
sequence.

The delay between these regualtor operations as per Power-on Timing
from datasheet[1] is 0 (T1 >= 0 usec).

So, enable and disable these regulators in proper order using normal
regulator functions without any delay in between.
