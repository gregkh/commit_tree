btrfs: Switch btrfs_trim_free_extents to find_first_clear_extent_bit

Instead of always calling the allocator to search for a free extent,
that satisfies the input criteria, switch btrfs_trim_free_extents to
using find_first_clear_extent_bit. With this change it's no longer
necessary to read the device tree in order to figure out holes in
the devices.

Now the code always searches in-memory data structure to figure out the
space range which contains the requested which should result in speed
improvements.
