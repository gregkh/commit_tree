gfs2: Fix sign extension bug in gfs2_update_stats

Commit 4d207133e9c3 changed the types of the statistic values in struct
gfs2_lkstats from s64 to u64.  Because of that, what should be a signed
value in gfs2_update_stats turned into an unsigned value.  When shifted
right, we end up with a large positive value instead of a small negative
value, which results in an incorrect variance estimate.
