thunderbolt: Extend tunnel creation to more than 2 adjacent switches

Now that we can allocate hop IDs per port on a path, we can take
advantage of this and create tunnels covering longer paths than just
between two adjacent switches. PCIe actually does not need this as it
is typically a daisy chain between two adjacent switches but this way we
do not need to hard-code creation of the tunnel.

While there add name to struct tb_path to make debugging easier, and
update kernel-doc comments.
