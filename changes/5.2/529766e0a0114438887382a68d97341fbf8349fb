i2c: Add drivers for the AMD PCIe MP2 I2C controller

MP2 controllers have two separate busses, so may accommodate up to two I2C
adapters. Those adapters are listed in the ACPI namespace with the
"AMDI0011" HID, and probed by a platform driver.

Communication with the MP2 takes place through MMIO registers, or through
DMA for more than 32 bytes transfers.

This is major rework of the patch submitted by Nehal-bakulchandra Shah from
AMD (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10597369/).

Most of the event handling of v3 was rewritten to make it work with more
than one bus (e.g on Ryzen-based Lenovo Yoga 530), and this version
contains many other improvements.
