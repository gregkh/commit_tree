vfio-ccw: make it safe to access channel programs

When we get a solicited interrupt, the start function may have
been cleared by a csch, but we still have a channel program
structure allocated. Make it safe to call the cp accessors in
any case, so we can call them unconditionally.

While at it, also make sure that functions called from other parts
of the code return gracefully if the channel program structure
has not been initialized (even though that is a bug in the caller).
