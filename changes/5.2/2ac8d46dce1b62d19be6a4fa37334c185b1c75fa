platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Allow to dump debug registers on S0ix failure

Add a module parameter which when enabled, will check on resume, if the
last S0ix attempt was successful. If not, the driver would warn and provide
helpful debug information (which gets latched during the failed suspend
attempt) to debug the S0ix failure.

This information is very useful to debug S0ix failures. Specially since
the latched debug information will be lost (over-written) if the system
attempts to go into runtime (or imminent) S0ix again after that failed
suspend attempt.
