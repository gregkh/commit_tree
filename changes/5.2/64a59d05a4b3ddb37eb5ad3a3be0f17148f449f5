ice: Fix for adaptive interrupt moderation

commit 63f545ed1285 ("ice: Add support for adaptive interrupt moderation")
was meant to add support for adaptive interrupt moderation but there was
an error on my part while formatting the patch, and thus only part of the
patch ended up being submitted.

This patch rectifies the error by adding the rest of the code.
