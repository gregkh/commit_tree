ipc/mqueue: optimize msg_get()

Our msg priorities became an rbtree as of d6629859b36d ("ipc/mqueue:
improve performance of send/recv").  However, consuming a msg in
msg_get() remains logarithmic (still being better than the case before
of course).  By applying well known techniques to cache pointers we can
have the node with the highest priority in O(1), which is specially nice
for the rt cases.  Furthermore, some callers can call msg_get() in a
loop.

A new msg_tree_erase() helper is also added to encapsulate the tree
removal and node_cache game.  Passes ltp mq testcases.
