drm/i915: fully convert the IRQ initialization macros to intel_uncore

Make them take the uncore argument from the caller instead of passing
the implicit &dev_priv->uncore directly. This will allow us to finally
pass something that's not dev_priv->uncore in the future, and gets rid
of the implicit variables in register macros.

v2: Rebase on top of the newer patches.
