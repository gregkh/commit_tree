powerpc/mm: make hugetlbpage.c depend on CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE

The only function in hugetlbpage.c which doesn't depend on
CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is gup_hugepte(), and this function is
only called from gup_huge_pd() which depends on
CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE so all the content of hugetlbpage.c
depends on CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE.

This patch modifies Makefile to only compile hugetlbpage.c
when CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is set.
