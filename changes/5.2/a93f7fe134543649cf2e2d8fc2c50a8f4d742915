net: phy: marvell: add new default led configure for m88e151x

The default m88e151x LED configuration is 0x1177, used LED[0]
for 1000M link, LED[1] for 100M link, and LED[2] for active.
But for some boards, which use LED[0] for link, and LED[1] for
active, prefer to be 0x1040. To be compatible with this case,
this patch defines a new dev_flag, and set it before connect
phy in HNS3 driver. When phy initializing, using the new
LED configuration if this dev_flag is set.
