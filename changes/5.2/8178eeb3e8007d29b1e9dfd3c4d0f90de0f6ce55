serial: imx: remove log spamming error message

Each time the DMA engine signals a transaction error the driver prints
a message at error level. Getting transaction errors is pretty much
expected on baudrate mismatches and the correspoding error counters
are increased in this case properly. Remove the error message which
is possibly repeated at a very high rate which can lock up the whole
system.
