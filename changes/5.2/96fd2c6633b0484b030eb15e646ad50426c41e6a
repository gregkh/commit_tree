drm/i915: Drop new chunks of context creation ABI (for now)

The intent was to expose these as part of the means to perform full
context recovery (though not the SINGLE_TIMELINE, that is for later and
just sucked as collateral damage). As that requires a couple more
patches to complete the series, roll back the earlier chunks of ABI for
an intervening PR. We keep all the internals intact and under selftests.
