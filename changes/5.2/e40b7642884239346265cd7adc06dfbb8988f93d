drm/leases: Drop object_id validation for negative ids

Not exactly sure what's the aim here, but the canonical nil object has
id == 0, we don't use negative object ids for anything. Plus all
object_id are valided by the object_idr, there's nothing we need to do
on top of that ENOENT check a bit further down.

Spotted while typing exhaustive igt coverage for all these
corner-cases.
