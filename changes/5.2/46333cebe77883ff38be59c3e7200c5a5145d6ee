scsi: qla2xxx: Simplify conditional check again

Clang warns when it sees a logical not on the left side of a conditional
statement because it thinks the logical not should be applied to the whole
statement, not just the left side:

drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_nx.c:3703:7: warning: logical not is only
applied to the left hand side of this comparison
[-Wlogical-not-parentheses]

This particular instance was already fixed by commit 0bfe7d3cae58 ("scsi:
qla2xxx: Simplify conditional check") upstream but it was reintroduced by
commit 3695310e37b4 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Update flash read/write routine") in
the 5.2/scsi-queue.
