net: hns3: modify VLAN initialization to be compatible with port based VLAN

Our hardware supports inserting a specified VLAN header for each
function when sending packets. User can enable it with command
"ip link set <devname> vf  <vfid> vlan <vlan id>".
For this VLAN header is inserted by hardware, not from stack,
hardware also needs to strip it from received packets before
sending to stack.  In this case, driver needs to tell
hardware which VLAN to insert or strip.

The current VLAN initialization doesn't allow inserting
VLAN header by hardware, this patch modifies it, in order be
compatible with VLAN inserted base on port.
