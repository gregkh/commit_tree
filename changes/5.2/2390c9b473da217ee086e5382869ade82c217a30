ASoC: Intel: kbl_da7219_max98927: remove headset

kbl_da7219_max98927 supports two configurations - One with da7219 &
max98927/373 and other one with max98927/373 alone. This patch
removes the headset dais from max98927/373 configuration. Since the
snd_soc_dapm_ignore_suspend for DMIC is called from da7219_codec_init,
the code is re-arranged to invoke snd_soc_dapm_ignore_suspend from
kabylake_dmic_init.
