KVM: arm64: Refactor kvm_arm_num_regs() for easier maintenance

kvm_arm_num_regs() adds together various partial register counts in
a freeform sum expression, which makes it harder than necessary to
read diffs that add, modify or remove a single term in the sum
(which is expected to the common case under maintenance).

This patch refactors the code to add the term one per line, for
maximum readability.
