x86/microcode, cpuhotplug: Add a microcode loader CPU hotplug callback

Adric Blake reported the following warning during suspend-resume:

  Enabling non-boot CPUs ...
  x86: Booting SMP configuration:

  CPU1 is up

The MSR in question is MSR_TFA_RTM_FORCE_ABORT and that MSR is emulated
by microcode. The log above shows that the microcode loader callback
happens after the PMU restoration, leading to the conjecture that
because the microcode hasn't been updated yet, that MSR is not present
yet, leading to the #GP.

Add a microcode loader-specific hotplug vector which comes before
the PERF vectors and thus executes earlier and makes sure the MSR is
present.
