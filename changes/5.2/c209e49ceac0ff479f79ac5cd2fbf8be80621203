xprtrdma: More Send completion batching

Instead of using a fixed number, allow the amount of Send completion
batching to vary based on the client's maximum credit limit.

- A larger default gives a small boost to IOPS throughput

- Reducing it based on max_requests gives a safe result when the
  max credit limit is cranked down (eg. when the device has a small
  max_qp_wr).
