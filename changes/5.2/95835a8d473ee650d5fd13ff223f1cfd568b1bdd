of: address: Retrieve a parent through a callback in __of_translate_address

The __of_translate_address function is used to translate the device tree
addresses to physical addresses using the various ranges property to create
the offset.

However, it's shared between the CPU addresses (based on the ranges
property) and the DMA addresses (based on dma-ranges). Since we're going to
add support for a DMA parent node that is not the DT parent node, we need
to change the logic a bit to have a callback function that will retrieve
the parent node we should use.
