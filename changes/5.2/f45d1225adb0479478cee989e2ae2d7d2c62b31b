tracing: Kernel access to Ftrace instances

Ftrace provides the feature “instances” that provides the capability to
create multiple Ftrace ring buffers. However, currently these buffers
are created/accessed via userspace only. The kernel APIs providing these
features are not exported, hence cannot be used by other kernel
components.

This patch aims to extend this infrastructure to provide the
flexibility to create/log/remove/ enable-disable existing trace events
to these buffers from within the kernel.
