ipv6: Create init helper for fib6_nh

Similar to IPv4, consolidate the fib6_nh initialization into a helper.
As a new standalone function, add a cleanup path to put lwtstate on
error.

To avoid modifying fib6_config flags, move the reject check to a helper
that is invoked once by fib6_nh_init to reset the device and then
again in ip6_route_info_create to set the fib6_flags.
