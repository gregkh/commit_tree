tools/testing/selftests/sysctl/sysctl.sh: add proc_do_large_bitmap() test case

The kernel has only two users of proc_do_large_bitmap(), the kernel CPU
watchdog, and the ip_local_reserved_ports.  Refer to watchdog_cpumask
and ip_local_reserved_ports in Documentation for further details on
these.  When you input a large buffer into these, when it is larger than
PAGE_SIZE- 1, the input data gets misparsed, and the user get
incorrectly informed that the desired input value was set.  This commit
implements a test which mimics and exploits that use case, it uses a
bitmap size, as in the watchdog case.  The bitmap is used to test the
bitmap proc handler, proc_do_large_bitmap().

The next commit fixes this issue.
