workqueue: Use normal rcu

There is no need for sched_rcu. The undocumented reason why sched_rcu
is used is to avoid a few explicit rcu_read_lock()/unlock() pairs by
the fact that sched_rcu reader side critical sections are also protected
by preempt or irq disabled regions.

Replace rcu_read_lock_sched with rcu_read_lock and acquire the RCU lock
where it is not yet explicit acquired. Replace local_irq_disable() with
rcu_read_lock(). Update asserts.
