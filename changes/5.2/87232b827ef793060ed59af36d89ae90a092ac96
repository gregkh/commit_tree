staging: kpc2000_spi: eliminated duplicate initialization of master local variable.

master was being initialized to a particular value and then having the
same value assigned to it immediately afterwards.  Removed the
initializer.

Since the value assigned to master was dynamically allocated, this fixes
a memory-leak.
