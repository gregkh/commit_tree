tracing: uprobes: Re-enable $comm support for uprobe events

Since commit 533059281ee5 ("tracing: probeevent: Introduce new
argument fetching code") dropped the $comm support from uprobe
events, this re-enables it.

For $comm support, uses strlcpy() instead of strncpy_from_user()
to copy current task's comm. Because it is in the kernel space,
strncpy_from_user() always fails to copy the comm.
This also uses strlen() instead of strnlen_user() to measure the
length of the comm.

Note that this uses -ECOMM as a token value to fetch the comm
string. If the user-space pointer points -ECOMM, it will be
translated to task->comm.
