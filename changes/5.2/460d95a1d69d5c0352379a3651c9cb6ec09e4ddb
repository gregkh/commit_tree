smack: removal of global rule list

In this patch, global rule list has been removed. Now all
smack rules will be read using "smack_known_list". This list contains
all the smack labels and internally each smack label structure
maintains the list of smack rules corresponding to that smack label.
So there is no need to maintain extra list.

1) Small Memory Optimization
For eg. if there are 20000 rules, then it will save 625KB(20000*32),
which is critical for small embedded systems.
2) Reducing the time taken in writing rules on load/load2 interface
3) Since global rule list is just used to read the rules, so there
will be no performance impact on system
