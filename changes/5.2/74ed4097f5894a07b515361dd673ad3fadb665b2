ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: set I2S slave before enabling DSP

By default, the I2S ports are configured in master mode during
DSP powerup sequences, the FS and BCLK lines will be driven on
startup, even when the topology file explicitly requires the
SSP to be slave.

This may be problematic for external components configured in
master mode who don't expect the Intel SOC/PCH to drive. Fix by
configuring the SSP as slave before the SSP outputs are enabled
to avoid this transient behavior.

When the topology file configures the SSP as clock master, the
initial slave configuration will be overridden.
