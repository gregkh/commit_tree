net: aquantia: optimize rx path using larger preallocated skb len

Atlantic driver used 14 bytes preallocated skb size. That made L3 protocol
processing inefficient because pskb_pull had to fetch all the L3/L4 headers
from extra fragments.

Specially on UDP flows that caused extra packet drops because CPU was
overloaded with pskb_pull.

This patch uses eth_get_headlen for skb preallocation.
