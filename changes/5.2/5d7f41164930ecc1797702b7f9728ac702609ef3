perf record: Implement compression for serial trace streaming

Compression is implemented using the functions from zstd.c. As the
memory to operate on the compression uses mmap->data buffer.

If Zstd streaming compression API fails for some reason the data to be
compressed are just copied into the memory buffers using plain memcpy().

Compressed trace frame consists of an array of PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED
records. Each element of the array is not longer that
PERF_SAMPLE_MAX_SIZE and consists of perf_event_header followed by the
compressed chunk that is decompressed on the loading stage.

Comitter notes:

Undo some unnecessary line breaks, remove some unnecessary () around
zstd_data to then just get its address, and fix conflicts with
BPF_PROG_INFO/BPF_BTF patchkits.
