clk: lochnagar: Add support for the Cirrus Logic Lochnagar

Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus
Logic Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of
most Cirrus Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing
connection of various application processor systems to provide a
full evaluation platform. This driver supports the board
controller chip on the Lochnagar board.

The Lochnagar can take several input clocks from the host system,
provides several of its own clock sources, and provides extensive
routing options for those clocks to be supplied to the attached
CODEC/Amp device.
