net: hns3: fix set port based VLAN for PF

In original codes, ndo_set_vf_vlan() in hns3 driver was implemented
wrong. It adds or removes VLAN into VLAN filter for VF, but VF is
unaware of it.

Indeed, ndo_set_vf_vlan() is expected to enable or disable port based
VLAN (hardware inserts a specified VLAN tag to all TX packets for a
specified VF) . When enable port based VLAN, we use port based VLAN id
as VLAN filter entry. When disable port based VLAN, we use VLAN id of
VLAN device.

This patch fixes it for PF, enable/disable port based VLAN when calls
ndo_set_vf_vlan().
