IB/hfi1: Validate page aligned for a given virtual address

User applications can register memory regions for TID buffers that are not
aligned on page boundaries. Hfi1 is expected to pin those pages in memory
and cache the pages with mmu_rb. The rb tree will fail to insert pages
that are not aligned correctly.

Validate whether a given virtual address is page aligned before pinning.
