net/af_iucv: always register net_device notifier

Even when running as VM guest (ie pr_iucv != NULL), af_iucv can still
open HiperTransport-based connections. For robust operation these
connections require the af_iucv_netdev_notifier, so register it
unconditionally.

Also handle any error that register_netdevice_notifier() returns.
