x86/speculation/mds: Clear CPU buffers on exit to user

Add a static key which controls the invocation of the CPU buffer clear
mechanism on exit to user space and add the call into
prepare_exit_to_usermode() and do_nmi() right before actually returning.

Add documentation which kernel to user space transition this covers and
explain why some corner cases are not mitigated.
