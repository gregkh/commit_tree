node: Add memory-side caching attributes

System memory may have caches to help improve access speed to frequently
requested address ranges. While the system provided cache is transparent
to the software accessing these memory ranges, applications can optimize
their own access based on cache attributes.

Provide a new API for the kernel to register these memory-side caches
under the memory node that provides it.

The new sysfs representation is modeled from the existing cpu cacheinfo
attributes, as seen from /sys/devices/system/cpu/<cpu>/cache/.  Unlike CPU
cacheinfo though, the node cache level is reported from the view of the
memory. A higher level number is nearer to the CPU, while lower levels
are closer to the last level memory.

The exported attributes are the cache size, the line size, associativity
indexing, and write back policy, and add the attributes for the system
memory caches to sysfs stable documentation.
