net: phy: aquantia: report PHY details like firmware version

Add reporting firmware details. These details are available only once
the firmware has finished initializing the chip. This can take some
time and we need to poll for init completion.

v2:
- Propagate timeout in aqr107_wait_reset_complete(). Don't bail out
  completely on timeout because chip may be functional even w/o
  firmware image.
