net: test nouarg before dereferencing zerocopy pointers

Zerocopy skbs without completion notification were added for packet
sockets with PACKET_TX_RING user buffers. Those signal completion
through the TP_STATUS_USER bit in the ring. Zerocopy annotation was
added only to avoid premature notification after clone or orphan, by
triggering a copy on these paths for these packets.

The mechanism had to define a special "no-uarg" mode because packet
sockets already use skb_uarg(skb) == skb_shinfo(skb)->destructor_arg
for a different pointer.

Before deferencing skb_uarg(skb), verify that it is a real pointer.
