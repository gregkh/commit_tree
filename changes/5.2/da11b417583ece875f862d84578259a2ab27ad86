libbpf: teach libbpf about log_level bit 2

Allow bpf_prog_load_xattr() to specify log_level for program loading.

Teach libbpf to accept log_level with bit 2 set.

Increase default BPF_LOG_BUF_SIZE from 256k to 16M.
There is no downside to increase it to a maximum allowed by old kernels.
Existing 256k limit caused ENOSPC errors and users were not able to see
verifier error which is printed at the end of the verifier log.

If ENOSPC is hit, double the verifier log and try again to capture
the verifier error.
