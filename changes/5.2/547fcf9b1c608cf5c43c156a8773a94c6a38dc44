drm/i915/icl: Fix VEBOX mismatch BUG_ON()

GT VEBOX DISABLE is only 4 bits wide but it was using a 8 bits wide
mask, the remaning reserved bits is set to 0 causing 4 more
nonexistent VEBOX engines being detected as enabled, triggering the
BUG_ON() because of mismatch between vebox_mask and newly added
VEBOX_MASK().
