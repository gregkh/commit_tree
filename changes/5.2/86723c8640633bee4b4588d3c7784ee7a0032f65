bpf, devmap: Add missing RCU read lock on flush

.ndo_xdp_xmit() assumes it is called under RCU. For example virtio_net
uses RCU to detect it has setup the resources for tx. The assumption
accidentally broke when introducing bulk queue in devmap.

Fixes: 5d053f9da431 ("bpf: devmap prepare xdp frames for bulking")
