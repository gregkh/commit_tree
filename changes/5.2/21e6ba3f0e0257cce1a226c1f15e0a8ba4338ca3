scsi: sd: Rely on the driver core for asynchronous probing

As explained during the 2018 LSF/MM session about increasing SCSI disk
probing concurrency, the problems with the current probing approach are as
follows:

- The driver core is unaware of asynchronous SCSI LUN probing.
  wait_for_device_probe() waits for all asynchronous probes except
  asynchronous SCSI disk probes.

- There is unnecessary serialization between sd_probe() and sd_remove().
  This can lead to a deadlock.

Hence this patch that modifies the sd driver such that it uses the driver
core framework for asynchronous probing. The async domains and
get_device()/put_device() pairs that became superfluous due to this change
are removed.

This patch does not affect the time needed for loading the scsi_debug
kernel module with parameters delay=0 and max_luns=256.

This patch depends on commit ef0ff68351be ("driver core: Probe devices
asynchronously instead of the driver") that went upstream in kernel version
v5.1-rc1.
