KVM: arm64: Add missing #includes to kvm_host.h

kvm_host.h uses some declarations from other headers that are
currently included by accident, without an explicit #include.

This patch adds a few #includes that are clearly missing.  Although
the header builds without them today, this should help to avoid
future surprises.
