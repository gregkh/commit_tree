spi: mt7621: Move SPI driver out of staging

This patch moves the MT7621 SPI driver, which is used on some Ralink /
MediaTek MT76xx MIPS SoC's, out of the staging directory. No changes to
the source code are done in this patch.

This driver version was tested successfully on an MT7688 based platform
with an SPI NOR on CS0 and an SPI NAND on CS1 without any issues (so
far).

This patch also documents the devicetree bindings for the MT7621 SPI
device driver.
