tcp: remove redundant check on tskb

The non-null check on tskb is always false because it is in an else
path of a check on tskb and hence tskb is null in this code block.
This is check is therefore redundant and can be removed as well
as the label coalesc.

if (tsbk) {
        ...
} else {
        ...
        if (unlikely(!skb)) {
                if (tskb)       /* can never be true, redundant code */
                        goto coalesc;
                return;
        }
}
