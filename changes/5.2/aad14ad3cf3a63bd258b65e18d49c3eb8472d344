intel_th: msu: Add current window tracking

Now that we have a way to switch between MSC buffer windows, add code to
track the current window. The hardware register NWSA that contains the
address of the next window is unfortunately not always usable, and since
the driver has full control of the window switching, there is no reason
not to keep this on the software side.
