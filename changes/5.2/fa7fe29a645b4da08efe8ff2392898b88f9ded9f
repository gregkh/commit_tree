firmware: arm_scmi: fix of_node leak in scmi_mailbox_check

of_parse_phandle_with_args() requires the caller to call of_node_put() on
the returned args->np pointer. Otherwise the reference count will remain
incremented.

However, in this case, since we don't actually use the returned pointer,
we can simply pass in NULL.
