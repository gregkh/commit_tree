afs: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that in many cases I placed a /* Fall through */ comment
at the bottom of the case, which what GCC is expecting to find.

In other cases I had to tweak a bit the format of the comments.

This patch suppresses ALL missing-break-in-switch false positives
in fs/afs
