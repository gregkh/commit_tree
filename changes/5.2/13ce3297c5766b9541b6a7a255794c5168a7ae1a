KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Add controls for the EQ configuration

These controls will be used by the H_INT_SET_QUEUE_CONFIG and
H_INT_GET_QUEUE_CONFIG hcalls from QEMU to configure the underlying
Event Queue in the XIVE IC. They will also be used to restore the
configuration of the XIVE EQs and to capture the internal run-time
state of the EQs. Both 'get' and 'set' rely on an OPAL call to access
the EQ toggle bit and EQ index which are updated by the XIVE IC when
event notifications are enqueued in the EQ.

The value of the guest physical address of the event queue is saved in
the XIVE internal xive_q structure for later use. That is when
migration needs to mark the EQ pages dirty to capture a consistent
memory state of the VM.

To be noted that H_INT_SET_QUEUE_CONFIG does not require the extra
OPAL call setting the EQ toggle bit and EQ index to configure the EQ,
but restoring the EQ state will.
