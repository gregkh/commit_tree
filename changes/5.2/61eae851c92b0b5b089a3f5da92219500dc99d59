drm/i915: Fix GCMAX color register programming

GC MAX register is used to program values from 1.0 to
less than 3.0. A different register was used instead of
the intended one. Fixed the same.

Currently limiting it to 1.0 due to ABI limitations.

v2: Updated the 1.0 programming and aligned as per GLK, based
on Ville's feedback.
