ibmvnic: Add device identification to requested IRQs

The ibmvnic driver currently uses the same fixed name when using
request_irq, this makes it hard to parse when multiple VNIC devices are
available at the same time. This patch adds the unit_address as the device
identification along with an id for each queue.

The original idea was to use the interface name as an identifier, but it
is not feasible given these requests happen at adapter probe, and at this
point netdev is not yet registered so it doesn't have the proper name
assigned to it.
