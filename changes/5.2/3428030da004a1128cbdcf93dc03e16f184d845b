ovl: fix missing upper fs freeze protection on copy up for ioctl

Generalize the helper ovl_open_maybe_copy_up() and use it to copy up file
with data before FS_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl.

The FS_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl is a bit of an odd ball in vfs, which probably
caused the confusion.  File may be open O_RDONLY, but ioctl modifies the
file.  VFS does not call mnt_want_write_file() nor lock inode mutex, but
fs-specific code for FS_IOC_SETFLAGS does.  So ovl_ioctl() calls
mnt_want_write_file() for the overlay file, and fs-specific code calls
mnt_want_write_file() for upper fs file, but there was no call for
ovl_want_write() for copy up duration which prevents overlayfs from copying
up on a frozen upper fs.
