platform/x86: pmc_atom: Add Lex 3I380D industrial PC to critclk_systems DMI table

The Lex 3I380D industrial PC has 4 ethernet controllers on board
which need pmc_plt_clk0 - 3 to function, add it to the critclk_systems
DMI table, so that drivers/clk/x86/clk-pmc-atom.c will mark the clocks
as CLK_CRITICAL and they will not get turned off.

Fixes: 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as CLK_IS_CRITICAL")
