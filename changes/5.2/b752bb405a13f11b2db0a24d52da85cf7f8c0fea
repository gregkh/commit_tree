Revert "ARM: 8846/1: warn if divided syntax assembler is used"

This reverts commit e8c24bbda7d5eba6df5ca45e5462fd3f96b8f217.

GCC 4.7, which is still permitted, emits code using the original
syntax.  This means we end up with lots of assembler warnings when
building with a currently-supported version of gcc.

Revert the commit (with fixups to keep the follow-on -mauto-it
change) to avoid these warnings.
