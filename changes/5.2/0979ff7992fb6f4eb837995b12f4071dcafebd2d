selftests/bpf: ksym_search won't check symbols exists

Currently, ksym_search located at trace_helpers won't check symbols are
existing or not.

In ksym_search, when symbol is not found, it will return &syms[0](_stext).
But when the kernel symbols are not loaded, it will return NULL, which is
not a desired action.

This commit will add verification logic whether symbols are loaded prior
to the symbol search.
