ACPI / LPSS: Use acpi_lpss_* instead of acpi_subsys_* functions for hibernate

Commit 48402cee6889 ("ACPI / LPSS: Resume BYT/CHT I2C controllers from
resume_noirq") makes acpi_lpss_{suspend_late,resume_early}() bail early
on BYT/CHT as resume_from_noirq is set.

This means that on resume from hibernate dw_i2c_plat_resume() doesn't get
called by the restore_early callback, acpi_lpss_resume_early(). Instead it
should be called by the restore_noirq callback matching how things are done
when resume_from_noirq is set and we are doing a regular resume.

Change the restore_noirq callback to acpi_lpss_resume_noirq so that
dw_i2c_plat_resume() gets properly called when resume_from_noirq is set
and we are resuming from hibernate.

Likewise also change the poweroff_noirq callback so that
dw_i2c_plat_suspend gets called properly.
