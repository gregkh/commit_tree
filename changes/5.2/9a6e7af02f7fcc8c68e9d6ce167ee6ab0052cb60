riscv: Support BUG() in kernel module

The kernel module is loaded into vmalloc region which is located below
to the PAGE_OFFSET. Hence the condition, pc < PAGE_OFFSET, in the
is_valid_bugaddr() will filter out all trap exceptions triggered
by kernel module. To support BUG() in kernel module, the condition is
changed to pc < VMALLOC_START.
