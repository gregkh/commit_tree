ALSA: seq: Protect racy pool manipulation from OSS sequencer

OSS sequencer emulation still allows to queue and issue the events
that manipulate the client pool concurrently in a racy way.  This
patch serializes the access like the normal sequencer write / ioctl
via taking the client ioctl_mutex.  Since the access to the sequencer
client is done indirectly via a client id number, a new helper to
take/release the mutex is introduced.
