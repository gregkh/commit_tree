lightnvm: pblk: GC error handling

Currently when there is an IO error (or similar) on GC read path, pblk
still move the line, which was currently under GC process to free state.
Such a behaviour can lead to silent data mismatch issue.

With this patch, the line which was under GC process on which some IO
errors occurred, will be putted back to closed state (instead of free
state as it was without this patch) and the L2P mapping for such a
failed sectors will not be updated.

Then in case of any user IOs to such a failed sectors, pblk would be
able to return at least real IO error instead of stale data as it is
right now.
