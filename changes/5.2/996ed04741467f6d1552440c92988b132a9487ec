netvsc: unshare skb in VF rx handler

The netvsc VF skb handler should make sure that skb is not
shared. Similar logic already exists in bonding and team device
drivers.

This is not an issue in practice because the VF devicex
does not send up shared skb's. But the netvsc driver
should do the right thing if it did.
