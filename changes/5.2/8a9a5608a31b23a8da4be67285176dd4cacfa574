drm/i915/icl+: Always use TPS2 or TPS3 when exiting PSR1

When any other value than EDP_PSR_TP4_TIME_0US is set, TPS1 and TPS4
will be used to do the link training when exiting PSR1.
Happily the eDP panels tested so far was able to sync with source
even without HBR3/TPS4 support but let use the right training
pattern.

TPS4 support was added to PSR1 registers because HBR3/PSR
specification was not closed when ICL was freezed so if HBR3 was
supported by PSR, ICL would already be ready but it was not added to
specification so lets always disable TPS4.

v3: Missed ";" SPANK SPANK SPANK!!!
