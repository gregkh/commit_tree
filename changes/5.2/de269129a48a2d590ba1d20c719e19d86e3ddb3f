powerpc/hmi: Fix kernel hang when TB is in error state.

On TOD/TB errors timebase register stops/freezes until HMI error recovery
gets TOD/TB back into running state. On successful recovery, TB starts
running again and udelay() that relies on TB value continues to function
properly. But in case when HMI fails to recover from TOD/TB errors, the
TB register stay freezed. With TB not running the __delay() function
keeps looping and never return. If __delay() is called while in panic
path then system hangs and never reboots after panic.
