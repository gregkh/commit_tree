mm/hmm: mirror hugetlbfs (snapshoting, faulting and DMA mapping)

HMM mirror is a device driver helpers to mirror range of virtual address.
It means that the process jobs running on the device can access the same
virtual address as the CPU threads of that process.  This patch adds
support for hugetlbfs mapping (ie range of virtual address that are mmap
of a hugetlbfs).
