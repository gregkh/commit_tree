lib/genalloc: introduce chunk owners

The p2pdma facility enables a provider to publish a pool of dma
addresses for a consumer to allocate.  A genpool is used internally by
p2pdma to collect dma resources, 'chunks', to be handed out to
consumers.  Whenever a consumer allocates a resource it needs to pin the
'struct dev_pagemap' instance that backs the chunk selected by
pci_alloc_p2pmem().

Currently that reference is taken globally on the entire provider
device.  That sets up a lifetime mismatch whereby the p2pdma core needs
to maintain hacks to make sure the percpu_ref is not released twice.

This lifetime mismatch also stands in the way of a fix to
devm_memremap_pages() whereby devm_memremap_pages_release() must wait for
the percpu_ref ->release() callback to complete before it can proceed to
teardown pages.

So, towards fixing this situation, introduce the ability to store a 'chunk
owner' at gen_pool_add() time, and a facility to retrieve the owner at
gen_pool_{alloc,free}() time.  For p2pdma this will be used to store and
recall individual dev_pagemap reference counter instances per-chunk.
