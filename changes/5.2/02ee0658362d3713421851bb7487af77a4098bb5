bpf/flow_dissector: don't adjust nhoff by ETH_HLEN in BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN

Now that we use skb-less flow dissector let's return true nhoff and
thoff. We used to adjust them by ETH_HLEN because that's how it was
done in the skb case. For VLAN tests that looks confusing: nhoff is
pointing to vlan parts :-\

Warning, this is an API change for BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN! Feel free to drop
if you think that it's too late at this point to fix it.
