power: reset: syscon-reboot: add a mask property

Make the syscon-reboot driver accept value and mask instead of
just value.

Prior to this patch, the property name for the value was 'mask'. If
only the mask property is defined on a node, maintain compatibility
by using it as the value.

This patch is based on commit
f2c199db477e ("power: reset: syscon-poweroff: add a mask property")
and does the same change for the syscon-reboot driver.
