bridge: only include nf_queue.h if needed

After merging the netfilter-next tree, today's linux-next build (powerpc
ppc44x_defconfig) failed like this:

In file included from net/bridge/br_input.c:19:
include/net/netfilter/nf_queue.h:16:23: error: field 'state' has incomplete type
  struct nf_hook_state state;
                       ^~~~~
