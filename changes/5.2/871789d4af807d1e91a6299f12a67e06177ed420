mm, memcg: rename ambiguously named memory.stat counters and functions

I spent literally an hour trying to work out why an earlier version of
my memory.events aggregation code doesn't work properly, only to find
out I was calling memcg->events instead of memcg->memory_events, which
is fairly confusing.

This naming seems in need of reworking, so make it harder to do the
wrong thing by using vmevents instead of events, which makes it more
clear that these are vm counters rather than memcg-specific counters.

There are also a few other inconsistent names in both the percpu and
aggregated structs, so these are all cleaned up to be more coherent and
easy to understand.

This commit contains code cleanup only: there are no logic changes.
