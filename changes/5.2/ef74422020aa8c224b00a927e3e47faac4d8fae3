mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Avoid warning after identical rules insertion

When identical rules are inserted, the latter one goes to C-TCAM. For
that, a second eRP with the same mask is created. These 2 eRPs by the
nature cannot be merged and also one cannot be parent of another.
Teach mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_delta_fill() about this possibility and handle it
gracefully.
