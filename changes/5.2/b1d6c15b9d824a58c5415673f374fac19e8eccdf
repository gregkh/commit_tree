bpf: simplify definition of BPF_FIB_LOOKUP related flags

Previously, the BPF_FIB_LOOKUP_{DIRECT,OUTPUT} flags in the BPF UAPI
were defined with the help of BIT macro. This had the following issues:

- In order to use any of the flags, a user was required to depend
  on <linux/bits.h>.
- No other flag in bpf.h uses the macro, so it seems that an unwritten
  convention is to use (1 << (nr)) to define BPF-related flags.
