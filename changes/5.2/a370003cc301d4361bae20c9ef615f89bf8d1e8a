binder: fix possible UAF when freeing buffer

There is a race between the binder driver cleaning
up a completed transaction via binder_free_transaction()
and a user calling binder_ioctl(BC_FREE_BUFFER) to
release a buffer. It doesn't matter which is first but
they need to be protected against running concurrently
which can result in a UAF.
