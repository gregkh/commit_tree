drm/amd/display: Update plane tiling attributes for stream updates

[Why]
Tiling and DCC attributes can change when swapping framebuffers but
these will only ever get updated on full commits where
state->allow_modeset is true. But for the page-flip IOCTL
state->allow_modeset = false so these aren't updated and DCC changes
aren't being programmed.

[How]
Split out updating the tiling and DCC attributes into its own function
that's called when creating the plane for the first time but also
called when switching framebuffers before commit stream updates.

These functions also don't modify the plane state directly since the
plane state being used as reference is often the current one
being used by the hardware.

DC needs to be able to compare plane_state to the stream update
structures to determine if the hardware programming should happen. If
it's modified in place then nothing will be programmed and we can run
into concurrency issues.
