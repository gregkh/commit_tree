bus: tegra-aconnect: use devm_clk_*() helpers

aconnect bus driver is using pm_clk_*() interface for managing clocks.
With this, clocks seem to be always ON. This happens on Tegra devices
which use BPMP co-processor to manage clock resources, where clocks
are enabled during prepare phase. This is necessary because calls to
BPMP are always blocking. When pm_clk_*() interface is used on such
Tegra devices, clock prepare count is not balanced till driver remove()
gets executed and hence clocks are seen ON always. Thus this patch
replaces pm_clk_*() with devm_clk_*() framework.
