ipv6: Simplify rt6_qualify_for_ecmp

After commit c7a1ce397ada ("ipv6: Change addrconf_f6i_alloc to use
ip6_route_info_create"), the gateway is no longer filled in for fib6_nh
structs in a prefix route. Accordingly, the RTF_ADDRCONF flag check can
be dropped from the 'rt6_qualify_for_ecmp'.

Further, RTF_DYNAMIC is only set in rt6_info instances, so it can be
removed from the check as well.

This reduces rt6_qualify_for_ecmp and the mlxsw version to just checking
if the nexthop has a gateway which is the real indication of whether
entries can be coalesced into a multipath route.
