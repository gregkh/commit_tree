mm, memory_hotplug: cleanup memory offline path

check_pages_isolated_cb currently accounts the whole pfn range as being
offlined if test_pages_isolated suceeds on the range.  This is based on
the assumption that all pages in the range are freed which is currently
the case in most cases but it won't be with later changes, as pages marked
as vmemmap won't be isolated.

Move the offlined pages counting to offline_isolated_pages_cb and rely on
__offline_isolated_pages to return the correct value.
check_pages_isolated_cb will still do it's primary job and check the pfn
range.

While we are at it remove check_pages_isolated and offline_isolated_pages
and use directly walk_system_ram_range as do in online_pages.
