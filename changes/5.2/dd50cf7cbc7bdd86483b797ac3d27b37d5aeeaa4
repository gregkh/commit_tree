powerpc/perf: Rearrange setting of ldbar for thread-imc

LDBAR holds the memory address allocated for each cpu. For thread-imc
the mode bit (i.e bit 1) of LDBAR is set to accumulation.
Currently, ldbar is loaded with per cpu memory address and mode set to
accumulation at boot time.

To enable trace-imc, the mode bit of ldbar should be set to 'trace'. So to
accommodate trace-mode of IMC, reposition setting of ldbar for thread-imc
to thread_imc_event_add(). Also reset ldbar at thread_imc_event_del().
