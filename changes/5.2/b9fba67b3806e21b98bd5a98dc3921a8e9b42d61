ocfs2: fix error path kobject memory leak

If a call to kobject_init_and_add() fails we should call kobject_put()
otherwise we leak memory.

Add call to kobject_put() in the error path of call to
kobject_init_and_add().  Please note, this has the side effect that the
release method is called if kobject_init_and_add() fails.
