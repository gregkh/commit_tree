kasan: initialize tag to 0xff in __kasan_kmalloc

When building with -Wuninitialized and CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS unset, Clang
warns:

mm/kasan/common.c:484:40: warning: variable 'tag' is uninitialized when
used here [-Wuninitialized]
        kasan_unpoison_shadow(set_tag(object, tag), size);
                                              ^~~

set_tag ignores tag in this configuration but clang doesn't realize it at
this point in its pipeline, as it points to arch_kasan_set_tag as being
the point where it is used, which will later be expanded to (void
*)(object) without a use of tag.  Initialize tag to 0xff, as it removes
this warning and doesn't change the meaning of the code.
