mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add quirk to ignore command inhibit for data

For some controllers, in Present State Register, Data Line
Active bit is not reliable for commands (such as CMD6, CMD7,
CMD12, CMD28, CMD29, or CMD38) with busy signal. DLA affects
Command with Data Inhibit bit. Therefore, software driver
may not know the busy status in DLA/CDIHB.

Futunately MMC core driver has already polled card status
with CMD13 after sending any command with busy signal. So
we can just ignore CDIHB never released issue for such
controllers. This patch is to add a quirk to handle this.
