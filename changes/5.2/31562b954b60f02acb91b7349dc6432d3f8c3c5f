ext4: make sanity check in mballoc more strict

The sanity check in mb_find_extent() only checked that returned extent
does not extend past blocksize * 8, however it should not extend past
EXT4_CLUSTERS_PER_GROUP(sb). This can happen when clusters_per_group <
blocksize * 8 and the tail of the bitmap is not properly filled by 1s
which happened e.g. when ancient kernels have grown the filesystem.
