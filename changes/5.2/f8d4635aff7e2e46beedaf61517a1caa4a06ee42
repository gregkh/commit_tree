KVM: arm64/sve: Miscellaneous tidyups in guest.c

 * Remove a few redundant blank lines that are stylistically
   inconsistent with code already in guest.c and are just taking up
   space.

 * Delete a couple of pointless empty default cases from switch
   statements whose behaviour is otherwise obvious anyway.

 * Fix some typos and consolidate some redundantly duplicated
   comments.

 * Respell the slice index check in sve_reg_to_region() as "> 0"
   to be more consistent with what is logically being checked here
   (i.e., "is the slice index too large"), even though we don't try
   to cope with multiple slices yet.

No functional change.
