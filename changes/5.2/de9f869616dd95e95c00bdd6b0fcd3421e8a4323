x86/insn-eval: Fix use-after-free access to LDT entry

get_desc() computes a pointer into the LDT while holding a lock that
protects the LDT from being freed, but then drops the lock and returns the
(now potentially dangling) pointer to its caller.

Fix it by giving the caller a copy of the LDT entry instead.
