drm/msm: Split submit_lookup_objects() into two loops

First loop does copy_from_user() without the table lock held and
just stores the handle. Second loop looks up buffer objects with the
table_lock held without potentially blocking or faulting. This lets us
clean up a bunch of custom, non-faulting copy_from_user() code.
