drm/i915/gvt: Assign NULL to the pointer after memory free.

The klocwork static code analyzer complains about using pointer after
being freed, because further we pass it to the gvt_vgpu_err() function.
Assign pointer to be NULL intentionaly, to meet requirements of the code
analyzer.

This patch fixed the issue #648 reported as error by klocwork.
