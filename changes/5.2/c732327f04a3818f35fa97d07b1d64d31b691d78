signal: improve comments

Improve the comments for pidfd_send_signal().
First, the comment still referred to a file descriptor for a process as a
"task file descriptor" which stems from way back at the beginning of the
discussion. Replace this with "pidfd" for consistency.
Second, the wording for the explanation of the arguments to the syscall
was a bit inconsistent, e.g. some used the past tense some used present
tense. Make the wording more consistent.
