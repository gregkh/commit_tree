powerpc/tm: Avoid machine crash on rt_sigreturn()

There is a kernel crash that happens if rt_sigreturn() is called inside
a transactional block.

This crash happens if the kernel hits an in-kernel page fault when
accessing userspace memory, usually through copy_ckvsx_to_user(). A
major page fault calls might_sleep() function, which can cause a task
reschedule. A task reschedule (switch_to()) reclaim and recheckpoint
the TM states, but, in the signal return path, the checkpointed memory
was already reclaimed, thus the exception stack has MSR that points to
MSR[TS]=0.

When the code returns from might_sleep() and a task reschedule
happened, then this task is returned with the memory recheckpointed,
and CPU MSR[TS] = suspended.

This means that there is a side effect at might_sleep() if it is
called with CPU MSR[TS] = 0 and the task has regs->msr[TS] != 0.

This side effect can cause a TM bad thing, since at the exception
entrance, the stack saves MSR[TS]=0, and this is what will be used at
RFID, but, the processor has MSR[TS] = Suspended, and this transition
will be invalid and a TM Bad thing will be raised, causing the
following crash:

The solution for this problem is running the sigreturn code with
regs->msr[TS] disabled, thus, avoiding hitting the side effect above.
This does not seem to be a problem since regs->msr will be replaced by
the ucontext value, so, it is being flushed already. In this case, it
is flushed earlier.
