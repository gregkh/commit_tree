kvm: selftests: aarch64: fix default vm mode

VM_MODE_P52V48_4K is not a valid mode for AArch64. Replace its
use in vm_create_default() with a mode that works and represents
a good AArch64 default. (We didn't ever see a problem with this
because we don't have any unit tests using vm_create_default(),
but it's good to get it fixed in advance.)
