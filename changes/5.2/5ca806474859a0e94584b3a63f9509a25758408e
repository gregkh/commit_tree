KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Add a global reset control

This control is to be used by the H_INT_RESET hcall from QEMU. Its
purpose is to clear all configuration of the sources and EQs. This is
necessary in case of a kexec (for a kdump kernel for instance) to make
sure that no remaining configuration is left from the previous boot
setup so that the new kernel can start safely from a clean state.

The queue 7 is ignored when the XIVE device is configured to run in
single escalation mode. Prio 7 is used by escalations.

The XIVE VP is kept enabled as the vCPU is still active and connected
to the XIVE device.
