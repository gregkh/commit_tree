HID: logitech-dj: add support for 27 MHz receivers

Most Logitech wireless keyboard and mice using the 27 MHz are hidpp10
devices, add support to logitech-dj for their receivers.

Doing so leads to 2 improvements:

1) All these devices share the same USB product-id for their receiver,
making it impossible to properly map some special keys / buttons
which differ from device to device. Adding support to logitech-dj to
see these as hidpp10 devices allows us to get the actual device-id
from the keyboard / mouse.

2) It enables battery-monitoring of these devices

This patch uses a new HID group for 27Mhz devices, since the logitech-hidpp
code needs to be able to differentiate them from other devices instantiated
by the logitech-dj code.
