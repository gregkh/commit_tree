percpu: make pcpu_block_md generic

In reality, a chunk is just a block covering a larger number of bits.
The hints themselves are one in the same. Rather than maintaining the
hints separately, first introduce nr_bits to genericize
pcpu_block_update() to correctly maintain block->right_free. The next
patch will convert chunk hints to be managed as a pcpu_block_md.
