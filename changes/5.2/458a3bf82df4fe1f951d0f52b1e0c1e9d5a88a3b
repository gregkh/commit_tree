lib/string: Add strscpy_pad() function

We have a function to copy strings safely and we have a function to copy
strings and zero the tail of the destination (if source string is
shorter than destination buffer) but we do not have a function to do
both at once.  This means developers must write this themselves if they
desire this functionality.  This is a chore, and also leaves us open to
off by one errors unnecessarily.

Add a function that calls strscpy() then memset()s the tail to zero if
the source string is shorter than the destination buffer.
