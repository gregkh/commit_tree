perf tools: Introduce Zstd streaming based compression API

Implemented functions are based on Zstd streaming compression API.

The functions are used in runtime to compress data that come from mmaped
kernel buffer. zstd_init(), zstd_fini() are used for initialization and
finalization to allocate and deallocate internal zstd objects.
zstd_compress_stream_to_records() is used to convert parts of mmaped
kernel buffer into an array of PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED records.
