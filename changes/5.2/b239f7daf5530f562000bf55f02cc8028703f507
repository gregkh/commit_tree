percpu: set PCPU_BITMAP_BLOCK_SIZE to PAGE_SIZE

Previously, block size was flexible based on the constraint that the
GCD(PCPU_BITMAP_BLOCK_SIZE, PAGE_SIZE) > 1. However, this carried the
overhead that keeping a floating number of populated free pages required
scanning over the free regions of a chunk.

Setting the block size to be fixed at PAGE_SIZE lets us know when an
empty page becomes used as we will break a full contig_hint of a block.
This means we no longer have to scan the whole chunk upon breaking a
contig_hint which empty page management piggybacked off. A later patch
takes advantage of this to optimize the allocation path by only scanning
forward using the scan_hint introduced later too.
