ARM: OMAP2+: Define _HWMOD_STATE_DEFAULT and use it

For dynamically allocated struct hwmod entries probing with ti-sysc
interconnect target module driver, we need to specify the initial default
state the same way as we do for the platform data cases.

Let's prepare for that by adding _HWMOD_STATE_DEFAULT that we can then
use to set the initial default state without a need to add similar
CONFIG_PM handling in multiple places.
