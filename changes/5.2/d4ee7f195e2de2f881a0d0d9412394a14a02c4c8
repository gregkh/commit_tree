net: mvpp2: cls: fix less than zero check on a u32 variable

The signed return from the call to mvpp2_cls_c2_port_flow_index is being
assigned to the u32 variable c2.index and then checked for a negative
error condition which is always going to be false. Fix this by assigning
the return to the int variable index and checking this instead.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
