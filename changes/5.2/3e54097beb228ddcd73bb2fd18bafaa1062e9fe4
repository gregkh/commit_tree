percpu: manage chunks based on contig_bits instead of free_bytes

When a chunk becomes fragmented, it can end up having a large number of
small allocation areas free. The free_bytes sorting of chunks leads to
unnecessary checking of chunks that cannot satisfy the allocation.
Switch to contig_bits sorting to prevent scanning chunks that may not be
able to service the allocation request.
