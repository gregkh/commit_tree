tcp: fix retrans timestamp on passive Fast Open

Commit c7d13c8faa74 ("tcp: properly track retry time on
passive Fast Open") sets the start of SYNACK retransmission
time on passive Fast Open in "retrans_stamp". However the
timestamp is not reset upon the handshake has completed. As a
result, future data packet retransmission may not update it in
tcp_retransmit_skb(). This may lead to socket aborting earlier
unexpectedly by retransmits_timed_out() since retrans_stamp remains
the SYNACK rtx time.

This bug only manifests on passive TFO sender that a) suffered
SYNACK timeout and then b) stalls on very first loss recovery. Any
successful loss recovery would reset the timestamp to avoid this
issue.
