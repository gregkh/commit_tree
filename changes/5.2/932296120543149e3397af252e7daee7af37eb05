nds32: add new emulations for floating point instruction

The existing floating point emulations is only available for floating
instruction that possibly issue denormalized input and underflow
exceptions. These existing FPU emulations are not sufficient when IEx
Trap is enabled because some floating point instructions only issue inexact
exception. This patch adds the emulations of such floating point
instructions.
