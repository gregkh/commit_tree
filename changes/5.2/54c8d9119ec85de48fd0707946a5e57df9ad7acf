arm64: mm: enable per pmd page table lock

Switch from per mm_struct to per pmd page table lock by enabling
ARCH_ENABLE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCK. This provides better granularity for
large system.

I'm not sure if there is contention on mm->page_table_lock. Given
the option comes at no cost (apart from initializing more spin
locks), why not enable it now.

We only do so when pmd is not folded, so we don't mistakenly call
pgtable_pmd_page_ctor() on pud or p4d in pgd_pgtable_alloc().
