Bluetooth: hci_core: Don't stop BT if the BD address missing in dts

When flag HCI_QUIRK_USE_BDADDR_PROPERTY is set, we will read the
bluetooth address from dts. If the bluetooth address node is missing
from the dts we will enable it controller UNCONFIGURED state.
This patch enables the normal flow even if the BD address is missing
from the dts tree.
