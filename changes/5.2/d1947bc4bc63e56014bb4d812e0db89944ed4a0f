arm64: arm_pmu: Add !VHE support for exclude_host/exclude_guest attributes

Add support for the :G and :H attributes in perf by handling the
exclude_host/exclude_guest event attributes.

We notify KVM of counters that we wish to be enabled or disabled on
guest entry/exit and thus defer from starting or stopping events based
on their event attributes.

With !VHE we switch the counters between host/guest at EL2. We are able
to eliminate counters counting host events on the boundaries of guest
entry/exit when using :G by filtering out EL2 for exclude_host. When
using !exclude_hv there is a small blackout window at the guest
entry/exit where host events are not captured.
