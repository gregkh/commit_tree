spi: rspi: Fix sequencer reset during initialization

While the sequencer is reset after each SPI message since commit
880c6d114fd79a69 ("spi: rspi: Add support for Quad and Dual SPI
Transfers on QSPI"), it was never reset for the first message, thus
relying on reset state or bootloader settings.

Fix this by initializing it explicitly during configuration.
