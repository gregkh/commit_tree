thunderbolt: Deactivate all paths before restarting them

State of the connected devices and tunnel configuration is not known
during resume. For example some paths may not be complete anymore if the
user has unplugged the related devices. So instead of marking all paths
as inactive we go ahead and deactivate them explicitly before we restart
them.
