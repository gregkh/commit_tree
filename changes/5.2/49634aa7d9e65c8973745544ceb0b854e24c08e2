staging: comedi: ni_mio_common: use insn->n in ni_m_series_eeprom_insn_read()

The `insn_read` handler for the EEPROM subdevice on M-series boards
(`ni_m_series_eeprom_insn_read()`) currently ignores `insn->n` (the
number of samples to read) and assumes a single sample is to be read
into `data[0]`.  Fortunately, the Comedi core ensures that `data[]` has
a length of at least 16 so there is no problem with array bounds.

The usual Comedi convention for `insn_read` handlers is to read the same
channel `insn->n` times into successive elements of `data[]` so let's do
that.  (Each channel corresponds to a single EEPROM address.)  In this
case, the data value comes from a local copy of the EEPROM contents.

Also, follow the usual Comedi convention and return `insn->n` from the
handler to indicate success (although any non-negative value will do).
