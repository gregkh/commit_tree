perf scripts python: exported-sql-viewer.py: Add context menu

Add a context menu (right-click) that provides options for copying to
clipboard, including, for trees, the ability to copy only the cell under
the mouse pointer.

Committer testing:

  $ python ~acme/libexec/perf-core/scripts/python/exported-sql-viewer.py ~/c/adrian.hunter/simple-retpoline.db

  Simply right click and pick "Copy selection", that at this point has
  just the first line, not expanded, then see what was copied by pressing
  shift+control+v on a terminal:

Call Path,Object,Count,Time (ns),Time (%),Branch Count,Branch Count (%)
▶ simple-retpolin,,,,,,

  Ditto after expanding, i.e. the selection continues to be just one
  line:

Call Path           Object   Count   Time (ns)   Time (%)   Branch Count   Branch Count (%)
▼ simple-retpolin

   Now select all the lines with the mouse and control+shift+v again:

Call Path                     Object             Count   Time (ns)   Time (%)   Branch Count   Branch Count (%)
