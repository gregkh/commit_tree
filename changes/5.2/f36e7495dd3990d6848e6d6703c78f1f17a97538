x86/tools/relocs: Fix big section header tables

In case when the number of entries in the section header table is larger
then or equal to SHN_LORESERVE the size of the table is held in the sh_size
member of the initial entry in section header table instead of e_shnum.
Same with the string table index which is located in sh_link instead of
e_shstrndx.

This case is easily reproducible with KCFLAGS="-ffunction-sections",
bzImage build fails with "String table index out of bounds" error.
