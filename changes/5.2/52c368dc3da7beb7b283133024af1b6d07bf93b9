net/mlx5: Move health and page alloc init to mdev_init

Software structure initialization should be in mdev_init stage.

This provides a better logical separation of mlx5 core device
initialization flow and will help to seamlessly support creating different
mlx5 device types such as PF, VF and SF mlx5 sub-function virtual device.

This patch does not change any functionality.
