bpf: add map helper functions push, pop, peek in more BPF programs

commit f1a2e44a3aec ("bpf: add queue and stack maps") introduced new BPF
helper functions:
- BPF_FUNC_map_push_elem
- BPF_FUNC_map_pop_elem
- BPF_FUNC_map_peek_elem

but they were made available only for network BPF programs. This patch
makes them available for tracepoint, cgroup and lirc programs.
