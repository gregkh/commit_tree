mac80211: handle deauthentication/disassociation from TDLS peer

When receiving a deauthentication/disassociation frame from a TDLS
peer, a station should not disconnect the current AP, but only
disable the current TDLS link if it's enabled.

Without this change, a TDLS issue can be reproduced by following the
steps as below:

1. STA-1 and STA-2 are connected to AP, bidirection traffic is running
   between STA-1 and STA-2.
2. Set up TDLS link between STA-1 and STA-2, stay for a while, then
   teardown TDLS link.
3. Repeat step #2 and monitor the connection between STA and AP.

During the test, one STA may send a deauthentication/disassociation
frame to another, after TDLS teardown, with reason code 6/7, which
means: Class 2/3 frame received from nonassociated STA.

On receive this frame, the receiver STA will disconnect the current
AP and then reconnect. It's not a expected behavior, purpose of this
frame should be disabling the TDLS link, not the link with AP.
