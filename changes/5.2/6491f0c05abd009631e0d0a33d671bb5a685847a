drm/amd/display: Add basic downscale and upscale valdiation

[Why]
Planes have downscaling limits and upscaling limits per format and DM
is expected to validate these using DC caps. We should fail atomic
check validation if we aren't capable of doing the scaling.

[How]
We don't currently create store which DC plane maps to which DRM plane
so we can't easily check the caps directly. For now add basic
constraints that cover the absolute min and max downscale / upscale
limits for most RGB and YUV formats across ASICs.

Leave a TODO indicating that these should really be done with DC caps.
We'll probably need to subclass DRM planes again in order to correctly
identify which DC plane maps to it.
