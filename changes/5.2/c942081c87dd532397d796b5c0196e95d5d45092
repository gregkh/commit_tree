clk: ux500: add range to usleep_range

Providing a range for usleep_range() allows the hrtimer subsystem to
coalesce timers - the delay is runtime configurable so a factor 2
is taken to provide the range. With the expected range for
enable_delay_us being milliseconds, the range should lie in the 250us
range which is sufficient for hrtimer optimization.
