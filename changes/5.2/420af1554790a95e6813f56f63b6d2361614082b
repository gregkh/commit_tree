powerpc/mmiowb: Hook up mmwiob() implementation to asm-generic code

In a bid to kill off explicit mmiowb() usage in driver code, hook up
the asm-generic mmiowb() tracking code but provide a definition of
arch_mmiowb_state() so that the tracking data can remain in the paca
as it does at present

This replaces the existing (flawed) implementation.
