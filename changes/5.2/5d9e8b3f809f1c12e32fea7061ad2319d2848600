hwmon: (lm25066) Support SAMPLES_FOR_AVG register

Manufacturer specific SAMPLES_FOR_AVG register allows setting the number
of samples used in computing the average values (PMBUS_VIRT_READ_*_AVG).
The number we write is an exponent of base 2 of the number of samples so
for example writing 3 will result in 8 samples average.
