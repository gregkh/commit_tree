phy: core: Invoke pm_runtime_get_*/pm_runtime_put_* before invoking reset callback

PHY drivers may try to access PHY registers in the ->reset() callback.
Invoke phy_pm_runtime_get_sync() before invoking the ->reset() callback
so that the PHY drivers don't have to enable clocks by themselves before
accessing PHY registers.
