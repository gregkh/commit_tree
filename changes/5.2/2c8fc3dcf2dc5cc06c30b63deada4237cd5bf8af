mm/hmm: add ARCH_HAS_HMM_MIRROR ARCH_HAS_HMM_DEVICE Kconfig

Add 2 new Kconfig variables that are not used by anyone.  I check that
various make ARCH=somearch allmodconfig do work and do not complain.  This
new Kconfig needs to be added first so that device drivers that depend on
HMM can be updated.

Once drivers are updated then I can update the HMM Kconfig to depend on
this new Kconfig in a followup patch.

This is about solving Kconfig for HMM given that device driver are
going through their own tree we want to avoid changing them from the mm
tree.  So plan is:

1 - Kernel release N add the new Kconfig to mm/Kconfig (this patch)
2 - Kernel release N+1 update driver to depend on new Kconfig ie
    stop using ARCH_HASH_HMM and start using ARCH_HAS_HMM_MIRROR
    and ARCH_HAS_HMM_DEVICE (one or the other or both depending
    on the driver)
3 - Kernel release N+2 remove ARCH_HASH_HMM and do final Kconfig
    update in mm/Kconfig
