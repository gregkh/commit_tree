coresight: Merge the static and dynamic replicator drivers

Merge the drivers for the two varieties of replicators into
a singel one. The dynamic replicator has programming base
which can be programmed to filter the trace data. The driver
detects the type based on the "base" address value of the
device, which is NULL for the static device.

Also, while at it, remove the now obsolete DYNAMIC_REPLICATOR
config entry.
