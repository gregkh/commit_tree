drm/pl111: Initialize clock spinlock early

The following warning is seen on systems with broken clock divider.

INFO: trying to register non-static key.
the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
turning off the locking correctness validator.

Since commit eedd6033b4c8 ("drm/pl111: Support variants with broken clock
divider"), the spinlock is not initialized if the clock divider is broken.
Initialize it earlier to fix the problem.
