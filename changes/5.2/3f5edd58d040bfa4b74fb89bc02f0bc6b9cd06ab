USB: serial: fix unthrottle races

Fix two long-standing bugs which could potentially lead to memory
corruption or leave the port throttled until it is reopened (on weakly
ordered systems), respectively, when read-URB completion races with
unthrottle().

First, the URB must not be marked as free before processing is complete
to prevent it from being submitted by unthrottle() on another CPU.

	CPU 1				CPU 2
	================		================
	complete()			unthrottle()
	  process_urb();
	  smp_mb__before_atomic();
	  set_bit(i, free);		  if (test_and_clear_bit(i, free))
	  					  submit_urb();

Second, the URB must be marked as free before checking the throttled
flag to prevent unthrottle() on another CPU from failing to observe that
the URB needs to be submitted if complete() sees that the throttled flag
is set.

	CPU 1				CPU 2
	================		================
	complete()			unthrottle()
	  set_bit(i, free);		  throttled = 0;
	  smp_mb__after_atomic();	  smp_mb();
	  if (throttled)		  if (test_and_clear_bit(i, free))
	  	  return;			  submit_urb();

Note that test_and_clear_bit() only implies barriers when the test is
successful. To handle the case where the URB is still in use an explicit
barrier needs to be added to unthrottle() for the second race condition.
