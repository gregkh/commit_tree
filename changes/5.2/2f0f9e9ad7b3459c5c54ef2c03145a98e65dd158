objtool: Add Direction Flag validation

Having DF escape is BAD(tm).

Linus; you suggested this one, but since DF really is only used from
ASM and the failure case is fairly obvious, do we really need this?

OTOH the patch is fairly small and simple, so let's just do this
to demonstrate objtool's superior awesomeness.
