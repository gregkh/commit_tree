dmaengine: axi-dmac: Split too large segments

The axi-dmac driver currently rejects transfers with segments that are
larger than what the hardware can handle.

Re-work the driver so that these large segments are split into multiple
segments instead where each segment is smaller or equal to the maximum
segment size.

This allows the driver to handle transfers with segments of arbitrary size.
