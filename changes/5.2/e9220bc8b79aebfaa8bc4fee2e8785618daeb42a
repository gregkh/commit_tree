LSM: fix documentation for the sem_* hooks

The sem_* hooks were changed in the commit
"sem/security: Pass kern_ipc_perm not sem_array into the
sem security hooks" (aefad9593ec5). The type of the argument
sma was changed from sem_array to kern_ipc_perm. This patch
updates the documentation for the hooks accordingly.
