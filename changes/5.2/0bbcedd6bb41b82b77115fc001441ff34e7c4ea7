ASoC: es8316: Add support for inverted jack detect

On some devices (Teclast X98+ II tablet, maybe others), the jack
detection has been wired backwards, so when the ES8316 reports
headphones being present it means they are actually not plugged.

Use a quirk around this incorrect behaviour, which can be enabled
through the 'everest,jack-detect-inverted' boolean device property.
