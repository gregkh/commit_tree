ARM: dts: imx6q-logicpd: Reduce inrush current on start

The main 3.3V regulator sources a series of additional regulators.
This patch adds a small delay, so when the 3.3V regulator comes
on it delays a bit before the subsequent regulators can come on.
This reduces the inrush current a bit on the external DC power
supply to help prevent a situation where the sourcing power supply
cannot source enough current and overloads and the kit fails to
start.
