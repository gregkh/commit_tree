cgroup: Include dying leaders with live threads in PROCS iterations

CSS_TASK_ITER_PROCS currently iterates live group leaders; however,
this means that a process with dying leader and live threads will be
skipped.  IOW, cgroup.procs might be empty while cgroup.threads isn't,
which is confusing to say the least.

Fix it by making cset track dying tasks and include dying leaders with
live threads in PROCS iteration.
