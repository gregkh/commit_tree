net: ll_temac: Fix support for 64-bit platforms

The use of buffer descriptor APP4 field (32-bit) for storing skb pointer
obviously does not work on 64-bit platforms.
As APP3 is also unused, we can use that to store the other half of 64-bit
pointer values.

Contrary to what is hinted at in commit message of commit 15bfe05c8d63
("net: ethernet: xilinx: Mark XILINX_LL_TEMAC broken on 64-bit")
there are no other pointers stored in cdmac_bd.
