net: hns3: add autoneg and change speed support for fibre port

Previously, our driver only supports phydev to autoneg or change
port speed. This patch adds support for fibre port, driver gets
media speed capability and autoneg capability from firmware. If
the media supports multiple speeds, user can change port speed
with command "ethtool -s <devname> speed xxxx autoneg off duplex
full". If autoneg on, the user configuration may be overwritten
by the autoneg result.
