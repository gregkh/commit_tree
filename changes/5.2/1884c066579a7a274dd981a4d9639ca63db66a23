tools: bpftool: Fix JSON output when lookup fails

In commit 9a5ab8bf1d6d ("tools: bpftool: turn err() and info() macros
into functions") one case of error reporting was special cased, so it
could report a lookup error for a specific key when dumping the map
element. What the code forgot to do is to wrap the key and value keys
into a JSON object, so an example output of pretty JSON dump of a
sockhash map (which does not support looking up its values) is:

[
    "key": ["0x0a","0x41","0x00","0x02","0x1f","0x78","0x00","0x00"
    ],
    "value": {
        "error": "Operation not supported"
    },
    "key": ["0x0a","0x41","0x00","0x02","0x1f","0x78","0x00","0x01"
    ],
    "value": {
        "error": "Operation not supported"
    }
]

Note the key-value pairs inside the toplevel array. They should be
wrapped inside a JSON object, otherwise it is an invalid JSON. This
commit fixes this, so the output now is:

[{
        "key": ["0x0a","0x41","0x00","0x02","0x1f","0x78","0x00","0x00"
        ],
        "value": {
            "error": "Operation not supported"
        }
    },{
        "key": ["0x0a","0x41","0x00","0x02","0x1f","0x78","0x00","0x01"
        ],
        "value": {
            "error": "Operation not supported"
        }
    }
]
