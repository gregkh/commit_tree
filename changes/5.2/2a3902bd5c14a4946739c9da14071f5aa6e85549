drm/i915/icl: Drop redundant gamma mode mask

gamma mode mask was not considering the 30th and 31st bits.
Due to this state readout was masking these bits, causing a
mismatch and false warning, even though the registers were
updated correctly. Dropped the gamma mode mask as it is
redundant and ideally entire register content should be
matching. This resolves the state mismatch warnings.
