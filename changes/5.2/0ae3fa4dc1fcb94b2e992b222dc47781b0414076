cifs: remove superfluous inode_lock in cifs_{strict_}fsync

Originally, filemap_write_and_wait took the i_mutex internally, but
commit 02c24a82187d pushed the mutex acquisition into the individual
fsync routines, leaving it up to the subsystem maintainers to remove
it if it wasn't needed.

For cifs, I see no reason to take the inode_lock here. All of the
operations inside that lock are protected in other ways.
