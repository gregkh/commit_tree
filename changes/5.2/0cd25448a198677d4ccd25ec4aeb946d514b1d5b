media: cobalt: replace VB2_BUF_STATE_REQUEUEING by _ERROR

The cobalt driver is the only driver that uses VB2_BUF_STATE_REQUEUEING.
Replace it by VB2_BUF_STATE_ERROR so we can drop support for the
REQUEUEING state.

The requeueing state was used in the cobalt driver to optimize
buffer handling while waiting for a valid signal: by requeueing
buffers internally there was no need for userspace to handle and
requeue buffers with the ERROR flag set.

However, requeueing also makes the buffer handling unordered, which
is generally a bad idea. Requeueing also does not work with requests
and any future fence support.

Since it is really a minor optimization in the cobalt driver it is
best to just return the buffer in an ERROR state. With this change
support for requeueing can now be removed in vb2.
