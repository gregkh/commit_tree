block: don't protect generic_make_request_checks with blk_queue_enter

Now a063057d7c73 ("block: Fix a race between request queue removal and
the block cgroup controller") has been reverted, and blkcg_exit_queue()
won't be called in blk_cleanup_queue() any more.

So don't need to protect generic_make_request_checks() with
blk_queue_enter(), then the total mess can be cleaned.

37f9579f4c31 ("blk-mq: Avoid that submitting a bio concurrently with device
removal triggers a crash") is reverted.
