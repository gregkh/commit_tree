btrfs: delayed-ref: Use btrfs_ref to refactor btrfs_add_delayed_tree_ref()

btrfs_add_delayed_tree_ref() has a longer and longer parameter list, and
some callers like btrfs_inc_extent_ref() are using @owner as level for
delayed tree ref.

Instead of making the parameter list longer, use btrfs_ref to refactor
it, so each parameter assignment should be self-explaining without dirty
level/owner trick, and provides the basis for later refactoring.
