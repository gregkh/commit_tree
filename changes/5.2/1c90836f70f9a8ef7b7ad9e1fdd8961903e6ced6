scsi: ufs: Check that space was properly alloced in copy_query_response

struct ufs_dev_cmd is the main container that supports device management
commands. In the case of a read descriptor request, we assume that the
proper space was allocated in dev_cmd to hold the returning descriptor.

This is no longer true, as there are flows that doesn't use dev_cmd for
device management requests, and was wrong in the first place.
