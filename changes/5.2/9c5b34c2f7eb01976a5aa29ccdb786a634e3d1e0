crypto: jitterentropy - change back to module_init()

"jitterentropy_rng" doesn't have any other implementations, nor is it
tested by the crypto self-tests.  So it was unnecessary to change it to
subsys_initcall.  Also it depends on the main clocksource being
initialized, which may happen after subsys_initcall, causing this error:

    jitterentropy: Initialization failed with host not compliant with requirements: 2

Change it back to module_init().
