drm/i915: Extend CONTEXT_CREATE to set parameters upon construction

It can be useful to have a single ioctl to create a context with all
the initial parameters instead of a series of create + setparam + setparam
ioctls. This extension to create context allows any of the parameters
to be passed in as a linked list to be applied to the newly constructed
context.

v2: Make a local copy of user setparam (Tvrtko)
v3: Use flags to detect availability of extension interface
