csky: Support dynamic start physical address

Before this patch csky-linux need CONFIG_RAM_BASE to determine start
physical address. Now we use phys_offset variable to replace the macro
of PHYS_OFFSET and we setup phys_offset with real physical address which
is determined during startup in head.S.

With this patch we needn't re-compile kernel for different start
physical address. ie: 0x0 / 0xc0000000 start physical address could use
the same vmlinux, be care different start address must be 512MB aligned.
