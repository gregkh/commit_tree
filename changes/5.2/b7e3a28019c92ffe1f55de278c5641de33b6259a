libbpf: remove dependency on barrier.h in xsk.h

The use of smp_rmb() and smp_wmb() creates a Linux header dependency
on barrier.h that is unnecessary in most parts. This patch implements
the two small defines that are needed from barrier.h. As a bonus, the
new implementations are faster than the default ones as they default
to sfence and lfence for x86, while we only need a compiler barrier in
our case. Just as it is when the same ring access code is compiled in
the kernel.
