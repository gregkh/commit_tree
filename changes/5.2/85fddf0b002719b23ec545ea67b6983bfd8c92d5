drm/i915: Introduce a context barrier callback

In the next patch, we will want to update live state within a context.
As this state may be in use by the GPU and we haven't been explicitly
tracking its activity, we instead attach it to a request we send down
the context setup with its new state and on retiring that request
cleanup the old state as we then know that it is no longer live.
