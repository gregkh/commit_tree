ARM: dts: exynos: Add high speed I2C ports for Exynos5260

Most of the work to support the high speed I2C ports on the Exynos5260
was added in commit 218e1496135e ("i2c: exynos5: add support for HSI2C
on Exynos5260 SoC") and the pinctrl nodes have always been available.
All that is missing to get them working is the addition of the DT bindings.
