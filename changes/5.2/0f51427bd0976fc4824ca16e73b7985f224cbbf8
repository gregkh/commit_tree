RDMA/mlx5: Cleanup WQE page fault handler

Refactor the page fault handler to be more readable and extensible, this
cleanup was triggered by the error reported below. The code structure made
it unclear to the automatic tools to identify that such a flow is not
possible in real life because "requestor != NULL" means that "qp != NULL"
too.

    drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/odp.c:1254 mlx5_ib_mr_wqe_pfault_handler()
    error: we previously assumed 'qp' could be null (see line 1230)
