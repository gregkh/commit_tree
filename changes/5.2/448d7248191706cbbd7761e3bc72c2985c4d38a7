ipv4: Refactor fib_check_nh

fib_check_nh is currently huge covering multiple uses cases - device only,
device + gateway, and device + gateway with ONLINK. The next patch adds
validation checks for IPv6 which only further complicates it. So, break
fib_check_nh into 2 helpers - one for gateway validation and one for device
only.
