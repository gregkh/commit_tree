bpftool: add ability to dump BTF types

Add new `btf dump` sub-command to bpftool. It allows to dump
human-readable low-level BTF types representation of BTF types. BTF can
be retrieved from few different sources:
  - from BTF object by ID;
  - from PROG, if it has associated BTF;
  - from MAP, if it has associated BTF data; it's possible to narrow
    down types to either key type, value type, both, or all BTF types;
  - from ELF file (.BTF section).

Output format mostly follows BPF verifier log format with few notable
exceptions:
  - all the type/field/param/etc names are enclosed in single quotes to
    allow easier grepping and to stand out a little bit more;
  - FUNC_PROTO output follows STRUCT/UNION/ENUM format of having one
    line per each argument; this is more uniform and allows easy
    grepping, as opposed to succinct, but inconvenient format that BPF
    verifier log is using.
