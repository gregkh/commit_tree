iwlwifi: mvm: support v2 of the WoWLAN patterns command

Add new definitions for the WoWLAN patterns API version 2 and support
for version 2 of the WoWLAN patterns command without implementing the
new features.  With this commit we only supporting the existing
bitmask pattern match.  Use the new version only if the TLV is set.
