hwmon: (pmbus/ir38064) Add driver for Infineon IR38064 Voltage Regulator

Add the pmbus driver for the Infineon ir38064 voltage regulator.

VOUT_MODE is not supported by the device.  The driver fakes linear16
mode with exponent value -8.

The device supports VOUT_PEAK, IOUT_PEAK, and TEMPERATURE_PEAK, however
this driver does not enable them.
