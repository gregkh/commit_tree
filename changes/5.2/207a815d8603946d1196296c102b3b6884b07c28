drm/i915: Extend skl+ crc sources with more planes

On skl the crc registers were extended to provide plane crcs
for up to 7 planes. Add the new crc sources.

The current code uses the ivb+ register definitions for skl+
which does happen to work as the plane1, plane2, and dmux/pf
bits happen the match what ivb+ had. So no bug in the current
code.

v2: Drop the unused set_wa parameter (DK)
