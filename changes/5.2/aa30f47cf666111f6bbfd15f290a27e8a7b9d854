kobject: Add support for default attribute groups to kobj_type

kobj_type currently uses a list of individual attributes to store
default attributes. Attribute groups are more flexible than a list of
attributes because groups provide support for attribute visibility. So,
add support for default attribute groups to kobj_type.

In future patches, the existing uses of kobj_type’s attribute list will
be converted to attribute groups. When that is complete, kobj_type’s
attribute list, “default_attrs”, will be removed.
