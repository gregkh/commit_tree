net/mlx5: Add meaningful return codes to status_to_err function

Current version of function status_to_err return -1 for any
status returned by mlx5_cmd_invoke function. In case status is
MLX5_DRIVER_STATUS_ABORTED we should return 0 to the caller as we
assume command completed successfully on FW. If error returned we are
getting confusing messages in dmesg. In addition, currently returned
value -1 is confusing with -EPERM.

New implementation actually fix original commit and return meaningful
codes for commands delivery status and print message in case of failure.
