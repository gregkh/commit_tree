bcache: remove redundant LIST_HEAD(journal) from run_cache_set()

Commit 95f18c9d1310 ("bcache: avoid potential memleak of list of
journal_replay(s) in the CACHE_SYNC branch of run_cache_set") forgets
to remove the original define of LIST_HEAD(journal), which makes
the change no take effect. This patch removes redundant variable
LIST_HEAD(journal) from run_cache_set(), to make Shenghui's fix
working.
