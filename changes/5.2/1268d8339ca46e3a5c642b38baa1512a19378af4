ARM: dts: mx6qdl-zii-rdu2: Use new CODEC reset pin name

The correct DT property for specifying a GPIO used for reset
is "reset-gpios", the driver now accepts this name, use it here.

Note the GPIO polarity in the driver was ignored before and always
assumed to be active low, when all the DTs are fixed we will start
respecting the specified polarity. Switch polarity in DT to the
currently assumed one, this way when the driver changes the
behavior will not change.
