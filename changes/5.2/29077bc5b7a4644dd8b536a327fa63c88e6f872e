scripts/spdxcheck.py: Add dual license subdirectory

The licenses from the other directory were partially moved to the dual
directory in commit 8ea8814fcdcb ("LICENSES: Clearly mark dual license only
licenses"). checkpatch therefore rejected files like
drivers/staging/android/ashmem.h with

  WARNING: 'SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0 */' is not supported in LICENSES/...
  #1: FILE: drivers/staging/android/ashmem.h:1:
  +/* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0 */
