arm64: Advertise mitigation of Spectre-v2, or lack thereof

We currently have a list of CPUs affected by Spectre-v2, for which
we check that the firmware implements ARCH_WORKAROUND_1. It turns
out that not all firmwares do implement the required mitigation,
and that we fail to let the user know about it.

Instead, let's slightly revamp our checks, and rely on a whitelist
of cores that are known to be non-vulnerable, and let the user know
the status of the mitigation in the kernel log.
