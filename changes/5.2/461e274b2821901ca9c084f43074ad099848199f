auxdisplay/cfag12864bfb.c: Convert to use vm_map_pages_zero()

While using mmap, the incorrect values of length and vm_pgoff are
ignored and this driver goes ahead with mapping cfag12864b_buffer
to user vma.

Convert vm_insert_pages() to use vm_map_pages_zero(). We could later
"fix" these drivers to behave according to the normal vm_pgoff
offsetting simply by removing the _zero suffix on the function name and
if that causes regressions, it gives us an easy way to revert.
