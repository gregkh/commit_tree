nvmem: sunxi_sid: Read out data in native format

Originally the SID e-fuses were thought to be in big-endian format.
Later sources show that they are in fact native or little-endian.
The most compelling evidence is the thermal sensor calibration data,
which is a set of one to three 16-bit values. In native-endian they
are in 16-bit cells with increasing offsets, whereas with big-endian
they are in the wrong order, and a gap with no data will show if there
are one or three cells.

Switch to a native endian representation for the nvmem device. For the
H3, the register read-out method was already returning data in native
endian. This only affects the other SoCs.
