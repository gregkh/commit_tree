HID: input: make sure the wheel high resolution multiplier is set

Some old mice have a tendency to not accept the high resolution multiplier.
They reply with a -EPIPE which was previously ignored.

Force the call to resolution multiplier to be synchronous and actually
check for the answer. If this fails, consider the mouse like a normal one.

       high-resolution scrolling")
