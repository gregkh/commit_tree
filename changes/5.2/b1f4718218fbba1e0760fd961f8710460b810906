watchdog: uniphier_wdt: drop platform_set_drvdata

There is no call to dev_get_drvdata() or platform_get_drvdata() in the
driver. Drop the unnecessary call to platform_set_drvdata().

The conversion was done automatically with coccinelle using the
following semantic patches. The semantic patches and the scripts
used to generate this commit log are available at
