PCI: hv: Add hv_pci_remove_slots() when we unload the driver

When we unload the pci-hyperv host controller driver, the host does not
send us a PCI_EJECT message.

In this case we also need to make sure the sysfs PCI slot directory is
removed, otherwise a command on a slot file eg:

"cat /sys/bus/pci/slots/2/address"

will trigger a

"BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request"

and, if we unload/reload the driver several times we would end up with
stale slot entries in PCI slot directories in /sys/bus/pci/slots/

root@localhost:~# ls -rtl  /sys/bus/pci/slots/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb  7 10:49 2
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb  7 10:49 2-1
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb  7 10:51 2-2

Add the missing code to remove the PCI slot and fix the current
behaviour.
