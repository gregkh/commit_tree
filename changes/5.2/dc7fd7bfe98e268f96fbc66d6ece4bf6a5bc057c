tools lib traceevent: Introduce man pages

Initial support for libtraceevent man pages - Documentation directory,
templates, configurations, Makefiles.

The first man page is also part of the patch - summary of the library
and all its APIs.

Building of the documentation is integrated into the libtraceevent build
process, new targets are added to its Makefile:

make help
make doc
make doc-clean
make doc-install
make doc-uninstall
