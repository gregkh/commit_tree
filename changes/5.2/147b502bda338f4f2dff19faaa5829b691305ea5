wlcore: simplify/fix/optimize reg_ch_conf_pending operations

Bitmaps are defined on unsigned longs, so the usage of u32[2] in the
wlcore driver is incorrect.  As noted by Peter Zijlstra, casting arrays
to a bitmap is incorrect for big-endian architectures.

When looking at it I observed that:

- operations on reg_ch_conf_pending is always under the wl_lock mutex,
so set_bit is overkill

- the only case where reg_ch_conf_pending is accessed a u32 at a time is
unnecessary too.

This patch cleans up everything in this area, and changes tmp_ch_bitmap
to have the proper alignment.
