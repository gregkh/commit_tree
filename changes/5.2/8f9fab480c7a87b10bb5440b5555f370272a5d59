linux/kernel.h: fix overflow for DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL

DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL adds the two arguments and then invokes
DIV_ROUND_DOWN_ULL.  But on a 32bit system the addition of two 32 bit
values can overflow.  DIV_ROUND_DOWN_ULL does it correctly and stashes
the addition into a unsigned long long so cast the result to unsigned
long long here to avoid the overflow condition.
