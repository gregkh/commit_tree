phy: renesas: rcar-gen3-usb2: enable/disable independent irqs

Since the previous code enabled/disabled the irqs both OHCI and EHCI,
it is possible to cause unexpected interruptions. To avoid this,
this patch creates multiple phy instances from phandle and
enables/disables independent irqs by the instances.
