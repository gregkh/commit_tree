pinctrl: sh-pfc: Validate pinmux tables at runtime when debugging

Perform some basic sanity checks on all built-in pinmux tables when
DEBUG is defined, to help catching bugs early.

For now the following checks are included:
  - Check register and field widths in descriptors for config registers
    with variable-width fields,
  - Check relations between pin groups and functions:
      - All pin functions must refer to existing pin groups,
      - All pin groups must be referred to by a pin function,
      - Warn if a pin group is referred to by multiple pin functions
	(which is OK for backwards-compatibility aliases),
  - Provide suggestions for reducing table sizes: reserved fields of
    more than 3 bits can better be split in smaller subfields, as the
    storage need is proportional to the square of the width of the
    (sub)field,

Note that a dummy non-matching entry is added to the DT match table for
checking r8a7795es1_pinmux_info, as R-Car H3 ES1.0 is matched using
soc_device_match() in r8a7795_pinmux_init(), instead of by the DT match
table.
