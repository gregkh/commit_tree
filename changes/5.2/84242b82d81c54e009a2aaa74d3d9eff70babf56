rtlwifi: rtl8723ae: Fix missing break in switch statement

Add missing break statement in order to prevent the code from falling
through to case 0x1025, and erroneously setting rtlhal->oem_id to
RT_CID_819X_ACER when rtlefuse->eeprom_svid is equal to 0x10EC and
none of the cases in switch (rtlefuse->eeprom_smid) match.

This bug was found thanks to the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
