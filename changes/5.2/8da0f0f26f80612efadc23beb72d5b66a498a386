IB/hfi1: Remove WARN_ON when freeing expected receive groups

When PSM user receive context is freed, the expected receive groups
allocated by the receive context will also been freed. However, if there
are still TID entries in use, the receive groups rcd->tid_full_list or
rcd->tid_used_list will not be empty, and thus triggering the WARN_ONs in
the function hfi1_free_ctxt_rcv_groups().  Even if the two lists may not
be empty, the hfi1 driver will free all TID entries and receive groups
associated with the receive context to prevent any resource leakage. Since
a clean user application exit is not controlled by the hfi1 driver, this
patch will remove the WARN_ONs in hfi1_free_ctxt_rcv_groups().
