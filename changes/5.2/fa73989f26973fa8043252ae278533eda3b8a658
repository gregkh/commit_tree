mlxsw: spectrum: Use a stable ECMP/LAG seed

In order to get a consistent behavior of traffic flows across reboots /
module unload, we need to use the same ECMP/LAG seed.

Calculate the seed by hashing the base MAC of the device. This results
in a seed that is both unique (to avoid polarization) and consistent.
