ext4: wait for outstanding dio during truncate in nojournal mode

We didn't wait for outstanding direct IO during truncate in nojournal
mode (as we skip orphan handling in that case). This can lead to fs
corruption or stale data exposure if truncate ends up freeing blocks
and these get reallocated before direct IO finishes. Fix the condition
determining whether the wait is necessary.
