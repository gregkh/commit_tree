iio: trigger: stm32-timer: fix build issue when disabled

This fixes a build issue when CONFIG_IIO_STM32_TIMER_TRIGGER isn't set but
used in stm32-dfsdm-adc driver (e.g. CONFIG_STM32_DFSDM_ADC is set):
ERROR: "is_stm32_timer_trigger" [drivers/iio/adc/stm32-dfsdm-adc.ko]
undefined!

There are two possible options to fix this issue:
- select IIO_STM32_TIMER_TRIGGER along with CONFIG_STM32_DFSDM_ADC.
  This is what's being done currently for CONFIG_STM32_ADC.
- stub "is_stm32_timer_trigger" function

Choice is made to stub this function as suggested in [1]. This is also
inspired by similar "is_stm32_lptim_trigger" function (see [2]) in
include/linux/iio/timer/stm32-lptim-trigger.h
