tracing: Add trace_array parameter to create_event_filter()

Pass in the trace_array that represents the instance the filter being
changed is in to create_event_filter(). This will allow for error messages
that happen when writing to the filter can be displayed in the proper
instance "error_log" file.

Note, for calls to create_filter() (that was also modified to support
create_event_filter()), that changes filters that do not exist in a instance
(for perf for example), NULL may be passed in, which means that there will
not be any message to log for that filter.
