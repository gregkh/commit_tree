arm64: Restrict ARM64_ERRATUM_1188873 mitigation to AArch32

We currently deal with ARM64_ERRATUM_1188873 by always trapping EL0
accesses for both instruction sets. Although nothing wrong comes out
of that, people trying to squeeze the last drop of performance from
buggy HW find this over the top. Oh well.

Let's change the mitigation by flipping the counter enable bit
on return to userspace. Non-broken HW gets an extra branch on
the fast path, which is hopefully not the end of the world.
The arch timer workaround is also removed.
