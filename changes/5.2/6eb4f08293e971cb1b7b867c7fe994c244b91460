x86/apic: Unify duplicated local apic timer clockevent initialization

Local APIC timer clockevent parameters can be calculated based on platform
specific methods. However the code is mostly duplicated with the interrupt
based calibration. The commit which increased the max_delta parameter
updated only one place and made the implementations diverge.

Unify it to prevent further damage.

[ tglx: Rename function to lapic_init_clockevent() and adjust changelog a bit ]

Fixes: 4aed89d6b515 ("x86, lapic-timer: Increase the max_delta to 31 bits")
