Drivers: hv: vmbus: Refactor chan->state if statement

The chan->state "if statement" was introduced in commit 6712cc9c2211
("vmbus: don't return values for uninitalized channels"). That commit
states that the purpose of the chan->state "if statement" is to prevent
returning garbage or causing a kernel OOPS when the channel ring buffer
is not initialized. The changes in this patch provide the same
protection.

Refactor the chan->state “if statement” in vmbus_chan_attr_show():
 - Instead of checking the channel state in the "if statement", check
   whether the channel ring buffer pointer is NULL. Checking the
   ring buffer pointer makes this code consistent with
   hv_ringbuffer_get_debuginfo().

 - Move the "if statement" to the four "_show" functions that access a
   channel ring buffer. Only four of the channel-level "_show" functions
   access a ring buffer. The ring buffer pointer does not need to be
   checked before calling the other "_show" functions, and moving the
   ring buffer pointer "if statement" to the "_show" functions that
   access a ring buffer makes the purpose of the "if statement" clear.
