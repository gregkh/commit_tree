spi: gpio: Don't request CS GPIO in DT use-case

DT use-case already relies on SPI core to control CS (requested by
of_spi_register_master() and controlled spi_set_cs()), so there's no
need to try to request those GPIO in spi-gpio code. Change the code
such that spi-gpio's CS related code is only used if device is probed
via pdata.
