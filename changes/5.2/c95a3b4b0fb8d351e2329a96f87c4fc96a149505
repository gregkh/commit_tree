scsi: lpfc: Fix SLI3 commands being issued on SLI4 devices

During debug, it was seen that the driver is issuing commands specific to
SLI3 on SLI4 devices. Although the adapter correctly rejected the command,
this should not be done.

Revise the code to stop sending these commands on a SLI4 adapter.
