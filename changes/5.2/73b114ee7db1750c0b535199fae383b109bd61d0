spi: bcm2835aux: fix corruptions for longer spi transfers

On long running tests with a mcp2517fd can controller it showed that
on rare occations the data read shows corruptions for longer spi transfers.

Example of a 22 byte transfer:

expected (as captured on logic analyzer):
FF FF 78 00 00 00 08 06 00 00 91 20 77 56 84 85 86 87 88 89 8a 8b

read by the driver:
FF FF 78 00 00 00 08 06 00 00 91 20 77 56 84 88 89 8a 00 00 8b 9b

To fix this use BCM2835_AUX_SPI_STAT_RX_LVL to determine when we may
read data from the fifo reliably without any corruption.

Surprisingly the only values ever empirically read in
BCM2835_AUX_SPI_STAT_RX_LVL are 0x00, 0x10, 0x20 and 0x30.
So whenever the mask is not 0 we can read from the fifo in a safe manner.

The patch has now been tested intensively and we are no longer
able to reproduce the "RX" issue any longer.
