usb: introduce usb_ep_type_string() function

In some places, the code prints a human-readable USB endpoint
transfer type (e.g. "bulk"). This involves a switch statement
sometimes wrapped around in ({ ... }) block leading to code
repetition.
To make this scenario easier, here introduces usb_ep_type_string()
function, which returns a human-readable name of provided
endpoint type.
It also changes a few places switch was used to use this
new function.
