video: amba-clcd: Decomission Versatile and Nomadik

These board families are now handled in the DRM subsystem
where we can have reusable panel drivers and some other
stuff. The PL111 there is now the driver used in the
defconfig for Versatile and Nomadik so no need to keep
this code around.

There are a few minor machines in arch/arm/ such as
mach-netx still using the old driver, so we need to keep
the core fbdev driver around for some time.
