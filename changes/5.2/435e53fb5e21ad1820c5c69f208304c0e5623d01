arm64: KVM: Enable VHE support for :G/:H perf event modifiers

With VHE different exception levels are used between the host (EL2) and
guest (EL1) with a shared exception level for userpace (EL0). We can take
advantage of this and use the PMU's exception level filtering to avoid
enabling/disabling counters in the world-switch code. Instead we just
modify the counter type to include or exclude EL0 at vcpu_{load,put} time.

We also ensure that trapped PMU system register writes do not re-enable
EL0 when reconfiguring the backing perf events.

This approach completely avoids blackout windows seen with !VHE.
