media: vsp1: wpf: Fix partition configuration for display pipelines

When configuring partitions for memory-to-memory pipelines, the WPF
accesses data of the current partition through pipe->partition.
Writeback support will require full configuration of the WPF while not
providing a valid pipe->partition. Rework the configuration code to fall
back to the full image width in that case, as is already done for the
part of the configuration currently relevant for display pipelines.
