qtnfmac: allow each MAC to specify its own regulatory rules

Currently driver uses the same regulatory rules to register all wiphy
instances. This is not logically correct since each wiphy may have
different capabilities (different supported bands, EIRP etc).
Allow firmware to pass regulatory rules for each MAC separately.
