HID: wacom: Sync INTUOSP2_BT touch state after each frame if necessary

The Bluetooth interface of the 2nd-gen Intuos Pro batches together four
independent "frames" of finger data into a single report. Each frame
is essentially equivalent to a single USB report, with the up-to-10
fingers worth of information being spread across two frames. At the
moment the driver only calls `input_sync` after processing all four
frames have been processed, which can result in the driver sending
multiple updates for a single slot within the same SYN_REPORT. This
can confuse userspace, so modify the driver to sync more often if
necessary (i.e., after reporting the state of all fingers).
