net: sched: flower: use correct ht function to prevent duplicates

Implementation of function rhashtable_insert_fast() check if its internal
helper function __rhashtable_insert_fast() returns non-NULL pointer and
seemingly return -EEXIST in such case. However, since
__rhashtable_insert_fast() is called with NULL key pointer, it never
actually checks for duplicates, which means that -EEXIST is never returned
to the user. Use rhashtable_lookup_insert_fast() hash table API instead. In
order to verify that it works as expected and prevent the problem from
happening in future, extend tc-tests with new test that verifies that no
new filters with existing key can be inserted to flower classifier.
