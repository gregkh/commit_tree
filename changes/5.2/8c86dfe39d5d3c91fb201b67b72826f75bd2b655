KVM: arm64: Reject ioctl access to FPSIMD V-regs on SVE vcpus

In order to avoid the pointless complexity of maintaining two ioctl
register access views of the same data, this patch blocks ioctl
access to the FPSIMD V-registers on vcpus that support SVE.

This will make it more straightforward to add SVE register access
support.

Since SVE is an opt-in feature for userspace, this will not affect
existing users.
