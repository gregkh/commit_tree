PM / Domains: Add support for CPU devices to genpd

To enable a CPU device to be attached to a PM domain managed by genpd,
make a few changes to it for convenience.

To be able to quickly find out what CPUs are attached to a genpd,
which typically becomes useful from a genpd governor as subsequent
changes are about to show, add a cpumask to struct generic_pm_domain
to be updated when a CPU device gets attached to the genpd containing
that cpumask. Also, propagate the cpumask changes upwards in the
domain hierarchy to the master PM domains. This way, the cpumask for
a genpd hierarchically reflects all CPUs attached to the topology
below it.

Finally, make this an opt-in feature, to avoid having to manage CPUs
and the cpumask for a genpd that don't need it. To that end, add
a new genpd configuration bit, GENPD_FLAG_CPU_DOMAIN.
