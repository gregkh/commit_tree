rcu: Inline RCU stall-warning info helper functions

The print_cpu_stall_info_begin() and print_cpu_stall_info_end() print a
single character each onto the console, and are a holdover from a time
when RCU CPU stall warning messages could be abbreviated using a long-gone
Kconfig option.  This commit therefore adds these single characters to
already-printed strings in the calling functions, and then eliminates
both print_cpu_stall_info_begin() and print_cpu_stall_info_end().
