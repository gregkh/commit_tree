s390/mm: fix address space detection in exception handling

Commit 0aaba41b58bc ("s390: remove all code using the access register
mode") removed access register mode from the kernel, and also from the
address space detection logic. However, user space could still switch
to access register mode (trans_exc_code == 1), and exceptions in that
mode would not be correctly assigned.

Fix this by adding a check for trans_exc_code == 1 to get_fault_type(),
and remove the wrong comment line before that function.
