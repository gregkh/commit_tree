cifs: fix strcat buffer overflow and reduce raciness in smb21_set_oplock_level()

Change strcat to strncpy in the "None" case to fix a buffer overflow
when cinode->oplock is reset to 0 by another thread accessing the same
cinode. It is never valid to append "None" to any other message.

Consolidate multiple writes to cinode->oplock to reduce raciness.
