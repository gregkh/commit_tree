netfilter: ctnetlink: Resolve conntrack L3-protocol flush regression

Commit 59c08c69c278 ("netfilter: ctnetlink: Support L3 protocol-filter
on flush") introduced a user-space regression when flushing connection
track entries. Before this commit, the nfgen_family field was not used
by the kernel and all entries were removed. Since this commit,
nfgen_family is used to filter out entries that should not be removed.
One example a broken tool is conntrack. conntrack always sets
nfgen_family to AF_INET, so after 59c08c69c278 only IPv4 entries were
removed with the -F parameter.

Pablo Neira Ayuso suggested using nfgenmsg->version to resolve the
regression, and this commit implements his suggestion. nfgenmsg->version
is so far set to zero, so it is well-suited to be used as a flag for
selecting old or new flush behavior. If version is 0, nfgen_family is
ignored and all entries are used. If user-space sets the version to one
(or any other value than 0), then the new behavior is used. As version
only can have two valid values, I chose not to add a new
NFNETLINK_VERSION-constant.
