ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add BYT_RT5651_JD_NOT_INV quirk

Add BYT_RT5651_JD_NOT_INV quirk for devices with an inverted
(active-high instead of the normal active-low) jack-detect switch.

And add a quirk for the Complet Electro Serv MY8307 tablet which has
an inverted jack-detect switch (and a mono-speaker).
