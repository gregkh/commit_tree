net/mlx5e: Unify logic of MTU boundaries

Expose a new helper that wraps the logic for setting the
netdevice's MTU boundaries.
Use it for the different components (Eth, rep, IPoIB).

Set the netdevice min MTU to ETH_MIN_MTU, and the max according
to both the FW capability and the kernel definition.
