arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404: Remove default setting of controlled-remotely for BAM DMA

The property controlled-remotely should not be set by default
for qcs-404 device, it should be set based on the secure boot
options (TZ or ATF) preferred by the platform. Hence, the
controlled-remotely property is moved to platform specific
dts files.
