scsi: smartpqi: properly set both the DMA mask and the coherent DMA mask

When SME is enabled, the smartpqi driver won't work on the HP DL385 G10
machine, which causes the failure of kernel boot because it fails to
allocate pqi error buffer. Please refer to the kernel log:

Basically, the fact that the coherent DMA mask value wasn't set caused the
driver to fall back to SWIOTLB when SME is active.

For correct operation, lets call the dma_set_mask_and_coherent() to
properly set the mask for both streaming and coherent, in order to inform
the kernel about the devices DMA addressing capabilities.
