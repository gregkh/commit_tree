drm/vc4: Disable V3D interactions if the v3d component didn't probe.

One might want to use the VC4 display stack without using Mesa.
Similar to the debugfs fixes for not having all of the possible
display bits enabled, make sure you can't oops in vc4 if v3d isn't
enabled.

v2: Fix matching against other v3d variants (review by Paul), don't
    forget to set irq_enabled so that the vblank uapi works
v3: Use -ENODEV instead of -EINVAL on Paul's suggestion.
