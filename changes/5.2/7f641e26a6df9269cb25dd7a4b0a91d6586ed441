ALSA: hda/hdmi - Consider eld_valid when reporting jack event

On the machines with AMD GPU or Nvidia GPU, we often meet this issue:
after s3, there are 4 HDMI/DP audio devices in the gnome-sound-setting
even there is no any monitors plugged.

When this problem happens, we check the /proc/asound/cardX/eld#N.M, we
will find the monitor_present=1, eld_valid=0.

The root cause is BIOS or GPU driver makes the PRESENCE valid even no
monitor plugged, and of course the driver will not get the valid
eld_data subsequently.

In this situation, we should not report the jack_plugged event, to do
so, let us change the function hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs(). In this
function, it reads the pin_sense via snd_hda_pin_sense(), after
calling this function, the jack_dirty is 0, and before exiting
via_verbs(), we change the shadow pin_sense according to both
monitor_present and eld_valid, then in the snd_hda_jack_report_sync(),
since the jack_dirty is still 0, it will report jack event according
to this modified shadow pin_sense.

After this change, the driver will not report Jack_is_plugged event
through hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs() if monitor_present is 1 and
eld_valid is 0.
