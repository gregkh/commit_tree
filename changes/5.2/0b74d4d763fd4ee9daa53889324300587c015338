vsprintf: Consolidate handling of unknown pointer specifiers

There are few printk formats that make sense only with two or more
specifiers. Also some specifiers make sense only when a kernel feature
is enabled.

The handling of unknown specifiers is inconsistent and not helpful.
Using WARN() looks like an overkill for this type of error. pr_warn()
is not good either. It would by handled via printk_safe buffer and
it might be hard to match it with the problematic string.

A reasonable compromise seems to be writing the unknown format specifier
into the original string with a question mark, for example (%pC?).
It should be self-explaining enough. Note that it is in brackets
to follow the (null) style.

Note that it introduces a warning about that test_hashed() function
is unused. It is going to be used again by a later patch.
