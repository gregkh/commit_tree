ibmvnic: Report actual backing device speed and duplex values

The ibmvnic driver currently reports a fixed value for both speed and
duplex settings regardless of the actual backing device that is being
used. By adding support to the QUERY_PHYS_PARMS command defined by the
PAPR+ we can query the current physical port state and report the proper
values for these feilds.
