s390: introduce .boot.preserved.data section

Introduce .boot.preserve.data section which is similar to .boot.data and
"shared" between the decompressor code and the decompressed kernel. The
decompressor will store values in it, and copy over to the decompressed
image before starting it. This method allows to avoid using pre-defined
addresses and other hacks to pass values between those boot phases.

Unlike .boot.data section .boot.preserved.data is NOT a part of init data,
and hence will be preserved for the kernel life time.
