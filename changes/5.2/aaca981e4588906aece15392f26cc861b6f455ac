Input: i8042 - signal wakeup from atkbd/psmouse

Instead of signalling wakeup directly from i8042, let psmouse and atkbd
drivers execute basic protocol handling and only then signal wakeup
condition. This solves the issue where we increment wakeup counter
simply because we are getting responses from keyboard/mouse to the
commands we ourselves send to them as part of suspend transition.
