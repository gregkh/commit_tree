arm64/mm: don't initialize pgd_cache twice

When PGD_SIZE != PAGE_SIZE, arm64 uses kmem_cache for allocation of PGD
memory. That cache was initialized twice: first through
pgtable_cache_init() alias and then as an override for weak
pgd_cache_init().

Remove the alias from pgtable_cache_init() and keep the only pgd_cache
initialization in pgd_cache_init().
