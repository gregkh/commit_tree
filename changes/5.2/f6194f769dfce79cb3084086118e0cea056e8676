wil6210: do not set BIT_USER_SUPPORT_T_POWER_ON_0 in Talyn-MB

In Sparrow, FW might sleep long time due to T_Power_On calculation
in slow clock, so T_Power_On was set to zero to shorten the L1SS
wake-up time.
In Talyn-MB the L1SS wake-up procedure is handled by the PMU (HW),
hence T_Power_On calculation is accurate and should not be forced
to zero.
