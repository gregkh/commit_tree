genetlink: optionally validate strictly/dumps

Add options to strictly validate messages and dump messages,
sometimes perhaps validating dump messages non-strictly may
be required, so add an option for that as well.

Since none of this can really be applied to existing commands,
set the options everwhere using the following spatch:

    @@
    identifier ops;
    expression X;
    @@
    struct genl_ops ops[] = {
    ...,
     {
            .cmd = X,
    +       .validate = GENL_DONT_VALIDATE_STRICT | GENL_DONT_VALIDATE_DUMP,
            ...
     },
    ...
    };

For new commands one should just not copy the .validate 'opt-out'
flags and thus get strict validation.
