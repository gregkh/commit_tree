btrfs: trace: Introduce trace events for all btrfs tree locking events

Unlike btrfs_tree_lock() and btrfs_tree_read_lock(), the remaining
functions in locking.c will not sleep, thus doesn't make much sense to
record their execution time.

Those events are introduced mainly for user space tool to audit and
detect lock leakage or dead lock.
