btrfs: extent-tree: Fix a bug that btrfs is unable to add pinned bytes

Commit ddf30cf03fb5 ("btrfs: extent-tree: Use btrfs_ref to refactor
add_pinned_bytes()") refactored add_pinned_bytes(), but during that
refactor, there are two callers which add the pinned bytes instead
of subtracting.

That refactor misses those two caller, causing incorrect pinned bytes
calculation and resulting unexpected ENOSPC error.

Fix it by adding a new parameter @sign to restore the original behavior.
