powerpc/mm: hand a context_t over to slice_mask_for_size() instead of mm_struct

slice_mask_for_size() only uses mm->context, so hand directly a
pointer to the context. This will help moving the function in
subarch mmu.h in the next patch by avoiding having to include
the definition of struct mm_struct
