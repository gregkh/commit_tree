media: rcar-csi2: restart CSI-2 link if error is detected

Restart the CSI-2 link if the CSI-2 receiver detects an error during
reception. The driver did nothing when a link error happened and the
data flow simply stopped without the user knowing why.

Change the driver to try and recover from errors by restarting the link
and informing the user that something is not right. For obvious reasons
it's not possible to recover from all errors (video source disconnected
for example) but in such cases the user is at least informed of the
error and the same behavior of the stopped data flow is retained.
