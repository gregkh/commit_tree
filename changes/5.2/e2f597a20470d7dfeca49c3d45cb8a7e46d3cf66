drm/msm: remove resv fields from msm_gem_object struct

The msm_gem_object structure contains resv and _resv fields that are
no longer needed since the reservation object is now stored on
drm_gem_object. msm_atomic_prepare_fb() and msm_atomic_prepare_fb()
both referenced the wrong reservation object, and would lead to an
attempt to dereference a NULL pointer. Correct those two cases to
point to the correct reservation object.
