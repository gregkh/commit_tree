ACPICA: Rename nameseg length macro/define for clarity

ACPICA commit 24870bd9e73d71e2a1ff0a1e94519f8f8409e57d

ACPI_NAME_SIZE changed to ACPI_NAMESEG_SIZE
This clarifies that this is the length of an individual
nameseg, not the length of a generic namestring/namepath.
Improves understanding of the code.
