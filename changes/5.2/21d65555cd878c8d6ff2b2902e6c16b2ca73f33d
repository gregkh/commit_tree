perf/x86: Simplify x86_pmu.get_constraints() interface

There is a special case for validate_events() where we'll call
x86_pmu.get_constraints(.idx=-1). It's purpose, up until recent, seems
to be to avoid taking a previous constraint from
cpuc->event_constraint[] in intel_get_event_constraints().

(I could not find any other get_event_constraints() implementation
using @idx)

However, since that cpuc is freshly allocated, that array will in fact
be initialized with NULL pointers, achieving the very same effect.

Therefore remove this exception.
