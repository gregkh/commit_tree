packet: rework packet_pick_tx_queue() to use common code selection

Currently packet_pick_tx_queue() is the only caller of
ndo_select_queue() using a fallback argument other than
netdev_pick_tx.

Leveraging rx queue, we can obtain a similar queue selection
behavior using core helpers. After this change, ndo_select_queue()
is always invoked with netdev_pick_tx() as fallback.
We can change ndo_select_queue() signature in a followup patch,
dropping an indirect call per transmitted packet in some scenarios
(e.g. TCP syn and XDP generic xmit)

This changes slightly how af packet queue selection happens when
PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS is set. It's now more similar to plan dev_queue_xmit()
tacking in account both XPS and TC mapping.

 v1  -> v2:
  - rebased after helper name change
 RFC -> v1:
  - initialize sender_cpu to the expected value
