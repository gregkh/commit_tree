Revert "drm: allow render capable master with DRM_AUTH ioctls"

This reverts commit 8059add0478e29cb641936011a8fcc9ce9fd80be.

This commit while seemingly a good idea, breaks a radv check,
for a node being master because something succeeds where it failed
before now.

Apply the Linus rule, revert early and try again, we don't break
userspace.
