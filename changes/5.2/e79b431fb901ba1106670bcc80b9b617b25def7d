vhost: vsock: add weight support

This patch will check the weight and exit the loop if we exceeds the
weight. This is useful for preventing vsock kthread from hogging cpu
which is guest triggerable. The weight can help to avoid starving the
request from on direction while another direction is being processed.

The value of weight is picked from vhost-net.

This addresses CVE-2019-3900.
