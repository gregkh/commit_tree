bpf: allow for key-less BTF in array map

Given we'll be reusing BPF array maps for global data/bss/rodata
sections, we need a way to associate BTF DataSec type as its map
value type. In usual cases we have this ugly BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR()
macro hack e.g. via 38d5d3b3d5db ("bpf: Introduce BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR")
to get initial map to type association going. While more use cases
for it are discouraged, this also won't work for global data since
the use of array map is a BPF loader detail and therefore unknown
at compilation time. For array maps with just a single entry we make
an exception in terms of BTF in that key type is declared optional
if value type is of DataSec type. The latter LLVM is guaranteed to
emit and it also aligns with how we regard global data maps as just
a plain buffer area reusing existing map facilities for allowing
things like introspection with existing tools.
