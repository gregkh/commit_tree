arm64: defconfig: enable mv-xor driver

The mv-xor DMA driver is used for the XOR engine found in the ARM64
Marvell Armada 3720 SoC, so it makes sense to have it enabled in the
arm64 defconfig. A recent boot-time regression was found in mv-xor,
which would have been more easily noticed with this driver enabled by
default.
