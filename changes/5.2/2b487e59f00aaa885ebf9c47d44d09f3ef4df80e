mm: memcontrol: push down mem_cgroup_node_nr_lru_pages()

mem_cgroup_node_nr_lru_pages() is just a convenience wrapper around
lruvec_page_state() that takes bitmasks of lru indexes and aggregates the
counts for those.

Replace callsites where the bitmask is simple enough with direct
lruvec_page_state() calls.

This removes the last extern user of mem_cgroup_node_nr_lru_pages(), so
make that function private again, too.
