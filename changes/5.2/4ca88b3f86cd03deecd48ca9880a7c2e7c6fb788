KVM: lapic: Check for a pending timer intr prior to start_hv_timer()

Checking for a pending non-periodic interrupt in start_hv_timer() leads
to restart_apic_timer() making an unnecessary call to start_sw_timer()
due to start_hv_timer() returning false.

Alternatively, start_hv_timer() could return %true when there is a
pending non-periodic interrupt, but that approach is less intuitive,
i.e. would require a beefy comment to explain an otherwise simple check.
