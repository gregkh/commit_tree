lib/bitmap.c: remove unused EXPORT_SYMBOLs

AFAICT, there have never been any callers of these functions outside
mm/mempolicy.c (via their nodemask.h wrappers).  In particular, no
modular code has ever used them, and given their somewhat exotic
semantics, I highly doubt they will ever find such a use.  In any case,
no need to export them currently.
