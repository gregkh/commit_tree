scsi: ufs: Avoid runtime suspend possibly being blocked forever

UFS runtime suspend can be triggered after pm_runtime_enable() is invoked
in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(). However if the first runtime suspend is triggered
before binding ufs_hba structure to ufs device structure via
platform_set_drvdata(), then UFS runtime suspend will be no longer
triggered in the future because its dev->power.runtime_error was set in the
first triggering and does not have any chance to be cleared.

To be more clear, dev->power.runtime_error is set if hba is NULL in
ufshcd_runtime_suspend() which returns -EINVAL to rpm_callback() where
dev->power.runtime_error is set as -EINVAL. In this case, any future
rpm_suspend() for UFS device fails because rpm_check_suspend_allowed()
fails due to non-zero
dev->power.runtime_error.

To resolve this issue, make sure the first UFS runtime suspend get valid
"hba" in ufshcd_runtime_suspend(): Enable UFS runtime PM only after hba is
successfully bound to UFS device structure.
