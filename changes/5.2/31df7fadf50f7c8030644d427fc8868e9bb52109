usb: typec: fusb302: Make fusb302_set_cc_polarity also set pull ups / downs

The 2 callers of fusb302_set_cc_polarity both call fusb302_set_cc_pull
directly before calling fusb302_set_cc_polarity, this is not ideal for
2 reasons:

1) fusb302_set_cc_pull uses the cached polarity when applying the pull-ups,
which maybe changed immediately afterwards, to fix this set_cc_polarity
already does the pull-up setting.

2) Both touch the SWITCHES0 register in a r-w-modify cycle, this leads to
read reg, write reg, read reg, write reg. If we fold the setting of
the pull-downs into fusb302_set_cc_polarity then not only can we avoid
doing the reads / writes twice, at this point we set all bits, so we
can skip the read, turning 4 (slowish) i2c-transfers into 1.

Doing this also avoids the need to cache the pull_up state in
struct fusb302_chip.
