ASoC: simple-card-utils: share asoc_simple_hw_param()

The difference between simple-card / audio-graph are just using
OF graph style, or not. In other words, other things should be same.
This means, simple-card/audio-graph common functions should be
implemented at simple-card-utils, and its own functions should be
implemented at each files.

Current simple-card / audio-graph have almost same functions.
This patch shares asoc_simple_hw_param() between in these 2 drivers.

One note is that only simple-card supports simple_set_clk_rate()
at hw_param from commit e9be4ffd4f40fcb ("ASoC: simple-card: set cpu
dai clk in hw_params").
By this patch, audio-graph has same feature.
