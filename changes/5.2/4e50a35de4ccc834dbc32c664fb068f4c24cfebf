mips: Use memblock to reserve the __nosave memory range

Originally before legacy bootmem was removed, the memory for the range was
correctly reserved by reserve_bootmem_region(). But since memblock has been
selected for early memory allocation the function can be utilized only
after paging is fully initialized (as it is done by memblock_free_all()
function). So calling it from arch_mem_init() method is prone to errors,
and at this stage we need to reserve the memory in the memblock allocator.
