RAS/CEC: Convert the timer callback to a workqueue

cec_timer_fn() is a timer callback which reads ce_arr.array[] and
updates its decay values. However, it runs in interrupt context and the
mutex protection the CEC uses for that array, is inadequate. Convert the
used timer to a workqueue to keep the tasks the CEC performs preemptible
and thus low-prio.

 [ bp: Rewrite commit message.
   s/timer/decay/gi to make it agnostic as to what facility is used. ]
