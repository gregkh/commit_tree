spi: bcm2835aux: setup gpio-cs to output and correct level during setup

Setup gpio-cs to the correct levels during setup and also make the
gpio definitely an output GPIO.

This is transparently fixing some badly configured DTs in the process
where cs-gpio is set but the gpios are still configured with native cs.

It also makes 100% sure that the initial CS levels are as expected -
especially on systems with devices on a bus with mixed CS_HIGH/CS_LOW
settings.
