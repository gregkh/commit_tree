media: cedrus: set requires_requests

The cedrus stateless decoder requires the use of request, so
indicate this by setting requires_requests to 1.

Note that the cedrus driver never checked for this, and as far
as I can tell would just crash if an attempt was made to queue
a buffer without a request.
