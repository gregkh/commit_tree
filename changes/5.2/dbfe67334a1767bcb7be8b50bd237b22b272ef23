tracing: kdb: The skip_lines parameter should have been skip_entries

The things skipped by kdb's "ftdump" command when you pass it a
parameter has always been entries, not lines.  The difference usually
doesn't matter but when the trace buffer has multi-line entries (like
a stack dump) it can matter.

Let's fix this both in the help text for ftdump and also in the local
variable names.
