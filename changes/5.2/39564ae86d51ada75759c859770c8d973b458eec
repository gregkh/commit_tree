drm/i915/ehl: Inherit Ice Lake conditional code

Most of the conditional code for ICELAKE also applies to ELKHARTLAKE
so use IS_GEN(dev_priv, 11) even for PM and Workarounds for now.

v2: - Rename commit (Jose)
    - Include a wm workaround (Jose and Lucas)
    - Include display core init (Jose and Lucas)
v3: Add a missing case of gen greater-than 11 (Jose)
