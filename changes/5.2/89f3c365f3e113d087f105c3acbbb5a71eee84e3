mmc: sdhci: Fix SDIO IRQ thread deadlock

Since commit c07a48c26519 ("mmc: sdhci: Remove finish_tasklet"), the IRQ
thread might be used to complete requests, but the IRQ thread is also used
to process SDIO card interrupts. This can cause a deadlock when the SDIO
processing tries to access the card since that would also require the IRQ
thread. Change SDHCI to use sdio_signal_irq() to schedule a work item
instead. That also requires implementing the ->ack_sdio_irq() mmc host op.
