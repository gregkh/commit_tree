spi: spi-fsl-spi: relax message sanity checking a little

The comment says that we should not allow changes (to
bits_per_word/speed_hz) while CS is active, and indeed the code below
does fsl_spi_setup_transfer() when the ->cs_change of the previous
spi_transfer was set (and for the very first transfer).

So the sanity checking is a bit too strict - we can change it to
follow the same logic as is used by the actual transfer loop.
