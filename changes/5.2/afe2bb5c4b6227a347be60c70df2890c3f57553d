mfd: cros_ec: Add host_sleep_event_v1 command

Introduce the command and response structures for the second revision
of the host sleep event. These structures are part of a new EC change
that enables detection of failure to enter S0ix. The EC waits a
kernel-specified timeout (or a default amount of time) for the S0_SLP
pin to change, and wakes the system if that change does not occur in
time.
