spdxcheck.py: fix directory structures

The LICENSE directory has recently changed structure and this makes
spdxcheck fails as per below:

FAIL: "Blob or Tree named 'other' not found"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scripts/spdxcheck.py", line 240, in <module>
spdx = read_spdxdata(repo)
  File "scripts/spdxcheck.py", line 41, in read_spdxdata
for el in lictree[d].traverse():
[...]
KeyError: "Blob or Tree named 'other' not found"

Fix the script to restore the correctness on checkpatch License checking.
