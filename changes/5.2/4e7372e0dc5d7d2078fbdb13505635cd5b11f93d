xen/swiotlb: don't initialize swiotlb twice on arm64

On arm64 swiotlb is often (not always) already initialized by mem_init.
We don't want to initialize it twice, which would trigger a second
memory allocation. Moreover, the second memory pool is typically made of
high pages and ends up replacing the original memory pool of low pages.
As a side effect of this change, it is possible to have low pages in
swiotlb-xen on arm64.
