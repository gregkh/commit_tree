mtd: rawnand: Initialize the nand_device object

In order to use some of the nanddev_xxx() helpers, we need to
initialize the nand_device object embedded in nand_chip using
nanddev_init(). This requires implementing nand_ops.

We also drop useless mtd->xxx initialization when they're already taken
case of by nanddev_init().
