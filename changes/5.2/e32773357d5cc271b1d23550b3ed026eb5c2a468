btrfs: sysfs: don't leak memory when failing add fsid

A failed call to kobject_init_and_add() must be followed by a call to
kobject_put().  Currently in the error path when adding fs_devices we
are missing this call.  This could be fixed by calling
btrfs_sysfs_remove_fsid() if btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid() returns an error or
by adding a call to kobject_put() directly in btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid().
Here we choose the second option because it prevents the slightly
unusual error path handling requirements of kobject from leaking out
into btrfs functions.

Add a call to kobject_put() in the error path of kobject_add_and_init().
This causes the release method to be called if kobject_init_and_add()
fails.  open_tree() is the function that calls btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid()
and the error code in this function is already written with the
assumption that the release method is called during the error path of
open_tree() (as seen by the call to btrfs_sysfs_remove_fsid() under the
fail_fsdev_sysfs label).
