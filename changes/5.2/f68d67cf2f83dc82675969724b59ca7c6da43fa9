livepatch: Remove duplicated code for early initialization

kobject_init() call added one more operation that has to be
done when doing the early initialization of both static and
dynamic livepatch structures.

It would have been easier when the early initialization code
was not duplicated. Let's deduplicate it for future generations
of livepatching hackers.

The patch does not change the existing behavior.
