clk: Do a DT parent lookup even when index < 0

We want to allow the parent lookup to happen even if the index is some
value less than 0. This may be the case if a clk provider only specifies
the .name member to match a string in the "clock-names" DT property. We
shouldn't require that the index be >= 0 to make this use case work.
