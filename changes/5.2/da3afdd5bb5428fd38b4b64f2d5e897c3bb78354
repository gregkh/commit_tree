percpu: use block scan_hint to only scan forward

Blocks now remember the latest scan_hint. This can be used on the
allocation path as when a contig_hint is broken, we can promote the
scan_hint to the contig_hint and scan forward from there. This works
because pcpu_block_refresh_hint() is only called on the allocation path
while block free regions are updated manually in
pcpu_block_update_hint_free().
