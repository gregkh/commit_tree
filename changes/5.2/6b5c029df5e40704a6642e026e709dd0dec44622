drm/vc4: Add a debugfs entry to disable/enable the load tracker

In order to test whether the load tracker is working as expected, we
need the ability to compare the commit result with the underrun
indication. With the load tracker always enabled, commits that are
expected to trigger an underrun are always rejected, so userspace
cannot get the actual underrun indication from the hardware.

Add a debugfs entry to disable/enable the load tracker, so that a DRM
commit expected to trigger an underrun can go through with the load
tracker disabled. The underrun indication is then available to
userspace and can be checked against the commit result with the load
tracker enabled.
