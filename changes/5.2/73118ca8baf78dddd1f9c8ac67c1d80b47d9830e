gfs2: Replace gl_revokes with a GLF flag

The gl_revokes value determines how many outstanding revokes a glock has
on the superblock revokes list; this is used to avoid unnecessary log
flushes.  However, gl_revokes is only ever tested for being zero, and it's
only decremented in revoke_lo_after_commit, which removes all revokes
from the list, so we know that the gl_revoke values of all the glocks on
the list will reach zero.  Therefore, we can replace gl_revokes with a
bit flag. This saves an atomic counter in struct gfs2_glock.
