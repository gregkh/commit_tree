ARM: dts: imx50: Specify IMX5_CLK_IPG as "ahb" clock to SDMA

Since 25aaa75df1e6 SDMA driver uses clock rates of "ipg" and "ahb"
clock to determine if it needs to configure the IP block as operating
at 1:1 or 1:2 clock ratio (ACR bit in SDMAARM_CONFIG). Specifying both
clocks as IMX5_CLK_SDMA results in driver incorrectly thinking that
ratio is 1:1 which results in broken SDMA funtionality. Fix the code
to specify IMX5_CLK_AHB as "ahb" clock for SDMA, to avoid detecting
incorrect clock ratio.
