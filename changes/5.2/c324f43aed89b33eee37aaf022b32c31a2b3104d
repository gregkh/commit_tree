cpuidle: exynos: Unify target residency for AFTR and coupled AFTR states

Since commit 45f1ff59e27c ("cpuidle: Return nohz hint from
cpuidle_select()") Exynos CPUidle driver stopped entering C1 (AFTR) mode
on Exynos4412-based Trats2 board.

Further analysis revealed that the CPUidle framework changed the way
it handles predicted timer ticks and reported target residency for the
given idle states. As a result, the C1 (AFTR) state was not chosen
anymore on completely idle device. The main issue was to high target
residency value. The similar C1 (AFTR) state for 'coupled' CPUidle
version used 10 times lower value for the target residency, despite
the fact that it is the same state from the hardware perspective.

The 100000us value for standard C1 (AFTR) mode is there from the begining
of the support for this idle state, added by the commit 67173ca492ab
("ARM: EXYNOS: Add support AFTR mode on EXYNOS4210"). That commit doesn't
give any reason for it, instead it looks like it was blindly copied from
the WFI/IDLE state of the same driver that time. That time, that value
was probably not really used by the framework for any critical decision,
so it didn't matter that much.

Now it turned out to be an issue, so unify the target residency with the
'coupled' version, as it seems to better match the real use case values
and restores the operation of the Exynos CPUidle driver on the idle
device.
