media: Introduce helpers to fill pixel format structs

Add two new API helpers, v4l2_fill_pixfmt and v4l2_fill_pixfmt_mp,
to be used by drivers to calculate plane sizes and bytes per lines.

Note that driver-specific padding and alignment are not
taken into account, and must be done by drivers using this API.
