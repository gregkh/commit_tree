s390/sclp: do not use static sccbs

The sccbs for init/read/sdias/early have to be located below 2 GB, and
they are currently defined as a static buffer.

With a relocatable kernel that could reside at any place in memory, this
will no longer guarantee the location below 2 GB, so use a dynamic
GFP_DMA allocation instead.

The sclp_early_sccb buffer needs special handling, as it can be used
very early, and by both the decompressor and also the decompressed
kernel. Therefore, a fixed 4 KB buffer is introduced at 0x11000, the
former PARMAREA_END. The new PARMAREA_END is now 0x12000, and it is
renamed to HEAD_END, as it is rather the end of head.S and not the end
of the parmarea.
