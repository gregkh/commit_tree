powerpc/32: Don't add dummy frames when calling trace_hardirqs_on/off

No need to add dummy frames when calling trace_hardirqs_on or
trace_hardirqs_off. GCC properly handles empty stacks.

In addition, powerpc doesn't set CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, therefore
__builtin_return_address(1..) returns NULL at all time. So the
dummy frames are definitely unneeded here.

In the meantime, avoid reading memory for loading r1 with a value
we already know.
