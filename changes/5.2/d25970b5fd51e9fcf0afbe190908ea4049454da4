ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Control clock gating with CCF

Control the clock gating to the various clock components to use
the CCF.  This allows us to prepare_enalbe only 3 clocks and the
relationships assigned to them will cause upstream clockss to
enable automatically.  Additionally we can do this in a single
call to the CCF.
