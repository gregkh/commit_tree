ice: configure GLINT_ITR to always have an ITR gran of 2

Instead of hoping that our ITR granularity will be 2 usec program the
GLINT_CTL register to make sure the ITR granularity is always 2 usecs.

Now that we know what the ITR granularity will be get rid of the check
in ice_probe() to verify our previous assumption.
