rseq/selftests: mips: use break instruction for RSEQ_SIG

Use break as guard instruction for the restartable sequence abort
handler.

Previously, the chosen signature was simply data, based on the
assumption that it could always sit in a literal pool. However,
some compilation environments favor disabling literal pool. Therefore,
ensure the signature is a valid uncommon trap instruction.
