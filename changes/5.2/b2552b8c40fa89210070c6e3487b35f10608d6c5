net: sched: flower: track filter deletion with flag

In order to prevent double deletion of filter by concurrent tasks when rtnl
lock is not used for synchronization, add 'deleted' filter field. Check
value of this field when modifying filters and return error if concurrent
deletion is detected.

Refactor __fl_delete() to accept pointer to 'last' boolean as argument,
and return error code as function return value instead. This is necessary
to signal concurrent filter delete to caller.
