tuntap: synchronize through tfiles array instead of tun->numqueues

When a queue(tfile) is detached through __tun_detach(), we move the
last enabled tfile to the position where detached one sit but don't
NULL out last position. We expect to synchronize the datapath through
tun->numqueues. Unfortunately, this won't work since we're lacking
sufficient mechanism to order or synchronize the access to
tun->numqueues.

To fix this, NULL out the last position during detaching and check
RCU protected tfile against NULL instead of checking tun->numqueues in
datapath.
