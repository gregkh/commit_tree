media: imx: csi: Allow unknown nearest upstream entities

On i.MX6, the nearest upstream entity to the CSI can only be the
CSI video muxes or the Synopsys DW MIPI CSI-2 receiver.

However the i.MX53 has no CSI video muxes or a MIPI CSI-2 receiver.
So allow for the nearest upstream entity to the CSI to be something
other than those.

upstream entity")
