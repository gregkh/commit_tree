s390/qeth: remove locking for RX modeset cache

The L2 and L3 .ndo_set_rx_mode callbacks maintain an address cache
to decide which addresses have changed since the last modeset.

When the card is set offline, qeth_l?_stop_card() drains this cache.
This happens only after 1) the net_device has been detached, and
2) any pending RX modeset has completed. Consequently we can access the
cache lock-free.
