dmaengine: tegra210-adma: add support for Tegra186/Tegra194

Add Tegra186 specific macro defines and chip_data structure for chip
specific information. New compatibility is added to select relevant
chip details. There is no major change for Tegra194 and hence it can
use the same chip data.

The bits in the BURST_SIZE field of the ADMA CH_CONFIG register are
encoded differently on Tegra186 and Tegra194 compared with Tegra210.
On Tegra210 the bits are encoded as follows ...

 1 = WORD_1
 2 = WORDS_2
 3 = WORDS_4
 4 = WORDS_8
 5 = WORDS_16

Where as on Tegra186 and Tegra194 the bits are encoded as ...

 0 = WORD_1
 1 = WORDS_2
 2 = WORDS_3
 3 = WORDS_4
 4 = WORDS_5
 ...
 15 = WORDS_16

Add helper functions for generating the correct burst size.
