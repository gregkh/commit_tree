powerpc/mm: Warn if W+X pages found on boot

Implement code to walk all pages and warn if any are found to be both
writable and executable.  Depends on STRICT_KERNEL_RWX enabled, and is
behind the DEBUG_WX config option.

This only runs on boot and has no runtime performance implications.

Very heavily influenced (and in some cases copied verbatim) from the
ARM64 code written by Laura Abbott (thanks!), since our ptdump
infrastructure is similar.
