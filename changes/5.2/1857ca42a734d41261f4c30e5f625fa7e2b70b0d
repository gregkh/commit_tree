ice: Get rid of ice_pull_tail

Instead of adding a frag and later when dealing with EOP frame accessing
that frag in order to copy the headers onto linear part of skb, we can do
this in ice_add_rx_frag in case where the data_len is still 0 and frame
won't fit onto the linear part as a whole.

Function comment of ice_pull_tail was a bit misleading because of
mentioned optimizations that can be performed (drop a frag/maintaining
accurate truesize of skb) - it seems that this part of logic was dropped
and the comment was not updated to reflect this change.
