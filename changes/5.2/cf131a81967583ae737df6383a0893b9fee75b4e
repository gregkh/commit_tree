IB/hfi1: Avoid hardlockup with flushlist_lock

Heavy contention of the sde flushlist_lock can cause hard lockups at
extreme scale when the flushing logic is under stress.

Mitigate by replacing the item at a time copy to the local list with
an O(1) list_splice_init() and using the high priority work queue to
do the flushes.
