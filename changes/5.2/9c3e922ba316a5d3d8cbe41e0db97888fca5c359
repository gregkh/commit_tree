KVM: nVMX: Move guest non-reg state checks to VM-Exit path

Per Intel's SDM, volume 3, section Checking and Loading Guest State:

  Because the checking and the loading occur concurrently, a failure may
  be discovered only after some state has been loaded. For this reason,
  the logical processor responds to such failures by loading state from
  the host-state area, as it would for a VM exit.

In other words, a failed non-register state consistency check results in
a VM-Exit, not VM-Fail.  Moving the non-reg state checks also paves the
way for renaming nested_vmx_check_vmentry_postreqs() to align with the
SDM, i.e. nested_vmx_check_vmentry_guest_state().
