tty: rocket: fix incorrect forward declaration of 'rp_init()'

Make the forward declaration actually match the real function
definition, something that previous versions of gcc had just ignored.

This is another patch to fix new warnings from gcc-9 before I start the
merge window pulls.  I don't want to miss legitimate new warnings just
because my system update brought a new compiler with new warnings.
