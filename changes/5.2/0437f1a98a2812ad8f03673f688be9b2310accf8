ice: Use bitfields where possible

The driver was converted to not use bool, but it was
neglected that the bools should have been converted to bit fields
as bit fields in software structures are ok, as long as they
use the correct kinds of unsigned types. This avoids
wasting lots of storage space to store single bit values.

One of the change hunks moves a variable lport out of
a group of "combinable" bit fields because all bits of
the u8 lport are valid and the variable can be packed in the
struct in struct holes.
