ASoC: codec: hdac_hdmi: no checking monitor in hw_params

Some userspace apps, like pulseaudio, may call open, hw_params,
prepare to judge whether the pcm is ready or not. Current hdac_hdmi
will return -ENODEV if monitor is not connected, which will cause
the apps believe the pcm is not ready. Actually PCM for hdmi is ready,
even the monitor is not connected.

This patch removes the check of monitor presence in hw_params, just like
what the legacy HD-Audio driver does.
