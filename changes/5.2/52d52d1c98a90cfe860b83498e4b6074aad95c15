block: only allow contiguous page structs in a bio_vec

We currently have to call nth_page when iterating over pages inside a
bio_vec.  Jens complained a while ago that this is fairly expensive.
To mitigate this we can check that that the actual page structures
are contiguous when adding them to the bio, and just do check pointer
arithmetics later on.
