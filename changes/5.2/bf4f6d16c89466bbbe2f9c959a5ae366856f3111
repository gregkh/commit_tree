drm: switch drm_fb_memcpy_dstclip to accept __iomem dst

Not all archs have the __io_virt() macro, so cirrus can't simply convert
pointers that way.  The drm format helpers have to use memcpy_toio()
instead.

This patch makes drm_fb_memcpy_dstclip() accept a __iomem dst pointer
and use memcpy_toio() instead of memcpy().  With that separating out the
memcpy loop into the drm_fb_memcpy_lines() helper isn't useful any more,
so move the code back into the calling functins.
