rcu: Fix force_qs_rnp() header comment

Previously, threads blocked on offlining CPUS were migrated to the
root rcu_node structure, thus requiring RCU priority boosting on this
structure.  However, since commit d19fb8d1f3f6 ("rcu: Don't migrate
blocked tasks even if all corresponding CPUs offline"), RCU does not
migrate blocked tasks.  Consequently, RCU no longer does RCU priority
boosting on the root rcu_node structure as of commit 1be0085b515e ("rcu:
Don't initiate RCU priority boosting on root rcu_node").

This commit therefore brings comments for the force_qs_rnp() function's
header comment in line with this new no-root-boosting reality.
