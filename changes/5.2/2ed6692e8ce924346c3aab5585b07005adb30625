spi: spidev: Enable control of inter-word delays

Commit b7bb367afa4b added support for inserting delays in between
individual words within a single SPI transaction. This makes it
accessible from userspace.

WARNING: This delay is silently ignored unless the SPI controller
implements extra support for it. This is similar to how the in-kernel
users handle the other existing property, spi_transfer->word_delay.
