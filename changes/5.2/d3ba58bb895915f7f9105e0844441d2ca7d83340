ALSA: hda/realtek - Support low power consumption for ALC295

Enter to close more power control widgets at suspend.
Remove hp_pin check. Add the default pin 0x21 as headphone.
Supported low power consumption, it must do depop procedure when
headset jack was plugged or unplugged.
So, alc225_init() and alc225_shutup() must run delay when headset
jack was plugged or unplugged.
If depop procedure not run with delay, it will have a chance to let
power consumption raise high.
