selftests/seccomp: Handle namespace failures gracefully

When running without USERNS or PIDNS the seccomp test would hang since
it was waiting forever for the child to trigger the user notification
since it seems the glibc() abort handler makes a call to getpid(),
which would trap again. This changes the getpid filter to getppid, and
makes sure ASSERTs execute to stop from spawning the listener.
