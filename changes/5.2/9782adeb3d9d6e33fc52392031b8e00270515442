cpufreq: schedutil: Replace default_attrs field with groups

The kobj_type default_attrs field is being replaced by the
default_groups field. Replace sugov_tunables_ktype's default_attrs field
with default groups. Change "sugov_attributes" to "sugov_attrs" and use
the ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS macro to create sugov_groups.

This patch was tested by setting the scaling governor to schedutil and
verifying that the sysfs files for the attributes in the default groups
were created.
