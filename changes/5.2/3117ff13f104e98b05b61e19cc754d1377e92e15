tty: Add NULL TTY driver

If no console driver is enabled (or if a non-present driver is selected
with something like console=null in an attempt to disable the console),
opening /dev/console errors out, and init scripts and other userspace
code that relies on the existence of a console will fail.  Symlinking
/dev/null to /dev/console does not solve the problem since /dev/null
does not behave like a real TTY.

To just provide a dummy console to userspace when no console driver is
available or desired, add a ttynull driver which simply discards all
writes.  It can be chosen on the command line in the standard way, i.e.
with console=ttynull.
