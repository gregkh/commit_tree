powerpc/powernv: Return for invalid IMC domain

Currently init_imc_pmu() can fail either because we try to register an
IMC unit with an invalid domain (i.e an IMC node not supported by the
kernel) or something went wrong while registering a valid IMC unit. In
both the cases kernel provides a 'Register failed' error message.

For example when trace-imc node is not supported by the kernel, but
skiboot advertises a trace-imc node we print:

  IMC Unknown Device type
  IMC PMU (null) Register failed

To avoid confusion just print the unknown device type message, before
attempting PMU registration, so the second message isn't printed.
