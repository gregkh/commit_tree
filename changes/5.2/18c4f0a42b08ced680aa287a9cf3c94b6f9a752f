scsi: core: don't hold device refcount in IO path

scsi_device's refcount is always grabbed in IO path.

Turns out it isn't necessary, because blk_queue_cleanup() will drain any
in-flight IOs, then cancel timeout/requeue work, and SCSI's requeue_work is
canceled too in __scsi_remove_device().

Also scsi_device won't go away until blk_cleanup_queue() is done.

So don't hold the refcount in IO path, especially the refcount isn't
required in IO path since blk_queue_enter() / blk_queue_exit() is
introduced in the legacy block layer.
