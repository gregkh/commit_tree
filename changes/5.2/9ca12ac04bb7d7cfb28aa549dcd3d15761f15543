kernel/cpu: Allow non-zero CPU to be primary for suspend / kexec freeze

This patch provides an arch option, ARCH_SUSPEND_NONZERO_CPU, to
opt-in to allowing suspend to occur on one of the housekeeping CPUs
rather than hardcoded CPU0.

This will allow CPU0 to be a nohz_full CPU with a later change.

It may be possible for platforms with hardware/firmware restrictions
on suspend/wake effectively support this by handing off the final
stage to CPU0 when kernel housekeeping is no longer required. Another
option is to make housekeeping / nohz_full mask dynamic at runtime,
but the complexity could not be justified at this time.
