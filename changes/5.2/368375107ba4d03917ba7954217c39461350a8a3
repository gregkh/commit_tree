drm/i915/selftests: Exercise resetting during non-user payloads

In selftests/live_hangcheck, we have a lot of tests for resetting simple
spinners, but nothing quite prepared us for how the GPU reacted to
triggering a reset outside of the safe spinner. These two subtests fill
the ring with plain old empty, non-spinning requests, and then triggers
a reset. Without a user-payload to blame, these requests will exercise
the 'non-started' paths and mostly be replayed verbatim.
