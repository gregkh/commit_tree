fs/fat/file.c: issue flush after the writeback of FAT

fsync() needs to make sure the data & meta-data of file are persistent
after the return of fsync(), even when a power-failure occurs later.  In
the case of fat-fs, the FAT belongs to the meta-data of file, so we need
to issue a flush after the writeback of FAT instead before.

Also bail out early when any stage of fsync fails.
