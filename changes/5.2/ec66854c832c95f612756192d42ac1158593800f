mpls: fix af_mpls dependencies for real

Randy reported that selecting MPLS_ROUTING without PROC_FS breaks
the build, because since commit c1a9d65954c6 ("mpls: fix af_mpls
dependencies"), MPLS_ROUTING selects PROC_SYSCTL, but Kconfig's select
doesn't recursively handle dependencies.
Change the select into a dependency.
