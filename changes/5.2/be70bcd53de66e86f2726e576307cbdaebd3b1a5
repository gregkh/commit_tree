bpf: do not retain flags that are not tied to map lifetime

Both BPF_F_WRONLY / BPF_F_RDONLY flags are tied to the map file
descriptor, but not to the map object itself! Meaning, at map
creation time BPF_F_RDONLY can be set to make the map read-only
from syscall side, but this holds only for the returned fd, so
any other fd either retrieved via bpf file system or via map id
for the very same underlying map object can have read-write access
instead.

Given that, keeping the two flags around in the map_flags attribute
and exposing them to user space upon map dump is misleading and
may lead to false conclusions. Since these two flags are not
tied to the map object lets also not store them as map property.
