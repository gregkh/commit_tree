scsi: qedi: Adjust termination and offload ramrod timers

Whenever offload ramrod is issued, firmware wants driver to wait for max 5
secs, otherwise driver can initiate further corrective action. Similarly,
when termination ramrod is issued, irrespective of abortive or non-abortive
termination, driver should wait for 60 sec * max TCP-RT timeout.
