ASoC: SOF: core: fix error handling with the probe workqueue

In some configurations, it's a requirement to split the probe in two,
with a second part handled in a workqueue (e.g. for HDMI support
which depends on the DRM modules).

SOF already handles these configurations but the error flow is
incorrect. When an error occurs in the workqueue, the probe has
technically already completed. If we release the resources on errors,
this generates kernel oops/use-after-free when the resources are
released a second time on module removal.
