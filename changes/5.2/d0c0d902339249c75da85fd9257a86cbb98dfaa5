scsi: bnx2fc: fix incorrect cast to u64 on shift operation

Currently an int is being shifted and the result is being cast to a u64
which leads to undefined behaviour if the shift is more than 31 bits. Fix
this by casting the integer value 1 to u64 before the shift operation.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Bad shift operation")
