s390/qeth: add TX multiqueue support for IQD devices

qeth has been supporting multiple HW Output Queues for a long time. But
rather than exposing those queues to the stack, it uses its own queue
selection logic in .ndo_start_xmit... with all the drawbacks that
entails.
Start off by switching IQD devices over to a proper mqs net_device,
and converting all the netdev_queue management code.

One oddity with IQD devices is the requirement to place all mcast
traffic on the _highest_ established HW queue. Doing so via
.ndo_select_queue seems straight-forward - but that won't work if only
some of the HW queues are active
(ie. when dev->real_num_tx_queues < dev->num_tx_queues), since
netdev_cap_txqueue() will not allow us to put skbs on the higher queues.

To make this work, we
1. let .ndo_select_queue() map all mcast traffic to netdev_queue 0, and
2. later re-map the netdev_queue and HW queue indices in
   .ndo_start_xmit and the TX completion handler.

With this patch we default to a fixed set of 1 ucast and 1 mcast queue.
Support for dynamic reconfiguration is added at a later time.
