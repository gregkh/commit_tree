ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-stream: handle real stream interrupts only

The stream and IPC share the same interrupt. The stream interrupt
handler mistakenly uses the ipc interrupt and return IRQ_HANDLED,
causing the ipc interrupt to be missed.

Make sure the stream interrupt handler only deals with stream-related
interrupts.
