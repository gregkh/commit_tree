net: hsr: fix placement of logical operator in a multi-line statement

In a multi-line statement exceeding 80 characters, logical operator
should be at the end of a line instead of being at the start. This
is seen when ran checkpatch.pl -f on files under net/hsr. The change
is per suggestion from checkpatch.
