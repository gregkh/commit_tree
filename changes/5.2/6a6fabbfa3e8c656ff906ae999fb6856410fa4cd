net/mlx5: Update pci error handler entries and command translation

Add missing entries for create/destroy UCTX and UMEM commands.
This could get us wrong "unknown FW command" error in flows
where we unbind the device or reset the driver.

Also the translation of these commands from opcodes to string
was missing.

Fixes: 6e3722baac04 ("IB/mlx5: Use the correct commands for UMEM and UCTX allocation")
