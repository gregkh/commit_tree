ovl: do not generate duplicate fsnotify events for "fake" path

Overlayfs "fake" path is used for stacked file operations on underlying
files.  Operations on files with "fake" path must not generate fsnotify
events with path data, because those events have already been generated at
overlayfs layer and because the reported event->fd for fanotify marks on
underlying inode/filesystem will have the wrong path (the overlayfs path).
