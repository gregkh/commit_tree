x86/microcode/intel: Refactor Intel microcode blob loading

Change generic_load_microcode() to use the iov_iter API instead of a
clumsy open-coded version which has to pay attention to __user data
or kernel data, depending on the loading method. This allows to avoid
explicit casting between user and kernel pointers.

Because the iov_iter API makes it hard to read the same location twice,
as a side effect, also fix a double-read of the microcode header (which
could e.g. lead to out-of-bounds reads in microcode_sanity_check()).

Not that it matters much, only root is allowed to load microcode
anyway...
