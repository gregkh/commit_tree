arm64: KVM: Add accessors to track guest/host only counters

In order to effeciently switch events_{guest,host} perf counters at
guest entry/exit we add bitfields to kvm_cpu_context for guest and host
events as well as accessors for updating them.

A function is also provided which allows the PMU driver to determine
if a counter should start counting when it is enabled. With exclude_host,
we may only start counting when entering the guest.
