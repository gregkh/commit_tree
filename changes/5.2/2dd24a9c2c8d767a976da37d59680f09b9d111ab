drm/i915/gen11+: First assume next platforms will inherit stuff

This exactly same approach was already used from gen9
to gen10 and from gen10 to gen11. Let's also use it
for gen11+.

Let's first assume that we inherit a similar platform
and than we apply the differences on top.

Different from the previous attempts this will be
done this time with coccinelle. We obviously need to
exclude some case that is really exclusive for gen11
like  PCH, Firmware, and few others. Luckly this was
easy to filter by selecting the files we are touching
with coccinelle as exposed below:

spatch -sp_file gen11\+.cocci --in-place i915_perf.c \
       intel_bios.c intel_cdclk.c intel_ddi.c \
       intel_device_info.c intel_display.c intel_dpll_mgr.c \
       intel_dsi_vbt.c intel_hdmi.c intel_mocs.c intel_color.c

No functional change.

v2: Remove intel_lrc.c per Tvrtko request since those were w/a
    for ICL hw issuea and media related configuration.
