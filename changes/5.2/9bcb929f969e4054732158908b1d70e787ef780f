perf/arm-ccn: Clean up CPU hotplug handling

Like arm-cci, arm-ccn has the same issue of disabling preemption around
operations which can take mutexes. Again, remove the definite bug by
simply not trying to fight the theoretical races. And since we are
touching the hotplug handling code, take the opportunity to streamline
it, as there's really no need to store a full-sized cpumask to keep
track of a single CPU ID.
