thunderbolt: Add support for DMA tunnels

In addition to PCIe and Display Port tunnels it is also possible to
create tunnels that forward DMA traffic from the host interface adapter
(NHI) to a NULL port that is connected to another domain through a
Thunderbolt cable. These tunnels can be used to carry software messages
such as networking packets.

To support this we introduce another tunnel type (TB_TUNNEL_DMA) that
supports paths from NHI to NULL port and back.
