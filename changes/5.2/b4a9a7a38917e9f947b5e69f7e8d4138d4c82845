bus: ti-sysc: Handle swsup idle mode quirks

In preparation of dropping interconnect target module platform data in
favor of devicetree based data, we must pass swsup idle quirks to the
platform data functions.

For now, let's only tag the UART modules with the SWSUP_SIDLE_ACT quirk.
The other modules will get tagged with swsup quirks as we drop the
platform data and test the changes.
