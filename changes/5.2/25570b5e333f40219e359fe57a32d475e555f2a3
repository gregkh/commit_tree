drm/arm/malidp: Added support for AFBC modifiers for all layers except DE_SMART

The list of modifiers to be supported for each plane has been dynamically generated
from 'malidp_format_modifiers[]' and 'malidp_hw_regmap->features'.

Changes from v1:-
1. Replaced DRM_ERROR() with DRM_DEBUG_KMS() in malidp_format_mod_supported()
to report unsupported modifiers.

Changes from v2:-
1. Removed malidp_format_mod_supported() from the current patch. This has been added
in "PATCH 7/12"
2. Dynamically generate the list of modifiers (to be supported for each plane) from
'malidp_format_modifiers' and features.

Changes since v3 (series):
- Added the ack
- Rebased on the latest drm-misc-next
