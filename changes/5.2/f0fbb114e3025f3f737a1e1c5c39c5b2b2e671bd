perf stat: Implement duration_time as a proper event

The perf metric expression use 'duration_time' internally to normalize
events.  Normal 'perf stat' without -x also prints the duration time.
But when using -x, the interval is not output anywhere, which is
inconvenient for any post processing which often wants to normalize
values to time.

So implement 'duration_time' as a proper perf event that can be
specified explicitely with -e.

The previous implementation of 'duration_time' only worked for metric
processing. This adds the concept of a tool event that is handled by the
tool. On the kernel level it is still mapped to the dummy software
event, but the values are not read anymore, but instead computed by the
tool.

Add proper plumbing to handle this in the event parser, and display it
in 'perf stat'. We don't want 'duration_time' to be added up, so it's
only printed for the first CPU.

% perf stat -e duration_time,cycles true

 Performance counter stats for 'true':

           555,476 ns   duration_time
           771,958      cycles

       0.000555476 seconds time elapsed

       0.000644000 seconds user
       0.000000000 seconds sys
