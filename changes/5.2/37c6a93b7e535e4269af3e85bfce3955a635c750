drm/amd/display: Expose support for NV12 on suitable planes

[Why]
Hardware can support video surfaces and DC tells us which planes are
suitable via DC plane caps.

[How]
The supported formats array will now vary based on what DC tells us,
so create an array and fill it dynamically based on plane types and
caps.

Ideally we'd query support for every format via DC plane caps, but for
the framework is in place to do so later with this.
