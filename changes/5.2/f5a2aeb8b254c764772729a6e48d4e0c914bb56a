crypto: ccp - Do not free psp_master when PLATFORM_INIT fails

Currently, we free the psp_master if the PLATFORM_INIT fails during the
SEV FW probe. If psp_master is freed then driver does not invoke the PSP
FW. As per SEV FW spec, there are several commands (PLATFORM_RESET,
PLATFORM_STATUS, GET_ID etc) which can be executed in the UNINIT state
We should not free the psp_master when PLATFORM_INIT fails.
