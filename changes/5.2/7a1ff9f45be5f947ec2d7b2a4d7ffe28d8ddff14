mlxsw: spectrum_buffers: Adjust CPU port shared buffer egress quotas

Switch the CPU port to use the new dedicated egress pool instead the
previously used egress pool which was shared with normal front panel
ports.

Add per-port quotas for the amount of traffic that can be buffered for
the CPU port and also adjust the per-{port, TC} quotas.
