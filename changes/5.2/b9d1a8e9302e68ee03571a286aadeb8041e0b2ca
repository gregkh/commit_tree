kconfig: use snprintf for formatting pathnames

Valid pathnames will never exceed PATH_MAX, but these file names
are unsanitized and can cause buffer overflow if set incorrectly.
Use snprintf to avoid this. This was flagged during a Coverity scan
of the coreboot project, which also uses kconfig for its build system.
