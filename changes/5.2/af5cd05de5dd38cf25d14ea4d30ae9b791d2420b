powerpc: Fix defconfig choice logic when cross compiling

Our logic for choosing defconfig doesn't work well in some situations.

For example if you're on a ppc64le machine but you specify a non-empty
CROSS_COMPILE, in order to use a non-default toolchain, then defconfig
will give you ppc64_defconfig (big endian):

  $ make CROSS_COMPILE=~/toolchains/gcc-8/bin/powerpc-linux- defconfig
  *** Default configuration is based on 'ppc64_defconfig'

This is because we assume that CROSS_COMPILE being set means we
can't be on a ppc machine and rather than checking we just default to
ppc64_defconfig.

We should just ignore CROSS_COMPILE, instead check the machine with
uname and if it's one of ppc, ppc64 or ppc64le then use that
defconfig. If it's none of those then we fall back to ppc64_defconfig.
