drm/amd/display: Update plane scaling parameters for fast updates

[Why]
Plane scaling parameters are not correctly filled or updated when
performing fast updates.

They're filled when creating the dc plane state and during atomic check.

While the atomic check code path happens for the plane even during fast
updates, the issue is that they're done in place on the dc_plane_state
directly. This dc_plane_state may be the current state plane state
being used by the hardware, so these parameters won't be correctly
programmed.

The new scaling parameters should instead be passed as an update
to the plane.

[How]
Update fill_rects_from_plane_state to not modify dc_plane_state
directly. Update the call sites that use this to fill in the appropriate
values.
