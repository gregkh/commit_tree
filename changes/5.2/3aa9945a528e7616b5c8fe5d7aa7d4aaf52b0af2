drm/i915: Separate GEM context construction and registration to userspace

In later patches, it became apparent that userspace can see a partially
constructed GEM context and begin using it before it was ready, to much
hilarity. Close this window of opportunity by lifting the registration of
the context with userspace (the insertion of the context into the filp's
idr) to the very end of the CONTEXT_CREATE ioctl.
