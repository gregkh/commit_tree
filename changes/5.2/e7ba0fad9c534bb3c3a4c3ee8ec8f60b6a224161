net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: refine SMI support

The Marvell SOHO switches have several ways to access the internal
registers. One of them being the System Management Interface (SMI),
using the MDC and MDIO pins, with direct and indirect variants.

In preparation for adding support for other register accesses, move
the SMI code into its own files. At the same time, refine the code
to make it clear that the indirect variant is implemented using the
direct variant accessing only two registers for command and data.
