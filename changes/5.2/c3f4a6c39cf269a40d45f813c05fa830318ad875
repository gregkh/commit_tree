net/tls: don't ignore netdev notifications if no TLS features

On device surprise removal path (the notifier) we can't
bail just because the features are disabled.  They may
have been enabled during the lifetime of the device.
This bug leads to leaking netdev references and
use-after-frees if there are active connections while
device features are cleared.
