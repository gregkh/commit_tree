Revert "block: unexport DISK_EVENT_MEDIA_CHANGE for legacy/fringe drivers"

This reverts commit 9fd097b14918875bd6f125ed699d7bbbba5893ee.

Instead of leaving disk->events completely empty, we now export the
supported events again, and tell the block layer not to forward events to
user space by not setting DISK_EVENT_FLAG_UEVENT. This allows the block
layer to distinguish between devices that for which events should be
handled in kernel only, and devices which don't support any meda change
events at all.
