s390/qdio: allow to scan all Output SBALs in one go

Old code restricted the number of inspected SBALs to
QDIO_MAX_BUFFERS_PER_Q - 1, as otherwise the first_to_check and
first_to_kick cursors could overlap. Subsequent code would then assume that
there was no progress on the queue, when in fact _all_ SBALs on the queue
were ready-to-process.

This limitation no longer applies, so allow the queue-scan code to inspect
all SBALs on the queue. Note that qeth requires an additional patch
("s390/qeth: stop/wake TX queues based on their fill level"), to avoid
potential queue stalls when all 128 SBALs are reported as ready-to-process.
