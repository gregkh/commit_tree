cpufreq/pasemi: fix possible object reference leak

The call to of_get_cpu_node returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented thus it must be explicitly decremented after the last
usage.

Detected by coccinelle with the following warnings:
./drivers/cpufreq/pasemi-cpufreq.c:212:1-7: ERROR: missing of_node_put; acquired a node pointer with refcount incremented on line 147, but without a corresponding object release within this function.
./drivers/cpufreq/pasemi-cpufreq.c:220:1-7: ERROR: missing of_node_put; acquired a node pointer with refcount incremented on line 147, but without a corresponding object release within this function.
