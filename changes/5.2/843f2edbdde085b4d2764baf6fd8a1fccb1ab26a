lightnvm: do not remove instance under global lock

Currently all the target instances are removed under global nvm_lock.
This was needed to ensure that nvm_dev struct will not be freed by
hot unplug event during target removal. However, current implementation
has some drawbacks, since the same lock is used when new nvme subsystem
is registered, so we can have a situation, that due to long process of
target removal on drive A, registration (and listing in OS) of the
drive B will take a lot of time, since it will wait for that lock.

Now when we have kref which ensures that nvm_dev will not be freed in
the meantime, we can easily get rid of this lock for a time when we are
removing nvm targets.
