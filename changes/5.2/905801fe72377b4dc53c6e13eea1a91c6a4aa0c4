drm/i915: Force 2*96 MHz cdclk on glk/cnl when audio power is enabled

CDCLK has to be at least twice the BLCK regardless of audio. Audio
driver has to probe using this hook and increase the clock even in
absence of any display.

v2: Use atomic refcount for get_power, put_power so that we can
    call each once(Abhay).
v3: Reset power well 2 to avoid any transaction on iDisp link
    during cdclk change(Abhay).
v4: Remove Power well 2 reset workaround(Ville).
v5: Remove unwanted Power well 2 register defined in v4(Abhay).
v6:
- Use a dedicated flag instead of state->modeset for min CDCLK changes
- Make get/put audio power domain symmetric
- Rebased on top of intel_wakeref tracking changes.
