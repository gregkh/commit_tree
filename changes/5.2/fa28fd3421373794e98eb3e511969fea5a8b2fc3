spi: tegra114: add support for interrupt mask

This patch creates tegra_spi_soc_data structure to maintain and implement
SPI HW feature differences between different Tegra chips and also creates
a separate compatible string for T124/T210.

Tegra210 and later has a separate interrupt mask register SPI_INTR_MASK
for enabling or disabling interrupts while Tegra124 and prior uses
interrupt enable bits in SPI_DMA_CTL register.

This patch creates flag has_intr_mask_reg in tegra_spi_soc_data to
identify this and implements accordingly.
