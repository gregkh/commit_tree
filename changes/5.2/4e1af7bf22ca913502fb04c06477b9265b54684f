ice: Fix issue with VF attempt to delete default MAC address

This patch fixes issue that occurs when VF is attempting to remove
default LAN/MAC address, which is programmed by the administrator.
We shouldn't return error for the call by the VF, but continue with
the remaining steps to handle MAC opcode. Also update the dev_err
message to explicitly say that VF can't change MAC programmed by PF.

Also change "mac" to "MAC" for kernel print statements in the same file.
