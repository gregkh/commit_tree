selftests: Add debugging options to pmtu.sh

pmtu.sh script runs a number of tests and dumps a summary of pass/fail.
If a test fails, it is near impossible to debug why. For example:

    TEST: ipv6: PMTU exceptions                       [FAIL]

There are a lot of commands run behind the scenes for this test. Which
one is failing?

Add a VERBOSE option to show commands that are run and any output from
those commands. Add a PAUSE_ON_FAIL option to halt the script if a test
fails allowing users to poke around with the setup in the failed state.

In the process, rename tracing to TRACING and move declaration to top
with the new variables.
