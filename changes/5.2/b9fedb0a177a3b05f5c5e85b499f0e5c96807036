iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: inline per-sensor data

As it has been already done for other st sensors in 'commit 9049531c91b4
("iio: accel: st_accel: inline per-sensor data")', get rid of some
defines and just open code the values into the appropriate struct
elements since the semantic meaning is inherent in the name of the
C99-addressable fields and there is no reason to duplicate the code
