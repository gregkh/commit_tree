x86/microcode: Fix the ancient deprecated microcode loading method

Commit

  2613f36ed965 ("x86/microcode: Attempt late loading only when new microcode is present")

added the new define UCODE_NEW to denote that an update should happen
only when newer microcode (than installed on the system) has been found.

But it missed adjusting that for the old /dev/cpu/microcode loading
interface. Fix it.
