btrfs: tree-checker: Verify inode item

There is a report in kernel bugzilla about mismatch file type in dir
item and inode item.

This inspires us to check inode mode in inode item.

This patch will check the following members:

- inode key objectid
  Should be ROOT_DIR_DIR or [256, (u64)-256] or FREE_INO.

- inode key offset
  Should be 0

- inode item generation
- inode item transid
  No newer than sb generation + 1.
  The +1 is for log tree.

- inode item mode
  No unknown bits.
  No invalid S_IF* bit.
  NOTE: S_IFMT check is not enough, need to check every know type.

- inode item nlink
  Dir should have no more link than 1.

- inode item flags
