block: sed-opal: fix IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR

The implementation of IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR handled the value
opal_mbr_data.enable_disable incorrectly: enable_disable is expected
to be one of OPAL_MBR_ENABLE(0) or OPAL_MBR_DISABLE(1). enable_disable
was passed directly to set_mbr_done and set_mbr_enable_disable where
is was interpreted as either OPAL_TRUE(1) or OPAL_FALSE(0). The end
result was that calling IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR with OPAL_MBR_ENABLE
actually disabled the shadow MBR and vice versa.

This patch adds correct conversion from OPAL_MBR_DISABLE/ENABLE to
OPAL_FALSE/TRUE. The change affects existing programs using
IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR but this is typically used only once when
setting up an Opal drive.
