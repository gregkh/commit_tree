intel_th: msu: Fix single mode with IOMMU

Currently, the pages that are allocated for the single mode of MSC are not
mapped into the device's dma space and the code is incorrectly using
*_to_phys() in place of a dma address. This fails with IOMMU enabled and
is otherwise bad practice.

Fix the single mode buffer allocation to map the pages into the device's
DMA space.
