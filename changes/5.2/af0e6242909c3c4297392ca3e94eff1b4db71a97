spi: spi-fsl-spi: automatically adapt bits-per-word in cpu mode

Taking one interrupt for every byte is rather slow. Since the
controller is perfectly capable of transmitting 32 bits at a time,
change t->bits_per-word to 32 when the length is divisible by 4 and
large enough that the reduced number of interrupts easily compensates
for the one or two extra fsl_spi_setup_transfer() calls this causes.
