ARM: tegra: enforce PM requirement

Currently runtime PM is enabled for Tegra HDA driver. One of the concern
raised was about handling !PM case in HDA driver. In this case, there is
a need to manage clocks and power explicitly in the driver and reviewers
were not really convinced about this. The consensus at the end was to
enforce PM requirement to keep things simple, rather driver mentioning a
dependency on PM. This is how it is done for ARM 64-bit Tegra platforms
and the same can be done for 32-bit Tegra platforms too.

Finally the objective is to remove dependency on PM availability for all
Tegra drivers. The detailed discussion can be found in following patch,
