ide: officially deprecated the legacy IDE driver

After a recent chat with Dave we agreed to try to finally kill off the
legacy IDE code base.  Set a two year grace period in which we try
to move everyone over.  There are a few pieces of hardware not
supported by libata yet, but for many of them we aren't even sure
if there are any users.  For those that have users we have usually
found a volunteer to add libata support.
