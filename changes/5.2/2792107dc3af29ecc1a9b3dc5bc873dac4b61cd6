x86/Kconfig: Deprecate DISCONTIGMEM support for 32-bit x86

Mel Gorman says:

  "32-bit NUMA systems should be non-existent in practice.  The last NUMA
   system I'm aware of that was both NUMA and 32-bit only died somewhere
   between 2004 and 2007. If someone is running a 64-bit capable system in
   32-bit mode with NUMA, they really are just punishing themselves for fun."

Mark DISCONTIGMEM broken for now as suggested by Christoph Hellwig,
and (hopefully) remove it in a couple of releases.
