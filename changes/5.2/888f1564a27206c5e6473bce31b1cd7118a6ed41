qtnfmac: allow to control DFS slave radar detection

In ETSI region DFS slave device can operate in two modes on DFS channels:
 - do on-channel radar detection and use higher Tx power
 - don't do radar detection and use lower Tx power as a consequence

Allow user to control that behavior through qtnfmac module parameter.
