crypto: testmgr - fuzz AEADs against their generic implementation

When the extra crypto self-tests are enabled, test each AEAD algorithm
against its generic implementation when one is available.  This
involves: checking the algorithm properties for consistency, then
randomly generating test vectors using the generic implementation and
running them against the implementation under test.  Both good and bad
inputs are tested.
