arm64: ssbd: explicitly depend on <linux/prctl.h>

Fix ssbd.c which depends implicitly on asm/ptrace.h including
linux/prctl.h (through for example linux/compat.h, then linux/time.h,
linux/seqlock.h, linux/spinlock.h and linux/irqflags.h), and uses
PR_SPEC* defines.

This is an issue since we'll soon be removing the include from
asm/ptrace.h.
