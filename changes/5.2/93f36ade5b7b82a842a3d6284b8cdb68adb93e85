thunderbolt: Generalize tunnel creation functionality

To be able to tunnel non-PCIe traffic, separate tunnel functionality
into generic and PCIe specific parts. Rename struct tb_pci_tunnel to
tb_tunnel, and make it hold an array of paths instead of just two.
Update all the tunneling functions to take this structure as parameter.

We also move tb_pci_port_active() to switch.c (and rename it) where we
will be keeping all port and switch related functions.
