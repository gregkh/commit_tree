IB/mlx5: Add missing XRC options to QP optional params mask

The QP transition optional parameters for the various transition for XRC
QPs are identical to those for RC QPs.

Many of the XRC QP transition optional parameter bits are missing from the
QP optional mask table.  These omissions caused failures when doing XRC QP
state transitions.

For example, when trying to change the response timer of an XRC receive QP
via the RTS2RTS transition, the new timer value was ignored because
MLX5_QP_OPTPAR_RNR_TIMEOUT bit was missing from the optional params mask
for XRC qps for the RTS2RTS transition.

Fix this by adding the missing XRC optional parameters for all QP
transitions to the opt_mask table.
