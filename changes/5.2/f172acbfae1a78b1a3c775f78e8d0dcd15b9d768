powerpc/mm: move warning from resize_hpt_for_hotplug()

resize_hpt_for_hotplug() reports a warning when it cannot
resize the hash page table ("Unable to resize hash page
table to target order") but in some cases it's not a problem
and can make user thinks something has not worked properly.

This patch moves the warning to arch_remove_memory() to
only report the problem when it is needed.
