ice: remove redundant variable and if condition

In ice_pf_rxq_wait we are using an unnecessary local variable and also
we are checking if the timeout time was reached after the loop. Get rid
of the local variable and return 0 right when we get a successful
result. This makes it so we can return -ETIMEDOUT if we ever exit the
loop because we know the timeout time has been hit.
