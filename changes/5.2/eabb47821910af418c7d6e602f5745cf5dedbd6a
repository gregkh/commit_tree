netfilter: xt_hashlimit: use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace code of the following form:

sizeof(struct xt_hashlimit_htable) + sizeof(struct hlist_head) * size

with:

struct_size(hinfo, hash, size)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
