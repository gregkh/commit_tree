ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Model DAC/ADC dividers in CCF

Model and manage DAC/ADC dividers as components in the Core
Clock Framework.  This should allow us to do some more complex
clock management and power control.  Also, some of the
on-board chip clocks can be exposed to the outside, and this
change will make those clocks easier to consume by other
parts of the kernel.
