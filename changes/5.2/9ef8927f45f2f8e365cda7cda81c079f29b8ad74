n_tty: check for negative and zero space return from tty_write_room

The return from tty_write_room could potentially be negative if
a tty write_room driver returns an error number (not that any seem
to do). Rather than just check for a zero return, also check for
a -ve return. This avoids the unsigned nr being set to a large unsigned
value on the assignment from variable space and can lead to overflowing
the buffer buf.  Better to be safe than assume all write_room
implementations in tty drivers are going to do the right thing.
