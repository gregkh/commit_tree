vfs: syscall: Add move_mount(2) to move mounts around

Add a move_mount() system call that will move a mount from one place to
another and, in the next commit, allow to attach an unattached mount tree.

The new system call looks like the following:

	int move_mount(int from_dfd, const char *from_path,
		       int to_dfd, const char *to_path,
		       unsigned int flags);
