ASoC: fsl_asrc: Fix the issue about unsupported rate

When the output sample rate is [8kHz, 30kHz], the limitation
of the supported ratio range is [1/24, 8]. In the driver
we use (8kHz, 30kHz) instead of [8kHz, 30kHz].
So this patch is to fix this issue and the potential rounding
issue with divider.

output sample rate")
