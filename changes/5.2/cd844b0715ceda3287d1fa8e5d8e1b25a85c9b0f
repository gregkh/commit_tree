irqchip/ti-sci-intr: Add support for Interrupt Router driver

Texas Instruments' K3 generation SoCs has an IP Interrupt Router
that does allows for redirection of input interrupts to host
interrupt controller. Interrupt Router inputs are either from a
peripheral or from an Interrupt Aggregator which is another
interrupt controller.

Configuration of the interrupt router registers can only be done by
a system co-processor and the driver needs to send a message to this
co processor over TISCI protocol.

Add support for Interrupt Router driver over TISCI protocol.
