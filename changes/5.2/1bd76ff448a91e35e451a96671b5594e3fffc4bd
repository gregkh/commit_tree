EDAC, altera: Fix S10 Double Bit Error Notification

Stratix10 Double Bit Error Address was always read from SDRAM Address
register instead of each device's Address register.

To determine which device had the DBE, cycle through the EDAC devices
comparing the DBE value to the db_irq value. Once found, report the DBE
Address from the device registers as well as the device name.

Finally, notify the system via an SMC call and indicate the panic should
result in a system reboot. Change a run-time check to a Stratix10
compile-time check for a clean SMC notification.
