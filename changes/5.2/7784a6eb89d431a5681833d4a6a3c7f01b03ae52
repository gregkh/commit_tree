ARM: dts: at91: sama5d2_xplained: Add proper regulator states for suspend-to-mem

When entering suspend-to-mem, all PMIC outputs are disabled except
VDDIODDR which is put in power saving mode, and whose voltage is
increased (probably to counter the poor accuracy of power saving mode).

 regulator-suspend-max-microvolt, regulator-suspend-max-microvolt,
 use macros for regulators' states, add regulator-inital-state]
