ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirks for several Clevo notebook barebones

This adds 4 SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) lines for several barebone models of the ODM
Clevo. The model names are written in regex syntax to describe/match all clevo
models that are similar enough and use the same PCI SSID that this fixup works
for them.

Additionally the lines regarding SSID 0x96e1 and 0x97e1 didn't fix audio for the
all our Clevo notebooks using these SSIDs (models Clevo P960* and P970*) since
ALC1220_FIXP_CLEVO_PB51ED_PINS swapped pins that are not necesarry to be
swapped. This patch initiates ALC1220_FIXUP_CLEVO_P950 instead for these model
and fixes the audio.
