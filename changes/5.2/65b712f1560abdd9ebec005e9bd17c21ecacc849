KVM: nVMX: Allow restore nested-state to enable eVMCS when vCPU in SMM

As comment in code specifies, SMM temporarily disables VMX so we cannot
be in guest mode, nor can VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME be pending.

However, code currently assumes that these are the only flags that can be
set on kvm_state->flags. This is not true as KVM_STATE_NESTED_EVMCS
can also be set on this field to signal that eVMCS should be enabled.

Therefore, fix code to check for guest-mode and pending VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME
explicitly.
