drm/msm/a6xx: No zap shader is not an error

Depending on platform firmware, a zap shader may not be required to take
the GPU out of secure mode on boot, in which case we can just write
RBBM_SECVID_TRUST_CNTL directly.  Which we *mostly* handled, but missed
clearing 'ret' resulting that hw_init() returned an error on these
devices.
