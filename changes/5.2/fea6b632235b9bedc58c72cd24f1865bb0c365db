tools lib traceevent: Remove call to exit() from tep_filter_add_filter_str()

This patch removes call to exit() from tep_filter_add_filter_str(). A
library function should not force the application to exit. In the
current implementation tep_filter_add_filter_str() calls exit() when a
special "test_filters" mode is set, used only for debugging purposes.
When this mode is set and a filter is added - its string is printed to
the console and exit() is called. This patch changes the logic - when in
"test_filters" mode, the filter string is still printed, but the exit()
is not called. It is up to the application to track when "test_filters"
mode is set and to call exit, if needed.
