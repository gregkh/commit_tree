clk: Remove CLK_IS_BASIC clk flag

This flag was historically used to indicate that a clk is a "basic" type
of clk like a mux, divider, gate, etc. This never turned out to be very
useful though because it was hard to cleanly split "basic" clks from
other clks in a system. This one flag was a way for type introspection
and it just didn't scale. If anything, it was used by the TI clk driver
to indicate that a clk_hw wasn't contained in the SoC specific clk
structure. We can get rid of this define now that TI is finding those
clks a different way.
