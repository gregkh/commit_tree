net: hns3: handle the BD info on the last BD of the packet

The bdinfo handled in hns3_handle_bdinfo is only valid on the
last BD of the current packet, currently the bd info may be handled
based on the first BD if the packet has more than two BDs, which
may cause rx error.

This patch fixes it by using the last BD of the current packet in
hns3_handle_bdinfo.

Also, hns3_set_rx_skb_rss_type has used RSS hash value from the last
BD of the current packet, so remove the same last BD calculation in
hns3_set_rx_skb_rss_type and call it from hns3_handle_bdinfo.
