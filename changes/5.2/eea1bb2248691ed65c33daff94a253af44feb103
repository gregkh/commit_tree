arm64: mm: check virtual addr in virt_to_page() if CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL=y

This change uses the original virt_to_page() (the one with __pa()) to
check the given virtual address if CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL=y.

Recently, I worked on a bug: a driver passes a symbol address to
dma_map_single() and the virt_to_page() (called by dma_map_single())
does not work for non-linear addresses after commit 9f2875912dac
("arm64: mm: restrict virt_to_page() to the linear mapping").

I tried to trap the bug by enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL but it
did not work - bacause the commit removes the __pa() from
virt_to_page() but CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL checks the virtual address
in __pa()/__virt_to_phys().

A simple solution is to use the original virt_to_page()
(the one with__pa()) if CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL=y.
