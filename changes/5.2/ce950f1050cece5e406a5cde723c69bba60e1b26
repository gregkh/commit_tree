sctp: Free cookie before we memdup a new one

Based on comments from Xin, even after fixes for our recent syzbot
report of cookie memory leaks, its possible to get a resend of an INIT
chunk which would lead to us leaking cookie memory.

To ensure that we don't leak cookie memory, free any previously
allocated cookie first.

Change notes
v1->v2
update subsystem tag in subject (davem)
repeat kfree check for peer_random and peer_hmacs (xin)

v2->v3
net->sctp
also free peer_chunks

v3->v4
fix subject tags

v4->v5
remove cut line
