KVM: arm/arm64: Fix emulated ptimer irq injection

The emulated ptimer needs to track the level changes, otherwise the
the interrupt will never get deasserted, resulting in the guest getting
stuck in an interrupt storm if it enables ptimer interrupts. This was
found with kvm-unit-tests; the ptimer tests hung as soon as interrupts
were enabled. Typical Linux guests don't have a problem as they prefer
using the virtual timer.
