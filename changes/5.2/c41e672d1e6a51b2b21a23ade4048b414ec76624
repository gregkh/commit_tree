net: hns3: set dividual reset level for all RAS and MSI-X errors

According to hardware description, reset level that should be
triggered are not consistent in a module. For example, in SSU
common errors, the first two bits has no need to do reset,
but the other bits need global reset.

This patch sets separate reset level for all RAS and MSI-X
interrupts by adding a reset_lvel field in struct hclge_hw_error,
and fixes some incorrect reset level.
