drm/i915/crc: Make IPS workaround generic

Other features like PSR2 also needs to be disabled while getting CRC
so lets rename ips_force_disable to crc_enabled, drop all this checks
for pipe A and HSW and BDW and make it generic and
hsw_compute_ips_config() will take care of all the checks removed
from here.
