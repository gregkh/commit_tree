block: force an unlimited segment size on queues with a virt boundary

We currently fail to update the front/back segment size in the bio when
deciding to allow an otherwise gappy segement to a device with a
virt boundary.  The reason why this did not cause problems is that
devices with a virt boundary fundamentally don't use segments as we
know it and thus don't care.  Make that assumption formal by forcing
an unlimited segement size in this case.
