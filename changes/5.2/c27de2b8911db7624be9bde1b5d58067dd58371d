tools headers UAPI: Sync linux/sched.h with the kernel

To pick up the change in:

  b3e583825266 ("clone: add CLONE_PIDFD")

This requires changes in the 'perf trace' beautification routines for
the 'clone' syscall args, which is done in a followup patch.

This silences the following perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/sched.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/sched.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/sched.h include/uapi/linux/sched.h
