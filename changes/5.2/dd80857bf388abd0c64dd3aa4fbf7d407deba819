net/mlx5: Avoid reloading already removed devices

Prior to reloading a device we must first verify that it was not already
removed. Otherwise, the attempt to remove the device will do nothing, and
in that case we will end up proceeding with adding an new device that no
one was expecting to remove, leaving behind used resources such as EQs that
causes a failure to destroy comp EQs and syndrome (0x30f433).

Fix that by making sure that we try to remove and add a device (based on a
protocol) only if the device is already added.
