ubifs: work around high stack usage with clang

Building this file with clang can result in large stack usage as seen from
this warning:

fs/ubifs/auth.c:78:5: error: stack frame size of 1152 bytes in function 'ubifs_prepare_auth_node'

The problem is that inlining ubifs_hash_calc_hmac() leads to
two SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK() blocks in the same function, and clang
for some reason does not reuse the stack space as it should.

Putting the first declaration into a separate basic block avoids
this problem and reduces the stack allocation to 640 bytes.
