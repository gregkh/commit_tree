KVM/nVMX: Use kvm_vcpu_map when mapping the posted interrupt descriptor table

Use kvm_vcpu_map when mapping the posted interrupt descriptor table since
using kvm_vcpu_gpa_to_page() and kmap() will only work for guest memory
that has a "struct page".

One additional semantic change is that the virtual host mapping lifecycle
has changed a bit. It now has the same lifetime of the pinning of the
interrupt descriptor table page on the host side.
