libbpf: move logging helpers into libbpf_internal.h

libbpf_util.h header was recently exposed as public as a dependency of
xsk.h. In addition to memory barriers, it contained logging helpers,
which are not supposed to be exposed. This patch moves those into
libbpf_internal.h, which is kept as an internal header.
