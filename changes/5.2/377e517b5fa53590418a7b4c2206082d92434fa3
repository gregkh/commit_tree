mtd: nand: Add max_bad_eraseblocks_per_lun info to memorg

NAND datasheets usually give the maximum number of bad blocks per LUN
and this number can be used to help upper layers decide how much blocks
they should reserve for bad block handling.

Add a max_bad_eraseblocks_per_lun to the nand_memory_organization
struct and update the NAND_MEMORG() macro (and its users) accordingly.

We also provide a default mtd->_max_bad_blocks() implementation.
