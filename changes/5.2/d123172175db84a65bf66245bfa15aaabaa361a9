qtnfmac: make regulatory notifier work on per-phy basis

Wireless core calls regulatory notifier for each wiphy and it only
guarantees that bands info is updated for this particular wiphy prior
to calling a notifier. Hence updating all wiphy which belong to driver
in a single notifier callback is redundant and incorrect.
