list: Don't use WRITE_ONCE() in hlist_add_behind()

Commit 1c97be677f72b3 ("list: Use WRITE_ONCE() when adding to lists and
hlists") introduced the use of WRITE_ONCE() to atomically write the list
head's ->next pointer.

hlist_add_behind() doesn't touch the hlist head's ->first pointer so
there is no reason to use WRITE_ONCE() in this case.
