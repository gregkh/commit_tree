hwmon: (occ) Store error condition for rate-limited polls

The OCC driver limits the rate of sending poll commands to the OCC. If a
user reads a hwmon entry after a poll response resulted in an error and
is rate-limited, the error is invisible to the user. Fix this by storing
the last error and returning that in the rate-limited case.
