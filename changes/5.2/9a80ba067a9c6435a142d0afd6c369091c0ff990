net: xilinx: emaclite: add minimal ethtool ops

This set adds a minimal set of ethtool hooks to the driver, which provide a
decent amount of link information via ethtool.
With this change, running `ethtool ethX` in user-space provides all the
neatly-formatted information about the link (what was negotiated, what is
advertised, etc).
