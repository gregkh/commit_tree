mm: move recent_rotated pages calculation to shrink_inactive_list()

Patch series "mm: Generalize putback functions"]

putback_inactive_pages() and move_active_pages_to_lru() are almost
similar, so this patchset merges them ina single function.

This patch (of 4):

The patch moves the calculation from putback_inactive_pages() to
shrink_inactive_list().  This makes putback_inactive_pages() looking more
similar to move_active_pages_to_lru().

To do that, we account activated pages in reclaim_stat::nr_activate.
Since a page may change its LRU type from anon to file cache inside
shrink_page_list() (see ClearPageSwapBacked()), we have to account pages
for the both types.  So, nr_activate becomes an array.

Previously we used nr_activate to account PGACTIVATE events, but now we
account them into pgactivate variable (since they are about number of
pages in general, not about sum of hpage_nr_pages).
