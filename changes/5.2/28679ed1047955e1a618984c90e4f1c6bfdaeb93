ipv6: Refactor find_match

find_match primarily needs a fib6_nh (and fib6_flags which it passes
through to rt6_score_route). Move fib6_check_expired up to the call
sites so find_match is only called for relevant entries. Remove the
match argument which is mostly a pass through and use the return
boolean to decide if match gets set in the call sites.

The end result is a helper that can be called per fib6_nh struct
which is needed once fib entries reference nexthop objects that
have more than one fib6_nh.
