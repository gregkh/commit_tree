arm64: arch_timer: mark functions as __always_inline

If CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER is enabled function
arch_counter_get_cntvct() is marked as notrace. However, function
__arch_counter_get_cntvct is marked as inline. If
CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING is set that will make the two functions
tracable which they shouldn't.

Rework so that functions __arch_counter_get_* are marked with
__always_inline so they will be inlined even if CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING
is turned on.
