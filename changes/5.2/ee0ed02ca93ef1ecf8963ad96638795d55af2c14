ext4: do not delete unlinked inode from orphan list on failed truncate

It is possible that unlinked inode enters ext4_setattr() (e.g. if
somebody calls ftruncate(2) on unlinked but still open file). In such
case we should not delete the inode from the orphan list if truncate
fails. Note that this is mostly a theoretical concern as filesystem is
corrupted if we reach this path anyway but let's be consistent in our
orphan handling.
