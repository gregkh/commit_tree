KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Introduce a new mutex for the XIVE device

The XICS-on-XIVE KVM device needs to allocate XIVE event queues when a
priority is used by the OS. This is referred as EQ provisioning and it
is done under the hood when :

  1. a CPU is hot-plugged in the VM
  2. the "set-xive" is called at VM startup
  3. sources are restored at VM restore

The kvm->lock mutex is used to protect the different XIVE structures
being modified but in some contexts, kvm->lock is taken under the
vcpu->mutex which is not permitted by the KVM locking rules.

Introduce a new mutex 'lock' for the KVM devices for them to
synchronize accesses to the XIVE device structures.
