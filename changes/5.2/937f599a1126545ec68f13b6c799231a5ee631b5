i40e: VF's promiscuous attribute is not kept

This patch fixes a bug where the promiscuous mode was not being
kept when the VF switched to a new VLAN.
Now we are config two times a promiscuous mode when we switch VLAN.
Without this change when we change VF VLAN we still receive
all the packets from previous VLAN and only unicast from new VLAN.
