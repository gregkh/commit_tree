tcp: add tcp_inet6_sk() helper

TCP ipv6 fast path dereferences a pointer to get to the inet6
part of a tcp socket, but given the fixed memory placement,
we can do better and avoid a possible cache line miss.

This also reduces register pressure, since we let the compiler
know about this memory placement.
