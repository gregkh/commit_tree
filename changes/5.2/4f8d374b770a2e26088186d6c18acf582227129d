hwmon: (max6650) add thermal cooling device capability

This allows max6650 devices to be referenced in dts as a cooling device.

The pwm value seems duplicated in cooling_dev_state but since pwm goes
through rounding logic into data->dac, it is modified and messes with
the thermal zone state algorithms. It's also better to serve a cache
value, thus avoiding periodic actual i2c traffic.
