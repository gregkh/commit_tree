cgroup: get rid of cgroup_freezer_frozen_exit()

A task should never enter the exit path with the task->frozen bit set.
Any frozen task must enter the signal handling loop and the only
way to escape is through cgroup_leave_frozen(true), which
unconditionally drops the task->frozen bit. So it means that
cgroyp_freezer_frozen_exit() has zero chances to be called and
has to be removed.

Let's put a WARN_ON_ONCE() instead of the cgroup_freezer_frozen_exit()
call to catch any potential leak of the task's frozen bit.
