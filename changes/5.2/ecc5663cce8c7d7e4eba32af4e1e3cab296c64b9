net: Change nhc_flags to unsigned char

nhc_flags holds the RTNH_F flags for a given nexthop (fib{6}_nh).
All of the RTNH_F_ flags fit in an unsigned char, and since the API to
userspace (rtnh_flags and lower byte of rtm_flags) is 1 byte it can not
grow. Make nhc_flags in fib_nh_common an unsigned char and shrink the
size of the struct by 8, from 56 to 48 bytes.

Update the flags arguments for up netdevice events and fib_nexthop_info
which determines the RTNH_F flags to return on a dump/event. The RTNH_F
flags are passed in the lower byte of rtm_flags which is an unsigned int
so use a temp variable for the flags to fib_nexthop_info and combine
with rtm_flags in the caller.
