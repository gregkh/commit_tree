bpf: relax inode permission check for retrieving bpf program

For iptable module to load a bpf program from a pinned location, it
only retrieve a loaded program and cannot change the program content so
requiring a write permission for it might not be necessary.
Also when adding or removing an unrelated iptable rule, it might need to
flush and reload the xt_bpf related rules as well and triggers the inode
permission check. It might be better to remove the write premission
check for the inode so we won't need to grant write access to all the
processes that flush and restore iptables rules.
