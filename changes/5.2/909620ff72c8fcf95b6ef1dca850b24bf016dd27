tipc: use standard write_lock & unlock functions when creating node

In the function tipc_node_create() we protect the peer capability field
by using the node rw_lock. However, we access the lock directly instead
of using the dedicated functions for this, as we do everywhere else in
node.c. This cosmetic spot is fixed here.
