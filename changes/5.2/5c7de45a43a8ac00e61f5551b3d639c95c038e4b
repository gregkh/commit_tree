media: vsp1: dl: Allow chained display lists for display pipelines

Refactor the display list header setup to allow chained display lists
with display pipelines. Chain the display lists as for mem-to-mem
pipelines, but enable the frame end interrupt for every list as display
pipelines have a single list per frame.

This feature will be used to disable writeback exactly one frame after
enabling it by chaining a writeback disable display list.
