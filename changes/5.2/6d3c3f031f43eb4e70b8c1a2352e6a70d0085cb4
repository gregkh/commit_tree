HID: logitech-dj: make appending of the HID++ descriptors conditional

Make the appending of the HID++ descriptors in logi_dj_ll_parse
conditional. This is a preparation patch for adding support for the
Logitech mini Bluetooth receiver in HID proxy mode (its default mode),
where some of the paired devices may not be Logitech devices and thus may
not be HID++ capable.

This uses a fake bit 63 in reports_supported, which is changed from an
u32 to an u64 for this. Bits <= 31 are not usable for this because that
would cause a behavioral change in logi_dj_recv_forward_null_report.
