slab: remove /proc/slab_allocators

It turned out that DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK is still broken even after recent
recue efforts that when there is a large number of objects like
kmemleak_object which is normal on a debug kernel,

  # grep kmemleak /proc/slabinfo
  kmemleak_object   2243606 3436210 ...

reading /proc/slab_allocators could easily loop forever while processing
the kmemleak_object cache and any additional freeing or allocating
objects will trigger a reprocessing. To make a situation worse,
soft-lockups could easily happen in this sitatuion which will call
printk() to allocate more kmemleak objects to guarantee an infinite
loop.

Also, since it seems no one had noticed when it was totally broken
more than 2-year ago - see the commit fcf88917dd43 ("slab: fix a crash
by reading /proc/slab_allocators"), probably nobody cares about it
anymore due to the decline of the SLAB. Just remove it entirely.
