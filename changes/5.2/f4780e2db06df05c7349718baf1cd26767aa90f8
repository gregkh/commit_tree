Move EM_HEXAGON to uapi/linux/elf-em.h

This should never have been defined in the arch tree to begin with,
and now uapi/linux/audit.h header is going to use EM_HEXAGON
in order to define AUDIT_ARCH_HEXAGON which is needed to implement
syscall_get_arch() which in turn is required to extend
the generic ptrace API with PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO request.
