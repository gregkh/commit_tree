NFC: Orphan the subsystem

Samuel clearly hasn't been working on this in many years and
patches getting to the wireless list are just being ignored
entirely now. Mark the subsystem as orphan to reflect the
current state and revert back to the netdev list so at least
some fixes can be picked up by Dave.
