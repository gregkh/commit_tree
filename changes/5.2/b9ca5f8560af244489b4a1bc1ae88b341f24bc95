tty: pty: Fix race condition between release_one_tty and pty_write

Especially when a linked tty is used such as pty, the linked tty
port's buf works have not been cancelled while master tty port's
buf work has been cancelled. Since release_one_tty and flush_to_ldisc
run in workqueue threads separately, when pty_cleanup happens and
link tty port is freed, flush_to_ldisc tries to access freed port
and port->itty, eventually it causes a panic.
This patch utilizes the magic value with holding the tty_mutex to
check if the tty->link is valid.
