block, bfq: do not tag totally seeky queues as soft rt

Sync random I/O is likely to be confused with soft real-time I/O,
because it is characterized by limited throughput and apparently
isochronous arrival pattern. To avoid false positives, this commits
prevents bfq_queues containing only random (seeky) I/O from being
tagged as soft real-time.
