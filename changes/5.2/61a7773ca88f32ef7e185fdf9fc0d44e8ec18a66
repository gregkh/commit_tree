perf report: Add stub processing of compressed events for -D

Committer note:

Split from a larger patch, this only dumps PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED as
unhandled, so that when we introduce the record part in the next patch,
we don't see unhandled events when using 'perf record -D'.

Changed it so that we dump the event if the handler is just a stub, i.e.
for the case where we don't have ZSTD linked but we're processing a
perf.data file generated by a tool with that linked.

Also when failing to decompress we can't just dump the uncompressed
event and return 0, we have to propagate the error.
