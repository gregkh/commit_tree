staging: greybus: power_supply: fix prop-descriptor request size

Since moving the message buffers off the stack, the dynamically
allocated get-prop-descriptor request buffer is incorrectly sized due to
using the pointer rather than request-struct size when creating the
operation.

Fortunately, the pointer size is always larger than this one-byte
request, but this could still cause trouble on the remote end due to the
unexpected message size.
