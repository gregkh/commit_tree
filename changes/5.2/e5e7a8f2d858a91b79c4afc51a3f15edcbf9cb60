selftests/bpf: add few verifier scale tests

Add 3 basic tests that stress verifier scalability.

test_verif_scale1.c calls non-inlined jhash() function 90 times on
different position in the packet.
This test simulates network packet parsing.
jhash function is ~140 instructions and main program is ~1200 insns.

test_verif_scale2.c force inlines jhash() function 90 times.
This program is ~15k instructions long.

test_verif_scale3.c calls non-inlined jhash() function 90 times on
But this time jhash has to process 32-bytes from the packet
instead of 14-bytes in tests 1 and 2.
jhash function is ~230 insns and main program is ~1200 insns.

$ test_progs -s
can be used to see verifier stats.
