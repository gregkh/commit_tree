bpftool: Improve handling of ENOSPC on reuseport_array map dumps

avoids outputting a series of
	value:
	No space left on device

The value itself is not wrong but bpf_fd_reuseport_array_lookup_elem() can
only return it if the map was created with value_size = 8. There's nothing
bpftool can do about it. Instead of repeating this error for every key in
the map, print an explanatory warning and a specialized error.

example before:
key: 00 00 00 00
value:
No space left on device
key: 01 00 00 00
value:
No space left on device
key: 02 00 00 00
value:
No space left on device
Found 0 elements

example after:
Warning: cannot read values from reuseport_sockarray map with value_size != 8
key: 00 00 00 00  value: <cannot read>
key: 01 00 00 00  value: <cannot read>
key: 02 00 00 00  value: <cannot read>
Found 0 elements
