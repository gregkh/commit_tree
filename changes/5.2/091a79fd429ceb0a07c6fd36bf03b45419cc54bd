mt76: mt76x02: remove bogus mutex usage

mac80211 .start(), .stop() callbacks are never called concurrently with
other callbacks. The only concurencly is with mt76 works which we cancel
on stop() and schedule on start().

This fixes possible deadlock on cancel_delayed_work_sync(&dev->mac_work)
as mac_work also take mutex.
