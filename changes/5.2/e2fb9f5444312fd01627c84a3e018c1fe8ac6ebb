powerpc/32: Prepare for Kernel Userspace Access Protection

This patch adds ASM macros for saving, restoring and checking
the KUAP state, and modifies setup_32 to call them on exceptions
from kernel.

The macros are defined as empty by default for when CONFIG_PPC_KUAP
is not selected and/or for platforms which don't handle (yet) KUAP.
