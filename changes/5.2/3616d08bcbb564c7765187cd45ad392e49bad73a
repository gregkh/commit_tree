ipv6: Move ipv6 stubs to a separate header file

The number of stubs is growing and has nothing to do with addrconf.
Move the definition of the stubs to a separate header file and update
users. In the move, drop the vxlan specific comment before ipv6_stub.

Code move only; no functional change intended.
