fbdev: sm712fb: fix boot screen glitch when sm712fb replaces VGA

When the machine is booted in VGA mode, loading sm712fb would cause
a glitch of random pixels shown on the screen. To prevent it from
happening, we first clear the entire framebuffer, and we also need
to stop calling smtcfb_setmode() during initialization, the fbdev
layer will call it for us later when it's ready.
