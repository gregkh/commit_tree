powerpc/32s: Prepare Kernel Userspace Access Protection

This patch prepares Kernel Userspace Access Protection for
book3s/32.

Due to limitations of the processor page protection capabilities,
the protection is only against writing. read protection cannot be
achieved using page protection.

book3s/32 provides the following values for PP bits:

PP00 provides RW for Key 0 and NA for Key 1
PP01 provides RW for Key 0 and RO for Key 1
PP10 provides RW for all
PP11 provides RO for all

Today PP10 is used for RW pages and PP11 for RO pages, and user
segment register's Kp and Ks are set to 1. This patch modifies
page protection to use PP01 for RW pages and sets user segment
registers to Kp 0 and Ks 0.

This will allow to setup Userspace write access protection by
settng Ks to 1 in the following patch.

Kernel space segment registers remain unchanged.
