dmaengine: dw-axi-dmac: fix null dereference when pointer first is null

In the unlikely event that axi_desc_get returns a null desc in the
very first iteration of the while-loop the error exit path ends
up calling axi_desc_put on a null pointer 'first' and this causes
a null pointer dereference.  Fix this by adding a null check on
pointer 'first' before calling axi_desc_put.
