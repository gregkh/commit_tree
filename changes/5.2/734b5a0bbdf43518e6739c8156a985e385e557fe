ALSA: Replace snd_malloc_pages() and snd_free_pages() with standard helpers, take#2

snd_malloc_pages() and snd_free_pages() are merely thin wrappers of
the standard page allocator / free functions.  Even the arguments are
compatible with some standard helpers, so there is little merit of
keeping these wrappers.

This patch replaces the all existing callers of snd_malloc_pages() and
snd_free_pages() with the direct calls of the standard helper
functions.  In this version, we use a recently introduced one,
alloc_pages_exact(), which suits better than the old
snd_malloc_pages() implementation for our purposes.  Then we can avoid
the waste of pages by alignment to power-of-two.

Since alloc_pages_exact() does split pages, we need no longer
__GFP_COMP flag; or better to say, we must not pass __GFP_COMP to
alloc_pages_exact().  So the former unconditional addition of
__GFP_COMP flag in snd_malloc_pages() is dropped, as well as in most
other places.
