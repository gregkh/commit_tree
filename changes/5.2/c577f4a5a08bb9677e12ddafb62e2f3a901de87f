PCI: rockchip: Fix rockchip_pcie_ep_assert_intx() bitwise operations

Currently the bitwise operations on the u16 variable 'status' with
the setting ROCKCHIP_PCIE_EP_CMD_STATUS_IS are incorrect because
ROCKCHIP_PCIE_EP_CMD_STATUS_IS is 1UL<<19 which is wider than the
u16 variable.

Fix this by making status a u32.
