perf session: Define 'bytes_transferred' and 'bytes_compressed' metrics

Define 'bytes_transferred' and 'bytes_compressed' metrics to calculate
ratio in the end of the data collection:

	compression ratio = bytes_transferred / bytes_compressed

The 'bytes_transferred' metric accumulates the amount of bytes that was
extracted from the mmaped kernel buffers for compression, while
'bytes_compressed' accumulates the amount of bytes that was received
after applying compression.
