cfg80211: Add support to set tx power for a station associated

This patch adds support to set transmit power setting type and transmit
power level attributes to NL80211_CMD_SET_STATION in order to facilitate
adjusting the transmit power level of a station associated to the AP.

The added attributes allow selection of automatic and limited transmit
power level, with the level defined in dBm format.
