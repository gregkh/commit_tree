rcutorture: Fix expected forward progress duration in OOM notifier

The rcutorture_oom_notify() function has a misplaced close parenthesis
that results in increasingly long delays in rcu_fwd_progress_check()'s
checking for various RCU forward-progress problems.  This commit therefore
puts the parenthesis in the right place.
