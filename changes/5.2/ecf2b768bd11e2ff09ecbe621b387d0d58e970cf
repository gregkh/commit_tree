Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix crash with non-serdev devices

qca_set_baudrate() calls serdev_device_wait_until_sent() assuming that
the HCI is always associated with a serdev device. This isn't true for
ROME controllers instantiated through ldisc, where the call causes a
crash due to a NULL pointer dereferentiation. Only call the function
when we have a serdev device. The timeout for ROME devices at the end
of qca_set_baudrate() is long enough to be reasonably sure that the
command was sent.
