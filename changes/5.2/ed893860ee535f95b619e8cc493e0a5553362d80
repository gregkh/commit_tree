drm/arm/malidp:- Added support for new YUV formats for DP500, DP550 and DP650

We have added support for some AFBC only pixel formats like :-
DRM_FORMAT_YUV420_8BIT (single plane YUV 420 8 bit format)
DRM_FORMAT_VUY888 (single plane YUV 444 8 bit format)
DRM_FORMAT_VUY101010 (single plane YUV 444 10 bit format)
DRM_FORMAT_YUV420_10BIT (single plane YUV 420 10 bit format)

Generally, these formats are supported by our hardware using the same
hw-ids as the equivalent multi plane pixel formats.

Also we have added support for XYUV 444 8 and 10 bit formats

Changes since v3 (series):
- Added the ack
- Rebased on the latest drm-misc-next
