block: bio: ensure newly added bio flags don't override BVEC_POOL_IDX

With the introduction of BIO_NO_PAGE_REF we've used up all available bits
in bio::bi_flags.

Convert the defines of the flags to an enum and add a BUILD_BUG_ON() call
to make sure no-one adds a new one and thus overrides the BVEC_POOL_IDX
causing crashes.
