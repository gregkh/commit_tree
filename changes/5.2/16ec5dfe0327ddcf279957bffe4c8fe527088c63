ASoC: Intel: kbl_da7219_max98357a: Map BTN_0 to KEY_PLAYPAUSE

On kbl_rt5663_max98927, commit 38a5882e4292
    ("ASoC: Intel: kbl_rt5663_max98927: Map BTN_0 to KEY_PLAYPAUSE")
    This key pair mapping to play/pause when playing Youtube

The Android 3.5mm Headset jack specification mentions that BTN_0 should
be mapped to KEY_MEDIA, but this is less logical than KEY_PLAYPAUSE,
which has much broader userspace support.

For example, the Chrome OS userspace now supports KEY_PLAYPAUSE to toggle
play/pause of videos and audio, but does not handle KEY_MEDIA.

Furthermore, Android itself now supports KEY_PLAYPAUSE equivalently, as the
new USB headset spec requires KEY_PLAYPAUSE for BTN_0.

The same fix is required on Chrome kbl_da7219_max98357a.
