media: change au0828 to use Media Device Allocator API

Media Device Allocator API to allows multiple drivers share a media device.
This API solves a very common use-case for media devices where one physical
device (an USB stick) provides both audio and video. When such media device
exposes a standard USB Audio class, a proprietary Video class, two or more
independent drivers will share a single physical USB bridge. In such cases,
it is necessary to coordinate access to the shared resource.

Using this API, drivers can allocate a media device with the shared struct
device as the key. Once the media device is allocated by a driver, other
drivers can get a reference to it. The media device is released when all
the references are released.

Change au0828 to use Media Device Allocator API to allocate media device
with the parent usb struct device as the key, so it can be shared with the
snd_usb_audio driver.
