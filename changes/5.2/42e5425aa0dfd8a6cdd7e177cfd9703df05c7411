tipc: introduce new socket option TIPC_SOCK_RECVQ_USED

When using TIPC_SOCK_RECVQ_DEPTH for getsockopt(), it returns the
number of buffers in receive socket buffer which is not so helpful
for user space applications.

This commit introduces the new option TIPC_SOCK_RECVQ_USED which
returns the current allocated bytes of the receive socket buffer.
This helps user space applications dimension its buffer usage to
avoid buffer overload issue.
