can: flexcan: fix timeout when set small bitrate

Current we can meet timeout issue when setting a small bitrate like
10000 as follows on i.MX6UL EVK board (ipg clock = 66MHZ, per clock =
30MHZ):

| root@imx6ul7d:~# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 10000

It is caused by calling of flexcan_chip_unfreeze() timeout.

Originally the code is using usleep_range(10, 20) for unfreeze
operation, but the patch (8badd65 can: flexcan: avoid calling
usleep_range from interrupt context) changed it into udelay(10) which is
only a half delay of before, there're also some other delay changes.

After double to FLEXCAN_TIMEOUT_US to 100 can fix the issue.

Meanwhile, Rasmus Villemoes reported that even with a timeout of 100,
flexcan_probe() fails on the MPC8309, which requires a value of at least
140 to work reliably. 250 works for everyone.
