s390/qdio: simplify SBAL range calculation

When passing a range of ready-to-process SBALs to the upper-layer
driver, use the available 'count' instead of calculating the distance
between the first_to_check and first_to_kick cursors.

This simplifies the logic of the queue-scan path, and opens up the
possibility of scanning all 128 SBALs in one go (as determining the
reported count no longer requires wrap-around safe arithmetic on the
queue's cursors).
