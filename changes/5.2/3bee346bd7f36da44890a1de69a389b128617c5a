USB: hub: Remove returned value 'status' since never used

The returned value in status has never been used since
commit 4296c70a5ec3 ("USB/xHCI: Enable USB 3.0 hub remote wakeup.")
So remove 'status' completely.

Remove warning (W=1):

  drivers/usb/core/hub.c:3671:8: warning: variable 'status' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
