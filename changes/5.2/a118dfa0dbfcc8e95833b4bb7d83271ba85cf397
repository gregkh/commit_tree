crypto: caam/jr - Remove spinlock for output job ring

For each job ring pair, the output ring is processed exactly by one cpu
at a time under a tasklet context (one per ring). Therefore, there is no
need to protect a job ring's access & its private data structure using a
lock. Hence the lock can be removed.
