irqdesc: Replace irq_kobj_type's default_attrs field with groups

The kobj_type default_attrs field is being replaced by the
default_groups field. Replace irq_kobj_type's default_attrs field with
default_groups and use the ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS macro to create irq_groups.

This patch was tested by verifying that the sysfs files for the
attributes in the default groups were created.
