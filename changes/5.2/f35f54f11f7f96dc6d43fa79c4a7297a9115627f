virtio/s390: DMA support for virtio-ccw

Currently virtio-ccw devices do not work if the device has
VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM. In future we do want to support DMA API with
virtio-ccw.

Let us do the plumbing, so the feature VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM works
with virtio-ccw.

Let us also switch from legacy avail/used accessors to the DMA aware
ones (even if it isn't strictly necessary), and remove the legacy
accessors (we were the last users).
