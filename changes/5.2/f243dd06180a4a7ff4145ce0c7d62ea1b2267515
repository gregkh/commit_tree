drm/nouveau: Use drm_fb_helper_fill_info

This changes the fb name from "nouveaufb" to "nouveaudrmfb".

Aside: I wonder whether the in_interrupt() check is good enough for
the nouveau acceleration. Cargo-cult says drm_can_sleep() is needed,
which isn't actually working if you pick a .config without PREEMPT.
For the generic fbdev defio support we've gone with offloading
everything to a worker. For the non-accel callbacks (set_par, blank
and friends) checking for oops_in_progress is good enough to catch all
the evil calling contexts.

v2: Rebase
