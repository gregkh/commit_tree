net: hns3: fix set port based VLAN issue for VF

In original codes, ndo_set_vf_vlan() in hns3 driver was implemented
wrong. It adds or removes VLAN into VLAN filter for VF, but VF is
unaware of it.

This patch fixes it. When VF loads up, it firstly queries the port
based VLAN state from PF. When user change port based VLAN state
from PF, PF firstly checks whether the VF is alive. If the VF is
alive, then PF notifies the VF the modification; otherwise PF
configure the port based VLAN state directly.
