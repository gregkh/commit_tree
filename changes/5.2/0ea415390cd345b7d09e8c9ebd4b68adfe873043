clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Use arch_timer_read_counter to access stable counters

Instead of always going via arch_counter_get_cntvct_stable to access the
counter workaround, let's have arch_timer_read_counter point to the
right method.

For that, we need to track whether any CPU in the system has a
workaround for the counter. This is done by having an atomic variable
tracking this.
