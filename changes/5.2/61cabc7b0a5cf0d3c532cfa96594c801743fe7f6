cifs: fix GlobalMid_Lock bug in cifs_reconnect

We can not hold the GlobalMid_Lock spinlock during the
dfs processing in cifs_reconnect since it invokes things that may sleep
and thus trigger :

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rwsem.c:23

Thus we need to drop the spinlock during this code block.
