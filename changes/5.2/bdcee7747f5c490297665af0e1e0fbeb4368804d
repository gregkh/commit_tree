EDAC/amd64: Support more than two Unified Memory Controllers

The first few models of Family 17h all had 2 Unified Memory Controllers
per Die, so this was treated as a fixed value. However, future systems
may have more Unified Memory Controllers per Die.

Related to this, the channel number and base address of a Unified Memory
Controller were found by matching on fixed, known values. However,
current and future systems follow this pattern for the channel number
and base address of a Unified Memory Controller: 0xYXXXXX, where Y is
the channel number. So matching on hardcoded values is not necessary.

Set the number of Unified Memory Controllers at driver init time based
on the family/model. Also, update the functions that find the channel
number and base address of a Unified Memory Controller to support more
than two.
