net: stmmac: update rx tail pointer register to fix rx dma hang issue.

Currently we will not update the receive descriptor tail pointer in
stmmac_rx_refill. Rx dma will think no available descriptors and stop
once received packets exceed DMA_RX_SIZE, so that the rx only test will fail.

Update the receive tail pointer in stmmac_rx_refill to add more descriptors
to the rx channel, so packets can be received continually
