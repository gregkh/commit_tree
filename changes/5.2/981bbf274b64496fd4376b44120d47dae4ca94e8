csky: Fixup wrong update_mmu_cache implementation

In our stress test, we found some crash problem caused by:

if (!(vma->vm_flags & VM_EXEC))
	return;

in update_mmu_cache().

Seems current update_mmu_cache implementation is wrong and we retread
to the conservative implementation.

Also the usage of kmap_atomic in update_mmu_cache is risky, page-virtual
may be scheduled out and changed, so we must use preempt_disable &
pagefault_disable which is called by kmap_atomic().
