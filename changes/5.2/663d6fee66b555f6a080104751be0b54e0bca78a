nvme-loop: kill timeout handler

Firstly it doesn't make sense to handle timeout for loop: 1) for admin
queue, the request is always completed in code path of queuing IO. 2)
for normal IO request, the timeout on these IOs have been handled by
underlying queue already.

Secondly nvme-loop's timeout handler is simply broken, and easy to
cause issue: 1) no any sync/protection between timeout and normal
completion, and now it is driver's responsibility to deal with
that; 2) bad reset implementation, blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues()
is called after all NSs's queue is stopped(quiesced), and easy
to trigger deadlock.

So kill the timeout handler.
