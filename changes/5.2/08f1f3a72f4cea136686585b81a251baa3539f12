x86/io: Remove useless definition of mmiowb()

x86 maps mmiowb() to barrier(), but this is superfluous because a
compiler barrier is already implied by spin_unlock(). Since x86 also
includes asm-generic/io.h in its asm/io.h file, remove the definition
entirely and pick up the dummy definition from core code.
