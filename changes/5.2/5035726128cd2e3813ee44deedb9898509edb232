Bluetooth: btbcm: Add default address for BCM43341B

The BCM43341B has the default MAC address 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC if none
is given. This address was found when enabling Bluetooth on multiple
Intel Edison modules. It also contains the sequence 43341B, the name
the chip identifies itself as. Using the same BD_ADDR is problematic
when having multiple Intel Edison modules in each others range.
The default address also has the LAA (locally administered address)
bit set which prevents a BNEP device from being created, needed for
BT tethering.

Add this to the list of black listed default MAC addresses and let
the user configure a valid one using f.i.
`btmgmt -i hci0 public-addr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`
