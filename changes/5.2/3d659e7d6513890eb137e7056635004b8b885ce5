arm64: perf_event: Remove wrongfully used inline

The functions armv8pmu_read_counter() and armv8pmu_write_counter()
are `static inline` while they are only referenced when assigned
to a function pointer field in a `struct arm_pmu` instance.

The inline keyword is thus counter intuitive and shouldn't be used.
