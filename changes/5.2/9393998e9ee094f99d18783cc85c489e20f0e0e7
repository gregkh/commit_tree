tools/memory-model: Dynamically check SRCU lock-to-unlock matching

This commit checks that the return value of srcu_read_lock() is passed
to the matching srcu_read_unlock(), where "matching" is determined by
nesting.  This check operates as follows:

   1. srcu_read_lock() creates an integer token, which is stored into
      the generated events.
   2. srcu_read_unlock() records its second (token) argument into the
      generated event.
   3. A new herd primitive 'different-values' filters out pairs of events
      with identical values from the relation passed as its argument.
   4. The bell file applies the above primitive to the (srcu)
      read-side-critical-section relation 'srcu-rscs' and flags non-empty
      results.

BEWARE: Works only with herd version 7.51+6 and onwards.
