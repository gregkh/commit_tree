drm/i915: Fix I915_EXEC_RING_MASK

This was supposed to be a mask of all known rings, but it is being used
by execbuffer to filter out invalid rings, and so is instead mapping high
unused values onto valid rings. Instead of a mask of all known rings,
we need it to be the mask of all possible rings.

Fixes: de1add360522 ("drm/i915: Decouple execbuf uAPI from internal implementation")
