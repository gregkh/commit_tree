media: vb2: add requires_requests bit for stateless codecs

Stateless codecs require the use of the Request API as opposed of it
being optional.

So add a bit to indicate this and let vb2 check for this.

If an attempt is made to queue a buffer without an associated request,
then the EBADR error is returned to userspace.

Doing this check in the vb2 core simplifies drivers, since they
don't have to check for this, they can just set this flag.
