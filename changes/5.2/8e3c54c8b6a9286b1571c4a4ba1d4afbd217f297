KVM: arm64: Enumerate SVE register indices for KVM_GET_REG_LIST

This patch includes the SVE register IDs in the list returned by
KVM_GET_REG_LIST, as appropriate.

On a non-SVE-enabled vcpu, no new IDs are added.

On an SVE-enabled vcpu, IDs for the FPSIMD V-registers are removed
from the list, since userspace is required to access the Z-
registers instead in order to access the V-register content.  For
the variably-sized SVE registers, the appropriate set of slice IDs
are enumerated, depending on the maximum vector length for the
vcpu.

As it currently stands, the SVE architecture never requires more
than one slice to exist per register, so this patch adds no
explicit support for enumerating multiple slices.  The code can be
extended straightforwardly to support this in the future, if
needed.
