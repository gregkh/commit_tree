RDMA/mlx5: Check for error return in flow_rule rather than err

Currently when the call to create_flow_rule_vport_sq fails, the error
check is being performed on err rather than on the return pointer
flow_rule.  The return flow_rule maybe NULL (which is not considered an
error) or an error code, so check for the error on flow_rule.
