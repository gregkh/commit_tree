net: dsa: tag_8021q: Change order of rx_vid setup

The 802.1Q tagging performs an unbalanced setup in terms of RX VIDs on
the CPU port. For the ingress path of a 802.1Q switch to work, the RX
VID of a port needs to be seen as tagged egress on the CPU port.

While configuring the other front-panel ports to be part of this VID,
for bridge scenarios, the untagged flag is applied even on the CPU port
in dsa_switch_vlan_add.  This happens because DSA applies the same flags
on the CPU port as on the (bridge-controlled) slave ports, and the
effect in this case is that the CPU port tagged settings get deleted.

Instead of fixing DSA by introducing a way to control VLAN flags on the
CPU port (and hence stop inheriting from the slave ports) - a hard,
perhaps intractable problem - avoid this situation by moving the setup
part of the RX VID on the CPU port after all the other front-panel ports
have been added to the VID.
