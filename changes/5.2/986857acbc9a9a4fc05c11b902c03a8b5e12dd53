watchdog: imx_sc: Add i.MX system controller watchdog support

i.MX8QXP is an ARMv8 SoC which has a Cortex-M4 system controller
inside, the system controller is in charge of controlling power,
clock and watchdog etc..

This patch adds i.MX system controller watchdog driver support,
watchdog operation needs to be done in secure EL3 mode via
ARM-Trusted-Firmware, using SMC call, CPU will trap into
ARM-Trusted-Firmware and then it will request system controller
to do watchdog operation via IPC.
