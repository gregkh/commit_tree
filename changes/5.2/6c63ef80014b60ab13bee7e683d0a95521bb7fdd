parisc: Remove lock code to serialize TLB operations in pacache.S

TLB operations only need to be serialized on machines with the Merced
(Stretch) bus. The only machines in this category are L and N class, and
they require a 64-bit PA 2.0 kernel. On these machines, we use local TLB
purges in the tmpalias routines.
We don't need to serialize TLB purges on all other machines. Thus, the
lock/unlock code can be removed when CONFIG_PA20 is not defined.
Further, when CONFIG_PA20 is not defined, alternative patching converts
the TLB purges to local purges when PA 2.0 hardware has been detected.
