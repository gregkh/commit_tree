kdb: Get rid of broken attempt to print CCVERSION in kdb summary

If you drop into kdb and type "summary", it prints out a line that
says this:

  ccversion  CCVERSION

...and I don't mean that it actually prints out the version of the C
compiler.  It literally prints out the string "CCVERSION".

The version of the C Compiler is already printed at boot up and it
doesn't seem useful to replicate this in kdb.  Let's just delete it.
We can also delete the bit of the Makefile that called the C compiler
in an attempt to pass this into kdb.  This will remove one extra call
to the C compiler at Makefile parse time and (very slightly) speed up
builds.
