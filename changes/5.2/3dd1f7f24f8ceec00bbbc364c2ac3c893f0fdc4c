tracing: probeevent: Fix to make the type of $comm string

Fix to make the type of $comm "string".  If we set the other type to $comm
argument, it shows meaningless value or wrong data. Currently probe events
allow us to set string array type (e.g. ":string[2]"), or other digit types
like x8 on $comm. But since clearly $comm is just a string data, it should
not be fetched by other types including array.
