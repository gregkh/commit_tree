x86/PCI: Fix PCI IRQ routing table memory leak

In pcibios_irq_init(), the PCI IRQ routing table 'pirq_table' is first
found through pirq_find_routing_table().  If the table is not found and
CONFIG_PCI_BIOS is defined, the table is then allocated in
pcibios_get_irq_routing_table() using kmalloc().  Later, if the I/O APIC is
used, this table is actually not used.  In that case, the allocated table
is not freed, which is a memory leak.

Free the allocated table if it is not used.

[bhelgaas: added Ingo's reviewed-by, since the only change since v1 was to
use the irq_routing_table local variable name he suggested]
