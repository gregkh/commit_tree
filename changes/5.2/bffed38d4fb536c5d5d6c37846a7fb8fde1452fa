kvm: selftests: aarch64: dirty_log_test: fix unaligned memslot size

The memory slot size must be aligned to the host's page size. When
testing a guest with a 4k page size on a host with a 64k page size,
then 3 guest pages are not host page size aligned. Since we just need
a nearly arbitrary number of extra pages to ensure the memslot is not
aligned to a 64 host-page boundary for this test, then we can use
16, as that's 64k aligned, but not 64 * 64k aligned.
