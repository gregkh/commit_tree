ipv4: Refactor nexthop attributes in fib_dump_info

Similar to ipv6, move addition of nexthop attributes to dump
message into helpers that are called for both single path and
multipath routes. Align the new helpers to the IPv6 variant
which most notably means computing the flags argument based on
settings in nh_flags.

The RTA_FLOW argument is unique to IPv4, so it is appended after
the new fib_nexthop_info helper. The intent of a later patch is to
make both fib_nexthop_info and fib_add_nexthop usable for both IPv4
and IPv6. This patch is stepping stone in that direction.
