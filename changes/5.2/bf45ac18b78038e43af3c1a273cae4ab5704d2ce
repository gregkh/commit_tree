thermal: cpu_cooling: Actually trace CPU load in thermal_power_cpu_get_power

The CPU load values passed to the thermal_power_cpu_get_power
tracepoint are zero for all CPUs, unless, unless the
thermal_power_cpu_limit tracepoint is enabled too:

  irq/41-rockchip-98    [000] ....   290.972410: thermal_power_cpu_get_power:
  cpus=0000000f freq=1800000 load={{0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0}} dynamic_power=4815

vs

  irq/41-rockchip-96    [000] ....    95.773585: thermal_power_cpu_get_power:
  cpus=0000000f freq=1800000 load={{0x56,0x64,0x64,0x5e}} dynamic_power=4959
  irq/41-rockchip-96    [000] ....    95.773596: thermal_power_cpu_limit:
  cpus=0000000f freq=408000 cdev_state=10 power=416

There seems to be no good reason for omitting the CPU load information
depending on another tracepoint. My guess is that the intention was to
check whether thermal_power_cpu_get_power is (still) enabled, however
'load_cpu != NULL' already indicates that it was at least enabled when
cpufreq_get_requested_power() was entered, there seems little gain
from omitting the assignment if the tracepoint was just disabled, so
just remove the check.
