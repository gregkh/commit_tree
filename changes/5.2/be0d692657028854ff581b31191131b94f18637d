net-sysfs: Replace ktype default_attrs field with groups

The kobj_type default_attrs field is being replaced by the
default_groups field. Replace the default_attrs fields in rx_queue_ktype
and netdev_queue_ktype with default_groups. Use the ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS
macro to create rx_queue_default_groups and netdev_queue_default_groups.

This patch was tested by verifying that the sysfs files for the
attributes in the default groups were created.
