net: aquantia: enable driver build for arm64 or compile_test

The driver is now constantly tested in our lab on aarch64 hardware:
Jetson tx2, Pascal and Xavier tegra based hardware.
Many of tegra smmu related HW bugs were fixed or workarounded already.

Thus, add ARM64 into Kconfig.

Add also COMPILE_TEST dependency.
