PM / devfreq: Fix static checker warning in try_then_request_governor

The patch 23c7b54ca1cd: "PM / devfreq: Fix devfreq_add_device() when
drivers are built as modules." leads to the following static checker
warning:

    drivers/devfreq/devfreq.c:1043 governor_store()
    warn: 'governor' can also be NULL

The reason is that the try_then_request_governor() function returns both
error pointers and NULL. It should just return error pointers, so fix
this by returning a ERR_PTR to the error intead of returning NULL.
