io_uring: fix race condition reading SQE data

When punting to workers the SQE gets copied after the initial try.
There is a race condition between reading SQE data for the initial try
and copying it for punting it to the workers.

For example io_rw_done calls kiocb->ki_complete even if it was prepared
for IORING_OP_FSYNC (and would be NULL).

The easiest solution for now is to alway prepare again in the worker.

req->file is safe to prepare though as long as it is checked before use.
