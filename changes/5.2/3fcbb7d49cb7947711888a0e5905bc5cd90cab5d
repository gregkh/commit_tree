staging: kpc2000: Use memset to initialize resources

Clang warns:

drivers/staging/kpc2000/kpc2000/cell_probe.c:96:38: warning: suggest
braces around initialization of subobject [-Wmissing-braces]
    struct resource  resources[2] = {0};
                                     ^
                                     {}

One way to fix these warnings is to add additional braces like Clang
suggests; however, there has been a bit of push back from some
maintainers, who just prefer memset as it is unambiguous, doesn't
depend on a particular compiler version, and properly initializes all
subobjects [1][2]. Do that here so there are no more warnings.
