intel_th: msu: Switch over to scatterlist

Instead of using a home-grown array of pointers to the DMA pages, switch
over to scatterlist data types and accessors, which has all the convenient
accessors, can be used to batch-map DMA memory and is convenient for
passing around between different layers, which will be useful when MSU
buffer management has to cross the boundaries of the MSU driver.
