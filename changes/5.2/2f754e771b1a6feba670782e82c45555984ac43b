tracing: Have the error logs show up in the proper instances

As each instance has their own error_log file, it makes more sense that the
instances show the errors of their own instead of all error_logs having the
same data. Make it that the errors show up in the instance error_log file
that the error happens in. If no instance trace_array is available, then
NULL can be passed in which will create the error in the top level instance
(the one at the top of the tracefs directory).
