ovl: make i_ino consistent with st_ino in more cases

Relax the condition that overlayfs supports nfs export, to require
that i_ino is consistent with st_ino/d_ino.

It is enough to require that st_ino and d_ino are consistent.

This fixes the failure of xfstest generic/504, due to mismatch of
st_ino to inode number in the output of /proc/locks.
