x86/mce: Handle varying MCA bank counts

Linux reads MCG_CAP[Count] to find the number of MCA banks visible to a
CPU. Currently, this number is the same for all CPUs and a warning is
shown if there is a difference. The number of banks is overwritten with
the MCG_CAP[Count] value of each following CPU that boots.

According to the Intel SDM and AMD APM, the MCG_CAP[Count] value gives
the number of banks that are available to a "processor implementation".
The AMD BKDGs/PPRs further clarify that this value is per core. This
value has historically been the same for every core in the system, but
that is not an architectural requirement.

Future AMD systems may have different MCG_CAP[Count] values per core,
so the assumption that all CPUs will have the same MCG_CAP[Count] value
will no longer be valid.

Also, the first CPU to boot will allocate the struct mce_banks[] array
using the number of banks based on its MCG_CAP[Count] value. The machine
check handler and other functions use the global number of banks to
iterate and index into the mce_banks[] array. So it's possible to use an
out-of-bounds index on an asymmetric system where a following CPU sees a
MCG_CAP[Count] value greater than its predecessors.

Thus, allocate the mce_banks[] array to the maximum number of banks.
This will avoid the potential out-of-bounds index since the value of
mca_cfg.banks is capped to MAX_NR_BANKS.

Set the value of mca_cfg.banks equal to the max of the previous value
and the value for the current CPU. This way mca_cfg.banks will always
represent the max number of banks detected on any CPU in the system.

This will ensure that all CPUs will access all the banks that are
visible to them. A CPU that can access fewer than the max number of
banks will find the registers of the extra banks to be read-as-zero.

Furthermore, print the resulting number of MCA banks in use. Do this in
mcheck_late_init() so that the final value is printed after all CPUs
have been initialized.

Finally, get bank count from target CPU when doing injection with mce-inject
module.
