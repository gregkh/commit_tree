perf trace beauty renameat: No need to include linux/fs.h

There is no use for what is in that file, as everything is
built by the tools/perf/trace/beauty/rename_flags.sh script from
the copied kernel headers, the end result being:

  $ cat /tmp/build/perf/trace/beauty/generated/rename_flags_array.c
  static const char *rename_flags[] = {
	[0 + 1] = "NOREPLACE",
	[1 + 1] = "EXCHANGE",
	[2 + 1] = "WHITEOUT",
  };
  $

I.e. no use of any defines from uapi/linux/fs.h
