ARM: dts: imx6q-logicpd: Enable Analog audio capture

The original submission had functional audio out and was based
on reviewing other boards using the same wm8962 codec. However,
the Logic PD board uses an analog microphone which was being
disabled for a digital mic.  This patch corrects that and
explicitly sets the gpio-cfg pins all to 0x0000 which allows the
analog microphone to capture audio.
