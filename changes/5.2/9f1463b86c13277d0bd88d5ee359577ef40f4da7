irqchip/ti-sci-inta: Add support for Interrupt Aggregator driver

Texas Instruments' K3 generation SoCs has an IP Interrupt Aggregator
which is an interrupt controller that does the following:
- Converts events to interrupts that can be understood by
  an interrupt router.
- Allows for multiplexing of events to interrupts.

Configuration of the interrupt aggregator registers can only be done by
a system co-processor and the driver needs to send a message to this
co processor over TISCI protocol. Add the required infrastructure to
allow the allocation and routing of these events.
