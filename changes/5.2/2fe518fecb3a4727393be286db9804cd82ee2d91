nvmem: core: fix read buffer in place

When the bit_offset in the cell is zero, the pointer to the msb will
not be properly initialized (ie, will still be pointing to the first
byte in the buffer).

This being the case, if there are bits to clear in the msb, those will
be left untouched while the mask will incorrectly clear bit positions
on the first byte.

This commit also makes sure that any byte unused in the cell is
cleared.
