powerpc/32: implement fast entry for syscalls on non BOOKE

This patch implements a fast entry for syscalls.

Syscalls don't have to preserve non volatile registers except LR.

This patch then implement a fast entry for syscalls, where
volatile registers get clobbered.

As this entry is dedicated to syscall it always sets MSR_EE
and warns in case MSR_EE was previously off

It also assumes that the call is always from user, system calls are
unexpected from kernel.

The overall series improves null_syscall selftest by 12,5% on an 83xx
and by 17% on a 8xx.
