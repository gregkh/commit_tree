afs: Pass pre-fetch server and volume break counts into afs_iget5_set()

Pass the server and volume break counts from before the status fetch
operation that queried the attributes of a file into afs_iget5_set() so
that the new vnode's break counters can be initialised appropriately.

This allows detection of a volume or server break that happened whilst we
were fetching the status or setting up the vnode.
