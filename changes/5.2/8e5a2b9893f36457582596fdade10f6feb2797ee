percpu: update free path with correct new free region

When updating the chunk's contig_hint on the free path of a hint that
does not touch the page boundaries, it was incorrectly using the
starting offset of the free region and the block's contig_hint. This
could lead to incorrect assumptions about fit given a size and better
alignment of the start. Fix this by using (end - start) as this is only
called when updating a hint within a block.
