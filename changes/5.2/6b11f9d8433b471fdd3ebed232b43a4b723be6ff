udlfb: fix sleeping inside spinlock

If a framebuffer device is used as a console, the rendering calls
(copyarea, fillrect, imageblit) may be done with the console spinlock
held. On udlfb, these function call dlfb_handle_damage that takes a
blocking semaphore before acquiring an URB.

In order to fix the bug, this patch changes the calls copyarea, fillrect
and imageblit to offload USB work to a workqueue.

A side effect of this patch is 3x improvement in console scrolling speed
because the device doesn't have to be updated after each copyarea call.
