livepatch: Replace klp_ktype_patch's default_attrs with groups

The kobj_type default_attrs field is being replaced by the
default_groups field. Replace klp_ktype_patch's default_attrs field
with default_groups and use the ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS macro to create
klp_patch_groups.

This patch was tested by loading the livepatch-sample module and
verifying that the sysfs files for the attributes in the default groups
were created.
