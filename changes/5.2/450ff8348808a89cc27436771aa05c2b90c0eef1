btrfs: sysfs: Fix error path kobject memory leak

If a call to kobject_init_and_add() fails we must call kobject_put()
otherwise we leak memory.

Calling kobject_put() when kobject_init_and_add() fails drops the
refcount back to 0 and calls the ktype release method (which in turn
calls the percpu destroy and kfree).

Add call to kobject_put() in the error path of call to
kobject_init_and_add().
