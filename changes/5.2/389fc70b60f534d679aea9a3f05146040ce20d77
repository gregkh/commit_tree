iio: temperature: mlx90632 Relax the compatibility check

Register EE_VERSION contains mixture of calibration information and DSP
version. So far, because calibrations were definite, the driver
compatibility depended on whole contents, but in the newer production
process the calibration part changes. Because of that, value in EE_VERSION
will be changed and to avoid that calibration value is same as DSP version
the MSB in calibration part was fixed to 1.
That means existing calibrations (medical and consumer) will now have
hex values (bits 8 to 15) of 83 and 84 respectively. Driver compatibility
should be based only on DSP version part of the EE_VERSION (bits 0 to 7)
register.
