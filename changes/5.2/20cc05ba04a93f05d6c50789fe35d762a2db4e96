clk: renesas: rcar-gen3: Parameterise Z and Z2 clock fixed divisor

Parameterise Z and Z2 clock fixed divisor to allow clocks with a fixed
divisor other than 2, the value used by all such clocks supported to date.

This is in preparation for supporting the Z2 clock on the R-Car E3
(r8a77990) SoC which has a fixed divisor of 4.
