HID: logitech-dj: Fix 064d:c52f receiver support

The c52f nano receiver is a mouse only receiver. This means that it needs
some special handling compared to the c534 nano receiver:

1) It sends unnumbered mouse reports with a size of 8 bytes, so we need
   to extend the unnumbered mouse report handling to support reports upto
   8 bytes large

2) It mouse reports have the same high-resolution format as those from the
   gaming mouse receivers

3) It can report consumer/multimedia buttons on its second interface, since
   this is a mouse-only receiver these must be forwarded to the mouse child
   device and not to the keyboard child-device (which will not exist)
