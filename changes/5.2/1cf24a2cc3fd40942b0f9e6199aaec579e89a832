arm64/module: deal with ambiguity in PRELxx relocation ranges

The R_AARCH64_PREL16 and R_AARCH64_PREL32 relocations are
documented as permitting a range of [-2^15 .. 2^16), resp.
[-2^31 .. 2^32). It is also documented that this means we
cannot detect overflow in some cases, which is bad.

Since we always interpret the targets of these relocations as
signed quantities (e.g., in the ksymtab handling code), let's
tighten the overflow checks so that targets that are out of
range for our signed interpretation of the relocated quantity
get flagged.
