habanalabs: ASIC_AUTO_DETECT enum value is redundant

This patch removes the enum value of ASIC_AUTO_DETECT because we can use
the validity of the pdev variable to know whether we have a real device or
a simulator. For a real device, we detect the asic type from the device ID
while for a simulator, the simulator code calls create_hdev() with the
specified ASIC type.

Set ASIC_INVALID as the first option in the enum to make sure that no
other enum value will receive the value 0 (which indicates a non-existing
entry in the simulator array).
