lockref: Limit number of cmpxchg loop retries

The lockref cmpxchg loop is unbound as long as the spinlock is not
taken. Depending on the hardware implementation of compare-and-swap
a high number of loop retries might happen.

Add an upper bound to the loop to force the fallback to spinlocks
after some time. A retry value of 100 should not impact any hardware
that does not have this issue.

With the retry limit the performance of an open-close testcase
improved between 60-70% on ThunderX2.
