MIPS: jump_label: Remove redundant nops

Both arch_static_branch() & arch_static_branch_jump() emit a control
transfer instruction (ie. branch or jump) without disabling assembler
re-ordering. As such the assembler will automatically fill their delay
slots.

Both functions follow their branch or jump with an explicit nop that at
first appears to be there to fill the delay slot, but given that the
assembler will do that the explicit nops serve no purpose & we end up
with our branch or jump followed by 2 nops. Remove the redundant nops.
