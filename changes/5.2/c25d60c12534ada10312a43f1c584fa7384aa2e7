selftests: bpf: complete sub-register zero extension checks

eBPF ISA specification requires high 32-bit cleared when only low 32-bit
sub-register is written. JIT back-ends must guarantee this semantics when
doing code-gen.

This patch complete unit tests for all of those insns that could be visible
to JIT back-ends and defining sub-registers, if JIT back-ends failed to
guarantee the mentioned semantics, these unit tests will fail.
