rtc: digicolor: fix possible race condition

The IRQ is requested before the struct rtc is allocated and registered, but
this struct is used in the IRQ handler. This may lead to a NULL pointer
dereference.

Switch to devm_rtc_allocate_device/rtc_register_device to allocate the rtc
struct before requesting the IRQ.
