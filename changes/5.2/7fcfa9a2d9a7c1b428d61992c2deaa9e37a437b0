perf list: Fix s390 counter long description for L1D_RO_EXCL_WRITES

Command

  # perf list --long-desc pmu

lists the long description of the available counters. For counter
named L1D_RO_EXCL_WRITES on machine types 3906 and 3907 the long
description contains the counter number 'Counter:128 Name:'
prefix. This is wrong.

The fix changes the description text and removes this prefix.

Output before:

  [root@m35lp76 perf]# ./perf list --long-desc pmu
   ...
   L1D_ONDRAWER_L4_SOURCED_WRITES
    [A directory write to the Level-1 Data cache directory where the
     returned cache line was sourced from On-Drawer Level-4 cache]

   L1D_RO_EXCL_WRITES
    [Counter:128 Name:L1D_RO_EXCL_WRITES A directory write to the Level-1
     Data cache where the line was originally in a Read-Only state in the
     cache but has been updated to be in the Exclusive state that allows
     stores to the cache line]

   ...

Output after:

  [root@m35lp76 perf]# ./perf list --long-desc pmu
   ...
   L1D_ONDRAWER_L4_SOURCED_WRITES
    [A directory write to the Level-1 Data cache directory where the
