drm/i915/psr: Only lookup for enabled CRTCs when forcing a fastset

Forcing a specific CRTC to the eDP connector was causing the
intel_psr_fastset_force() to mark mode_chaged in the wrong and
disabled CRTC causing no update in the PSR state.

Looks like our internal state track do not clear output_types and
has_psr in the disabled CRTCs, not sure if this is the expected
behavior or not but in the mean time this fix the issue.
