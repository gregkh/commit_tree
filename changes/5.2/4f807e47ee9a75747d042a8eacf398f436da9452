thunderbolt: Add support for Display Port tunnels

Display Port tunnels are somewhat more complex than PCIe tunnels as it
requires 3 tunnels (AUX Rx/Tx and Video). In addition we are not
supposed to create the tunnels immediately when a DP OUT is enumerated.
Instead we need to wait until we get hotplug event to that adapter port
or check if the port has HPD set before tunnels can be established. This
adds Display Port tunneling support to the software connection manager.
