rtw88: Make RA_MASK macros ULL

Clang warns about the definitions of these macros (full warnings trimmed
for brevity):

drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw88/main.c:524:15: warning: signed shift
result (0x3FF00000000) requires 43 bits to represent, but 'int' only has
32 bits [-Wshift-overflow]
                        ra_mask &= RA_MASK_VHT_RATES | RA_MASK_OFDM_IN_VHT;
                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw88/main.c:527:15: warning: signed shift
result (0xFF0000000) requires 37 bits to represent, but 'int' only has
32 bits [-Wshift-overflow]
                        ra_mask &= RA_MASK_HT_RATES | RA_MASK_OFDM_IN_HT_5G;
                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given that these are all used with ra_mask, which is of type u64, we can
just declare the macros to be ULL as well.
