drm/i915: Don't claim an unstarted request was guilty

If we haven't even begun executing the payload of the stalled request,
then we should not claim that its userspace context was guilty of
submitting a hanging batch.

v2: Check for context corruption before trying to restart.
v3: Preserve semaphores on skipping requests (need to keep the timelines
intact).
