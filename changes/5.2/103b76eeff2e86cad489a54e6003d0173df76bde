drm/i915: Use i915_global_register()

Rather than manually add every new global into each hook, use
i915_global_register() function and keep a list of registered globals to
invoke instead.

However, I haven't found a way for random drivers to add an .init table
to avoid having to manually add ourselves to i915_globals_init() each
time.
