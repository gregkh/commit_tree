afs: Provide mount-time configurable byte-range file locking emulation

Provide byte-range file locking emulation that can be configured at mount
time to one of four modes:

 (1) flock=local.  Locking is done locally only and no reference is made to
     the server.

 (2) flock=openafs.  Byte-range locking is done locally only; whole-file
     locking is done with reference to the server.  Whole-file locks cannot
     be upgraded unless the client holds an exclusive lock.

 (3) flock=strict.  Byte-range and whole-file locking both require a
     sufficient whole-file lock on the server.

 (4) flock=write.  As strict, but the client always gets an exclusive
     whole-file lock on the server.
