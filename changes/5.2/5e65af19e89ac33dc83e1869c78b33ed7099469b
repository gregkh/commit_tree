mm/page_isolation.c: remove redundant pfn_valid_within() in __first_valid_page()

pfn_valid_within() calls pfn_valid() when CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE making it
redundant for both definitions (w/wo CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG) of the helper
pfn_to_online_page() which either calls pfn_valid() or pfn_valid_within().
pfn_valid_within() being 1 when !CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE is irrelevant
either way.  This does not change functionality.
