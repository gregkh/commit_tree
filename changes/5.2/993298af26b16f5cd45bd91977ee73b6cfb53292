drm/i915: Yet another if/else sort of newer to older platforms.

No functional change. Just a reorg to match the preferred
behavior.

When rebasing internal branch on top of latest sort I noticed
few more cases that needs to get reordered.

Let's do in a bundle this time and hoping there's no other
missing places.

v2: Check for HSW/BDW ULT before generic IS_HASWELL or
    IS_BROADWELL or it doesn't work as pointed by Ville.
    But also ULT came afterwards anyway.
v3: Accepting suggestions from Lucas:
    Sort CNL/CFL, KBL/SKL, and use <= 8 removing chv and bdw.
