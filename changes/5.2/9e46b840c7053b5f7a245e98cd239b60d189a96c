ovl: support stacked SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA

Overlay file f_pos is the master copy that is preserved
through copy up and modified on read/write, but only real
fs knows how to SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA and real fs may impose
limitations that are more strict than ->s_maxbytes for specific
files, so we use the real file to perform seeks.

We do not call real fs for SEEK_CUR:0 query and for SEEK_SET:0
requests.
