drm: Add Y2xx and Y4xx (xx:10/12/16) format definitions and fourcc

The following pixel formats are packed format that follows 4:2:2
chroma sampling. For memory represenation each component is
allocated 16 bits each. Thus each pixel occupies 32bit.

Y210:	For each component, valid data occupies MSB 10 bits.
	LSB 6 bits are filled with zeroes.
Y212:	For each component, valid data occupies MSB 12 bits.
	LSB 4 bits are filled with zeroes.
Y216:	For each component valid data occupies 16 bits,
	doesn't require any padding bits.

First 16 bits stores the Y value and the next 16 bits stores one
of the chroma samples alternatively. The first luma sample will
be accompanied by first U sample and second luma sample is
accompanied by the first V sample.

The following pixel formats are packed format that follows 4:4:4
chroma sampling. Channels are arranged in the order UYVA in
increasing memory order.

Y410:	Each color component occupies 10 bits and X component
	takes 2 bits, thus each pixel occupies 32 bits.
Y412:   Each color component is 16 bits where valid data
	occupies MSB 12 bits. LSB 4 bits are filled with zeroes.
	Thus, each pixel occupies 64 bits.
Y416:   Each color component occupies 16 bits for valid data,
	doesn't require any padding bits. Thus, each pixel
	occupies 64 bits.

v3: fixed missing tab for XYUV8888 (JP)
