dmaengine: tegra210-adma: use devm_clk_*() helpers

adma driver is using pm_clk_*() interface for managing clock resources.
With this it is observed that clocks remain ON always. This happens on
Tegra devices which use BPMP co-processor to manage clock resources,
where clocks are enabled during prepare phase. This is necessary because
clocks to BPMP are always blocking. When pm_clk_*() interface is used on
such Tegra devices, clock prepare count is not balanced till remove call
happens for the driver and hence clocks are seen ON always. Thus this
patch replaces pm_clk_*() with devm_clk_*() framework.
