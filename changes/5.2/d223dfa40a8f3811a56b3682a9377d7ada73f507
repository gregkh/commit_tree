net: hns3: split function hnae3_match_n_instantiate()

The function hnae3_match_n_instantiate() was called both by
initializing or uninitializing client. For uninitializing, the
return value was never used.

To make it more clear, this patch splits it to two functions,
hnae3_init_client_instance() and hnae3_uninit_client_instance().
