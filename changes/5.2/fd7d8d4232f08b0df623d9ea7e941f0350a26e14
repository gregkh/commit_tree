block: don't merge adjacent bvecs to one segment in bio blk_queue_split

For normal filesystem IO, each page is added via blk_add_page(),
in which bvec(page) merge has been handled already, and basically
not possible to merge two adjacent bvecs in one bio.

So not try to merge two adjacent bvecs in blk_queue_split().
