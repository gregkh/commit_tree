ALSA: hda/realtek - Improve the headset mic for Acer Aspire laptops

We met another Acer Aspire laptop which has the problem on the
headset-mic, the Pin 0x19 is not set the corret configuration for a
mic and the pin presence can't be detected too after plugging a
headset. Kailang suggested that we should set the coeff to enable the
mic and apply the ALC269_FIXUP_LIFEBOOK_EXTMIC. After doing that,
both headset-mic presence and headset-mic work well.

The existing ALC255_FIXUP_ACER_MIC_NO_PRESENCE set the headset-mic
jack to be a phantom jack. Now since the jack can support presence
unsol event, let us imporve it to set the jack to be a normal jack.
