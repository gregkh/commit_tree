drivers: clk: Update clock driver to handle clock attribute

Versal EEMI APIs uses clock device ID which is combination of class,
subclass, type and clock index (e.g. 0x8104006 in which 0-13 bits are
for index(6 in given example), 14-19 bits are for clock type (i.e pll,
out or ref, 1 in given example), 20-25 bits are for subclass which is
nothing but clock type only), 26-32 bits are for device class, which
is clock(0x2) for all clocks) while zynqmp firmware uses clock ID
which is index only (e.g 0, 1, to n, where n is max_clock id).

To use zynqmp clock driver for versal platform also, extend use
of QueryAttribute API to fetch device class, subclass and clock type
to create clock device ID. In case of zynqmp this attributes would be
0 only, so there won't be any effect on clock id as it would use
clock index only.
