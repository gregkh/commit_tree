drm/amdgpu: use ring/hash for fault handling on GMC9 v3

Further testing showed that the idea with the chash doesn't work as expected.
Especially we can't predict when we can remove the entries from the hash again.

So replace the chash with a ring buffer/hash mix where entries in the container
age automatically based on their timestamp.

v2: use ring buffer / hash mix
v3: check the timeout to make sure all entries age
