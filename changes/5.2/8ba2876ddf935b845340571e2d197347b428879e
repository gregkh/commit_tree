habanalabs: add goya implementation for debug configuration

This patch adds the ASIC-specific function for GOYA to configure the
coresight components.

Most of the components have an enabled/disabled flag, depending on whether
the user wants to enable the component or disable it.

For some of the components, such as ETR and SPMU, the user can also
request to read values from them. Those values are needed for the user to
parse the trace data.

The ETR configuration is also checked for security purposes, to make sure
the trace data is written to the device's DRAM.
