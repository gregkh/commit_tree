Documentation: add TLS offload documentation

Describe existing kernel TLS offload (added back in Linux 4.19) -
the mechanism, the expected behavior and the notable corner cases.

This documentation is mostly targeting hardware vendors who want
to implement offload, to ensure consistency between implementations.

v2:
 - add emphasis around TLS_SW/TLS_HW/TLS_HW_RECORD;
 - remove mentions of ongoing work (Boris);
 - split the flow of data in SW vs. HW cases in TX overview
   (Boris);
 - call out which fields are updated by the device and which
   are filled by the stack (Boris);
 - move error handling into it's own section (Boris);
 - add more words about fallback (Boris);
 - note that checksum validation is required (Alexei);
 - note that drivers shouldn't pay attention to the TLS
   device features.
