ASoC: rt5645: Headphone Jack sense inverts on the LattePanda board

The LattePanda board has a sound card chtrt5645, when there is nothing
plugged in the headphone jack, the system thinks the headphone is
plugged in, while we plug a headphone in the jack, the system thinks
the headphone is unplugged.

If adding quirk=0x21 in the module parameter, the headphone jack can
work well. So let us fix it via platform_data.
