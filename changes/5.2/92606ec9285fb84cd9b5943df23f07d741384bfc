arm64: cpu_ops: fix a leaked reference by adding missing of_node_put

The call to of_get_next_child returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented thus it must be explicitly decremented after the last
usage.

Detected by coccinelle with the following warnings:
  ./arch/arm64/kernel/cpu_ops.c:102:1-7: ERROR: missing of_node_put;
  acquired a node pointer with refcount incremented on line 69, but
  without a corresponding object release within this function.
