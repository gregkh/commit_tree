netfilter: nf_conntrack_h323: restore boundary check correctness

Since commit bc7d811ace4a ("netfilter: nf_ct_h323: Convert
CHECK_BOUND macro to function"), NAT traversal for H.323
doesn't work, failing to parse H323-UserInformation.
nf_h323_error_boundary() compares contents of the bitstring,
not the addresses, preventing valid H.323 packets from being
conntrack'd.

This looks like an oversight from when CHECK_BOUND macro was
converted to a function.

To fix it, stop dereferencing bs->cur and bs->end.
