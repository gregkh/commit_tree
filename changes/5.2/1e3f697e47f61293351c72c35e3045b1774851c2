drm/i915/execlists: Suppress redundant preemption

On unwinding the active request we give it a small (limited to internal
priority levels) boost to prevent it from being gazumped a second time.
However, this means that it can be promoted to above the request that
triggered the preemption request, causing a preempt-to-idle cycle for no
change. We can avoid this if we take the boost into account when
checking if the preemption request is valid.

v2: After preemption the active request will be after the preemptee if
they end up with equal priority.

v3: Tvrtko pointed out that this, the existing logic, makes
I915_PRIORITY_WAIT non-preemptible. Document this interesting quirk!

v4: Prove Tvrtko was right about WAIT being non-preemptible and test it.
v5: Except not all priorities were made equal, and the WAIT not preempting
is only if we start off as !NEWCLIENT.

v6: More commentary after coming to an understanding about what I had
forgotten to say.
