rtlwifi: Fix duplicate tests of one of the RX descriptors

In drivers rtl8188ee, rtl8821ae, rtl8723be, and rtl8192ee, the reason
for a wake-up is returned in the fourth RX descriptor in bits 29-31. Due
to typographical errors, all but rtl8821ae test bit 31 twice and fail to
test bit 29.

This error causes no problems as the tests are only used to set bits in
the output of an optional debugging statement.
