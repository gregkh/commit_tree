staging: wlan-ng: fix adapter initialization failure

Commit e895f00a8496 ("Staging: wlan-ng: hfa384x_usb.c Fixed too long
code line warnings.") moved the retrieval of the transfer buffer from
the URB from the top of function hfa384x_usbin_callback to a point
after reposting of the URB via a call to submit_rx_urb. The reposting
of the URB allocates a new transfer buffer so the new buffer is
retrieved instead of the buffer containing the response passed into
the callback. This results in failure to initialize the adapter with
an error reported in the system log (something like "CTLX[1] error:
state(Request failed)").

This change moves the retrieval to just before the point where the URB
is reposted so that the correct transfer buffer is retrieved and
initialization of the device succeeds.
