mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add erratum eSDHC7 support

Invalid Transfer Complete (IRQSTAT[TC]) bit could be set during
multi-write operation even when the BLK_CNT in BLKATTR register
has not reached zero. Therefore, Transfer Complete might be
reported twice due to this erratum since a valid Transfer Complete
occurs when BLK_CNT reaches zero. This erratum is to fix this issue
