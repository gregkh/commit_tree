btrfs: Turn an 'else if' into an 'else' in btrfs_uuid_tree_add

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

fs/btrfs/uuid-tree.c:129:13: warning: variable 'eb' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
fs/btrfs/uuid-tree.c:129:13: warning: variable 'offset' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

Clang can't tell that all cases are covered with this final else if.
Just turn it into an else so that it is clear.
