ceph: flush dirty inodes before proceeding with remount

xfstest generic/452 was triggering a "Busy inodes after umount" warning.
ceph was allowing the mount to go read-only without first flushing out
dirty inodes in the cache. Ensure we sync out the filesystem before
allowing a remount to proceed.
