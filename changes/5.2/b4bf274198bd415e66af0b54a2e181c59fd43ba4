csky: Add perf_arch_fetch_caller_regs support

In trace events as tracepoints context are not able to
be retrieve with task_pt_regs. Without arch caller regs
support the pt_regs context will be all zero, perf can
not parsing the callchain and resolving the symbols
correctly, some time will even get into deadlock
while handling the page fault, eg:

perf kmem â€”page record ls
