HID: logitech-hidpp: Add support for the S510 remote control

The S510 remote-control shows up as a second keyboard (keypad) on the
receiver. It has a scroll-wheel, which normally sends wheel event
originating from the mouse's evdev node.

Add a HIDPP_QUIRK_KBD_SCROLL_WHEEL quirk for it, so that the wheel events
properly originate from the evdev node of the remote control itself.
