mm/hmm: use reference counting for HMM struct

Every time I read the code to check that the HMM structure does not vanish
before it should thanks to the many lock protecting its removal i get a
headache.  Switch to reference counting instead it is much easier to
follow and harder to break.  This also remove some code that is no longer
needed with refcounting.
