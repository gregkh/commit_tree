ipv6: Default fib6_type to RTN_UNICAST when not set

A user reported that routes are getting installed with type 0 (RTN_UNSPEC)
where before the routes were RTN_UNICAST. One example is from accel-ppp
which apparently still uses the ioctl interface and does not set
rtmsg_type. Another is the netlink interface where ipv6 does not require
rtm_type to be set (v4 does). Prior to the commit in the Fixes tag the
ipv6 stack converted type 0 to RTN_UNICAST, so restore that behavior.

Fixes: e8478e80e5a7 ("net/ipv6: Save route type in rt6_info")
