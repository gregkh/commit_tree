scsi: lpfc: Fix nvmet handling of first burst cmd

With negative test injection, the driver is receiving a command with first
burst enabled, meaning Sequence initiative is not passed with the command
frame. The driver notes the condition and discards the frame.  However the
driver calls the incorrect buffer free routine, resulting in a NULL pointer
reference.

For hbq buffer free, convert to using lpfc_rq_buf_free().
