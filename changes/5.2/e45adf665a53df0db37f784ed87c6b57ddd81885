KVM: Introduce a new guest mapping API

In KVM, specially for nested guests, there is a dominant pattern of:

	=> map guest memory -> do_something -> unmap guest memory

In addition to all this unnecessarily noise in the code due to boiler plate
code, most of the time the mapping function does not properly handle memory
that is not backed by "struct page". This new guest mapping API encapsulate
most of this boiler plate code and also handles guest memory that is not
backed by "struct page".

The current implementation of this API is using memremap for memory that is
not backed by a "struct page" which would lead to a huge slow-down if it
was used for high-frequency mapping operations. The API does not have any
effect on current setups where guest memory is backed by a "struct page".
Further patches are going to also introduce a pfn-cache which would
significantly improve the performance of the memremap case.
