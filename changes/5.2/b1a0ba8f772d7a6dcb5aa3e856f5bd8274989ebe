brcmfmac: Add DMI nvram filename quirk for ACEPC T8 and T11 mini PCs

The ACEPC T8 and T11 mini PCs contain quite generic names in the sys_vendor
and product_name DMI strings, without this patch brcmfmac will try to load:
"brcmfmac43455-sdio.Default string-Default string.txt" as nvram file which
is way too generic.

The DMI strings on which we are matching are somewhat generic too, but
"To be filled by O.E.M." is less common then "Default string" and the
system-sku and bios-version strings are pretty unique. Beside the DMI
strings we also check the wifi-module chip-id and revision. I'm confident
that the combination of all this is unique.

Both the T8 and T11 use the same wifi-module, this commit adds DMI
quirks for both mini PCs pointing to brcmfmac43455-sdio.acepc-t8.txt .
