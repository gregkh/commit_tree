ipv4: Add fib_nh_common to fib_result

Most of the ipv4 code only needs data from fib_nh_common. Add
fib_nh_common selection to fib_result and update users to use it.

Right now, fib_nh_common in fib_result will point to a fib_nh struct
that is embedded within a fib_info:

        fib_info  --> fib_nh
                      fib_nh
                      ...
                      fib_nh
                        ^
    fib_result->nhc ----+

Later, nhc can point to a fib_nh within a nexthop struct:

        fib_info --> nexthop --> fib_nh
                                   ^
    fib_result->nhc ---------------+

or for a nexthop group:

        fib_info --> nexthop --> nexthop --> fib_nh
                                 nexthop --> fib_nh
                                 ...
                                 nexthop --> fib_nh
                                               ^
    fib_result->nhc ---------------------------+

In all cases nhsel within fib_result will point to which leg in the
multipath route is used.
