drm/arm/malidp:- Disregard the pitch alignment constraint for AFBC framebuffer.

Considering the fact that some of the AFBC specific pixel formats are expressed
in bits per pixel (ie bpp which is not byte aligned), the pitch (ie width * bpp)
is not guaranteed to be aligned to burst size (ie 8 or 16 bytes).
For example, DRM_FORMAT_VUY101010 is 30 bits per pixel. For a framebuffer of
width 32 pixels, the pitch will be 120 bytes which is not aligned to burst size
(ie 16 bytes) for DP650.

Changes since v3 (series):
- Added the ack
- Rebased on the latest drm-misc-next
