afs: Get YFS ACLs and information through xattrs

The YFS/AuriStor variant of AFS provides more capable ACLs and provides
per-volume ACLs and per-file ACLs as well as per-directory ACLs.  It also
provides some extra information that can be retrieved through four ACLs:

 (1) afs.yfs.acl

     The YFS file ACL (not the same format as afs.acl).

 (2) afs.yfs.vol_acl

     The YFS volume ACL.

 (3) afs.yfs.acl_inherited

     "1" if a file's ACL is inherited from its parent directory, "0"
     otherwise.

 (4) afs.yfs.acl_num_cleaned

     The number of of ACEs removed from the ACL by the server because the
     PT entries were removed from the PTS database (ie. the subject is no
     longer known).
