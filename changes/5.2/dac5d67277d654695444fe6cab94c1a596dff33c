clk: mediatek: Allow changing PLL rate when it is off

Some modules may need to change its clock rate before turn on it.
So changing PLL's rate when it is off should be allowed.
This patch removes PLL enabled check before set rate, so that
PLLs can set new frequency even if they are off.

On MT8173 for example, ARMPLL's enable bit can be controlled by
other HW. That means ARMPLL may be turned on even if we (CPU / SW)
set ARMPLL's enable bit as 0. In this case, SW may want and can
still change ARMPLL's rate by changing its pcw and postdiv settings.
But without this patch, new pcw setting will not be applied because
its enable bit is 0.
