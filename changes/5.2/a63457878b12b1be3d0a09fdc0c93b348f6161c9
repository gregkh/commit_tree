net: hns3: Add handling of MAC tunnel interruption

MAC tnl interruptions are different from other type of RAS and MSI-X
errors, because some bits, such as OVF/LR/RF will occur during link up
and down.

The drivers should clear status of all MAC tnl interruption bits but
shouldn't print any message that would mislead the users.

In case that link down and re-up in a short time because of some reasons,
we record when they occurred, and users can query them by debugfs.
