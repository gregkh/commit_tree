btrfs: Handle pending/pinned chunks before blockgroup relocation during device shrink

During device shrink pinned/pending chunks (i.e. those which have been
deleted/created respectively, in the current transaction and haven't
touched disk) need to be accounted when doing device shrink. Presently
this happens after the main relocation loop in btrfs_shrink_device,
which could lead to making another go in the body of the function.

Since there is no hard requirement to perform pinned/pending chunks
handling after the relocation loop, move the code before it. This leads
to simplifying the code flow around - i.e. no need to use 'goto again'.

A notable side effect of this change is that modification of the
device's size requires a transaction to be started and committed before
the relocation loop starts. This is necessary to ensure that relocation
process sees the shrunk device size.
