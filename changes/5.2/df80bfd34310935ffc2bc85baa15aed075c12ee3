crypto: caam/jr - update gcm detection logic

GCM detection logic has to change for two reasons:
-some CAAM instantiations with Era < 10, even though they have AES LP,
they now support GCM mode
-Era 10 upwards, there is a dedicated bit in AESA_VERSION[AESA_MISC]
field for GCM support

For Era 9 and earlier, all AES accelerator versions support GCM,
except for AES LP (CHAVID_LS[AESVID]=3) with revision CRNR[AESRN] < 8.

For Era 10 and later, bit 9 of the AESA_VERSION register should be used
to detect GCM support in AES accelerator.

Note: caam/qi and caam/qi2 are drivers for QI (Queue Interface), which
is used in DPAA-based SoCs; for now, we rely on CAAM having an AES HP
and this AES accelerator having support for GCM.
