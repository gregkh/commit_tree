net: aquantia: fix LRO with FCS error

Driver stops producing skbs on ring if a packet with FCS error
was coalesced into LRO session. Ring gets hang forever.

Thats a logical error in driver processing descriptors:
When rx_stat indicates MAC Error, next pointer and eop flags
are not filled. This confuses driver so it waits for descriptor 0
to be filled by HW.

Solution is fill next pointer and eop flag even for packets with FCS error.
