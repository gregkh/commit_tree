spi: bcm2835aux: warn in dmesg that native cs is not really supported

From personal bad experience (even as the author of the original driver)
it shows that native-cs is "somewhat" supported by the spi bus driver
when using a buggy device tree.

So make sure that the driver is warning in dmesg about this fact
that we are running in a not supported mode that may have surprizing
limitations.
