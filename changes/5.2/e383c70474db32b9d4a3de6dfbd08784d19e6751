rt2x00: check number of EPROTO errors

Some USB host devices/drivers on some conditions can always return
EPROTO error on submitted URBs. That can cause infinity loop in the
rt2x00 driver.

Since we can have single EPROTO errors we can not mark as device as
removed to avoid infinity loop. However we can count consecutive
EPROTO errors and mark device as removed if get lot of it.
I choose number 10 as threshold.
