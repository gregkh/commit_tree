lib/plist: rename DEBUG_PI_LIST to DEBUG_PLIST

This is a lot more appropriate than PI_LIST, which in the kernel one
would assume that it has to do with priority-inheritance; which is not
-- furthermore futexes make use of plists so this can be even more
confusing, albeit the debug nature of the config option.
