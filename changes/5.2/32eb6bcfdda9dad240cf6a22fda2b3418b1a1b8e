drm/i915: Make request allocation caches global

As kmem_caches share the same properties (size, allocation/free behaviour)
for all potential devices, we can use global caches. While this
potential has worse fragmentation behaviour (one can argue that
different devices would have different activity lifetimes, but you can
also argue that activity is temporal across the system) it is the
default behaviour of the system at large to amalgamate matching caches.

The benefit for us is much reduced pointer dancing along the frequent
allocation paths.

v2: Defer shrinking until after a global grace period for futureproofing
multiple consumers of the slab caches, similar to the current strategy
for avoiding shrinking too early.
