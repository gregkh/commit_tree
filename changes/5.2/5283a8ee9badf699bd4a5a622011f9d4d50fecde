crypto: testmgr - expand ability to test for errors

Update testmgr to support testing for specific errors from setkey() and
digest() for hashes; setkey() and encrypt()/decrypt() for skciphers and
ciphers; and setkey(), setauthsize(), and encrypt()/decrypt() for AEADs.
This is useful because algorithms usually restrict the lengths or format
of the message, key, and/or authentication tag in some way.  And bad
inputs should be tested too, not just good inputs.

As part of this change, remove the ambiguously-named 'fail' flag and
replace it with 'setkey_error = -EINVAL' for the only test vector that
used it -- the DES weak key test vector.  Note that this tightens the
test to require -EINVAL rather than any error code, but AFAICS this
won't cause any test failure.

Other than that, these new fields aren't set on any test vectors yet.
Later patches will do so.
