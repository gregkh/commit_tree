rtc: mxc_v2: use dev_pm_set_wake_irq() to simplify code

With calling dev_pm_set_wake_irq() to set MXC_V2 RTC as wakeup source
for suspend, generic wake irq mechanism will automatically enable
it as wakeup source when suspend, then the suspend/resume callback
which are ONLY for enabling/disabling irq wake can be removed, it
simplifies the code.
