Btrfs: tree-checker: detect file extent items with overlapping ranges

Having file extent items with ranges that overlap each other is a
serious issue that leads to all sorts of corruptions and crashes (like a
BUG_ON() during the course of __btrfs_drop_extents() when it traims file
extent items). Therefore teach the tree checker to detect such cases.
This is motivated by a recently fixed bug (race between ranged full
fsync and writeback or adjacent ranges).
