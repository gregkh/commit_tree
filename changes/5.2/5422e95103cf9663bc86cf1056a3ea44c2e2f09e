KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Replace the 'destroy' method by a 'release' method

When a P9 sPAPR VM boots, the CAS negotiation process determines which
interrupt mode to use (XICS legacy or XIVE native) and invokes a
machine reset to activate the chosen mode.

We introduce 'release' methods for the XICS-on-XIVE and the XIVE
native KVM devices which are called when the file descriptor of the
device is closed after the TIMA and ESB pages have been unmapped.
They perform the necessary cleanups : clear the vCPU interrupt
presenters that could be attached and then destroy the device. The
'release' methods replace the 'destroy' methods as 'destroy' is not
called anymore once 'release' is. Compatibility with older QEMU is
nevertheless maintained.

This is not considered as a safe operation as the vCPUs are still
running and could be referencing the KVM device through their
presenters. To protect the system from any breakage, the kvmppc_xive
objects representing both KVM devices are now stored in an array under
the VM. Allocation is performed on first usage and memory is freed
only when the VM exits.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - Moved freeing of xive structures to book3s.c,
 put it under #ifdef CONFIG_KVM_XICS.]
