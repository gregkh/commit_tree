KVM: x86: Modify struct kvm_nested_state to have explicit fields for data

Improve the KVM_{GET,SET}_NESTED_STATE structs by detailing the format
of VMX nested state data in a struct.

In order to avoid changing the ioctl values of
KVM_{GET,SET}_NESTED_STATE, there is a need to preserve
sizeof(struct kvm_nested_state). This is done by defining the data
struct as "data.vmx[0]". It was the most elegant way I found to
preserve struct size while still keeping struct readable and easy to
maintain. It does have a misfortunate side-effect that now it has to be
accessed as "data.vmx[0]" rather than just "data.vmx".

Because we are already modifying these structs, I also modified the
following:
* Define the "format" field values as macros.
* Rename vmcs_pa to vmcs12_pa for better readability.
