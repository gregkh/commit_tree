rxrpc: Mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warning:

net/rxrpc/local_object.c: In function ‘rxrpc_open_socket’:
net/rxrpc/local_object.c:175:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
   if (ret < 0) {
      ^
net/rxrpc/local_object.c:184:2: note: here
  case AF_INET:
  ^~~~

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

Currently, GCC is expecting to find the fall-through annotations
at the very bottom of the case and on its own line. That's why
I had to add the annotation, although the intentional fall-through
is already mentioned in a few lines above.

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
