asm-generic/mmiowb: Add generic implementation of mmiowb() tracking

In preparation for removing all explicit mmiowb() calls from driver
code, implement a tracking system in asm-generic based loosely on the
PowerPC implementation. This allows architectures with a non-empty
mmiowb() definition to have the barrier automatically inserted in
spin_unlock() following a critical section containing an I/O write.
