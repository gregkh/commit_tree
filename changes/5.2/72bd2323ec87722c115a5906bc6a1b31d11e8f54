Btrfs: do not abort transaction at btrfs_update_root() after failure to COW path

Currently when we fail to COW a path at btrfs_update_root() we end up
always aborting the transaction. However all the current callers of
btrfs_update_root() are able to deal with errors returned from it, many do
end up aborting the transaction themselves (directly or not, such as the
transaction commit path), other BUG_ON() or just gracefully cancel whatever
they were doing.

When syncing the fsync log, we call btrfs_update_root() through
tree-log.c:update_log_root(), and if it returns an -ENOSPC error, the log
sync code does not abort the transaction, instead it gracefully handles
the error and returns -EAGAIN to the fsync handler, so that it falls back
to a transaction commit. Any other error different from -ENOSPC, makes the
log sync code abort the transaction.

So remove the transaction abort from btrfs_update_log() when we fail to
COW a path to update the root item, so that if an -ENOSPC failure happens
we avoid aborting the current transaction and have a chance of the fsync
succeeding after falling back to a transaction commit.
