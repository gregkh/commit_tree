math64: New DIV64_U64_ROUND_CLOSEST helper

Provide DIV64_U64_ROUND_CLOSEST helper which performs division rounded to
the closest integer using an unsigned 64bit dividend and divisor.

This will be used in a follow-up patch to allow calculation of clock
divisors with high frequency parents in the R-Car Gen3 CPG MSSR driver
where overflow occurs if either the dividend or divisor is 32bit.
