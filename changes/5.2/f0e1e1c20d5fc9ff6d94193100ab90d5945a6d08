iwlwifi: dbg_ini: change memory range base address to u64

AX210 devices will use u64 for the base address to the DRAM monitor
buffer. To support this, change the structure for all device families
so both address sizes fit.

Also move range_data_size to the top of the struct to ease the parsing
of the memory range.
