dt-bindings: riscv: convert cpu binding to json-schema

At Rob's request, we're starting to migrate our DT binding
documentation to json-schema YAML format.  Start by converting our cpu
binding documentation.  While doing so, document more properties and
nodes.  This includes adding binding documentation support for the E51
and U54 CPU cores ("harts") that are present on this SoC.  These cores
are described in:

    https://static.dev.sifive.com/FU540-C000-v1.0.pdf

This cpus.yaml file is intended to be a starting point and to
evolve over time.  It passes dt-doc-validate as of the yaml-bindings
commit 4c79d42e9216.

This patch was originally based on the ARM json-schema binding
documentation as added by commit 672951cbd1b7 ("dt-bindings: arm: Convert
cpu binding to json-schema").
