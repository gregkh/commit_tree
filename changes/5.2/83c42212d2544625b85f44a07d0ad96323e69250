i2c: core: use I2C locking behaviour also for SMBUS

If I2C transfers are executed in atomic contexts, trylock is used
instead of lock. This behaviour was missing for SMBUS, although a lot of
transfers are of SMBUS type, either emulated or direct. So, factor out
the locking routine into a helper and use it for I2C and SMBUS.
