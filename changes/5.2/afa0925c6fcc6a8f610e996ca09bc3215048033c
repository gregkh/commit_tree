packet: unconditionally free po->rollover

Rollover used to use a complex RCU mechanism for assignment, which had
a race condition. The below patch fixed the bug and greatly simplified
the logic.

The feature depends on fanout, but the state is private to the socket.
Fanout_release returns f only when the last member leaves and the
fanout struct is to be freed.

Destroy rollover unconditionally, regardless of fanout state.
