fs: drop unused fput_atomic definition

commit d7065da03822 ("get rid of the magic around f_count in aio") added
fput_atomic to include/linux/fs.h, motivated by its use in __aio_put_req()
in fs/aio.c.

Later, commit 3ffa3c0e3f6e ("aio: now fput() is OK from interrupt context;
get rid of manual delayed __fput()") removed the only use of fput_atomic
in __aio_put_req(), but did not remove the since then unused fput_atomic
definition in include/linux/fs.h.

We curate this now and finally remove the unused definition.

This issue was identified during a code review due to a coccinelle warning
from the atomic_as_refcounter.cocci rule pointing to the use of atomic_t
in fput_atomic.
