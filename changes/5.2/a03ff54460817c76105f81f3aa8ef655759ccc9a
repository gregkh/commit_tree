USB: Fix slab-out-of-bounds write in usb_get_bos_descriptor

The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a slab-out-of-bounds write bug in the
USB core, caused by a failure to check the actual size of a BOS
descriptor.  This patch adds a check to make sure the descriptor is at
least as large as it is supposed to be, so that the code doesn't
inadvertently access memory beyond the end of the allocated region
when assigning to dev->bos->desc->bNumDeviceCaps later on.
