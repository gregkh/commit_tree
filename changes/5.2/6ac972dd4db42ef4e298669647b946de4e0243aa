tty/sysrq: Convert show_lock to raw_spinlock_t

Systems which don't provide arch_trigger_cpumask_backtrace() will
invoke showacpu() from a smp_call_function() function which is invoked
with disabled interrupts even on -RT systems.

The function acquires the show_lock lock which only purpose is to
ensure that the CPUs don't print simultaneously. Otherwise the
output would clash and it would be hard to tell the output from CPUx
apart from CPUy.

On -RT the spin_lock() can not be acquired from this context. A
raw_spin_lock() is required. It will introduce the system's latency
by performing the sysrq request and other CPUs will block on the lock
until the request is done. This is okay because the user asked for a
backtrace of all active CPUs and under "normal circumstances in
production" this path should not be triggered.
