watchdog: rtd119x_wdt: Fix remove function

The driver registers the watchdog with devm_watchdog_register_device() but
still calls watchdog_unregister_device() on remove. Since clocks have to
be stopped when removing the driver, after the watchdog device has been
unregistered, we can not drop the call to watchdog_unregister_device().
Use watchdog_register_device() to register the watchdog.
