rtnetlink: always put IFLA_LINK for links with a link-netnsid

Currently, nla_put_iflink() doesn't put the IFLA_LINK attribute when
iflink == ifindex.

In some cases, a device can be created in a different netns with the
same ifindex as its parent. That device will not dump its IFLA_LINK
attribute, which can confuse some userspace software that expects it.
For example, if the last ifindex created in init_net and foo are both
8, these commands will trigger the issue:

    ip link add parent type dummy                   # ifindex 9
    ip link add link parent netns foo type macvlan  # ifindex 9 in ns foo

So, in case a device puts the IFLA_LINK_NETNSID attribute in a dump,
always put the IFLA_LINK attribute as well.

Thanks to Dan Winship for analyzing the original OpenShift bug down to
the missing netlink attribute.
