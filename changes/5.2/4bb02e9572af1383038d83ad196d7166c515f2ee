IB/hfi1: Use aborts to trigger RC throttling

SDMA and pio flushes will cause a lot of packets to be transmitted
after a link has gone down, using a lot of CPU to retransmit
packets.

Fix for RC QPs by recognizing the flush status and:
- Forcing a timer start
- Putting the QP into a "send one" mode
