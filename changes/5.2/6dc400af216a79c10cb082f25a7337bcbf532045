xen-netback: add reference from xenvif to backend_info to facilitate coredump analysis

During coredump analysis, it is not easy to obtain the address of
backend_info in xen-netback.

So far there are two ways to obtain backend_info:

1. Do what xenbus_device_find() does for vmcore to find the xenbus_device
and then derive it from dev_get_drvdata().

2. Extract backend_info from callstack of xenwatch (e.g., netback_remove()
or frontend_changed()).

This patch adds a reference from xenvif to backend_info so that it would be
much more easier to obtain backend_info during coredump analysis.
