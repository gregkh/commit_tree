block: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

drivers/block/drbd/drbd_int.h:1774:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_int.h:1774:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

drivers/block/drbd/drbd_req.c:856:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough
