bcache: improve bcache_reboot()

This patch tries to release mutex bch_register_lock early, to give
chance to stop cache set and bcache device early.

This patch also expends time out of stopping all bcache device from
2 seconds to 10 seconds, because stopping writeback rate update worker
may delay for 5 seconds, 2 seconds is not enough.

After this patch applied, stopping bcache devices during system reboot
or shutdown is very hard to be observed any more.
