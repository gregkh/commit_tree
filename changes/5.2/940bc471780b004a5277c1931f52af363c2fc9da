dm mpath: always free attached_handler_name in parse_path()

Commit b592211c33f7 ("dm mpath: fix attached_handler_name leak and
dangling hw_handler_name pointer") fixed a memory leak for the case
where setup_scsi_dh() returns failure. But setup_scsi_dh may return
success and not "use" attached_handler_name if the
retain_attached_hwhandler flag is not set on the map. As setup_scsi_sh
properly "steals" the pointer by nullifying it, freeing it
unconditionally in parse_path() is safe.
