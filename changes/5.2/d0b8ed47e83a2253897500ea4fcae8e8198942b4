of: reserved_mem: fix reserve memory leak

The __reserved_mem_init_node will call region specific reserved memory
init codes, but once all compatibled init codes failed, the memory region
will left in memory.reserved and cause leakage.

Take cma reserve memory DTS for example, if user declare 1MB size,
which is not align to (PAGE_SIZE << max(MAX_ORDER - 1,
pageblock_order)), rmem_cma_setup will return -EINVAL.
Meanwhile, rmem_dma_setup will also return -EINVAL since "reusable"
property is not set. If finally there is no reserved memory init pick up
this memory, kernel will left the 1MB leak in memory.reserved.

This patch will remove this kind of memory from memory.reserved, only
when __reserved_mem_init_node return neither 0 nor -ENOENT.
