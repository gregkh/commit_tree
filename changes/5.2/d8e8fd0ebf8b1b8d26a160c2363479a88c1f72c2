mtd: rawnand: denali: decouple controller and NAND chips

Currently, this driver sticks to the legacy NAND model because it was
upstreamed before commit 2d472aba15ff ("mtd: nand: document the NAND
controller/NAND chip DT representation"). However, relying on the
dummy_controller is already deprecated.

Switch over to the new controller/chip representation.

The struct denali_nand_info has been split into denali_controller
and denali_chip, to contain the controller data, per-chip data,
respectively.

One problem is, this commit changes the DT binding. So, as always,
the backward compatibility must be taken into consideration.

In the new binding, the controller node expects

  #address-cells = <1>;
  #size-cells = <0>;

... since the child nodes represent NAND chips.

In the old binding, the controller node may have subnodes, but they
are MTD partitions.

The denali_dt_is_legacy_binding() exploits it to distinguish old/new
platforms.

Going forward, the old binding is only allowed for existing DT files.
I updated the binding document.
