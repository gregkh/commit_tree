ASoC: sun4i-codec: fix first delay on Speaker

Allwinner DAC seems to have a delay in the Speaker audio routing. When
playing a sound for the first time, the sound gets chopped. On a second
play the sound is played correctly. After some time (~5s) the issue gets
back.

This commit seems to be fixing the same issue as bf14da7 but
for another codepath.

This is the DTS that was used to debug the problem.

&codec {
        allwinner,pa-gpios = <&r_pio 0 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PL11 */
        allwinner,audio-routing =
                "Speaker", "LINEOUT";

        status = "okay";
}
