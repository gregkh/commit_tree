scripts/gdb: clean up error handling in list helpers

An incorrect argument to list_for_each is an internal error in gdb
scripts so a TypeError should be raised.  The gdb.GdbError exception
type is intended for user errors such as incorrect invocation.

Drop the type assertion in list_for_each_entry because list_for_each
isn't going to suddenly yield something else.

Applies to both list and hlist
