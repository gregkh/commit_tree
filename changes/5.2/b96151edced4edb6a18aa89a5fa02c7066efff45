drm/arm/hdlcd: Actually validate CRTC modes

Rather than allowing any old mode through, then subsequently refusing
unmatchable clock rates in atomic_check when it's too late to back out
and pick a different mode, let's do that validation up-front where it
will cause unsupported modes to be correctly pruned in the first place.

This also eliminates an issue whereby a perceived clock rate of 0 would
cause atomic disable to fail and prevent the module from being unloaded.
