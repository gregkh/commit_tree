block: avoid scatterlist offsets > PAGE_SIZE

While we generally allow scatterlists to have offsets larger than page
size for an entry, and other subsystems like the crypto code make use of
that, the block layer isn't quite ready for that.  Flip the switch back
to avoid them for now, and revisit that decision early in a merge window
once the known offenders are fixed.
