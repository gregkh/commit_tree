ipv4: Rename fib_nh entries

Rename fib_nh entries that will be moved to a fib_nh_common struct.
Specifically, the device, oif, gateway, flags, scope, lwtstate,
nh_weight and nh_upper_bound are common with all nexthop definitions.
In the process shorten fib_nh_lwtstate to fib_nh_lws to avoid really
long lines.

Rename only; no functional change intended.
