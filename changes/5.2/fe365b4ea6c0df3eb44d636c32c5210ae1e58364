KVM: Clarify KVM_{SET,GET}_ONE_REG error code documentation

The current error code documentation for KVM_GET_ONE_REG and
KVM_SET_ONE_REG could be read as implying that all architectures
implement these error codes, or that KVM guarantees which error
code is returned in a particular situation.

Because this is not really the case, this patch waters down the
documentation explicitly to remove such guarantees.

EPERM is marked as arm64-specific, since for now arm64 really is
the only architecture that yields this error code for the
finalization-required case.  Keeping this as a distinct error code
is useful however for debugging due to the statefulness of the API
in this instance.

No functional change.
