RDMA/hns: Only assgin some fields if the relatived attr_mask is set

According to IB protocol, some fields of qp context are filled with
optional when the relatived attr_mask are set. The relatived attr_mask
include IB_QP_TIMEOUT, IB_QP_RETRY_CNT, IB_QP_RNR_RETRY and
IB_QP_MIN_RNR_TIMER.  Besides, we move some assignments of the fields of
qp context into the outside of the specific qp state jump function.
