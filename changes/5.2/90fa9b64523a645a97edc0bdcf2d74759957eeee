afs: Fix uninitialised spinlock afs_volume::cb_break_lock

Fix the cb_break_lock spinlock in afs_volume struct by initialising it when
the volume record is allocated.

Also rename the lock to cb_v_break_lock to distinguish it from the lock of
the same name in the afs_server struct.

Without this, the following trace may be observed when a volume-break
callback is received:

  INFO: trying to register non-static key.
  the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
  turning off the locking correctness validator.
