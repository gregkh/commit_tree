ice: update VSI config dynamically

When VSI increases the number of queues dynamically, the scheduler
just needs to add the new required nodes rather than re-adjusting with
previously allocated number of nodes. Readjusting didn't provide enough
parents to add the upper layer nodes also can't place lan and rdma
subtrees separately.

In decrease case, keep the VSI configuration with max number of queues
always. This will leave some extra nodes in the tree but no harm done.
