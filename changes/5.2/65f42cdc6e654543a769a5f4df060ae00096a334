drm/i915: convert the IRQ initialization functions to intel_uncore

The IRQ initialization helpers are simple and self-contained. Continue
the transition started in the recent uncore rework to get us rid of
I915_READ/WRITE and the implicit dev_priv variables.

While the implicit dev_priv is removed from the IRQ initialization
helpers, we didn't get rid of them in the macro callers. Doing that
should be very simple now.

v2: Rebase on top of the new patches.
