i2c: core: add device-managed version of i2c_new_dummy

i2c_new_dummy is typically called from the probe function of the
driver for the primary i2c client. It requires calls to
i2c_unregister_device in the error path of the probe function and
in the remove function.
This can be simplified by introducing a device-managed version.

Note the changed error case return value type: i2c_new_dummy returns
NULL whilst devm_i2c_new_dummy_device returns an ERR_PTR.
