KVM: lapic: Explicitly cancel the hv timer if it's pre-expired

Explicitly call cancel_hv_timer() instead of returning %false to coerce
restart_apic_timer() into canceling it by way of start_sw_timer().

Functionally, the existing code is correct in the sense that it doesn't
doing anything visibily wrong, e.g. generate spurious interrupts or miss
an interrupt.  But it's extremely confusing and inefficient, e.g. there
are multiple extraneous calls to apic_timer_expired() that effectively
get dropped due to @timer_pending being %true.
