net/smc: cleanup of get vlan id

The vlan_id of the underlying CLC socket was retrieved two times
during processing of the listen handshaking. Change this to get the
vlan id one time in connect and in listen processing, and reuse the id.
And add a new CLC DECLINE return code for the case when the retrieval
of the vlan id failed.
