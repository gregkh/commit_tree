drm/i915: Create/destroy VM (ppGTT) for use with contexts

In preparation to making the ppGTT binding for a context explicit (to
facilitate reusing the same ppGTT between different contexts), allow the
user to create and destroy named ppGTT.

v2: Replace global barrier for swapping over the ppgtt and tlbs with a
local context barrier (Tvrtko)
v3: serialise with struct_mutex; it's lazy but required dammit
v4: Rewrite igt_ctx_shared_exec to be more different (aimed to be more
similarly, turned out different!)

v5: Fix up test unwind for aliasing-ppgtt (snb)
v6: Tighten language for uapi struct drm_i915_gem_vm_control.
v7: Patch the context image for runtime ppgtt switching!

Testcase: igt/gem_vm_create
Testcase: igt/gem_ctx_param/vm
Testcase: igt/gem_ctx_clone/vm
Testcase: igt/gem_ctx_shared
