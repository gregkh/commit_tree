ipv6: fix EFAULT on sendto with icmpv6 and hdrincl

The following code returns EFAULT (Bad address):

  s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMPV6);
  setsockopt(s, SOL_IPV6, IPV6_HDRINCL, 1);
  sendto(ipv6_icmp6_packet, addr);   /* returns -1, errno = EFAULT */

The IPv4 equivalent code works. A workaround is to use IPPROTO_RAW
instead of IPPROTO_ICMPV6.

The failure happens because 2 bytes are eaten from the msghdr by
rawv6_probe_proto_opt() starting from commit 19e3c66b52ca ("ipv6
equivalent of "ipv4: Avoid reading user iov twice after
raw_probe_proto_opt""), but at that time it was not a problem because
IPV6_HDRINCL was not yet introduced.

Only eat these 2 bytes if hdrincl == 0.
