drm/msm: dpu: Don't queue the frame_done watchdog for cursor

In the case of an async/cursor update, we don't wait for the frame_done
event, which means handle_frame_done is never called, and the frame_done
watchdog isn't canceled. Currently, this results in a frame_done timeout
every time the cursor moves without a synchronous frame following it up
before the timeout expires. Since we don't wait for frame_done, and
don't handle it, we shouldn't modify the watchdog.
