r8169: fix MAC address being lost in PCI D3

(At least) RTL8168e forgets its MAC address in PCI D3. To fix this set
the MAC address when resuming. For resuming from runtime-suspend we
had this in place already, for resuming from S3/S5 it was missing.

The commit referenced as being fixed isn't wrong, it's just the first
one where the patch applies cleanly.
