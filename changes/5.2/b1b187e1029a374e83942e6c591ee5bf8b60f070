net/mlx5e: Add an underflow warning comment

mlx5e_mpwqe_get_log_rq_size calculates the number of WQEs (N) based on
the requested number of frames in the RQ (F) and the number of packets
per WQE (P). It ensures that N is not less than the minimum number of
WQEs in an RQ (N_min). Arithmetically, it means that F / P >= N_min
should be true. This function deals with logarithms, so it should check
that log(F) - log(P) >= log(N_min). However, if F < P, this expression
will cause an unsigned underflow. Check log(F) >= log(P) + log(N_min)
instead.
