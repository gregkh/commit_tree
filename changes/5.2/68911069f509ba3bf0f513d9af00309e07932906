ktest: Add support for meta characters in GRUB_MENU

ktest fails if meta characters are in GRUB_MENU, for example
GRUB_MENU = 'Fedora (test)'

The failure happens because the meta characters are not escaped,
so the menu doesn't match in any entries in GRUB_FILE.

Use quotemeta() to escape the meta characters.
