cxgb3/l2t: Fix undefined behaviour

The use of zero-sized array causes undefined behaviour when it is not
the last member in a structure. As it happens to be in this case.

Also, the current code makes use of a language extension to the C90
standard, but the preferred mechanism to declare variable-length
types such as this one is a flexible array member, introduced in
C99:

struct foo {
        int stuff;
        struct boo array[];
};

By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
in case the flexible array does not occur last. Which is beneficial
to cultivate a high-quality code.
