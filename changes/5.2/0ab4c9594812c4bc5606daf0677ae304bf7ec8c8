afs: Fix error propagation from server record check/update

afs_check/update_server_record() should be setting fc->error rather than
fc->ac.error as they're called from within the cursor iteration function.

afs_fs_cursor::error is where the error code of the attempt to call the
operation on multiple servers is integrated and is the final result,
whereas afs_addr_cursor::error is used to hold the error from individual
iterations of the call loop.  (Note there's also an afs_vl_cursor which
also wraps afs_addr_cursor for accessing VL servers rather than file
servers).

Fix this by setting fc->error in the afs_check/update_server_record() so
that any error incurred whilst talking to the VL server correctly
propagates to the final result.

This results in:

	kAFS: Unexpected error from FS.StoreData -512

being seen, even though the store-data op is non-interruptible.  The error
is actually coming from the server record update getting interrupted.
