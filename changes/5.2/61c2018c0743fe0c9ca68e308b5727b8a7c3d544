selftests: avoid KBUILD_OUTPUT dir cluttering with selftest objects

Running "make kselftest" or building selftests when KBUILD_OUTPUT
is set, will create selftest objects in the KBUILD_OUTPUT directory.
This could be undesirable especially when user didn't intend to
relocate selftest objects.

Use KBUILD_OUTPUT/kselftest to create selftest objects instead of
cluttering the main directory.
