ice: Implement flow to reset VFs with PFR and other resets

All VF VSIs need to be reset and rebuild with the main VSIs before
replaying all VSIs, so that all existing switch filters, scheduler tree
and other configuration could be replayed at once. This fixes issues when
doing PFR and CORER reset.
