nvme-multipath: avoid crash on invalid subsystem cntlid enumeration

A process holding an open reference to a removed disk prevents it
from completing deletion, so its name continues to exist. A subsequent
gendisk creation may have the same cntlid which risks collision when
using that for the name. Use the unique ctrl->instance instead.
