usb/hcd: Send a uevent signaling that the host controller had died

This change will send an OFFLINE event to udev with the ERROR=DEAD
environment variable set when the HC dies.

By notifying user space the appropriate policies can be applied.
i.e.,
 * Collect error logs.
 * Notify the user that USB is no longer functional.
 * Perform a graceful reboot.
