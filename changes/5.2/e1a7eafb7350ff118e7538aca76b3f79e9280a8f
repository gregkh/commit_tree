efi/arm/arm64: Makefile: Replace -pg with CC_FLAGS_FTRACE

In preparation for arm64 supporting ftrace built on other compiler
options, let's have Makefiles remove the $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE) flags,
whatever these maybe, rather than assuming '-pg'.

While at it, fix arm32 as well. There should be no functional change as
a result of this patch.
