cgroup: Call cgroup_release() before __exit_signal()

cgroup_release() calls cgroup_subsys->release() which is used by the
pids controller to uncharge its pid.  We want to use it to manage
iteration of dying tasks which requires putting it before
__unhash_process().  Move cgroup_release() above __exit_signal().
While this makes it uncharge before the pid is freed, pid is RCU freed
anyway and the window is very narrow.
