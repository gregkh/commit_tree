RDMA/hns: Fix bad endianess of port_pd variable

port_pd is treated as le32 in declaration and read, fix assignment to be
in le32 too. This change fixes the following compilation warnings.

drivers/infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_ah.c:67:24: warning: incorrect type
in assignment (different base types)
drivers/infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_ah.c:67:24: expected restricted __le32 [usertype] port_pd
drivers/infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_ah.c:67:24: got restricted __be32 [usertype]
