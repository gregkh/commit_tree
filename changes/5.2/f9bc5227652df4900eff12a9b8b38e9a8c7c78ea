KVM: nVMX: use correct clean fields when copying from eVMCS

Unfortunately, a couple of mistakes were made while implementing
Enlightened VMCS support, in particular, wrong clean fields were
used in copy_enlightened_to_vmcs12():
- exception_bitmap is covered by CONTROL_EXCPN;
- vm_exit_controls/pin_based_vm_exec_control/secondary_vm_exec_control
  are covered by CONTROL_GRP1.
