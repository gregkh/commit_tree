pmbus: support for custom sysfs attributes

This patch makes it possible to pass custom struct attribute_group array
via the pmbus_driver_info struct so that those can be added to the
attribute groups passed to hwmon_device_register_with_groups().

This makes it possible to register custom sysfs attributes by PMBUS
drivers similar to how you can do this with most other busses/classes.
