ethtool: fix potential userspace buffer overflow

ethtool_get_regs() allocates a buffer of size ops->get_regs_len(),
and pass it to the kernel driver via ops->get_regs() for filling.

There is no restriction about what the kernel drivers can or cannot do
with the open ethtool_regs structure. They usually set regs->version
and ignore regs->len or set it to the same size as ops->get_regs_len().

But if userspace allocates a smaller buffer for the registers dump,
we would cause a userspace buffer overflow in the final copy_to_user()
call, which uses the regs.len value potentially reset by the driver.

To fix this, make this case obvious and store regs.len before calling
ops->get_regs(), to only copy as much data as requested by userspace,
up to the value returned by ops->get_regs_len().

While at it, remove the redundant check for non-null regbuf.
