tools/testing/selftests/sysctl/sysctl.sh: remove superfluous test_reqs()

Patch series "sysctl: add pending proc_do_large_bitmap fix".

Eric sent a fix out for proc_do_large_bitmap() last month for when using
a large input buffer.  After patch review a test case for the issue was
built and submitted.  I noticed there were a few issues with the tests,
but instead of just asking Eric to address them I've taken care of them
and ammended the commit where necessary.  There's a few issues he
reported which I also address and fix in this series.

Since we *do* expect users of these scripts to also use them on older
kernels, I've also addressed not breaking calling the script for them,
and gives us an easy way to easily extend our tests cases for future
kernels as well.

Before anyone considers these for stable as minor fixes, I'd recommend
we also address the discrepancy on the read side of things: modify the
test script to use diff against the target file instead of using the
temp file.

This patch (of 6):

We already call test_reqs(), no need to call it twice.
