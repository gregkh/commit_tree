mm/hmm: add helpers to test if mm is still alive or not

The device driver can have kernel thread or worker doing work against a
process mm and it is useful for those to test wether the mm is dead or
alive to avoid doing useless work.  Add an helper to test that so that
driver can bail out early if a process is dying.

Note that the helper does not perform any lock synchronization and thus is
just a hint ie a process might be dying but the helper might still return
the process as alive.  All HMM functions are safe to use in that case as
HMM internal properly protect itself with lock.  If driver use this helper
with non HMM functions it should ascertain that it is safe to do so.
