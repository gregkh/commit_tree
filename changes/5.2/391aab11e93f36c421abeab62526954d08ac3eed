mm/hmm: convert various hmm_pfn_* to device_entry which is a better name

Convert hmm_pfn_* to device_entry_* as here we are dealing with device
driver specific entry format and hmm provide helpers to allow differents
components (including HMM) to create/parse device entry.

We keep wrapper with the old name so that we can convert driver to use the
new API in stages in each device driver tree.  This will get remove once
all driver are converted.
