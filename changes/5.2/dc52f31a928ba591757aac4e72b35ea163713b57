KVM: arm64: Add missing #include of <linux/string.h> in guest.c

arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c uses the string functions, but the
corresponding header is not included.

We seem to get away with this for now, but for completeness this
patch adds the #include, in preparation for adding yet more
memset() calls.
