ARC: [plat-hsdk]: unify memory apertures configuration

HSDK SoC has memory bridge which allows to configure memory map
for different AXI masters in runtime.
As of today we adjust memory apertures configuration in U-boot
so we have different configuration in case of loading kernel
via U-boot and JTAG.

It isn't really critical in case of existing platform configuration
as configuration differs for <currently> unused address space
regions or unused AXI masters. However we may face with this
issue when we'll bringup new peripherals or touch their address
space.

Fix that by perform full configuration of memory bridge in HSDK
platform code. Basically we simply copy memory bridge configuration
code from U-boot.
