vrf: sit mtu should not be updated when vrf netdev is the link

VRF netdev mtu isn't typically set and have an mtu of 65536. When the
link of a tunnel is set, the tunnel mtu is changed from 1480 to the link
mtu minus tunnel header. In the case of VRF netdev is the link, then the
tunnel mtu becomes 65516. So, fix it by not setting the tunnel mtu in
this case.
