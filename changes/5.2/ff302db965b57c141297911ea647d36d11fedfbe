rhashtable: allow rht_bucket_var to return NULL.

Rather than returning a pointer to a static nulls, rht_bucket_var()
now returns NULL if the bucket doesn't exist.
This will make the next patch, which stores a bitlock in the
bucket pointer, somewhat cleaner.

This change involves introducing __rht_bucket_nested() which is
like rht_bucket_nested(), but doesn't provide the static nulls,
and changing rht_bucket_nested() to call this and possible
provide a static nulls - as is still needed for the non-var case.
