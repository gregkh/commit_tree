arm64: arm_pmu: Remove unnecessary isb instruction

The armv8pmu_enable_event_counter function issues an isb instruction
after enabling a pair of counters - this doesn't provide any value
and is inconsistent with the armv8pmu_disable_event_counter.

In any case armv8pmu_enable_event_counter is always called with the
PMU stopped. Starting the PMU with armv8pmu_start results in an isb
instruction being issued prior to writing to PMCR_EL0.

Let's remove the unnecessary isb instruction.
