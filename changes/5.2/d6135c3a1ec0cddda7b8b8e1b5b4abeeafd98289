nvme-pci: Sync queues on reset

A controller with multiple namespaces may have multiple request_queues with
their own timeout work. If a controller fails with IO outstanding to
diffent namespaces, each request queue may attempt to handle it, so
ensure there is no previously scheduled timeout work executing prior to
starting controller initialization by synchronizing with each queue.
