s390/purgatory: Reduce purgatory size

The purgatory is compiled into the vmlinux and keept in memory all the time
during runtime. Thus any section not needed to load the purgatory
unnecessarily bloats up its foot print in file- and memorysize. Reduce the
purgatory size by stripping the unneeded sections from the purgatory.

This reduces the purgatories size by ~33%.
