mips: Reserve memory for the kernel image resources

The reserved_end variable had been used by the bootmem_init() code
to find a lowest limit of memory available for memmap blob. The original
code just tried to find a free memory space higher than kernel was placed.
This limitation seems justified for the memmap ragion search process, but
I can't see any obvious reason to reserve the unused space below kernel
seeing some platforms place it much higher than standard 1MB. Moreover
the RELOCATION config enables it to be loaded at any memory address.
So lets reserve the memory occupied by the kernel only, leaving the region
below being free for allocations. After doing this we can now discard the
code freeing a space between kernel _text and VMLINUX_LOAD_ADDRESS symbols
since it's going to be free anyway (unless marked as reserved by
platforms).
