bpf: when doing BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN for flow dissector use no-skb mode

Now that we have bpf_flow_dissect which can work on raw data,
use it when doing BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN for flow dissector.

Simplifies bpf_prog_test_run_flow_dissector and allows us to
test no-skb mode.

Note, that previously, with bpf_flow_dissect_skb we used to call
eth_type_trans which pulled L2 (ETH_HLEN) header and we explicitly called
skb_reset_network_header. That means flow_keys->nhoff would be
initialized to 0 (skb_network_offset) in init_flow_keys.
Now we call bpf_flow_dissect with nhoff set to ETH_HLEN and need
to undo it once the dissection is done to preserve the existing behavior.
