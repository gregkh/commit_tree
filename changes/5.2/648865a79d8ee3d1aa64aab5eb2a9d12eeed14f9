dmaengine: axi-dmac: Don't check the number of frames for alignment

In 2D transfers (for the AXI DMAC), the number of frames (numf) represents
Y_LENGTH, and the length of a frame is X_LENGTH. 2D transfers are useful
for video transfers where screen resolutions ( X * Y ) are typically
aligned for X, but not for Y.

There is no requirement for Y_LENGTH to be aligned to the bus-width (or
anything), and this is also true for AXI DMAC.

Checking the Y_LENGTH for alignment causes false errors when initiating DMA
transfers. This change fixes this by checking only that the Y_LENGTH is
non-zero.
