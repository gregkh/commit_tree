drm/amd/display: Update VRR state earlier in atomic_commit_tail.

We need the VRR active/inactive state info earlier in
the commit sequence, so VRR related setup functions like
amdgpu_dm_handle_vrr_transition() know the final VRR state
when they need to do their hw setup work.

Split update_freesync_state_on_stream() into an early part,
that can run at the beginning of commit tail before the
vrr transition handling, and a late part that must run after
vrr transition handling inside the commit planes code for
enabled crtc's.
