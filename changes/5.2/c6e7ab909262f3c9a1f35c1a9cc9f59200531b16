mmc: tegra: add Tegra186 WAR for CQE

Tegra186 CQHCI host has a known bug where CQHCI controller selects
DATA_PRESENT_SELECT bit to 1 for DCMDs with R1B response type and
since DCMD does not trigger any data transfer, DCMD task complete
happens leaving the DATA FSM of host controller in wait state for
the data.

This effects the data transfer tasks issued after the DCMDs with
R1b response type resulting in timeout.

SW WAR is to set CMD_TIMING to 1 in DCMD task descriptor. This bug
and SW WAR is applicable only for Tegra186 and not for Tegra194.

This patch implements this WAR thru NVQUIRK_CQHCI_DCMD_R1B_CMD_TIMING
for Tegra186 and also implements update_dcmd_desc of cqhci_host_ops
interface to set CMD_TIMING bit depending on the NVQUIRK.
