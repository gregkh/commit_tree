net: dsa: Add helper function to retrieve VLAN awareness setting

Since different types of hardware may or may not support this setting
per-port, DSA keeps it either in dsa_switch or in dsa_port.

While drivers may know the characteristics of their hardware and
retrieve it from the correct place without the need of helpers, it is
cumbersone to find out an unambigous answer from generic DSA code.
