s390/kprobes: use static buffer for insn_page

With a relocatable kernel that could reside at any place in memory, the
current logic for allocating a kprobes insn_page does not work. The
GFP_DMA allocated buffer might be more than 2 GB away from the kernel.

Use a static buffer for the insn_page instead.
