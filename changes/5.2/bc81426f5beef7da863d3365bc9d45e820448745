prctl_set_mm: downgrade mmap_sem to read lock

The commit a3b609ef9f8b ("proc read mm's {arg,env}_{start,end} with mmap
semaphore taken.") added synchronization of reading argument/environment
boundaries under mmap_sem.  Later commit 88aa7cc688d4 ("mm: introduce
arg_lock to protect arg_start|end and env_start|end in mm_struct") avoided
the coarse use of mmap_sem in similar situations.  But there still
remained two places that (mis)use mmap_sem.

get_cmdline should also use arg_lock instead of mmap_sem when it reads the
boundaries.

The second place that should use arg_lock is in prctl_set_mm.  By
protecting the boundaries fields with the arg_lock, we can downgrade
mmap_sem to reader lock (analogous to what we already do in
prctl_set_mm_map).
