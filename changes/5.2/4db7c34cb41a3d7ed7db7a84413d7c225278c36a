cpufreq: Move ->get callback check outside of __cpufreq_get()

Currenly, __cpufreq_get() called by show_cpuinfo_cur_freq() will check
->get callback. That is needless since cpuinfo_cur_freq attribute will
not be created if ->get is not set. So let's drop it in __cpufreq_get().
Also keep this check in cpufreq_get().
