ASoC: wm_adsp: Avoid calling snd_compr_stop_error from WDT expiry

It is unsafe to call snd_compr_stop_error from outside of the
compressed ops. Firstly the compressed device lock needs to be held
and secondly it queues error work to issue a trigger stop which
should not happen after the stream has been freed. To avoid these
issues use the same trick used for the IRQ handling, simply send a
snd_compr_fragment_elapsed to cause user-space to wake on the poll,
then report the error when user-space issues the pointer request
after it wakes.
