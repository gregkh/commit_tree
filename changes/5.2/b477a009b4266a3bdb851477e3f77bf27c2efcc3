drm/omap: panel-tpo-td028ttec1: add backlight support

This panel has a backlight, so fetch it from devicetree using the
corresponding property as documented in panel-common.txt. It is
implemented the same way as in panel-dpi.c
This ensures the backlight is also disabled when the display is
turned off like when doing xset dpms force off.
