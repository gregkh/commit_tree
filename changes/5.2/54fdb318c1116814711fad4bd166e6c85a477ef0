rsi: add new device model for 9116

9116 device id entry is added in both SDIO and USB interfaces.
New enumberation value taken for the device model. Based on the
device model detected run time, few device specific operations
needs to be performed.

adding rsi_dev_model to get device type in run time, as we can use
same driver for 9113 and 9116 except few firmware load changes.
