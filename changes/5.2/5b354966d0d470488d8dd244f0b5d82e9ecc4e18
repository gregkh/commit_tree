drm/i915/ehl: inherit icl cdclk init/uninit

The cdclk init/uninit code was changed by commit 93a643f29bcb
("drm/i915/cdclk: have only one init/uninit function") between the
versions of commit 39564ae86d51 ("drm/i915/ehl: Inherit Ice Lake
conditional code"). What got merged fails to do cdclk init/uninit on
ehl.

Fixes: 39564ae86d51 ("drm/i915/ehl: Inherit Ice Lake conditional code")
