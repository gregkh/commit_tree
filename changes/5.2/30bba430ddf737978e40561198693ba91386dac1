dm integrity: correctly calculate the size of metadata area

When we use separate devices for data and metadata, dm-integrity would
incorrectly calculate the size of the metadata device as if it had
512-byte block size - and it would refuse activation with larger block
size and smaller metadata device.

Fix this so that it takes actual block size into account, which fixes
the following reported issue:
