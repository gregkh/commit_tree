arm64: mm: fix incorrect assignment of 'max_mapnr'

Although we don't actually make use of the 'max_mapnr' global variable,
we do set it to a junk value for !CONFIG_FLATMEM configurations that
leave mem_map uninitialised.

To avoid somebody tripping over this in future, set 'max_mapnr' using
max_pfn, which is calculated directly from the memblock information.
