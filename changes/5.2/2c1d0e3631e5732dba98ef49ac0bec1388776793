ext4: avoid panic during forced reboot due to aborted journal

Handling of aborted journal is a special code path different from
standard ext4_error() one and it can call panic() as well. Commit
1dc1097ff60e ("ext4: avoid panic during forced reboot") forgot to update
this path so fix that omission.
