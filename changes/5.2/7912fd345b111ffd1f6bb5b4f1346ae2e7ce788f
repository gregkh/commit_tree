staging: kpc2000_spi: eliminated duplicate initialization of drvdata local variable.

drvdata was being initialized to a particular value and then
having the same value assigned to it immediately afterwards.  Removed
the initializer.

Since the value assigned, pldev->dev.platform_data, is a pointer-to-
void, removed superfluous cast.
