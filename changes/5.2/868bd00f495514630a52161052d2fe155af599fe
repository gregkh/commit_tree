ASoC: SOF: Add PCM operations support

Add support for exposing PCMs to userspace. PCMs are defined by topology
and the operations in this patch map to SOF IPC calls.

The .get_module_upon_open field is set to allow for module load/unload
tests. There is no risk of the sof-pci/acpi-dev module being removed
while the platform components are in use. This may need to be
revisited when DT platforms are supported.
