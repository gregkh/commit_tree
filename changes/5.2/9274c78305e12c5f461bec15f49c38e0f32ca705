power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Add ACEPC T8 and T11 mini PCs to the blacklist

The ACEPC T8 and T11 Cherry Trail Z8350 mini PCs use an AXP288 and as PCs,
rather then portables, they does not have a battery. Still for some
reason the AXP288 not only thinks there is a battery, it actually
thinks it is discharging while the PC is running, slowly going to
0% full, causing userspace to shutdown the system due to the battery
being critically low after a while.

This commit adds the ACEPC T8 and T11 to the axp288 fuel-gauge driver
blacklist, so that we stop reporting bogus battery readings on this device.
