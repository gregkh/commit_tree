dns_resolver: Allow used keys to be invalidated

Allow used DNS resolver keys to be invalidated after use if the caller is
doing its own caching of the results.  This reduces the amount of resources
required.

Fix AFS to invalidate DNS results to kill off permanent failure records
that get lodged in the resolver keyring and prevent future lookups from
happening.
