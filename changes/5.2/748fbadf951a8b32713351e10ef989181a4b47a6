spi: pxa2xx: Unify remaing prints in pxa2xx_spi_transfer_one()

Use SPI device pointer in the remaining two error and warning prints in
pxa2xx_spi_transfer_one() instead of platform device of the controller

It make prints in the function uniform and more useful especially the
error print here as it can reveal the driver that has mapped the DMA
itself and attempts to transfer more than the maximum supported DMA
transfer length.
