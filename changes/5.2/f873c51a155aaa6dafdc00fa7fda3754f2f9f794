PCI/ACPI: Implement _HPX Type 3 Setting Record

The _HPX Type 3 Setting Record is intended to be more generic and allow
configuration of settings not possible with Type 2 records.  For example,
firmware could ensure that the completion timeout value is set accordingly
throughout the PCI tree.

Implement support for _HPX Type 3 Setting Records, which were added in the
ACPI 6.3 spec.
