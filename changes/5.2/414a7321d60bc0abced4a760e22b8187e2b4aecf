ASoC: da7213: fix DAI_CLK_EN register bit overwrite

If the da7213 codec is configured as Master with the DAPM power down
delay time set, 'snd_soc_component_write' function overwrites the
DAI_CLK_EN bit of DAI_CLK_MODE register which leads to audio play
only once until it re-initialize after codec power up.
