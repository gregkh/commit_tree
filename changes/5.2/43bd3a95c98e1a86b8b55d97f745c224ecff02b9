kbuild: use -flive-patching when CONFIG_LIVEPATCH is enabled

GCC 9 introduces a new option, -flive-patching. It disables certain
optimizations which could make a compilation unsafe for later live
patching of the running kernel.

The option is used only if CONFIG_LIVEPATCH is enabled and $(CC)
supports it.

Performance impact of the option was measured on three different
Intel machines - two bigger NUMA boxes and one smaller UMA box. Kernel
intensive (IO, scheduling, networking) benchmarks were selected, plus a
set of HPC workloads from NAS Parallel Benchmark. The tests were done on
upstream kernel 5.0-rc8 with openSUSE Leap 15.0 userspace.

The majority of the tests is unaffected. The only significant exception
is the scheduler section which suffers 1-3% degradation.
