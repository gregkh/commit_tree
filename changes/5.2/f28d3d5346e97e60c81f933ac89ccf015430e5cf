timer/trace: Improve timer tracing

Timers are added to the timer wheel off by one. This is required in
case a timer is queued directly before incrementing jiffies to prevent
early timer expiry.

When reading a timer trace and relying only on the expiry time of the timer
in the timer_start trace point and on the now in the timer_expiry_entry
trace point, it seems that the timer fires late. With the current
timer_expiry_entry trace point information only now=jiffies is printed but
not the value of base->clk. This makes it impossible to draw a conclusion
to the index of base->clk and makes it impossible to examine timer problems
without additional trace points.

Therefore add the base->clk value to the timer_expire_entry trace
point, to be able to calculate the index the timer base is located at
during collecting expired timers.
