drm/i915: Remove last traces of exec-id (GEM_BUSY)

As we allow per-context engine allows the legacy concept of
I915_EXEC_RING no longer applies universally. We are still exposing the
unrelated exec-id in GEM_BUSY, so transition this ioctl (once more
slightly changing its ABI, but no one cares) over to only reporting the
uabi-class (not instance as we can not foreseeably fit those into the
small bitmask).

The only user of the extended ring information from GEM_BUSY is ddx/sna,
which tries to use the non-rcs business information to guide which
engine to use for subsequent operations on foreign bo. All that matters
for it is the decision between rcs and !rcs, so it is unaffected by the
change in higher bits.
