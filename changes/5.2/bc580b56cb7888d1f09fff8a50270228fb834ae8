iommu/arm-smmu: Log CBFRSYNRA register on context fault

Bits[15:0] in CBFRSYNRA register contain information about
StreamID of the incoming transaction that generated the
fault. Dump CBFRSYNRA register to get this info.
This is specially useful in a distributed SMMU architecture
where multiple masters are connected to the SMMU.
SID information helps to quickly identify the faulting
master device.
