clocksource/drivers/sun4i: Add a compatible for suniv

The suniv (new F-series) chip has a timer with less functionality than
the A10 timer, e.g. it has only 3 channels.

Add a new compatible for it. As we didn't use the extra channels on A10
either now, the code needn't to be changed.

The suniv chip is based on ARM926EJ-S CPU, thus it has no architecture timer.

Register sun4i_timer as sched_clock on it.
