mm: memcontrol: track LRU counts in the vmstats array

Patch series "mm: memcontrol: clean up the LRU counts tracking".

The memcg LRU stats usage is currently a bit messy.  Memcg has private
per-zone counters because reclaim needs zone granularity sometimes, but we
also have plenty of users that need to awkwardly sum them up to node or
memcg granularity.  Meanwhile the canonical per-memcg vmstats do not track
the LRU counts (NR_INACTIVE_ANON etc.) as you'd expect.

This series enables LRU count tracking in the per-memcg vmstats array such
that lruvec_page_state() and memcg_page_state() work on the enum
node_stat_item items for the LRU counters.  Then it converts all the
callers that don't specifically need per-zone numbers over to that.

This patch (of 6):

The memcg code currently maintains private per-zone breakdowns of the LRU
counters.  This is necessary for reclaim decisions which are still
zone-based, but there are a variety of users of these counters that only
want the aggregate per-lruvec or per-memcg LRU counts, and they need to
painfully sum up the zone counters on each request for that.

These would be better served using the memcg vmstats arrays, which track
VM statistics at the desired scope already.  They just don't have the LRU
counts right now.

So to kick off the conversion, begin tracking LRU counts in those.
