ALSA: hda/realtek - Support low power consumption for ALC256

Remove hp_pin = 0 return. Add the default pin 0x21 as headphone.
Supported low power consumption, it must do depop procedure when
headset jack was plugged or unplugged.
So, alc256_init() and alc256_shutup() must run delay when headset jack
was plugged or unplugged.
If depop procedure not run with delay, it will have a chance to let
power consumption raise high.

[ NOTE: this is a quite quite similar change for ALC295 by commit
  d3ba58bb8959 ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Support low power consumption for
  ALC295"), but applied to ALC256 codec instead -- tiwai ]
