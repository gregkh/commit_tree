bpftool: Use print_entry_error() in case of ENOENT when dumping

Commit bf598a8f0f77 ("bpftool: Improve handling of ENOENT on map dumps")
used print_entry_plain() in case of ENOENT. However, that commit introduces
dead code. Per-cpu maps are zero-filled. When reading them, it's all or
nothing. There will never be a case where some cpus have an entry and
others don't.

The truth is that ENOENT is an error case. Use print_entry_error() to
output the desired message. That function's "value" parameter is also
renamed to indicate that we never use it for an actual map value.

The output format is unchanged.
