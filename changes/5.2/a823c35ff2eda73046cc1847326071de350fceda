arm64: ptrace: Add function argument access API

Add regs_get_argument() which returns N th argument of the function
call. On arm64, it supports up to 8th argument.
Note that this chooses most probably assignment, in some case
it can be incorrect (e.g. passing data structure or floating
point etc.)

This enables ftrace kprobe events to access kernel function
arguments via $argN syntax.
