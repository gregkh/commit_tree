habanalabs: Manipulate DMA addresses in ASIC functions

Routing device accesses to the host memory requires the usage of a base
offset, which is canceled by the iATU just before leaving the device.
The value of the base offset might be distinctive between different ASIC
types.
The manipulation of the addresses is currently used throughout the
driver code, and one should be aware to it whenever providing a host
memory address to the device.
This patch removes this manipulation from the driver common code, and
moves it to the ASIC specific functions that are responsible for
host memory allocation/mapping.
