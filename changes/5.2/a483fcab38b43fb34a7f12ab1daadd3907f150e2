efi/bgrt: Drop BGRT status field reserved bits check

Starting with ACPI 6.2 bits 1 and 2 of the BGRT status field are no longer
reserved. These bits are now used to indicate if the image needs to be
rotated before being displayed.

The first device using these bits has now shown up (the GPD MicroPC) and
the reserved bits check causes us to reject the valid BGRT table on this
device.

Rather then changing the reserved bits check, allowing only the 2 new bits,
instead just completely remove it so that we do not end up with a similar
problem when more bits are added in the future.
