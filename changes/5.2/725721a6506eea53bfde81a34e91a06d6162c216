bpf: allow clearing all sock_ops callback flags

The helper function bpf_sock_ops_cb_flags_set() can be used to both
set and clear the sock_ops callback flags. However, its current
behavior is not consistent. BPF program may clear a flag if more than
one were set, or replace a flag with another one, but cannot clear all
flags.

This patch also updates the documentation to clarify the ability to
clear flags of this helper function.
