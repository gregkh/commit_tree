phy: mapphone-mdm6600: add gpiolib dependency

gcc points out that when CONFIG_GPIOLIB is disabled,
gpiod_get_array_value_cansleep() returns 0 but fails to set its output:

drivers/phy/motorola/phy-mapphone-mdm6600.c: In function 'phy_mdm6600_status':
drivers/phy/motorola/phy-mapphone-mdm6600.c:220:24: error: 'values[0]' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]

This could be fixed more generally in gpiolib by returning a failure
code, but for this specific case, the easier workaround is to add a
gpiolib dependency.
