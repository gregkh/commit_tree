futex: Update comments and docs about return values of arch futex code

The architecture implementations of 'arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser()' and
'futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic()' are permitted to return only -EFAULT,
-EAGAIN or -ENOSYS in the case of failure.

Update the comments in the asm-generic/ implementation and also a stray
reference in the robust futex documentation.
