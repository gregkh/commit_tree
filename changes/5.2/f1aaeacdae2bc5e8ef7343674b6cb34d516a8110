mlxsw: spectrum_buffers: Forbid changing multicast TCs' attributes

Commit e83c045e53d7 ("mlxsw: spectrum_buffers: Configure MC pool")
configured the threshold of the multicast TCs as infinite so that the
admission of multicast packets is only depended on per-switch priority
threshold.

Forbid the user from changing the thresholds of these multicast TCs and
their binding to a different pool.
