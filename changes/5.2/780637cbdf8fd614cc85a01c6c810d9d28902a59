drm/amdgpu: let amdgpu_vm_clear_bo figure out ats status v2

Instead of providing it from outside figure out the ats status in the
function itself from the data structures.

v2: simplify finding the right level
v3: partially revert changes from v2, more cleanup and split code
    into more functions.
