perf list: Output tool events

Add support in 'perf list' to output tool internal events, currently
only 'duration_time'.

Committer testing:

  $ perf list dur*

  List of pre-defined events (to be used in -e):

    duration_time                                      [Tool event]

  Metric Groups:

  $ perf list sw

  List of pre-defined events (to be used in -e):
