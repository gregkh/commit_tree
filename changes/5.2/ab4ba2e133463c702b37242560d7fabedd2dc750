btrfs: tree-checker: Verify dev item

[BUG]
For fuzzed image whose DEV_ITEM has invalid total_bytes as 0, then
kernel will just panic:
  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000098
  #PF error: [normal kernel read fault]
  PGD 800000022b2bd067 P4D 800000022b2bd067 PUD 22b2bc067 PMD 0
  Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
  CPU: 0 PID: 1106 Comm: mount Not tainted 5.0.0-rc8+ #9
  RIP: 0010:btrfs_verify_dev_extents+0x2a5/0x5a0
  Call Trace:
   open_ctree+0x160d/0x2149
   btrfs_mount_root+0x5b2/0x680

[CAUSE]
If device extent verification finds a deivce with 0 total_bytes, then it
assumes it's a seed dummy, then search for seed devices.

But in this case, there is no seed device at all, causing NULL pointer.

[FIX]
Since this is caused by fuzzed image, let's go the tree-check way, just
add a new verification for device item.
