block: loop: mark bvec as ITER_BVEC_FLAG_NO_REF

loop is one block device, for any bio submitted to this device,
the upper layer does guarantee that pages added to loop's bio won't
go away when the bio is in-flight.

So mark loop's bvec as ITER_BVEC_FLAG_NO_REF then get_page/put_page
can be saved for serving loop's IO.
