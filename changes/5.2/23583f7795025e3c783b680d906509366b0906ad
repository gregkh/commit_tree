ACPI / property: fix handling of data_nodes in acpi_get_next_subnode()

When the DSDT tables expose devices with subdevices and a set of
hierarchical _DSD properties, the data returned by
acpi_get_next_subnode() is incorrect, with the results suggesting a bad
pointer assignment. The parser works fine with device_nodes or
data_nodes, but not with a combination of the two.

The problem is traced to an invalid pointer used when jumping from
handling device_nodes to data nodes. The existing code looks for data
nodes below the last subdevice found instead of the common root. Fix
by forcing the acpi_device pointer to be derived from the same fwnode
for the two types of subnodes.

This same problem of handling device and data nodes was already fixed
in a similar way by 'commit bf4703fdd166 ("ACPI / property: fix data
node parsing in acpi_get_next_subnode()")' but broken later by 'commit
34055190b19 ("ACPI / property: Add fwnode_get_next_child_node()")', so
this should probably go to linux-stable all the way to 4.12
