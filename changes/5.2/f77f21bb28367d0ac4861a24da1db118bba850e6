ceph: use __getname/__putname in ceph_mdsc_build_path

Al suggested we get rid of the kmalloc here and just use __getname
and __putname to get a full PATH_MAX pathname buffer.

Since we build the path in reverse, we continue to return a pointer
to the beginning of the string and the length, and add a new helper
to free the thing at the end.
