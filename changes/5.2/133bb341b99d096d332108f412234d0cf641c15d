dt-bindings: clock: g12a-aoclk: expose CLKID_AO_CTS_OSCIN

When submitted v2 of the G12A AO-CLK IDs, the CLKID_AO_CTS_OSCIN was moved
to the internal non-exported bindings, but this clock is necessary for
the second AO-CEC-B module since it embeds the 32768Hz dual-divider
clock generator unlike the AO-CEC-A module.

Export it back to the public bindings.
