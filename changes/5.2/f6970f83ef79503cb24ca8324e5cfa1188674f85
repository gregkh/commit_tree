block: don't check if adjacent bvecs in one bio can be mergeable

Now both passthrough and FS IO have supported multi-page bvec, and
bvec merging has been handled actually when adding page to bio, then
adjacent bvecs won't be mergeable any more if they belong to same bio.

So only try to merge bvecs if they are from different bios.
