afs: switch to use of ->free_inode()

debugging printks left in ->destroy_inode() and so's the
update of inode count; we could take the latter to RCU-delayed
part (would take only moving the check on module exit past
rcu_barrier() there), but debugging output ought to either
stay where it is or go into ->evict_inode()
