smpboot: Place the __percpu annotation correctly

The test robot reported a wrong assignment of a per-CPU variable which
it detected by using sparse and sent a report. The assignment itself is
correct. The annotation for sparse was wrong and hence the report.
The first pointer is a "normal" pointer and points to the per-CPU memory
area. That means that the __percpu annotation has to be moved.

Move the __percpu annotation to pointer which points to the per-CPU
area. This change affects only the sparse tool (and is ignored by the
compiler).
