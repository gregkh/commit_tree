staging: comedi: dt9812: Call mutex_destroy() on private mutex

`dt9812_detach()` is the Comedi "detach" handler for the dt9812 driver.
When it is called, the private data for the device is about to be freed.
The private data contains a mutex `devpriv->mut` that was initialized
when the private data was allocated.  Call `mutex_destroy()` to mark it
as invalid.

Also remove the calls to `mutex_lock()` and `mutex_unlock()` from
`dt9812_detach()` as the mutex is only being used around a call to
`usb_set_intfdata()` to clear the USB interface's driver data pointer.
The mutex lock seems redundant here, especially as it is about to be
destroyed.
