usb: gadget: atmel: tie wake lock to running clock

If the USB device is connected to a host, the CPU cannot be suspended or
else the USB device appears to be disconnected from the host's point of
view.  Only after a "USB suspend" state has been entered (as set by the
host) or the host is disconnected can the system safely be suspended: in
both these states, the clock is stopped.  As such, this patch associates
a "wake lock" with the running clock of the UDC to keep the system awake
as long as the host maintains the USB connection active.
