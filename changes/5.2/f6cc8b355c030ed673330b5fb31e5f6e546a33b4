watchdog: i6300esb: stop printing kernel addresses

Since commit ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p"),
i6300esb prints "____ptrval____" instead of actual addresses:

    i6300ESB timer 0000:00:03.0: initialized (0x(____ptrval____)). heartbeat=30 sec (nowayout=1)

Instead of changing the print to "%px", and leaking kernel addresses,
just remove the print completely, cfr. e.g. commit 071929dbdd865f77
("arm64: Stop printing the virtual memory layout").
