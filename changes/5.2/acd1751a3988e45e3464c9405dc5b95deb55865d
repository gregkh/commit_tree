ice: Remove unnecessary wait when disabling/enabling Rx queues

In ice_vsi_ctrl_rx_rings() we are unnecessarily waiting for
QRX_CTRL_QENA_REQ and QRX_CTRL_QENA_STAT to be the same value prior to
disabling each Rx queue. There is no reason to do this so remove
this wait loop as we already have a wait loop after disabling/enabling
the Rx queue through the QRX_CTRL register to make sure it gets
successfully disabled/enabled.
