dma-buf: add new dma_fence_chain container v7

Lockless container implementation similar to a dma_fence_array, but with
only two elements per node and automatic garbage collection.

v2: properly document dma_fence_chain_for_each, add dma_fence_chain_find_seqno,
    drop prev reference during garbage collection if it's not a chain fence.
v3: use head and iterator for dma_fence_chain_for_each
v4: fix reference count in dma_fence_chain_enable_signaling
v5: fix iteration when walking each chain node
v6: add __rcu for member 'prev' of struct chain node
v7: fix rcu warnings from kernel robot
