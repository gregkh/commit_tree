net: sched: add empty status flag for NOLOCK qdisc

The queue is marked not empty after acquiring the seqlock,
and it's up to the NOLOCK qdisc clearing such flag on dequeue.
Since the empty status lays on the same cache-line of the
seqlock, it's always hot on cache during the updates.

This makes the empty flag update a little bit loosy. Given
the lack of synchronization between enqueue and dequeue, this
is unavoidable.

v2 -> v3:
 - qdisc_is_empty() has a const argument (Eric)

v1 -> v2:
 - use really an 'empty' flag instead of 'not_empty', as
   suggested by Eric
