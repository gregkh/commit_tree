drm/sun4i: Fix sun8i HDMI PHY clock initialization

Current code initializes HDMI PHY clock driver before reset line is
deasserted and clocks enabled. Because of that, initial readout of
clock divider is incorrect (0 instead of 2). This causes any clock
rate with divider 1 (register value 0) to be set incorrectly.

Fix this by moving initialization of HDMI PHY clock driver after reset
line is deasserted and clocks enabled.
