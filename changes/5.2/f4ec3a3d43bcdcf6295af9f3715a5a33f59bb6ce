switch fsnotify_move() to passing const struct qstr * for old_name

note that in the second (RENAME_EXCHANGE) call of fsnotify_move() in
vfs_rename() the old_dentry->d_name is guaranteed to be unchanged
throughout the evaluation of fsnotify_move() (by the fact that the
parent directory is locked exclusive), so we don't need to fetch
old_dentry->d_name.name in the caller.
