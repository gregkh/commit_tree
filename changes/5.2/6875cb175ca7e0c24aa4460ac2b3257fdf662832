RDMA/core: Clear out the udata before error unwind

The core code should not pass a udata to the driver destroy function that
contains the input from the create command. Otherwise the driver will
attempt to interpret the create udata as destroy udata, and at least in
the case of EFA, will leak resources.

Zero this stuff out before invoking destroy.
