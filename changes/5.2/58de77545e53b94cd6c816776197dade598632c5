riscv: move flush_icache_{all,mm} to cacheflush.c

Currently, flush_icache_all is macro-expanded into a SBI call, yet no
asm/sbi.h is included in asm/cacheflush.h. This could be moved to
mm/cacheflush.c instead (SBI call will dominate performance-wise and
there is no worry to not have it inlined.

Currently, flush_icache_mm stays in kernel/smp.c, which looks like a
hack to prevent it from being compiled when CONFIG_SMP=n. It should
also be in mm/cacheflush.c.
