thunderbolt: Add functions for allocating and releasing HopIDs

Each port has a separate path configuration space that is used for
finding the next hop (switch) in the path. HopID is an index to this
configuration space. HopIDs 0 - 7 are reserved by the protocol.

In order to get next available HopID for each direction we provide two
pairs of helper functions that can be used to allocate and release
HopIDs for a given port.

While there remove obsolete TODO comment.
