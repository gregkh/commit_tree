perf scripts python: exported-sql-viewer.py: Move view creation

As preparation for adding support for copying to clipboard, create view
in TreeWindowBase instead of derived classes.

Committer testing:

Tested using an old .db used to test some older patches:

  $ python ~acme/libexec/perf-core/scripts/python/exported-sql-viewer.py ~/c/adrian.hunter/simple-retpoline.db

Nothing breaks.
