phy: ti-pipe3: improve DPLL stability for SATA & USB

For increased DPLL stability use the settings recommended in
the TRM [1] for PHY_RX registers for SATA and USB.

For SATA we need to use spread spectrum settings even
though we don't have spread spectrum enabled. The
suggested non-spread spectrum settings don't work.
