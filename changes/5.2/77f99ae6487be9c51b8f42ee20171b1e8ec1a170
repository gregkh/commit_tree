iwlwifi: dbg_ini: support notification and dhc regions type parsing

IWL_FW_INI_REGION_CSR and IWL_FW_INI_REGION_NOTIFICATION does not have
memory addresses attached to them so the driver should skip them when
parsing the region tlv.
Also, instead of declearing what region types should skip the addition of
the memory addresses, declare what regions have addition of memory
addresses.
