net: dsa: sja1105: Add support for VLAN operations

VLAN filtering cannot be properly disabled in SJA1105. So in order to
emulate the "no VLAN awareness" behavior (not dropping traffic that is
tagged with a VID that isn't configured on the port), we need to hack
another switch feature: programmable TPID (which is 0x8100 for 802.1Q).
We are reprogramming the TPID to a bogus value which leaves the switch
thinking that all traffic is untagged, and therefore accepts it.

Under a vlan_filtering bridge, the proper TPID of ETH_P_8021Q is
installed again, and the switch starts identifying 802.1Q-tagged
traffic.
