tracing: Use tracing error_log with trace event filters

Use tracing_log_err() from the new tracing error_log mechanism to send
filter parse errors to tracing/error_log.

With this change, users will be able to see filter errors by looking
at tracing/error_log.

The same errors will also be available in the filter file, as
expected.
