habanalabs: increase timeout if working with simulator

Where there is a spike in the CPU consumption, it may cause
random failures in the C/I since the KMD timeout for CPU
and/or QMAN0 jobs expires and it stops communicating to the simulator.
This commit fixes it by increasing timeout on polling functions
if working with simulator.
