ASoC: wm_adsp: Add support for new Halo core DSPs

The Halo core is a new generation of audio DSP architecture from
Cirrus Logic. A new iteration of the WMFW file format (v3) is also
added, for this new architecture. Currently this format is not
supported on the old ADSP2 architecture however support may be
added for it in the future.
