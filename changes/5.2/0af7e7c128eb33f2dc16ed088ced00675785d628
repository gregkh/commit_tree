ipv4: Update fib_table_lookup tracepoint to take common nexthop

Update fib_table_lookup tracepoint to take a fib_nh_common struct and
dump the v6 gateway address if the nexthop uses it.

Over the years saddr has not proven useful and the output of the
tracepoint produces very long lines. Since saddr is not part of
fib_nh_common, drop it. If it needs to be added later, fib_nh which
contains saddr can be obtained from a fib_nh_common via container_of.
