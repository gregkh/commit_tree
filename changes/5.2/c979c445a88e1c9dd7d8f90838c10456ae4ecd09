net/mlx5e: Additional check for flow destination comparison

Flow destination comparison has an inaccuracy: code see no
difference between same vf ports, which belong to different pfs.

Example: If start ping from VF0 (PF1) to VF1 (PF1) and mirror
all traffic to VF0 (PF2), icmp reply to VF0 (PF1) and mirrored
flow to VF0 (PF2) would be determined as same destination. It lead
to creating flow handler with rule nodes, which not added to node
tree. When later driver try to delete this flow rules we got
kernel crash.

Add comparison of vhca_id field to avoid this.
