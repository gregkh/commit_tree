net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: don't use PHY_DETECT on internal PHY's

mv88e6xxx_port_ppu_updates() interpretes data in the PORT_STS
register incorrectly for internal ports (ie no PPU). In these
cases, the PHY_DETECT bit indicates link status. This results
in forcing the MAC state whenever the PHY link goes down which
is not intended. As a side effect, LED's configured to show
link status stay lit even though the physical link is down.

Add a check in mac_link_down and mac_link_up to see if it
concerns an external port and only then, look at PPU status.
