iio: light: tcs3414: convert probe to device-managed routines

This change converts the driver to use only device-managed init routines in
the probe function of the driver.

This way, we no longer need the tcs3414_remove() hook.
We still need to keep the i2c_set_clientdata() call, as that's being used
for the PM routines.

And lastly, a devm_add_action_or_reset() hook is added to call the
powerdown handler when the chip is uninitialized or the probe fails.
