mlxsw: pci: Recycle received packet upon allocation failure

When the driver fails to allocate a new Rx buffer, it passes an empty Rx
descriptor (contains zero address and size) to the device and marks it
as invalid by setting the skb pointer in the descriptor's metadata to
NULL.

After processing enough Rx descriptors, the driver will try to process
the invalid descriptor, but will return immediately seeing that the skb
pointer is NULL. Since the driver no longer passes new Rx descriptors to
the device, the Rx queue will eventually become full and the device will
start to drop packets.

Fix this by recycling the received packet if allocation of the new
packet failed. This means that allocation is no longer performed at the
end of the Rx routine, but at the start, before tearing down the DMA
mapping of the received packet.

Remove the comment about the descriptor being zeroed as it is no longer
correct. This is OK because we either use the descriptor as-is (when
recycling) or overwrite its address and size fields with that of the
newly allocated Rx buffer.

The issue was discovered when a process ("perf") consumed too much
memory and put the system under memory pressure. It can be reproduced by
injecting slab allocation failures [1]. After the fix, the Rx queue no
longer comes to a halt.
