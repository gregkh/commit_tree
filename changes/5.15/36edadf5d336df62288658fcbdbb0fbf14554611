mfd: intel_quark_i2c_gpio: Convert GPIO to use software nodes

The driver can provide a software node group instead of
passing legacy platform data. This will allow to drop
the legacy platform data structures along with unifying
a child device driver to use same interface for all
property providers, i.e. Device Tree, ACPI, and board files.
