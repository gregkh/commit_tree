ASoC: DAPM: Fix missing kctl change notifications

The put callback of a kcontrol is supposed to return 1 when the value
is changed, and this will be notified to user-space.  However, some
DAPM kcontrols always return 0 (except for errors), hence the
user-space misses the update of a control value.

This patch corrects the behavior by properly returning 1 when the
value gets updated.
