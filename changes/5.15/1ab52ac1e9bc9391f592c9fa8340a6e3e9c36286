RDMA/mlx5: Set user priority for DCT

Currently, the driver doesn't set the PCP-based priority for DCT, hence
DCT response packets are transmitted without user priority.

Fix it by setting user provided priority in the eth_prio field in the DCT
context, which in turn sets the value in the transmitted packet.
