drm/amd/display: Fix prefetch bandwidth calculation for DCN3.1

[Why]
Prefetch BW calculated is lower than the DML reference because of a
porting error that's excluding cursor and row bandwidth from the
pixel data bandwidth.

[How]
Change the dml_max4 to dml_max3 and include cursor and row bandwidth
in the same calculation as the rest of the pixel data during vactive.
