media: imx: imx7_mipi_csis: convert some switch cases to the default

Static analysis reports this false positive
imx7-mipi-csis.c:1027:2: warning: 4th function call argument is
  an uninitialized value

The variable 'align' is falsely reported as uninitialized.
Even though all the cases are covered in the
	switch (csis_fmt->width % 8) {

Because there is no default case, it is reported as uninialized.

Improve the switch by converting the most numerous set of cases
to the default and silence the false positive.
