drm/i915/tc: Fix TypeC port init/resume time sanitization

Atm during driver loading and system resume TypeC ports are accessed
before their HW/SW state is synced. Move the TypeC port sanitization to
the encoder's sync_state hook to fix this.

v2: Handle the encoder disabled case in gen11_dsi_sync_state() as well
    (Jose, Jani)
