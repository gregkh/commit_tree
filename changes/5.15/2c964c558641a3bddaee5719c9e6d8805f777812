netfilter: nf_tables: reverse order in rule replacement expansion

Deactivate old rule first, then append the new rule, so rule replacement
notification via netlink first reports the deletion of the old rule with
handle X in first place, then it adds the new rule (reusing the handle X
of the replaced old rule).

Note that the abort path releases the transaction that has been created
by nft_delrule() on error.
