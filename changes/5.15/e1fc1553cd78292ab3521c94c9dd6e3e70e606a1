kvm: x86: Add AMD PMU MSRs to msrs_to_save_all[]

Intel PMU MSRs is in msrs_to_save_all[], so add AMD PMU MSRs to have a
consistent behavior between Intel and AMD when using KVM_GET_MSRS,
KVM_SET_MSRS or KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST.

We have to add legacy and new MSRs to handle guests running without
X86_FEATURE_PERFCTR_CORE.
