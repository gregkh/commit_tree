KVM: arm64: Fix names of config register fields

Change the names of hcr_el2 register fields to match the Arm
Architecture Reference Manual. Easier for cross-referencing and
for grepping.

Also, change the name of CPTR_EL2_RES1 to CPTR_NVHE_EL2_RES1,
because res1 bits are different for VHE.

No functional change intended.
