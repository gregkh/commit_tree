powerpc/syscalls: Remove __NR__exit

__NR__exit is nowhere used. On most architectures it was removed by
commit 135ab6ec8fda ("[PATCH] remove remaining errno and
__KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ references") but not on powerpc.

powerpc removed __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ in commit 3db03b4afb3e ("[PATCH]
rename the provided execve functions to kernel_execve"), but __NR__exit
was left over.
