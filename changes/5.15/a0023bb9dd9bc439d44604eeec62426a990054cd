ata: sata_mv: Fix the error handling of mv_chip_id()

mv_init_host() propagates the value returned by mv_chip_id() which in turn
gets propagated by mv_pci_init_one() and hits local_pci_probe().

During the process of driver probing, the probe function should return < 0
for failure, otherwise, the kernel will treat value > 0 as success.

Since this is a bug rather than a recoverable runtime error we should
use dev_alert() instead of dev_err().
