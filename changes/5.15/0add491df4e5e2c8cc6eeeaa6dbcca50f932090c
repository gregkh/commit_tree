ext4: remove extent cache entries when truncating inline data

Conditionally remove all cached extents belonging to an inode
when truncating its inline data.  It's only necessary to attempt to
remove cached extents when a conversion from inline to extent storage
has been initiated (!EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA).  This avoids
unnecessary es lock overhead in the more common inline case.
