mtd_blkdevs: remove blktrans_ref_mutex

blktrans_ref_mutex is not actually needed.  The kref is serialized
internally, and devnum assignment in add_mtd_blktrans_dev happens before
the disk is added and thus any of the block_device_operations methods
otherwise using it are called.  It  is also already serialized by the
global mtd_table_mutex.
