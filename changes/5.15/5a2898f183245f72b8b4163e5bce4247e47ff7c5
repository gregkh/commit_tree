torture: Protect kvm-remote.sh directory trees from /tmp reaping

The kvm-remote.sh script places the datestamped directory containing
all the build artifacts in the destination systems' /tmp directories,
where they accumulate runtime artifacts such as console.log.  This works,
but some systems have a habit of removing files in /tmp that have not
been recently accessed.  This commit therefore runs a simple script that
periodically accesses all files in the datestamped directory.
