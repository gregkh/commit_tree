mmc: renesas_sdhi: fix regression with hard reset on old SDHIs

Old SDHI instances have a default value for the reset register which
keeps it in reset state by default. So, when applying a hard reset we
need to manually leave the soft reset state as well. Later SDHI
instances have a different default value, the one we write manually now.
