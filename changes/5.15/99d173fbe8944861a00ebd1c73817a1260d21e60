can: m_can: fix iomap_read_fifo() and iomap_write_fifo()

The read and writes from the fifo are from a buffer, with various
fields and data at predefined offsets. So, they should not be done to
the same address(or port) in case of val_count greater than 1.
Therefore, fix this by using iowrite32()/ioread32() instead of
ioread32_rep()/iowrite32_rep().

Also, the write into FIFO must be performed with an offset from the
message ram base address. Therefore, fix the base address to
mram_base.
