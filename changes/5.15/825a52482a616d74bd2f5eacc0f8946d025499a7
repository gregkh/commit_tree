ALSA: core: Fix double calls of snd_card_free() via devres

At the transition to the devres-managed card release, we've put the
check of double-free at trigger_card_release().  But this wasn't
enough, as the code path calls snd_card_free() again, and it would
lead to the doubly snd_card_free() calls.

Actually the v1 patch was correct to handle this, but I forgot that
corner case and moved the check to the more obvious place as I thought
it's clearer.  But, as usual, devils live in details.

This patch corrects the check of the double-free to the right place,
with a bit more comments.
