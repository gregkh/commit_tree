KVM: SEV-ES: rename guest_ins_data to sev_pio_data

We will be using this field for OUTS emulation as well, in case the
data that is pushed via OUTS spans more than one page.  In that case,
there will be a need to save the data pointer across exits to userspace.

So, change the name to something that refers to any kind of PIO.
Also spell out what it is used for, namely SEV-ES.

No functional change intended.
