bus: ti-sysc: Use CLKDM_NOAUTO for dra7 dcan1 for errata i893

Commit 94f6345712b3 ("bus: ti-sysc: Implement quirk handling for
CLKDM_NOAUTO") should have also added the quirk for dra7 dcan1 in
addition to dcan2 for errata i893 handling.

Let's also pass the quirk flag for legacy mode booting for if "ti,hwmods"
dts property is used with related dcan hwmod data. This should be only
needed if anybody needs to git bisect earlier stable trees though.
