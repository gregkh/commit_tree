drm: xlnx: zynqmp: release reset to DP controller before accessing DP registers

When insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko after rmmod it, system will hang with the
error log as below:

root@xilinx-zynqmp:~# insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko
[   88.391289] [drm] Initialized zynqmp-dpsub 1.0.0 20130509 for fd4a0000.display on minor 0

	<hang here>

This is because that in zynqmp_dp_probe it tries to access some DP
registers while the DP controller is still in the reset state. When
running "rmmod zynqmp_dpsub", zynqmp_dp_reset(dp, true) in
zynqmp_dp_phy_exit is called to force the DP controller into the reset
state. Then insmod will call zynqmp_dp_probe to program the DP registers,
but at this moment the DP controller hasn't been brought out of the reset
state yet since the function zynqmp_dp_reset(dp, false) is called later and
this will result the system hang.

Releasing the reset to DP controller before any read/write operation to it
will fix this issue. And for symmetry, move zynqmp_dp_reset() call from
zynqmp_dp_phy_exit() to zynqmp_dp_remove().
