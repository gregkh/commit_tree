drm/i915: Drop getparam support for I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_ENGINES

This has never been used by any userspace except IGT and provides no
real functionality beyond parroting back parameters userspace passed in
as part of context creation or via setparam.  If the context is in
legacy mode (where you use I915_EXEC_RENDER and friends), it returns
success with zero data so it's not useful for discovering what engines
are in the context.  It's also not a replacement for the recently
removed I915_CONTEXT_CLONE_ENGINES because it doesn't return any of the
balancing or bonding information.
