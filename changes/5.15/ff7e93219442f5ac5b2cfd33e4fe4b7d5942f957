ice: Fix failure to re-add LAN/RDMA Tx queues

Currently if the VSI is rebuilt/removed and the RDMA PF driver is active
the RDMA Tx queue scheduler node configuration will not be cleaned up.
This will cause the rebuild/re-add of the VSI to fail due to the
software structures not being correctly cleaned up for the VSI index.
Fix this by always calling ice_rm_vsi_rdma_cfg() for all VSI. If there
are no RDMA scheduler nodes created, then there is no harm in calling
ice_rm_vsi_rdma_cfg(). This change applies to all VSI types, so if
RDMA support is added for other VSI types they will also get this
change.
