KVM: selftests: Move vcpu_args_set into perf_test_util

perf_test_util is used to set up KVM selftests where vCPUs touch a
region of memory. The guest code is implemented in perf_test_util.c (not
the calling selftests). The guest code requires a 1 parameter, the
vcpuid, which has to be set by calling vcpu_args_set(vm, vcpu_id, 1,
vcpu_id).

Today all of the selftests that use perf_test_util are making this call.
Instead, perf_test_util should just do it. This will save some code but
more importantly prevents mistakes since totally non-obvious that this
needs to be called and failing to do so results in vCPUs not accessing
the right regions of memory.
