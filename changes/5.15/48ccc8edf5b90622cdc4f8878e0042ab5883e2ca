ARM: 9141/1: only warn about XIP address when not compile testing

In randconfig builds, we sometimes come across this warning:

arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: XIP start address may cause MPU programming issues

While this is helpful for actual systems to figure out why it
fails, the warning does not provide any benefit for build testing,
so guard it in a check for CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST, which is usually
set on randconfig builds.
