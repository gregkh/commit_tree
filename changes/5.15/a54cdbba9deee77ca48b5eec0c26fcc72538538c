can: c_can: exit c_can_do_tx() early if no frames have been sent

The c_can_poll() handles RX/TX events unconditionally. It may therefore
happen that c_can_do_tx() is called unnecessarily because the interrupt
was triggered by the reception of a frame. In these cases, we avoid to
execute unnecessary statements and exit immediately.
