drm/amdgpu: rework dma_resv handling v3

Drop the workaround and instead implement a better solution.

Basically we are now chaining all submissions using a dma_fence_chain
container and adding them as exclusive fence to the dma_resv object.

This way other drivers can still sync to the single exclusive fence
while amdgpu only sync to fences from different processes.

v3: add the shared fence first before the exclusive one
