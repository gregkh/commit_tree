net: hns3: disable sriov before unload hclge layer

HNS3 driver includes hns3.ko, hnae3.ko and hclge.ko.
hns3.ko includes network stack and pci_driver, hclge.ko includes
HW device action, algo_ops and timer task, hnae3.ko includes some
register function.

When SRIOV is enable and hclge.ko is removed, HW device is unloaded
but VF still exists, PF will not reply VF mbx messages, and cause
errors.

This patch fix it by disable SRIOV before remove hclge.ko.
