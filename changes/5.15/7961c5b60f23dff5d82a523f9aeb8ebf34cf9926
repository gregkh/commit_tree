drm/i915: Add TTM offset argument to mmap.

The FIXED mapping is only used for ttm, and tells userspace that the
mapping type is pre-defined. This disables the other type of mmap
offsets when discrete memory is used, so fix the selftests as well.

Document the struct as well, so it shows up in docbook.
