clk: rockchip: drop GRF dependency for rk3328/rk3036 pll types

The rk3036/rk3328 pll types were converted to checking the lock status
via the internal register in january 2020, so don't need the grf
reference since then.

But it was forgotten to remove grf check when deciding between the
pll rate ops (read-only vs. read-write), so a clock driver without
the needed grf reference might've been put into the read-only mode
just because the grf reference was missing.

This affected the rk356x that needs to reclock certain plls at boot.

Fix this by removing the check for the grf for selecting the utilized
operations.
