selftests/bpf: Support glob matching for test selector.

This patch adds '-a' and '-d' arguments supporting both exact string match as
well as using '*' wildcard in test/subtests selection. '-a' and '-t' can
co-exists, same as '-d' and '-b', in which case they just add to the list of
allowed or denied test selectors.

Caveat: Same as the current substring matching mechanism, test and subtest
selector applies independently, 'a*/b*' will execute all tests matching "a*",
and with subtest name matching "b*", but tests matching "a*" that has no
subtests will also be executed.
