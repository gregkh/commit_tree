KVM: x86: WARN if APIC HW/SW disable static keys are non-zero on unload

WARN if the static keys used to track if any vCPU has disabled its APIC
are left elevated at module exit.  Unlike the underflow case, nothing in
the static key infrastructure will complain if a key is left elevated,
and because an elevated key only affects performance, nothing in KVM will
fail if either key is improperly incremented.
