drm/amd/display: Fix resetting DCN3.1 HW when resuming from S4

[Why] On S4 resume we also need to fix detection of when to reload DMCUB
firmware because we're currently using the VBIOS version which isn't
compatible with the driver version.

[How] Update the hardware init check for DCN31 since it's the ASIC that
has this issue.
