RDMA/irdma: Do not hold qos mutex twice on QP resume

When irdma_ws_add fails, irdma_ws_remove is used to cleanup the leaf node.
This lead to holding the qos mutex twice in the QP resume path. Fix this
by avoiding the call to irdma_ws_remove and unwinding the error in
irdma_ws_add. This skips the call to irdma_tc_in_use function which is not
needed in the error unwind cases.
