dmaengine: idxd: fix setting up priv mode for dwq

DSA spec says WQ priv bit is 0 if the Privileged Mode Enable field of the
PCI Express PASID capability is 0 and pasid is enabled. Make sure that the
WQCFG priv field is set correctly according to usage type. Reject config if
setting up kernel WQ type and no support. Also add the correct priv setup
for a descriptor.
