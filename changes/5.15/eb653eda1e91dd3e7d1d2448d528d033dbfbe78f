RDMA/hns: Bugfix for incorrect association between dip_idx and dgid

dip_idx and dgid should be a one-to-one mapping relationship, but when
qp_num loops back to the start number, it may happen that two different
dgid are assiociated to the same dip_idx incorrectly.

One solution is to store the qp_num that is not assigned to dip_idx in an
array. When a dip_idx needs to be allocated to a new dgid, an spare qp_num
is extracted and assigned to dip_idx.
