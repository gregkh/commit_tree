octeontx2-af: Add PTP device id for CN10K and 95O silcons

CN10K slicon has different device id for PTP device.
Hence this patch updates the driver with new id.
Though ptp driver being a separate driver AF manages
configuring PTP block by all PFs. To manage ptp, AF
driver checks in its probe whether
1. ptp hardware device found on silicon
2. A driver is bound to ptp device
3. The ptp driver probe is successful

In failure of cases 1 and 3, AF proceeds with out ptp
and for case 2 defers the probe. This patch refactors
code also to check for all the PTP device ids given in
ptp device ids table for case 1.

Also added PTP device ID for 95O silicon
