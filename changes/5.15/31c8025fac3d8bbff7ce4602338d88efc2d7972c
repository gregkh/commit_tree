of: restricted dma: Fix condition for rmem init

of_dma_set_restricted_buffer fails to handle negative return values from
of_property_count_elems_of_size, e.g. when the property does not exist.
This results in an attempt to assign a non-existent reserved memory
region to the device and a warning being printed. Fix the condition to
take negative values into account.
