ALSA: hda/analog - Sink ad198x_shutup() and shuffle CONFIG_PM guards

When CONFIG_PM is not set, there is an unused function warning:

sound/pci/hda/patch_analog.c:115:13: warning: unused function
'ad198x_shutup' [-Wunused-function]
static void ad198x_shutup(struct hda_codec *codec)
            ^
1 warning generated.

Sink ad198x_shutup() into ad198x_suspend(), as it is only called in that
one space. Move the CONFIG_PM guards above ad198x_power_eapd_write() as
it is only called in ad198x_power_eapd(), which is in turn only called
in ad198x_power_eapd(). Those two functions are large enough that they
are left alone.
