scsi: acornscsi: Remove tagged queuing vestiges

The acornscsi driver has a config option to enable tagged queuing, but this
option gets disabled in the driver itself with the comment 'needs to be
debugged'.  As this is a _really_ old driver I doubt anyone will be wanting
to invest time here, so remove the tagged queue vestiges and make our lives
easier.
