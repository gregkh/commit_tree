ARM: config: multi v7: Enable dependancies

Some drivers have not been built as they gained dependencies in kconfig but those
dependencies were not added to the defconfig.

The MSM pinctrl drivers fell out of the defconfig as of commit be117ca32261
("pinctrl: qcom: Kconfig: Rework PINCTRL_MSM to be a depenency rather then a
selected config"). Add PINCTRL_MSM so these stay enabled.

EDAC depends on RAS, so enable it to ensure the EDAC drivers stay
enabled.
