firmware: qcom_scm: QCOM_SCM should depend on ARCH_QCOM

The Qualcomm Secure Channel Manager (SCM) is only present on Qualcomm
SoCs.  All drivers using it select QCOM_SCM, and depend on ARCH_QCOM.
Until recently, QCOM_SCM was an invisible symbol, but this was changed
by adding loadable module support, exposing it to all ARM and ARM64
users.  Hence add a dependency on ARCH_QCOM, to prevent asking the user
about this driver when configuring a kernel without Qualcomm SoC
support.

While at it, drop the dependency on ARM || ARM64, as that is implied by
HAVE_ARM_SMCCC.
