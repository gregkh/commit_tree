thermal/drivers/int340x: Use IMOK independently

Some chrome platform requires IMOK method in coreboot. But these platforms
don't use GDDV data vault in coreboot. As per current code flow, to enable
and use IMOK only, we need to have GDDV support as well in coreboot. This
patch removes the dependency for IMOK from GDDV to enable and use IMOK
independently.
