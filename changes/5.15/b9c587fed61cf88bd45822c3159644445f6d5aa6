dsa: mv88e6xxx: Include tagger overhead when setting MTU for DSA and CPU ports

Same members of the Marvell Ethernet switches impose MTU restrictions
on ports used for connecting to the CPU or another switch for DSA. If
the MTU is set too low, tagged frames will be discarded. Ensure the
worst case tagger overhead is included in setting the MTU for DSA and
CPU ports.
