scsi: ufs: ufshpb: Remove HPB2.0 flows

The Host Performance Buffer feature allows UFS read commands to carry the
physical media addresses along with the LBAs, thus allowing less internal
L2P-table switches in the device.  HPB1.0 allowed a single LBA, while
HPB2.0 increases this capacity up to 255 blocks.

Carrying more than a single record, the read operation is no longer purely
of type "read" but a "hybrid" command: Writing the physical address to the
device in one operation and reading back the required payload in another.

The JEDEC HPB spec defines two commands for this operation:
HPB-WRITE-BUFFER (0x2) to write the physical addresses to device, and
HPB-READ to read the payload.

With the current HPB design the UFS driver has no alternative but to divide
the READ request into 2 separate commands: HPB-WRITE-BUFFER and HPB-READ.
This causes a great deal of aggravation to the block layer guys who
demanded that we completely revert the entire HPB driver regardless of the
huge amount of corporate effort already invested in it.

As a compromise, remove only the pieces that implement the 2.0
specification. This is done as a matter of urgency for the final 5.15
release.
