platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Increase virtual timeout to 10s

Commit a7d53dbbc70a ("platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Increase virtual
timeout from 3 to 5 seconds") states that the recommended timeout range
is 5-10 seconds. Adjust the timeout value to the higher of those i.e 10
seconds, to account for situations where the 5 seconds is insufficient
for disconnect command success.
