ravb: Add no_ptp_cfg_active to struct ravb_hw_info

There are some H/W differences for the gPTP feature between
R-Car Gen3, R-Car Gen2, and RZ/G2L as below.

1) On R-Car Gen2, gPTP support is not active in config mode.
2) On R-Car Gen3, gPTP support is active in config mode.
3) RZ/G2L does not support the gPTP feature.

Add a no_ptp_cfg_active hw feature bit to struct ravb_hw_info for
handling gPTP for R-Car Gen2.
