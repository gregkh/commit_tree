x86/PVH: adjust function/data placement

Two of the variables can live in .init.data, allowing the open-coded
placing in .data to go away. Another "variable" is used to communicate a
size value only to very early assembly code, which hence can be both
const and live in .init.*. Additionally two functions were lacking
__init annotations.
