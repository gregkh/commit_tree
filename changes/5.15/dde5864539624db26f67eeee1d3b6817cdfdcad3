drm/amd/pm: drop smu_v13_0_1.c|h files for yellow carp

Since there's nothing special in smu implementation for yellow carp,
it's better to reuse the common smu_v13_0 interfaces and drop the
specific smu_v13_0_1.c|h files.

v2: remove the duplicate register offset and shift mask header files as
well.
