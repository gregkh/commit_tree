sched: Introduce task_struct::user_cpus_ptr to track requested affinity

In preparation for saving and restoring the user-requested CPU affinity
mask of a task, add a new cpumask_t pointer to 'struct task_struct'.

If the pointer is non-NULL, then the mask is copied across fork() and
freed on task exit.
