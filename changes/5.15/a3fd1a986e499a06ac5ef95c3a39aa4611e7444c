ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix the mic type detection issue for ASUS G551JW

We need to define the codec pin 0x1b to be the mic, but somehow
the mic doesn't support hot plugging detection, and Windows also has
this issue, so we set it to phantom headset-mic.

Also the determine_headset_type() often returns the omtp type by a
mistake when we plug a ctia headset, this makes the mic can't record
sound at all. Because most of the headset are ctia type nowadays and
some machines have the fixed ctia type audio jack, it is possible this
machine has the fixed ctia jack too. Here we set this mic jack to
fixed ctia type, this could avoid the mic type detection mistake and
make the ctia headset work stable.
