perf tools: Allow build-id with trailing zeros

Currently perf saves a build-id with size but old versions assumes the
size of 20.  In case the build-id is less than 20 (like for MD5), it'd
fill the rest with 0s.

I saw a problem when old version of perf record saved a binary in the
build-id cache and new version of perf reads the data.  The symbols
should be read from the build-id cache (as the path no longer has the
same binary) but it failed due to mismatch in the build-id.

  symsrc__init: build id mismatch for /home/namhyung/.debug/.build-id/53/e4c2f42a4c61a2d632d92a72afa08f00000000/elf.

The build-id event in the data has 20 byte build-ids, but it saw a
different size (16) when it reads the build-id of the elf file in the
build-id cache.

  $ readelf -n ~/.debug/.build-id/53/e4c2f42a4c61a2d632d92a72afa08f00000000/elf

    GNU                  0x00000010	NT_GNU_BUILD_ID (unique build ID bitstring)
      Build ID: 53e4c2f42a4c61a2d632d92a72afa08f

Let's fix this by allowing trailing zeros if the size is different.
