regulator: Documentation fix for regulator error notification helper

The helper to send IRQ notification for regulator errors had still
old description mentioning calling BUG() as a last resort when
error status reading has kept failing for more times than a given
threshold.

The impementation calling BUG() did never end-up in-tree but was
replaced by hopefully more sophisticated handler trying to power-off
the system.

Fix the documentation to reflect actual behaviour.
