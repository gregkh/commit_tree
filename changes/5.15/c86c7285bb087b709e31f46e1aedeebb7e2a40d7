Bluetooth: btintel: Fix the legacy bootloader returns tlv based version

From the ThP, it supports both legacy and TLV based HCI_Intel_Read_Version
command after downloading the operational firmware, and it causes the
driver to choose the wrong setup routines and missing firmware/ddc file.

So, as a workaround, this patch checks the fw variant from the TLV based
version, and if the device is legacy bootloader device, the legacy
HCI_Intel_Read_Version command is used to get the legacy version
information and run the legacy bootloader setup with it.
