ARM: dts: qcom: apq8064: Use 27MHz PXO clock as DSI PLL reference

The 28NM DSI PLL driver for msm8960 calculates with a 27MHz reference
clock and should hence use PXO, not CXO which runs at 19.2MHz.

Note that none of the DSI PHY/PLL drivers currently use this "ref"
clock; they all rely on (sometimes inexistant) global clock names and
usually function normally without a parent clock.  This discrepancy will
be corrected in a future patch, for which this change needs to be in
place first.
