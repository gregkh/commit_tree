scsi: mpt3sas: Fix reference tag handling for WRITE_INSERT

Testing revealed a problem with how the reference tag was handled for
a WRITE_INSERT operation. The SCSI_PROT_REF_CHECK flag is not set when
the controller is asked to generate the protection information
(i.e. not DIX). And as a result the initial reference tag would not be
set in the WRITE_INSERT case.

Separate handling of the REF_CHECK and REF_INCREMENT flags to align
with both the DIX spec and the MPI implementation.
