phy: amlogic: meson8b-usb2: don't log an error on -EPROBE_DEFER

devm_phy_create can return -EPROBE_DEFER if the vbus-supply is not ready
yet. Silence this warning as the driver framework will re-attempt
registering the PHY. Use dev_err_probe() for phy resources to indicate
the deferral reason when waiting for the resource to come up.
