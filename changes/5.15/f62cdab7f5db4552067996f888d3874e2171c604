rtl8xxxu: disable interrupt_in transfer for 8188cu and 8192cu

There will be crazy numbers of interrupts triggered by 8188cu and
8192cu module, around 8000~10000 interrupts per second, on the usb
host controller. Compare with the vendor driver source code, it's
mapping to the configuration CONFIG_USB_INTERRUPT_IN_PIPE and it is
disabled by default.

Since the interrupt transfer is neither used for TX/RX nor H2C
commands. Disable it to avoid the excessive amount of interrupts
for the 8188cu and 8192cu module which I only have for verification.
