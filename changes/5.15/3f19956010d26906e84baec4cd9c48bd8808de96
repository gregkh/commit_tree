samples: bpf: Convert xdp_monitor_kern.o to XDP samples helper

We already moved all the functionality it provided in XDP samples helper
userspace and kernel BPF object, so just delete the unneeded code.

We also add generation of BPF skeleton and compilation using clang
-target bpf for files ending with .bpf.c suffix (to denote that they use
vmlinux.h).
