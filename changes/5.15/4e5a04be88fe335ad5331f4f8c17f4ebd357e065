pinctrl: amd: disable and mask interrupts on probe

Some systems such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 leave interrupts
enabled and configured for use in sleep states on boot, which cause
unexpected behaviour such as spurious wakes and failed resumes in
s2idle states.

As interrupts should not be enabled until they are claimed and
explicitly enabled, disabling any interrupts mistakenly left enabled by
firmware should be safe.
