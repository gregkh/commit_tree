ALSA: oxygen: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch converts the resource management in PCI oxygen drivers with
devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is converted
with the corresponding devres helper, and the page allocations are
done with the devres helper.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
