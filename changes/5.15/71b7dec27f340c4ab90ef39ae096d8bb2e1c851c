mptcp: less aggressive retransmission strategy

The current mptcp re-inject strategy is very aggressive,
we have mptcp-level retransmissions even on single subflow
connection, if the link in-use is lossy.

Let's be a little more conservative: we do retransmit
only if at least a subflow has write and rtx queue empty.

Additionally use the backup subflows only if the active
subflows are stale - no progresses in at least an rtx period
and ignore stale subflows for rtx timeout update
