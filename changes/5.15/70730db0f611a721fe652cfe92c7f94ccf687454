PCI/VPD: Check Resource Item Names against those valid for type

Previously, we checked for PCI_VPD_STIN_END, PCI_VPD_LTIN_ID_STRING, etc.,
outside the Large and Small Resource cases, so we checked Large Resource
Item Names against a Small Resource name and vice versa.

Move these tests into the Large and Small Resource cases, so we only check
PCI_VPD_STIN_END for Small Resources and PCI_VPD_LTIN_* for Large
Resources.
