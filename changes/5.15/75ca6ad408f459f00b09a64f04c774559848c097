ext4: fix loff_t overflow in ext4_max_bitmap_size()

We should use unsigned long long rather than loff_t to avoid
overflow in ext4_max_bitmap_size() for comparison before returning.
w/o this patch sbi->s_bitmap_maxbytes was becoming a negative
value due to overflow of upper_limit (with has_huge_files as true)

Below is a quick test to trigger it on a 64KB pagesize system.

sudo mkfs.ext4 -b 65536 -O ^has_extents,^64bit /dev/loop2
sudo mount /dev/loop2 /mnt
sudo echo "hello" > /mnt/hello 	-> This will error out with
				"echo: write error: File too large"
