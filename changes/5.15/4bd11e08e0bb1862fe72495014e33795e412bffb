selftests/bpf: Add ref_ctr_offset selftests

Extend attach_probe selftests to specify ref_ctr_offset for uprobe/uretprobe
and validate that its value is incremented from zero.

Turns out that once uprobe is attached with ref_ctr_offset, uretprobe for the
same location/function *has* to use ref_ctr_offset as well, otherwise
perf_event_open() fails with -EINVAL. So this test uses ref_ctr_offset for
both uprobe and uretprobe, even though for the purpose of test uprobe would be
enough.
