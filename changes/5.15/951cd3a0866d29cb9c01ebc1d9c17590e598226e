firmware: include drivers/firmware/Kconfig unconditionally

Compile-testing drivers that require access to a firmware layer
fails when that firmware symbol is unavailable. This happened
twice this week:

 - My proposed to change to rework the QCOM_SCM firmware symbol
   broke on ppc64 and others.

 - The cs_dsp firmware patch added device specific firmware loader
   into drivers/firmware, which broke on the same set of
   architectures.

We should probably do the same thing for other subsystems as well,
but fix this one first as this is a dependency for other patches
getting merged.
