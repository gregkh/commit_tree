ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for VF0770

The device advertises 8 formats, but only a rate of 48kHz is honored
by the hardware and 24 bits give chopped audio, so only report the
one working combination. This fixes out-of-the-box audio experience
with PipeWire which otherwise attempts to choose S24_3LE (while
PulseAudio defaulted to S16_LE).
