staging: rtl8192u: Avoid field-overflowing memcpy()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Split the 3 addr memcpy() into 3 memcpy() calls so the compiler doesn't
think an overflowing memcpy() happens against the addr1 field (the
neighbors are intended to be copied as well).

ieee80211_read_qos_param_element() copies a struct ieee80211_info_element
into a struct ieee80211_qos_information_element, but is actually wanting to
copy into the larger struct ieee80211_qos_parameter_info (the contents of
ac_params_record[] is later examined). Refactor the routine to perform
centralized checks, and copy the entire contents directly (since the id
and len members match the elementID and length members):

struct ieee80211_info_element {
        u8 id;
        u8 len;
        u8 data[];
} __packed;

struct ieee80211_qos_information_element {
        u8 elementID;
        u8 length;
        u8 qui[QOS_OUI_LEN];
        u8 qui_type;
        u8 qui_subtype;
        u8 version;
        u8 ac_info;
} __packed;

struct ieee80211_qos_parameter_info {
        struct ieee80211_qos_information_element info_element;
        u8 reserved;
        struct ieee80211_qos_ac_parameter ac_params_record[QOS_QUEUE_NUM];
} __packed;

Additionally replace old-style zero-element arrays with flexible arrays.
