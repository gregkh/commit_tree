io-wq: max_worker fixes

First, fix nr_workers checks against max_workers, with max_worker
registration, it may pretty easily happen that nr_workers > max_workers.

Also, synchronise writing to acct->max_worker with wqe->lock. It's not
an actual problem, but as we don't care about io_wqe_create_worker(),
it's better than WRITE_ONCE()/READ_ONCE().
