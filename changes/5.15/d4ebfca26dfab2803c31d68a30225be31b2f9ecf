x86/resctrl: Fix kfree() of the wrong type in domain_add_cpu()

Commit in Fixes separated the architecture specific and filesystem parts
of the resctrl domain structures.

This left the error paths in domain_add_cpu() kfree()ing the memory with
the wrong type.

This will cause a problem if someone adds a new member to struct
rdt_hw_domain meaning d_resctrl is no longer the first member.
