net: nxp: lpc_eth.c: avoid hang when bringing interface down

A hard hang is observed whenever the ethernet interface is brought
down. If the PHY is stopped before the LPC core block is reset,
the SoC will hang. Comparing lpc_eth_close() and lpc_eth_open() I
re-arranged the ordering of the functions calls in lpc_eth_close() to
reset the hardware before stopping the PHY.
