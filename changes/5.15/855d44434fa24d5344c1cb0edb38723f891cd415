mm/secretmem: avoid letting secretmem_users drop to zero

Quoting Dmitry:
 "refcount_inc() needs to be done before fd_install(). After
  fd_install() finishes, the fd can be used by userspace and
  we can have secret data in memory before the refcount_inc().

  A straightforward misuse where a user will predict the returned
  fd in another thread before the syscall returns and will use it
  to store secret data is somewhat dubious because such a user just
  shoots themself in the foot.

  But a more interesting misuse would be to close the predicted fd
  and decrement the refcount before the corresponding refcount_inc,
  this way one can briefly drop the refcount to zero while there are
  other users of secretmem."

Move fd_install() after refcount_inc().
