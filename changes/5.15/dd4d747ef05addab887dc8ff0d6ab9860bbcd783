hwmon: (w83793) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structure field

If driver read tmp value sufficient for
(tmp & 0x08) && (!(tmp & 0x80)) && ((tmp & 0x7) == ((tmp >> 4) & 0x7))
from device then Null pointer dereference occurs.
(It is possible if tmp = 0b0xyz1xyz, where same literals mean same numbers)
Also lm75[] does not serve a purpose anymore after switching to
devm_i2c_new_dummy_device() in w83791d_detect_subclients().

The patch fixes possible NULL pointer dereference by removing lm75[].
