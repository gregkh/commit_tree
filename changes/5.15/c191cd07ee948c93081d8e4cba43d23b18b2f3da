fuse: clean up fuse_mount destruction

1. call fuse_mount_destroy() for open coded variants

2. before deactivate_locked_super() don't need fuse_mount destruction since
that will now be done (if ->s_fs_info is not cleared)

3. rearrange fuse_mount setup in fuse_get_tree_submount() so that the
regular pattern can be used
