ARM: dts: am335x-bone: switch to new cpsw switch drv

The dual_mac mode has been preserved the same way between legacy and new
driver, and one port devices works the same as 1 dual_mac port - it's safe
to switch drivers.

So, Switch BeagleBone boards to use new cpsw switch driver. Those boards
have or 2 Ext. port wired and configured in dual_mac mode by default, or
only 1 Ext. port.

For am335x-sancloud-bbe-common.dtsi also removed duplicated davinci_mdio DT
nodes which already defined in am335x-bone-common.dtsi.
