staging: rtl8192u: Fix bitwise vs logical operator in TranslateRxSignalStuff819xUsb()

clang warns:

drivers/staging/rtl8192u/r8192U_core.c:4268:20: warning: bitwise and of
boolean expressions; did you mean logical and? [-Wbool-operation-and]
        bpacket_toself =  bpacket_match_bssid &
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                              &&
1 warning generated.

Replace the bitwise AND with a logical one to clear up the warning, as
that is clearly what was intended.
