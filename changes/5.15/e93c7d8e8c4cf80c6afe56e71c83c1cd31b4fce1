RDMA/irdma: Process extended CQ entries correctly

The valid bit for extended CQE's written by HW is retrieved from the
incorrect quad-word. This leads to missed completions for any UD traffic
particularly after a wrap-around.

Get the valid bit for extended CQE's from the correct quad-word in the
descriptor.
