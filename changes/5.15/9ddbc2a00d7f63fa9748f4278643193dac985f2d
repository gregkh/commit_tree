qlcnic: Remove redundant unlock in qlcnic_pinit_from_rom

Previous commit 68233c583ab4 removes the qlcnic_rom_lock()
in qlcnic_pinit_from_rom(), but remains its corresponding
unlock function, which is odd. I'm not very sure whether the
lock is missing, or the unlock is redundant. This bug is
suggested by a static analysis tool, please advise.
