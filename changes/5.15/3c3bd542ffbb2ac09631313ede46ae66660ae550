selftests/bpf: Add exponential backoff to map_update_retriable in test_maps

Using a fixed delay of 1 microsecond has proven flaky in slow CPU environment,
e.g. Github Actions CI system. This patch adds exponential backoff with a cap
of 50ms to reduce the flakiness of the test. Initial delay is chosen at random
in the range [0ms, 5ms).
