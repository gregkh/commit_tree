HID: magicmouse: high-resolution scroll threshold

In order to avoid triggering involuntary high-resolution scroll events
due to tiny touch movement deltas, add a movement threshold.

The value chosen for the threshold, about 1.5 ~ 2 mm, is similar to the
threshold used on touchpads by libinput (see libinput
evdev-mt-touchpad-gestures.c) to try to keep the scroll experience
consistent.
