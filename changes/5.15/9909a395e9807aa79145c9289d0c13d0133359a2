iio: adc: rzg2l_adc: Fix -EBUSY timeout error return

Currently when a timeout occurs in rzg2l_adc_hw_init the error -EBUSY is
assigned to ret but the error code is used as the function is hard-coded
to return 0.  The variable ret is 0 before entering the while-loop hence
the fix is just to return ret at the end of the function to return the
success 0 or -EBUSY return code.
