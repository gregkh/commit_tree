nfsd: fix error handling of register_pernet_subsys() in init_nfsd()

init_nfsd() should not unregister pernet subsys if the register fails
but should instead unwind from the last successful operation which is
register_filesystem().

Unregistering a failed register_pernet_subsys() call can result in
a kernel GPF as revealed by programmatically injecting an error in
register_pernet_subsys().

Verified the fix handled failure gracefully with no lingering nfsd
entry in /proc/filesystems.  This change was introduced by the commit
bd5ae9288d64 ("nfsd: register pernet ops last, unregister first"),
the original error handling logic was correct.
