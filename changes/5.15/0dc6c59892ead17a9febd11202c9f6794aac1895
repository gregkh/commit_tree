ARM: dts: qcom: apq8064: correct clock names

Since new code doesn't take old clk names in account, it does fixes
error:

msm_dsi 4700000.mdss_dsi: dev_pm_opp_set_clkname: Couldn't find clock: -2

and following kernel oops introduced by
b0530eb1191 ("drm/msm/dpu: Use OPP API to set clk/perf state").

Also removes warning about deprecated clock names.

Tested against linux-5.10.y LTS on Nexus 7 2013.
