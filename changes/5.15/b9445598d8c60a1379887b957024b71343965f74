io_uring: openat directly into fixed fd table

Instead of opening a file into a process's file table as usual and then
registering the fd within io_uring, some users may want to skip the
first step and place it directly into io_uring's fixed file table.
This patch adds such a capability for IORING_OP_OPENAT and
IORING_OP_OPENAT2.

The behaviour is controlled by setting sqe->file_index, where 0 implies
the old behaviour using normal file tables. If non-zero value is
specified, then it will behave as described and place the file into a
fixed file slot sqe->file_index - 1. A file table should be already
created, the slot should be valid and empty, otherwise the operation
will fail.

Keep the error codes consistent with IORING_OP_FILES_UPDATE, ENXIO and
EINVAL on inappropriate fixed tables, and return EBADF on collision with
already registered file.

Note: IOSQE_FIXED_FILE can't be used to switch between modes, because
accept takes a file, and it already uses the flag with a different
meaning.
