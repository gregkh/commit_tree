printk: Add printk.console_no_auto_verbose boot parameter

console_verbose() increases console loglevel to
CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_MOTORMOUTH, which provides more information
to debug a panic/oops.

Unfortunately, in Arista we maintain some DUTs (Device Under Test) that
are configured to have 9600 baud rate. While verbose console messages
have their value to post-analyze crashes, on such setup they:
- may prevent panic/oops messages being printed
- take too long to flush on console resulting in watchdog reboot

In all our setups we use kdump which saves dmesg buffer after panic,
so in reality those extra messages on console provide no additional value,
but rather add risk of not getting to __crash_kexec().

Provide printk.console_no_auto_verbose boot parameter, which allows
to switch off printk being verbose on oops/panic/lockdep.
