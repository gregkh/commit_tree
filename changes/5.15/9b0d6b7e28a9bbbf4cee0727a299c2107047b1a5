vfio/ap,ccw: Fix open/close when multiple device FDs are open

The user can open multiple device FDs if it likes, however these open()
functions call vfio_register_notifier() on some device global
state. Calling vfio_register_notifier() twice in will trigger a WARN_ON
from notifier_chain_register() and the first close will wrongly delete the
notifier and more.

Since these really want the new open/close_device() semantics just change
the functions over.
