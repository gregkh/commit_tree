serial: 8250_omap: Handle optional overrun-throttle-ms property

Handle optional overrun-throttle-ms property as done for 8250_fsl in commit
6d7f677a2afa ("serial: 8250: Rate limit serial port rx interrupts during
input overruns"). This can be used to rate limit the UART interrupts on
noisy lines that end up producing messages like the following:

ttyS ttyS2: 4 input overrun(s)

At least on droid4, the multiplexed USB and UART port is left to UART mode
by the bootloader for a debug console, and if a USB charger is connected
on boot, we get noise on the UART until the PMIC related drivers for PHY
and charger are loaded.

With this patch and overrun-throttle-ms = <500> we avoid the extra rx
interrupts.
