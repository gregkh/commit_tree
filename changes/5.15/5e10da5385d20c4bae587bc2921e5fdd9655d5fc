skbuff: allow 'slow_gro' for skb carring sock reference

This change leverages the infrastructure introduced by the previous
patches to allow soft devices passing to the GRO engine owned skbs
without impacting the fast-path.

It's up to the GRO caller ensuring the slow_gro bit validity before
invoking the GRO engine. The new helper skb_prepare_for_gro() is
introduced for that goal.

On slow_gro, skbs are aggregated only with equal sk.
Additionally, skb truesize on GRO recycle and free is correctly
updated so that sk wmem is not changed by the GRO processing.

rfc-> v1:
 - fixed bad truesize on dev_gro_receive NAPI_FREE
 - use the existing state bit
