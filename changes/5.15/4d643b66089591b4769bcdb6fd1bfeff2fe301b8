blk-zoned: allow BLKREPORTZONE without CAP_SYS_ADMIN

A user space process should not need the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability set
in order to perform a BLKREPORTZONE ioctl.

Getting the zone report is required in order to get the write pointer.
Neither read() nor write() requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, so it is reasonable
that a user space process that can read/write from/to the device, also
can get the write pointer. (Since e.g. writes have to be at the write
pointer.)
