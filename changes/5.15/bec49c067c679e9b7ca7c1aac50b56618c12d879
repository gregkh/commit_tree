mm, memcg: remove unused functions

Since commit 2d146aa3aa84 ("mm: memcontrol: switch to rstat"), last user
of memcg_stat_item_in_bytes() is gone.  And since commit fa40d1ee9f15
("mm: vmscan: memcontrol: remove mem_cgroup_select_victim_node()"), only
the declaration of mem_cgroup_select_victim_node() is remained here.
Remove them.
