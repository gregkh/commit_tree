ASoC: rt5640: Add optional hp_det_gpio parameter to rt5640_detect_headset()

Some devices don't use the builtin jack-detect but can still benefit
from the mic-bias-current over-current-detection headphones vs
headset detection done by rt5640_detect_headset().

In this case the jack-inserted check done by rt5640_detect_headset()
needs to be done through a GPIO rather then by using the codec's
builtin jack-detect. Add an optional hp_det_gpio parameter and export
rt5640_detect_headset() for use on machines where jack-detect is
handled outside of the codec.
