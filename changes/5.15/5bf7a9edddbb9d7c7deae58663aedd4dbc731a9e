iwlwifi: convert flat GEO profile table to a struct version

The GEO profiles have been stored in single-dimension arrays and the
access has been done via a single index.  We will soon need to support
different revisions of this table, which will make the flat array even
harder to handle.  To prepare for that, convert the single-dimension
array to a struct with substructures.
