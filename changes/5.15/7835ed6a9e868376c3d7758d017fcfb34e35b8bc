drm/panel-sony-acx424akp: Modernize backlight handling

This converts the internal backlight in the Sony ACX424AKP
driver to do it the canonical way:

- Assign the panel->backlight during probe.
- Let the panel framework handle the backlight.
- Make the backlight .set_brightness() turn the backlight
  off completely if blank.
- Fix some dev_err_probe() use cases along the way.

Tested on the U8500 HREF520 reference design.
