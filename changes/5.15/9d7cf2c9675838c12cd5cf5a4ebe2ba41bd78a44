Drivers: hv: Add arch independent default functions for some Hyper-V handlers

Architecture independent Hyper-V code calls various arch-specific handlers
when needed.  To aid in supporting multiple architectures, provide weak
defaults that can be overridden by arch-specific implementations where
appropriate.  But when arch-specific overrides aren't needed or haven't
been implemented yet for a particular architecture, these stubs reduce
the amount of clutter under arch/.

No functional change.
