scsi: lpfc: Fix cq_id truncation in rq create

On the newer hardware, CQ_ID values can be larger than seen on previous
generations. This exposed an issue in the driver where its definition of
cq_id in the RQ Create mailbox cmd was too small, thus the cq_id was
truncated, causing the command to fail.

Revise the RQ_CREATE CQ_ID field to its proper size (16 bits).
