net: bridge: mcast: Associate the seqcount with its protecting lock.

The sequence count bridge_mcast_querier::seq is protected by
net_bridge::multicast_lock but seqcount_init() does not associate the
seqcount with the lock. This leads to a warning on PREEMPT_RT because
preemption is still enabled.

Let seqcount_init() associate the seqcount with lock that protects the
write section. Remove lockdep_assert_held_once() because lockdep already checks
whether the associated lock is held.
