skb_expand_head() adjust skb->truesize incorrectly

Christoph Paasch reports [1] about incorrect skb->truesize
after skb_expand_head() call in ip6_xmit.
This may happen because of two reasons:
- skb_set_owner_w() for newly cloned skb is called too early,
before pskb_expand_head() where truesize is adjusted for (!skb-sk) case.
- pskb_expand_head() does not adjust truesize in (skb->sk) case.
In this case sk->sk_wmem_alloc should be adjusted too.
