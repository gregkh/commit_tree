ARM: config: mutli v7: Reenable FB dependency

DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION previously selected FB and was default y as long as DRM
was enabled. In commit f611b1e7624c ("drm: Avoid circular dependencies for
CONFIG_FB") the select was replaced with a depends on FB, disabling the
drivers that depended on it.

Renable FB so we get back FB_EFI, FB_WM8505, FB_SH_MOBILE_LCDC, FB_SIMPLE and
VIDEO_VIVID.

It must be set to y and not a module as the test driver VIDEO_VIVID
requires it to be built in.
