selftests, bpf: test_lwt_ip_encap: Really disable rp_filter

It's not enough to set net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0, that does not override
a greater rp_filter value on the individual interfaces. We also need to set
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0 before creating the interfaces. That way,
they'll also get their own rp_filter value of zero.
