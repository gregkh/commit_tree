ACPI: platform-profile: call sysfs_notify() from platform_profile_store()

Drivers like thinkpad_acpi and ideapad_laptop call the
platform_profile_notify() helper when the profile is changed by hardware
(the embedded-controller/EC) in response to an EC handled hotkey.

This allows userspace to monitor for such changes by polling for POLLPRI
on the platform_profile sysfs file. But the profile can also be changed
underneath a userspace program monitoring it by anonther userspace program
storing a new value.

Add a sysfs_notify() call to platform_profile_store(), so that userspace
programs monitoring for changes also get notified in this case.

Also update the documentation to document that POLLPRI polling can be
used to watch for changes.
