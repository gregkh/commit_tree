dt-bindings: dma: add alternative REQ/ACK protocol selection in stm32-dma

Default REQ/ACK protocol consists in maintaining ACK signal up to the
removal of REQuest and the transfer completion.
In case of alternative REQ/ACK protocol, ACK de-assertion does not wait the
removal of the REQuest, but only the transfer completion.
Due to a possible DMA stream lock when transferring data to/from STM32
USART/UART, this new bindings allow to select this alternative protocol in
device tree, especially for STM32 USART/UART nodes.
