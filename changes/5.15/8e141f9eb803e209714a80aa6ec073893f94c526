block: drain file system I/O on del_gendisk

Instead of delaying draining of file system I/O related items like the
blk-qos queues, the integrity read workqueue and timeouts only when the
request_queue is removed, do that when del_gendisk is called.  This is
important for SCSI where the upper level drivers that control the gendisk
are separate entities, and the disk can be freed much earlier than the
request_queue, or can even be unbound without tearing down the queue.

Fixes: edb0872f44ec ("block: move the bdi from the request_queue to the gendisk")
