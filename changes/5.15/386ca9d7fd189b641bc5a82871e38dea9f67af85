selftests: KVM: Explicitly use movq to read xmm registers

Compiling the KVM selftests with clang emits the following warning:

>> include/x86_64/processor.h:297:25: error: variable 'xmm0' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
>>                return (unsigned long)xmm0;

where xmm0 is accessed via an uninitialized register variable.

Indeed, this is a misuse of register variables, which really should only
be used for specifying register constraints on variables passed to
inline assembly. Rather than attempting to read xmm registers via
register variables, just explicitly perform the movq from the desired
xmm register.
