dt-bindings: power: convert rockchip-io-domain.txt to YAML

Current dts files with 'io-domains' nodes are manually verified.
In order to automate this process rockchip-io-domain.txt has to be
converted to YAML.

Changed:
  Add supply properties for:
    rockchip,rk3328-io-voltage-domain
    rockchip,rv1108-io-voltage-domain
    rockchip,rv1108-pmu-io-voltage-domain
