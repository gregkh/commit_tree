drm/msm/dp: reduce link rate if failed at link training 1

Reduce link rate and re start link training if link training 1
failed due to loss of clock recovery done to fix Link Layer
CTS case 4.3.1.7.  Also only update voltage and pre-emphasis
swing level after link training started to fix Link Layer CTS
case 4.3.1.6.

Changes in V2:
-- replaced cr_status with link_status[DP_LINK_STATUS_SIZE]
-- replaced dp_ctrl_any_lane_cr_done() with dp_ctrl_colco_recovery_any_ok()
-- replaced dp_ctrl_any_ane_cr_lose() with !drm_dp_clock_recovery_ok()

Changes in V3:
-- return failed if lane_count <= 1
