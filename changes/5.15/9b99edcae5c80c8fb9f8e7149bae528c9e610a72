bpf: Add bpf_get_func_ip helper for tracing programs

Adding bpf_get_func_ip helper for BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING programs,
specifically for all trampoline attach types.

The trampoline's caller IP address is stored in (ctx - 8) address.
so there's no reason to actually call the helper, but rather fixup
the call instruction and return [ctx - 8] value directly.
