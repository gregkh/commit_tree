ASoC: SOF: Intel: make DMI L1 selection more robust

Exposing the DMI L1 configuration as a kernel Kconfig option was in
hindsight a really bad idea. It led to several errors reported by
distributions which selected it by mistake.

The Kconfig is now replaced with a kernel parameter. Since DMI L1
entry is incompatible with pause on a capture stream, the latter is
disabled when the kernel parameter is set.

Experimental results show an increased residency in higher C states
and a significant decrease of system power consumption for "work from
home" usages such as VoIP calls.
