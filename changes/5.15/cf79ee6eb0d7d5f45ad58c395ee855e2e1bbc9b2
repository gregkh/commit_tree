staging/rtl8192e: Remove all strcpy() uses

strcpy() performs no bounds checking on the destination buffer. This
could result in linear overflows beyond the end of the buffer, leading
to all kinds of misbehaviors. The safe replacement is strscpy().

It is also dangerous a strcpy() followed by a strcat(). In this case,
refactor the code using scnprintf() and avoid this combination.
