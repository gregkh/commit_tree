fddi: use ndo_siocdevprivate

The skfddi driver has a private ioctl and passes the data correctly
through ifr_data, but the use of a pointer in s_skfp_ioctl is
broken in compat mode.

Change the driver to use ndo_siocdevprivate and disallow calling
it in compat mode until a conversion handler is added.
