afs: Fix updating of i_blocks on file/dir extension

When an afs file or directory is modified locally such that the total file
size is extended, i_blocks needs to be recalculated too.

Fix this by making afs_write_end() and afs_edit_dir_add() call
afs_set_i_size() rather than setting inode->i_size directly as that also
recalculates inode->i_blocks.

This can be tested by creating and writing into directories and files and
then examining them with du.  Without this change, directories show a 4
blocks (they start out at 2048 bytes) and files show 0 blocks; with this
change, they should show a number of blocks proportional to the file size
rounded up to 1024.
