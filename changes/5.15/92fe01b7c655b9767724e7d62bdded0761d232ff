powerpc/pseries/iommu: Check if the default window in use before removing it

At the moment this check is performed after we remove the default window
which is late and disallows to revert whatever changes enable_ddw()
has made to DMA windows.

This moves the check and error exit before removing the window.

This raised the message severity from "debug" to "warning" as this
should not happen in practice and cannot be triggered by the userspace.
