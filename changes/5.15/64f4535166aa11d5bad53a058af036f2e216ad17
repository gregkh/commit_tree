tools headers UAPI: Sync files changed by new process_mrelease syscall and the removal of some compat entry points

To pick the changes in these csets:

  59ab844eed9c6b01 ("compat: remove some compat entry points")
  dce49103962840dd ("mm: wire up syscall process_mrelease")
  b48c7236b13cb5ef ("exit/bdflush: Remove the deprecated bdflush system call")

That add support for this new syscall in tools such as 'perf trace'.

For instance, this is now possible:

  # perf trace -v -e process_mrelease
  event qualifier tracepoint filter: (common_pid != 19351 && common_pid != 9112) && (id == 448)
  ^C#

That is the filter expression attached to the raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}
tracepoints.

  $ grep process_mrelease tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
  448    common  process_mrelease            sys_process_mrelease
  $

This addresses these perf build warnings:
