net/mlx5e: Prohibit inner indir TIRs in IPoIB

TIR's rx_hash_field_selector_inner can be enabled only when
tunneled_offload_en = 1. tunneled_offload_en is filled according to the
tunneled_offload_en field in struct mlx5e_params, which is false in the
IPoIB profile. On the other hand, the IPoIB profile passes inner_ttc =
true to mlx5e_create_indirect_tirs, which potentially allows the latter
function to attempt to create inner indirect TIRs without having
tunneled_offload_en set.

This commit prohibits this behavior by passing inner_ttc = false to
mlx5e_create_indirect_tirs. The latter function won't attempt to create
inner indirect TIRs.

As inner indirect TIRs are not created in the IPoIB profile (this commit
blocks it explicitly, and even before they would have failed to be
created), the call to mlx5e_create_inner_ttc_table in
mlx5i_create_flow_steering is a no-op and can be removed.
