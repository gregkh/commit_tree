nvme-fc: avoid race between time out and tear down

To avoid race between time out and tear down, in tear down process,
first we quiesce the queue, and then delete the timer and cancel
the time out work for the queue.

This patch merges the admin and io sync ops into the queue teardown logic
as shown in the RDMA patch 3017013dcc "nvme-rdma: avoid race between time
out and tear down". There is no teardown_lock in nvme-fc.
