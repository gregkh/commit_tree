bonding: use siocdevprivate

The bonding driver supports two command codes for each operation: one
in the SIOCDEVPRIVATE range and another one with the same definition
but a unique command code.

Only the second set currently works in compat mode, as the ifr_data
expansion overwrites part of the ifr_slave field.

Move the private ones into ndo_siocdevprivate and change the
implementation to call the other function.  This makes both version
work correctly.
