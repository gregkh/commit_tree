staging: r8188eu: Remove unused static inline functions in rtw_recv.h

After commit 987219ad34a6 ("staging: r8188eu: remove lines from Makefile
that silence build warnings"), clang warns several times:

2 warnings generated.

The functions that these warnings come from are not used or are called
from functions that are not used so just remove them to remove the
warnings.
