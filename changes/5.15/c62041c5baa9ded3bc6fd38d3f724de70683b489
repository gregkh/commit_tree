sfc: Export fibre-specific supported link modes

The 1/10GbaseT modes were set up for cards with SFP+ cages in
3497ed8c852a5 ("sfc: report supported link speeds on SFP connections").
10GbaseT was likely used since no 10G fibre mode existed.

The missing fibre modes for 1/10G were added to ethtool.h in 5711a9822144
("net: ethtool: add support for 1000BaseX and missing 10G link modes")
shortly thereafter.

The user guide available at https://support-nic.xilinx.com/wp/drivers
lists support for the following cable and transceiver types in section 2.9:
- QSFP28 100G Direct Attach Cables
- QSFP28 100G SR Optical Transceivers (with SR4 modules listed)
- SFP28 25G Direct Attach Cables
- SFP28 25G SR Optical Transceivers
- QSFP+ 40G Direct Attach Cables
- QSFP+ 40G Active Optical Cables
- QSFP+ 40G SR4 Optical Transceivers
- QSFP+ to SFP+ Breakout Direct Attach Cables
- QSFP+ to SFP+ Breakout Active Optical Cables
- SFP+ 10G Direct Attach Cables
- SFP+ 10G SR Optical Transceivers
- SFP+ 10G LR Optical Transceivers
- SFP 1000BASE‐T Transceivers
- 1G Optical Transceivers
(From user guide issue 28. Issue 16 which also includes older cards like
SFN5xxx/SFN6xxx has matching lists for 1/10/40G transceiver types.)

Regarding SFP+ 10GBASE‐T transceivers the latest guide says:
"Solarflare adapters do not support 10GBASE‐T transceiver modules."

Tested using SFN5122F-R7 (with 2 SFP+ ports). Supported link modes do not change
depending on module used (tested with 1000BASE-T, 1000BASE-BX10, 10GBASE-LR).
