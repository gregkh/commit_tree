locking/atomic: remove ARCH_ATOMIC remanants

Now that gen-atomic-fallback.sh is only used to generate the arch_*
fallbacks, we don't need to also generate the non-arch_* forms, and can
removethe infrastructure this needed.

There is no change to any of the generated headers as a result of this
patch.
