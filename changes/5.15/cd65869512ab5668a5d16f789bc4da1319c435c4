io_uring: use iov_iter state save/restore helpers

Get rid of the need to do re-expand and revert on an iterator when we
encounter a short IO, or failure that warrants a retry. Use the new
state save/restore helpers instead.

We keep the iov_iter_state persistent across retries, if we need to
restart the read or write operation. If there's a pending retry, the
operation will always exit with the state correctly saved.
