drm/amd/display: Require immediate flip support for DCN3.1 planes

[Why]
Immediate flip can be enabled dynamically and has higher BW requirements
when validating which voltage mode to use.

If we validate when it's not set then potentially DCFCLK will be too low
and we will underflow.

[How]
DM always requires support so always require it as part of DML input
parameters.

This can't be enabled unconditionally on older ASIC because it blocks
some expected modes so only target DCN3.1 for now.
