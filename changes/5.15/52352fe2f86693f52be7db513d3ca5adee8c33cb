drm/msm/dp: use dp_ctrl_off_link_stream during PHY compliance test run

DP cable should always connect to DPU during the entire PHY compliance
testing run. Since DP PHY compliance test is executed at irq_hpd event
context, dp_ctrl_off_link_stream() should be used instead of dp_ctrl_off().
dp_ctrl_off() is used for unplug event which is triggered when DP cable is
dis connected.

Changes in V2:
-- add fixes statement
