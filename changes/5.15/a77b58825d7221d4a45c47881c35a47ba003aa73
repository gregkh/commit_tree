drm/panfrost: Use u64 for size in lock_region

Mali virtual addresses are 48-bit. Use a u64 instead of size_t to ensure
we can express the "lock everything" condition as ~0ULL without
overflow. This code was silently broken on any platform where a size_t
is less than 48-bits; in particular, it was broken on 32-bit armv7
platforms which remain in use with panfrost. (Mainly RK3288)
