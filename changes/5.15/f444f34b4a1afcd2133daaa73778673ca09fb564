dt-bindings: serial: 8250: Add Exar compatibles

The Intel IXP425 Vulcan board has an Exar XR16L2551 8250-compatible.
It works like an 8250 but it is always good to specify exactly which
component we are using. This allows us to specify:

compatible = "exar,xr16l2551", "ns8250";

Put in some sibling Exar serial compatibles while we're at it.
