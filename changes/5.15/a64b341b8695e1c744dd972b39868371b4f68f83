sctp: fix the processing for COOKIE_ECHO chunk

1. In closed state: in sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce():

  When asoc is NULL, making packet for abort will use chunk's vtag
  in sctp_ootb_pkt_new(). But when asoc exists, vtag from the chunk
  should be verified before using peer.i.init_tag to make packet
  for abort in sctp_ootb_pkt_new(), and just discard it if vtag is
  not correct.

2. In the other states: in sctp_sf_do_5_2_4_dupcook():

  asoc always exists, but duplicate cookie_echo's vtag will be
  handled by sctp_tietags_compare() and then take actions, so before
  that we only verify the vtag for the abort sent for invalid chunk
  length.
