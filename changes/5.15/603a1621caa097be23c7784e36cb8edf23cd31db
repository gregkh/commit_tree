mwifiex: avoid null-pointer-subtraction warning

clang complains about some NULL pointer arithmetic in this driver:

drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/sta_tx.c:65:59: error: performing pointer subtraction with a null pointer has undefined behavior [-Werror,-Wnull-pointer-subtraction]
        pad = ((void *)skb->data - (sizeof(*local_tx_pd) + hroom)-
                                                                 ^
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/uap_txrx.c:478:53: error: performing pointer subtraction with a null pointer has undefined behavior [-Werror,-Wnull-pointer-subtraction]
        pad = ((void *)skb->data - (sizeof(*txpd) + hroom) - NULL) &

Rework that expression to do the same thing using a uintptr_t.
