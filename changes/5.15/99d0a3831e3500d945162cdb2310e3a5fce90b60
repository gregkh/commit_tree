bpf: Move BPF_MAP_TYPE for INODE_STORAGE and TASK_STORAGE outside of CONFIG_NET

bpf_types.h has BPF_MAP_TYPE_INODE_STORAGE and BPF_MAP_TYPE_TASK_STORAGE
declared inside #ifdef CONFIG_NET although they are built regardless of
CONFIG_NET. So, when CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL && !CONFIG_NET, they are built
without the declarations leading to spurious build failures and not
registered to bpf_map_types making them unavailable.

Fix it by moving the BPF_MAP_TYPE for the two map types outside of
CONFIG_NET.
