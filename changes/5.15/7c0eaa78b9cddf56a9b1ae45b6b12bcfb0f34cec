s390/sclp: reserve memory occupied by sclp early buffer

The memory block occupied by the SCLP early buffer that is allocated
by the decompressor and then handed over to the decompressed kernel,
must be reserved to prevent it from being reused for other purposes.
This is necessary because the SCLP early buffer is still in use
during kernel initialization.
