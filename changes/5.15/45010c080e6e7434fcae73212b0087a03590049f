iwlwifi: pnvm: Fix a memory leak in 'iwl_pnvm_get_from_fs()'

A firmware is requested but never released in this function. This leads to
a memory leak in the normal execution path.

Add the missing 'release_firmware()' call.
Also introduce a temp variable (new_len) in order to keep the value of
'pnvm->size' after the firmware has been released.
