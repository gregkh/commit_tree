xfs: XLOG_STATE_IOERROR must die

We don't need an iclog state field to tell us the log has been shut
down. We can just check the xlog_is_shutdown() instead. The avoids
the need to have shutdown overwrite the current iclog state while
being active used by the log code and so having to ensure that every
iclog state check handles XLOG_STATE_IOERROR appropriately.
