arm64/cpufeature: Optionally disable MTE via command-line

MTE support needs to be optionally disabled in runtime
for HW issue workaround, FW development and some
evaluation works on system resource and performance.

This patch makes two changes:
(1) moves init of tag-allocation bits(ATA/ATA0) to
cpu_enable_mte() as not cached in TLB.

(2) allows ID_AA64PFR1_EL1.MTE to be overridden on
its shadow value by giving "arm64.nomte" on cmdline.

When the feature value is off, ATA and TCF will not set
and the related functionalities are accordingly suppressed.
