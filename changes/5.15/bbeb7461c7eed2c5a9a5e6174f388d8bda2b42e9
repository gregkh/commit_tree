drm/vkms: Use dma-buf mapping from shadow-plane state for composing

Store the shadow-buffer mapping's address in struct vkms_composer and
use the value when composing the output. It's the same value as stored
in the GEM SHMEM BO, but frees the composer code from its dependency
on GEM SHMEM.

Using struct dma_buf_map is how framebuffer access is supposed to be.
The long-term plan is to perform all framebuffer access via struct
dma_buf_map and avoid the details of accessing I/O and system memory.
