KVM: selftests: Refactor help message for -s backing_src

All selftests that support the backing_src option were printing their
own description of the flag and then calling backing_src_help() to dump
the list of available backing sources. Consolidate the flag printing in
backing_src_help() to align indentation, reduce duplicated strings, and
improve consistency across tests.

Note: Passing "-s" to backing_src_help is unnecessary since every test
uses the same flag. However I decided to keep it for code readability
at the call sites.

While here this opportunistically fixes the incorrectly interleaved
printing -x help message and list of backing source types in
dirty_log_perf_test.
