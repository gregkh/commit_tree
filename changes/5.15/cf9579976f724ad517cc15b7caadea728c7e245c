net: mdio: introduce a shutdown method to mdio device drivers

MDIO-attached devices might have interrupts and other things that might
need quiesced when we kexec into a new kernel. Things are even more
creepy when those interrupt lines are shared, and in that case it is
absolutely mandatory to disable all interrupt sources.

Moreover, MDIO devices might be DSA switches, and DSA needs its own
shutdown method to unlink from the DSA master, which is a new
requirement that appeared after commit 2f1e8ea726e9 ("net: dsa: link
interfaces with the DSA master to get rid of lockdep warnings").

So introduce a ->shutdown method in the MDIO device driver structure.
