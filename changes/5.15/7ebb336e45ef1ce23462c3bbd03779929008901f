scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add start + stop bsgs

Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
(EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.

Add two new BSG calls:

 - QL_VND_SC_APP_START: Application will announce its presence to driver
   with this call. Driver will restart all connections to see if remote
   device supports security or not.

 - QL_VND_SC_APP_STOP: Application announces it is in the process of
   exiting. Driver will restart all connections to revert back to
   non-secure. Provided the remote device is willing to allow a non-secure
   connection.
