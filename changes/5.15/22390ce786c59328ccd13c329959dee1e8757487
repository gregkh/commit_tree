ALSA: usb-audio: add Schiit Hel device to quirk table

The Shciit Hel device responds to the ctl message for the mic capture
switch with a timeout of -EPIPE:

	usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1
	usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1
	usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1
	usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1

This seems safe to ignore as the device works properly with the control
message quirk, so add it to the quirk table so all is good.
