f2fs: Kconfig: clean up config options about compression

In fs/f2fs/Kconfig, F2FS_FS_LZ4HC depends on F2FS_FS_LZ4 and F2FS_FS_LZ4
depends on F2FS_FS_COMPRESSION, so no need to make F2FS_FS_LZ4HC depends
on F2FS_FS_COMPRESSION explicitly, remove the redudant "depends on", do
the similar thing for F2FS_FS_LZORLE.

At the same time, it is better to move F2FS_FS_LZORLE next to F2FS_FS_LZO,
it looks like a little more clear when make menuconfig, the location of
"LZO-RLE compression support" is under "LZO compression support" instead
of "F2FS compression feature".

Without this patch:

F2FS compression feature
  LZO compression support
  LZ4 compression support
    LZ4HC compression support
  ZSTD compression support
  LZO-RLE compression support

With this patch:

F2FS compression feature
  LZO compression support
    LZO-RLE compression support
  LZ4 compression support
    LZ4HC compression support
  ZSTD compression support
