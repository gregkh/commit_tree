usb: isp1760: otg control register access

The set/clear of the otg control values is done writing to
two different 16bit registers, however we setup the regmap
width for isp1760/61 to 32bit value bits.

So, just access the clear register address (0x376)as the high
part of the otg control register set (0x374), and write the
values in one go to make sure they get clear/set.
