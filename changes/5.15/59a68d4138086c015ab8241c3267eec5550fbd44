arm64: Mitigate MTE issues with str{n}cmp()

As with strlen(), the patches importing the updated str{n}cmp()
implementations were originally developed and tested before the
advent of CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS, and have subsequently revealed
not to be MTE-safe. Since in-kernel MTE is still a rather niche
case, let it temporarily fall back to the generic C versions for
correctness until we can figure out the best fix.
