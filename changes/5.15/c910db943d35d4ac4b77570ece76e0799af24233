tracing: Dynamically allocate the per-elt hist_elt_data array

Setting the hist_elt_data.field_var_str[] array unconditionally to a
size of SYNTH_FIELD_MAX elements wastes space unnecessarily.  The
actual number of elements needed can be calculated at run-time
instead.

In most cases, this will save a lot of space since it's a per-elt
array which isn't normally close to being full.  It also allows us to
increase SYNTH_FIELD_MAX without worrying about even more wastage when
we do that.
