net: dsa: fix dsa_tree_setup error path

Since the blamed commit, dsa_tree_teardown_switches() was split into two
smaller functions, dsa_tree_teardown_switches and dsa_tree_teardown_ports.

However, the error path of dsa_tree_setup stopped calling dsa_tree_teardown_ports.

Fixes: a57d8c217aad ("net: dsa: flush switchdev workqueue before tearing down CPU/DSA ports")
