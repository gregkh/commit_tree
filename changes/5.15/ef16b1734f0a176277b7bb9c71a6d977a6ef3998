sctp: add vtag check in sctp_sf_do_8_5_1_E_sa

sctp_sf_do_8_5_1_E_sa() is called when processing SHUTDOWN_ACK chunk
in cookie_wait and cookie_echoed state.

The vtag in the chunk's sctphdr should be verified, otherwise, as
later in chunk length check, it may send abort with the existent
asoc's vtag, which can be exploited by one to cook a malicious
chunk to terminate a SCTP asoc.

Note that when fails to verify the vtag from SHUTDOWN-ACK chunk,
SHUTDOWN COMPLETE message will still be sent back to peer, but
with the vtag from SHUTDOWN-ACK chunk, as said in 5) of
rfc4960#section-8.4.

While at it, also remove the unnecessary chunk length check from
sctp_sf_shut_8_4_5(), as it's already done in both places where
it calls sctp_sf_shut_8_4_5().
