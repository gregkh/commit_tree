mm/damon/core-test: fix wrong expectations for 'damon_split_regions_of()'

Kunit test cases for 'damon_split_regions_of()' expects the number of
regions after calling the function will be same to their request
('nr_sub').  However, the requested number is just an upper-limit,
because the function randomly decides the size of each sub-region.

This fixes the wrong expectation.
