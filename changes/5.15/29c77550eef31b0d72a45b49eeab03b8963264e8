perf script: Check session->header.env.arch before using it

When perf.data is not written cleanly, we would like to process existing
data as much as possible (please see f_header.data.size == 0 condition
in perf_session__read_header). However, perf.data with partial data may
crash perf. Specifically, we see crash in 'perf script' for NULL
session->header.env.arch.

Fix this by checking session->header.env.arch before using it to determine
native_arch. Also split the if condition so it is easier to read.

Committer notes:

If it is a pipe, we already assume is a native arch, so no need to check
session->header.env.arch.
