nfc: port100: fix using -ERRNO as command type mask

During probing, the driver tries to get a list (mask) of supported
command types in port100_get_command_type_mask() function.  The value
is u64 and 0 is treated as invalid mask (no commands supported).  The
function however returns also -ERRNO as u64 which will be interpret as
valid command mask.

Return 0 on every error case of port100_get_command_type_mask(), so the
probing will stop.
