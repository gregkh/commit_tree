MIPS: Revert "add support for buggy MT7621S core detection"

This reverts commit 6decd1aad15f56b169217789630a0098b496de0e. CPULAUNCH
register is not set properly by some bootloaders, causing a regression
until a bootloader change is made, which is hard if not impossible on
some embedded devices. Revert the change until a more robust core
detection mechanism that works on MT7621S routers such as Netgear R6220
as well as platforms like Digi EX15 can be made.
