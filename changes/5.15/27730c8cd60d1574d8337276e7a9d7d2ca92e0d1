perf script: Fix PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT support

-F weight in perf script is broken.

  # ./perf mem record
  # ./perf script -F weight
  Samples for 'dummy:HG' event do not have WEIGHT attribute set. Cannot
print 'weight' field.

The sample type, PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT, is an alternative of the
PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT sample type. They share the same space, weight. The
lower 32 bits are exactly the same for both sample type. The higher 32
bits may be different for different architecture. For a new kernel on
x86, the PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT is used. For an old kernel or other
ARCHs, the PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT is used.

With -F weight, current perf script will only check the input string
"weight" with the PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT sample type. Because the commit
ea8d0ed6eae3 ("perf tools: Support PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT") didn't
update the PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT sample type for perf script. For a
new kernel on x86, the check fails.

Use PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_TYPE, which supports both sample types, to
replace PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT
