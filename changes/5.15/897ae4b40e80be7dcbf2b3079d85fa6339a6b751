net/mlx5: Fix rdma aux device on devlink reload

RDMA auxdev parameter registration was skipped for eswitch manager PCI PF.
Due to this when devlink parameter is read, it reads as false in below
code flow.

$ devlink dev reload pci/0000:06:00.0
  devlink_reload()
    mlx5_load_one()
      mlx5_attach_device()
        is_ib_enabled()
          devlink_param_driverinit_value_get()

Due to this, is_ib_enabled() returns false for the RDMA auxiliary
device. This results into a skipping RDMA auxiliary device creation on
reload.

There is no need to check for eswitch manager capability to support RDMA
auxiliary device. Hence, fix it by skipping eswitch manager capability.
