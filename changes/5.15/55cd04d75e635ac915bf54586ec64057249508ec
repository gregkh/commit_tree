ksmbd: fix translation in sid_to_id()

The sid_to_id() functions is relevant when changing ownership of
filesystem objects based on acl information. In this case we need to
first translate the relevant s*ids into k*ids in ksmbd's user namespace
and account for any idmapped mounts. Requesting a change in ownership
requires the inverse translation to be applied when we would report
ownership to userspace. So k*id_from_mnt() must be used here.
