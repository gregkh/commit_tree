net: mscc: ocelot: warn when a PTP IRQ is raised for an unknown skb

When skb_match is NULL, it means we received a PTP IRQ for a timestamp
ID that the kernel has no idea about, since there is no skb in the
timestamping queue with that timestamp ID.

This is a grave error and not something to just "continue" over.
So print a big warning in case this happens.

Also, move the check above ocelot_get_hwtimestamp(), there is no point
in reading the full 64-bit current PTP time if we're not going to do
anything with it anyway for this skb.
