KVM: SVM: call avic_vcpu_load/avic_vcpu_put when enabling/disabling AVIC

Currently it is possible to have the following scenario:

1. AVIC is disabled by svm_refresh_apicv_exec_ctrl
2. svm_vcpu_blocking calls avic_vcpu_put which does nothing
3. svm_vcpu_unblocking enables the AVIC (due to KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE)
   and then calls avic_vcpu_load
4. warning is triggered in avic_vcpu_load since
   AVIC_PHYSICAL_ID_ENTRY_IS_RUNNING_MASK was never cleared

While it is possible to just remove the warning, it seems to be more robust
to fully disable/enable AVIC in svm_refresh_apicv_exec_ctrl by calling the
avic_vcpu_load/avic_vcpu_put
