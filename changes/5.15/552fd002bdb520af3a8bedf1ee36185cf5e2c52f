staging: rtl8188eu: move hal/mac_cfg.c and rename function and array

Move source file hal/mac_cfg.c to the 'core' driver directory, and also
rename its array from array_MAC_REG_8188E to array_MAC_REG, as well as
renaming the function rtl88eu_phy_mac_config to phy_mac_config. Also
modify single call-site for this function to reflect new name.

This file contains no code which touches the adapter's HalData structure,
and is a good candidate for therefore moving out of 'hal'. Also, no
need for these signatures to include the model number as this driver
only supports RTL8188eu.
