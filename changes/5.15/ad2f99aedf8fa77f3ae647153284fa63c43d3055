net: bridge: move bridge ioctls out of .ndo_do_ioctl

Working towards obsoleting the .ndo_do_ioctl operation entirely,
stop passing the SIOCBRADDIF/SIOCBRDELIF device ioctl commands
into this callback.

My first attempt was to add another ndo_siocbr() callback, but
as there is only a single driver that takes these commands and
there is already a hook mechanism to call directly into this
driver, extend this hook instead, and use it for both the
deviceless and the device specific ioctl commands.
