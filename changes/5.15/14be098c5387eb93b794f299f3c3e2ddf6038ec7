powerpc/xive: Add support for IRQ domain hierarchy

This adds handlers to allocate/free IRQs in a domain hierarchy. We
could try to use xive_irq_domain_map() in xive_irq_domain_alloc() but
we rely on xive_irq_alloc_data() to set the IRQ handler data and
duplicating the code is simpler.

xive_irq_free_data() needs to be called when IRQ are freed to clear
the MMIO mappings and free the XIVE handler data, xive_irq_data
structure. This is going to be a problem with MSI domains which we
will address later.
