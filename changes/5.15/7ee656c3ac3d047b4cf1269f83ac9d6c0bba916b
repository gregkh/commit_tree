nbd: remove nbd->destroy_complete

The nbd->destroy_complete pointer is not really needed.  For creating
a device without a specific index we now simplify skip devices marked
NBD_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT as there is not much point to reuse them.
For device creation with a specific index there is no real need to
treat the case of a requested but not finished disconnect different
than any other device that is being shutdown, i.e. we can just return
an error, as a slightly different race window would anyway.
