net/mlx5e: Use shared mappings for restoring from metadata

FTEs are added with mapped metadata which is saved per eswitch.
When uplink reps are bonded and we are in a single FDB mode,
we could fail to find metadata which was stored on one eswitch mapping
but not the other or with a different id.
To resolve this issue use shared mapping between eswitch ports.
We do not have any conflict using a single mapping, for a type,
between the ports.
