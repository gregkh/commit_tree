iwlwifi: mvm: don't use FW key ID in beacon protection

To check beacon protection had a mismatch of the key ID we
currently use the key ID from the firmware, but firmware
side we want to clean up the API to stop reporting this.

Instead, check the IWL_RX_MPDU_STATUS_KEY_VALID bit that
indicates that the firmware used the correct key, and if
that's set but we get invalid MIC/replay use the key ID
from the frame to look up the key and notify mac80211 of
MIC error or replay. Since both keys must have the same
cipher and thus MIC length, we can use either of them to
look up the MIC length.
