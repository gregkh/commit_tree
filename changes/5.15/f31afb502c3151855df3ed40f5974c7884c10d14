watchdog: sbsa: only use 32-bit accessors

SBSA says of the generic watchdog:

  All registers are 32 bits in size and should be accessed using 32-bit
  reads and writes. If an access size other than 32 bits is used then
  the results are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

and for qemu, the implementation will only allow 32-bit accesses
resulting in a synchronous external abort when configuring the watchdog.
Use lo_hi_* accessors rather than a readq/writeq.
