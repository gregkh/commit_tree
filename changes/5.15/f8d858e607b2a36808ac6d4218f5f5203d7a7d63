xfrm: make user policy API complete

>From a userland POV, this API was based on some magic values:
 - dirmask and action were bitfields but meaning of bits
   (XFRM_POL_DEFAULT_*) are not exported;
 - action is confusing, if a bit is set, does it mean drop or accept?

Let's try to simplify this uapi by using explicit field and macros.
