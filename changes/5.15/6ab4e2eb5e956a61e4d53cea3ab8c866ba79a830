mmc: sdhci-pci: Read card detect from ACPI for Intel Merrifield

Intel Merrifield platform had been converted to use ACPI enumeration.
However, the driver missed an update to retrieve card detect GPIO.
Fix it here.

Unfortunately we can't rely on CD GPIO state because there are two
different PCB designs in the wild that are using the opposite card
detection sense and there is no way to distinguish those platforms,
that's why ignore CD GPIO completely and use it only as an event.
