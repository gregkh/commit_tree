scsi: iscsi: Fix set_param() handling

In commit 9e67600ed6b8 ("scsi: iscsi: Fix race condition between login and
sync thread") we meant to add a check where before we call ->set_param() we
make sure the iscsi_cls_connection is bound. The problem is that between
versions 4 and 5 of the patch the deletion of the unchecked set_param()
call was dropped so we ended up with 2 calls. As a result we can still hit
a crash where we access the unbound connection on the first call.

This patch removes that first call.
