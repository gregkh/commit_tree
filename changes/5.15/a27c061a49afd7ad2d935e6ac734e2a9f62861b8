fuse: get rid of fuse_put_super()

The ->put_super callback is called from generic_shutdown_super() in case of
a fully initialized sb.  This is called from kill_***_super(), which is
called from ->kill_sb instances.

Fuse uses ->put_super to destroy the fs specific fuse_mount and drop the
reference to the fuse_conn, while it does the same on each error case
during sb setup.

This patch moves the destruction from fuse_put_super() to
fuse_mount_destroy(), called at the end of all ->kill_sb instances.  A
follup patch will clean up the error paths.
