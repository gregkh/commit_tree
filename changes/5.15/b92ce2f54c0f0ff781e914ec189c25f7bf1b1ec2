dsa: mv88e6xxx: Fix MTU definition

The MTU passed to the DSA driver is the payload size, typically 1500.
However, the switch uses the frame size when applying restrictions.
Adjust the MTU with the size of the Ethernet header and the frame
checksum. The VLAN header also needs to be included when the frame
size it per port, but not when it is global.
