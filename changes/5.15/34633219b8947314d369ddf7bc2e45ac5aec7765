phy: qmp: Provide unique clock names for DP clocks

The USB/DP combo PHY exposes the "qmp_dp_phy_pll_link_clk" and
"qmp_dp_phy_pll_vco_div_clk" clocks, that are consumed by the display
clock controller. But for boards with multiple enabled QMP USB/DP combo
instances the hard coded names collides - and hence only the first
probed device is allowed to register.

Given that clocks are no longer reference globally by name and it's
possible to replace the hard coded names by something unique, but still
user friendly.

The two new clock names are based on dev_name() and results in names
such as "88ee000.phy::link_clk" and "88ee000.phy::vco_div_clk".
