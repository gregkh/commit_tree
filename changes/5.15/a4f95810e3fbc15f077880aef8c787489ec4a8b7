watchdog: bcm2835_wdt: consider system-power-controller property

Until now all Raspberry Pi boards used the power off function of the SoC.
But the Raspberry Pi 400 uses gpio-poweroff for the whole board which
possibly cannot register the poweroff handler because the it's
already registered by this watchdog driver. So consider the
system-power-controller property for registering, which is already
defined in soc/bcm/brcm,bcm2835-pm.txt .
