coresight: syscfg: Initial coresight system configuration

Creates an system management API to allow complex configurations and
features to be programmed into a CoreSight infrastructure.

A feature is defined as a programming set for a device or class of
devices.

A configuration is a set of features across the system that are enabled
for a trace session.

The API will manage system wide configuration, and allow complex
programmed features to be added to individual device instances, and
provide for system wide configuration selection on trace capture
operations.

This patch creates the initial data object and the initial API for
loading configurations and features.
