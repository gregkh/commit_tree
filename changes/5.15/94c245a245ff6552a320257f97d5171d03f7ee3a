KVM: x86: Identify vCPU0 by its vcpu_idx instead of its vCPUs array entry

Use vcpu_idx to identify vCPU0 when updating HyperV's TSC page, which is
shared by all vCPUs and "owned" by vCPU0 (because vCPU0 is the only vCPU
that's guaranteed to exist).  Using kvm_get_vcpu() to find vCPU works,
but it's a rather odd and suboptimal method to check the index of a given
vCPU.

No functional change intended.
