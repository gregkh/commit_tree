net-sysfs: initialize uid and gid before calling net_ns_get_ownership

Currently in net_ns_get_ownership() it may not be able to set uid or gid
if make_kuid or make_kgid returns an invalid value, and an uninit-value
issue can be triggered by this.

This patch is to fix it by initializing the uid and gid before calling
net_ns_get_ownership(), as it does in kobject_get_ownership()
