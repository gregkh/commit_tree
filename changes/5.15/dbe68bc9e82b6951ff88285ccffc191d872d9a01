ARM: dts: at91: sama7g5ek: to not touch slew-rate for SDMMC pins

With commit c709135e576b ("pinctrl: at91-pio4: add support for slew-rate")
and commit cbde6c823bfa ("pinctrl: at91-pio4: Fix slew rate disablement")
the slew-rate is enabled by default for each configured pin. The datasheet
specifies at chapter "Output Driver AC Characteristics" that HSIO
drivers (use in SDMMCx and QSPI0 peripherals), don't have a slewrate
setting but are rather calibrated against an external 1% resistor mounted
on the SDMMCx_CAL or QSPI0_CAL pins. Depending on the target signal
frequency and the external load, it is possible to adjust their target
output impedance. Thus set slew-rate = <0> for SDMMC (QSPI is not enabled
at the moment in device tree).
