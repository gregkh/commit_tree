mm, slub: call deactivate_slab() without disabling irqs

The function is now safe to be called with irqs enabled, so move the calls
outside of irq disabled sections.

When called from ___slab_alloc() -> flush_slab() we have irqs disabled, so to
reenable them before deactivate_slab() we need to open-code flush_slab() in
___slab_alloc() and reenable irqs after modifying the kmem_cache_cpu fields.
But that means a IRQ handler meanwhile might have assigned a new page to
kmem_cache_cpu.page so we have to retry the whole check.

The remaining callers of flush_slab() are the IPI handler which has disabled
irqs anyway, and slub_cpu_dead() which will be dealt with in the following
patch.
