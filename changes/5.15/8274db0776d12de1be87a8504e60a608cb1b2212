Bluetooth: btusb: Remove WAKEUP_DISABLE and add WAKEUP_AUTOSUSPEND for Realtek devices

For the commit of 9e45524a011107a73bc2cdde8370c61e82e93a4d, wakeup is
always disabled for Realtek devices. However, there's the capability
for Realtek devices to apply USB wakeup.

In this commit, remove WAKEUP_DISABLE feature for Realtek devices.
If users would switch wakeup, they should access
"/sys/bus/usb/.../power/wakeup"

In this commit, it also adds the feature as WAKEUP_AUTOSUSPEND
for Realtek devices because it should set do_remote_wakeup on autosuspend.
