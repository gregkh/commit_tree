octeontx2-af: Display all enabled PF VF rsrc_alloc entries.

Currently, we are using a fixed buffer size of length 2048 to display
rsrc_alloc output. As a result a maximum of 2048 characters of
rsrc_alloc output is displayed, which may lead sometimes to display only
partial output. This patch fixes this dependency on max limit of buffer
size and displays all PF VF entries.

Each column of the debugfs entry "rsrc_alloc" uses a fixed width of 12
characters to print the list of LFs of each block for a PF/VF. If the
length of list of LFs of a block exceeds this fixed width then the list
gets truncated and displays only a part of the list. This patch fixes
this by using the maximum possible length of list of LFs among all
blocks of all PFs and VFs entries as the width size.
