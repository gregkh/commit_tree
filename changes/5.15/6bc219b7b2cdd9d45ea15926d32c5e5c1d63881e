mtdblock: Update old JFFS2 mention in Kconfig

JFFS2 can be mounted without 'mtdblock' since
a really, really long time. Some git-log
archaeology shows that in 2006 it was possible
to use 'root=' to mount a JFFS2 rootfs:

  commit e9482b4374e2596e6f3f1ab30c4ea469f4ac6311

      [MTD] Allow alternate JFFS2 mount variant for root filesystem.

      With this patch, "root=mtd3" and "root=mtd:foo" work for a JFFS2 rootfs.

However, there are still plenty of tutorials that mention
mtdblock, so users are still taking this route. Update the Kconfig
to reflect this is no longer needed.
