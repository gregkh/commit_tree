rbtree: Split out the rbtree type definitions into <linux/rbtree_types.h>

So we have this header dependency problem on RT:

 - <linux/rtmutex.h> needs the definition of 'struct rb_root_cached'.
 - <linux/rbtree.h> includes <linux/kernel.h>, which includes <linux/spinlock.h>.

That works nicely for non-RT enabled kernels, but on RT enabled kernels
spinlocks are based on rtmutexes, which creates another circular header
dependency, as <linux/spinlocks.h> will require <linux/rtmutex.h>.

Split out the type definitions and move them into their own header file so
the rtmutex header can include just those.
