usb: gadget: f_uac2: add volume and mute support

This adds bi-directional (host->device, device->host)
volume/mute support to the f_uac2 driver by adding
Feature Units and interrupt endpoint.

Currently only master channel is supported.

Volume and mute are configurable through configfs,
by default volume has -100..0 dB range with 1 dB step.

Similar to existing flexible endpoints configuration,
Feature Unit won't be added to the topology if both
mute and volume are not enabled, also interrupt endpoint
isn't added to the device if no feature unit is present
