riscv: Enable Undefined Behavior Sanitizer UBSAN

Select ARCH_HAS_UBSAN_SANITIZE_ALL in order to allow the user to
enable CONFIG_UBSAN_SANITIZE_ALL and instrument the entire kernel for
ubsan checks.

VDSO is excluded because its build doesn't include the
__ubsan_handle_*() functions from lib/ubsan.c, and the VDSO has no
sane way to report errors even if it has definitions of these functions.

Passed lib/test_ubsan.c test.
