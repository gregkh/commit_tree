scsi: ufs: Fix memory corruption by ufshcd_read_desc_param()

If param_offset > buff_len then the memcpy() statement in
ufshcd_read_desc_param() corrupts memory since it copies 256 + buff_len -
param_offset bytes into a buffer with size buff_len.  Since param_offset <
256 this results in writing past the bound of the output buffer.
