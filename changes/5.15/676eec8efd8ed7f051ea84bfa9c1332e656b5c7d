net: ipa: always inline ipa_aggr_granularity_val()

It isn't required, but all callers of ipa_aggr_granularity_val()
pass a constant value (IPA_AGGR_GRANULARITY) as the usec argument.
Two of those callers are in ipa_validate_build(), with the result
being passed to BUILD_BUG_ON().

Evidently the "sparc64-linux-gcc" compiler (at least) doesn't always
inline ipa_aggr_granularity_val(), so the result of the function is
not constant at compile time, and that leads to build errors.

Define the function with the __always_inline attribute to avoid the
errors.  We can see by inspection that the value passed is never
zero, so we can just remove its WARN_ON() call.
