drm/msm: Track "seqno" fences by idr

Previously the (non-fd) fence returned from submit ioctl was a raw
seqno, which is scoped to the ring.  But from UABI standpoint, the
ioctls related to seqno fences all specify a submitqueue.  We can
take advantage of that to replace the seqno fences with a cyclic idr
handle.

This is in preperation for moving to drm scheduler, at which point
the submit ioctl will return after queuing the submit job to the
scheduler, but before the submit is written into the ring (and
therefore before a ring seqno has been assigned).  Which means we
need to replace the dma_fence that userspace may need to wait on
with a scheduler fence.
