f2fs: remove allow_outplace_dio()

We can just check f2fs_lfs_mode() directly.  The block_unaligned_IO()
check is redundant because in LFS mode, f2fs doesn't do direct I/O
writes that aren't block-aligned (due to f2fs_force_buffered_io()
returning true in this case, triggering the fallback to buffered I/O).
