s390/pci: fix misleading rc in clp_set_pci_fn()

Currently clp_set_pci_fn() always returns 0 as long as the CLP request
itself succeeds even if the operation itself returns a response code
other than CLP_RC_OK or CLP_RC_SETPCIFN_ALRDY. This is highly misleading
because calling code assumes that a zero rc means that the operation was
successful.

Fix this by returning the response code or cc on failure with the
exception of the special handling for CLP_RC_SETPCIFN_ALRDY. Also let's
not assume that the returned function handle for CLP_RC_SETPCIFN_ALRDY
is 0, we don't need it anyway.
