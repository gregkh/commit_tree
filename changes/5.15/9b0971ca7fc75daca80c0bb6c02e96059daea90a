KVM: SEV-ES: fix another issue with string I/O VMGEXITs

If the guest requests string I/O from the hypervisor via VMGEXIT,
SW_EXITINFO2 will contain the REP count.  However, sev_es_string_io
was incorrectly treating it as the size of the GHCB buffer in
bytes.

This fixes the "outsw" test in the experimental SEV tests of
kvm-unit-tests.
