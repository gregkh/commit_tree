powerpc/64: warn if local irqs are enabled in NMI or hardirq context

This can help catch bugs such as the one fixed by the previous change
to prevent _exception() from enabling irqs.

ppc32 could have a similar warning but it has no good config option to
debug this stuff (the test may be overkill to add for production
kernels).
