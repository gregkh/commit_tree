clk: Skip clk provider registration when np is NULL

commit 6579c8d97ad7 ("clk: Mark fwnodes when their clock provider is added")
revealed that clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c driver calls
devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider(), with a NULL dev->of_node, which resulted in a
NULL pointer dereference in of_clk_add_hw_provider() when calling
fwnode_dev_initialized().

Returning 0 is reducing the if conditions in driver code and is being
consistent with the CONFIG_OF=n inline stub that returns 0 when CONFIG_OF
is disabled. The downside is that drivers will maybe register clkdev lookups
when they don't need to and waste some memory.
