ARM: iop32x: disable N2100 PCI parity reporting

On the N2100, instead of just marking the r8169 chips as having
broken_parity_status, disable parity error reporting for them entirely.

This was the only relevant place that set broken_parity_status, so we no
longer need to check for it in the r8169 error interrupt handler.
