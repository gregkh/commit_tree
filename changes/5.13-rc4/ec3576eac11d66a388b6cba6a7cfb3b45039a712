Documentation: firmware-guide: gpio-properties: Add note to SPI CS case

Historically ACPI has no means of the GPIO polarity and thus
the SPISerialBus() resource defines it on the per-chip basis.
In order to avoid an ambiguity, the GPIO polarity is considered
being always Active High.

Add note about this to the respective documentation file.
