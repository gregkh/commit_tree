powerpc/prom: Mark identical_pvr_fixup as __init

If identical_pvr_fixup() is not inlined, there are two modpost warnings:

WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0x54e8): Section mismatch in reference
from the function identical_pvr_fixup() to the function
.init.text:of_get_flat_dt_prop()
The function identical_pvr_fixup() references
the function __init of_get_flat_dt_prop().
This is often because identical_pvr_fixup lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of of_get_flat_dt_prop is wrong.

WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0x551c): Section mismatch in reference
from the function identical_pvr_fixup() to the function
.init.text:identify_cpu()
The function identical_pvr_fixup() references
the function __init identify_cpu().
This is often because identical_pvr_fixup lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of identify_cpu is wrong.

identical_pvr_fixup() calls two functions marked as __init and is only
called by a function marked as __init so it should be marked as __init
as well. At the same time, remove the inline keywork as it is not
necessary to inline this function. The compiler is still free to do so
if it feels it is worthwhile since commit 889b3c1245de ("compiler:
remove CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING entirely").

Fixes: 14b3d926a22b ("[POWERPC] 4xx: update 440EP(x)/440GR(x) identical PVR issue workaround")
