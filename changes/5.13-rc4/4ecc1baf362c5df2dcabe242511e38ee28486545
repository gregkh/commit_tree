tcp: convert elligible sysctls to u8

Many tcp sysctls are either bools or small ints that can fit into u8.

Reducing space taken by sysctls can save few cache line misses
when sending/receiving data while cpu caches are empty,
for example after cpu idle period.

This is hard to measure with typical network performance tests,
but after this patch, struct netns_ipv4 has shrunk
by three cache lines.
