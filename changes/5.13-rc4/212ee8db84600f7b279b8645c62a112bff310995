drm/bridge/analogix/anx78xx: Cleanup on error in anx78xx_bridge_attach()

Just another issue I noticed while correcting usages of
drm_dp_aux_init()/drm_dp_aux_register() around the tree. If any of the
steps in anx78xx_bridge_attach() fail, we end up leaking resources. So,
let's fix that (and fix leaking a DP AUX adapter in the process) by
unrolling on errors.
