erofs: don't use erofs_map_blocks() any more

Currently, erofs_map_blocks() will be called only from
erofs_{bmap, read_raw_page} which are all for uncompressed files.
So, the compression branch in erofs_map_blocks() is pointless. Let's
remove it and use erofs_map_blocks_flatmode() directly. Also update
related comments.
