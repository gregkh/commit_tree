drm/amd/pm: revise two names of sensor values for vangogh

This patch is to revise two names of  sensor values for vangogh.
New smu metrics table is supported by new pmfw
(from version 4.63.36.00 ), it includes two parts, one part is
the current smu metrics table data and the other part is the
average smu metrics table data. The hwmon will read the current gfxclk
and mclk from the current smu metrics table data.
