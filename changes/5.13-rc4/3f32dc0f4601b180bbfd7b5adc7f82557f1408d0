IB/core: Drop WARN_ON() from ib_umem_find_best_pgsz()

The WARN_ON() issued as part of ib_umem_find_best_pgsz() blocked cases
when only page sizes larger than PAGE_SIZE were set, drop it to enable
those cases.

In addition, there is no need to have a specific check for zero
pgsz_bitmap, the function will do its job and return 0 at the end if
nothing match will be found.
