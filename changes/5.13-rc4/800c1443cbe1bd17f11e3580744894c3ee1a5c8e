ice: remove unnecessary duplicated AQ command flag setting

Commit a012dca9f7a2 ("ice: add ethtool -m support for reading i2c eeprom
modules") unnecessarily added the ICE_AQ_FLAG_BUF flag to the descriptor
when sending the indirect Read/Write SFF EEPROM AQ command. The flag is
already added later in the code flow for all indirect AQ commands, i.e.
commands that provide an additional data buffer.
