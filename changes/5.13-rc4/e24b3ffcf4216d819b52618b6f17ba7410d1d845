kbuild: collect minimum tool versions into scripts/min-tool-version.sh

The kernel build uses various tools, many of which are provided by the
same software suite, for example, LLVM and Binutils.

When you raise the minimum version of Clang/LLVM, you need to update
clang_min_version in scripts/cc-version.sh and also lld_min_version in
scripts/ld-version.sh.

Kbuild can handle CC=clang and LD=ld.lld independently, but it does not
make much sense to maintain their versions separately.

Let's create a central place of minimum tool versions so you do not need
to touch multiple files. scripts/min-tool-version.sh prints the minimum
version of the given tool.
