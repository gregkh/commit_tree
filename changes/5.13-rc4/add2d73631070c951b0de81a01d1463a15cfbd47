net: set initial device refcount to 1

When adding CONFIG_PCPU_DEV_REFCNT, I forgot that the
initial net device refcount was 0.

When CONFIG_PCPU_DEV_REFCNT is not set, this means
the first dev_hold() triggers an illegal refcount
operation (addition on 0)

refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0x128/0x1a4

Fix is to change initial (and final) refcount to be 1.

Also add a missing kerneldoc piece, as reported by
Stephen Rothwell.
