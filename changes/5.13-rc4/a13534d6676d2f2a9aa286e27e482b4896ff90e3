selftests: kvm: fix potential issue with ELF loading

vm_vaddr_alloc() sets up GVA to GPA mapping page by page; therefore, GPAs
may not be continuous if same memslot is used for data and page table allocation.

kvm_vm_elf_load() however expects a continuous range of HVAs (and thus GPAs)
because it does not try to read file data page by page.  Fix this mismatch
by allocating memory in one step.
