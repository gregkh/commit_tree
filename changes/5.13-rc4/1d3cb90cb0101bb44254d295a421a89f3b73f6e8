igb: Add double-check MTA_REGISTER for i210 and i211

Add new function which checks MTA_REGISTER if its filled correctly.
If not then writes again to same register.
There is possibility that i210 and i211 could not accept
MTA_REGISTER settings, specially when you add and remove
many of multicast addresses in short time.
Without this patch there is possibility that multicast settings will be
not always set correctly in hardware.
