selftests/bpf: Fix maybe-uninitialized warning in xdpxceiver test

xsk_ring_prod__reserve() doesn't necessarily set idx in some conditions, so
from static analysis point of view compiler is right about the problems like:

In file included from xdpxceiver.c:92:
xdpxceiver.c: In function ‘xsk_populate_fill_ring’:
/data/users/andriin/linux/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/tools/include/bpf/xsk.h:119:20: warning: ‘idx’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  return &addrs[idx & fill->mask];
                ~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~
xdpxceiver.c:300:6: note: ‘idx’ was declared here
  u32 idx;
      ^~~
xdpxceiver.c: In function ‘tx_only’:
xdpxceiver.c:596:30: warning: ‘idx’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   struct xdp_desc *tx_desc = xsk_ring_prod__tx_desc(&xsk->tx, idx + i);
                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix two warnings reported by compiler by pre-initializing variable.
