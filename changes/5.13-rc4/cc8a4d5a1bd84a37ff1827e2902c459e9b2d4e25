drm/msm: Avoid mutex in shrinker_count()

When the system is under heavy memory pressure, we can end up with lots
of concurrent calls into the shrinker.  Keeping a running tab on what we
can shrink avoids grabbing a lock in shrinker->count(), and avoids
shrinker->scan() getting called when not profitable.

Also, we can keep purged objects in their own list to avoid re-traversing
them to help cut down time in the critical section further.
