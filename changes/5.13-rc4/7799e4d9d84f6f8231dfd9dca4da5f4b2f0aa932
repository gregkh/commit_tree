bpf: Import syscall arg documentation

These descriptions are present in the man-pages project from the
original submissions around 2015-2016. Import them so that they can be
kept up to date as developers extend the bpf syscall commands.

These descriptions follow the pattern used by scripts/bpf_helpers_doc.py
so that we can take advantage of the parser to generate more up-to-date
man page writing based upon these headers.

Some minor wording adjustments were made to make the descriptions
more consistent for the description / return format.
