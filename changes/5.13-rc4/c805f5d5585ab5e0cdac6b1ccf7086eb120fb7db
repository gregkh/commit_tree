KVM: nVMX: Defer the MMU reload to the normal path on an EPTP switch

Defer reloading the MMU after a EPTP successful EPTP switch.  The VMFUNC
instruction itself is executed in the previous EPTP context, any side
effects, e.g. updating RIP, should occur in the old context.  Practically
speaking, this bug is benign as VMX doesn't touch the MMU when skipping
an emulated instruction, nor does queuing a single-step #DB.  No other
post-switch side effects exist.
