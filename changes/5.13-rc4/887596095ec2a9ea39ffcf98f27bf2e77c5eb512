bpf: Clean up sockmap related Kconfigs

As suggested by John, clean up sockmap related Kconfigs:

Reduce the scope of CONFIG_BPF_STREAM_PARSER down to TCP stream
parser, to reflect its name.

Make the rest sockmap code simply depend on CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL
and CONFIG_INET, the latter is still needed at this point because
of TCP/UDP proto update. And leave CONFIG_NET_SOCK_MSG untouched,
as it is used by non-sockmap cases.
