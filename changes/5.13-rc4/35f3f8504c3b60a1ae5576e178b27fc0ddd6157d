spi: Switch to signed types for *_native_cs SPI controller fields

While fixing undefined behaviour the commit f60d7270c8a3 ("spi: Avoid
undefined behaviour when counting unused native CSs") missed the case
when all CSs are GPIOs and thus unused_native_cs will be evaluated to
-1 in unsigned representation. This will falsely trigger a condition
in the spi_get_gpio_descs().

Switch to signed types for *_native_cs SPI controller fields to fix above.
