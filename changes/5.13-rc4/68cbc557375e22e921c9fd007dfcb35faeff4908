ASoC: soc-pcm: add soc_pcm_update_symmetry()

Current soc-pcm has soc_pcm_has_symmetry() and using it as

	if (soc_pcm_has_symmetry(substream))
		substream->runtime->hw.info |= SNDRV_PCM_INFO_JOINT_DUPLEX;

We want to share same operation as same function.
This patch adds soc_pcm_update_symmetry() and pack above code in
one function.
