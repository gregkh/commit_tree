firmware: arm_scpi: Prevent the ternary sign expansion bug

How the type promotion works in ternary expressions is a bit tricky.
The problem is that scpi_clk_get_val() returns longs, "ret" is a int
which holds a negative error code, and le32_to_cpu() is an unsigned int.
We want the negative error code to be cast to a negative long.  But
because le32_to_cpu() is an u32 then "ret" is type promoted to u32 and
becomes a high positive and then it is promoted to long and it is still
a high positive value.

Fix this by getting rid of the ternary.
