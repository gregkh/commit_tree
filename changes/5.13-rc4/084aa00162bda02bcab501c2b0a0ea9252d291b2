scripts: kernel-doc: fix attribute capture in function parsing

Currently, kernel-doc warns for function prototype parsing on the
presence of attributes "__attribute_const__" and "__flatten" in the
definition.

There are 166 occurrences in ~70 files in the kernel tree for
"__attribute_const__" and 5 occurrences in 4 files for "__flatten".

Out of 166, there are 3 occurrences in three different files with
"__attribute_const__" and a preceding kernel-doc; and, 1 occurrence in
./mm/percpu.c for "__flatten" with a preceding kernel-doc. All other
occurrences have no preceding kernel-doc.

Add support for  "__attribute_const__" and "__flatten" attributes.

A quick evaluation by running 'kernel-doc -none' on kernel-tree reveals
that no additional warning or error has been added or removed by the fix.
