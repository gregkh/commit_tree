usb: dwc2: Allow exit partial power down in urb enqueue

When core is in partial power down state and an external
hub is connected, upper layer sends URB enqueue request,
which results in port reset issue.

Added exit from partial power down state to avoid port
reset issue and process upper layer request correctly.
