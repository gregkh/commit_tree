lockdep: Add lockdep_assert_not_held()

Some kernel functions must be called without holding a specific lock.
Add lockdep_assert_not_held() to be used in these functions to detect
incorrect calls while holding a lock.

lockdep_assert_not_held() provides the opposite functionality of
lockdep_assert_held() which is used to assert calls that require
holding a specific lock.

Incorporates suggestions from Peter Zijlstra to avoid misfires when
lockdep_off() is employed.

The need for lockdep_assert_not_held() came up in a discussion on
ath10k patch. ath10k_drain_tx() and i915_vma_pin_ww() are examples
of functions that can use lockdep_assert_not_held().
