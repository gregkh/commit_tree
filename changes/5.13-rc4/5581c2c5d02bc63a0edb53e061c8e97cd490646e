i2c: cadence: add IRQ check

The driver neglects to check the result of platform_get_irq()'s call and
blithely passes the negative error codes to devm_request_irq() (which
takes *unsigned* IRQ #), causing it to fail with -EINVAL, overriding
an original error code.  Stop calling devm_request_irq() with invalid
IRQ #s.
