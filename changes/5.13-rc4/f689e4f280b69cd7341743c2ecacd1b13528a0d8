tracing: Define new ftrace event "func_repeats"

The event aims to consolidate the function tracing record in the cases
when a single function is called number of times consecutively.

	while (cond)
		do_func();

This may happen in various scenarios (busy waiting for example).
The new ftrace event can be used to show repeated function events with
a single event and save space on the ring buffer
