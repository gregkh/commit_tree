ACPI: sysfs: Get rid of ACPICA message printing

Replace the only ACPI_EXCEPTION() instance in sysfs.c with a
pr_warn() call, drop the _COMPONENT and ACPI_MODULE_NAME()
definitions that are not used any more and drop the
ACPI_SYSTEM_COMPONENT definition that would not be used any
more in a meaningful way after the above changes.
