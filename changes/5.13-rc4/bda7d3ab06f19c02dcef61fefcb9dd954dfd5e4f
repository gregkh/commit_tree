kgdb: fix gcc-11 warnings harder

40cc3a80bb42 ("kgdb: fix gcc-11 warning on indentation") tried to fix up
the gcc-11 complaints in this file by just reformatting the #defines.
That worked for gcc 11.1.0, but in gcc 11.1.1 as shipped by Fedora 34,
the warning came back for one of the #defines.

Fix this up again by putting { } around the if statement, now it is
quiet again.
