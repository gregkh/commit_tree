bpf, doc: Fix some invalid links in bpf_devel_QA.rst

There exist some errors "404 Not Found" when I click the link
of "MAINTAINERS" [1], "samples/bpf/" [2] and "selftests" [3]
in the documentation "HOWTO interact with BPF subsystem" [4].

As Alexei Starovoitov suggested, just remove "MAINTAINERS" and
"samples/bpf/" links and use correct link of "selftests".

  [2] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/samples/bpf/
  [3] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/
