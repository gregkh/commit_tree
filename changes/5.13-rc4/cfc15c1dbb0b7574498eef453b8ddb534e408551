nexthop: Allow reporting activity of nexthop buckets

The kernel periodically checks the idle time of nexthop buckets to
determine if they are idle and can be re-populated with a new nexthop.

When the resilient nexthop group is offloaded to hardware, the kernel
will not see activity on nexthop buckets unless it is reported from
hardware.

Add a function that can be periodically called by device drivers to
report activity on nexthop buckets after querying it from the underlying
device.
