libbpf: Fix signed overflow in ringbuf_process_ring

One of our benchmarks running in (Google-internal) CI pushes data
through the ringbuf faster htan than userspace is able to consume
it. In this case it seems we're actually able to get >INT_MAX entries
in a single ring_buffer__consume() call. ASAN detected that cnt
overflows in this case.

Fix by using 64-bit counter internally and then capping the result to
INT_MAX before converting to the int return type. Do the same for
the ring_buffer__poll().
