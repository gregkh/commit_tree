xfs: inode fork allocation depends on XFS_IFEXTENT flag

Due to confusion on when the XFS_IFEXTENT needs to be set, the
changes in e6a688c33238 ("xfs: initialise attr fork on inode
create") failed to set the flag when initialising the empty
attribute fork at inode creation. Set this flag the same way
xfs_bmap_add_attrfork() does after attry fork allocation.

Fixes: e6a688c33238 ("xfs: initialise attr fork on inode create")
