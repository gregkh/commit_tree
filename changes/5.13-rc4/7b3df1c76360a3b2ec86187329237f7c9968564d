staging: rtl8723bs: remove DBG_COUNTER calls from os_dep/xmit_linux.c

Remove all DBG_COUNTER macro calls from os_dep/xmit_linux.c, as the
corresponding variables are only ever written to and not used. This
makes the code cleaner, and is necessary prior to removing the
DBG_COUNTER definition itself.
