HID: elan: Remove elan_mute_led_get_brigtness()

The led_classdev already contains a cached value of the last set
brightness, the brightness_get callback is only meant for LED drivers
which can read back the actual / current brightness from the hardware.

Since elan_mute_led_get_brigtness() just returns the last set value
it does not add any functionality, so we can just remove it.
