landlock: Set up the security framework and manage credentials

Process's credentials point to a Landlock domain, which is underneath
implemented with a ruleset.  In the following commits, this domain is
used to check and enforce the ptrace and filesystem security policies.
A domain is inherited from a parent to its child the same way a thread
inherits a seccomp policy.
