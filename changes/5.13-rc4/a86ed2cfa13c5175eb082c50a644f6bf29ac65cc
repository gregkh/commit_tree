ptp: Don't print an error if ptp_kvm is not supported

Commit 300bb1fe7671 ("ptp: arm/arm64: Enable ptp_kvm for arm/arm64")
enable ptp_kvm support for ARM platforms and for any ARM platform that
does not support this, the following error message is displayed ...

 ERR KERN fail to initialize ptp_kvm

For platforms that do not support ptp_kvm this error is a bit misleading
and so fix this by only printing this message if the error returned by
kvm_arch_ptp_init() is not -EOPNOTSUPP. Note that -EOPNOTSUPP is only
returned by ARM platforms today if ptp_kvm is not supported.
