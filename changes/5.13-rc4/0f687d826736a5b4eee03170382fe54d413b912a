ASoC: simple-card-utils: Propagate errors on too many links

The DAI counting code doesn't propagate errors when the number of
maximum links is exceeded, which causes subsequent initialization code
to continue to run and that eventually leads to memory corruption with
the code trying to access memory that is out of bounds.

Fix this by propagating errors when the maximum number of links is
reached, which ensures that the driver fails to load and prevents the
memory corruption.
