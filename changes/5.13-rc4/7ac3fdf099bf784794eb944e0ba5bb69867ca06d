rcutorture: Test start_poll_synchronize_rcu() and poll_state_synchronize_rcu()

This commit causes rcutorture to test the new start_poll_synchronize_rcu()
and poll_state_synchronize_rcu() functions.  Because of the difficulty of
determining the nature of a synchronous RCU grace (expedited or not),
the test that insisted that poll_state_synchronize_rcu() detect an
intervening synchronize_rcu() had to be dropped.
