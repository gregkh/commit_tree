MIPS: ralink: mt7621: add memory detection support

mt7621 has the following memory map:
0x0-0x1c000000: lower 448m memory
0x1c000000-0x2000000: peripheral registers
0x20000000-0x2400000: higher 64m memory

detect_memory_region in arch/mips/kernel/setup.c only adds the first
memory region and isn't suitable for 512m memory detection because
it may accidentally read the memory area for peripheral registers.

This commit adds memory detection capability for mt7621:
  1. Add the highmem area when 512m is detected.
  2. Guard memcmp from accessing peripheral registers:
     This only happens when a user decided to change kernel load address
     to 256m or higher address. Since this is a quite unusual case, we
     just skip 512m testing and return 256m as memory size.
