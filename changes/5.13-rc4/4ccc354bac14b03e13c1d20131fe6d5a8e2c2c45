scsi: smartpqi: Update soft reset management for OFA

Cleanup soft reset code for Online Firmware Activation (OFA). OFA allows
controller firmware updates without a reboot.

OFA updates require an on-line controller reset to activate the updated
firmware. There were some missing actions for some of the reset cases. The
controller is first set back to sis mode before returning to pqi mode.
Check to ensure the controller is in sis mode.

Release QRM memory (OFA buffer) on OFA error conditions. Clean up
controller state which can cause a kernel panic upon reboot after an
unsuccessful OFA.
