powerpc: move norestart trap flag to bit 0

Compact the trap flags down to use the low 4 bits of regs.trap.

A few 64e interrupt trap numbers set bit 4. Although they tended to be
trivial so it wasn't a real problem[1], it is not the right thing to do,
and confusing.

[*] E.g., 0x310 hypercall goes to unknown_exception, which prints
    regs->trap directly so 0x310 will appear fine, and only the syscall
    interrupt will test norestart, so it won't be confused by 0x310.
