drm/amd/display: check fb of primary plane

Sometimes the primary plane might not be initialized (yet), which
causes dm_check_crtc_cursor to divide by zero.
Apparently a weird state before a S3-suspend causes the aforementioned
divide-by-zero error when resuming from S3.  This was explained in
bug 212293 on Bugzilla.

To avoid this divide-by-zero error we check if the primary plane's fb
isn't NULL.  If it's NULL the src_w and src_h attributes will be 0,
which would cause a divide-by-zero.

This fixes Bugzilla report 212293
