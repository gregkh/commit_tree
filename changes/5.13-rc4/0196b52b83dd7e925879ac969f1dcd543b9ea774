soundwire: bus: use correct driver name in error messages

None of the existing codec drivers set the sdw_driver.name, but
instead set sdw_driver.driver.name.

This leads to error messages such as
[   23.935355] rt700 sdw:2:25d:700:0: Probe of (null) failed: -19

We could remove this sdw_driver.name if it doesn't have any
purpose. This patch only suggests using the proper indirection.
