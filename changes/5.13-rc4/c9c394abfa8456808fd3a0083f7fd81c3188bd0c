usb: dwc2: Update enter and exit partial power down functions

These are wrapper functions which are calling device or host
enter/exit partial power down functions.

This change is done because we need to separate device and
host partial power down functions as the programming flow
has a lot of difference between host and device. With this
update during partial power down exit driver relies on
backup value of "GOTGCTL_CURMODE_HOST" to determine the
mode of core before entering to PPD.
