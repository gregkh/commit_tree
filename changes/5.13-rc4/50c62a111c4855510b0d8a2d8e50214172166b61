net: qualcomm: rmnet: simplify some byte order logic

In rmnet_map_ipv4_ul_csum_header() and rmnet_map_ipv6_ul_csum_header()
the offset within a packet at which checksumming should commence is
calculated.  This calculation involves byte swapping and a forced type
conversion that makes it hard to understand.

Simplify this by computing the offset in host byte order, then
converting the result when assigning it into the header field.
