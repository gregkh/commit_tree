spi: Don't have controller clean up spi device before driver unbind

When a spi device is unregistered and triggers a driver unbind, the
driver might need to access the spi device. So, don't have the
controller clean up the spi device before the driver is unbound. Clean
up the spi device after the driver is unbound.
