scsi: lpfc: Change wording of invalid pci reset log message

Message 8347 Invalid device found log message is logged when an LPe12000
adapter is installed.  The log message is supposed to indicate an
unsupported pci reset adapter rather than an invalid device.

Change the wording to: Incapable PCI reset device.
