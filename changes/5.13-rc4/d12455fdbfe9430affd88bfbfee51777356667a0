iwlwifi: trans/pcie: defer transport initialisation

In a few PCIe devices we may have to swap out the configuration
after we allocate/initialise some parts of the device because
we only know the correct one after reading some registers. This
causes some things such as the byte-count table allocations to
be incorrect, since the configuration is swapped for one with a
bigger queue size.

Fix this by initialising most of the transport much later, only
after the configuration has finally been determined.
