KVM: selftests: compute correct demand paging size

This is a preparatory commit needed before we can use different kinds of
backing pages for guest memory.

Previously, we used perf_test_args.host_page_size, which is the host's
native page size (commonly 4K). For VM_MEM_SRC_ANONYMOUS this turns out
to be okay, but in a follow-up commit we want to allow using different
kinds of backing memory.

Take VM_MEM_SRC_ANONYMOUS_HUGETLB for example. Without this change, if
we used that backing page type, when we issued a UFFDIO_COPY ioctl we'd
only do so with 4K, rather than the full 2M of a backing hugepage. In
this case, UFFDIO_COPY returns -EINVAL (__mcopy_atomic_hugetlb checks
the size).
