mmc: sdhci-acpi: Add device ID for the AMDI0041 variant of the AMD eMMC controller.

This variant is present on a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 1, which uses an AMD Dali/Athlon Silver 3050e.
The Windows AMD SD Host Controller driver also lists this as a valid device ID.

Adding this device ID makes the internal eMMC storage on the Lenovo accessible.
Consequently this makes Linux installable and usable on it as well.
