Revert "ASoC: rt5645: fix a NULL pointer dereference"

This reverts commit 51dd97d1df5fb9ac58b9b358e63e67b530f6ae21.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

Lots of things seem to be still allocated here and must be properly
cleaned up if an error happens here.
