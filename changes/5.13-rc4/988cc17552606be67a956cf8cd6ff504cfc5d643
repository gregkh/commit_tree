ALSA: usb-audio: Fix implicit sync clearance at stopping stream

The recent endpoint management change for implicit feedback mode added
a clearance of ep->sync_sink (formerly ep->sync_slave) pointer at
snd_usb_endpoint_stop() to assure no leftover for the feedback from
the already stopped capture stream.  This turned out to cause a
regression, however, when full-duplex streams were running and only a
capture was stopped.  Because of the above clearance of ep->sync_sink
pointer, no more feedback is done, hence the playback will stall.

This patch fixes the ep->sync_sink clearance to be done only after all
endpoints are released, for addressing the regression.
