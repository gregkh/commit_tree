crypto: poly1305 - fix poly1305_core_setkey() declaration

gcc-11 points out a mismatch between the declaration and the definition
of poly1305_core_setkey():

lib/crypto/poly1305-donna32.c:13:67: error: argument 2 of type ‘const u8[16]’ {aka ‘const unsigned char[16]’} with mismatched bound [-Werror=array-parameter=]
   13 | void poly1305_core_setkey(struct poly1305_core_key *key, const u8 raw_key[16])
      |                                                          ~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~
In file included from lib/crypto/poly1305-donna32.c:11:
include/crypto/internal/poly1305.h:21:68: note: previously declared as ‘const u8 *’ {aka ‘const unsigned char *’}
   21 | void poly1305_core_setkey(struct poly1305_core_key *key, const u8 *raw_key);

This is harmless in principle, as the calling conventions are the same,
but the more specific prototype allows better type checking in the
caller.

Change the declaration to match the actual function definition.
The poly1305_simd_init() is a bit suspicious here, as it previously
had a 32-byte argument type, but looks like it needs to take the
16-byte POLY1305_BLOCK_SIZE array instead.
