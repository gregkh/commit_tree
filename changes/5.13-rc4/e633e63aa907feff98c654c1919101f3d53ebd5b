torture: Make upper-case-only no-dot no-slash scenario names official

This commit enforces the defacto restriction on scenario names, which is
that they contain neither "/", ".", nor lowercase alphabetic characters.
This restriction avoids collisions between scenario names and the torture
scripting's files and directories.
