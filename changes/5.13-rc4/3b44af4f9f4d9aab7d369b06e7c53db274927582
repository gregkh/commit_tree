serial: 8250_aspeed_vuart: refactor sirq and lpc address setting code

This splits dedicated aspeed_vuart_set_{sirq,lpc_address}() functions
out of the sysfs store functions in preparation for adding DT
properties that will be poking the same registers.  While we're at it,
these functions now provide some basic bounds-checking on their
arguments.
