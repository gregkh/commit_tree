RISC-V: Add kexec support

This patch adds support for kexec on RISC-V. On SMP systems it depends
on HOTPLUG_CPU in order to be able to bring up all harts after kexec.
It also needs a recent OpenSBI version that supports the HSM extension.
I tested it on riscv64 QEMU on both an smp and a non-smp system.
