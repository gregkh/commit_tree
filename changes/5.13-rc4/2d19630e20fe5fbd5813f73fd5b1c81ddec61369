powerpc/signal64: Remove TM ifdefery in middle of if/else block

Both rt_sigreturn() and handle_rt_signal_64() contain TM-related ifdefs
which break-up an if/else block. Provide stubs for the ifdef-guarded TM
functions and remove the need for an ifdef in rt_sigreturn().

Rework the remaining TM ifdef in handle_rt_signal64() similar to
commit f1cf4f93de2f ("powerpc/signal32: Remove ifdefery in middle of if/else").

Unlike in the commit for ppc32, the ifdef can't be removed entirely
since uc_transact in sigframe depends on CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM.
