KVM: selftests: Ignore CPUID.0DH.1H in get_cpuid_test

Similar to CPUID.0DH.0H this entry depends on the vCPU's XCR0 register
and IA32_XSS MSR. Since this test does not control for either before
assigning the vCPU's CPUID, these entries will not necessarily match
the supported CPUID exposed by KVM.

This fixes get_cpuid_test on Cascade Lake CPUs.
