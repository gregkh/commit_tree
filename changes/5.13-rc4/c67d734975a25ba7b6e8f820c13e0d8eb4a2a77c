perf buildid-list: Initialize zstd_data

Fixes segmentation fault when trying to obtain buildid list (e.g. via
perf-archive) from a zstd-compressed `perf.data` file:

```
    $ perf record -z ls
    ...
    [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0,010 MB perf.data, compressed (original 0,001 MB, ratio is 2,190) ]
    $ memcheck perf buildid-list
    ...
