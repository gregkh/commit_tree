NFSD: Extract the svcxdr_init_encode() helper

NFSD initializes an encode xdr_stream only after the RPC layer has
already inserted the RPC Reply header. Thus it behaves differently
than xdr_init_encode does, which assumes the passed-in xdr_buf is
entirely devoid of content.

nfs4proc.c has this server-side stream initialization helper, but
it is visible only to the NFSv4 code. Move this helper to a place
that can be accessed by NFSv2 and NFSv3 server XDR functions.
