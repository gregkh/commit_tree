ath10k: Fix TKIP Michael MIC verification for PCIe

TKIP Michael MIC was not verified properly for PCIe cases since the
validation steps in ieee80211_rx_h_michael_mic_verify() in mac80211 did
not get fully executed due to unexpected flag values in
ieee80211_rx_status.

Fix this by setting the flags property to meet mac80211 expectations for
performing Michael MIC validation there. This fixes CVE-2020-26141. It
does the same as ath10k_htt_rx_proc_rx_ind_hl() for SDIO which passed
MIC verification case. This applies only to QCA6174/QCA9377 PCIe.

Tested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00110-QCARMSWP-1
