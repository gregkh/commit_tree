net/mlx5: Set reformat action when needed for termination rules

For remote mirroring, after the tunnel packets are received, they are
decapsulated and sent to representor, then re-encapsulated and sent
out over another tunnel. So reformat action is set only when the
destination is required to do encapsulation.
