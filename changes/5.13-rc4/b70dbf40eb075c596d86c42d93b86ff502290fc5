thermal/core: Create a helper __thermal_cdev_update() without a lock

There is a need to have a helper function which updates cooling device
state from the governors code. With this change governor can use
lock and unlock while calling helper function. This avoid unnecessary
second time lock/unlock which was in previous solution present in
governor implementation. This new helper function must be called
with mutex 'cdev->lock' hold.

The changed been discussed and part of code presented in thread:
