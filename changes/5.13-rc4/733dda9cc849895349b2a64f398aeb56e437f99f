cpufreq: Kconfig: fix documentation links

User documentation for cpufreq governors and drivers has been moved to
admin-guide; adjust references from Kconfig entries accordingly.

Remove references from undocumented cpufreq drivers, as well as the
'userspace' cpufreq governor, for which no additional details are
provided in the admin-guide text.
