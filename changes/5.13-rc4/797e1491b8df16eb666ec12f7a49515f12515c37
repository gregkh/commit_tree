ARM: configs: Remove REGULATOR_USERSPACE_CONSUMER

The userspace consumer is a development tool, not intended for producton
systems and so should not be present in defconfigs especially not those
for specific machines so is not a good fit for defconfig, remove it from
those defconfigs where it is enabled. No system in mainline actually
instantiates one.
