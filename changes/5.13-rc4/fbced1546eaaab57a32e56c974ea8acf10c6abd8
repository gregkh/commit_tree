powerpc/fadump: Mark fadump_calculate_reserve_size as __init

If fadump_calculate_reserve_size() is not inlined, there is a modpost
warning:

WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0x5196c): Section mismatch in
reference from the function fadump_calculate_reserve_size() to the
function .init.text:parse_crashkernel()
The function fadump_calculate_reserve_size() references
the function __init parse_crashkernel().
This is often because fadump_calculate_reserve_size lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of parse_crashkernel is wrong.

fadump_calculate_reserve_size() calls parse_crashkernel(), which is
marked as __init and fadump_calculate_reserve_size() is called from
within fadump_reserve_mem(), which is also marked as __init.

Mark fadump_calculate_reserve_size() as __init to fix the section
mismatch. Additionally, remove the inline keyword as it is not necessary
to inline this function; the compiler is still free to do so if it feels
it is worthwhile since commit 889b3c1245de ("compiler: remove
CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING entirely").
