bpf: Consolidate shared test timing code

Share the timing / signal interruption logic between different
implementations of PROG_TEST_RUN. There is a change in behaviour
as well. We check the loop exit condition before checking for
pending signals. This resolves an edge case where a signal
arrives during the last iteration. Instead of aborting with
EINTR we return the successful result to user space.
