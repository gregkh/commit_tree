sched/fair: Merge for each idle cpu loop of ILB

Remove the specific case for handling this_cpu outside for_each_cpu() loop
when running ILB. Instead we use for_each_cpu_wrap() and start with the
next cpu after this_cpu so we will continue to finish with this_cpu.

update_nohz_stats() is now used for this_cpu too and will prevents
unnecessary update. We don't need a special case for handling the update of
nohz.next_balance for this_cpu anymore because it is now handled by the
loop like others.
