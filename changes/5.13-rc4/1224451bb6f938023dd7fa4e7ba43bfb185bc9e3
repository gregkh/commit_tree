PM / devfreq: Register devfreq as a cooling device on demand

Currently the default behavior is to manually having the devfreq
backend to register themselves as a devfreq cooling device.

Instead of adding the code in the drivers for the thermal cooling
device registering, let's provide a flag in the devfreq's profile to
tell the common devfreq code to register the newly created devfreq as
a cooling device.
