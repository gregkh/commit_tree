sock: Introduce sk->sk_prot->psock_update_sk_prot()

Currently sockmap calls into each protocol to update the struct
proto and replace it. This certainly won't work when the protocol
is implemented as a module, for example, AF_UNIX.

Introduce a new ops sk->sk_prot->psock_update_sk_prot(), so each
protocol can implement its own way to replace the struct proto.
This also helps get rid of symbol dependencies on CONFIG_INET.
