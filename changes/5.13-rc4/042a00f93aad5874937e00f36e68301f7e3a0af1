IB/{ipoib,hfi1}: Add a timeout handler for rdma_netdev

The current rdma_netdev handling in ipoib hooks the tx_timeout handler,
but prints out a totally useless message that prevents effective debugging
especially when multiple transmit queues are being used.

Add a tx_timeout rdma_netdev hook and implement the callback in the hfi1
to print additional information.

The existing non-helpful message is avoided when the driver has presented
a callback.
