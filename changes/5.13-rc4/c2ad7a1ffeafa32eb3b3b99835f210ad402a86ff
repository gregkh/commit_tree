mm,compaction: let isolate_migratepages_{range,block} return error codes

Currently, isolate_migratepages_{range,block} and their callers use a pfn
== 0 vs pfn != 0 scheme to let the caller know whether there was any error
during isolation.

This does not work as soon as we need to start reporting different error
codes and make sure we pass them down the chain, so they are properly
interpreted by functions like e.g: alloc_contig_range.

Let us rework isolate_migratepages_{range,block} so we can report error
codes.  Since isolate_migratepages_block will stop returning the next pfn
to be scanned, we reuse the cc->migrate_pfn field to keep track of that.
