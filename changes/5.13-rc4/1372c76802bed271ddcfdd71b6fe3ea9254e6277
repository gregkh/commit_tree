ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: turn off display power in resume

Turn off display power at the end of controller resume flow. This is now
possible with the changes done in commit 87fc20e4a0cb ("ASoC: SOF:
Intel: hda: use hdac_ext fine-grained link management"). As codec driver
is able to request the HDA link to be brought back up, the controller
no longer needs to blindly keep display power enabled.
