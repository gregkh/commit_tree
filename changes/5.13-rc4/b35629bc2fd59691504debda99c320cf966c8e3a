tools headers kvm: Sync kvm headers with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  3c0c2ad1ae75963c ("KVM: VMX: Add basic handling of VM-Exit from SGX enclave")

None of them trigger any changes in tooling, this time this is just to silence
these perf build warnings:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h
