Input: cyttsp - drop the phys path

When I test to use the CY8CTMA340 with PostmarketOS I don't have any
problem whatsoever in dropping this phys path, it finds and uses the
touchscreen just as well. I suppose it is because userspace is using
modern input libraries.

I challenge the maintainers to point out a valid and still used
userspace that actually need this. I say we drop it.
