KVM: SVM: Truncate GPR value for DR and CR accesses in !64-bit mode

Drop bits 63:32 on loads/stores to/from DRs and CRs when the vCPU is not
in 64-bit mode.  The APM states bits 63:32 are dropped for both DRs and
CRs:

  In 64-bit mode, the operand size is fixed at 64 bits without the need
  for a REX prefix. In non-64-bit mode, the operand size is fixed at 32
  bits and the upper 32 bits of the destination are forced to 0.
