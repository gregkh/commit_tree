xfs: remove XFS_IFEXTENTS

The in-memory XFS_IFEXTENTS is now only used to check if an inode with
extents still needs the extents to be read into memory before doing
operations that need the extent map.  Add a new xfs_need_iread_extents
helper that returns true for btree format forks that do not have any
entries in the in-memory extent btree, and use that instead of checking
the XFS_IFEXTENTS flag.
