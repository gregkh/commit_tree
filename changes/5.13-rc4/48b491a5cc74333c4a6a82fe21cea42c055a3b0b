net: hsr: fix mac_len checks

Commit 2e9f60932a2c ("net: hsr: check skb can contain struct hsr_ethhdr
in fill_frame_info") added the following which resulted in -EINVAL
always being returned:
	if (skb->mac_len < sizeof(struct hsr_ethhdr))
		return -EINVAL;

mac_len was not being set correctly so this check completely broke
HSR/PRP since it was always 14, not 20.

Set mac_len correctly and modify the mac_len checks to test in the
correct places since sometimes it is legitimately 14.
