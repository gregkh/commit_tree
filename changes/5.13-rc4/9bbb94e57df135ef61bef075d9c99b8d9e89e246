ALSA: hda/realtek: fix static noise on ALC285 Lenovo laptops

Remove a duplicate vendor+subvendor pin fixup entry as one is masking
the other and making it unreachable. Consider the more specific newcomer
as a second chance instead.

The generic entry is made less strict to also match for laptops with
slightly different 0x12 pin configuration. Tested on Lenovo Yoga 6 (AMD)
where 0x12 is 0x40000000.
