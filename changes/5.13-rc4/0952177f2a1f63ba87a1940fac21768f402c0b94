thermal/core/power_allocator: Update once cooling devices when temp is low

The cooling device state change generates an event, also when there is no
need, because temperature is low and device is not throttled. Avoid to
unnecessary update the cooling device which means also not sending event.
The cooling device state has not changed because the temperature is still
below the first activation trip point value, so we can do this.
Add a tracking mechanism to make sure it updates cooling devices only
once - when the temperature dropps below first trip point.
