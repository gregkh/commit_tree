scsi: lpfc: Fix reftag generation sizing errors

An LBA is 8 bytes. The driver generates a reftag from the LBA but the
reftag is 4 bytes. Thus scsi_get_lba() could return a value that exceeds
our reftag size.

Fix by converting all the code to calling the common routine
t10_pi_ref_tag() which returns a u32, thus ensuring a consistent 4byte
value.  Also correct a few code lines that access LBA directly and ensure
64-bit data types are used.
