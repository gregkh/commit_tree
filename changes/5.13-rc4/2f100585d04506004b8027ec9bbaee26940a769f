riscv: Enable generic clockevent broadcast

When percpu-timers are stopped by deep power saving mode, we
need system timer help to broadcast IPI_TIMER.

This is first introduced by broken x86 hardware, where the local apic
timer stops in C3 state. But many other architectures(powerpc, mips,
arm, hexagon, openrisc, sh) have supported the infrastructure to
deal with Power Management issues.
