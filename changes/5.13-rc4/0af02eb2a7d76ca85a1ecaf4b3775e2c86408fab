bpf: Avoid using ARRAY_SIZE on an uninitialized pointer

The cppcheck static code analysis reported the following error:

    if (WARN_ON_ONCE(nest_level > ARRAY_SIZE(bufs->tmp_bufs))) {
                                             ^
ARRAY_SIZE is a macro that expands to sizeofs, so bufs is not actually
dereferenced at runtime, and the code is actually safe. But to keep
things tidy, this patch removes the need for a call to ARRAY_SIZE by
extracting the size of the array into a macro. Cppcheck should no longer
be confused and the code ends up being a bit cleaner.
