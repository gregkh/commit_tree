RDS tcp loopback connection can hang

When TCP is used as transport and a program on the
system connects to RDS port 16385, connection is
accepted but denied per the rules of RDS. However,
RDS connections object is left in the list. Next
loopback connection will select that connection
object as it is at the head of list. The connection
attempt will hang as the connection object is set
to connect over TCP which is not allowed

The issue can be reproduced easily, use rds-ping
to ping a local IP address. After that use any
program like ncat to connect to the same IP
address and port 16385. This will hang so ctrl-c out.
Now try rds-ping, it will hang.

To fix the issue this patch adds checks to disallow
the connection object creation and destroys the
connection object.
