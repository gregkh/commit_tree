bpf, offload: Reorder offload callback 'prepare' in verifier

Commit 4976b718c355 ("bpf: Introduce pseudo_btf_id") switched the
order of resolve_pseudo_ldimm(), in which some pseudo instructions
are rewritten. Thus those rewritten instructions cannot be passed
to driver via 'prepare' offload callback.

Reorder the 'prepare' offload callback to fix it.
