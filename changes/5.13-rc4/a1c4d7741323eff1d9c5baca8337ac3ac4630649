scsi: mpt3sas: Replace unnecessary dynamic allocation with a static one

Dynamic memory allocation isn't actually needed and it can be replaced by
statically allocating memory for struct object io_unit_pg3 with 36
hardcoded entries for its GPIOVal array.

Also, this helps the with ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by
fixing the following warning:

drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_ctl.c: In function ‘BRM_status_show’:
drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_ctl.c:3257:63: warning: array subscript 24 is above array bounds of ‘U16[1]’ {aka ‘short unsigned int[1]’} [-Warray-bounds]
