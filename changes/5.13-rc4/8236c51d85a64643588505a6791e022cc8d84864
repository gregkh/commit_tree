selftests/resctrl: Fix compilation issues for global variables

Reinette reported following compilation issue on Fedora 32, gcc version
10.1.1

/usr/bin/ld: cqm_test.o:<src_dir>/cqm_test.c:22: multiple definition of
`cache_size'; cat_test.o:<src_dir>/cat_test.c:23: first defined here

The same issue is reported for long_mask, cbm_mask, count_of_bits etc
variables as well. Compiler isn't happy because these variables are
defined globally in two .c files namely cqm_test.c and cat_test.c and
the compiler during compilation finds that the variable is already
defined (multiple definition error).

Taking a closer look at the usage of these variables reveals that these
variables are used only locally in functions such as cqm_resctrl_val()
(defined in cqm_test.c) and cat_perf_miss_val() (defined in cat_test.c).
These variables are not shared between those functions. So, there is no
need for these variables to be global. Hence, fix this issue by making
them static variables.
