RDMA/mlx5: Use a union inside mlx5_ib_mr

The struct mlx5_ib_mr can be used for three different things, but only one
at a time:

 - In the user MR cache
 - As a kernel MR
 - As a user MR

Overlay the three things into a single union with the following rules:

 - If the mr is found on the cache_ent->head list then it is a cache MR
   and umem == NULL. The entire union is zero after the MR is removed from
   the cache.

 - If umem != NULL or type == IB_MR_TYPE_USER then it is a user MR.

 - If umem == NULL then it is a kernel MR

This reduces the size of struct mlx5_ib_mr to 552 bytes from 702.

The only place the three flows overlap in the code is during dereg, so add
a few extra checks along there.
