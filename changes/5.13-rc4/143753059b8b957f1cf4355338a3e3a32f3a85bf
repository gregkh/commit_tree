scsi: lpfc: Fix PLOGI ACC to be transmit after REG_LOGIN

The driver is seeing a scenario where PLOGI response was issued and traffic
is arriving while the adapter is still setting up the login context. This
is resulting in errors handling the traffic.

Change the driver so that PLOGI response is sent after the login context
has been setup to avoid the situation.
