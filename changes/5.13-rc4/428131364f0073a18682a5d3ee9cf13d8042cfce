platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Get LPM requirements for Tiger Lake

Platforms that support low power modes (LPM) such as Tiger Lake maintain
requirements for each sub-state that a readable in the PMC. However, unlike
LPM status registers, requirement registers are not memory mapped but are
available from an ACPI _DSM. Collect the requirements for Tiger Lake using
the _DSM method and store in a buffer.
