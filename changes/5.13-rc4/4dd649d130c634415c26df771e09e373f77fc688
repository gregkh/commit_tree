NFC: nfcmrvl: fix kernel-doc syntax in file headers

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
The header for drivers/nfc/nfcmrvl follows this syntax, but the content
inside does not comply with kernel-doc.

This line was probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but is parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warnings from kernel-doc.
For e.g., running scripts/kernel-doc -none on drivers/nfc/nfcmrvl/spi.c
causes warning:
warning: expecting prototype for Marvell NFC(). Prototype was for SPI_WAIT_HANDSHAKE() instead

Provide a simple fix by replacing such occurrences with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
