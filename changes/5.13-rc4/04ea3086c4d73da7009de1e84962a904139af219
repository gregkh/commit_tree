bpf: Prevent writable memory-mapping of read-only ringbuf pages

Only the very first page of BPF ringbuf that contains consumer position
counter is supposed to be mapped as writeable by user-space. Producer
position is read-only and can be modified only by the kernel code. BPF ringbuf
data pages are read-only as well and are not meant to be modified by
user-code to maintain integrity of per-record headers.

This patch allows to map only consumer position page as writeable and
everything else is restricted to be read-only. remap_vmalloc_range()
internally adds VM_DONTEXPAND, so all the established memory mappings can't be
extended, which prevents any future violations through mremap()'ing.
