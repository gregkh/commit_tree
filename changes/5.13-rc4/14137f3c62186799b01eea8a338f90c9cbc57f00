selftests/bpf: Pass all BPF .o's through BPF static linker

Pass all individual BPF object files (generated from progs/*.c) through
`bpftool gen object` command to validate that BPF static linker doesn't
corrupt them.

As an additional sanity checks, validate that passing resulting object files
through linker again results in identical ELF files. Exact same ELF contents
can be guaranteed only after two passes, as after the first pass ELF sections
order changes, and thus .BTF.ext data sections order changes. That, in turn,
means that strings are added into the final BTF string sections in different
order, so .BTF strings data might not be exactly the same. But doing another
round of linking afterwards should result in the identical ELF file, which is
checked with additional `diff` command.
