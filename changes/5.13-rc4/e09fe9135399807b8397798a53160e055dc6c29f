iio: inv_mpu6050: Fully validate gyro and accel scale writes

When setting the gyro or accelerometer scale the inv_mpu6050 driver ignores
the integer part of the value. As a result e.g. all of 0.13309, 1.13309,
12345.13309, ... are accepted as a valid gyro scale and 0.13309 is the
scale that gets set in all those cases.

Make sure to check that the integer part of the scale value is 0 and reject
it otherwise.
