x86/jump_label: Mark arguments as const to satisfy asm constraints

When compiling an external kernel module with `-O0` or `-O1`, the following
compile error may be reported:

    ./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:25:2: error: impossible constraint in ‘asm’
       25 |  asm_volatile_goto("1:"
          |  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It appears that these lower optimization levels prevent GCC from detecting
that the key/branch arguments can be treated as constants and used as
immediate operands. To work around this, explicitly add the `const` label.
