KVM: selftests: simplify setup_demand_paging error handling

A small cleanup. Our caller writes:

  r = setup_demand_paging(...);
  if (r < 0) exit(-r);

Since we're just going to exit anyway, instead of returning an error we
can just re-use TEST_ASSERT. This makes the caller simpler, as well as
the function itself - no need to write our branches, etc.
