ALSA: hda/realtek: Headphone volume is controlled by Front mixer

On some ASUS and MSI machines, the audio codec is alc1220 and the
Headphone is connected to audio mixer 0xf and DAC 0x5, in theory
the Headphone volume is controlled by DAC 0x5 (Heapdhone Playback
Volume), but somehow it is controlled by DAC 0x2 (Front Playback
Volume), maybe this is a defect on the codec alc1220.

Because of this issue, the PA couldn't switch the headphone and
Lineout correctly, If we apply the quirk CLEVO_P950 to those machines,
the Lineout and Headphone will share the audio mixer 0xc and DAC 0x2,
and generate Headphone+LO mixer, then PA could handle them when
switching between them.
