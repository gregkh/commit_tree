KVM: selftests: allow different backing source types

Add an argument which lets us specify a different backing memory type
for the test. The default is just to use anonymous, matching existing
behavior.

This is in preparation for testing UFFD minor faults. For that, we'll
need to use a new backing memory type which is setup with MAP_SHARED.
