KVM: x86/mmu: Document dependency bewteen TDP A/D type and saved bits

Document that SHADOW_ACC_TRACK_SAVED_BITS_SHIFT is directly dependent on
bits 53:52 being used to track the A/D type.

Remove PT64_SECOND_AVAIL_BITS_SHIFT as it is at best misleading, and at
worst wrong.  For PAE paging, which arguably is a variant of PT64, the
bits are reserved.  For MMIO SPTEs the bits are not available as they're
used for the MMIO generation.  For access tracked SPTEs, they are also
not available as bits 56:54 are used to store the original RX bits.

No functional change intended.
