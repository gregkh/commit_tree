Commit 4a1e10d5b5d8 ("KVM: x86: handle hardware breakpoints during emulation())
adds hardware breakpoints check before emulation the instruction and parts of
emulation context initialization, actually we don't have the EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE flag
here and the emulation context will not be reused. Commit c8848cee74ff ("KVM: x86:
set ctxt->have_exception in x86_decode_insn()) triggers the warning because it
catches the stale emulation context has #UD, however, it is not during instruction
decoding which should result in EMULATION_FAILED. This patch fixes it by moving
the second part emulation context initialization into init_emulate_ctxt() and
before hardware breakpoints check. The ctxt->ud will be dropped by a follow-up
patch.
