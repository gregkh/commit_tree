can: mcp251x: fix resume from sleep before interface was brought up

Since 8ce8c0abcba3 the driver queues work via priv->restart_work when
resuming after suspend, even when the interface was not previously
enabled. This causes a null dereference error as the workqueue is only
allocated and initialized in mcp251x_open().

To fix this we move the workqueue init to mcp251x_can_probe() as there
is no reason to do it later and repeat it whenever mcp251x_open() is
called.

Fixes: 8ce8c0abcba3 ("can: mcp251x: only reset hardware as required")
