usb: typec: tcpm: Don't block probing of consumers of "connector" nodes

fw_devlink expects DT device nodes with "compatible" property to have
struct devices created for them. Since the connector node might not be
populated as a device, mark it as such so that fw_devlink knows not to
wait on this fwnode being populated as a struct device.

Without this patch, USB functionality can be broken on some boards.
