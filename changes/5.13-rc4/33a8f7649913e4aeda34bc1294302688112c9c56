net: hns3: expand the tc config command

The device HNAE3_DEVICE_VERSION_V3 supports up to 1280 queues
and qsets for one function, so the bitwidth of tc_offset, meaning
the tqps index, needs to expand from 10 bits to 11 bits.

The device HNAE3_DEVICE_VERSION_V3 supports up to 512 queues on
one TC. The tc_size, meaning the exponent with base 2 of queues
supported on TC, which needs to expand from 3 bits to 4 bits.
