ASoC: samsung: smdk_wm8994: add missing return

cppcheck warning:

sound/soc/samsung/smdk_wm8994.c:179:6: style: Variable 'ret' is
reassigned a value before the old one has been
used. [redundantAssignment]
 ret = devm_snd_soc_register_card(&pdev->dev, card);
     ^
sound/soc/samsung/smdk_wm8994.c:166:8: note: ret is assigned
   ret = -EINVAL;
       ^
sound/soc/samsung/smdk_wm8994.c:179:6: note: ret is overwritten
 ret = devm_snd_soc_register_card(&pdev->dev, card);
     ^

The initial authors bothered to set ret to -EINVAL and throw a
dev_err() message, so it looks like there is a missing return to avoid
continuing if the property is missing.
