drm/amd/display: Add vupdate_no_lock interrupts for DCN2.1

When run igt@kms_vrr in a device that uses DCN2.1 architecture, we
noticed multiple failures. Furthermore, when we tested a VRR demo, we
noticed a system hang where the mouse pointer still works, but the
entire system freezes; in this case, we don't see any dmesg warning or
failure messages kernel. This happens due to a lack of vupdate_no_lock
interrupt, making the userspace wait eternally to get the event back.
For fixing this issue, we need to add the vupdate_no_lock interrupt in
the interrupt list.
