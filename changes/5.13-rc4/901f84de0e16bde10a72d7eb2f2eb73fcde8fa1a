iio: core: fix ioctl handlers removal

Currently ioctl handlers are removed twice. For the first time during
iio_device_unregister() then later on inside
iio_device_unregister_eventset() and iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask().
Double free leads to kernel panic.

Fix this by not touching ioctl handlers list directly but rather
letting code responsible for registration call the matching cleanup
routine itself.
