openrisc: Fix a memory leak

'setup_find_cpu_node()' take a reference on the node it returns.
This reference must be decremented when not needed anymore, or there will
be a leak.

Add the missing 'of_node_put(cpu)'.

Note that 'setup_cpuinfo()' that also calls this function already has a
correct 'of_node_put(cpu)' at its end.
