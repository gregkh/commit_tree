Revert "leds: lp5523: fix a missing check of return value of lp55xx_read"

This reverts commit 248b57015f35c94d4eae2fdd8c6febf5cd703900.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original commit does not properly unwind if there is an error
condition so it needs to be reverted at this point in time.
