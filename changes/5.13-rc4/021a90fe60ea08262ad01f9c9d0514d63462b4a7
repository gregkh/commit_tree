PCI: mobiveil: Improve PCIE_LAYERSCAPE_GEN4 dependencies

  - Drop the dependency on PCI, as this is implied by the dependency on
    PCI_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN,
  - Drop the dependencies on OF and ARM64, as the driver compiles fine
    without OF and/or on other architectures,
  - The Freescale Layerscape PCIe Gen4 controller is present only on
    Freescale Layerscape SoCs.  Hence depend on ARCH_LAYERSCAPE, to
    prevent asking the user about this driver when configuring a kernel
    without Freescale Layerscape support, unless compile-testing.
