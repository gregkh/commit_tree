drm/msm/mdp5: Configure PP_SYNC_HEIGHT to double the vtotal

Leaving this at a close-to-maximum register value 0xFFF0 means it takes
very long for the MDSS to generate a software vsync interrupt when the
hardware TE interrupt doesn't arrive.  Configuring this to double the
vtotal (like some downstream kernels) leads to a frame to take at most
twice before the vsync signal, until hardware TE comes up.

In this case the hardware interrupt responsible for providing this
signal - "disp-te" gpio - is not hooked up to the mdp5 vsync/pp logic at
all.  This solves severe panel update issues observed on at least the
Xperia Loire and Tone series, until said gpio is properly hooked up to
an irq.
