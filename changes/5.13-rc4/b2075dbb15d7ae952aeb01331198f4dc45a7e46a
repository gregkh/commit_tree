kexec: dump kmessage before machine_kexec

kmsg_dump(KMSG_DUMP_SHUTDOWN) is called before machine_restart(),
machine_halt(), and machine_power_off().  The only one that is missing
is machine_kexec().

The dmesg output that it contains can be used to study the shutdown
performance of both kernel and systemd during kexec reboot.

Here is example of dmesg data collected after kexec:

  root@dplat-cp22:~# cat /sys/fs/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0 | tail
  ...
  [   70.914592] psci: CPU3 killed (polled 0 ms)
  [   70.915705] CPU4: shutdown
  [   70.916643] psci: CPU4 killed (polled 4 ms)
  [   70.917715] CPU5: shutdown
  [   70.918725] psci: CPU5 killed (polled 0 ms)
  [   70.919704] CPU6: shutdown
  [   70.920726] psci: CPU6 killed (polled 4 ms)
  [   70.921642] CPU7: shutdown
  [   70.922650] psci: CPU7 killed (polled 0 ms)
