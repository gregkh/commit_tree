ASoC: es8316: Simplify adc_pga_gain_tlv table

Most steps in this table are steps of 3dB (300 centi-dB), so we can
simplify the table.

This not only reduces the amount of space it takes inside the kernel,
this also makes alsa-lib's mixer code actually accept the table, where
as before this change alsa-lib saw the "ADC PGA Gain" control as a
control without a dB scale.
