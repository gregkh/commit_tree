bpf: Fix BPF_LSM kconfig symbol dependency

Similarly as 6bdacdb48e94 ("bpf: Fix BPF_JIT kconfig symbol dependency") we
need to detangle the hard BPF_LSM dependency on NET. This was previously
implicit by its dependency on BPF_JIT which itself was dependent on NET (but
without any actual/real hard dependency code-wise). Given the latter was
lifted, so should be the former as BPF_LSMs could well exist on net-less
systems. This therefore also fixes a randconfig build error recently reported
by Randy:

  ld: kernel/bpf/bpf_lsm.o: in function `bpf_lsm_func_proto':
  bpf_lsm.c:(.text+0x1a0): undefined reference to `bpf_sk_storage_get_proto'
  ld: bpf_lsm.c:(.text+0x1b8): undefined reference to `bpf_sk_storage_delete_proto'
  [...]
