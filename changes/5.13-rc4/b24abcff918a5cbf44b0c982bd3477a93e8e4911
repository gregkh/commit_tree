bpf, kconfig: Add consolidated menu entry for bpf with core options

Right now, all core BPF related options are scattered in different Kconfig
locations mainly due to historic reasons. Moving forward, lets add a proper
subsystem entry under ...

  General setup  --->
    BPF subsystem  --->

... in order to have all knobs in a single location and thus ease BPF related
configuration. Networking related bits such as sockmap are out of scope for
the general setup and therefore better suited to remain in net/Kconfig.
