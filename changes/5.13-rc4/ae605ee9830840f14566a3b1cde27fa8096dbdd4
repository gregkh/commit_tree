xprtrdma: Revert 586a0787ce35

Commit 9ed5af268e88 ("SUNRPC: Clean up the handling of page padding
in rpc_prepare_reply_pages()") [Dec 2020] affects RPC Replies that
have a data payload (i.e., Write chunks).

rpcrdma_prepare_readch(), as its name suggests, sets up Read chunks
which are data payloads within RPC Calls. Those payloads are
constructed by xdr_write_pages(), which continues to stuff the call
buffer's tail kvec with the payload's XDR roundup. Thus removing
the tail buffer logic in rpcrdma_prepare_readch() was the wrong
thing to do.
