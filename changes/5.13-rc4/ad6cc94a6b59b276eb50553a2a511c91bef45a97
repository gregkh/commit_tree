drm/amdkfd: Fix saving the ACC vgprs for Aldebaran

get_num_acc_vgprs does not set status.scc if the number of acc vgprs
is 0, so use an and instruction to set the condition code.

The Aldebaran handler binary was not based on the latest version of
the sources, so this update to the binary is the minimal change only
adding two instructions to set the condition code.

A newer version of the handler should be generated and tested in
another commit.
