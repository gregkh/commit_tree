KVM: PPC: exit halt polling on need_resched()

This is inspired by commit 262de4102c7bb8 (kvm: exit halt polling on
need_resched() as well). Due to PPC implements an arch specific halt
polling logic, we have to the need_resched() check there as well. This
patch adds a helper function that can be shared between book3s and generic
halt-polling loops.
