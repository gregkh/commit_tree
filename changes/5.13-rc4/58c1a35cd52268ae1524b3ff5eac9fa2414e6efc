btrfs: convert kmap to kmap_local_page, simple cases

Use a simple coccinelle script to help convert the most common
kmap()/kunmap() patterns to kmap_local_page()/kunmap_local().

Note that some kmaps which were caught by this script needed to be
handled by hand because of the strict unmapping order of kunmap_local()
so they are not included in this patch.  But this script got us started.

There's another temp variable added for the final length write to the
first page so it does not interfere with cpage_out that is used for
mapping other pages.

The development of this patch was aided by the follow script:

// <smpl>
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only
// Find kmap and replace with kmap_local_page then mark kunmap
//
// Confidence: Low

(
-kmap(e)
+kmap_local_page(e)
)
...
(
-kunmap(...)
+kunmap_local()
)

// </smpl>
