ALSA: intel8x0: Don't update period unless prepared

The interrupt handler of intel8x0 calls snd_intel8x0_update() whenever
the hardware sets the corresponding status bit for each stream.  This
works fine for most cases as long as the hardware behaves properly.
But when the hardware gives a wrong bit set, this leads to a zero-
division Oops, and reportedly, this seems what happened on a VM.

For fixing the crash, this patch adds a internal flag indicating that
the stream is ready to be updated, and check it (as well as the flag
being in suspended) to ignore such spurious update.
