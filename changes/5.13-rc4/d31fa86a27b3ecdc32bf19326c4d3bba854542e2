mm/filemap: use filemap_read_page in filemap_fault

After splitting generic_file_buffered_read() into smaller parts, it turns
out we can reuse one of the parts in filemap_fault().  This fixes an
oversight -- waiting for the I/O to complete is now interruptible by a
fatal signal.  And it saves us a few bytes of text in an unlikely path.
