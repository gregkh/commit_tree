powerpc/32: Statically initialise first emergency context

The check of the emergency context initialisation in
vmap_stack_overflow is buggy for the SMP case, as it
compares r1 with 0 while in the SMP case r1 is offseted
by the CPU id.

Instead of fixing it, just perform static initialisation
of the first emergency context.
