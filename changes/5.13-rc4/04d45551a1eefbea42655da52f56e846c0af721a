KVM: x86/mmu: Alloc page for PDPTEs when shadowing 32-bit NPT with 64-bit

Allocate the so called pae_root page on-demand, along with the lm_root
page, when shadowing 32-bit NPT with 64-bit NPT, i.e. when running a
32-bit L1.  KVM currently only allocates the page when NPT is disabled,
or when L0 is 32-bit (using PAE paging).

Note, there is an existing memory leak involving the MMU roots, as KVM
fails to free the PAE roots on failure.  This will be addressed in a
future commit.

Fixes: ee6268ba3a68 ("KVM: x86: Skip pae_root shadow allocation if tdp enabled")
Fixes: b6b80c78af83 ("KVM: x86/mmu: Allocate PAE root array when using SVM's 32-bit NPT")
