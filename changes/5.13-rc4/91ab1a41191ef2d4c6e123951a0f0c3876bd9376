pagewalk: prefix struct kernel-doc descriptions

The script './scripts/kernel-doc -none ./include/linux/pagewalk.h' reports:

  include/linux/pagewalk.h:37: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct mm_walk_ops '
  include/linux/pagewalk.h:85: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct mm_walk '

A kernel-doc description for a structure requires to prefix the struct
name with the keyword 'struct'.  So, do that such that no further
kernel-doc warnings are reported for this file.
