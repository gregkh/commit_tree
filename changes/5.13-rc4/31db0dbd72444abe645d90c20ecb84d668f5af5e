net: hso: check for allocation failure in hso_create_bulk_serial_device()

In current kernels, small allocations never actually fail so this
patch shouldn't affect runtime.

Originally this error handling code written with the idea that if
the "serial->tiocmget" allocation failed, then we would continue
operating instead of bailing out early.  But in later years we added
an unchecked dereference on the next line.

	serial->tiocmget->serial_state_notification = kzalloc();
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since these allocations are never going fail in real life, this is
mostly a philosophical debate, but I think bailing out early is the
correct behavior that the user would want.  And generally it's safer to
bail as soon an error happens.
