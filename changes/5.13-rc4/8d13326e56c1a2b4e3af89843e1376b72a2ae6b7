io_uring: optimise fill_event() by inlining

There are three cases where we much care about performance of
io_cqring_fill_event() -- flushing inline completions, iopoll and
io_req_complete_post(). Inline a hot part of fill_event() into them.

All others are not as important and we don't want to bloat binary for
them, so add a noinline version of the function for all other use
use cases.
