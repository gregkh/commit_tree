net: dsa: fix bridge support for drivers without port_bridge_flags callback

Starting with patch:
a8b659e7ff75 ("net: dsa: act as passthrough for bridge port flags")

drivers without "port_bridge_flags" callback will fail to join the bridge.
Looking at the code, -EOPNOTSUPP seems to be the proper return value,
which makes at least microchip and atheros switches work again.

Fixes: 5961d6a12c13 ("net: dsa: inherit the actual bridge port flags at join time")
