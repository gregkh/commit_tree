netfilter: iptables: unregister the tables by name

xtables stores the xt_table structs in the struct net.  This isn't
needed anymore, the structures could be passed via the netfilter hook
'private' pointer to the hook functions, which would allow us to remove
those pointers from struct net.

As a first step, reduce the number of accesses to the
net->ipv4.ip6table_{raw,filter,...} pointers.
This allows the tables to get unregistered by name instead of having to
pass the raw address.

The xt_table structure cane looked up by name+address family instead.

This patch is useless as-is (the backends still have the raw pointer
address), but it lowers the bar to remove those.

It also allows to put the 'was table registered in the first place' check
into ip_tables.c rather than have it in each table sub module.
