Revert "media: gspca: Check the return value of write_bridge for timeout"

This reverts commit a21a0eb56b4e8fe4a330243af8030f890cde2283.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

Different error values should never be "OR" together and expect anything
sane to come out of the result.
