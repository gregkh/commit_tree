bcache: Use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Cast multiple variables to (int64_t) in order to give the compiler
complete information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that
these variables are being used in contexts that expect expressions of
type int64_t  (64 bit, signed). And currently, such expressions are
being evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.
