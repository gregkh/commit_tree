bpf: Add deny list of btf ids check for tracing programs

The recursion check in __bpf_prog_enter and __bpf_prog_exit
leaves some (not inlined) functions unprotected:

In __bpf_prog_enter:
  - migrate_disable is called before prog->active is checked

In __bpf_prog_exit:
  - migrate_enable,rcu_read_unlock_strict are called after
    prog->active is decreased

When attaching trampoline to them we get panic like:

  traps: PANIC: double fault, error_code: 0x0
  double fault: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
  RIP: 0010:__bpf_prog_enter+0x4/0x50
  ...
  Call Trace:
   <IRQ>
   bpf_trampoline_6442466513_0+0x18/0x1000
   migrate_disable+0x5/0x50
   __bpf_prog_enter+0x9/0x50
   bpf_trampoline_6442466513_0+0x18/0x1000
   migrate_disable+0x5/0x50
   __bpf_prog_enter+0x9/0x50
   bpf_trampoline_6442466513_0+0x18/0x1000
   migrate_disable+0x5/0x50
   __bpf_prog_enter+0x9/0x50
   bpf_trampoline_6442466513_0+0x18/0x1000
   migrate_disable+0x5/0x50
   ...

Fixing this by adding deny list of btf ids for tracing
programs and checking btf id during program verification.
Adding above functions to this list.
