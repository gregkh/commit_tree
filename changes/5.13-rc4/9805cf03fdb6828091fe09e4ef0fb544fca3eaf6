KVM: LAPIC: Narrow the timer latency between wait_lapic_expire and world switch

Let's treat lapic_timer_advance_ns automatic tuning logic as hypervisor
overhead, move it before wait_lapic_expire instead of between wait_lapic_expire
and the world switch, the wait duration should be calculated by the
up-to-date guest_tsc after the overhead of automatic tuning logic. This
patch reduces ~30+ cycles for kvm-unit-tests/tscdeadline-latency when testing
busy waits.
