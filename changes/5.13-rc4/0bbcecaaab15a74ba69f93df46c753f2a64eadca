ASoC: tegra30: i2s: Restore hardware state on runtime PM resume

Tegra30 I2S driver syncs regmap cache only on resume from system suspend,
but hardware is reset across the runtime suspend because RPM of the parent
AHUB driver resets the I2S hardware, hence h/w state is lost after each
RPM resume. The problem isn't visible because hardware happens to be fully
reprogrammed after each RPM resume. Move hardware syncing to RPM resume in
order to restore h/w state properly.
