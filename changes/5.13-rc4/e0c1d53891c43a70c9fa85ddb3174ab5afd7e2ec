dmaengine: dw-edma: Add support for the HDMA feature

Add support for the HDMA feature.

This new feature enables the current eDMA IP to use a deeper prefetch
of the linked list, which reduces the algorithm execution latency
observed when loading the elements of the list, causing more stable
and higher data transfer.
