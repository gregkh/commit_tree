MIPS: add support for buggy MT7621S core detection

Most MT7621 SoCs have 2 cores, which is detected and supported properly
by CPS.

Unfortunately, MT7621 SoC has a less common S variant with only one core.
On MT7621S, GCR_CONFIG still reports 2 cores, which leads to hangs when
starting SMP. CPULAUNCH registers can be used in that case to detect the
absence of the second core and override the GCR_CONFIG PCORES field.

Rework a long-standing OpenWrt patch to override the value of
mips_cps_numcores on single-core MT7621 systems.

Tested on a dual-core MT7621 device (Ubiquiti ER-X) and a single-core
MT7621 device (Netgear R6220).
