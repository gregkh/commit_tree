KVM: selftests: Print a message if /dev/kvm is missing

If a KVM selftest is run on a machine without /dev/kvm, it will exit
silently. Make it easy to tell what's happening by printing an error
message.

Opportunistically consolidate all codepaths that open /dev/kvm into a
single function so they all print the same message.

This slightly changes the semantics of vm_is_unrestricted_guest() by
changing a TEST_ASSERT() to exit(KSFT_SKIP). However
vm_is_unrestricted_guest() is only called in one place
(x86_64/mmio_warning_test.c) and that is to determine if the test should
be skipped or not.
