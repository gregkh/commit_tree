media: venus: hfi_parser: Don't initialize parser on v1

The Venus v1 behaves differently comparing with the other Venus
version in respect to capability parsing and when they are send
to the driver. So we don't need to initialize hfi parser for
multiple invocations like what we do for > v1 Venus versions.
