x86/sev-es: Rename sev-es.{ch} to sev.{ch}

SEV-SNP builds upon the SEV-ES functionality while adding new hardware
protection. Version 2 of the GHCB specification adds new NAE events that
are SEV-SNP specific. Rename the sev-es.{ch} to sev.{ch} so that all
SEV* functionality can be consolidated in one place.
