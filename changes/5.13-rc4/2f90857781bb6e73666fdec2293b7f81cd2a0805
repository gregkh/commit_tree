media: qcom: camss: Fix overflows in clock rate calculations

Because of u32 type being used to store pixel clock rate, expression used
to calculate pipeline clocks (pixel_clock * bpp) produces wrong value due
to integer overflow. This patch changes data type used to store, pass and
retrieve pixel_clock from u32 to u64 to make this mistake less likely to
be repeated in the future.
