IB/hfi1: Use kzalloc() for mmu_rb_handler allocation

The code currently assumes that the mmu_notifier struct
embedded in mmu_rb_handler only contains two fields.

There are now extra fields:

struct mmu_notifier {
        struct hlist_node hlist;
        const struct mmu_notifier_ops *ops;
        struct mm_struct *mm;
        struct rcu_head rcu;
        unsigned int users;
};

Given that there in no init for the mmu_notifier, a kzalloc() should
be used to insure that any newly added fields are given a predictable
initial value of zero.
