pinctrl: samsung: use 'int' for register masks in Exynos

The Special Function Registers on all Exynos SoC, including ARM64, are
32-bit wide, so entire driver uses matching functions like readl() or
writel().  On 64-bit ARM using unsigned long for register masks:
1. makes little sense as immediately after bitwise operation it will be
   cast to 32-bit value when calling writel(),
2. is actually error-prone because it might promote other operands to
   64-bit.
