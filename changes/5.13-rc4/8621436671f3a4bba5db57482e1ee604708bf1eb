smc: disallow TCP_ULP in smc_setsockopt()

syzbot is able to setup kTLS on an SMC socket which coincidentally
uses sk_user_data too. Later, kTLS treats it as psock so triggers a
refcnt warning. The root cause is that smc_setsockopt() simply calls
TCP setsockopt() which includes TCP_ULP. I do not think it makes
sense to setup kTLS on top of SMC sockets, so we should just disallow
this setup.

It is hard to find a commit to blame, but we can apply this patch
since the beginning of TCP_ULP.
