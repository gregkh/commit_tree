powerpc/syscall: switch user_exit_irqoff and trace_hardirqs_off order

user_exit_irqoff() -> __context_tracking_exit -> vtime_user_exit
warns in __seqprop_assert due to lockdep thinking preemption is enabled
because trace_hardirqs_off() has not yet been called.

Switch the order of these two calls, which matches their ordering in
interrupt_enter_prepare.
