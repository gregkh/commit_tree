usb: Restore the usb_header label

Commit caa93d9bd2d7 ("usb: Fix up movement of USB core kerneldoc location")
removed the reference to the _usb_header label by mistake, which causes the
following htmldocs build warning:

Documentation/driver-api/usb/writing_usb_driver.rst:129: WARNING: undefined label: usb_header

Restore the label.
