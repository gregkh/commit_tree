sata_mv: add IRQ checks

The function mv_platform_probe() neglects to check the results of the
calls to platform_get_irq() and irq_of_parse_and_map() and blithely
passes them to ata_host_activate() -- while the latter only checks
for IRQ0 (treating it as a polling mode indicattion) and passes the
negative values to devm_request_irq() causing it to fail as it takes
unsigned values for the IRQ #...

Add to mv_platform_probe() the proper IRQ checks to pass the positive IRQ
#s to ata_host_activate(), propagate upstream the negative error codes,
and override the IRQ0 with -EINVAL (as we don't want the polling mode).
