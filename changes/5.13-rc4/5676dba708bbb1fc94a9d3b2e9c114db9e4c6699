perf annotate: Fix sample events lost in stdio mode

In hist__find_annotations(), since different 'struct hist_entry' entries
may point to same symbol, we free notes->src to signal already processed
this symbol in stdio mode; when annotate, entry will skipped if
notes->src is NULL to avoid repeated output.

However, there is a problem, for example, run the following command:

 # perf record -e branch-misses -e branch-instructions -a sleep 1

perf.data file contains different types of sample event.

If the same IP sample event exists in branch-misses and branch-instructions,
this event uses the same symbol. When annotate branch-misses events, notes->src
corresponding to this event is set to null, as a result, when annotate
branch-instructions events, this event is skipped and no annotate is output.

Solution of this patch is to remove zfree in hists__find_annotations and
change sort order to "dso,symbol" to avoid duplicate output when different
processes correspond to the same symbol.
