rds: ib: Remove two ib_modify_qp() calls

For some HCAs, ib_modify_qp() is an expensive operation running
virtualized.

For both the active and passive side, the QP returned by the CM has the
state set to RTS, so no need for this excess RTS -> RTS transition. With
IB Core's ability to set the RNR Retry timer, we use this interface to
shave off another ib_modify_qp().
