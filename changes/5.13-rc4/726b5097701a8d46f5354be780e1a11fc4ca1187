printk: refactor kmsg_dump_get_buffer()

kmsg_dump_get_buffer() requires nearly the same logic as
syslog_print_all(), but uses different variable names and
does not make use of the ringbuffer loop macros. Modify
kmsg_dump_get_buffer() so that the implementation is as similar
to syslog_print_all() as possible.

A follow-up commit will move this common logic into a
separate helper function.
