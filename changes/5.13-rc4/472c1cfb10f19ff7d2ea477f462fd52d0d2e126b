scsi: message: fusion: Avoid -Wempty-body warnings

There are a couple of warnings in this driver when building with W=1:

drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c: In function 'PrimeIocFifos':
drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c:4608:65: error: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement [-Werror=empty-body]
 4608 |                     "restoring 64 bit addressing\n", ioc->name));
      |                                                                 ^
drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c:4633:65: error: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement [-Werror=empty-body]
 4633 |                     "restoring 64 bit addressing\n", ioc->name));

The macros are slightly suboptimal since are not proper statements.
Change both versions to the usual "do { ... } while (0)" style to
make them more robust and avoid the warning.
