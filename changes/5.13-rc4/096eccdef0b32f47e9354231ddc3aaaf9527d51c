selftests/bpf: Rewrite test_tc_redirect.sh as prog_tests/tc_redirect.c

As discussed in [0], this ports test_tc_redirect.sh to the test_progs
framework and removes the old test.

This makes it more in line with rest of the tests and makes it possible
to run this test case with vmtest.sh and under the bpf CI.

The upcoming skb_change_head() helper fix in [0] is depending on it and
extending the test case to redirect a packet from L3 device to veth.
