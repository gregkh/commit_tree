selftests/bpf: Add test for l3 use of bpf_redirect_peer

Add a test case for using bpf_skb_change_head() in combination with
bpf_redirect_peer() to redirect a packet from a L3 device to veth and back.

The test uses a BPF program that adds L2 headers to the packet coming
from a L3 device and then calls bpf_redirect_peer() to redirect the packet
to a veth device. The test fails as skb->mac_len is not set properly and
thus the ethernet headers are not properly skb_pull'd in cls_bpf_classify(),
causing tcp_v4_rcv() to point the TCP header into middle of the IP header.
