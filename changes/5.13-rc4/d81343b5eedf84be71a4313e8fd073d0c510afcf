selftests/resctrl: Fix incorrect parsing of iMC counters

iMC (Integrated Memory Controller) counters are usually at
"/sys/bus/event_source/devices/" and are named as "uncore_imc_<n>".
num_of_imcs() function tries to count number of such iMC counters so that
it could appropriately initialize required number of perf_attr structures
that could be used to read these iMC counters.

num_of_imcs() function assumes that all the directories under this path
that start with "uncore_imc" are iMC counters. But, on some systems there
could be directories named as "uncore_imc_free_running" which aren't iMC
counters. Trying to read from such directories will result in "not found
file" errors and MBM/MBA tests will fail.

Hence, fix the logic in num_of_imcs() such that it looks at the first
character after "uncore_imc_" to check if it's a numerical digit or not. If
it's a digit then the directory represents an iMC counter, else, skip the
directory.
