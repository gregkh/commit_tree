ASoC: cs42l42: Regmap must use_single_read/write

cs42l42 does not support standard burst transfers so the use_single_read
and use_single_write flags must be set in the regmap config.

Because of this bug, the patch:

commit 0a0eb567e1d4 ("ASoC: cs42l42: Minor error paths fixups")

broke cs42l42 probe() because without the use_single_* flags it causes
regmap to issue a burst read.

However, the missing use_single_* could cause problems anyway because the
regmap cache can attempt burst transfers if these flags are not set.
