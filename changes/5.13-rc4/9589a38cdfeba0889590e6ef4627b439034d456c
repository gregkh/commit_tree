KVM: arm64: Disable PMU support in protected mode

The host currently writes directly in EL2 per-CPU data sections from
the PMU code when running in nVHE. In preparation for unmapping the EL2
sections from the host stage 2, disable PMU support in protected mode as
we currently do not have a use-case for it.
