io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers

Colin reported before possible overflow and sign extension problems in
io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing
useful, see d81269fecb8ce ("io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension").

Do that with help of check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct
io_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn't make much sense to keep it
signed.
