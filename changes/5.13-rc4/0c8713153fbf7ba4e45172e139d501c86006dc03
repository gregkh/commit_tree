drivers: base: Reduce device link removal code duplication

Reduce device link removal code duplication between the cases when
SRCU is enabled and when it is disabled by moving the only differing
piece of it (which is the removal of the link from the consumer and
supplier lists) into a separate wrapper function (defined differently
for each of the cases in question).

No intentional functional impact.
