perf buildid-cache: Add test for PE executable

This builds on the previous changes to tests/shell/buildid.sh, adding
tests for a PE file. It adds it to the build-id cache manually and, if
Wine is available, runs it under "perf record" and verifies that it was
added automatically.

If wine is not installed, only warnings are printed; the test can still
exit 0.
