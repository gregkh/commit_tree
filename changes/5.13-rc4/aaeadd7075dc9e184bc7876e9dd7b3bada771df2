nvmet: fix false keep-alive timeout when a controller is torn down

Controller teardown flow may take some time in case it has many I/O
queues, and the host may not send us keep-alive during this period.
Hence reset the traffic based keep-alive timer so we don't trigger
a controller teardown as a result of a keep-alive expiration.
