printk: add syslog_lock

The global variables @syslog_seq, @syslog_partial, @syslog_time
and write access to @clear_seq are protected by @logbuf_lock.
Once @logbuf_lock is removed, these variables will need their
own synchronization method. Introduce @syslog_lock for this
purpose.

@syslog_lock is a raw_spin_lock for now. This simplifies the
transition to removing @logbuf_lock. Once @logbuf_lock and the
safe buffers are removed, @syslog_lock can change to spin_lock.
