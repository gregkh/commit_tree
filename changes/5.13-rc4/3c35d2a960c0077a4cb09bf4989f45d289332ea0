serial: 8250_dw: Add device HID for new AMD UART controller

Add device HID AMDI0022 to the AMD UART controller driver match table
and create a platform device for it. This controller can be found on
Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 devices and seems similar enough that we can
just copy the existing AMDI0020 entries.
