net/mlx5e: Reject mirroring on source port change encap rules

Rules with MLX5_ESW_DEST_CHAIN_WITH_SRC_PORT_CHANGE dest flag are
translated to destination FT in eswitch. Currently it is not possible to
mirror such rules because firmware doesn't support mixing FT and Vport
destinations in single rule when one of them adds encapsulation. Since the
only use case for MLX5_ESW_DEST_CHAIN_WITH_SRC_PORT_CHANGE destination is
support for tunnel endpoints on VF and trying to offload such rule with
mirror action causes either crash in fs_core or firmware error with
syndrome 0xff6a1d, reject all such rules in mlx5 TC layer.
