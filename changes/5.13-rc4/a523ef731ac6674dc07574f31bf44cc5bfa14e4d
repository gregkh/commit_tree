ASoC: Intel: kbl_da7219_max98927: Fix kabylake_ssp_fixup function

kabylake_ssp_fixup function uses snd_soc_dpcm to identify the
codecs DAIs. The HW parameters are changed based on the codec DAI of the
stream. The earlier approach to get snd_soc_dpcm was using container_of()
macro on snd_pcm_hw_params.

The structures have been modified over time and snd_soc_dpcm does not have
snd_pcm_hw_params as a reference but as a copy. This causes the current
driver to crash when used.

This patch changes the way snd_soc_dpcm is extracted. snd_soc_pcm_runtime
holds 2 dpcm instances (one for playback and one for capture). 2 codecs
on the SSP are dmic (capture) and speakers (playback). Based on the
stream direction, snd_soc_dpcm is extracted from snd_soc_pcm_runtime.

Tested for all use cases of the driver.
Based on similar fix in kbl_rt5663_rt5514_max98927.c
