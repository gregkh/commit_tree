perf/x86: Avoid touching LBR_TOS MSR for Arch LBR

The Architecture LBR does not have MSR_LBR_TOS (0x000001c9).
In a guest that should support Architecture LBR, check_msr()
will be a non-related check for the architecture MSR 0x0
(IA32_P5_MC_ADDR) that is also not supported by KVM.

The failure will cause x86_pmu.lbr_nr = 0, thereby preventing
the initialization of the guest Arch LBR. Fix it by avoiding
this extraneous check in intel_pmu_init() for Arch LBR.
