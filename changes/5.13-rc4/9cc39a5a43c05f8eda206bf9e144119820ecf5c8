KVM: x86: Export the number of uret MSRs to vendor modules

Split out and export the number of configured user return MSRs so that
VMX can iterate over the set of MSRs without having to do its own tracking.
Keep the list itself internal to x86 so that vendor code still has to go
through the "official" APIs to add/modify entries.
