spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: Resolved slab-out-of-bounds bug

During a transfer the driver filled the fifo with 4bytes,
even if the data that needs to be transfer is less that 4bytes.
This resulted in slab-out-of-bounds bug in KernelAddressSanitizer.

This patch resolves slab-out-of-bounds bug by filling the fifo
with the number of bytes that needs to transferred.
