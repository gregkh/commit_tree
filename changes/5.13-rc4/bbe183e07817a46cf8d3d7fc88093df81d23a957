ALSA: hda/realtek: fix mute/micmute LEDs and speaker for HP Zbook G8

The HP ZBook Studio 15.6 Inch G8 is using ALC285 codec which is
using 0x04 to control mute LED and 0x01 to control micmute LED.
In the other hand, there is no output from right channel of speaker.
Therefore, add a quirk to make it works.
