ath9k: fix ath_tx_process_buffer() potential null ptr dereference

ath_tx_process_buffer() references ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr()
return pointer (sta) outside null check. Fix it by moving the code
block under the null check.

This problem was found while reviewing code to debug RCU warn from
ath10k_wmi_tlv_parse_peer_stats_info() and a subsequent manual audit
of other callers of ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() that don't hold
RCU read lock.
