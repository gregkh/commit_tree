net: ipa: update sequence type for modem TX endpoint

On IPA v3.5.1, the sequencer type for the modem TX endpoint does not
define the replication portion in the same way the downstream code
does.  This difference doesn't affect the behavior of the upstream
code, but I'd prefer the two code bases use the same configuration
value here.
