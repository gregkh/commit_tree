KVM: X86: Fix failure to boost kernel lock holder candidate in SEV-ES guests

Commit f1c6366e3043 ("KVM: SVM: Add required changes to support intercepts under
SEV-ES") prevents hypervisor accesses guest register state when the guest is
running under SEV-ES. The initial value of vcpu->arch.guest_state_protected
is false, it will not be updated in preemption notifiers after this commit which
means that the kernel spinlock lock holder will always be skipped to boost. Let's
fix it by always treating preempted is in the guest kernel mode, false positive
is better than skip completely.
