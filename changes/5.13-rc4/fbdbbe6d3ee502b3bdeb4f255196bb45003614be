usb: gadget: pch_udc: Check if driver is present before calling ->setup()

Since we have a separate routine for VBUS sense, the interrupt may occur
before gadget driver is present. Hence, ->setup() call may oops the kernel:

[   55.245843] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000010
...
[   55.245843] EIP: pch_udc_isr.cold+0x162/0x33f
...
[   55.245843]  <IRQ>
[   55.245843]  ? pch_udc_svc_data_out+0x160/0x160

Check if driver is present before calling ->setup().
