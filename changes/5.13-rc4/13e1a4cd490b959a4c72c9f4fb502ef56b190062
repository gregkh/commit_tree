ALSA: hda/realtek: Re-order ALC882 Clevo quirk table entries

Just re-order the alc882_fixup_tbl[] entries for Clevo devices for
avoiding the oversight of the duplicated or unapplied item in future.
No functional changes.

Also, user lower hex letters in the entry.

Also Cc-to-stable for the further patch applications.
