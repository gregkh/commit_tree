mptcp: use mptcp_addr_info in mptcp_options_received

This patch added a new struct mptcp_addr_info member addr in struct
mptcp_options_received, and dropped the original family, addr_id, addr,
addr6 and port fields in it. Then we can pass the parameter mp_opt.addr
directly to mptcp_pm_add_addr_received and mptcp_pm_add_addr_echoed.

Since the port number became big-endian now, use htons to convert the
incoming port number to it. Also use ntohs to convert it when passing
it to add_addr_generate_hmac or printing it out.
