net: dsa: fix error code getting shifted with 4 in dsa_slave_get_sset_count

DSA implements a bunch of 'standardized' ethtool statistics counters,
namely tx_packets, tx_bytes, rx_packets, rx_bytes. So whatever the
hardware driver returns in .get_sset_count(), we need to add 4 to that.

That is ok, except that .get_sset_count() can return a negative error
code, for example:

b53_get_sset_count
-> phy_ethtool_get_sset_count
   -> return -EIO

-EIO is -5, and with 4 added to it, it becomes -1, aka -EPERM. One can
imagine that certain error codes may even become positive, although
based on code inspection I did not see instances of that.

Check the error code first, if it is negative return it as-is.

Based on a similar patch for dsa_master_get_strings from Dan Carpenter:
