mips: Do not include hi and lo in clobber list for R6

From [1]
"GCC 10 (PR 91233) won't silently allow registers that are not
architecturally available to be present in the clobber list anymore,
resulting in build failure for mips*r6 targets in form of:
...
.../sysdep.h:146:2: error: the register ‘lo’ cannot be clobbered in ‘asm’ for the current target
  146 |  __asm__ volatile (      \
      |  ^~~~~~~

This is because base R6 ISA doesn't define hi and lo registers w/o DSP
extension. This patch provides the alternative clobber list for r6 targets
that won't include those registers."

Since kernel 5.4 and mips support for generic vDSO [2], the kernel fail to
build for mips r6 cpus with gcc 10 for the same reason as glibc.
