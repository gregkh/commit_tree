drm/vc4: hdmi: Support BCM2711 CEC interrupt setup

The HDMI controller found in the BCM2711 has an external interrupt
controller for the CEC and hotplug interrupt shared between the two
instances.

Let's add a variant flag to register a single interrupt handler and
deals with the interrupt handler setup, or two interrupt handlers
relying on an external irqchip.
