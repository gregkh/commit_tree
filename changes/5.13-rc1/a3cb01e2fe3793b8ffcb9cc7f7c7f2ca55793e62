USB: serial: usb_wwan: fix unprivileged TIOCCSERIAL

TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
closing_wait parameters.

A non-privileged user has only ever been able to set the since long
deprecated ASYNC_SPD flags and trying to change any other *supported*
feature should result in -EPERM being returned. Setting the current
values for any supported features should return success.

Fix the usb_wwan implementation which instead indicated that the
TIOCSSERIAL ioctl was not even implemented when a non-privileged user
set the current values.

Fixes: 02303f73373a ("usb-wwan: implement TIOCGSERIAL and TIOCSSERIAL to avoid blocking close(2)")
