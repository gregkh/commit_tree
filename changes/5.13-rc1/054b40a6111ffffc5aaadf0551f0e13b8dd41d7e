arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350-mtp: enable USB nodes

Enable both USB controllers and associated hsphy and qmp phy nodes
on sm8350 MTP. Designate the usb_1 instance as peripheral-mode only
until proper PMIC based Type-C dual-role handling is supported.

TODO: the second USB controller is exposed to a microAB port. Dual-
role can be supported for this by adding the "usb-role-switch"
property as well as defining a USB connector node with a
"gpio-usb-b-connector" compatible. However, this requires GPIO
support from PM8350 which is still missing.
