can: dev: can_free_echo_skb(): extend to return can frame length

In order to implement byte queue limits (bql) in CAN drivers, the
length of the CAN frame needs to be passed into the networking stack
even if the transmission failed for some reason.

To avoid to calculate this length twice, extend can_free_echo_skb() to
return that value. Convert all users of this function, too.

This patch is the natural extension of commit:

| 9420e1d495e2 ("can: dev: can_get_echo_skb(): extend to return can
|                frame length")
