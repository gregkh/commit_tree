ima: Fix function name error in comment.

The original function name was ima_path_check().  The policy parsing
still supports PATH_CHECK.   Commit 9bbb6cad0173 ("ima: rename
ima_path_check to ima_file_check") renamed the function to
ima_file_check(), but missed modifying the function name in the
comment.

Fixes: 9bbb6cad0173 ("ima: rename ima_path_check to ima_file_check").
