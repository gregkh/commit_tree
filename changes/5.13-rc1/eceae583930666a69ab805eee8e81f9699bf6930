mfd: Add base driver for Netronix embedded controller

The Netronix embedded controller is a microcontroller found in some
e-book readers designed by the original design manufacturer Netronix,
Inc. It contains RTC, battery monitoring, system power management, and
PWM functionality.

This driver implements register access and version detection.

Third-party hardware documentation is available at:

  https://github.com/neuschaefer/linux/wiki/Netronix-MSP430-embedded-controller

The EC supports interrupts, but the driver doesn't make use of them so
far.
