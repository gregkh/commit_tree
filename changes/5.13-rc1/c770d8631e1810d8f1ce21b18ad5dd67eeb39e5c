spi: Add HiSilicon SPI Controller Driver for Kunpeng SoCs

This driver supports SPI Controller for HiSilicon Kunpeng SoCs. This
driver supports SPI operations using FIFO mode of transfer.

DMA is not supported, and we just use IRQ mode for operation completion
notification.

Only ACPI firmware is supported.
