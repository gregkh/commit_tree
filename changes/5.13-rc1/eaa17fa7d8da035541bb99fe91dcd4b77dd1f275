iio:adc:ad_sigma_delta: Use IRQF_NO_AUTOEN rather than request and disable

These devices are not able to mask the signal used as a data ready
interrupt.  As such they previously requested the irq then immediately
disabled it.  Now we can avoid the potential of a spurious interrupt
by avoiding the irq being auto enabled in the first place.

I'm not sure how this code could have been called with the irq already
disabled, so I believe the conditional would always have been true and
have removed it.
