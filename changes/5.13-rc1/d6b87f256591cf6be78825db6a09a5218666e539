KVM: x86/mmu: Co-locate code for setting various SPTE masks

Squish all the code for (re)setting the various SPTE masks into one
location.  With the split code, it's not at all clear that the masks are
set once during module initialization.  This will allow a future patch to
clean up initialization of the masks without shuffling code all over
tarnation.

No functional change intended.
