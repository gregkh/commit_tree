bus: ti-sysc: Probe for l4_wkup and l4_cfg interconnect devices first

We want to probe l4_wkup and l4_cfg interconnect devices first to avoid
issues with missing resources. Otherwise we attempt to probe l4_per
devices first causing pointless deferred probe and also annoyingh
renumbering of the MMC devices for example.
