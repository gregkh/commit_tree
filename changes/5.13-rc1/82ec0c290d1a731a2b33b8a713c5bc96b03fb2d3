soc: qcom: wcnss_ctrl: Allow reading firmware-name from DT

The WLAN NV firmware blob differs between platforms, and possibly
devices, so add support in the wcnss_ctrl driver for reading the path of
this file from DT in order to allow these files to live in a generic
file system (or linux-firmware).

The new property is optional and the code falls back to the old filename
if the property isn't specified.
