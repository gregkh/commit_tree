bnxt_en: Treat health register value 0 as valid in bnxt_try_reover_fw().

The retry loop in bnxt_try_recover_fw() should not abort when the
health register value is 0.  It is a valid value that indicates the
firmware is booting up.

Fixes: 861aae786f2f ("bnxt_en: Enhance retry of the first message to the firmware.")
