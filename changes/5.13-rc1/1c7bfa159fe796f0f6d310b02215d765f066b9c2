btrfs: convert BUG_ON()'s in relocate_tree_block

We have a couple of BUG_ON()'s in relocate_tree_block() that can be
tripped if we have file system corruption.  Convert these to ASSERT()'s
so developers still get yelled at when they break the backref code, but
error out nicely for users so the whole box doesn't go down.
