memory: gpmc: fix out of bounds read and dereference on gpmc_cs[]

Currently the array gpmc_cs is indexed by cs before it cs is range checked
and the pointer read from this out-of-index read is dereferenced. Fix this
by performing the range check on cs before the read and the following
pointer dereference.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Negative array index read")
