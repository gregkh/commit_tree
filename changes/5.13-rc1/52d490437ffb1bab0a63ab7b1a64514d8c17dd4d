powerpc/mem: flush_dcache_icache_phys() is for HIGHMEM pages only

__flush_dcache_icache() is usable for non HIGHMEM pages on
every platform.

It is only for HIGHMEM pages that BOOKE needs kmap() and
BOOK3S needs flush_dcache_icache_phys().

So make flush_dcache_icache_phys() dependent on CONFIG_HIGHMEM and
call it only when it is a HIGHMEM page.

We could make flush_dcache_icache_phys() available at all time,
but as it is declared NOKPROBE_SYMBOL(), GCC doesn't optimise
it out when it is not used.

So define a stub for !CONFIG_HIGHMEM in order to remove the #ifdef in
flush_dcache_icache_page() and use IS_ENABLED() instead.
