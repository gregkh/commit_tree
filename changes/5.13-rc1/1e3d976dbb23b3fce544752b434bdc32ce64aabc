flow_dissector: Fix out-of-bounds warning in __skb_flow_bpf_to_target()

Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:

net/core/flow_dissector.c:835:3: warning: 'memcpy' offset [33, 48] from the object at 'flow_keys' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'ipv6_src' with type '__u32[4]' {aka 'unsigned int[4]'} at offset 16 [-Warray-bounds]

The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
memcpy().  So, the compiler legitimately complains about it. As these
are just a couple of members, fix this by copying each one of them in
separate calls to memcpy().

This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().
