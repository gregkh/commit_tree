Makefile: Move -Wno-unused-but-set-variable out of GCC only block

Currently, -Wunused-but-set-variable is only supported by GCC so it is
disabled unconditionally in a GCC only block (it is enabled with W=1).
clang currently has its implementation for this warning in review so
preemptively move this statement out of the GCC only block and wrap it
with cc-disable-warning so that both compilers function the same.
