cifs: don't cargo-cult strndup()

strndup(s, strlen(s)) is a highly unidiomatic way to spell strdup(s);
it's *NOT* safer in any way, since strlen() is just as sensitive to
NUL-termination as strdup() is.

strndup() is for situations when you need a copy of a known-sized
substring, not a magic security juju to drive the bad spirits away.
