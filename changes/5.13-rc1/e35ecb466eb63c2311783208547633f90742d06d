RDMA/iwcm: Allow AFONLY binding for IPv6 addresses

Binding IPv6 address/port to AF_INET6 domain only is provided via
rdma_set_afonly(), but was not signalled to the provider.  Applications
like NFS/RDMA bind the same port to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
simultaneously and thus rely on it working correctly.
