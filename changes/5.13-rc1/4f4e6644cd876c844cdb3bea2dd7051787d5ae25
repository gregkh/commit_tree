media: gscpa/stv06xx: fix memory leak

For two of the supported sensors the stv06xx driver allocates memory which
is stored in sd->sensor_priv. This memory is freed on a disconnect, but if
the probe() fails, then it isn't freed and so this leaks memory.

Add a new probe_error() op that drivers can use to free any allocated
memory in case there was a probe failure.

Thanks to Pavel Skripkin <paskripkin@gmail.com> for discovering the cause
of the memory leak.
