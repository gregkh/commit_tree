RISC-V: Add crash kernel support

This patch allows Linux to act as a crash kernel for use with
kdump. Userspace will let the crash kernel know about the
memory region it can use through linux,usable-memory property
on the /memory node (overriding its reg property), and about the
memory region where the elf core header of the previous kernel
is saved, through a reserved-memory node with a compatible string
of "linux,elfcorehdr". This approach is the least invasive and
re-uses functionality already present.

I tested this on riscv64 qemu and it works as expected, you
may test it by retrieving the dmesg of the previous kernel
through /proc/vmcore, using the vmcore-dmesg utility from
kexec-tools.
