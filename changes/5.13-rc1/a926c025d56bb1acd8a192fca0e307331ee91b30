net: wwan: mhi_wwan_ctrl: Fix RX buffer starvation

The mhi_wwan_rx_budget_dec function is supposed to return true if
RX buffer budget has been successfully decremented, allowing to queue
a new RX buffer for transfer. However the current implementation is
broken when RX budget is '1', in which case budget is decremented but
false is returned, preventing to requeue one buffer, and leading to
RX buffer starvation.
