mm: vmscan: use a new flag to indicate shrinker is registered

Currently registered shrinker is indicated by non-NULL
shrinker->nr_deferred.  This approach is fine with nr_deferred at the
shrinker level, but the following patches will move MEMCG_AWARE
shrinkers' nr_deferred to memcg level, so their shrinker->nr_deferred
would always be NULL.  This would prevent the shrinkers from
unregistering correctly.

Remove SHRINKER_REGISTERING since we could check if shrinker is
registered successfully by the new flag.
