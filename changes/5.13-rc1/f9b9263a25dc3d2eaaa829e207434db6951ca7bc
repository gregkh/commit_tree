staging: rtl8192u: Fix potential infinite loop

The for-loop iterates with a u8 loop counter i and compares this
with the loop upper limit of riv->ieee80211->LinkDetectInfo.SlotNum
that is a u16 type. There is a potential infinite loop if SlotNum
is larger than the u8 loop counter. Fix this by making the loop
counter the same type as SlotNum.
