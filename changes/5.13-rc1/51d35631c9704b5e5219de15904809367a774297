drm/panel-simple: Add N116BCA-EA1

This panel is quite similar to the similarly named N116BGE panel (the
nominal timings are, in fact identical).  However, let's add a new
entry because the full range of clocks listed for N116BGE aren't
supported for N116BCA-EA1, at least according to the datasheet.
