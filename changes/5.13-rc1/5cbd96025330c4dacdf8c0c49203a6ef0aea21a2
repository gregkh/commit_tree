mlxsw: spectrum_qdisc: Allocate child qdiscs dynamically

Instead of keeping qdiscs in globally-preallocated arrays, introduce a
per-qdisc-kind value num_classes, and then allocate the necessary child
qdiscs (if any) based on that value. Since now dynamic allocation is
involved, mlxsw_sp_qdisc_replace() gets messy enough that it is worth it to
split it to two cases: a new qdisc allocation and a change of existing
qdisc. (Note that the change also includes what TC formally calls replace,
if the qdisc kind is the same.)
