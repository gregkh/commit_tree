ext4: make prefetch_block_bitmaps default

Block bitmap prefetching is needed for these allocator optimization
data structures to get populated and provide better group scanning
order. So, turn it on bu default. prefetch_block_bitmaps mount option
is now marked as removed and a new option no_prefetch_block_bitmaps is
added to disable block bitmap prefetching.
