bpf: Refactor btf_check_func_arg_match

This patch moved the subprog specific logic from
btf_check_func_arg_match() to the new btf_check_subprog_arg_match().
The core logic is left in btf_check_func_arg_match() which
will be reused later to check the kernel function call.

The "if (!btf_type_is_ptr(t))" is checked first to improve the
indentation which will be useful for a later patch.

Some of the "btf_kind_str[]" usages is replaced with the shortcut
"btf_type_str(t)".
