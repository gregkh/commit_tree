firmware: qcom-scm: Fix QCOM_SCM configuration

When CONFIG_QCOM_SCM is y and CONFIG_HAVE_ARM_SMCCC
is not set, compiling errors are encountered as follows:

drivers/firmware/qcom_scm-smc.o: In function `__scm_smc_do_quirk':
qcom_scm-smc.c:(.text+0x36): undefined reference to `__arm_smccc_smc'
drivers/firmware/qcom_scm-legacy.o: In function `scm_legacy_call':
qcom_scm-legacy.c:(.text+0xe2): undefined reference to `__arm_smccc_smc'
drivers/firmware/qcom_scm-legacy.o: In function `scm_legacy_call_atomic':
qcom_scm-legacy.c:(.text+0x1f0): undefined reference to `__arm_smccc_smc'

Note that __arm_smccc_smc is defined when HAVE_ARM_SMCCC is y.
So add dependency on HAVE_ARM_SMCCC in QCOM_SCM configuration.
