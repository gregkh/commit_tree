kbuild: add CONFIG_VMLINUX_MAP expert option

It can be quite useful to have ld emit a link map file, in order to
debug or verify that special sections end up where they are supposed
to, and to see what LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION manages to get rid
of.

The only reason I'm not just adding this unconditionally is that the
.map file can be rather large (several MB), and that's a waste of
space when one isn't interested in these things. Also make it depend
on CONFIG_EXPERT.
