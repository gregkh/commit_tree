x86/boot/compressed: Avoid gcc-11 -Wstringop-overread warning

GCC gets confused by the comparison of a pointer to an integer literal,
with the assumption that this is an offset from a NULL pointer and that
dereferencing it is invalid:

  In file included from arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c:18:
  In function ‘parse_elf’,
      inlined from ‘extract_kernel’ at arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c:442:2:
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/../string.h:15:23: error: ‘__builtin_memcpy’ reading 64 bytes from a region of size 0 [-Werror=stringop-overread]
     15 | #define memcpy(d,s,l) __builtin_memcpy(d,s,l)
        |                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c:283:9: note: in expansion of macro ‘memcpy’
    283 |         memcpy(&ehdr, output, sizeof(ehdr));
        |         ^~~~~~

I could not find any good workaround for this, but as this is only
a warning for a failure during early boot, removing the line entirely
works around the warning.
