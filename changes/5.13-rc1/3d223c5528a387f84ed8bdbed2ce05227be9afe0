drm/amd/display: Fixed Clock Recovery Sequence

[Why]
When performing clock recovery, if a pre-emphasis adjustment is
requested, but voltage swing remains constant, the the retry counter
will not be reset. This can lead to prematurely failing link training.

[How]
Reset the clock recovery retry counter if an adjustment is requested
for either voltage swing or pre-emphasis.
