PCI: brcmstb: Use reset/rearm instead of deassert/assert

The Broadcom STB PCIe RC uses a reset control "rescal" for certain chips.
The "rescal" implements a "pulse reset" so using assert/deassert is wrong
for this device.  Instead, we use reset/rearm.  We need to use rearm so
that we can reset it after a suspend/resume cycle; w/o using "rearm", the
"rescal" device will only ever fire once.

Of course for suspend/resume to work we also need to put the reset/rearm
calls in the suspend and resume routines.
