perf build: Regenerate the FEATURE_DUMP file after extra feature checks

Feature detection is done in tools/build/Makefile.feature, we may exit
there with some features not detected and then, in
tools/perf/Makefile.config try adding extra libraries to link and then
do extra feature checks to see if we now find the feature.

This is the case with the disassembler-four-args that checks if the
diassembler() function in libopcodes (binutils) has a signature with
one or with four arguments, as this is not ABI and they changed it at
some point.

This is not a problem when doing normal builds, for instance:

  $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf

As we don't use what is in FEATURE-DUMP at that point, but is a problem
if we pass FEATURE_DUMP=/previously-detected-features as we do in
'make -C tools/perf build-test' to reuse the feature detection in the
many build combinations we test there.

When that is done feature-disassembler-four-args will be set to 0, but
opensuse 15.1 has the four arguments function signature in
disassembler(). The build thus fails.

Fix it by rewriting the FEATURE-DUMP file at the end of
tools/perf/Makefile.config to register features we retested in that make
file.
