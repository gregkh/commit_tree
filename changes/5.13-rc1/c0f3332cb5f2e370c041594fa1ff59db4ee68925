serial: stm32: clean wakeup handling in serial_suspend

Remove useless call to stm32_usart_serial_en_wakeup() routine in suspend
callback. When called with "false" argument, this routine is clearing UESM
and WUFIE bits if usart is not wakeup source. Those bits are already
cleared in set_termios(), and then in serial_resume() callback when usart
is wakeup source.
