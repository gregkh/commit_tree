bpf/selftests: Add bpf_get_task_stack retval bounds verifier test

Add a bpf_iter test which feeds bpf_get_task_stack's return value into
seq_write after confirming it's positive. No attempt to bound the value
from above is made.

Load will fail if verifier does not refine retval range based on
buf sz input to bpf_get_task_stack.
