mlxsw: spectrum_matchall: Split sampling support between ASICs

Sampling of ingress packets is supported using a dedicated sampling
mechanism on all Spectrum ASICs. However, Spectrum-2 and later ASICs
support more sophisticated sampling by mirroring packets to the CPU.

As a preparation for more advanced sampling configurations, split the
sampling operations between Spectrum-1 and later ASICs.
