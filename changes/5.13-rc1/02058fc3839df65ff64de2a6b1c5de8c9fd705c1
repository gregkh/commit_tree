arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: fix number of pins in 'gpio-ranges'

The last cell of 'gpio-ranges' should be number of GPIO pins, and in
case of qcom platform it should match msm_pinctrl_soc_data.ngpio rather
than msm_pinctrl_soc_data.ngpio - 1.

This fixes the problem that when the last GPIO pin in the range is
configured with the following call sequence, it always fails with
-EPROBE_DEFER.

    pinctrl_gpio_set_config()
        pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range()
            pinctrl_match_gpio_range()
