io_uring: Fix premature return from loop and memory leak

Currently the -EINVAL error return path is leaking memory allocated
to data. Fix this by not returning immediately but instead setting
the error return variable to -EINVAL and breaking out of the loop.

Kudos to Pavel Begunkov for suggesting a correct fix.
