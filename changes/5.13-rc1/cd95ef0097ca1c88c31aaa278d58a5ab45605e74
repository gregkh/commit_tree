drm/amd/display: Fix secure display lock problems

[Why]
Find out few locks problems while doing secure display. They are
following few parts:

1. crc_rd_work_lock in amdgpu_dm_crtc_handle_crc_window_irq() should
also use spin_lock_irqsave instead of spin_lock_irq.

2. In crc_win_update_set(), crc_rd_work_lock should be grabbed after
obtaining lock event_lock. Otherwise, will cause deadlock by conflicting
the lock order in amdgpu_dm_crtc_handle_crc_window_irq()

3. flush_work() in crc_win_update_set() is no need and will cause
deadlock since amdgpu_dm_crtc_notify_ta_to_read() also tries to grab
lock crc_rd_work_lock.

[How]
Fix above problems.
