KVM: x86/mmu: Move kvm_mmu_(get|put)_root to TDP MMU

The TDP MMU is almost the only user of kvm_mmu_get_root and
kvm_mmu_put_root. There is only one use of put_root in mmu.c for the
legacy / shadow MMU. Open code that one use and move the get / put
functions to the TDP MMU so they can be extended in future commits.

No functional change intended.
