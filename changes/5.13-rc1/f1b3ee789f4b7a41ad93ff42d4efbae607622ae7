ASoC: soc-core: add comment for rtd freeing

We don't need to mind freeing for rtd,
because it was created from devm_kzalloc(dev, xxx) which is rtd->dev.

This means, if rtd->dev was freed, rtd will be also freed
automatically.

	soc_new_pcm_runtime(...)
	{
		...
		rtd = devm_kzalloc(dev, ...);
		rtd->dev = dev;
		...
	}

This explanation was missing at soc_free_pcm_runtime() comment.
This patch indicates it.
