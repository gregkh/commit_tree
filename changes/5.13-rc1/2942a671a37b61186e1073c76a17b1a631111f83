tools include: Add __sum16 and __wsum definitions.

This adds definitions available in the uapi version.

Explanation:

In the kernel include of types.h the uapi version is included.
In tools the uapi/linux/types.h and linux/types.h are distinct.
For BPF programs a definition of __wsum is needed by the generated
bpf_helpers.h. The definition comes either from a generated vmlinux.h or
from <linux/types.h> that may be transitively included from bpf.h. The
perf build prefers linux/types.h over uapi/linux/types.h for
<linux/types.h>*. To allow tools/perf/util/bpf_skel/bpf_prog_profiler.bpf.c
to compile with the same include path used for perf then these
definitions are necessary.

There is likely a wider conversation about exactly how types.h should be
specified and the include order used by the perf build - it is somewhat
confusing that tools/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h is using the non-uapi
types.h.

*see tools/perf/Makefile.config:
...
INC_FLAGS += -I$(srctree)/tools/include/
INC_FLAGS += -I$(srctree)/tools/arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/uapi
INC_FLAGS += -I$(srctree)/tools/include/uapi
...
The include directories are scanned from left-to-right:

As tools/include/linux/types.h appears before
tools/include/uapi/linux/types.h then I say it is preferred.
