coresight: core: Make symbol 'csdev_sink' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-core.c:26:1: warning:
 symbol '__pcpu_scope_csdev_sink' was not declared. Should it be static?

As csdev_sink is not used outside of coresight-core.c after the
introduction of coresight_[set|get]_percpu_sink() helpers, this
change marks it static.
