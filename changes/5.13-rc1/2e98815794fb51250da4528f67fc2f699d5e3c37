kbuild: dwarf: use AS_VERSION instead of test_dwarf5_support.sh

The test code in scripts/test_dwarf5_support.sh is somewhat difficult
to understand, but after all, we want to check binutils >= 2.35.2

From the former discussion, the requirement for generating DWARF v5 from
C code is as follows:

 - gcc + gnu as          -> requires gcc 5.0+ (but 7.0+ for full support)
 - clang + gnu as        -> requires binutils 2.35.2+
 - clang + integrated as -> OK
