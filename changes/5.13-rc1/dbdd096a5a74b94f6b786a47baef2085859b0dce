KVM: VMX: Intercept FS/GS_BASE MSR accesses for 32-bit KVM

Disable pass-through of the FS and GS base MSRs for 32-bit KVM.  Intel's
SDM unequivocally states that the MSRs exist if and only if the CPU
supports x86-64.  FS_BASE and GS_BASE are mostly a non-issue; a clever
guest could opportunistically use the MSRs without issue.  KERNEL_GS_BASE
is a bigger problem, as a clever guest would subtly be broken if it were
migrated, as KVM disallows software access to the MSRs, and unlike the
direct variants, KERNEL_GS_BASE needs to be explicitly migrated as it's
not captured in the VMCS.
