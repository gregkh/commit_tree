net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: add support for initializing the PPE

The PPE (packet processing engine) is used to offload NAT/routed or even
bridged flows. This patch brings up the PPE and uses it to get a packet
hash. It also contains some functionality that will be used to bring up
flow offloading.
