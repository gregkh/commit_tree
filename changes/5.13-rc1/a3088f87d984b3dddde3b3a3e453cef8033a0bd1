net/mlx5: SF, Split mlx5_sf_hw_table into two parts

Device has SF ids in two different contiguous ranges. One for the local
controller and second for the external controller's PF.

Each such range has its own maximum number of functions and base id.
To allocate SF from either of the range, prepare code to split into
range specific fields into its own structure.
