bus: mhi: core: Hold device wake for channel update commands

MHI host can fail early if device is in a bad state by attempting
to assert device wake and holding the runtime PM vote before
sending a channel update command instead of performing a wake
toggle and waiting for a timeout if the send were to fail. This
can help improve the design and enable shorter wait periods for
device to respond as votes are already held.
