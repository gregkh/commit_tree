drm/encoder: Add macro drmm_plain_encoder_alloc()

This performs the same operation as drmm_encoder_alloc(), but
only allocates and returns a struct drm_encoder instance.

v4: Rename macro drmm_plain_encoder_alloc() and move to
    <drm/drm_encoder.h>. Since it's not "simple" anymore it
    will now take funcs/name arguments as well.
