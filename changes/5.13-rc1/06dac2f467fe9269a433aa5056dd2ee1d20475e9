mm: compaction: update the COMPACT[STALL|FAIL] events properly

By definition, COMPACT[STALL|FAIL] events needs to be counted when there
is 'At least in one zone compaction wasn't deferred or skipped from the
direct compaction'.  And when compaction is skipped or deferred,
COMPACT_SKIPPED will be returned but it will still go and update these
compaction events which is wrong in the sense that COMPACT[STALL|FAIL]
is counted without even trying the compaction.

Correct this by skipping the counting of these events when
COMPACT_SKIPPED is returned for compaction.  This indirectly also avoid
the unnecessary try into the get_page_from_freelist() when compaction is
not even tried.

There is a corner case where compaction is skipped but still count
COMPACTSTALL event, which is that IRQ came and freed the page and the
same is captured in capture_control.
