net: hns3: use netif_tx_disable to stop the transmit queue

Currently, netif_tx_stop_all_queues() is used to ensure that
the xmit is not running, but for the concurrent case it will
not take effect, since netif_tx_stop_all_queues() just sets
a flag without locking to indicate that the xmit queue(s)
should not be run.

So use netif_tx_disable() to replace netif_tx_stop_all_queues(),
it takes the xmit queue lock while marking the queue stopped.
