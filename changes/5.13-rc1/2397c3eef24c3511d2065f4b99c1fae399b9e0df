Revert "mfd: max8997: Add of_compatible to Extcon and Charger mfd_cell"

This reverts commit 9c03008da125c1007919a9186628af3cc105f526.

commit 41a8a027f4d3 ("regulator: dt-bindings: Document charger-supply
for max8997") introduced a binding which uses a property of the max8997
pmic node to configure charger supply, making subnodes for MFD cells
obsolete.
