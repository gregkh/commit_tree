iio: documentation: Document proximity sensor label use

Add an entry to Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio for
the new device label sysfs-attribute support.

And document the standardized labels which may be used with proximity
sensors to hint userspace about the intended use of the sensor.

Using labels to differentiate between the multiple proximity sensors
which a modern laptop/tablet may have was discussed in this thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iio/9f9b0ff6-3bf1-63c4-eb36-901cecd7c4d9@redhat.com/

As mentioned there the "proximity-wifi*" labels are already being used
in this manner on some chromebooks, see e.g.:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sc7180-trogdor.dtsi
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sc7180-trogdor-lte-sku.dtsi

And the "proximity-palmrest" and "proximity-lap" labels are intended
to be used with the lap and palmrest sensors found in recent Lenovo
ThinkPad models.
