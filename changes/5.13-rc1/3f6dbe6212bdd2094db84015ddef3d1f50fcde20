serial: sunsu: drop low-latency workaround

The sunsu driver has been carrying a workaround for the infamous
low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push() by dropping and
reacquiring the port lock in the interrupt handler since 2004.

Since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.
