net/mlx5: Dynamically assign MSI-X vectors count

The number of MSI-X vectors is a PCI property visible through lspci. The
field is read-only and configured by the device. The mlx5 devices work in
a static or dynamic assignment mode.

Static assignment means that all newly created VFs have a preset number of
MSI-X vectors determined by device configuration parameters. This can
result in some VFs having too many or too few MSI-X vectors. Till now this
has been the only means of fine-tuning the MSI-X vector count and it was
acceptable for small numbers of VFs.

With dynamic assignment the inefficiency of having a fixed number of MSI-X
vectors can be avoided with each VF having exactly the required
vectors. Userspace will provide this information while provisioning the VF
for use, based on the intended use. For instance if being used with a VM,
the MSI-X vector count might be matched to the CPU count of the VM.

For compatibility mlx5 continues to start up with MSI-X vector assignment,
but the kernel can now access a larger dynamic vector pool and assign more
vectors to created VFs.
