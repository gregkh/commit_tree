selftests/resctrl: Ensure sibling CPU is not same as original CPU

The resctrl tests can accept a CPU on which the tests are run and use
default of CPU #1 if it is not provided. In the CAT test a "sibling CPU"
is determined that is from the same package where another thread will be
run.

The current algorithm with which a "sibling CPU" is determined does not
take the provided/default CPU into account and when that CPU is the
first CPU in a package then the "sibling CPU" will be selected to be the
same CPU since it starts by picking the first CPU from core_siblings_list.

Fix the "sibling CPU" selection by taking the provided/default CPU into
account and ensuring a sibling that is a different CPU is selected.
