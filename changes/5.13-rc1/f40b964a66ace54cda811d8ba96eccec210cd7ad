io_uring: clean up io_poll_task_func()

io_poll_complete() always fills an event (even an overflowed one), so we
always should do io_cqring_ev_posted() afterwards. And that's what is
currently happening, because second EPOLLONESHOT check is always true,
it can't return !done for oneshots.

Remove those branching, it's much easier to read.
