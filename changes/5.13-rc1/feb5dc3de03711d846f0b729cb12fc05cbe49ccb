Documentation: KVM: Document KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW control flag for arm64

Commit 21b6f32f9471 ("KVM: arm64: guest debug, define API headers") added
the arm64 KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW flag for the KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG ioctl and
commit 834bf88726f0 ("KVM: arm64: enable KVM_CAP_SET_GUEST_DEBUG")
documented and implemented the flag functionality. Since its introduction,
at no point was the flag known by any name other than KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW
for the arm64 architecture, so refer to it as such in the documentation.
