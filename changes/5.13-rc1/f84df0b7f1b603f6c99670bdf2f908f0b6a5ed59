mm/hugeltb: remove redundant VM_BUG_ON() in region_add()

Patch series "Cleanup and fixup for hugetlb", v2.

This series contains cleanups to remove redundant VM_BUG_ON() and simplify
the return code.  Also this handles the error case in
hugetlb_fix_reserve_counts() correctly.  More details can be found in the
respective changelogs.

This patch (of 5):

The same VM_BUG_ON() check is already done in the callee.  Remove this
extra one to simplify the code slightly.
