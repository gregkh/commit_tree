usb: dwc3: trace: Print register read and write offset

Currently dwc3 only prints the virtual address of a register when doing
register read/write. However, these hashed addresses are difficult to read.
Also, since we use %p, we may get some useless (___ptrval___) prints if the
address is not randomized enough. Let's include the register offset to help
read the register read and write tracepoints.
