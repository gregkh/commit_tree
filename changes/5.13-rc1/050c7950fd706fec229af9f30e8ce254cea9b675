ASoC: simple-card-utils: alloc dai_link information for CPU/Codec/Platform

simple-card / audio-graph are assuming single CPU/Codec/Platform on
dai_link. Because of it, it is difficult to support Multi-CPU/Codec.

This patch allocs CPU/Codec/Platform dai_link imformation
instead of using existing props information. It can update to
multi-CPU/Codec, but is still assuming single-CPU/Codec for now.
