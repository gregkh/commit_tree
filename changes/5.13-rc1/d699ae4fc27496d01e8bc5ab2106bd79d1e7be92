ext4: updated locking documentation for journal_t

Some members of transaction_t are allowed to be read without any lock
being held if consistency doesn't matter.  Based on LockDoc's
findings, we extended the locking documentation of those members.
Each one of them is marked with a short comment: "no lock for quick
racy checks".
