tee: optee: fix build error caused by recent optee tracepoints feature

If build kernel without "O=dir", below error will be seen:

In file included from drivers/tee/optee/optee_trace.h:67,
                 from drivers/tee/optee/call.c:18:
./include/trace/define_trace.h:95:42: fatal error: ./optee_trace.h: No such file or directory
   95 | #include TRACE_INCLUDE(TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE)
      |                                          ^
compilation terminated.

Fix it by adding below line to Makefile:
CFLAGS_call.o := -I$(src)

Tested with and without "O=dir", both can build successfully.
