ASoC: rt711-sdca: change capture switch controls

The DAPM event and mixer control could mute/unmute the capture directly.
That will be confused that capture still works if the user settings is unmute before the capture.
Therefore, this patch uses the variables to record the capture switch status of DAPM and mixer.
