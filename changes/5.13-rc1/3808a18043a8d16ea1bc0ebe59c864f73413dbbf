ath11k: fix potential wmi_mgmt_tx_queue race condition

There is a potential race condition between skb_queue_len()
and skb_queue_tail(), the former may get old value before
updated by the latter.

So use skb_queue_len_lockless() instead. And also use '>=',
in case we queue a few SKBs simultaneously.

Found while discussing a similar fix for ath10k:

No functional changes, compile tested only.
