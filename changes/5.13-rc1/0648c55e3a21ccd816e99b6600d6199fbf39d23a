soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Detect truncated read of segments

Given that no validation of how much data the firmware loader read in
for a given segment truncated segment files would best case result in a
hash verification failure, without any indication of what went wrong.

Improve this by validating that the firmware loader did return the
amount of data requested.
