drivers/base/cpu: remove redundant assignment of variable retval

The variable retval is being initialized with a value that is never read
and it is being updated later with a new value.  Clean this up by
initializing retval to -ENOMEM and remove the assignment to retval
on the !dev failure path.

Kudos to Rafael for the improved fix suggestion.
