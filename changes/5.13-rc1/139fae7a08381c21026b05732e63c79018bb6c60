usb: dwc2: Update port suspend/resume function definitions.

Earlier "dwc2_port_suspend()" and "dwc2_port_resume()" functions
were implemented without proper description and host or device mode
difference.

- Added "dwc2_port_suspend" and "dwc2_port_resume" functions to
  "core.h" header file.

- Updated function description in documentation.
