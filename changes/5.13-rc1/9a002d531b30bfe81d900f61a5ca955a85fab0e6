btrfs: integrity-checker: convert block context kmap's to kmap_local_page

btrfsic_read_block() (which calls kmap()) and
btrfsic_release_block_ctx() (which calls kunmap()) are always called
within a single thread of execution.

Therefore the mappings created within these calls can be a thread local
mapping.

Convert the kmap() of bloc_ctx->pagev to kmap_local_page().  Luckily the
unmap loops backwards through the array pointer so no adjustment needs
to be made to the unmapping order.
