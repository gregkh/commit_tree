powerpc/40x: Prepare for enabling MMU in critical exception prolog

In order the enable MMU early in exception prolog, implement
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK principles in critical exception prolog.

There is no intention to use CONFIG_VMAP_STACK on 40x,
but related code will be used to enable MMU early in exception
in a later patch.

Also address (critirq_ctx - PAGE_OFFSET) directly instead of
using tophys() in order to win one instruction.
