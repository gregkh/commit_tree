arm64: mte: Remove unused mte_assign_mem_tag_range()

mte_assign_mem_tag_range() was added in commit 85f49cae4dfc
("arm64: mte: add in-kernel MTE helpers") in 5.11 but moved out of
mte.S by commit 2cb34276427a ("arm64: kasan: simplify and inline
MTE functions") in 5.12 and renamed to mte_set_mem_tag_range().
2cb34276427a did not delete the old function prototypes in mte.h.

Remove the unused prototype from mte.h.
