ACPI: Drop unused ACPI_*_COMPONENT definitions and update documentation

Drop the definitions of the following symbols:

 ACPI_SBS_COMPONENT
 ACPI_FAN_COMPONENT
 ACPI_CONTAINER_COMPONENT
 ACPI_MEMORY_DEVICE_COMPONENT

that are not used in a meaningful way any more and update the ACPI
debug documentation to avoid confusing users by making the impression
that the ACPICA debug can be used for anything other than ACPICA
itself, which is incorrect.

No functional impact.
