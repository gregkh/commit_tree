libbpf: xsk: Remove linux/compiler.h header

In commit 291471dd1559 ("libbpf, xsk: Add libbpf_smp_store_release
libbpf_smp_load_acquire") linux/compiler.h was added as a dependency
to xsk.h, which is the user-facing API. This makes it harder for
userspace application to consume the library. Here the header
inclusion is removed, and instead {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() is added
explicitly.
