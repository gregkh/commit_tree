x86/paravirt: Add new features for paravirt patching

For being able to switch paravirt patching from special cased custom
code sequences to ALTERNATIVE handling some X86_FEATURE_* are needed
as new features. This enables to have the standard indirect pv call
as the default code and to patch that with the non-Xen custom code
sequence via ALTERNATIVE patching later.

Make sure paravirt patching is performed before alternatives patching.
