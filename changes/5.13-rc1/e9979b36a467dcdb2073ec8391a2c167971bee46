io_uring: skip futile iopoll iterations

The only way to get out of io_iopoll_getevents() and continue iterating
is to have empty iopoll_list, otherwise the main loop would just exit.
So, instead of the unlock on 8th time heuristic, do that based on
iopoll_list.

Also, as no one can add new requests to iopoll_list while
io_iopoll_check() hold uring_lock, it's useless to spin with the list
empty, return in that case.
