jump_label: Provide CONFIG-driven build state defaults

As shown in the comment in jump_label.h, choosing the initial state of
static branches changes the assembly layout. If the condition is expected
to be likely it's inline, and if unlikely it is out of line via a jump.

A few places in the kernel use (or could be using) a CONFIG to choose the
default state, which would give a small performance benefit to their
compile-time declared default. Provide the infrastructure to do this.
