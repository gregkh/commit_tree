powerpc: Move ima buffer fields to struct kimage

The fields ima_buffer_addr and ima_buffer_size in "struct kimage_arch"
for powerpc are used to carry forward the IMA measurement list across
kexec system call.  These fields are not architecture specific, but are
currently limited to powerpc.

arch_ima_add_kexec_buffer() defined in "arch/powerpc/kexec/ima.c"
sets ima_buffer_addr and ima_buffer_size for the kexec system call.
This function does not have architecture specific code, but is
currently limited to powerpc.

Move ima_buffer_addr and ima_buffer_size to "struct kimage".
Set ima_buffer_addr and ima_buffer_size in ima_add_kexec_buffer()
in security/integrity/ima/ima_kexec.c.
