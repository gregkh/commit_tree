thermal/core/power_allocator: Maintain the device statistics from going stale

When the temperature is below the first activation trip point the cooling
devices are not checked, so they cannot maintain fresh statistics. It
leads into the situation, when temperature crosses first trip point, the
statistics are stale and show state for very long period. This has impact
on IPA algorithm calculation and wrong decisions. Thus, check the cooling
devices even when the temperature is low, to refresh these statistics.
