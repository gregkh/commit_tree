mm: vmscan: remove memcg_shrinker_map_size

Both memcg_shrinker_map_size and shrinker_nr_max is maintained, but
actually the map size can be calculated via shrinker_nr_max, so it seems
unnecessary to keep both.  Remove memcg_shrinker_map_size since
shrinker_nr_max is also used by iterating the bit map.
