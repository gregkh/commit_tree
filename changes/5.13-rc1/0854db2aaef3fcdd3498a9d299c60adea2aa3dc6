netfilter: nf_tables: use net_generic infra for transaction data

This moves all nf_tables pernet data from struct net to a net_generic
extension, with the exception of the gencursor.

The latter is used in the data path and also outside of the nf_tables
core. All others are only used from the configuration plane.
