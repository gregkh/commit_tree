mtd: parsers: ofpart: make symbol 'bcm4908_partitions_quirks' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/mtd/parsers/ofpart_core.c:25:32: warning:
 symbol 'bcm4908_partitions_quirks' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of ofpart_core.c, so this
commit marks it static.
