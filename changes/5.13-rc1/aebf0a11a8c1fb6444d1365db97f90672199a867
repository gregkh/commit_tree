platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add HID subsystem devices

Add HID subsystem (TC=0x15) devices. These devices need to be registered
for 7th-generation Surface models. On previous generations, these
devices are either provided as platform devices via ACPI (Surface Laptop
1 and 2) or implemented as standard USB device.
