erofs: support parsing big pcluster compress indexes

When INCOMPAT_BIG_PCLUSTER sb feature is enabled, legacy compress indexes
will also have the same on-disk header compact indexes to keep per-file
configurations instead of leaving it zeroed.

If ADVISE_BIG_PCLUSTER is set for a file, CBLKCNT will be loaded for each
pcluster in this file by parsing 1st non-head lcluster.
