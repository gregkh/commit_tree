spi: tools: make a symbolic link to the header file spi.h

The header file spi.h in include/uapi/linux/spi is needed for spidev.h,
so we also need make a symbolic link to it to eliminate the error message
as below:

In file included from spidev_test.c:24:
include/linux/spi/spidev.h:28:10: fatal error: linux/spi/spi.h: No such file or directory
   28 | #include <linux/spi/spi.h>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
