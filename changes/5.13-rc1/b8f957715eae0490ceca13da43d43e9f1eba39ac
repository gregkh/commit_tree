btrfs: support page uptodate assertions in subpage mode

There are quite some assert checks on page uptodate in extent buffer
write accessors.  They ensure the destination page is already uptodate.

This is fine for regular sector size case, but not for subpage case, as
for subpage we only mark the page uptodate if the page contains no hole
and all its extent buffers are uptodate.

So instead of checking PageUptodate(), for subpage case we check the
uptodate bitmap of btrfs_subpage structure.

To make the check more elegant, introduce a helper,
assert_eb_page_uptodate() to do the check for both subpage and regular
sector size cases.

The following functions are involved:

- write_extent_buffer_chunk_tree_uuid()
- write_extent_buffer_fsid()
- write_extent_buffer()
- memzero_extent_buffer()
- copy_extent_buffer()
- extent_buffer_test_bit()
- extent_buffer_bitmap_set()
- extent_buffer_bitmap_clear()
