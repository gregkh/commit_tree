posix-timers: Preserve return value in clock_adjtime32()

The return value on success (>= 0) is overwritten by the return value of
put_old_timex32(). That works correct in the fault case, but is wrong for
the success case where put_old_timex32() returns 0.

Just check the return value of put_old_timex32() and return -EFAULT in case
it is not zero.
