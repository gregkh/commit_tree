media: imx: capture: Decouple video node from source with MC-centric API

When operating in MC-centric mode, the behaviour of video nodes shall
not be influenced by the active configuration of the source subdev. Add
a set of ioctl handlers that implement this mode, and select them when
support for the legacy API is not requested.
