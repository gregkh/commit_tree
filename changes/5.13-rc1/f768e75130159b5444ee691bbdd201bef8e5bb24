enetc: mark TX timestamp type per skb

Mark TX timestamp type per skb on skb->cb[0], instead of
global variable for all skbs. This is a preparation for
one step timestamp support.

For one-step timestamping enablement, there will be both
one-step and two-step PTP messages to transfer. And a skb
queue is needed for one-step PTP messages making sure
start to send current message only after the last one
completed on hardware. (ENETC single-step register has to
be dynamically configured per message.) So, marking TX
timestamp type per skb is required.
