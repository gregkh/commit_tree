mlxsw: spectrum_trap: Split sampling traps between ASICs

Sampling of ingress packets is supported using a dedicated sampling
mechanism on all Spectrum ASICs. However, Spectrum-2 and later ASICs
support more sophisticated sampling by mirroring packets to the CPU.

As a preparation for more advanced sampling configurations, split the trap
configuration used for sampled packets between Spectrum-1 and later ASICs.

This is needed since packets that are mirrored to the CPU are trapped
via a different trap identifier compared to packets that are sampled
using the dedicated sampling mechanism.
