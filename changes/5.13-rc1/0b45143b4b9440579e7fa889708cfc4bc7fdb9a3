x86/platform/uv: Add more to secondary CPU kdump info

Add call to run_crash_ipi_callback() to gather more info of what the
secondary CPUs were doing to help with failure analysis.

Excerpt from Georges:

'It is only changing where crash secondaries will be stalling after
having taken care of properly laying down "crash note regs". Please
note that "crash note regs" are a key piece of data used by crash dump
debuggers to provide a reliable backtrace of running processors.'

Secondary change pursuant to

  a5f526ecb075 ("CodingStyle: Inclusive Terminology"):

change master/slave to main/secondary.
