staging: rtl8192e: remove redundant variable shadowing

In function rtl92e_start_adapter() automatic variable 'i' referenced only
within certain loops, used as iteration counter. Control flow can't get
into such loop w/o 'i = 0' assignment.

It's redundant to shadow this variable by creating scope around loop.

This patch fixes the following sparse warning:

warning: symbol 'i' shadows an earlier one
