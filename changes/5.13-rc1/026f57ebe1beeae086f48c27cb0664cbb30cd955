xfs: get rid of the ip parameter to xchk_setup_*

Now that the scrub context stores a pointer to the file that was used to
invoke the scrub call, the struct xfs_inode pointer that we passed to
all the setup functions is no longer necessary.  This is only ever used
if the caller wants us to scrub the metadata of the open file.
