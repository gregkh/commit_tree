staging: comedi: das800: fix request_irq() warn

request_irq() won't accept a name which contains slash so we need to
replace it with something else -- otherwise it will throw a warning
and the entry in /proc/irq/ will not be created.
Since the .name might be used by userspace and we don't want to break
userspace, so we are changing the parameters passed to request_irq()
