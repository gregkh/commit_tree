coresight: ete: Add support for ETE tracing

Add ETE as one of the supported device types we support
with ETM4x driver. The devices are named following the
existing convention as ete<N>.

ETE mandates that the trace resource status register is programmed
before the tracing is turned on. For the moment simply write to
it indicating TraceActive.
