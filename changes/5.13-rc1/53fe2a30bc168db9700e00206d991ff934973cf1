nvme: do not try to reconfigure APST when the controller is not live

Do not call nvme_configure_apst when the controller is not live, given
that nvme_configure_apst will fail due the lack of an admin queue when
the controller is being torn down and nvme_set_latency_tolerance is
called from dev_pm_qos_hide_latency_tolerance.
