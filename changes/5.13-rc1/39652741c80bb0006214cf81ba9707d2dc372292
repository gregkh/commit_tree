powerpc: Enable passing IMA log to next kernel on kexec

CONFIG_HAVE_IMA_KEXEC is enabled to indicate that the IMA measurement
log information is present in the device tree. This should be selected
only if CONFIG_IMA is enabled.

Update CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE to select CONFIG_HAVE_IMA_KEXEC, if CONFIG_IMA
is enabled, to indicate that the IMA measurement log information is
present in the device tree for powerpc.
