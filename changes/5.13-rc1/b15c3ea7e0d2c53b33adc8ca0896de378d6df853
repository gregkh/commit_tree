ASoC: rt286: Configure combo jack for headphones

During jack detection, the combo jack is configured for a CTIA headset, and
then for an OMTP headset, while sensing the mic connection. If a mic is not
found in either case, the combo jack should be re-configured for headphones
only. This is consistent with the HDA driver behavior.
