selftests/resctrl: Rename CQM test as CMT test

CMT (Cache Monitoring Technology) [1] is a H/W feature that reports cache
occupancy of a process. resctrl selftest suite has a unit test to test CMT
for LLC but the test is named as CQM (Cache Quality Monitoring).
Furthermore, the unit test source file is named as cqm_test.c and several
functions, variables, comments, preprocessors and statements widely use
"cqm" as either suffix or prefix. This rampant misusage of CQM for CMT
might confuse someone who is newly looking at resctrl selftests because
this feature is named CMT in the Intel Software Developer's Manual.

Hence, rename all the occurrences (unit test source file name, functions,
variables, comments and preprocessors) of cqm with cmt.
