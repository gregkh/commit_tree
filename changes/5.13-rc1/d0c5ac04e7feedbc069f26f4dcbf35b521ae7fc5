drm/mcde/panel: Inverse misunderstood flag

A recent patch renaming MIPI_DSI_MODE_EOT_PACKET to
MIPI_DSI_MODE_NO_EOT_PACKET brought to light the
misunderstanding in the current MCDE driver and all
its associated panel drivers that MIPI_DSI_MODE_EOT_PACKET
would mean "use EOT packet" when in fact it means the
reverse.

Fix it up by implementing the flag right in the MCDE
DSI driver and remove the flag from panels that actually
want the EOT packet.
