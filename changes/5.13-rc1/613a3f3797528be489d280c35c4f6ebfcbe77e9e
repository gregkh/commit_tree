KVM: x86/mmu: Use high bits for host/mmu writable masks for EPT SPTEs

Use bits 57 and 58 for HOST_WRITABLE and MMU_WRITABLE when using EPT.
This will allow using bit 11 as a constant MMU_PRESENT, which is
desirable as checking for a shadow-present SPTE is one of the most
common SPTE operations in KVM, particular in hot paths such as page
faults.

EPT is short on low available bits; currently only bit 11 is the only
always-available bit.  Bit 10 is also available, but only while KVM
doesn't support mode-based execution.  On the other hand, PAE paging
doesn't have _any_ high available bits.  Thus, using bit 11 is the only
feasible option for MMU_PRESENT.
