bpf: Document PROG_TEST_RUN limitations

Per net/bpf/test_run.c, particular prog types have additional
restrictions around the parameters that can be provided, so document
these in the header.

I didn't bother documenting the limitation on duration for raw
tracepoints since that's an output parameter anyway.

Tested with ./tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_doc_build.sh.
