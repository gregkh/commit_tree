static_call: Relax static_call_update() function argument type

static_call_update() had stronger type requirements than regular C,
relax them to match. Instead of requiring the @func argument has the
exact matching type, allow any type which C is willing to promote to the
right (function) pointer type. Specifically this allows (void *)
arguments.

This cleans up a bunch of static_call_update() callers for
PREEMPT_DYNAMIC and should get around silly GCC11 warnings for free.
