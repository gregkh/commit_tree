mm/hugeltb: clarify (chg - freed) won't go negative in hugetlb_unreserve_pages()

The resv_map could be NULL since this routine can be called in the evict
inode path for all hugetlbfs inodes and we will have chg = 0 in this case.
But (chg - freed) won't go negative as Mike pointed out:

 "If resv_map is NULL, then no hugetlb pages can be allocated/associated
  with the file.  As a result, remove_inode_hugepages will never find any
  huge pages associated with the inode and the passed value 'freed' will
  always be zero."

Add a comment clarifying this to make it clear and also avoid confusion.
