ASoC: soc-pcm: add error log

cppcheck warning:

sound/soc/soc-pcm.c:1907:6: style: Variable 'err' is assigned a value
that is never used. [unreadVariable]
 err = dpcm_be_dai_hw_free(fe, stream);
     ^

it's not clear why dpcm_be_dai_hw_free() is sometimes called without
testing the error status, and sometimes an error message is provided.

When in doubt, add an error message for consistency. This may have to
be revisited.
