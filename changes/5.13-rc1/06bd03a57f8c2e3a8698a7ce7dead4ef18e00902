selftests/resctrl: Fix MBA/MBM results reporting format

MBM unit test starts fill_buf (default built-in benchmark) in a new con_mon
group (c1, m1) and records resctrl reported mbm values and iMC (Integrated
Memory Controller) values every second. It does this for five seconds
(randomly chosen value) in total. It then calculates average of resctrl_mbm
values and imc_mbm values and if the difference is greater than 300 MB/sec
(randomly chosen value), the test treats it as a failure. MBA unit test is
similar to MBM but after every run it changes schemata.

Checking for a difference of 300 MB/sec doesn't look very meaningful when
the mbm values are changing over a wide range. For example, below are the
values running MBA test on SKL with different allocations

1. With 10% as schemata both iMC and resctrl mbm_values are around 2000
   MB/sec
2. With 100% as schemata both iMC and resctrl mbm_values are around 10000
   MB/sec

A 300 MB/sec difference between resctrl_mbm and imc_mbm values is
acceptable at 100% schemata but it isn't acceptable at 10% schemata because
that's a huge difference.

So, fix this by checking for percentage difference instead of absolute
difference i.e. check if the difference between resctrl_mbm value and
imc_mbm value is within 5% (randomly chosen value) of imc_mbm value. If the
difference is greater than 5% of imc_mbm value, treat it is a failure.
