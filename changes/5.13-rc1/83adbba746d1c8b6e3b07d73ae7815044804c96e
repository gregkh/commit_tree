scsi: lpfc: Fix DMA virtual address ptr assignment in bsg

lpfc_bsg_ct_unsol_event() routine acts assigns a ct_request to the wrong
structure address, resulting in a bad address that results in bsg related
timeouts.

Correct the ct_request assignment to use the kernel virtual buffer address
(not the control structure address).
