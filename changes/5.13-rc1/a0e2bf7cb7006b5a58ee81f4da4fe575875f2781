x86/paravirt: Switch time pvops functions to use static_call()

The time pvops functions are the only ones left which might be
used in 32-bit mode and which return a 64-bit value.

Switch them to use the static_call() mechanism instead of pvops, as
this allows quite some simplification of the pvops implementation.
