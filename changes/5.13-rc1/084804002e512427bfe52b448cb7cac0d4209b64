io_uring: fix leaking reg files on exit

If io_sqe_files_unregister() faults on io_rsrc_ref_quiesce(), it will
fail to do unregister leaving files referenced. And that may well happen
because of a strayed signal or just because it does allocations inside.

In io_ring_ctx_free() do an unsafe version of unregister, as it's
guaranteed to not have requests by that point and so quiesce is useless.
