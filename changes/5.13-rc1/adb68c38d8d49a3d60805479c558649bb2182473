powerpc/papr_scm: Mark nvdimm as unarmed if needed during probe

In case an nvdimm is found to be unarmed during probe then set its
NDD_UNARMED flag before nvdimm_create(). This would enforce a
read-only access to the ndimm region. Presently even if an nvdimm is
unarmed its not marked as read-only on ppc64 guests.

The patch updates papr_scm_nvdimm_init() to force query of nvdimm
health via __drc_pmem_query_health() and if nvdimm is found to be
unarmed then set the nvdimm flag ND_UNARMED for nvdimm_create().
