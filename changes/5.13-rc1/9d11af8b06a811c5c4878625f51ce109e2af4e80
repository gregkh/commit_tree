firmware: qcom_scm: Make __qcom_scm_is_call_available() return bool

Make __qcom_scm_is_call_available() return bool instead of int. The
function has "is" in the name, so it should return a bool to indicate
the truth of the call being available. Unfortunately, it can return a
number < 0 which also looks "true", but not all callers expect that and
thus they think a call is available when really the check to see if the
call is available failed to figure it out.
