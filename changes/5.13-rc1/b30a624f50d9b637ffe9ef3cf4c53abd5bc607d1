fs: dlm: set connected bit after accept

This patch sets the CF_CONNECTED bit when dlm accepts a connection from
another node. If we don't set this bit, next time if the connection
socket gets writable it will assume an event that the connection is
successfully connected. However that is only the case when the
connection did a connect.
