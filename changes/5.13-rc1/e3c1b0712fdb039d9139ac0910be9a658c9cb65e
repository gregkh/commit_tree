drm/amdgpu: Reset the devices in the XGMI hive duirng probe

In passthrough configuration, hypervisior will trigger the SBR(Secondary bus reset) to the devices
without sync to each other. This could cause device hang since for XGMI configuration, all the devices
within the hive need to be reset at a limit time slot. This serial of patches try to solve this issue
by co-operate with new SMU which will only do minimum house keeping to response the SBR request but don't
do the real reset job and leave it to driver. Driver need to do the whole sw init and minimum HW init
to bring up the SMU and trigger the reset(possibly BACO) on all the ASICs at the same time
