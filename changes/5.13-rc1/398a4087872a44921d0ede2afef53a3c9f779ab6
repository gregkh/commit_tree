ARM: dts: rockchip: remove clock-names property from watchdog node in rv1108.dtsi

A test with the command below gives this error:

/arch/arm/boot/dts/rv1108-evb.dt.yaml: watchdog@10360000:
clock-names:0: 'tclk' was expected

Comment from the dw_wdt.c file:

Try to request the watchdog dedicated timer clock source. It must
be supplied if asynchronous mode is enabled. Otherwise fallback
to the common timer/bus clocks configuration, in which the very
first found clock supply both timer and APB signals.

Like in the other Rockchip watchdog nodes the property "clock-names"
is not needed, so remove it.
