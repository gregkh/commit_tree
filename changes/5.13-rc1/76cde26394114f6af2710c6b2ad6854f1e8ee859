irqchip/apple-aic: Add support for the Apple Interrupt Controller

This is the root interrupt controller used on Apple ARM SoCs such as the
M1. This irqchip driver performs multiple functions:

* Handles both IRQs and FIQs

* Drives the AIC peripheral itself (which handles IRQs)

* Dispatches FIQs to downstream hard-wired clients (currently the ARM
  timer).

* Implements a virtual IPI multiplexer to funnel multiple Linux IPIs
  into a single hardware IPI
