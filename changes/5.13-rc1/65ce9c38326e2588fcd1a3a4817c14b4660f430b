kbuild: move module strip/compression code into scripts/Makefile.modinst

Both mod_strip_cmd and mod_compress_cmd are only used in
scripts/Makefile.modinst, hence there is no good reason to define them
in the top Makefile. Move the relevant code to scripts/Makefile.modinst.

Also, show separate log messages for each of install, strip, sign, and
compress.
