soundwire: qcom: add static port map support

SoundWire device ports are statically mapped to Controller ports during
design. Add support to read these from SoundWire devices.
This controller uses static port map info to setup bandwidth
parameters for those ports.

A generic port allocation is not possible in this cases!
