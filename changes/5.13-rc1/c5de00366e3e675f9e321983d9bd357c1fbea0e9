io_uring: move poll update into remove not add

Having poll update function as a part of IORING_OP_POLL_ADD is not
great, we have to do hack around struct layouts and add some overhead in
the way of more popular POLL_ADD. Even more serious drawback is that
POLL_ADD requires file and always grabs it, and so poll update, which
doesn't need it.

Incorporate poll update into IORING_OP_POLL_REMOVE instead of
IORING_OP_POLL_ADD. It also more consistent with timeout remove/update.
