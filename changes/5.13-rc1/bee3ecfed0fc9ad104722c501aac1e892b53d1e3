platform/mellanox: mlxreg-hotplug: move to use request_irq by IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag

disable_irq() after request_irq() still has a time gap in which
interrupts can come. request_irq() with IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag will
disable IRQ auto-enable because of requesting.

this patch is made base on "add IRQF_NO_AUTOEN for request_irq" which
is being merged: https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1388765/
