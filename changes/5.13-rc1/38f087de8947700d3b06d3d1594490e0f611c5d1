devtmpfs: fix placement of complete() call

Calling complete() from within the __init function is wrong -
theoretically, the init process could proceed all the way to freeing
the init mem before the devtmpfsd thread gets to execute the return
instruction in devtmpfs_setup().

In practice, it seems to be harmless as gcc inlines devtmpfs_setup()
into devtmpfsd(). So the calls of the __init functions init_chdir()
etc. actually happen from devtmpfs_setup(), but the __ref on that one
silences modpost (it's all right, because those calls happen before
the complete()). But it does make the __init annotation of the setup
function moot, which we'll fix in a subsequent patch.
