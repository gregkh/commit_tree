serial: imx: drop workaround for forced irq threading

Force-threaded interrupt handlers used to run with interrupts enabled,
something which could lead to deadlocks in case a threaded handler
shared a lock with code running in hard interrupt context (e.g. timer
callbacks) and did not explicitly disable interrupts.

This was specifically the case for serial drivers that take the port
lock in their console write path as printk can be called from hard
interrupt context also with forced threading ("threadirqs").

Since commit 81e2073c175b ("genirq: Disable interrupts for force
threaded handlers") interrupt handlers always run with interrupts
disabled on non-RT so that drivers no longer need to do handle this.

Drop the now obsolete workaround added by commit 33f16855dcb9 ("tty:
serial: imx: fix potential deadlock").
