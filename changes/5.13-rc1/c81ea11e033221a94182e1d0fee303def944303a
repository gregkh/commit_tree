xfs: xfs_buf_item_size_segment() needs to pass segment offset

Otherwise it doesn't correctly calculate the number of vectors
in a logged buffer that has a contiguous map that gets split into
multiple regions because the range spans discontigous memory.

Probably never been hit in practice - we don't log contiguous ranges
on unmapped buffers (inode clusters).
