icmp: standardize naming of RFC 8335 PROBE constants

The current definitions of constants for PROBE, currently defined only
in the net-next kernel branch, are inconsistent, with
some beginning with ICMP and others with simply EXT. This patch
attempts to standardize the naming conventions of the constants for
PROBE before their release into a stable Kernel, and to update the
relevant definitions in net/ipv4/icmp.c.

Similarly, the definitions for the code field (previously
ICMP_EXT_MAL_QUERY, etc) use the same prefixes as the type field. This
patch adds _CODE_ to the prefix to clarify the distinction of these
constants.
