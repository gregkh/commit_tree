libbpf: Generalize BTF and BTF.ext type ID and strings iteration

Extract and generalize the logic to iterate BTF type ID and string offset
fields within BTF types and .BTF.ext data. Expose this internally in libbpf
for re-use by bpf_linker.

Additionally, complete strings deduplication handling for BTF.ext (e.g., CO-RE
access strings), which was previously missing. There previously was no
case of deduplicating .BTF.ext data, but bpf_linker is going to use it.
