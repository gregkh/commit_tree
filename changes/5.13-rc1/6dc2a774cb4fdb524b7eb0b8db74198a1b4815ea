x86/Hyper-V: Support for free page reporting

Linux has support for free page reporting now (36e66c554b5c) for
virtualized environment. On Hyper-V when virtually backed VMs are
configured, Hyper-V will advertise cold memory discard capability,
when supported. This patch adds the support to hook into the free
page reporting infrastructure and leverage the Hyper-V cold memory
discard hint hypercall to report/free these pages back to the host.
