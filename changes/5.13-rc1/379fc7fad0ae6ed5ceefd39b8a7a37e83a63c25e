ceph: use attach/detach_page_private for tracking snap context

There is some ambiguity around the use of PagePrivate. It's
generally expected in core code that if PagePrivate is set then
you have a reference to it. It's not clear that ceph always
does (and I believe it may not).

Change ceph to use attach/detach_page_private so that we keep a
reference to the page until the snap context is detached.
