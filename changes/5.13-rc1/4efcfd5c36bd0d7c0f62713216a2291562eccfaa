mt76: mt7615: load ROM patch before checking patch semaphore status

For MT7663, the availability of the patch files is used to detect, which
corresponding firmware is going to be used (AP firmware or STA offload
firmware). If the ROM patch was already applied, it could attempt to
load the wrong firmware (without considering the alternative).
