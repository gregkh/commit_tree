ASoC: samsung: tm2_wm5110: check of of_parse return value

cppcheck warning:

sound/soc/samsung/tm2_wm5110.c:605:6: style: Variable 'ret' is
reassigned a value before the old one has been
used. [redundantAssignment]
 ret = devm_snd_soc_register_component(dev, &tm2_component,
     ^
sound/soc/samsung/tm2_wm5110.c:554:7: note: ret is assigned
  ret = of_parse_phandle_with_args(dev->of_node, "i2s-controller",
      ^
sound/soc/samsung/tm2_wm5110.c:605:6: note: ret is overwritten
 ret = devm_snd_soc_register_component(dev, &tm2_component,
     ^

The args is a stack variable, so it could have junk (uninitialized)
therefore args.np could have a non-NULL and random value even though
property was missing. Later could trigger invalid pointer dereference.

There's no need to check for args.np because args.np won't be
initialized on errors.
