drm/i915: Handle async cancellation in sentinel assert

With the watchdog cancelling requests asynchronously to preempt-to-busy we
need to relax one assert making it apply only to requests not in error.

v2:
 * Check against the correct request!

v3:
 * Simplify the check to avoid the question of when to sample the fence
   error vs sentinel bit.
