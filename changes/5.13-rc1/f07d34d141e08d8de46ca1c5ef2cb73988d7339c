media: staging: media: atomisp: Don't abort on error in module exit path

The function lm3554_remove() checks for the return code for
lm3554_gpio_uninit() even though this is on the exit path and exits the
function, leaving the variable flash unfreed. Print a warning instead
and free flash unconditionally.
