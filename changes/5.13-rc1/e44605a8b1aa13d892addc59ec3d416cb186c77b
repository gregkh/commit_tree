selftests/vm: gup_test: test faulting in kernel, and verify pinnable pages

When pages are pinned they can be faulted in userland and migrated, and
they can be faulted right in kernel without migration.

In either case, the pinned pages must end-up being pinnable (not
movable).

Add a new test to gup_test, to help verify that the gup/pup
(get_user_pages() / pin_user_pages()) behavior with respect to pinnable
and movable pages is reasonable and correct.  Specifically, provide a
way to:

1) Verify that only "pinnable" pages are pinned.  This is checked
   automatically for you.

2) Verify that gup/pup performance is reasonable.  This requires
   comparing benchmarks between doing gup/pup on pages that have been
   pre-faulted in from user space, vs.  doing gup/pup on pages that are
   not faulted in until gup/pup time (via FOLL_TOUCH).  This decision is
   controlled with the new -z command line option.
