swiotlb: move orig addr and size validation into swiotlb_bounce

Move the code to find and validate the original buffer address and size
from the callers into swiotlb_bounce.  This means a tiny bit of extra
work in the swiotlb_map path, but avoids code duplication and a leads to
a better code structure.
