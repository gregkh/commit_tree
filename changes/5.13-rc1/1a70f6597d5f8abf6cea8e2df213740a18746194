net: Remove redundant assignment to err

Variable 'err' is set to -ENOMEM but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence the 'If statements' and
assignments are redundantand and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

net/ipv6/seg6.c:126:4: warning: Value stored to 'err' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
