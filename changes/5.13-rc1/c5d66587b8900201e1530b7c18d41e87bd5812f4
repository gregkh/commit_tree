net: ethernet: mediatek: ppe: fix busy wait loop

The intention is for the loop to timeout if the body does not succeed.
The current logic calls time_is_before_jiffies(timeout) which is false
until after the timeout, so the loop body never executes.

Fix by using readl_poll_timeout as a more standard and less error-prone
solution.
