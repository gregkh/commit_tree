RISC-V: Add kdump support

This patch adds support for kdump, the kernel will reserve a
region for the crash kernel and jump there on panic. In order
for userspace tools (kexec-tools) to prepare the crash kernel
kexec image, we also need to expose some information on
/proc/iomem for the memory regions used by the kernel and for
the region reserved for crash kernel. Note that on userspace
the device tree is used to determine the system's memory
layout so the "System RAM" on /proc/iomem is ignored.

I tested this on riscv64 qemu and works as expected, you may
test it by triggering a crash through /proc/sysrq_trigger:

echo c > /proc/sysrq_trigger
