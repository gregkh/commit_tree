PCI/sysfs: Convert "rom" to static attribute

The "rom" sysfs attribute allows access to the PCI Option ROM.  Previously
it was dynamically created either by pci_bus_add_device() or the
pci_sysfs_init() initcall, but since it doesn't need to be created or
removed dynamically, we can use a static attribute so the device model
takes care of addition and removal automatically.

Convert "rom" to a static attribute and use the .is_bin_visible() callback
to set the correct object size based on the ROM size.

Remove "rom_attr" from the struct pci_dev since it is no longer needed.

This attribute was added in the pre-git era by https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/drivers/pci/pci-sysfs.c?id=f6d553444da2
