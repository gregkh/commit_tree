cifs: cifspdu.h: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Also, this helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by
fixing the following warning:

  CC [M]  fs/cifs/cifssmb.o
fs/cifs/cifssmb.c: In function ‘CIFSFindNext’:
fs/cifs/cifssmb.c:4636:23: warning: array subscript 1 is above array bounds of ‘char[1]’ [-Warray-bounds]
 4636 |   pSMB->ResumeFileName[name_len+1] = 0;
      |   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~
