s390/pci: deconfigure device on release

When zpci_release_device() is called on a zPCI function that is still
configured it would not be deconfigured. Until now this hasn't caused
any problems because zpci_zdev_put() is only ever called for devices
in Standby or Reserved. Fix it by adding sclp_pci_deconfigure() to the
switch when in Configured state.
