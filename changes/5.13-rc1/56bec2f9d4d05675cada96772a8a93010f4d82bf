powerpc/mm/64s: Add _PAGE_KERNEL_ROX

In the past we had a fallback definition for _PAGE_KERNEL_ROX, but we
removed that in commit d82fd29c5a8c ("powerpc/mm: Distribute platform
specific PAGE and PMD flags and definitions") and added definitions
for each MMU family.

However we missed adding a definition for 64s, which was not really a
bug because it's currently not used.

But we'd like to use PAGE_KERNEL_ROX in a future patch so add a
definition now.
