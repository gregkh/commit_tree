bpf, xdp: Restructure redirect actions

The XDP_REDIRECT implementations for maps and non-maps are fairly
similar, but obviously need to take different code paths depending on
if the target is using a map or not. Today, the redirect targets for
XDP either uses a map, or is based on ifindex.

Here, the map type and id are added to bpf_redirect_info, instead of
the actual map. Map type, map item/ifindex, and the map_id (if any) is
passed to xdp_do_redirect().

For ifindex-based redirect, used by the bpf_redirect() XDP BFP helper,
a special map type/id are used. Map type of UNSPEC together with map id
equal to INT_MAX has the special meaning of an ifindex based
redirect. Note that valid map ids are 1 inclusive, INT_MAX exclusive
([1,INT_MAX[).

In addition to making the code easier to follow, using explicit type
and id in bpf_redirect_info has a slight positive performance impact
by avoiding a pointer indirection for the map type lookup, and instead
use the cacheline for bpf_redirect_info.

Since the actual map is not passed via bpf_redirect_info anymore, the
map lookup is only done in the BPF helper. This means that the
bpf_clear_redirect_map() function can be removed. The actual map item
is RCU protected.

The bpf_redirect_info flags member is not used by XDP, and not
read/written any more. The map member is only written to when
required/used, and not unconditionally.
