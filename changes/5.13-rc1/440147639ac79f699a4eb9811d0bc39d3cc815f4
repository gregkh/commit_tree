soc: mediatek: mmsys: Use an array for setting the routing registers

Actually, setting the registers for routing, use multiple 'if-else' for different
routes, but this code would be more and more complicated while we
support more and more SoCs. Change that and use a table per SoC so the
code will be more portable and clear.
