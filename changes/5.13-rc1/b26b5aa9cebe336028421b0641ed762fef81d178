tipc: move creation of publication item one level up in call chain

We instantiate struct publication in tipc_nametbl_insert_publ()
instead of as currently in tipc_service_insert_publ(). This has the
advantage that we can pass a pointer to the publication struct to
the next call levels, instead of the numerous individual parameters
we pass on now. It also gives us a location to keep the contents of
the additional fields we will introduce in a later commit.
