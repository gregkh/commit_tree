erofs: fix up inplace I/O pointer for big pcluster

When picking up inplace I/O pages, it should be traversed in reverse
order in aligned with the traversal order of file-backed online pages.
Also, index should be updated together when preloading compressed pages.

Previously, only page-sized pclustersize was supported so no problem
at all. Also rename `compressedpages' to `icpage_ptr' to reflect its
functionality.
