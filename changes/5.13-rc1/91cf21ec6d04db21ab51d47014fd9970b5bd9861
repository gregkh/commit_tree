scsi: zfcp: Remove unneeded INIT_LIST_HEAD() for FSF requests

INIT_LIST_HEAD() is only needed for actual list heads, while req->list is
used as a list entry.

Note that when the error path in zfcp_fsf_req_send() removes the request
from the adapter's list of pending requests, it actually looks up the
request from the zfcp_reqlist - rather than just calling list_del().  So
there's no risk of us calling list_del() on a request that hasn't been
added to any list yet.
