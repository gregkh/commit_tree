RDMA/rtrs: Use new shared CQ mechanism

Have the driver use shared CQs which provids a ~10%-20% improvement during
test.

Instead of opening a CQ for each QP per connection, a CQ for each QP will
be provided by the RDMA core driver that will be shared between the QPs on
that core reducing interrupt overhead.
