iio:adc:ad7476: Fix remove handling

This driver was in an odd half way state between devm based cleanup
and manual cleanup (most of which was missing).
I would guess something went wrong with a rebase or similar.
Anyhow, this basically finishes the job as a precursor to improving
the regulator handling.
