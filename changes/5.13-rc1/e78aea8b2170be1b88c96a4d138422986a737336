bpf: tcp: Put some tcp cong functions in allowlist for bpf-tcp-cc

This patch puts some tcp cong helper functions, tcp_slow_start()
and tcp_cong_avoid_ai(), into the allowlist for the bpf-tcp-cc
program.

A few tcp cc implementation functions are also put into the
allowlist.  A potential use case is the bpf-tcp-cc implementation
may only want to override a subset of a tcp_congestion_ops.  For others,
the bpf-tcp-cc can directly call the kernel counter parts instead of
re-implementing (or copy-and-pasting) them to the bpf program.

They will only be available to the bpf-tcp-cc typed program.
The allowlist functions are not bounded to a fixed ABI contract.
When any of them has changed, the bpf-tcp-cc program has to be changed
like any in-tree/out-of-tree kernel tcp-cc implementations do also.
