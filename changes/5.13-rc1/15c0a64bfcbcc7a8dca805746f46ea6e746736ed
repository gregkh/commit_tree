net: netrom: nr_in: Remove redundant assignment to ns

Variable ns is set to 'skb->data[17]' but this value is never read as
it is overwritten or not used later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

net/netrom/nr_in.c:156:2: warning: Value stored to 'ns' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
