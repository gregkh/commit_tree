ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix silent headphone output on ASUS UX430UA

It was reported that the headphone output on ASUS UX430UA (SSID
1043:1740) with ALC295 codec is silent while the speaker works.
After the investigation, it turned out that the DAC assignment has to
be fixed on this machine; unlike others, it expects DAC 0x02 to be
assigned to the speaker pin 0x07 while DAC 0x03 to headphone pin
0x21.

This patch provides a fixup for the fixed DAC/pin mapping for this
device.
