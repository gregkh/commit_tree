io_uring: fix POLL_REMOVE removing apoll

Don't allow REQ_OP_POLL_REMOVE to kill apoll requests, users should not
know about it. Also, remove weird -EACCESS in io_poll_update(), it
shouldn't know anything about apoll, and have to work even if happened
to have a poll and an async poll'ed request with same user_data.

Fixes: b69de288e913 ("io_uring: allow events and user_data update of running poll requests")
