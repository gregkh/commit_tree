usb: gadget/function/f_fs string table fix for multiple languages

Fixes bug with the handling of more than one language in
the string table in f_fs.c.
str_count was not reset for subsequent language codes.
str_count-- "rolls under" and processes u32 max strings on
the processing of the second language entry.
The existing bug can be reproduced by adding a second language table
to the structure "strings" in tools/usb/ffs-test.c.
