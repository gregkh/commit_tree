iio: gp2ap020a00f: Remove code to set trigger parent

iio_trigger_set_drvdata() sets the trigger device parent to first
argument of viio_trigger_alloc(), no need to do it again in the driver
code.

Given data->client is client, and we call devm_iio_trigger_alloc() with
&client->dev, we do not have to set data->trig->dev.parent to
&data->client->dev anymore.
