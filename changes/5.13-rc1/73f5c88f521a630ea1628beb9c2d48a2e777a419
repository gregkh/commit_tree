NFSv4.2 fix handling of sr_eof in SEEK's reply

Currently the client ignores the value of the sr_eof of the SEEK
operation. According to the spec, if the server didn't find the
requested extent and reached the end of the file, the server
would return sr_eof=true. In case the request for DATA and no
data was found (ie in the middle of the hole), then the lseek
expects that ENXIO would be returned.
