usb: misc: ehset: update to use the usb_control_msg_{send|recv}() API

The newer usb_control_msg_{send|recv}() API ensures that a short read
is treated as an error, data can be used off the stack, and raw usb
pipes need not be created in the calling functions.
For this reason, instances of usb_control_msg() have been replaced with
usb_control_msg_{recv|send}() appropriately.

Now, we also test for a short device descriptor (which USB core
should already have fetched if you get to probe this driver), but which
wasn't verified again here before.
