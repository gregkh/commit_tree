USB: serial: xr: move pin configuration to probe

There's no need to configure the pins on every open and judging from the
vendor driver and datasheet it can be done before enabling the UART.

Move pin configuration from open() to port probe and make sure to
deassert DTR and RTS after configuring all pins as GPIO.
