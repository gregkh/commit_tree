f2fs: introduce gc_merge mount option

In this patch, we will add two new mount options: "gc_merge" and
"nogc_merge", when background_gc is on, "gc_merge" option can be
set to let background GC thread to handle foreground GC requests,
it can eliminate the sluggish issue caused by slow foreground GC
operation when GC is triggered from a process with limited I/O
and CPU resources.

Original idea is from Xiang.
