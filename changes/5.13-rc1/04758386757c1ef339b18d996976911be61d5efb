backlight: journada720: Fix Wmisleading-indentation warning

With gcc-11, we get a warning about code that looks correct
but badly indented:

drivers/video/backlight/jornada720_bl.c: In function ‘jornada_bl_update_status’:
drivers/video/backlight/jornada720_bl.c:66:11: error: this ‘else’ clause does not guard... [-Werror=misleading-indentation]
   66 |         } else  /* turn on backlight */
      |           ^~~~

Change the formatting according to our normal conventions.
