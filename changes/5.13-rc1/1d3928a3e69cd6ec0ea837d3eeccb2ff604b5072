pinctrl: renesas: Add support for R-Car SoCs with pull-down only pins

Currently, the common R-Car bias handling supports pin controllers with
either:
  1. Separate pin Pull-Enable (PUEN) and pin Pull-Up/Down control (PUD)
     registers, for controlling both pin pull-up and pin pull-down,
  2. A single pin Pull-Up control register (PUPR), for controlling pin
     pull-up.

Add support for a variant of #2, where some bits in the single pin
Pull-Up control register (PUPR) control pin pull-down instead of pin
pull-up.  This is the case for the "ASEBRK#/ACK" pin on R-Car M2-W,
M2-N, and E2, and the "ACK" pin on RZ/G1M, RZ/G1N, RZ/G1E, and RZ/G1C.
To describe such a register, SoC-specific drivers need to provide two
instances of pinmux_bias_reg: a first one with the puen field filled in,
listing pins with pull-up functionality, and a second one with the pud
field filled in, listing pins with pull-down functionality.
