tty: amiserial: add missing TIOCSSERIAL jiffies conversions

The tty-port close_delay and closing_wait parameters set by TIOCSSERIAL
are specified in jiffies, while the values returned by TIOCGSERIAL are
specified in centiseconds.

Add the missing conversions so that TIOCSSERIAL works as expected also
if this code is ever reused on a system where HZ is not 100.
