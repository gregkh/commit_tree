iio: proximity: Add a ChromeOS EC MKBP proximity driver

Add support for a ChromeOS EC proximity driver that exposes a "front"
proximity sensor via the IIO subsystem. The EC decides when front
proximity is near and sets an MKBP switch 'EC_MKBP_FRONT_PROXIMITY' to
notify the kernel of proximity. Similarly, when proximity detects
something far away it sets the switch bit to 0. For now this driver
exposes a single sensor, but it could be expanded in the future via more
MKBP bits if desired.
