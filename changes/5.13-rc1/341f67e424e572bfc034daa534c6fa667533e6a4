net: stmmac: Add hardware supported cross-timestamp

Cross timestamping is supported on Integrated Ethernet Controller in
Intel SoC such as EHL and TGL with Always Running Timer.

The hardware cross-timestamp result is made available to
applications through the PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE ioctl which calls
stmmac_getcrosststamp().

Device time is stored in the MAC Auxiliary register. The 64-bit System
time (ART timestamp) is stored in registers that are only addressable
by using MDIO space.
