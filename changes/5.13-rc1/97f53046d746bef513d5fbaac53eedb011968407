ASoC: SOF: remove superfluous NULL check in debugfs read

When reading from IPC flood debugfs entries no need to check whether
.cache_buf is NULL - it's impossible since otherwise the initialisation
would have failed. This also fixes a klocwork reported issue:

passed to function and may be dereferenced there by passing argument 2
to function 'memcpy' at line 510.
