clk: uniphier: Fix potential infinite loop

The for-loop iterates with a u8 loop counter i and compares this
with the loop upper limit of num_parents that is an int type.
There is a potential infinite loop if num_parents is larger than
the u8 loop counter. Fix this by making the loop counter the same
type as num_parents.  Also make num_parents an unsigned int to
match the return type of the call to clk_hw_get_num_parents.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Infinite loop")
