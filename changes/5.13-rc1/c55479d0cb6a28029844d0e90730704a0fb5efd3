net/mlx5: E-Switch, Change mode lock from mutex to rw semaphore

E-Switch mode change routine will take the write lock to prevent any
consumer to access the E-Switch resources while E-Switch is going
through a mode change.

In the next patch
E-Switch consumers (e.g vport representors) will take read_lock prior to
accessing E-Switch resources to prevent E-Switch mode changing in the
middle of the operation.
