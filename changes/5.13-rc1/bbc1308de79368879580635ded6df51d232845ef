iio: kfifo: mask flags without zero-check in devm_iio_kfifo_buffer_setup()

As pointed by Lars, this doesn't require a zero-check. Also, while looking
at this a little closer at it (again), the masking can be done later, as
there is a zero-check for 'mode_flags' anyway, which returns -EINVAL. And
we only need the 'mode_flags' later in the logic.

This change is more of a tweak.
