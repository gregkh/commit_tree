net: enetc: clean the TX software BD on the TX confirmation path

With the future introduction of some new fields into enetc_tx_swbd such
as is_xdp_tx, is_xdp_redirect etc, we need not only to set these bits
to true from the XDP_TX/XDP_REDIRECT code path, but also to false from
the old code paths.

This is because TX software buffer descriptors are kept in a ring that
is shadow of the hardware TX ring, so these structures keep getting
reused, and there is always the possibility that when a software BD is
reused (after we ran a full circle through the TX ring), the old user of
the tx_swbd had set is_xdp_tx = true, and now we are sending a regular
skb, which would need to set is_xdp_tx = false.

To be minimally invasive to the old code paths, let's just scrub the
software TX BD in the TX confirmation path (enetc_clean_tx_ring), once
we know that nobody uses this software TX BD (tx_ring->next_to_clean
hasn't yet been updated, and the TX paths check enetc_bd_unused which
tells them if there's any more space in the TX ring for a new enqueue).
