KVM: SVM: Allocate SEV command structures on local stack

Use the local stack to "allocate" the structures used to communicate with
the PSP.  The largest struct used by KVM, sev_data_launch_secret, clocks
in at 52 bytes, well within the realm of reasonable stack usage.  The
smallest structs are a mere 4 bytes, i.e. the pointer for the allocation
is larger than the allocation itself.

Now that the PSP driver plays nice with vmalloc pointers, putting the
data on a virtually mapped stack (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y) will not cause
explosions.
