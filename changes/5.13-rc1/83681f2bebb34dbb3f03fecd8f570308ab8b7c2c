crypto: api - check for ERR pointers in crypto_destroy_tfm()

Given that crypto_alloc_tfm() may return ERR pointers, and to avoid
crashes on obscure error paths where such pointers are presented to
crypto_destroy_tfm() (such as [0]), add an ERR_PTR check there
before dereferencing the second argument as a struct crypto_tfm
pointer.
