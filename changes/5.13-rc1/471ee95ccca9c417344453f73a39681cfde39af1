scsi: target: tcmu: Adjust parameter in call to tcmu_blocks_release()

In commit f7c89771d07d ("scsi: target: tcmu: Replace radix_tree with
XArray") the meaning of last parameter of tcmu_blocks_release() was
changed.  So in the callers we should subtract 1 from the previous
parameter.

Unfortunately that change got lost at one of the two places where
tcmu_blocks_release() is called. That does not lead to any problems, but we
should adjust it anyway.
