KVM: SVM: Pass struct kvm_vcpu to exit handlers (and many, many other places)

Refactor the svm_exit_handlers API to pass @vcpu instead of @svm to
allow directly invoking common x86 exit handlers (in a future patch).
Opportunistically convert an absurd number of instances of 'svm->vcpu'
to direct uses of 'vcpu' to avoid pointless casting.

No functional change intended.
