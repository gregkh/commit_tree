net: sched: tapr: prevent cycle_time == 0 in parse_taprio_schedule

There is a reproducible sequence from the userland that will trigger a WARN_ON()
condition in taprio_get_start_time, which causes kernel to panic if configured
as "panic_on_warn". Catch this condition in parse_taprio_schedule to
prevent this condition.
