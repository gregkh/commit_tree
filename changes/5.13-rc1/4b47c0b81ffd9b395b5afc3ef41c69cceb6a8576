net: enetc: don't initialize unused ports from a separate code path

Since commit 3222b5b613db ("net: enetc: initialize RFS/RSS memories for
unused ports too") there is a requirement to initialize the memories of
unused PFs too, which has left the probe path in a bit of a rough shape,
because we basically have a minimal initialization path for unused PFs
which is separate from the main initialization path.

Now that initializing a control BD ring is as simple as calling
enetc_setup_cbdr, let's move that outside of enetc_alloc_si_resources
(unused PFs don't need classification rules, so no point in allocating
them just to free them later).

But enetc_alloc_si_resources is called both for PFs and for VFs, so now
that enetc_setup_cbdr is no longer called from this common function, it
means that the VF probe path needs to explicitly call enetc_setup_cbdr
too.
