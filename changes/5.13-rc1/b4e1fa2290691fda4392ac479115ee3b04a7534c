kselftest/arm64: mte: Fix clang warning

if (!prctl(...) == 0) is not only cumbersome to read, it also upsets
clang and triggers a warning:
------------
mte_common_util.c:287:6: warning: logical not is only applied to the
left hand side of this comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
....

Fix that by just comparing against "not 0" instead.
