rpmsg: virtio: Register the rpmsg_char device

Instantiate the rpmsg_char device on virtio RPMsg bus creation.
This provides the capability, with the RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL ioctl,
to create RPMsg char device endpoints relying on the
rpmsg_chrdev_create_eptdev API.

Notice that the created endpoints are attached to the rpmsg_ctldev
device, but not associated to a channel.
As consequence, the endpoint source and destination addresses have to
been specified and there is no channel creation and no name service
announcement to inform the remote side.
