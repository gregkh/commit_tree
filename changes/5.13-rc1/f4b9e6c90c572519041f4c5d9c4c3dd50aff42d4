nvme: use driver pdu command for passthrough

All nvme transport drivers preallocate an nvme command for each request.
Assume to use that command for nvme_setup_cmd() instead of requiring
drivers pass a pointer to it. All nvme drivers must initialize the
generic nvme_request 'cmd' to point to the transport's preallocated
nvme_command.

The generic nvme_request cmd pointer had previously been used only as a
temporary copy for passthrough commands. Since it now points to the
command that gets dispatched, passthrough commands must directly set it
up prior to executing the request.
