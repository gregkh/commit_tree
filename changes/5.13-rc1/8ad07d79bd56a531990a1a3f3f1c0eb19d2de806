spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: transmit dummy circles by using the controller's internal functionality

There is a data corruption issue that occurs in the reading operation
(cmd:0x6c) when transmitting common data as dummy circles.

The gqspi controller has the functionality to send dummy clock circles.
When writing data with the fields [receive, transmit, data_xfer] = [0,0,1]
to the Generic FIFO, and configuring the correct SPI mode, the controller
will transmit dummy circles.

So let's switch to hardware dummy cycles transfer to fix this issue.
