ALSA: hda: Revert "ALSA: hda: Allow setting preallocation again for x86"

This reverts commit f8e4ae10de43 ("ALSA: hda: Allow setting
preallocation again for x86").

The reverted commit itself is a revert of c31427d0d21e ("ALSA: hda: No
preallocation on x86 platforms"). It was needed because HDA allowed very
big allocations, up to 1GB per stream. However as previous commit in
this series changes maximum allowed allocation per stream to 4MB, we can
safely revert it back.

On systems where there are a lot of FrontEnds, when
CONFIG_SND_HDA_PREALLOC_SIZE != 0  ALSA core allocates memory for each
FE, which may cause out of memory problems due to per card limit. Force
config to 0 on X86, so memory will be allocated on as needed basis.
