drm/i915: Disable runtime power management during shutdown

At least on some TGL platforms PUNIT wants to access some display HW
registers, but it doesn't handle display power management (disabling DC
states as required) and so this register access will lead to a hang. To
prevent this disable runtime power management for poweroff and reboot.

v2:
- Add code comment clarifying the requirement of display power states.
