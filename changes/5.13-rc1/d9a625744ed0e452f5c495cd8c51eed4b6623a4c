iio: core: merge buffer/ & scan_elements/ attributes

With this change, we create a new directory for the IIO device called
buffer0, under which both the old buffer/ and scan_elements/ are stored.

This is done to simplify the addition of multiple IIO buffers per IIO
device. Otherwise we would need to add a bufferX/ and scan_elementsX/
directory for each IIO buffer.
With the current way of storing attribute groups, we can't have directories
stored under each other (i.e. scan_elements/ under buffer/), so the best
approach moving forward is to merge their attributes.

The old/legacy buffer/ & scan_elements/ groups are not stored on the opaque
IIO device object. This way the IIO buffer can have just a single
attribute_group object, saving a bit of memory when adding multiple IIO
buffers.
