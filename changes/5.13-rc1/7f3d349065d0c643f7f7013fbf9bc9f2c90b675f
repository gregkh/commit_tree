riscv: Use $(LD) instead of $(CC) to link vDSO

Currently, the VDSO is being linked through $(CC). This does not match
how the rest of the kernel links objects, which is through the $(LD)
variable.

When linking with clang, there are a couple of warnings about flags that
will not be used during the link:

clang-12: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-no-pie' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]
clang-12: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pg' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]

'-no-pie' was added in commit 85602bea297f ("RISC-V: build vdso-dummy.o
with -no-pie") to override '-pie' getting added to the ld command from
distribution versions of GCC that enable PIE by default. It is
technically no longer needed after commit c2c81bb2f691 ("RISC-V: Fix the
VDSO symbol generaton for binutils-2.35+"), which removed vdso-dummy.o
in favor of generating vdso-syms.S from vdso.so with $(NM) but this also
resolves the issue in case it ever comes back due to having full control
over the $(LD) command. '-pg' is for function tracing, it is not used
during linking as clang states.

These flags could be removed/filtered to fix the warnings but it is
easier to just match the rest of the kernel and use $(LD) directly for
linking. See commits

  fe00e50b2db8 ("ARM: 8858/1: vdso: use $(LD) instead of $(CC) to link VDSO")
  691efbedc60d ("arm64: vdso: use $(LD) instead of $(CC) to link VDSO")
  2ff906994b6c ("MIPS: VDSO: Use $(LD) instead of $(CC) to link VDSO")
  2b2a25845d53 ("s390/vdso: Use $(LD) instead of $(CC) to link vDSO")

for more information.

The flags are converted to linker flags and '--eh-frame-hdr' is added to
match what is added by GCC implicitly, which can be seen by adding '-v'
to GCC's invocation.

Additionally, since this area is being modified, use the $(OBJCOPY)
variable instead of an open coded $(CROSS_COMPILE)objcopy so that the
user's choice of objcopy binary is respected.
