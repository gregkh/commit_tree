ata: ahci: ceva: Update the driver to support xilinx GT phy

SATA controller used in Xilinx ZynqMP platform uses xilinx GT phy
which has 4 GT lanes and can be used by 4 peripherals at a time.
SATA controller uses 1 GT phy lane among the 4 GT lanes. To configure
the GT lane for the SATA controller, the below sequence is expected.

1. Assert the SATA controller reset.
2. Configure the xilinx GT phy lane for SATA controller (phy_init).
3. De-assert the SATA controller reset.
4. Wait for PLL of the GT lane used by SATA to be locked (phy_power_on).

The ahci_platform_enable_resources() by default does the phy_init()
and phy_power_on() but the default sequence doesn't work with Xilinx
platforms. Because of this reason, updated the driver to support the
new sequence.

Added cevapriv->rst check, for backward compatibility with the older
sequence. If the reset controller is not available, then the SATA
controller will configure with the older sequences.
