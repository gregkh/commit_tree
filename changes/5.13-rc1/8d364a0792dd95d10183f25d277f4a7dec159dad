KVM: SVM: Append "_enabled" to module-scoped SEV/SEV-ES control variables

Rename sev and sev_es to sev_enabled and sev_es_enabled respectively to
better align with other KVM terminology, and to avoid pseudo-shadowing
when the variables are moved to sev.c in a future patch ('sev' is often
used for local struct kvm_sev_info pointers.

No functional change intended.
