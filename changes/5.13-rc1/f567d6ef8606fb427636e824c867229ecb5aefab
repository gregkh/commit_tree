HID: plantronics: Workaround for double volume key presses

Plantronics Blackwire 3220 Series (047f:c056) sends HID reports twice
for each volume key press. This patch adds a quirk to hid-plantronics
for this product ID, which will ignore the second volume key press if
it happens within 5 ms from the last one that was handled.

The patch was tested on the mentioned model only, it shouldn't affect
other models, however, this quirk might be needed for them too.
Auto-repeat (when a key is held pressed) is not affected, because the
rate is about 3 times per second, which is far less frequent than once
in 5 ms.
