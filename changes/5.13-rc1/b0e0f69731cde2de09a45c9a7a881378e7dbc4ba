ovl: restrict lower null uuid for "xino=auto"

Commit a888db310195 ("ovl: fix regression with re-formatted lower
squashfs") attempted to fix a regression with existing setups that
use a practice that we are trying to discourage.

The discourage part was described this way in the commit message:
"To avoid the reported regression while still allowing the new features
 with single lower squashfs, do not allow decoding origin with lower null
 uuid unless user opted-in to one of the new features that require
 following the lower inode of non-dir upper (index, xino, metacopy)."

The three mentioned features are disabled by default in Kconfig, so
it was assumed that if they are enabled, the user opted-in for them.
Apparently, distros started to configure CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_XINO_AUTO=y
some time ago, so users upgrading their kernels can still be affected
by said regression even though they never opted-in for any new feature.

To fix this, treat "xino=on" as "user opted-in", but not "xino=auto".
Since we are changing the behavior of "xino=auto" to no longer follow
to lower origin with null uuid, take this one step further and disable
xino in that corner case.  To be consistent, disable xino also in cases
of lower fs without file handle support and upper fs without xattr
support.

Update documentation w.r.t the new "xino=auto" behavior and fix the out
dated bits of documentation regarding "xino" and regarding offline
modifications to lower layers.
