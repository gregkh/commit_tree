staging: rtl8188eu: move static array from .h to .c

Declaring a static array in a header file is likely to cause name conflicts
if the declaration is pulled in multiple times.

The rtl8188 driver protects the declaration of the wlancmds array in
rtw_mlme_ext.h with ifdef _RTW_CMD_C_, which is defined only in rtw_cmd.c.
It makes more sense to declare the array in the .c file.
