futex: Do not apply time namespace adjustment on FUTEX_LOCK_PI

FUTEX_LOCK_PI does not require to have the FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME bit set
because it has been using CLOCK_REALTIME based absolute timeouts
forever. Due to that, the time namespace adjustment which is applied when
FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME is not set, will wrongly take place for FUTEX_LOCK_PI
and wreckage the timeout.

Exclude it from that procedure.
