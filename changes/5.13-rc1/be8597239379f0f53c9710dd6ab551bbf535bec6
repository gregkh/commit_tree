Bluetooth: initialize skb_queue_head at l2cap_chan_create()

syzbot is hitting "INFO: trying to register non-static key." message [1],
for "struct l2cap_chan"->tx_q.lock spinlock is not yet initialized when
l2cap_chan_del() is called due to e.g. timeout.

Since "struct l2cap_chan"->lock mutex is initialized at l2cap_chan_create()
immediately after "struct l2cap_chan" is allocated using kzalloc(), let's
as well initialize "struct l2cap_chan"->{tx_q,srej_q}.lock spinlocks there.
