serial: timbuart: drop low-latency workaround

The timbuart driver has always carried a workaround for the infamous
low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push() which required not
holding the port lock when the low_latency flag was set.

Since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks
around.
