selinux: add proper NULL termination to the secclass_map permissions

This patch adds the missing NULL termination to the "bpf" and
"perf_event" object class permission lists.

This missing NULL termination should really only affect the tools
under scripts/selinux, with the most important being genheaders.c,
although in practice this has not been an issue on any of my dev/test
systems.  If the problem were to manifest itself it would likely
result in bogus permissions added to the end of the object class;
thankfully with no access control checks using these bogus
permissions and no policies defining these permissions the impact
would likely be limited to some noise about undefined permissions
during policy load.
