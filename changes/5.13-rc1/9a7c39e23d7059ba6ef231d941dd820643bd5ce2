mtd: rawnand: qcom: Convert nandc to chip in Read/Write helper

This change will convert nandc to chip in Read/Write helper, this
change is needed because if we wnated to access number of steps
in Read/Write helper then we need to get the chip->ecc.steps,
currentlly its not possible.After this change we can directly
acces chip->ecc.steps in Read/Write helper.
