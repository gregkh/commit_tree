firmware: raspberrypi: Keep count of all consumers

When unbinding the firmware device we need to make sure it has no
consumers left. Otherwise we'd leave them with a firmware handle
pointing at freed memory.

Keep a reference count of all consumers and introduce rpi_firmware_put()
which will permit automatically decrease the reference count upon
unbinding consumer drivers.
