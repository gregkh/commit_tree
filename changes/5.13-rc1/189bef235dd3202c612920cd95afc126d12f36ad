arm64: dts: allwinner: Move wakeup-capable IRQs to r_intc

All IRQs that can be used to wake up the system must be routed through
r_intc, so they are visible to firmware while the system is suspended.

In addition to the external NMI input, which is already routed through
r_intc, these include PIO and R_PIO (gpio-keys), the LRADC, and the RTC.
