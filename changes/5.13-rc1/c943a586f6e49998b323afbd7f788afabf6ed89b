ASoC: SOF: match SSP config with pcm hw params

This patch adds a function to find a match between pcm hw params and SSP
DAI config. Config is matched against sample rate and if match is found
current config is set. If match isn't found last matched config is left
as current i.e. current config is not touched. Functionality for SSP
DAIs with 1 config remains the same as before.
