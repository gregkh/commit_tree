firmware: arm_scmi: Extend protocol registration interfaces

Extend common protocol registration routines and provide some new generic
protocols get/put helpers that can track protocols usage and automatically
perform the proper initialization and de-initialization on demand when
required.

Convert all standard protocols to use this new registration scheme while
keeping them all still using the usual initialization logic bound to SCMI
devices probing.
