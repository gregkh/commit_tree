arm64: dts: ti: k3-am65-mcu: Add RTI watchdog entry

Add the DT entry for a watchdog based on RTI1.

On SR1.0 silicon, it requires additional firmware on the MCU R5F cores
to handle the expiry, e.g. https://github.com/siemens/k3-rti-wdt. As
this firmware will also lock the power domain to protect it against
premature shutdown, mark it shared.
