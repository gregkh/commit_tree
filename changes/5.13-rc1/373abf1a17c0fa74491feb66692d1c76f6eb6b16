drm/i915: Convert INTEL_GEN() to DISPLAY_VER() as appropriate in i915_irq.c

Convert the display-specific usage of INTEL_GEN, while leaving the
non-display usage as-is for now.

In the near-future we'll probably want to think about moving display
interrupt handling to its own file under the display/ directory.

v2:
 - Use new IS_DISPLAY_VER() macro.
