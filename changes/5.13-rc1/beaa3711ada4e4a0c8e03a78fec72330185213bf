libbpf: Factor out symtab and relos sanity checks

Factor out logic for sanity checking SHT_SYMTAB and SHT_REL sections into
separate sections. They are already quite extensive and are suffering from too
deep indentation. Subsequent changes will extend SYMTAB sanity checking
further, so it's better to factor each into a separate function.

No functional changes are intended.
