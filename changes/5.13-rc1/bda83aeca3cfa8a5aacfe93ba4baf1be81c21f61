thunderbolt: Do not pass timeout for tb_cfg_reset()

There is only one user for this function and it passes the default
timeout to it anyway, so remove the parameter completely. This is also
needed in the subsequent patch where we allow connection manager
implementations to use different timeout for non-raw control channel
messages.
