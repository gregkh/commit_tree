bus: mhi: core: Check state before processing power_down

We cannot process a power_down if the power state is DISABLED.  There is
no valid mhi_ctxt in that case, so attepting to process the power_down
will likely result in a null pointer dereference.  If the power state is
DISABLED, there is nothing to do anyways, so just bail early.
