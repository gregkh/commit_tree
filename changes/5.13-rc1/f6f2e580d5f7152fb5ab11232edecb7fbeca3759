netfilter: conntrack: move expect counter to net_generic data

Creation of a new conntrack entry isn't a frequent operation (compared
to 'ct entry already exists').  Creation of a new entry that is also an
expected (related) connection even less so.

Place this counter in net_generic data.

A followup patch will also move the conntrack count -- this will make
netns_ct a read-mostly structure.
