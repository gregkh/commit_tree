rculist: Replace reference to atomic_ops.rst

The hlist_nulls_for_each_entry_rcu() docbook header references the
atomic_ops.rst file, which was removed in commit f0400a77ebdc ("atomic:
Delete obsolete documentation").  This commit therefore substitutes a
section in memory-barriers.txt discussing the use of barrier() in loops.
