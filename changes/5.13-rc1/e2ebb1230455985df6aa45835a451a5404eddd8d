ext2: Match up ext2_put_page() with ext2_dotdot() and ext2_find_entry()

ext2_dotdot() and ext2_find_entry() both require ext2_put_page() to be
called after successful return.  For some of the calls this
corresponding put was hidden in ext2_set_link and ext2_delete_entry().

Match up ext2_put_page() with ext2_dotdot() and ext2_find_entry() in the
functions which call them.  This makes the code easier to follow
regarding the get/put of the page.

Clean up comments to match new behavior.
