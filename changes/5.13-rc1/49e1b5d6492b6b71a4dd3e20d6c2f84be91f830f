media: imx: capture: Add a mechanism to disable control inheritance

Add a parameter to the imx_media_capture_device_init() function to
select between the legacy and MC-centric API. When selecting the
MC-centric API, the video node doesn't inherit controls from subdevs
anymore. All callers are updated to use the legacy API for now,
preserving the existing behaviour.
