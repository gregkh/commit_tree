habanalabs: support legacy and new pll indexes

In order to use minimum of hard coded values common to LKD and F/W
a dynamic method to work with PLLs is introduced in this patch.
Formerly asic specific PLL numbering is now common for all asics.
To be backward compatible a bit in dev status is defined, if the bit is
not set LKD will keep working with old PLL numbering.
