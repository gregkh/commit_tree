arm64: dts: qcom: Add sc7180-trogdor-pompom skus

This is a trogdor variant.  This is mostly a grab from the downstream
tree with notable exceptions:
- I skip -rev0.  This was a super early build and there's no advantage
  of long term support.
- In -rev1 I translate the handling of the USB hub like is done for
  similar boards.  See the difference between the downstream and
  upstream 'sc7180-trogdor-lazor-r0.dts' for an example.  This will
  need to be resolved when proper support for the USB hub is figured
  out upstream.
- I remove sound node since sound hasn't landed upstream yet.
- In incorporate the pending <https://crrev.com/c/2719075> for the
  keyboard.
