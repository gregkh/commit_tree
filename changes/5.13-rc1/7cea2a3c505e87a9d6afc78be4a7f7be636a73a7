fanotify: support limited functionality for unprivileged users

Add limited support for unprivileged fanotify groups.
An unprivileged users is not allowed to get an open file descriptor in
the event nor the process pid of another process.  An unprivileged user
cannot request permission events, cannot set mount/filesystem marks and
cannot request unlimited queue/marks.

This enables the limited functionality similar to inotify when watching a
set of files and directories for OPEN/ACCESS/MODIFY/CLOSE events, without
requiring SYS_CAP_ADMIN privileges.

The FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME init flag, provide a method for an unprivileged
listener watching a set of directories (with FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD) to monitor
all changes inside those directories.

This typically requires that the listener keeps a map of watched directory
fid to dirfd (O_PATH), where fid is obtained with name_to_handle_at()
before starting to watch for changes.

When getting an event, the reported fid of the parent should be resolved
to dirfd and fstatsat(2) with dirfd and name should be used to query the
state of the filesystem entry.
