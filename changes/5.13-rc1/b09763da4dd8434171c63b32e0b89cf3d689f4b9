KVM: x86/mmu: Add module param to disable MMIO caching (for testing)

Add a module param to disable MMIO caching so that it's possible to test
the related flows without access to the necessary hardware.  Using shadow
paging with 64-bit KVM and 52 bits of physical address space must disable
MMIO caching as there are no reserved bits to be had.
