drm/amdgpu: Ensure that the modifier requested is supported by plane.

On initializing the framebuffer, call drm_any_plane_has_format to do a
check if the modifier is supported. drm_any_plane_has_format calls
dm_plane_format_mod_supported which is extended to validate that the
modifier is on the list of the plane's supported modifiers.

The bug was caught using igt-gpu-tools test: kms_addfb_basic.addfb25-bad-modifier

Tested on ChromeOS Zork by turning on the display, running an overlay
test, and running a YT video.

=== Changes from v1 ===
Explicitly handle DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID modifier.
