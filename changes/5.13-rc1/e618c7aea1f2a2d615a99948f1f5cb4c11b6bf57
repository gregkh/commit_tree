powerpc/mem: Call flush_coherent_icache() at higher level

flush_coherent_icache() doesn't need the address anymore,
so it can be called immediately when entering the public
functions and doesn't need to be disseminated among
lower level functions.

And use page_to_phys() instead of open coding the calculation
of phys address to call flush_dcache_icache_phys().
