thermal/core: Remove thermal_notify_framework

thermal_notify_framework just updates for a single trip point where as
thermal_zone_device_update does other bookkeeping like updating the
temperature of the thermal zone and setting the next trip point. The only
driver that was using thermal_notify_framework was updated in the previous
patch to use thermal_zone_device_update instead. Since there are no users
for thermal_notify_framework remove it.
