mptcp: move flags and ifindex out of mptcp_addr_info

This patch moved the flags and ifindex fields from struct mptcp_addr_info
to struct mptcp_pm_addr_entry. Add the flags and ifindex values as two new
parameters to __mptcp_subflow_connect.

In mptcp_pm_create_subflow_or_signal_addr, pass the local address entry's
flags and ifindex fields to __mptcp_subflow_connect.

In mptcp_pm_nl_add_addr_received, just pass two zeros to it.
