scsi: lpfc: Fix dropped FLOGI during pt2pt discovery recovery

When connected in pt2pt mode, there is a scenario where the remote port
significantly delays sending a response to our FLOGI, but acts on the FLOGI
it sent us and proceeds to PLOGI/PRLI.  The FLOGI ends up timing out and
kicks off recovery logic. End result is a lot of unnecessary state changes
and lots of discovery messages being logged.

Fix by terminating the FLOGI and noop'ing its completion if we have already
accepted the remote ports FLOGI and are now processing PLOGI.
