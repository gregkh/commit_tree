kexec: Use fdt_appendprop_addrrange() to add ima buffer to FDT

fdt_appendprop_addrrange() function adds a property, with the given name,
to the device tree at the given node offset, and also sets the address
and size of the property.  This function should be used to add
"linux,ima-kexec-buffer" property to the device tree and set the address
and size of the IMA measurement buffer, instead of using custom function.

Use fdt_appendprop_addrrange() to add  "linux,ima-kexec-buffer" property
to the device tree.  This property holds the address and size of
the IMA measurement buffer that needs to be passed from the current
kernel to the next kernel across kexec system call.

Remove custom code that is used in setup_ima_buffer() to add
"linux,ima-kexec-buffer" property to the device tree.
