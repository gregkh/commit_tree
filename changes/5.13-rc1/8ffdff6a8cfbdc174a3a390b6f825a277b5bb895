staging: comedi: move out of staging directory

The comedi code came into the kernel back in 2008, but traces its
lifetime to much much earlier.  It's been polished and buffed and
there's really nothing preventing it from being part of the "real"
portion of the kernel.

So move it to drivers/comedi/ as it belongs there.

Many thanks to the hundreds of developers who did the work to make this
happen.
