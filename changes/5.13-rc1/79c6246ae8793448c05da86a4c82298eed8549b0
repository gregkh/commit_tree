spi: stm32: Fix use-after-free on unbind

stm32_spi_remove() accesses the driver's private data after calling
spi_unregister_master() even though that function releases the last
reference on the spi_master and thereby frees the private data.

Fix by switching over to the new devm_spi_alloc_master() helper which
keeps the private data accessible until the driver has unbound.
