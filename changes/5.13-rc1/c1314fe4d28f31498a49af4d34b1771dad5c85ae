staging: rtl8723bs: remove all RT_TRACE logs in hal/ and os_dep/

Remove all of the RT_TRACE logs in hal/ and os_dep/ files as they
currently do nothing as they require the code to be modified by
hand in order to be turned on. This obviously has not happened
since the code was merged. Moreover it relies on an unneeded
private log level tracing which overrides the in-kernel public one,
so just remove them as they are unused.

This bulk remove has been done with the following semantic
patch:

@@
expression a, b, c;
@@

-	RT_TRACE(a, b, (c));
