sctp: Fix out-of-bounds warning in sctp_process_asconf_param()

Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:

net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c:3150:4: warning: 'memcpy' offset [17, 28] from the object at 'addr' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'v4' with type 'struct sockaddr_in' at offset 0 [-Warray-bounds]

This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().
