drm/i915/gen9_bc: Introduce TGP PCH DDC pin mappings

With the introduction of gen9_bc, where Intel combines Cometlake CPUs with
a Tigerpoint PCH, we'll need to introduce new DDC pin mappings for this
platform in order to make all of the display connectors work. So, let's do
that.

Changes since v4:
* Split this into it's own patch - vsyrjala
Changes since v5:
* Rename gen9bc_port_to_ddc_pin() to gen9bc_tgp_port_to_ddc_pin()
