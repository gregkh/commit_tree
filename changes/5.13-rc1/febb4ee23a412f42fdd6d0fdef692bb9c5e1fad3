pinctrl: PINCTRL_ROCKCHIP should depend on ARCH_ROCKCHIP

The Rockchip GPIO and pin control modules are only present on Rockchip
SoCs.  Hence add a dependency on ARCH_ROCKCHIP, to prevent asking the
user about this driver when configuring a kernel without Rockchip
platform support.

Note that before, the PINCTRL_ROCKCHIP symbol was not visible, and
automatically selected when needed.  By making it tristate and
user-selectable, it became visible for everyone.
