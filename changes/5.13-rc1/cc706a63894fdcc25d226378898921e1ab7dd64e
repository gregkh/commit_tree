KVM: arm64: Avoid free_page() in page-table allocator

Currently, the KVM page-table allocator uses a mix of put_page() and
free_page() calls depending on the context even though page-allocation
is always achieved using variants of __get_free_page().

Make the code consistent by using put_page() throughout, and reduce the
memory management API surface used by the page-table code. This will
ease factoring out page-allocation from pgtable.c, which is a
pre-requisite to creating page-tables at EL2.
