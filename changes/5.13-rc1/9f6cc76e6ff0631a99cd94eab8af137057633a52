erofs: introduce physical cluster slab pools

Since multiple pcluster sizes could be used at once, the number of
compressed pages will become a variable factor. It's necessary to
introduce slab pools rather than a single slab cache now.

This limits the pclustersize to 1M (Z_EROFS_PCLUSTER_MAX_SIZE), and
get rid of the obsolete EROFS_FS_CLUSTER_PAGE_LIMIT, which has no
use now.
