drm/msm/dpu: Delete bonkers code

dpu_crtc_atomic_flush() was directly poking it's attached planes in a
code path that ended up in dpu_plane_atomic_update(), even if the plane
was not involved in the current atomic update.  While a bit dubious,
this worked before because plane->state would always point to something
valid.  But now using drm_atomic_get_new_plane_state() we could get a
NULL state pointer instead, leading to:

The reason for the codepath seems dubious, the atomic suspend/resume
heplers should handle the power-collapse case.  If not, the CRTC's
atomic_check() should be adding the planes to the atomic update.
