KVM: x86/mmu: Fix and unconditionally enable WARNs to detect PAE leaks

Exempt NULL PAE roots from the check to detect leaks, since
kvm_mmu_free_roots() doesn't set them back to INVALID_PAGE.  Stop hiding
the WARNs to detect PAE root leaks behind MMU_WARN_ON, the hidden WARNs
obviously didn't do their job given the hilarious number of bugs that
could lead to PAE roots being leaked, not to mention the above false
positive.

Opportunistically delete a warning on root_hpa being valid, there's
nothing special about 4/5-level shadow pages that warrants a WARN.
