usb: gadget: pch_udc: Revert d3cb25a12138 completely

The commit d3cb25a12138 ("usb: gadget: udc: fix spin_lock in pch_udc")
obviously was not thought through and had made the situation even worse
than it was before. Two changes after almost reverted it. but a few
leftovers have been left as it. With this revert d3cb25a12138 completely.

While at it, narrow down the scope of unlocked section to prevent
potential race when prot_stall is assigned.
