ASoC: ti: omap-mcsp: remove duplicate test

cppcheck warning:

sound/soc/ti/omap-mcbsp.c:379:11: style: The if condition is the same
as the previous if condition [duplicateCondition]

 if (mcbsp->irq) {
          ^
sound/soc/ti/omap-mcbsp.c:376:11: note: First condition
 if (mcbsp->irq)
          ^
sound/soc/ti/omap-mcbsp.c:379:11: note: Second condition
 if (mcbsp->irq) {
          ^

Keeping two separate tests was probably intentional for clarity, but
since this generates warnings we might as well make cppcheck happy so
that we have fewer warnings.
