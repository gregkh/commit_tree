PM: hibernate: x86: Use crc32 instead of md5 for hibernation e820 integrity check

Hibernation fails on a system in fips mode because md5 is used for the e820
integrity check and is not available. Use crc32 instead.

The check is intended to detect whether the E820 memory map provided
by the firmware after cold boot unexpectedly differs from the one that
was in use when the hibernation image was created. In this case, the
hibernation image cannot be restored, as it may cover memory regions
that are no longer available to the OS.

A non-cryptographic checksum such as CRC-32 is sufficient to detect such
inadvertent deviations.
