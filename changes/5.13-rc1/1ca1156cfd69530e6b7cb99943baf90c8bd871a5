ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Register clocks before registering component

Clock registration must be performed before the component is
registered.  aic32x4_component_probe attempts to get all the
clocks right off the bat.  If the component is registered before
the clocks there is a race condition where the clocks may not
be registered by the time aic32x4_componet_probe actually runs.
