scsi: target: core: Move t_task_cdb initialization

Prepare to split target_submit_cmd_map_sgls() so the initialization and
submission part can be called at different times. If the init part fails we
can reference the t_task_cdb early in some of the logging and tracing
code. Move it to transport_init_se_cmd() so we don't hit NULL pointer
crashes.
