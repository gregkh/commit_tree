perf/x86/intel/uncore: Generic support for the PCI type of uncore blocks

The discovery table provides the generic uncore block information
for the PCI type of uncore blocks, which is good enough to provide
basic uncore support.

The PCI BUS and DEVFN information can be retrieved from the box control
field. Introduce the uncore_pci_pmus_register() to register all the
PCICFG type of uncore blocks. The old PCI probe/remove way is dropped.

The PCI BUS and DEVFN information are different among dies. Add box_ctls
to store the box control field of each die.

Add a new BUS notifier for the PCI type of uncore block to support the
hotplug. If the device is "hot remove", the corresponding registered PMU
has to be unregistered. Perf cannot locate the PMU by searching a const
pci_device_id table, because the discovery tables don't provide such
information. Introduce uncore_pci_find_dev_pmu_from_types() to search
the whole uncore_pci_uncores for the PMU.

Implement generic support for the PCI type of uncore block.
