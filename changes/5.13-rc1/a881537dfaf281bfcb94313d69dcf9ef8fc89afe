Revert "mtd: rawnand: bbt: Skip bad blocks when searching for the BBT in NAND"

This reverts commit bd9c9fe2ad04546940f4a9979d679e62cae6aa51.

Since commit bd9c9fe2ad04 ("mtd: rawnand: bbt: Skip bad blocks when
searching for  the BBT in NAND") the bad block table cannot be found
on a imx27-phytec-phycard-s-rdk board:

Bad block table not found for chip 0
Bad block table not found for chip 0

Revert it for now, until a better solution can be found.
