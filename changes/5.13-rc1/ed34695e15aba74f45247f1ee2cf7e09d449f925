pNFS/flexfiles: fix incorrect size check in decode_nfs_fh()

We (adam zabrocki, alexander matrosov, alexander tereshkin, maksym
bazalii) observed the check:

	if (fh->size > sizeof(struct nfs_fh))

should not use the size of the nfs_fh struct which includes an extra two
bytes from the size field.

struct nfs_fh {
	unsigned short         size;
	unsigned char          data[NFS_MAXFHSIZE];
}

but should determine the size from data[NFS_MAXFHSIZE] so the memcpy
will not write 2 bytes beyond destination.  The proposed fix is to
compare against the NFS_MAXFHSIZE directly, as is done elsewhere in fs
code base.
