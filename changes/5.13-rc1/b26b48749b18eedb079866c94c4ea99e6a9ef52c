soundwire: qcom: use signed variable for error return

We get warning of using a unsigned variable being compared to less than
zero. The comparison is correct as it checks for errors from previous
call to qcom_swrm_get_alert_slave_dev_num(), so we should use a signed
variable here.

While at it, drop the superfluous initialization as well

drivers/soundwire/qcom.c: qcom_swrm_irq_handler() warn: impossible
condition '(devnum < 0) => (0-255 < 0)'
