platform/x86: dell-wmi-sysman: Cleanup sysman_init() error-exit handling

Cleanup sysman_init() error-exit handling:

1. There is no need for the fail_reset_bios and fail_authentication_kset
   eror-exit cases, these can be handled by release_attributes_data()

2. Rename all the labels from fail_what_failed, to err_what_to_cleanup
   this is the usual way to name these and avoids the need to rename
   them when extra steps are added.
