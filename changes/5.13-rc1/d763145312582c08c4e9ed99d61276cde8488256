ALSA: usb-audio: Skip probe of UA-101 devices

UA-101 device and co are supported by another driver, snd-ua101, but
the USB audio class driver (snd-usb-audio) catches all and this
resulted in the lack of functionality like missing MIDI devices.

This patch introduces a sort of deny-listing for those devices to just
return -ENODEV at probe in snd-usb-audio driver, so that it falls back
to the probe by snd-ua101.
