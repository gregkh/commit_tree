x86/kprobes: Fix to check non boostable prefixes correctly

There are 2 bugs in the can_boost() function because of using
x86 insn decoder. Since the insn->opcode never has a prefix byte,
it can not find CS override prefix in it. And the insn->attr is
the attribute of the opcode, thus inat_is_address_size_prefix(
insn->attr) always returns false.

Fix those by checking each prefix bytes with for_each_insn_prefix
loop and getting the correct attribute for each prefix byte.
Also, this removes unlikely, because this is a slow path.
