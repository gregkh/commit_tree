media: atomisp: replace boolean comparison of values with bool variables

There are certain expressions in a condition in atomisp, where a boolean
variable is compared with true/false in forms such as (foo == true)
or (false != bar), which does not comply with the coding style rule by
checkpatch.pl (CHK: BOOL_COMPARISON), according to which the boolean
variables should be themselves used in the condition, rather than
comparing with true or false.

E.g. In drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp_compat_css20.c:

if (asd->stream_prepared == false) {

Can be replaced with:
if (!asd->stream_prepared) {

Replace such expressions with boolean variables appropriately.
