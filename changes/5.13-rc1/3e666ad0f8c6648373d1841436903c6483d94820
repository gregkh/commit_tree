coresight: ete: Add support for ETE sysreg access

Add support for handling the system registers for Embedded Trace
Extensions (ETE). ETE shares most of the registers with ETMv4 except
for some and also adds some new registers. Re-arrange the ETMv4x list
to share the common definitions and add the ETE sysreg support.
