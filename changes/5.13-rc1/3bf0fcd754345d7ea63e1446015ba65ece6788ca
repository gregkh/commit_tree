KVM: selftests: Speed up set_memory_region_test

After commit 4fc096a99e01 ("KVM: Raise the maximum number of user memslots")
set_memory_region_test may take too long, reports are that the default
timeout value we have (120s) may not be enough even on a physical host.

Speed things up a bit by throwing away vm_userspace_mem_region_add() usage
from test_add_max_memory_regions(), we don't really need to do the majority
of the stuff it does for the sake of this test.

On my AMD EPYC 7401P, # time ./set_memory_region_test
pre-patch:
 Testing KVM_RUN with zero added memory regions
 Allowed number of memory slots: 32764
 Adding slots 0..32763, each memory region with 2048K size
 Testing MOVE of in-use region, 10 loops
 Testing DELETE of in-use region, 10 loops

 real	0m44.917s
 user	0m7.416s
 sys	0m34.601s
