net: fix use after free in xps

When setting up an new dev_maps in __netif_set_xps_queue, we remove and
free maps from unused CPUs/rx-queues near the end of the function; by
calling remove_xps_queue. However it's possible those maps are also part
of the old not-freed-yet dev_maps, which might be used concurrently.
When that happens, a map can be freed while its corresponding entry in
the old dev_maps table isn't NULLed, leading to: "BUG: KASAN:
use-after-free" in different places.

This fixes the map freeing logic for unused CPUs/rx-queues, to also NULL
the map entries from the old dev_maps table.
