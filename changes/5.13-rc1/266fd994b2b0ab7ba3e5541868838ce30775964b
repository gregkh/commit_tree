ALSA: hda/realtek: ALC285 Thinkpad jack pin quirk is unreachable

In 9bbb94e57df1 ("ALSA: hda/realtek: fix static noise on ALC285 Lenovo
laptops") an existing Lenovo quirk was made more generic by removing a
0x12 pin requirement from the entry. This made the second chance table
Thinkpad jack entry unreachable as the pin configurations became
identical.

Revert the 0x12 pin requirement removal and move Thinkpad jack pin quirk
back to the primary pin table as they can co-exist when more specific
configurations come first.

Add a more targeted pin quirk for Lenovo devices that have 0x12 as
0x40000000.

Tested on Yoga 6 (AMD) laptop.
