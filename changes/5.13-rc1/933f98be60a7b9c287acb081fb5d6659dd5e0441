ASoC: constify of_phandle_args in snd_soc_get_dai_name()

The pointer to of_phandle_args passed to snd_soc_get_dai_name() and
of_xlate_dai_name() implementations is not modified.  Since it is being
used only to translate passed OF node to a DAI name, it should not be
modified, so mark it as const for correctness and safer code.
