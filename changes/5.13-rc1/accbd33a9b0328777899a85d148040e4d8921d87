selftests/bpf: Test syscall command parsing

Add building of the bpf(2) syscall commands documentation as part of the
docs building step in the build. This allows us to pick up on potential
parse errors from the docs generator script as part of selftests.

The generated manual pages here are not intended for distribution, they
are just a fragment that can be integrated into the other static text of
bpf(2) to form the full manual page.
