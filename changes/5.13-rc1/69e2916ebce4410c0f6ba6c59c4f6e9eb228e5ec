net/mlx5: CT: Add support for mirroring

Add support for mirroring before the CT action by spliting the pre ct rule.
Mirror outputs are done first on the tc chain,prio table rule (the fwd
rule), which will then forward to a per port fwd table.
On this fwd table, we insert the original pre ct rule that forwards to
ct/ct nat table.
