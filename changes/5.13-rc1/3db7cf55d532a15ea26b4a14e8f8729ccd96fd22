block/rnbd-clt-sysfs: Remove copy buffer overlap in rnbd_clt_get_path_name

cppcheck report the following error:
  rnbd/rnbd-clt-sysfs.c:522:36: error: The variable 'buf' is used both
  as a parameter and as destination in snprintf(). The origin and
  destination buffers overlap. Quote from glibc (C-library)
  documentation
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Formatted-Output-Functions):
  "If copying takes place between objects that overlap as a result of a
  call to sprintf() or snprintf(), the results are undefined."
  [sprintfOverlappingData]
Fix it by initializing the buf variable in the first snprintf call.
