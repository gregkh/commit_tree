KVM: x86/mmu: Use leaf-only loop for walking TDP SPTEs when changing SPTE

Use the leaf-only TDP iterator when changing the SPTE in reaction to a
MMU notifier.  Practically speaking, this is a nop since the guts of the
loop explicitly looks for 4k SPTEs, which are always leaf SPTEs.  Switch
the iterator to match age_gfn_range() and test_age_gfn() so that a future
patch can consolidate the core iterating logic.

No real functional change intended.
