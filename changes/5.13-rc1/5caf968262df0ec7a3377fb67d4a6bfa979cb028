mm: add generic function_nocfi macro

With CONFIG_CFI_CLANG, the compiler replaces function addresses
in instrumented C code with jump table addresses. This means that
__pa_symbol(function) returns the physical address of the jump table
entry instead of the actual function, which may not work as the jump
table code will immediately jump to a virtual address that may not be
mapped.

To avoid this address space confusion, this change adds a generic
definition for function_nocfi(), which architectures that support CFI
can override. The typical implementation of would use inline assembly
to take the function address, which avoids compiler instrumentation.
