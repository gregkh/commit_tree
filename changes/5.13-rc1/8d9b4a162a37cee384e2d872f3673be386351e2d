btrfs: exclude mmap from happening during all fallocate operations

There's a small window where a deadlock can happen between fallocate and
mmap.  This is described in detail by Filipe:

"""
When doing a fallocate operation we lock the inode, flush delalloc within
the target range, wait for any ordered extents to complete and then lock
the file range. Before we lock the range and after we flush delalloc,
there is a time window where another task can come in and do a memory
mapped write for a page within the fallocate range.

This means that after fallocate locks the range, there can be a dirty page
in the range. More often than not, this does not cause any problem.
The exception is when we are low on available metadata space, because an
fallocate operation needs to start a transaction while holding the file
range locked, either through btrfs_prealloc_file_range() or through the
call to btrfs_fallocate_update_isize(). If that's the case, we can end up
in a deadlock. The following list of steps explains how that happens:

1) A fallocate operation starts, locks the inode, flushes delalloc in the
   range and waits for ordered extents in the range to complete;

2) Before the fallocate task locks the file range, another task does a
   memory mapped write for a page in the fallocate target range. This is
   possible since memory mapped writes do not (and can not) lock the
   inode;

3) The fallocate task locks the file range. At this point there is one
   dirty page in the range (due to the memory mapped write);

4) When the fallocate task attempts to start a transaction, it blocks when
   attempting to reserve metadata space, since we are low on available
   metadata space. Before blocking (wait on its reservation ticket), it
   starts the async reclaim task (if not running already);

5) The async reclaim task is not able to release space through any other
   means, so it decides to flush delalloc for inodes with dirty pages.
   It finds that the inode used in the fallocate operation has a dirty
   page and therefore queues a job (fs_info->flush_workers workqueue) to
   flush delalloc for that inode and waits on that job to complete;

6) The flush job blocks when attempting to lock the file range because
   it is currently locked by the fallocate task;

7) The fallocate task keeps waiting for its metadata reservation, waiting
   for a wakeup on its reservation ticket. The async reclaim task is
   waiting on the flush job, which in turn is waiting for locking the file
   range that is currently locked by the fallocate task. So unless some
   other task is able to release enough metadata space, for example an
   ordered extent for some other inode completes, we end up in a deadlock
   between all these tasks.

When this happens stack traces like the following show up in dmesg/syslog:

Fix this by disallowing mmaps from happening while we're doing any of
the fallocate operations on this inode.
