drm/amd/pm: Add LightSBR SMU MSG support

This new MSG provide the interface for driver to enable/disable the Light Secondary Bus Reset
support from SMU. When enabled, SMU will only do minimum NBIO response to the SBR request and
leave the real HW reset to be handled by driver later. When disabled (default state),SMU will
pass the request to PSP for a HW reset
