HID: logitech-dj: Use hid-ids.h defines for USB device-ids for all supported devices

The logitech-dj code already uses hid-ids.h defines for almost all devices
it supports. Lets be consistent: add and use hid-ids.h defines for the
G700, MX5000 and MX5500 receivers too.

Also add / update some comments to make the comment style in the
hid_device_id table consistent too.
