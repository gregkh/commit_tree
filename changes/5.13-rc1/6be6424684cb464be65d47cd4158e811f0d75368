drm/amd/pm: Enable performance determinism on aldebaran

Performance Determinism is a new mode in Aldebaran where PMFW tries to
maintain sustained performance level. It can be enabled on a per-die
basis on aldebaran. To guarantee that it remains within the power cap,
a max GFX frequency needs to be specified in this mode. A new
power_dpm_force_performance_level, "perf_determinism", is defined to enable
this mode in amdgpu. The max frequency (in MHz) can be specified through
pp_dpm_sclk. The mode will be disabled once any other performance level
is chosen.

Ex: To enable perf determinism at 900Mhz max gfx clock

echo perf_determinism > /sys/bus/pci/devices/.../power_dpm_force_performance_level
echo max 900 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/.../pp_dpm_sclk
