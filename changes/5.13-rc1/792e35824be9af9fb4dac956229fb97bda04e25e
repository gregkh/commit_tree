io_uring: add IORING_REGISTER_RSRC

Add a new io_uring_register() opcode for rsrc registeration. Instead of
accepting a pointer to resources, fds or iovecs, it @arg is now pointing
to a struct io_uring_rsrc_register, and the second argument tells how
large that struct is to make it easily extendible by adding new fields.

All that is done mainly to be able to pass in a pointer with tags. Pass
it in and enable CQE posting for file resources. Doesn't support setting
tags on update yet.

A design choice made here is to not post CQEs on rsrc de-registration,
but only when we updated-removed it by rsrc dynamic update.
