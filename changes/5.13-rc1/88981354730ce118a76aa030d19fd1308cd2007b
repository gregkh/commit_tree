Bluetooth: btintel: Collect tlv based active firmware build info in FW mode

In Operational firmware mode, 'Minimum FW version' TLV ID is not available.
So, we cannot fetch already running firmware info for comparison against
another build. However, It can be collected using a combination of other
TLV ID's information.
