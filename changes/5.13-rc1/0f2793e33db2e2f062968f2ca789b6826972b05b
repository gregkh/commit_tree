powerpc/32: Perform normal function call in exception entry

Now that the MMU is re-enabled before calling the transfer function,
we don't need anymore that hack with the address of the handler and
the return function sitting just after the 'bl' to the transfer
fonction, that function is retrieving via a read relative to 'lr'.

Do a regular call to the transfer function, then to the handler,
then branch to the return function.
