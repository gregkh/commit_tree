xsk: Fix for xp_aligned_validate_desc() when len == chunk_size

When desc->len is equal to chunk_size, it is legal. But when the
xp_aligned_validate_desc() got chunk_end from desc->addr + desc->len
pointing to the next chunk during the check, it caused the check to
fail.

This problem was first introduced in bbff2f321a86 ("xsk: new descriptor
addressing scheme"). Later in 2b43470add8c ("xsk: Introduce AF_XDP buffer
allocation API") this piece of code was moved into the new function called
xp_aligned_validate_desc(). This function was then moved into xsk_queue.h
via 26062b185eee ("xsk: Explicitly inline functions and move definitions").
