PCI: Allow VPD access for QLogic ISP2722

0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic ISP2722") disabled access
to VPD of the ISP2722-based 16/32Gb Fibre Channel to PCIe Adapter because
reading past the end of the VPD caused NMIs.

104daa71b396 ("PCI: Determine actual VPD size on first access") limits
reads to the actual size of VPD, which should prevent these NMIs.

104daa71b396 was merged *before* 0d5370d1d852, but we think the testing
that prompted 0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic ISP2722")
was done with a kernel that lacked 104daa71b396.  See [1, 2].

Remove the quirk added by 0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic
ISP2722") so customers can read the HBA VPD.
