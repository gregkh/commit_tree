staging: rtl8723bs: remove all DBG_871X logs

Remove all of the DBG_871X logs as they
currently do nothing as they require the code to be modified by
hand in order to be turned on. This obviously has not happened
since the code was merged, so just remove them as they are unused.

applied the following semantic patch script:

@@
expression a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k;
constant B, C, D, E;
