tcp: plug skb_still_in_host_queue() to TSQ

Jakub and Neil reported an increase of RTO timers whenever
TX completions are delayed a bit more (by increasing
NIC TX coalescing parameters)

Main issue is that TCP stack has a logic preventing a packet
being retransmit if the prior clone has not yet been
orphaned or freed.

This logic came with commit 1f3279ae0c13 ("tcp: avoid
retransmits of TCP packets hanging in host queues")

Thankfully, in the case skb_still_in_host_queue() detects
the initial clone is still in flight, it can use TSQ logic
that will eventually retry later, at the moment the clone
is freed or orphaned.
