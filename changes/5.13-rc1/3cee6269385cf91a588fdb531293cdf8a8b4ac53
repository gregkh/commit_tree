drm/i915/intel_fb: Pull FB plane functions from intel_display.c

Move the FB plane specific functions from intel_display.c to intel_fb.c.
There's more functions like this, but I leave moving those as well for a
follow up, and for now moving only the ones needed by the end of this
patchset (adding support for padding tile-rows in an FB GGTT view).
