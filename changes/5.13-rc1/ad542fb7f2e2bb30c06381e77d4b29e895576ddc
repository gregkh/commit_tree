mpls: Remove redundant assignment to err

Variable err is set to -ENOMEM but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

net/mpls/af_mpls.c:1022:2: warning: Value stored to 'err' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
