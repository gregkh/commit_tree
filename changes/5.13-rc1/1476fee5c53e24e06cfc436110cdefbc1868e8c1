kbuild: add a script to remove stale generated files

We maintain .gitignore and Makefiles so build artifacts are properly
ignored by Git, and cleaned up by 'make clean'. However, the code is
always changing; generated files are often moved to another directory,
or removed when they become unnecessary. Such garbage files tend to be
left over in the source tree because people usually git-pull without
cleaning the tree.

This is not only the noise for 'git status', but also a build issue
in some cases.

One solution is to remove a stale file like commit 223c24a7dba9 ("kbuild:
Automatically remove stale <linux/version.h> file") did. Such workaround
should be removed after a while, but we forget about that if we scatter
the workaround code in random places.

So, this commit adds a new script to collect cleanings of stale files.

As a start point, move the code in arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile
into this script.
