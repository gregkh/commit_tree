selftests/bpf: Templatize man page generation

Previously, the Makefile here was only targeting a single manual page so
it just hardcoded a bunch of individual rules to specifically handle
build, clean, install, uninstall for that particular page.

Upcoming commits will generate manual pages for an additional section,
so this commit prepares the makefile first by converting the existing
targets into an evaluated set of targets based on the manual page name
and section.
