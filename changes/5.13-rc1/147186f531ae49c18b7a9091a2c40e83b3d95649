mmc: core: Do a power cycle when the CMD11 fails

A CMD11 is sent to the SD/SDIO card to start the voltage switch procedure
into 1.8V I/O. According to the SD spec a power cycle is needed of the
card, if it turns out that the CMD11 fails. Let's fix this, to allow a
retry of the initialization without the voltage switch, to succeed.

Note that, whether it makes sense to also retry with the voltage switch
after the power cycle is a bit more difficult to know. At this point, we
treat it like the CMD11 isn't supported and therefore we skip it when
retrying.
