mm, kasan: don't poison boot memory with tag-based modes

During boot, all non-reserved memblock memory is exposed to page_alloc via
memblock_free_pages->__free_pages_core().  This results in
kasan_free_pages() being called, which poisons that memory.

Poisoning all that memory lengthens boot time.  The most noticeable effect
is observed with the HW_TAGS mode.  A boot-time impact may potentially
also affect systems with large amount of RAM.

This patch changes the tag-based modes to not poison the memory during the
memblock->page_alloc transition.

An exception is made for KASAN_GENERIC.  Since it marks all new memory as
accessible, not poisoning the memory released from memblock will lead to
KASAN missing invalid boot-time accesses to that memory.

With KASAN_SW_TAGS, as it uses the invalid 0xFE tag as the default tag for
all memory, it won't miss bad boot-time accesses even if the poisoning of
memblock memory is removed.

With KASAN_HW_TAGS, the default memory tags values are unspecified.
Therefore, if memblock poisoning is removed, this KASAN mode will miss the
mentioned type of boot-time bugs with a 1/16 probability.  This is taken
as an acceptable trafe-off.

Internally, the poisoning is removed as follows.  __free_pages_core() is
used when exposing fresh memory during system boot and when onlining
memory during hotplug.  This patch adds a new FPI_SKIP_KASAN_POISON flag
and passes it to __free_pages_ok() through free_pages_prepare() from
__free_pages_core().  If FPI_SKIP_KASAN_POISON is set, kasan_free_pages()
is not called.

All memory allocated normally when the boot is over keeps getting poisoned
as usual.
