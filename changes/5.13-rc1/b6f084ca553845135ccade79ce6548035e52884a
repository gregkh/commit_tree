KVM: VMX: Add ENCLS[EINIT] handler to support SGX Launch Control (LC)

Add a VM-Exit handler to trap-and-execute EINIT when SGX LC is enabled
in the host.  When SGX LC is enabled, the host kernel may rewrite the
hardware values at will, e.g. to launch enclaves with different signers,
thus KVM needs to intercept EINIT to ensure it is executed with the
correct LE hash (even if the guest sees a hardwired hash).

Switching the LE hash MSRs on VM-Enter/VM-Exit is not a viable option as
writing the MSRs is prohibitively expensive, e.g. on SKL hardware each
WRMSR is ~400 cycles.  And because EINIT takes tens of thousands of
cycles to execute, the ~1500 cycle overhead to trap-and-execute EINIT is
unlikely to be noticed by the guest, let alone impact its overall SGX
performance.
