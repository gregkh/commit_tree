KVM: VMX: Add SGX ENCLS[ECREATE] handler to enforce CPUID restrictions

Add an ECREATE handler that will be used to intercept ECREATE for the
purpose of enforcing and enclave's MISCSELECT, ATTRIBUTES and XFRM, i.e.
to allow userspace to restrict SGX features via CPUID.  ECREATE will be
intercepted when any of the aforementioned masks diverges from hardware
in order to enforce the desired CPUID model, i.e. inject #GP if the
guest attempts to set a bit that hasn't been enumerated as allowed-1 in
CPUID.

Note, access to the PROVISIONKEY is not yet supported.
