ice: Limit forced overrides based on FW version

Beyond a specific version of firmware, there is no need to provide
override values to the firmware when setting PHY capabilities.  In this
case, we do not need to indicate whether we're in Strict or Lenient Link
Mode.

In the case of translating capabilities to the configuration structure,
the module compliance enforcement is already correctly set by firmware,
so the extra code block is redundant.
