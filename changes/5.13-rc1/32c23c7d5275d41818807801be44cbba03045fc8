KVM: SVM: Don't manually emulate RDPMC if nrips=0

Remove bizarre code that causes KVM to run RDPMC through the emulator
when nrips is disabled.  Accelerated emulation of RDPMC doesn't rely on
any additional data from the VMCB, and SVM has generic handling for
updating RIP to skip instructions when nrips is disabled.
