tools include: Add an initial math64.h

Add an initial math64.h similar to linux/math64.h with functions
mul_u64_u64_div64() and mul_u64_u32_shr(). This isn't a direct copy of
include/linux/math64.h as that doesn't define mul_u64_u64_div64().

Implementation was written by Peter Zilkstra based on linux/math64.h
and div64.h[1]. The original implementation was not optimal on arm64 as
__int128 division is not optimal with a call out to __udivti3, so I
dropped the __int128 variant of mul_u64_u64_div64().
