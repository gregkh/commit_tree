kbuild: prefix $(srctree)/ to some included Makefiles

VPATH is used in Kbuild to make pattern rules search for prerequisites
in both $(objtree) and $(srctree). Some of *.c, *.S files are not real
sources, but generated by tools such as flex, bison, perl.

In contrast, I doubt the benefit of --include-dir=$(abs_srctree) because
it is always clear which Makefiles are real sources, and which are not.

So, my hope is to add $(srctree)/ prefix to all check-in Makefiles,
then remove --include-dir=$(abs_srctree) flag in the future.

I am touching only some Kbuild core parts for now. Treewide fixes will
be needed to achieve this goal.
