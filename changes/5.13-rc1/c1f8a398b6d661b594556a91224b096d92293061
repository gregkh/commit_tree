smb3: if max_channels set to more than one channel request multichannel

Mounting with "multichannel" is obviously implied if user requested
more than one channel on mount (ie mount parm max_channels>1).
Currently both have to be specified. Fix that so that if max_channels
is greater than 1 on mount, enable multichannel rather than silently
falling back to non-multichannel.
