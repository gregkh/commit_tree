macintosh/windfarm: Make symbol 'pm121_sys_state' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/macintosh/windfarm_pm121.c:436:24: warning:
 symbol 'pm121_sys_state' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of windfarm_pm121.c, so this
commit marks it static.
