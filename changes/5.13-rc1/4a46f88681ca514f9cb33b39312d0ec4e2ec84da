spi: hisi-sfc-v3xx: drop unnecessary ACPI_PTR and related ifendif protection

We use ACPI_PTR() and related ifendif protection for the id table.
This is unnecessary as the struct acpi_device_id is defined in
mod_devicetable.h and doesn't rely on ACPI. The driver doesn't
use any ACPI apis, so it can be compiled in the ACPI=n case
with no warnings.

So remove the ACPI_PTR and related ifendif protection, also
replace the header acpi.h with mod_devicetable.h.
