staging: rtl8723bs: remove DBG_871X log argument

This patch prepares the application of the semantic
patch aimed to remove all DBG_871X logs.

One occurrence of the DBG_871X macro has one
repeated argument, that's not even comma separated
value with the previous one nor a format string
parameter associated.

In normal conditions this worked, for the macro
is usually not expanded (the do nothing behaviour),
but if I try to apply the sempantic patch to remove
all macro occurrences, all macros call after that
abnormal declaration are left untouched (not removed).

Remove all of the DBG_871X logs as they currently
do nothing as they require the code to be modified by
hand in order to be turned on. This obviously has not happened
since the code was merged, so just remove them as they are unused.
