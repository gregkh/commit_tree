KVM: arm64: Make memcache anonymous in pgtable allocator

The current stage2 page-table allocator uses a memcache to get
pre-allocated pages when it needs any. To allow re-using this code at
EL2 which uses a concept of memory pools, make the memcache argument of
kvm_pgtable_stage2_map() anonymous, and let the mm_ops zalloc_page()
callbacks use it the way they need to.
