s390/pci: use mutex not spinlock for zbus list

In a later change we will first collect all PCI functions from the CLP
List PCI functions call, then register them to/creating the relevant
zbus. Then only after we've created our virtual bus structure will we
scan all zbusses iterating over the zbus list. Since scanning is
relatively slow a spinlock is a bad fit for protecting the
loop over the devices on the zbus. Furthermore doing the probing on the
bus we need to use pci_lock_rescan_remove() as devices are added to
the PCI subsystem and that is a mutex which can't be locked nested
inside a spinlock section. Note that the contention of this lock should
be very low either way as zbusses are only added/removed concurrently on
hotplug events.
