iio: __iio_format_value(): Convert to sysfs_emit_at()

sysfs_emit() is preferred over raw s*printf() for sysfs attributes since it
knows about the sysfs buffer specifics and has some built-in sanity checks.

Convert __iio_format_value() and related functions to use this new
interface.

This conversion involves changing the signature of __iio_format_value() so
that it similar to sysfs_emit_at() and takes the buffers start address and
an offset where to write within the buffer.
