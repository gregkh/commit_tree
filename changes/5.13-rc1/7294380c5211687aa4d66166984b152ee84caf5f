enetc: support PTP Sync packet one-step timestamping

This patch is to add support for PTP Sync packet one-step timestamping.
Since ENETC single-step register has to be configured dynamically per
packet for correctionField offeset and UDP checksum update, current
one-step timestamping packet has to be sent only when the last one
completes transmitting on hardware. So, on the TX, this patch handles
one-step timestamping packet as below:

- Trasmit packet immediately if no other one in transfer, or queue to
  skb queue if there is already one in transfer.
  The test_and_set_bit_lock() is used here to lock and check state.
- Start a work when complete transfer on hardware, to release the bit
  lock and to send one skb in skb queue if has.

And the configuration for one-step timestamping on ENETC before
transmitting is,

- Set one-step timestamping flag in extension BD.
- Write 30 bits current timestamp in tstamp field of extension BD.
- Update PTP Sync packet originTimestamp field with current timestamp.
- Configure single-step register for correctionField offeset and UDP
  checksum update.
