drm/i915/tgl+: Make sure TypeC FIA is powered up when initializing it

The TypeC FIA can be powered down if the TC-COLD power state is allowed,
so block the TC-COLD state when initializing the FIA.

Note that this isn't needed on ICL where the FIA is never modular and
which has no generic way to block TC-COLD (except for platforms with a
legacy TypeC port and on those too only via these legacy ports, not via
a DP-alt/TBT port).
