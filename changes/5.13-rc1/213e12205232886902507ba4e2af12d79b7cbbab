PCI: xilinx-nwl: Enable coherent PCIe DMA traffic using CCI

Add support for routing PCIe DMA traffic coherently when
Cache Coherent Interconnect (CCI) is enabled in the system.
The "dma-coherent" property is used to determine if CCI is enabled
or not.
Refer to https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0470/k/preface
for the CCI specification.
