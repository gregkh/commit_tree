powerpc/xive: Modernize XIVE-IPI domain with an 'alloc' handler

Instead of calling irq_create_mapping() to map the IPI for a node,
introduce an 'alloc' handler. This is usually an extension to support
hierarchy irq_domains which is not exactly the case for XIVE-IPI
domain. However, we can now use the irq_domain_alloc_irqs() routine
which allocates the IRQ descriptor on the specified node, even better
for cache performance on multi node machines.
