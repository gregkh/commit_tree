tty: serial: samsung_tty: IRQ rework

* Split out s3c24xx_serial_tx_chars from s3c24xx_serial_tx_irq,
  where only the latter acquires the port lock. This will be necessary
  on platforms which have edge-triggered IRQs, as we need to call
  s3c24xx_serial_tx_chars to kick off transmission from outside IRQ
  context, with the port lock held.

* Rename s3c24xx_serial_rx_chars to s3c24xx_serial_rx_irq for
  consistency with the above. All it does now is call two other
  functions anyway.
