x86/sgx: Do not update sgx_nr_free_pages in sgx_setup_epc_section()

The commit in Fixes: changed the SGX EPC page sanitization to end up in
sgx_free_epc_page() which puts clean and sanitized pages on the free
list.

This was done for the reason that it is best to keep the logic to assign
available-for-use EPC pages to the correct NUMA lists in a single
location.

sgx_nr_free_pages is also incremented by sgx_free_epc_pages() but those
pages which are being added there per EPC section do not belong to the
free list yet because they haven't been sanitized yet - they land on the
dirty list first and the sanitization happens later when ksgxd starts
massaging them.

So remove that addition there and have sgx_free_epc_page() do that
solely.

 [ bp: Sanitize commit message too. ]
