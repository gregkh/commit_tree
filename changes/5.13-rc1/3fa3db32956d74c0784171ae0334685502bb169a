powerpc/align: Convert emulate_spe() to user_access_begin

This patch converts emulate_spe() to using user_access_begin
logic.

Since commit 662bbcb2747c ("mm, sched: Allow uaccess in atomic with
pagefault_disable()"), might_fault() doesn't fire when called from
sections where pagefaults are disabled, which must be the case
when using _inatomic variants of __get_user and __put_user. So
the might_fault() in user_access_begin() is not a problem.

There was a verification of user_mode() together with the access_ok(),
but there is a second verification of user_mode() just after, that
leads to immediate return. The access_ok() is now part of the
user_access_begin which is called after that other user_mode()
verification, so no need to check user_mode() again.
