net: fddi: skfp: smt: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of flexible-array members in
smt_sif_operation structure, instead of one-element arrays. Also, make
use of the struct_size() helper instead of the open-coded version
to calculate the size of the struct-with-flex-array. Additionally, make
use of the typeof operator to properly determine the object type to be
passed to macro smtod().

Also, this helps the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by fixing
the following warnings:
