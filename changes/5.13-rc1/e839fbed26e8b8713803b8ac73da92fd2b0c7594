ALSA: hda/hdmi: fix max DP-MST dev_num for Intel TGL+ platforms

Increase the device select range to 4 on platforms supporting
4 concurrent displays.

This fixes a problem in scenario where total of 4 displays are active,
and 3 of these are audio capable DP receivers and connected to a DP-MST
hub. Due to incorrect range for device select, audio could not be played
to the 3rd monitor in DP-MST hub.
