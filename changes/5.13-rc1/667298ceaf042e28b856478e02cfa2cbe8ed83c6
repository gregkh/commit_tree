scsi: smartpqi: Fix blocks_per_row static checker issue

Dan Carpenter found a possible divide by 0 issue in the smartpqi driver in
functions pci_get_aio_common_raid_map_values() and pqi_calc_aio_r5_or_r6().
The variable rmd->blocks_per_row is used as a divisor and could be 0.

       Using rmd->blocks_per_row as a divisor without checking
       it for 0 first.

Correct these possible divide by 0 conditions by insuring that
rmd->blocks_per_row is not zero before usage.  The check for non-0 was too
late to prevent a divide by 0 condition.  Add in a comment to explain why
the check for non-zero is necessary. If the member is 0, return
PQI_RAID_BYPASS_INELIGIBLE before any division is performed.
