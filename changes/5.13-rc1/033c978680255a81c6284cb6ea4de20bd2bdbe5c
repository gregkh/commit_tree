HID: lenovo: Remove lenovo_led_brightness_get()

The led_classdev already contains a cached value of the last set
brightness, the brightness_get callback is only meant for LED drivers
which can read back the actual / current brightness from the hardware.

Since lenovo_led_brightness_get() just returns the last set value
it does not add any functionality, so we can just remove it.
