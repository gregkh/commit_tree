serial: stm32: fix TX and RX FIFO thresholds

TX and RX FIFO thresholds may be cleared after suspend/resume, depending
on the low power mode.

Those configurations (done in startup) are not effective for UART console,
as:
- the reference manual indicates that FIFOEN bit can only be written when
  the USART is disabled (UE=0)
- a set_termios (where UE is set) is requested firstly for console
  enabling, before the startup.
