inet: use bigger hash table for IP ID generation

In commit 73f156a6e8c1 ("inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count")
I used a very small hash table that could be abused
by patient attackers to reveal sensitive information.

Switch to a dynamic sizing, depending on RAM size.

Typical big hosts will now use 128x more storage (2 MB)
to get a similar increase in security and reduction
of hash collisions.

As a bonus, use of alloc_large_system_hash() spreads
allocated memory among all NUMA nodes.
