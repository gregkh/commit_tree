cpufreq: schedutil: Call sugov_update_next_freq() before check to fast_switch_enabled

Note that sugov_update_next_freq() may return false, that means the
caller sugov_fast_switch() will do nothing except fast switch check.

Similarly, sugov_deferred_update() also has unnecessary operations
of raw_spin_{lock,unlock} in sugov_update_single_freq() for that case.

So, let's call sugov_update_next_freq() before the fast switch check
to avoid unnecessary behaviors above. Accordingly, update interface
definition to sugov_deferred_update() and remove sugov_fast_switch()
since we will call cpufreq_driver_fast_switch() directly instead.
