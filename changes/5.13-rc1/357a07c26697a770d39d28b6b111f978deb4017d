net: phy: intel-xway: enable integrated led functions

The Intel xway phys offer the possibility to deactivate the integrated
LED function and to control the LEDs manually.
If this was set by the bootloader, it must be ensured that the
integrated LED function is enabled for all LEDs when loading the driver.

Before commit 6e2d85ec0559 ("net: phy: Stop with excessive soft reset")
the LEDs were enabled by a soft-reset of the PHY (using
genphy_soft_reset). Initialize the XWAY_MDIO_LED with it's default
value (which is applied during a soft reset) instead of adding back
the soft reset. This brings back the default LED configuration while
still preventing an excessive amount of soft resets.
