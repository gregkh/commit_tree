of: overlay: Remove redundant assignment to ret

Variable ret is set to zero but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/of/overlay.c:1197:2: warning: Value stored to 'ret' is never
read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].

drivers/of/overlay.c:1026:2: warning: Value stored to 'ret' is never
read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
