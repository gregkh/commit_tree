net: hns3: optimize the process of queue reset

Currently, the queue reset process needs to be performed one by
one, which is inefficient. However, the queue reset of the same
function is always performed at the same time. Therefore, according
to the UM, command HCLGE_OPC_CFG_RST_TRIGGER can be used to reset
all queues of the same function at a time, in order to optimize
the queue reset process.
