Bluetooth: Remove unneeded commands for suspend

During suspend, there are a few scan enable and set event filter
commands that don't need to be sent unless there are actual BR/EDR
devices capable of waking the system. Check the HCI_PSCAN bit before
writing scan enable and use a new dev flag, HCI_EVENT_FILTER_CONFIGURED
to control whether to clear the event filter.
