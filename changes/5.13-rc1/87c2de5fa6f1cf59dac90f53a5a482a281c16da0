i2c: iop3xx: Fix coding style issues

Fix 20 checkpatch errors.

Among these errors, 18 of them are incorrect space usage, such as:

  ERROR: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
  #128: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-iop3xx.c:128:
  +               if ( !rc ) rc = -I2C_ERR_BERR

The remaining two errors are trailing statements should be on next line,
such as:

  ERROR: trailing statements should be on next line
  #128: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-iop3xx.c:128:
  +               if ( !rc ) rc = -I2C_ERR_BERR;

No functional changes.
