i2c: cadence: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
return in functions cdns_i2c_master_xfer and cdns_reg_slave.

However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter
even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a
reference leak here.

Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
counter balanced.
