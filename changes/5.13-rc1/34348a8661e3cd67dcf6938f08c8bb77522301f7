HID: lenovo: Check hid_get_drvdata() returns non NULL in lenovo_event()

The HID lenovo probe function only attaches drvdata to one of the
USB interfaces, but lenovo_event() will get called for all USB interfaces
to which hid-lenovo is bound.

This allows a malicious device to fake being a device handled by
hid-lenovo, which generates events for which lenovo_event() has
special handling (and thus dereferences hid_get_drvdata()) on another
interface triggering a NULL pointer exception.

Add a check for hid_get_drvdata() returning NULL, avoiding this
possible NULL pointer exception.
