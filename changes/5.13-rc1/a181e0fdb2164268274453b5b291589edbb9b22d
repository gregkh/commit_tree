random: initialize ChaCha20 constants with correct endianness

On big endian CPUs, the ChaCha20-based CRNG is using the wrong
endianness for the ChaCha20 constants.

This doesn't matter cryptographically, but technically it means it's not
ChaCha20 anymore.  Fix it to always use the standard constants.
