ASoC: audio-graph: cleanup graph_for_each_link()

audio-graph checks DT links 2 times. 1st is for counting DAIs / links
to allocating memory, 2nd is for detecting DAIs.
To detecting DAIs as CPU-dummy -> dummy-Codec order when DPCM case,
it uses  loops 2 times.
Because of this kind of complex background, it needs to use local
varuable for it, and each call-back functions need to care about it.

Now, 1st and 2nd DT link check are using same order,
thus we can share same code. This patch do it.
