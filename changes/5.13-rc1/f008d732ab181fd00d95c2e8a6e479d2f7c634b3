bpf: Add batched ops support for percpu array

Uses the already in-place infrastructure provided by the
'generic_map_*_batch' functions.

No tweak was needed as it transparently handles the percpu variant.

As arrays don't have delete operations, let it return a error to
user space (default behaviour).
