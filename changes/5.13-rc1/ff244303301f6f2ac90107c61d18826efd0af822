kernel: always initialize task->pf_io_worker to NULL

Otherwise io_wq_worker_{running,sleeping}() may dereference an
invalid pointer (in future). Currently all users of create_io_thread()
are fine and get task->pf_io_worker = NULL implicitly from the
wq_manager, which got it either from the userspace thread
of the sq_thread, which explicitly reset it to NULL.

I think it's safer to always reset it in order to avoid future
problems.
