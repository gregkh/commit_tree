iio: core: Use sysfs_emit() (trivial bits)

sysfs_emit() is preferred over raw s*printf() for sysfs attributes since it
knows about the sysfs buffer specifics and has some built-in sanity checks.

This patch converts the places in the iio core that follow the pattern of

   return s*printf(...)

to

   return sysfs_emit(...)
