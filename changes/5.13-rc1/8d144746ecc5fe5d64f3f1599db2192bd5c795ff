arm64: alternative: simplify passing alt_region

In __apply_alternatives() we take a pointer to void which we later
assign to a pointer to struct alt_region. As all callers are passing a
pointer to struct alt_region to begin with, it's simpler and more robust
to take a pointer to struct alt region, so let's do so and avoid the
need for a temporary variable.
