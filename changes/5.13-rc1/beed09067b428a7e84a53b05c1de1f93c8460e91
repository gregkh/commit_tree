KVM: arm64: Trap host SVE accesses when the FPSIMD state is dirty

ZCR_EL2 controls the upper bound for ZCR_EL1, and is set to
a potentially lower limit when the guest uses SVE. In order
to restore the SVE state on the EL1 host, we must first
reset ZCR_EL2 to its original value.

To make it as lazy as possible on the EL1 host side, set
the SVE trapping in place when exiting from the guest.
On the first EL1 access to SVE, ZCR_EL2 will be restored
to its full glory.
