KVM: arm64: Rework SVE host-save/guest-restore

In order to keep the code readable, move the host-save/guest-restore
sequences in their own functions, with the following changes:
- the hypervisor ZCR is now set from C code
- ZCR_EL2 is always used as the EL2 accessor

This results in some minor assembler macro rework.
No functional change intended.
