staging: gasket: remove it from the kernel

As none of the proposed things that need to be changed in the gasket
drivers have ever been done, and there has not been any forward progress
to get this out of staging, it seems totally abandonded so remove the
code entirely so that people do not spend their time doing tiny cleanups
for code that will never get out of staging.

If this code is actually being used, it can be reverted simply and then
cleaned up properly, but as it is abandoned, let's just get rid of it.
