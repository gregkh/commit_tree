iio: Documentation: update definitions for bufferY and scan_elements

Since the new change to the IIO buffer infrastructure, the buffer/ and
scan_elements/ directories have been merged into bufferY/ to have some
attributes available per-buffer.

This change updates the ABI docs to reflect this change.

The hwfifo attributes are not updated, as for now these should be used
via the legacy buffer/ directory until they are moved into core.
