f2fs: fix to allow migrating fully valid segment

F2FS_IOC_FLUSH_DEVICE/F2FS_IOC_RESIZE_FS needs to migrate all blocks of
target segment to other place, no matter the segment has partially or fully
valid blocks.

However, after commit 803e74be04b3 ("f2fs: stop GC when the victim becomes
fully valid"), we may skip migration due to target segment is fully valid,
result in failing the ioctl interface, fix this.

Fixes: 803e74be04b3 ("f2fs: stop GC when the victim becomes fully valid")
