Revert "net/sctp: fix race condition in sctp_destroy_sock"

This reverts commit b166a20b07382b8bc1dcee2a448715c9c2c81b5b.

This one has to be reverted as it introduced a dead lock, as
syzbot reported:

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock);
                               lock(slock-AF_INET6);
                               lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock);
  lock(slock-AF_INET6);

CPU0 is the thread of sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler(), and CPU1
is that of sctp_close().

The original issue this commit fixed will be fixed in the next
patch.
