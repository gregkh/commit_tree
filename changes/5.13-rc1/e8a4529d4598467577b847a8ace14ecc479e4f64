crypto: sa2ul - Support for per channel coherency

On AM64 the DMA channel for sa2ul can be configured to be coherent or
non coherent via DT binding.

Use the dmaengine_get_device_for_dma_api() to get the device pointer which
should be used for with the dma_api to use matching dma_ops for the
channel coherency/non coherency.
