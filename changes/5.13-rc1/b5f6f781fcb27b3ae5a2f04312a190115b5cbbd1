ASoC: tegra30: i2s: Remove handing of disabled runtime PM

Runtime PM is always available on Tegra since commit 40b2bb1b132a
("ARM: tegra: enforce PM requirement"), hence there is no need to
handle the case of a disabled RPM by Tegra drivers. Remove handing
of a disabled runtime PM from Tegra30 I2S driver.
