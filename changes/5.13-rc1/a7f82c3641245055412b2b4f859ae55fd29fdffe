s390/pci: rename zpci_configure_device()

With zpci_configure_device() now always called on a device that has
already been configured on the platform level its name has become
misleading. Rename it to zpci_scan_configured_device() to signify that
the function now only handles the correct scanning of a newly configured
PCI function taking care of the special handling necessary for function
0 and functions parked waiting for a PCI bus that can't be created
without first seeing function 0.
