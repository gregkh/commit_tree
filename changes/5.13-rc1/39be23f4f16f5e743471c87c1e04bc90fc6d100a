usb: cdns3: trace: delete the trace parameter for request->trb

It is not correct using %pa to print virtual address of request->trb, and
it is hard to print its physical address due to the virtual address is
zero before using. It could use index (start_trb/end_trb) to know the
current trb position, so no matter virtual address or physical address
for request-trb is not so meaningful.
