xfs: introduce in-core global counter of allocbt blocks

Introduce an in-core counter to track the sum of all allocbt blocks
used by the filesystem. This value is currently tracked per-ag via
the ->agf_btreeblks field in the AGF, which also happens to include
rmapbt blocks. A global, in-core count of allocbt blocks is required
to identify the subset of global ->m_fdblocks that consists of
unavailable blocks currently used for allocation btrees. To support
this calculation at block reservation time, construct a similar
global counter for allocbt blocks, populate it on first read of each
AGF and update it as allocbt blocks are used and released.
