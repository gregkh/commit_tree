crypto: vmx - fix incorrect kernel-doc comment syntax in files

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
There are certain files in drivers/crypto/vmx, which follow this syntax,
but the content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.
Such lines were probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but are parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warnings from kernel-doc.

E.g., presence of kernel-doc like comment in the header line for
drivers/crypto/vmx/vmx.c causes this warning by kernel-doc:

"warning: expecting prototype for Routines supporting VMX instructions on the Power 8(). Prototype was for p8_init() instead"

Similarly for other files too.

Provide a simple fix by replacing such occurrences with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
