net: make xps_needed and xps_rxqs_needed static

Since their introduction in commit 04157469b7b8 ("net: Use static_key
for XPS maps"), xps_needed and xps_rxqs_needed were never used outside
net/core/dev.c, so I don't really understand why they were exported as
symbols in the first place.

This is needed in order to silence a "make W=1" warning about these
static keys not being declared as static variables, but not having a
previous declaration in a header file nonetheless.
