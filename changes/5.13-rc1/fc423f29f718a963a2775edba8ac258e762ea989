pwm: bcm-kona: Use pwmchip_add() instead of pwmchip_add_with_polarity()

The only side effect of this change is that pwm->state.polarity is
initialized to PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL instead of PWM_POLARITY_INVERSED.
However all other members of pwm->state are uninitialized and consumers
are expected to provide the right polarity (either by setting it explicitly
or by using a helper like pwm_init_state() that overwrites .polarity
anyhow with a value independent of the initial value).

The eventual goal is to remove pwmchip_add_with_polarity() and so simplify
the data flow in the PWM core.
