drm/i915: Lock ww in ucode objects correctly

In the ucode functions, the calls are done before userspace runs,
when debugging using debugfs, or when creating semi-permanent mappings;
we can safely use the unlocked versions that does the ww dance for us.

Because there is no pin_pages_unlocked yet, add it as convenience function.

This removes possible lockdep splats about missing resv lock for ucode.
