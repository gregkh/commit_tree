ath10k: skip the wait for completion to recovery in shutdown path

Currently in the shutdown callback we wait for recovery to complete
before freeing up the resources. This results in additional two seconds
delay during the shutdown and thereby increase the shutdown time.

As an attempt to take less time during shutdown, remove the wait for
recovery completion in the shutdown callback and added an API to freeing
the reosurces in which they were common for shutdown and removing
the module.
