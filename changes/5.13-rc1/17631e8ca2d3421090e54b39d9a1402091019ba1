i2c: designware: Add driver support for AMD NAVI GPU

The Latest AMD NAVI GPU card has an integrated Type-C controller and
Designware I2C with PCI Interface. The PD controller for USB Type-C can
be accessed over I2C. The client driver is part of the USB Type-C UCSI
driver.

Also, there exists a couple of notable IP limitations that are dealt as
workarounds:
- I2C transaction work on a polling mode as IP does not generate
interrupt.
- I2C read command sent twice to address the IP issues.
- AMD NAVI GPU based products are already in the commercial market,
  hence some of the I2C parameters are statically programmed as they
  can not be part of the ACPI table.
