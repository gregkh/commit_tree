mm: cma: support sysfs

Since CMA is getting used more widely, it's more important to keep
monitoring CMA statistics for system health since it's directly related to
user experience.

This patch introduces sysfs statistics for CMA, in order to provide some
basic monitoring of the CMA allocator.

 * the number of CMA page successful allocations
 * the number of CMA page allocation failures

These two values allow the user to calcuate the allocation
failure rate for each CMA area.

e.g.)
  /sys/kernel/mm/cma/WIFI/alloc_pages_[success|fail]
  /sys/kernel/mm/cma/SENSOR/alloc_pages_[success|fail]
  /sys/kernel/mm/cma/BLUETOOTH/alloc_pages_[success|fail]

The cma_stat was intentionally allocated by dynamic allocation
to harmonize with kobject lifetime management.
