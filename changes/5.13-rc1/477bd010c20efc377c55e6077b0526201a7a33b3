iio: dac: ad5686: Add support for AD5673R/AD5677R

The AD5673R/AD5677R are low power, 16-channel, 12-/16-bit buffered voltage
output digital-to-analog converters (DACs). They include a 2.5 V internal
reference (enabled by default).

These devices are very similar to AD5674R/AD5679R, except that they
have an i2c interface.
