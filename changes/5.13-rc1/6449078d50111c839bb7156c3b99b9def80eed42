powerpc: Make probe_kernel_read_inst() common to PPC32 and PPC64

We have two independant versions of probe_kernel_read_inst(), one for
PPC32 and one for PPC64.

The PPC32 is identical to the first part of the PPC64 version.
The remaining part of PPC64 version is not relevant for PPC32, but
not contradictory, so we can easily have a common function with
the PPC64 part opted out via a IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PPC64).

The only need is to add a version of ppc_inst_prefix() for PPC32.
