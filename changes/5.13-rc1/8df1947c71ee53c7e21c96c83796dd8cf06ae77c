livepatch: Replace the fake signal sending with TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL infrastructure

Livepatch sends a fake signal to all remaining blocking tasks of a
running transition after a set period of time. It uses TIF_SIGPENDING
flag for the purpose. Commit 12db8b690010 ("entry: Add support for
TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL") added a generic infrastructure to achieve the same.
Replace our bespoke solution with the generic one.
