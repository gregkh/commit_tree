powerpc: Remove probe_user_read_inst()

Its name comes from former probe_user_read() function.
That function is now called copy_from_user_nofault().

probe_user_read_inst() uses copy_from_user_nofault() to read only
a few bytes. It is suboptimal.

It does the same as get_user_inst() but in addition disables
page faults.

But on the other hand, it is not used for the time being. So remove it
for now. If one day it is really needed, we can give it a new name
more in line with today's naming, and implement it using get_user_inst()
