ASoC: soc-compress: lock pcm_mutex to resolve lockdep error

If panic_on_warn=1 is added in bootargs and compress offload playback with
DPCM is started, kernel panic would be occurred because rtd->card->pcm_mutex
isn't held in soc_compr_open_fe() and soc_compr_free_fe() and it generates
lockdep warning in the following code.

void snd_soc_runtime_action(struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *rtd,
			    int stream, int action)
{
	struct snd_soc_dai *dai;
	int i;

	lockdep_assert_held(&rtd->card->pcm_mutex);

To prevent lockdep warning but minimize side effect by adding mutex,
pcm_mutex is held just before snd_soc_runtime_activate() and
snd_soc_runtime_deactivate() and is released right after them.
