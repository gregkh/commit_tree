xprtrdma: Move fr_cid to struct rpcrdma_mr

Clean up (for several purposes):

- The MR's cid is initialized sooner so that tracepoints can show
  something reasonable even if the MR is never posted.
- The MR's res.id doesn't change so the cid won't change either.
  Initializing the cid once is sufficient.
- struct rpcrdma_frwr is going away soon.
