usb: typec: tcpm: Address incorrect values of tcpm psy for fixed supply

tcpm_pd_build_request overwrites current_limit and supply_voltage
even before port partner accepts the requests. This leaves stale
values in current_limit and supply_voltage that get exported by
"tcpm-source-psy-". Solving this problem by caching the request
values of current limit/supply voltage in req_current_limit
and req_supply_voltage. current_limit/supply_voltage gets updated
once the port partner accepts the request.
