powerpc/pseries: Add shutdown() to vio_driver and vio_bus

Currently, neither the vio_bus or vio_driver structures provide support
for a shutdown() routine.

Add support for shutdown() by allowing drivers to provide a
implementation via function pointer in their vio_driver struct and
provide a proper implementation in the driver template for the vio_bus
that calls a vio drivers shutdown() if defined.

In the case that no shutdown() is defined by a vio driver and a kexec is
in progress we implement a big hammer that calls remove() to ensure no
further DMA for the devices is possible.
