udp: Implement ->read_sock() for sockmap

This is similar to tcp_read_sock(), except we do not need
to worry about connections, we just need to retrieve skb
from UDP receive queue.

Note, the return value of ->read_sock() is unused in
sk_psock_verdict_data_ready(), and UDP still does not
support splice() due to lack of ->splice_read(), so users
can not reach udp_read_sock() directly.
