io_uring: encapsulate rsrc node manipulations

io_rsrc_node_get() and io_rsrc_node_set() are always used together,
merge them into one so most users don't even see io_rsrc_node and don't
need to care about it.

It helped to catch io_sqe_files_register() inferring rsrc data argument
for get and set differently, not a problem but a good sign.
