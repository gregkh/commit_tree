usb: ehci: add spurious flag to disable overcurrent checking

This patch adds an ignore_oc flag which can be set by EHCI controller
not supporting or wanting to disable overcurrent checking. The EHCI
platform data in include/linux/usb/ehci_pdriver.h is also augmented to
take advantage of this new flag.
