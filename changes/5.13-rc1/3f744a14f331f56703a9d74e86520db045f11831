scsi: pm80xx: Increase timeout for pm80xx mpi_uninit_check()

The mpi_uninit_check() takes longer for inbound doorbell register to be
cleared. Increase the timeout substantially so that the driver does not
fail to load.

Previously, the inbound doorbell wait time was mistakenly increased in the
mpi_init_check() instead of mpi_uninit_check(). It is okay to leave the
mpi_init_check() wait time as-is as these are timeout values and if there
is a failure, waiting longer is not an issue.
