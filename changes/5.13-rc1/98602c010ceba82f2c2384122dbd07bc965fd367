tty: create internal tty.h file

There are a number of functions and #defines in include/linux/tty.h that
do not belong there as they are private to the tty core code.

Create an initial drivers/tty/tty.h file and copy the odd "tty logging"
macros into it to seed the file with some initial things that we know
nothing outside of the tty core should be calling.
