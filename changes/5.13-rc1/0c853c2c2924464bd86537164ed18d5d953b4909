vdpa: add vdpa simulator for block device

This will allow running vDPA for virtio block protocol.

It's a preliminary implementation with a simple request handling:
for each request, only the status (last byte) is set.
It's always set to VIRTIO_BLK_S_OK.

Also input validation is missing and will be added in the next commits.
