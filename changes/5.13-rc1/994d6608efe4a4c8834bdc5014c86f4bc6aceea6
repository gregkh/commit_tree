iommu/amd: Remove performance counter pre-initialization test

In early AMD desktop/mobile platforms (during 2013), when the IOMMU
Performance Counter (PMC) support was first introduced in
commit 30861ddc9cca ("perf/x86/amd: Add IOMMU Performance Counter
resource management"), there was a HW bug where the counters could not
be accessed. The result was reading of the counter always return zero.

At the time, the suggested workaround was to add a test logic prior
to initializing the PMC feature to check if the counters can be programmed
and read back the same value. This has been working fine until the more
recent desktop/mobile platforms start enabling power gating for the PMC,
which prevents access to the counters. This results in the PMC support
being disabled unnecesarily.

Unfortunatly, there is no documentation of since which generation
of hardware the original PMC HW bug was fixed. Although, it was fixed
soon after the first introduction of the PMC. Base on this, we assume
that the buggy platforms are less likely to be in used, and it should
be relatively safe to remove this legacy logic.
