tty: cyclades, remove this orphan

The Cyclades driver was orphaned by commit d459883e6c54 (MAINTAINERS:
remove two dead e-mail) 13 years ago. Noone stepped up to take care of
them and to fix all the issues the driver has.

On the top of that, there is no way to obtain the firmware for Z cards
from the vendor as cyclades.com ceased to exist.

So it's time to drop the driver with all its traces.
