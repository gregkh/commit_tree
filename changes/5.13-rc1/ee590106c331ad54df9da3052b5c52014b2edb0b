dt-bindings: mtd: Add a property to declare secure regions in NAND chips

On a typical end product, a vendor may choose to secure some regions in
the NAND memory which are supposed to stay intact between FW upgrades.
The access to those regions will be blocked by a secure element like
Trustzone. So the normal world software like Linux kernel should not
touch these regions (including reading).

So let's add a property for declaring such secure regions so that the
drivers can skip touching them.
