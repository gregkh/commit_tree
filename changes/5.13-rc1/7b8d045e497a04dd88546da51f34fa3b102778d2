iio: adc: ad7124: allow more than 8 channels

Currently AD7124-8 driver cannot use more than 8 IIO channels
because it was assigning the channel configurations bijectively
to channels specified in the device-tree. This is not possible
to do when using more than 8 channels as AD7124-8 has only 8
configuration registers.

To allow the user to use all channels at once the driver
will keep in memory configurations for all channels but
will program only 8 of them at a time on the device.
If multiple channels have the same configuration, only
one configuration register will be used. If there
are more configurations than available registers only
the last 8 used configurations will be allowed to exist
on the device in a LRU fashion.
