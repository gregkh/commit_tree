drm/panfrost: Add governor data with pre-defined thresholds

The simple_ondemand devfreq governor uses two thresholds to decide about
the frequency change: upthreshold, downdifferential. These two tunable
change the behavior of the governor decision, e.g. how fast to increase
the frequency or how rapidly limit the frequency. This patch adds needed
governor data with thresholds values gathered experimentally in different
workloads.
