KVM: arm64: Add kvm_pgtable_stage2_find_range()

Since the host stage 2 will be identity mapped, and since it will own
most of memory, it would preferable for performance to try and use large
block mappings whenever that is possible. To ease this, introduce a new
helper in the KVM page-table code which allows to search for large
ranges of available IPA space. This will be used in the host memory
abort path to greedily idmap large portion of the PA space.
