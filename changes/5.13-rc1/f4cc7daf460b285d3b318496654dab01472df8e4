arm64: dts: ti: k3-j7200-common-proc-board: Disable unused gpio modules

There are 6 gpio instances inside SoC with 2 groups as show below:
    Group one: wkup_gpio0, wkup_gpio1
    Group two: main_gpio0, main_gpio2, main_gpio4, main_gpio6

Only one instance from each group can be used at a time. So use main_gpio0
and wkup_gpio0 in current linux context and disable the rest of the nodes.
