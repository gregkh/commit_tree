usbnet: add _mii suffix to usbnet_set/get_link_ksettings

The generic functions assumed devices provided an MDIO interface (accessed
via older mii code, not phylib). This is true only for genuine ethernet.

Devices with a higher level of abstraction or based on different
technologies do not have MDIO. To support this case, first rename
the existing functions with _mii suffix.

v2: rebased on changed upstream
v3: changed names to clearly say that this does NOT use phylib
v4: moved hunks to correct patch; reworded commmit messages
