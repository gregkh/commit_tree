ASoC: SOF: Intel: HDA: add hw params callback for SSP DAIs

Currently SSP DAIs don't have hw params callback function as there
wasn't anything to setup after initial topology loading. After enabling
multiple DAI configs the current config can be sent in the callback.

This patch changes the way SSP config ipc is sent to the dsp. Before it
was only sent once in topology loading, but now it will be additionally
sent always when stream is opened. Mechanism is similar as with HDA
DAIs.
