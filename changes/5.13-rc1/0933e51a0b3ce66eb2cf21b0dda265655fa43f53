staging: rtl8188eu: Fix null pointer dereference on free_netdev call

An unregister_netdev call checks if pnetdev is null, hence a later
call to free_netdev can potentially be passing a null pointer, causing
a null pointer dereference. Avoid this by adding a null pointer check
on pnetdev before calling free_netdev.
