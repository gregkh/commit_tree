arm64: entry: remove test_irqs_unmasked macro

We haven't needed the test_irqs_unmasked macro since commit:

  105fc3352077bba5 ("arm64: entry: move el1 irq/nmi logic to C")

... and as we convert more of the entry logic to C it is decreasingly
likely we'll need it in future, so let's remove the unused macro.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
