KVM: x86/mmu: Move logic for setting SPTE masks for EPT into the MMU proper

Let the MMU deal with the SPTE masks to avoid splitting the logic and
knowledge across the MMU and VMX.

The SPTE masks that are used for EPT are very, very tightly coupled to
the MMU implementation.  The use of available bits, the existence of A/D
types, the fact that shadow_x_mask even exists, and so on and so forth
are all baked into the MMU implementation.  Cross referencing the params
to the masks is also a nightmare, as pretty much every param is a u64.

A future patch will make the location of the MMU_WRITABLE and
HOST_WRITABLE bits MMU specific, to free up bit 11 for a MMU_PRESENT bit.
Doing that change with the current kvm_mmu_set_mask_ptes() would be an
absolute mess.

No functional change intended.
