s390/pci: refactor zpci function states

The current zdev->state mixes the configuration states supported by CLP
with an additional Online state which is used inconsistently to include
enabled zPCI functions which are not yet visible to the common PCI
subsytem. In preparation for a clean separation between architected
configuration states and fine grained function states remove the Online
function state.

Where we previously checked for Online it is more accurate to check if
the function is enabled to avoid an edge case where a disabled device
was still treated as Online. This also simplifies checks whether
a function is configured as this is now directly reflected by its
function state.
