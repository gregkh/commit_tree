firmware: google: Enable s0ix logging by default

Many moons ago, support was added to the SMI handlers to log s0ix entry
and exit. Early iterations of firmware on Apollo Lake correctly returned
"unsupported" for this new command they did not recognize, but
unfortunately also contained a quirk where this command would cause them
to power down rather than resume from s0ix.

Fixes for this quirk were pushed out long ago, so all APL devices still
in the field should have updated firmware. As such, we no longer need to
have the s0ix_logging_enable be opt-in, where every new platform has to
add this to their kernel commandline parameters. Change it to be on by
default.

In theory we could remove the parameter altogether: updated versions of
Chrome OS containing a kernel with this change would also be coupled
with firmware that behaves properly with these commands. Eventually we
should probably do that. For now, convert this to an opt-out parameter
so there's an emergency valve for people who are deliberately running
old firmware, or as an escape hatch in case of unforeseen regressions.
