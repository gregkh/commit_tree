KVM: x86/mmu: Allocate the lm_root before allocating PAE roots

Allocate lm_root before the PAE roots so that the PAE roots aren't
leaked if the memory allocation for the lm_root happens to fail.

Note, KVM can still leak PAE roots if mmu_check_root() fails on a guest's
PDPTR, or if mmu_alloc_root() fails due to MMU pages not being available.
Those issues will be fixed in future commits.
