ARM: 9061/1: kprobes: fix UNPREDICTABLE warnings

GNU as warns twice for this file:
Warning: using r15 results in unpredictable behaviour

via the Arm ARM:
K1.1.1 Overview of the constraints on Armv7 UNPREDICTABLE behaviors

  The term UNPREDICTABLE describes a number of cases where the
  architecture has a feature that software must not use.

Ard notes:
  These are selftests that aim to ensure that kprobe never attempts to
  replace the opcodes in question with a probe, but they are not
  actually executed, or expected to occur in real code.
