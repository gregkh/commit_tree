Documentation: networking: dsa: rewrite chapter about tagging protocol

The chapter about tagging protocols is out of date because it doesn't
mention all taggers that have been added since last documentation
update. But judging based on that, it will always tend to lag behind,
and there's no good reason why we would enumerate the supported
hardware. Instead we could do something more useful and explain what
there is to know about tagging protocols instead.
