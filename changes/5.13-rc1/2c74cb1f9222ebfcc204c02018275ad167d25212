scsi: hisi_sas: Directly snapshot registers when executing a reset

The debugfs snapshot should be executed before the reset occurs to ensure
that the register contents are saved properly.

As such, it is incorrect to queue the debugfs dump when running a reset as
the reset will occur prior to the snapshot work item is handler.

Therefore, directly snapshot registers in the reset work handler.
