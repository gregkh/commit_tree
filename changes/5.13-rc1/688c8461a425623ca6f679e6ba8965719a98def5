ASoC: arizona-jack: Use arizona->dev for runtime-pm

Drivers for MFD child-devices such as the arizona codec drivers
and the arizona-extcon driver can choose to either make
runtime_pm_get/_put calls on their own child-device, which will
then be propagated to their parent; or they can make them directly
on their MFD parent-device.

The arizona-extcon code was using runtime_pm_get/_put calls on
its own child-device where as the codec drivers are using
runtime_pm_get/_put calls on their parent.

The arizona-extcon MFD cell/child-device has been removed and this
commit is part of refactoring the arizona-extcon code into a library
to be used directly from the codec drivers.

Specifically this commit moves the code over to make
runtime_pm_get/_put calls on the parent device (on arizona->dev)
bringing the code inline with how the codec drivers do this.

Note this also removes the pm_runtime_enable/_disable calls
as pm_runtime support has already been enabled on the parent-device
by the arizona MFD driver.

This is part of a patch series converting the arizona extcon driver into
a helper library for letting the arizona codec-drivers directly report
jack state through the standard sound/soc/soc-jack.c functions.
