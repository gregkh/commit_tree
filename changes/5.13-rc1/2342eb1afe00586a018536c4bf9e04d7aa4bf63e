llc2: Remove redundant assignment to rc

Variable rc is set to zero but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

net/llc/llc_station.c:86:2: warning: Value stored to 'rc' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
