xfs: update superblock counters correctly for !lazysbcount

Keep the mount superblock counters up to date for !lazysbcount
filesystems so that when we log the superblock they do not need
updating in any way because they are already correct.

It's found by what Zorro reported:
1. mkfs.xfs -f -l lazy-count=0 -m crc=0 $dev
2. mount $dev $mnt
3. fsstress -d $mnt -p 100 -n 1000 (maybe need more or less io load)
4. umount $mnt
5. xfs_repair -n $dev
and I've seen no problem with this patch.
