tty: fix return value for unsupported termiox ioctls

Drivers should return -ENOTTY ("Inappropriate I/O control operation")
when an ioctl isn't supported, while -EINVAL is used for invalid
arguments.

Support for termiox was added by commit 1d65b4a088de ("tty: Add
termiox") in 2008 but no driver support ever followed and it was
recently ripped out by commit e0efb3168d34 ("tty: Remove dead termiox
code").

Fix the return value for the unsupported termiox ioctls, which have
always returned -EINVAL, by explicitly returning -ENOTTY rather than
removing them completely and falling back to the default unrecognised-
ioctl handling.
