spi: omap-100k: Fix reference leak to master

Call spi_master_get() holds the reference count to master device, thus
we need an additional spi_master_put() call to reduce the reference
count, otherwise we will leak a reference to master.

This commit fix it by removing the unnecessary spi_master_get().
