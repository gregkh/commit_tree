ktest: Add example config for using VMware VMs

This duplicates the KVM/Qemu config with specific notes for how
to use it with VMware VMs on Workstation, Player, or Fusion.
The main thing to be aware of is how the serial port is exposed
which is a unix pipe, and will need something like ncat to get
into ktest's monitoring
