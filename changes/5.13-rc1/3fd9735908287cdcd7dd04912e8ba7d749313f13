f2fs: fix error path of f2fs_remount()

In error path of f2fs_remount(), it missed to restart/stop kernel thread
or enable/disable checkpoint, then mount option status may not be
consistent with real condition of filesystem, so let's reorder remount
flow a bit as below and do recovery correctly in error path:

1) handle gc thread
2) handle ckpt thread
3) handle flush thread
4) handle checkpoint disabling
