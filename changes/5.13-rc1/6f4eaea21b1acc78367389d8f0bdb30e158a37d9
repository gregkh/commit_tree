media: cobalt: fix initial EDID

The EDID failed with two edid-decode warnings:

Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  Video Data Block: VIC 16 is the preferred timing, overriding the first detailed timings. Is this intended?
  Video Capability Data Block: S_PT is equal to S_IT and S_CE, so should be set to 0 instead.

In addition, the first DTD had a wrong vsync value (6 instead of 5).
