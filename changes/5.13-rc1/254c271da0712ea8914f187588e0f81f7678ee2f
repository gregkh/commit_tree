md/raid10: improve discard request for far layout

For far layout, the discard region is not continuous on disks. So it needs
far copies r10bio to cover all regions. It needs a way to know all r10bios
have finish or not. Similar with raid10_sync_request, only the first r10bio
master_bio records the discard bio. Other r10bios master_bio record the
first r10bio. The first r10bio can finish after other r10bios finish and
then return the discard bio.
