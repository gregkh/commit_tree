kselftest: introduce new epoll test case

Patch series "fs/epoll: restore user-visible behavior upon event ready".

This series tries to address a change in user visible behavior, reported
in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208943.

Epoll does not report an event to all the threads running epoll_wait()
on the same epoll descriptor. Unsurprisingly, this was bisected back to
339ddb53d373 (fs/epoll: remove unnecessary wakeups of nested epoll), which
has had various problems in the past, beyond only nested epoll usage.

This patch (of 2):

This incorporates the testcase originally reported in:

     https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208943

Which ensures an event is reported to all threads blocked on the same
epoll descriptor, otherwise only a single thread will receive the wakeup
once the event become ready.
