ALSA: hda/cirrus: Add jack detect interrupt support from CS42L42 companion codec.

In the case of CS8409 we do not have unsol events from NID's 0x24 and 0x34
where hs mic and hp are connected. Companion codec CS42L42 will generate
interrupt via gpio 4 to notify jack events. We have to overwrite standard
snd_hda_jack_unsol_event(), read CS42L42 jack detect status registers and
then notify status via generic snd_hda_jack_unsol_event() call.

Tested on DELL Inspiron-3500, DELL Inspiron-3501, DELL Inspiron-3505.
