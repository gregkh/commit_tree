mt76: mt7615: keep mcu_add_bss_info enabled till interface removal

BSS_INFO_BASIC is never called alone with inactive state, which always
follows beacon offload disable, so keep it enabled throughout interfaces
life cycle. Inactive state also removes sta record of all connected
stations, thurs causes connection lost which defeats the purpose of CSA.

Lastly, this is especially an unexpected behavior that keeping mt7622
failing beacon buffer recyled when scanning channels.

bss_conf change is updated with active state only, so just overwrite it.
