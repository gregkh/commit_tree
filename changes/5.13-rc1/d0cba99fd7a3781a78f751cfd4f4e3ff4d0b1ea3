scsi: smartpqi: Update enclosure identifier in sysfs

Update enclosure identifier field corresponding to physical devices in
lsscsi/sysfs.

During device add the SCSI devtype is filled in during slave_configure().
However, when pqi_scsi_update_device() runs (REGNEWD) the firmware returns
zero for the SCSI devtype field, and valid devtype is overwritten by
zero. Due to this, lsscsi output shows wrong values.
