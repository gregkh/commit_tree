drm/syncobj: use newly allocated stub fences

Allocate a new private stub fence in drm_syncobj_assign_null_handle,
instead of using a static stub fence.

When userspace creates a fence with DRM_SYNCOBJ_CREATE_SIGNALED or when
userspace signals a fence via DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_SIGNAL, the timestamp
obtained when the fence is exported and queried with SYNC_IOC_FILE_INFO
should match when the fence's status was changed from the perspective of
userspace, which is during the respective ioctl.

When a static stub fence started being used in by these ioctls, this
behavior changed. Instead, the timestamp returned by SYNC_IOC_FILE_INFO
became the first time anything used the static stub fence, which has no
meaning to userspace.
