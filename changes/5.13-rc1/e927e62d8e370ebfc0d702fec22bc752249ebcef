x86/boot/compressed/64: Add CPUID sanity check to 32-bit boot-path

The 32-bit #VC handler has no GHCB and can only handle CPUID exit codes.
It is needed by the early boot code to handle #VC exceptions raised in
verify_cpu() and to get the position of the C-bit.

But the CPUID information comes from the hypervisor which is untrusted
and might return results which trick the guest into the no-SEV boot path
with no C-bit set in the page-tables. All data written to memory would
then be unencrypted and could leak sensitive data to the hypervisor.

Add sanity checks to the 32-bit boot #VC handler to make sure the
hypervisor does not pretend that SEV is not enabled.
