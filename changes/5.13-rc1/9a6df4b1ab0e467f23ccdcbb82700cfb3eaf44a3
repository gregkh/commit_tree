iio: documentation: Document accelerometer label use

Some 2-in-1 laptops / convertibles with 360Â° (yoga-style) hinges,
have 2 accelerometers, 1 in their base and 1 in their display.

In many cases the kernel can detect the location of each accelerometer
based on e.g. information from the ACPI tables.

It is important for userspace to know the location of the 2 accelerometers.
Rather then adding a new sysfs-attribute for this we can relay this
information to userspace by using standardized label strings for this.
This mirrors how this is done for proximity sensors.

This commit documents 2 new standardized label strings for this purpose:
"accel-base"
"accel-display"

Note the "base" and "display" suffixes were chosen to match the values
used for the systemd/udev hwdb.d/60-sensor.hwdb file's ACCEL_LOCATION
property.
