clk: qcom: a53-pll: Add missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE

CONFIG_QCOM_A53PLL is tristate option and therefore this driver can be
compiled as a module. This patch adds missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
definition which generates correct modalias for automatic loading of
this driver when it is built as an external module.
