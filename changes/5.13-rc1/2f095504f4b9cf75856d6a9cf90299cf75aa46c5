scripts/recordmcount.pl: Fix RISC-V regex for clang

Clang can generate R_RISCV_CALL_PLT relocations to _mcount:

$ llvm-objdump -dr build/riscv/init/main.o | rg mcount
                000000000000000e:  R_RISCV_CALL_PLT     _mcount
                000000000000004e:  R_RISCV_CALL_PLT     _mcount

After this, the __start_mcount_loc section is properly generated and
function tracing still works.
