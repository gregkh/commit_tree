bpf: tcp: Limit calling some tcp cc functions to CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE

pahole currently only generates the btf_id for external function and
ftrace-able function.  Some functions in the bpf_tcp_ca_kfunc_ids
are static (e.g. cubictcp_init).  Thus, unless CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
is set, btf_ids for those functions will not be generated and the
compilation fails during resolve_btfids.

This patch limits those functions to CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE.  I will
address the pahole generation in a followup and then remove the
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE limitation.
