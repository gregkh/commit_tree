tracing: Use a no_filter_buffering_ref to stop using the filter buffer

Currently, the trace histograms relies on it using absolute time stamps to
trigger the tracing to not use the temp buffer if filters are set. That's
because the histograms need the full timestamp that is saved in the ring
buffer. That is no longer the case, as the ring_buffer_event_time_stamp()
can now return the time stamp for all events without all triggering a full
absolute time stamp.

Now that the absolute time stamp is an unrelated dependency to not using
the filters. There's nothing about having absolute timestamps to keep from
using the filter buffer. Instead, change the interface to explicitly state
to disable filter buffering that the histogram logic can use.
