net: hns3: add get/set pause parameters support for imp-controlled PHYs

When the imp-controlled PHYs feature is enabled, phydev is NULL.
In this case, the autoneg is always off when user uses ethtool -a
command to get pause parameters because  hclge_get_pauseparam()
uses phydev to check whether device is TP port. To fit this new
feature, use media type to check whether device is TP port.

And when user set pause parameters, these parameters need to
always set to mac, no matter whether autoneg is off.
