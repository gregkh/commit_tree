serial: amba-pl010: drop low-latency workaround

Commit 2389b272168c ("[ARM] 4417/1: Serial: Fix AMBA drivers locking")
worked around the infamous low_latency behaviour of
tty_flip_buffer_push() by simply dropping and reacquiring the port lock
in the interrupt handler.

Since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.
