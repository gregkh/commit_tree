Makefile: Remove '--gcc-toolchain' flag

This flag was originally added to allow clang to find the GNU cross
tools in commit 785f11aa595b ("kbuild: Add better clang cross build
support"). This flag was not enough to find the tools at times so
'--prefix' was added to the list in commit ef8c4ed9db80 ("kbuild: allow
to use GCC toolchain not in Clang search path") and improved upon in
commit ca9b31f6bb9c ("Makefile: Fix GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR prefix for Clang
cross compilation"). Now that '--prefix' specifies a full path and
prefix, '--gcc-toolchain' serves no purpose because the kernel builds
with '-nostdinc' and '-nostdlib'.

This has been verified with self compiled LLVM 10.0.1 and LLVM 13.0.0 as
well as a distribution version of LLVM 11.1.0 without binutils in the
LLVM toolchain locations.
