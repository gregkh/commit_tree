powerpc/smp: Make some symbols static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

arch/powerpc/kernel/smp.c:86:1: warning:
 symbol '__pcpu_scope_cpu_coregroup_map' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kernel/smp.c:125:1: warning:
 symbol '__pcpu_scope_thread_group_l1_cache_map' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kernel/smp.c:132:1: warning:
 symbol '__pcpu_scope_thread_group_l2_cache_map' was not declared. Should it be static?

These symbols are not used outside of smp.c, so this
commit marks them static.
