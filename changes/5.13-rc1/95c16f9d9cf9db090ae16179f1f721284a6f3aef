binder: use EINTR for interrupted wait for work

when interrupted by a signal, binder_wait_for_work currently returns
-ERESTARTSYS. This error code isn't propagated to user space, but a way
to handle interruption due to signals must be provided to code using
this API.

Replace this instance of -ERESTARTSYS with -EINTR, which is propagated
to user space.
