drm/i915: Call primary encoder's .get_config() from MST .get_config()

Stop assuming intel_ddi_get_config() is all we need from the primary
encoder, and instead call it via the .get_config() vfunc. This
will allow customized .get_config() for the primary, which I plan
to use to handle the differences in the clock readout between various
platforms.
