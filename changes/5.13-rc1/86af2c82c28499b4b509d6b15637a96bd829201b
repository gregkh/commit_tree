gro: add combined call_gro_receive() + INDIRECT_CALL_INET() helper

call_gro_receive() is used to limit GRO recursion, but it works only
with callback pointers.
There's a combined version of call_gro_receive() + INDIRECT_CALL_2()
in <net/inet_common.h>, but it doesn't check for IPv6 modularity.
Add a similar new helper to cover both of these. It can and will be
used to avoid retpoline overhead when IP header lies behind another
offloaded proto.
