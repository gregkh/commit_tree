Revert "drivers/net/wan/hdlc_fr: Fix a double free in pvc_xmit"

This reverts commit 1b479fb80160
("drivers/net/wan/hdlc_fr: Fix a double free in pvc_xmit").

1. This commit is incorrect. "__skb_pad" will NOT free the skb on
failure when its "free_on_error" parameter is "false".

2. This commit claims to fix my commit. But it didn't CC me??
