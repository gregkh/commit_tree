dt-bindings: phy: qcom,qmp-usb3-dp-phy: move usb3 compatibles back to qcom,qmp-phy.yaml

The commit 724fabf5df13 ("dt-bindings: phy: qcom,qmp-usb3-dp: Add DP phy
information") has support for DP part of USB3+DP combo PHYs. However
this change is not backwards compatible, placing additional requirements
onto qcom,sc7180-qmp-usb3-phy and qcom,sdm845-qmp-usb3-phy device nodes
(to include separate DP part, etc). However the aforementioned nodes do
not inclue DP part, they strictly follow the schema defined in the
qcom,qmp-phy.yaml file. Move those compatibles, leaving
qcom,qmp-usb3-dp-phy.yaml to describe only real "combo" USB3+DP device nodes.
