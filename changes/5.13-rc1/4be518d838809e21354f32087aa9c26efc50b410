powerpc/iommu: Do not immediately panic when failed IOMMU table allocation

Most platforms allocate IOMMU table structures (specifically it_map)
at the boot time and when this fails - it is a valid reason for panic().

However the powernv platform allocates it_map after a device is returned
to the host OS after being passed through and this happens long after
the host OS booted. It is quite possible to trigger the it_map allocation
panic() and kill the host even though it is not necessary - the host OS
can still use the DMA bypass mode (requires a tiny fraction of it_map's
memory) and even if that fails, the host OS is runnnable as it was without
the device for which allocating it_map causes the panic.

Instead of immediately crashing in a powernv/ioda2 system, this prints
an error and continues. All other platforms still call panic().
