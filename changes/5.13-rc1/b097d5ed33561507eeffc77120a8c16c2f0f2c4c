futex: Get rid of the val2 conditional dance

There is no point in checking which FUTEX operand treats the utime pointer
as 'val2' argument because that argument to do_futex() is only used by
exactly these operands.

So just handing it in unconditionally is not making any difference, but
removes a lot of pointless gunk.
