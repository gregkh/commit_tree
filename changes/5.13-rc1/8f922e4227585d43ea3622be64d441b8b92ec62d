drm/i915: Restrict sentinel requests further

Disallow sentinel requests follow previous sentinels to make request
cancellation work better when faced with a chain of requests which have
all been marked as in error.

Because in cases where we end up with a stream of cancelled requests we
want to turn off request coalescing so they each will get individually
skipped by the execlists_schedule_in (which is called per ELSP port, not
per request).
