ftrace: Reuse the output of the function tracer for func_repeats

The func_repeats event shows the output of the function tracer followed by
a count of the number of repeats the previous function had made, as well
as the timestamp of the last function that was repeated.

The printing of the function should be the same as is for the function it
is displaying. Reuse the code in trace_fn_trace() by making a helper
function print_fn_trace() and use it for trace_func_repeats_print().
