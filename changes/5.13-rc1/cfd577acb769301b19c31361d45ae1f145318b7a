ALSA: usb: midi: don't return -ENOMEM when usb_urb_ep_type_check fails

Currently when the call to usb_urb_ep_type_check fails (returning -EINVAL)
the error return path returns -ENOMEM via the exit label "error". Other
uses of the same error exit label set the err variable to -ENOMEM but this
is not being used.  I believe the original intent was for the error exit
path to return the value in err rather than the hard coded -ENOMEM, so
return this rather than the hard coded -ENOMEM.
