mptcp: Retransmit DATA_FIN

With this change, the MPTCP-level retransmission timer is used to resend
DATA_FIN. The retranmit timer is not stopped while waiting for a
MPTCP-level ACK of DATA_FIN, and retransmitted DATA_FINs are sent on all
subflows. The retry interval starts at TCP_RTO_MIN and then doubles on
each attempt, up to TCP_RTO_MAX.
