iio:cdc:ad7150: Move driver out of staging.

This capacitance to digital converter (CDC) driver is compliant with
the IIO ABI.  Note, not all features supported (e.g. window event modes)
but the driver should be in a useful functional state.

The cleanup was done against QEMU emulation of the device rather than
actual hardware.   Whilst this was a bit of an experiment, it made it
easy to confirm that the driver remained in a consistent working state
through the various refactors.  If it worked in the first place, it
should still be working after this cleanup.

Given some IIO drivers require expensive hardware setups, (not particularly
true with this one) the use of QEMU may provide a viable way forward
for providing testing during code changes where previously we'd had
to rely on sharp eyes and crossed fingers.

Note, no explicit MAINTAINERS entry as it will be covered by the
generic catch-alls for ADI and IIO drivers which are sufficient.
