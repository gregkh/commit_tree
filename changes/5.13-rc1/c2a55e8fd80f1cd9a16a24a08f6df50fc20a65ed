selftests: mptcp: dump more info on mpjoin errors

Very occasionally, MPTCP selftests fail. Yeah, I saw that at least once!

Here we provide more details in case of errors with mptcp_join.sh script
like it was done with mptcp_connect.sh, see
commit 767389c8dd55 ("selftests: mptcp: dump more info on errors")
