mfd: ntxec: Support for EC in Tolino Shine 2 HD

Add the version of the EC in the Tolino Shine 2 HD
to the supported versions. It seems not to have an RTC
and does not ack data written to it.
The vendor kernel happily ignores write errors, using
I2C via userspace i2c-set also shows the error.
So add a quirk to ignore that error.

PWM can be successfully configured despite of that error.
