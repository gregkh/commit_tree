irqchip/xilinx: Expose Kconfig option for Zynq/ZynqMP

Previously the XILINX_INTC config option was hidden and only
auto-selected on the MicroBlaze platform. However, this IP can also be
used on the Zynq and ZynqMP platforms as a secondary cascaded
controller. Allow this option to be user-enabled on those platforms.
