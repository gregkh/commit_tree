dmaengine: idxd: fix dma device lifetime

The devm managed lifetime is incompatible with 'struct device' objects that
resides in idxd context. This is one of the series that clean up the idxd
driver 'struct device' lifetime. Remove embedding of dma_device and dma_chan
in idxd since it's not the only interface that idxd will use. The freeing of
the dma_device will be managed by the ->release() function.
