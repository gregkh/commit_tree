KVM: arm64: Enable access to sanitized CPU features at EL2

Introduce the infrastructure in KVM enabling to copy CPU feature
registers into EL2-owned data-structures, to allow reading sanitised
values directly at EL2 in nVHE.

Given that only a subset of these features are being read by the
hypervisor, the ones that need to be copied are to be listed under
<asm/kvm_cpufeature.h> together with the name of the nVHE variable that
will hold the copy. This introduces only the infrastructure enabling
this copy. The first users will follow shortly.
