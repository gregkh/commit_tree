ASoC: SOF: parse multiple SSP DAI and hw configs

ASoC parses multiple hw_configs defined in topology. However currently
in SOF only the first config is used and others are discarded. First
change SOF driver to parse and save possible multiple configs in ssp
case. Also save the default config value provided by ASoC. Functionality
with only one defined config stays the same.
