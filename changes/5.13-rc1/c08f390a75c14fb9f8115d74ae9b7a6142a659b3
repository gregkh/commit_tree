KVM: nSVM: only copy L1 non-VMLOAD/VMSAVE data in svm_set_nested_state()

The VMLOAD/VMSAVE data is not taken from userspace, since it will
not be restored on VMEXIT (it will be copied from VMCB02 to VMCB01).
For clarity, replace the wholesale copy of the VMCB save area
with a copy of that state only.
