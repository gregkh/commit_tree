dmaengine: dw-edma: Reorder variables to keep consistency

In the driver code structure, I tried to keep the code style consistency
by writing the write channels instructions first, and then follow by the
read channels instructions, mimicking the hardware implementation.

However, this code style failed in some cases. This patch fixes that and
no functional changes are expected.
