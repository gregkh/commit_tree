selftests: xsk: Remove sync_mutex_tx and atomic var

Although thread_common_ops() are called in both Tx and Rx threads,
testapp_validate() will not spawn Tx thread until Rx thread signals that
it has finished its initialization via condition variable.

Therefore, locking in thread_common_ops is not needed and furthermore Tx
thread does not have to spin on atomic variable.

Note that this simplification wouldn't be possible if there would still
be a common worker thread.
