fsnotify: use hash table for faster events merge

In order to improve event merge performance, hash events in a 128 size
hash table by the event merge key.

The fanotify_event size grows by two pointers, but we just reduced its
size by removing the objectid member, so overall its size is increased
by one pointer.

Permission events and overflow event are not merged so they are also
not hashed.
