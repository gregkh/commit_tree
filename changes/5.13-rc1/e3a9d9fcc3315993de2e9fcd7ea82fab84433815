mm,memory_hotplug: add kernel boot option to enable memmap_on_memory

Self stored memmap leads to a sparse memory situation which is
unsuitable for workloads that requires large contiguous memory chunks,
so make this an opt-in which needs to be explicitly enabled.

To control this, let memory_hotplug have its own memory space, as
suggested by David, so we can add memory_hotplug.memmap_on_memory
parameter.
