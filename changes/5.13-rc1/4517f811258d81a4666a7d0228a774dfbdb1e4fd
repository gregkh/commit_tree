rtw88: coex: fix A2DP stutters while WL busy + WL scan

While WL scan, WL is more high priority than BT. The packets from AP
will be a big interference to A2DP. It will lead to A2DP stutters. Stop
answering CTS to AP to decrease AP's packets Tx while WL scan + WL busy.
Enable BT AFH feature to make BT leave away from WL channel.

Desired BT firmware BT-COEX version: 0x1c
Desired WL firmware version: 9.9.x
