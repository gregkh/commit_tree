mmc: tmio: always restore irq register

Currently, only SDHI on R-Car Gen2+ reinitializes the irq register
during reset but it should be done on all instances. We can move it from
the SDHI driver to the TMIO core, because we now have the
'sd_irq_mask_all' variable which carries the proper value to use. That
also means we can remove the initialization from tmio_mmc_probe()
because it calls tmio_mmc_reset(), too. We only move that
tmio_mmc_reset() call there a little to ensure 'sd_irq_mask_all' is
properly set.
