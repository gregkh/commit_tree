scsi: lpfc: Fix stale node accesses on stale RRQ request

Whenever an RRQ needs to be triggered, the DID from the node structure and
node pointer are stored in the RRQ data structure and the RRQ is scheduled
for later transmission. However, at the point in time that the timer
triggers, there's no validation on the node pointer. Reference counters may
have freed the structure. Additionally the DID in the node may no longer be
valid.

Fix by not tracking the node pointer in the RRQ, only the DID. At the time
of the timer expiration, look up the node with the did and if present, send
the RRQ. If no node exists, no need to send the RRQ.
