KVM: VMX: Don't invalidate hv_tlb_eptp if the new EPTP matches

Don't invalidate the common EPTP, and thus trigger rechecking of EPTPs
across all vCPUs, if the new EPTP matches the old/common EPTP.  In all
likelihood this is a meaningless optimization, but there are (uncommon)
scenarios where KVM can reload the same EPTP.
