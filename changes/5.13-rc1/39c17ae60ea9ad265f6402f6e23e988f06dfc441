drm/tegra: Don't register DP AUX channels before connectors

As pointed out by the documentation for drm_dp_aux_register(),
drm_dp_aux_init() should be used in situations where the AUX channel for a
display driver can potentially be registered before it's respective DRM
driver. This is the case with Tegra, since the DP aux channel exists as a
platform device instead of being a grandchild of the DRM device.

Since we're about to add a backpointer to a DP AUX channel's respective DRM
device, let's fix this so that we don't potentially allow userspace to use
the AUX channel before we've associated it with it's DRM connector.
