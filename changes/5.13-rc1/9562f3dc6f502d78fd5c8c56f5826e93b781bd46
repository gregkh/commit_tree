arm64: add __nocfi to __apply_alternatives

__apply_alternatives makes indirect calls to functions whose address
is taken in assembly code using the alternative_cb macro. With
non-canonical CFI, the compiler won't replace these function
references with the jump table addresses, which trips CFI. Disable CFI
checking in the function to work around the issue.
