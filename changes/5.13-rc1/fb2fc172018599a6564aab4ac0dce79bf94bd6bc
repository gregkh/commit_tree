xfs: support shrinking unused space in the last AG

As the first step of shrinking, this attempts to enable shrinking
unused space in the last allocation group by fixing up freespace
btree, agi, agf and adjusting super block and use a helper
xfs_ag_shrink_space() to fixup the last AG.

This can be all done in one transaction for now, so I think no
additional protection is needed.
