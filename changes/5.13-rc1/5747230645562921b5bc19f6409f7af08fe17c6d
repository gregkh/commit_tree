powerpc/32: Remove ksp_limit

ksp_limit is there to help detect stack overflows.
That is specific to ppc32 as it was removed from ppc64 in
commit cbc9565ee826 ("powerpc: Remove ksp_limit on ppc64").

There are other means for detecting stack overflows.

As ppc64 has proven to not need it, ppc32 should be able to do
without it too.

Lets remove it and simplify exception handling.
