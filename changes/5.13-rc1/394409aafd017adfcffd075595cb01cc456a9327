regmap-irq: Add driver callback to configure virtual regs

Enable drivers to configure and modify "virtual" registers, which are
non-standard registers that further configure irq type on some devices.
Since they are non-standard, enable drivers to configure them according
to their particular idiosyncrasies by specifying an optional callback
function while registering with the framework.
