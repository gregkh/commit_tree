net: hns3: clear unnecessary reset request in hclge_reset_rebuild

HW error and global reset are reported through MSIX interrupts.
The same error may be reported to different functions at the
same time. When global reset begins, the pending reset request
set by this error is unnecessary. So clear the pending reset
request after the reset is complete to avoid the repeated reset.
