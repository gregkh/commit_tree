staging: rtl8723bs: remove commented code block

remove commented 5G code block in hal/hal_com_phycfg.c
which contained removed RT_TRACE log

as reported in the driver's TODO file:

    - find and remove remaining code valid only for 5 GHz.
      Most of the obvious ones have been removed,
      but things like channel > 14 still exist.

so just removed obsolete commented code.
