ASoC: Intel: KMB: Fix random noise at the HDMI output

Random noise could be heard when playing audio to the HDMI output.
This is due to the IEC conversion is invoked in the external loop.
As a result, this additional loop takes up a lot of the processing
cycle.

hdmi_reformat_iec958() process the conversion using an internal loop,
it is safe to move it out from the external loop to avoid unnecessary
processing cycle been spent. Furthermore, ALSA IEC958 plugin works in
32bit format only.
