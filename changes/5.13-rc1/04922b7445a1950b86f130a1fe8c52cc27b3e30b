dmaengine: idxd: fix cdev setup and free device lifetime issues

The char device setup and cleanup has device lifetime issues regarding when
parts are initialized and cleaned up. The initialization of struct device is
done incorrectly. device_initialize() needs to be called on the 'struct
device' and then additional changes can be added. The ->release() function
needs to be setup via device_type before dev_set_name() to allow proper
cleanup. The change re-parents the cdev under the wq->conf_dev to get
natural reference inheritance. No known dependency on the old device path exists.
