tipc: simplify api between binding table and topology server

The function tipc_report_overlap() is called from the binding table
with numerous parameters taken from an instance of struct publication.
A closer look reveals that it always is safe to send along a pointer
to the instance itself, and hence reduce the call signature. We do
that in this commit.
