KVM: MMU: load PDPTRs outside mmu_lock

On SVM, reading PDPTRs might access guest memory, which might fault
and thus might sleep.  On the other hand, it is not possible to
release the lock after make_mmu_pages_available has been called.

Therefore, push the call to make_mmu_pages_available and the
mmu_lock critical section within mmu_alloc_direct_roots and
mmu_alloc_shadow_roots.
