selftests: mptcp: add packet mark test case

Extend mptcp_connect tool with SO_MARK support (-M <value>) and
add a test case that checks that the packet mark gets copied to all
subflows.

This is done by only allowing packets with either skb->mark 1 or 2
via iptables.

DROP rule packet counter is checked; if its not zero, print an error
message and fail the test case.
