nvme: introduce generic per-namespace chardev

Userspace has not been allowed to I/O to device that's failed to
be initialized.  This patch introduces generic per-namespace character
device to allow userspace to I/O regardless the block device is there or
not.

The chardev naming convention will similar to the existing blkdev naming,
using a ng prefix instead of nvme, i.e.

	- /dev/ngXnY

It also supports multipath which means it will not expose chardev for the
hidden namespace blkdevs (e.g., nvmeXcYnZ).  If /dev/ngXnY is created for
a ns_head, then I/O request will be routed to a specific controller
selected by the iopolicy of the subsystem.
