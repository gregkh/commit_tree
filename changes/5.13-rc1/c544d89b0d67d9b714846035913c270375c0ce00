iwlwifi: pcie: don't enable BHs with IRQs disabled

After the fix from Jiri that disabled local IRQs instead of
just BHs (necessary to fix an issue with submitting a command
with IRQs already disabled), there was still a situation in
which we could deep in there enable BHs, if the device config
sets the apmg_wake_up_wa configuration, which is true on all
7000 series devices.

To fix that, but not require reverting commit 1ed08f6fb5ae
("iwlwifi: remove flags argument for nic_access"), split up
nic access into a version with BH manipulation to use most
of the time, and without it for this specific case where the
local IRQs are already disabled.
