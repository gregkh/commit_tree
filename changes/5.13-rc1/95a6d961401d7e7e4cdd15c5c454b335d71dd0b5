Input: iqs5xx - close bootloader using hardware reset

The bootloader can be closed using the 'execute' command (0x02) or
hardware reset. Rather than using the former option for successful
firmware update procedures and reserving the latter for recovering
the device upon failure, simply use hardware reset for all cases.

The post-bootloader initialization delay increases marginally when
triggered by a hardware reset, so increase the wait time to ensure
the device does not subsequently fail to respond.

As part of this change, refactor the return path to avoid an extra
assignment and to make the logic a bit smaller.
