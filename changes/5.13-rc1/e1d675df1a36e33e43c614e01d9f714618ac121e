io_uring: don't init req->work fully in advance

req->work is mostly unused unless it's punted, and io_init_req() is too
hot for fully initialising it. Fortunately, we can skip init work.next
as it's controlled by io-wq, and can not touch work.flags by moving
everything related into io_prep_async_work(). The only field left is
req->work.creds, but there is nothing can be done, keep maintaining it.
