printk: clarify the documentation for plain pointer printing

We have several modifiers for plain pointers (%p, %px and %pK) and now
also the no_hash_pointers boot parameter. The documentation should help
to choose which variant to use. Importantly, we should discourage %px
in favor of %p (with the new boot parameter when debugging), and stress
that %pK should be only used for procfs and similar files, not dmesg
buffer. This patch clarifies the documentation in that regard.
