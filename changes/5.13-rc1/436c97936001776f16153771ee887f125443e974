serial: stm32: fix a deadlock in set_termios

CTS/RTS GPIOs support that has been added recently to STM32 UART driver has
introduced scheduled code in a set_termios part protected by a spin lock.
This generates a potential deadlock scenario:

Chain exists of:
&irq_desc_lock_class --> console_owner --> &port_lock_key

Possible unsafe locking scenario:

     CPU0                    CPU1
     ----                    ----
lock(&port_lock_key);
                           lock(console_owner);
                           lock(&port_lock_key);
lock(&irq_desc_lock_class);

*** DEADLOCK ***
4 locks held by stty/766:

Move the scheduled code after the spinlock.
