KVM: MMU: protect TDP MMU pages only down to required level

When using manual protection of dirty pages, it is not necessary
to protect nested page tables down to the 4K level; instead KVM
can protect only hugepages in order to split them lazily, and
delay write protection at 4K-granularity until KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG.
This was overlooked in the TDP MMU, so do it there as well.
