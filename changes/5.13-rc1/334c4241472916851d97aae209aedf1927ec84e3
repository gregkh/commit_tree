ibmvnic: improve failover sysfs entry

The current implementation relies on H_IOCTL call to issue a
H_SESSION_ERR_DETECTED command to let the hypervisor to send a failover
signal. However, it may not work if there is no backup device or if
the vnic is already in error state,
e.g., "ibmvnic 30000003 env3: rx buffer returned with rc 6".
Add a last resort, that is to schedule a failover reset via CRQ command.
