tracing: Map all PIDs to command lines

The default max PID is set by PID_MAX_DEFAULT, and the tracing
infrastructure uses this number to map PIDs to the comm names of the
tasks, such output of the trace can show names from the recorded PIDs in
the ring buffer. This mapping is also exported to user space via the
"saved_cmdlines" file in the tracefs directory.

But currently the mapping expects the PIDs to be less than
PID_MAX_DEFAULT, which is the default maximum and not the real maximum.
Recently, systemd will increases the maximum value of a PID on the system,
and when tasks are traced that have a PID higher than PID_MAX_DEFAULT, its
comm is not recorded. This leads to the entire trace to have "<...>" as
the comm name, which is pretty useless.

Instead, keep the array mapping the size of PID_MAX_DEFAULT, but instead
of just mapping the index to the comm, map a mask of the PID
(PID_MAX_DEFAULT - 1) to the comm, and find the full PID from the
map_cmdline_to_pid array (that already exists).

This bug goes back to the beginning of ftrace, but hasn't been an issue
until user space started increasing the maximum value of PIDs.
