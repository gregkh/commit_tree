locking/rtmutex: Make text section and inlining consistent

rtmutex is half __sched and the other half is not. If the compiler decides
to not inline larger static functions then part of the code ends up in the
regular text section.

There are also quite some performance related small helpers which are
either static or plain inline. Force inline those which make sense and mark
the rest __sched.
