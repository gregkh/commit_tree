KVM: vmx: add mismatched size assertions in vmcs_check32()

Add compile-time assertions in vmcs_check32() to disallow accesses to
64-bit and 64-bit high fields via vmcs_{read,write}32().  Upper level KVM
code should never do partial accesses to VMCS fields.  KVM handles the
split accesses automatically in vmcs_{read,write}64() when running as a
32-bit kernel.
