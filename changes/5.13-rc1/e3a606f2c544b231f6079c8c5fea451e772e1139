fsverity: relax build time dependency on CRYPTO_SHA256

CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256 denotes the generic C implementation of the SHA-256
shash algorithm, which is selected as the default crypto shash provider
for fsverity. However, fsverity has no strict link time dependency, and
the same shash could be exposed by an optimized implementation, and arm64
has a number of those (scalar, NEON-based and one based on special crypto
instructions). In such cases, it makes little sense to require that the
generic C implementation is incorporated as well, given that it will never
be called.

To address this, relax the 'select' clause to 'imply' so that the generic
driver can be omitted from the build if desired.
