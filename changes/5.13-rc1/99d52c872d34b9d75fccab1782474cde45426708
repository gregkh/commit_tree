MAINTAINERS: add another entry for ARM/QUALCOMM SUPPORT

The files in ./include/linux/soc/qcom/ are headers to the corresponding
files in ./drivers/soc/qcom/, which are assigned to ARM/QUALCOMM SUPPORT.

Possibly, the file pattern include/linux/*/qcom* intended to match this
directory and its containing files, but unfortunately, it does not.

Hence, add a file entry for this directory to ARM/QUALCOMM SUPPORT.
