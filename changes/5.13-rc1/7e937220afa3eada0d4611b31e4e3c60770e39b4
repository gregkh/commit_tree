rcu: Add explicit barrier() to __rcu_read_unlock()

Because preemptible RCU's __rcu_read_unlock() is an external function,
the rough equivalent of an implicit barrier() is inserted by the compiler.
Except that there is a direct call to __rcu_read_unlock() in that same
file, and compilers are getting to the point where they might choose to
inline the fastpath of the __rcu_read_unlock() function.

This commit therefore adds an explicit barrier() to the very beginning
of __rcu_read_unlock().
