vfio/mdev: Add missing reference counting to mdev_type

struct mdev_type holds a pointer to the kref'd object struct mdev_parent,
but doesn't hold the kref. The lifetime of the parent becomes implicit
because parent_remove_sysfs_files() is supposed to remove all the access
before the parent can be freed, but this is very hard to reason about.

Make it obviously correct by adding the missing get.
