powerpc/xive: Introduce an IPI interrupt domain

The IPI interrupt is a special case of the XIVE IRQ domain. When
mapping and unmapping the interrupts in the Linux interrupt number
space, the HW interrupt number 0 (XIVE_IPI_HW_IRQ) is checked to
distinguish the IPI interrupt from other interrupts of the system.

Simplify the XIVE interrupt domain by introducing a specific domain
for the IPI.
