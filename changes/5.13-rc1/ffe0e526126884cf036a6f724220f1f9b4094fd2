RISC-V: Improve init_resources()

The kernel region is always present and we know where it is, no need to
look for it inside the loop, just ignore it like the rest of the
reserved regions within system's memory.

Additionally, we don't need to call memblock_free inside the loop, as if
called it'll split the region of pre-allocated resources in two parts,
messing things up, just re-use the previous pre-allocated resource and
free any unused resources after both loops finish.
