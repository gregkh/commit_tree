net: phy: marvell: fix m88e1011_set_downshift

Changing downshift params without software reset has no effect,
so call genphy_soft_reset() after change downshift params.

As the datasheet says:
Changes to these bits are disruptive to the normal operation therefore,
any changes to these registers must be followed by software reset
to take effect.
