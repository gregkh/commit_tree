PCI/MSI: Let PCI host bridges declare their reliance on MSI domains

There is a whole class of host bridges that cannot know whether
MSIs will be provided or not, as they rely on other blocks
to provide the MSI functionnality, using MSI domains.  This is
the case for example on systems that use the ARM GIC architecture.

Introduce a new attribute ('msi_domain') indicating that implicit
dependency, and use this property to set the NO_MSI flag when
no MSI domain is found at probe time.
