iio: accel: bmc150: Set label based on accel-location on 2-accel yoga-style 2-in-1s

Some 2-in-1 laptops / convertibles with 360Â° (yoga-style) hinges,
use 2 bmc150 accelerometers, defined by a single BOSC0200 ACPI
device node (1 in their base and 1 in their display).

Since in this case we know the location of each accelerometer,
set the label for the accelerometers to the standardized
"accel-display" resp. "accel-base" labels. This way userspace
can use the labels to get the location.

This was tested on a Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e 4th gen (N3450 CPU).
