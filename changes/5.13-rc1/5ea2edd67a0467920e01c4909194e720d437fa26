power: supply: surface-battery: Make some symbols static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/power/supply/surface_battery.c:700:1: warning:
 symbol 'dev_attr_alarm' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/power/supply/surface_battery.c:805:1: warning:
 symbol 'surface_battery_pm_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of surface_battery.c, so this
commit marks it static.
