powerpc/uaccess: Remove calls to __get_user_bad() and __put_user_bad()

__get_user_bad() and __put_user_bad() are functions that are
declared but not defined, in order to make the link fail in
case they are called.

Nowadays, we have BUILD_BUG() and BUILD_BUG_ON() for that, and
they have the advantage to break the build earlier as it breaks
it at compile time instead of link time.
