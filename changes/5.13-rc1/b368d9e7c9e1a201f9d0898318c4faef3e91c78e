dt-bindings: ddr: Add optional manufacturer and revision ID to LPDDR3

On some platforms, DDR parts are multi-sourced and the exact part number
used is not know to either kernel or firmware at build time. Firmware
can read identifying information from DDR mode registers at boot time
but needs a way to communicate this information to kernel and/or
userspace. This patch adds optional properties for this information to
the existing "jedec,lpddr3" device tree binding to be used for that
purpose.
