fanotify: reduce event objectid to 29-bit hash

objectid is only used by fanotify backend and it is just an optimization
for event merge before comparing all fields in event.

Move the objectid member from common struct fsnotify_event into struct
fanotify_event and reduce it to 29-bit hash to cram it together with the
3-bit event type.

Events of different types are never merged, so the combination of event
type and hash form a 32-bit key for fast compare of events.

This reduces the size of events by one pointer and paves the way for
adding hashed queue support for fanotify.
