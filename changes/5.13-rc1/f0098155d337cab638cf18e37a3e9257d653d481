arm64: Always keep DAIF.[IF] in sync

Apple SoCs (A11 and newer) have some interrupt sources hardwired to the
FIQ line. We implement support for this by simply treating IRQs and FIQs
the same way in the interrupt vectors.

To support these systems, the FIQ mask bit needs to be kept in sync with
the IRQ mask bit, so both kinds of exceptions are masked together. No
other platforms should be delivering FIQ exceptions right now, and we
already unmask FIQ in normal process context, so this should not have an
effect on other systems - if spurious FIQs were arriving, they would
already panic the kernel.
