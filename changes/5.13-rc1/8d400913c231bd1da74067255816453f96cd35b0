x86/vmemmap: handle unpopulated sub-pmd ranges

When sizeof(struct page) is not a power of 2, sections do not span a PMD
anymore and so when populating them some parts of the PMD will remain
unused.

Because of this, PMDs will be left behind when depopulating sections since
remove_pmd_table() thinks that those unused parts are still in use.

Fix this by marking the unused parts with PAGE_UNUSED, so memchr_inv()
will do the right thing and will let us free the PMD when the last user of
it is gone.

This patch is based on a similar patch by David Hildenbrand:
