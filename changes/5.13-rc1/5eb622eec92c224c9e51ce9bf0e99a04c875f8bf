backlight: qcom-wled: Correct the sync_toggle sequence

As per the current implementation, after FSC (Full Scale Current)
and brightness update the sync bits are set-then-cleared.
But, the FSC and brightness sync takes place when the sync bits are
set (e.g. on a rising edge). So the hardware team recommends a
clear-then-set approach in order to guarantee such a transition
regardless of the previous register state.
