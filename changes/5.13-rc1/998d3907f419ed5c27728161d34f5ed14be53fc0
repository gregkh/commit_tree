tipc: re-organize members of struct publication

In a future commit we will introduce more members to struct publication.
In order to keep this structure comprehensible we now group some of
its current fields into the sub-structures where they really belong,
- A struct tipc_service_range for the functional address the publication
  is representing.
- A struct tipc_socket_addr for the socket bound to that service range.

We also rename the stack variable 'publ' to just 'p' in a few places.
This is just as easy to understand in the given context, and keeps the
number of wrapped code lines to a minimum.

There are no functional changes in this commit.
