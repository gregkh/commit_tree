ALSA: hda/realtek: Re-order ALC269 HP quirk table entries

Just re-order the alc269_fixup_tbl[] entries for HP devices for
avoiding the oversight of the duplicated or unapplied item in future.
No functional changes.

Formerly, some entries were grouped for the actual codec, but this
doesn't seem reasonable to keep in that way.  So now we simply keep
the PCI SSID order for the whole.

Also Cc-to-stable for the further patch applications.
