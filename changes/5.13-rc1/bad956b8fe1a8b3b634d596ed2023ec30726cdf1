powerpc/uaccess: Remove __get/put_user_inatomic()

Powerpc is the only architecture having _inatomic variants of
__get_user() and __put_user() accessors. They were introduced
by commit e68c825bb016 ("[POWERPC] Add inatomic versions of __get_user
and __put_user").

Those variants expand to the _nosleep macros instead of expanding
to the _nocheck macros. The only difference between the _nocheck
and the _nosleep macros is the call to might_fault().

Since commit 662bbcb2747c ("mm, sched: Allow uaccess in atomic with
pagefault_disable()"), __get/put_user() can be used in atomic parts
of the code, therefore __get/put_user_inatomic() have become useless.

Remove __get_user_inatomic() and __put_user_inatomic().
