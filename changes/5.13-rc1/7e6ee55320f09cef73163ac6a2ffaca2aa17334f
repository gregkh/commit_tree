drm/msm/disp/dpu1: enable DATA_HCTL_EN for sc7280 target

The reset value of INTF_CONFIG2 register is changed
for SC7280 family. Changes are added to program
this register correctly based on the target.

DATA_HCTL_EN in INTF_CONFIG2 register allows data
to be transferred at a different rate than video
timing. When this is set, the number of data per
line follows DISPLAY_DATA_HCTL register value.
This change adds support to program these
registers for sc7280 target.
