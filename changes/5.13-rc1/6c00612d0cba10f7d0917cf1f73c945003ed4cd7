iommu/vt-d: Report right snoop capability when using FL for IOVA

The Intel VT-d driver checks wrong register to report snoop capablility
when using first level page table for GPA to HPA translation. This might
lead the IOMMU driver to say that it supports snooping control, but in
reality, it does not. Fix this by always setting PASID-table-entry.PGSNP
whenever a pasid entry is setting up for GPA to HPA translation so that
the IOMMU driver could report snoop capability as long as it runs in the
scalable mode.
