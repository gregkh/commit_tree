video: fbdev: simplefb: Fix info message during probe

The info message was showing the mapped address for the framebuffer. To avoid
security problems, all virtual addresses are converted to __ptrval__, so
the message has pointless information:

simple-framebuffer 3ea9b000.framebuffer: framebuffer at 0x3ea9b000, 0x12c000 bytes, mapped to 0x(____ptrval____)

Drop the extraneous bits to clean up the message:

simple-framebuffer 3ea9b000.framebuffer: framebuffer at 0x3ea9b000, 0x12c000 bytes
