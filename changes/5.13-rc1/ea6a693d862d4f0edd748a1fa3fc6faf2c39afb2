io_uring: disable multishot poll for double poll add cases

The re-add handling isn't correct for the multi wait case, so let's
just disable it for now explicitly until we can get that sorted out. This
just turns it into a one-shot request. Since we pass back whether or not
a poll request terminates in multishot mode on completion, this should
not break properly behaving applications that check for IORING_CQE_F_MORE
on completion.
