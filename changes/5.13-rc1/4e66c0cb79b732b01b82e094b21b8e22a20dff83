KVM: x86: Add support for reverse CPUID lookup of scattered features

Introduce a scheme that allows KVM's CPUID magic to support features
that are scattered in the kernel's feature words.  To advertise and/or
query guest support for CPUID-based features, KVM requires the bit
number of an X86_FEATURE_* to match the bit number in its associated
CPUID entry.  For scattered features, this does not hold true.

Add a framework to allow defining KVM-only words, stored in
kvm_cpu_caps after the shared kernel caps, that can be used to gather
the scattered feature bits by translating X86_FEATURE_* flags into their
KVM-defined feature.

Note, because reverse_cpuid_check() effectively forces kvm_cpu_caps
lookups to be resolved at compile time, there is no runtime cost for
translating from kernel-defined to kvm-defined features.
