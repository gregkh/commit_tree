KVM: s390: diag9c (directed yield) forwarding

When we intercept a DIAG_9C from the guest we verify that the
target real CPU associated with the virtual CPU designated by
the guest is running and if not we forward the DIAG_9C to the
target real CPU.

To avoid a diag9c storm we allow a maximal rate of diag9c forwarding.

The rate is calculated as a count per second defined as a new
parameter of the s390 kvm module: diag9c_forwarding_hz .

The default value of 0 is to not forward diag9c.
