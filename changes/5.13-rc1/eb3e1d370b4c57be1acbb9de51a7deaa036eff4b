clocksource/drivers/hyper-v: Handle sched_clock differences inline

While the Hyper-V Reference TSC code is architecture neutral, the
pv_ops.time.sched_clock() function is implemented for x86/x64, but not
for ARM64. Current code calls a utility function under arch/x86 (and
coming, under arch/arm64) to handle the difference.

Change this approach to handle the difference inline based on whether
GENERIC_SCHED_CLOCK is present.  The new approach removes code under
arch/* since the difference is tied more to the specifics of the Linux
implementation than to the architecture.

No functional change.
