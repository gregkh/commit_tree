f2fs: fix a redundant call to f2fs_balance_fs if an error occurs

The  uninitialized variable dn.node_changed does not get set when a
call to f2fs_get_node_page fails.  This uninitialized value gets used
in the call to f2fs_balance_fs() that may or not may not balances
dirty node and dentry pages depending on the uninitialized state of
the variable. Fix this by only calling f2fs_balance_fs if err is
not set.

Thanks to Jaegeuk Kim for suggesting an appropriate fix.
