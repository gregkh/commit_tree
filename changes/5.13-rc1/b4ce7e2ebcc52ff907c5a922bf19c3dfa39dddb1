rpmsg: char: Use rpmsg_sendto to specify the message destination address

When the endpoint device is created by the application, a destination
address is specified in the rpmsg_channel_info structure. Since the
rpmsg_endpoint structure does not store the destination address,
this destination address must be specified when sending a message.

Replaces rpmsg_send with rpmsg_sendto to allow to specify the
destination address. This implementation is requested for compatibly with
some rpmsg backends like the virtio backend.

For this, the GLINK an SMD drivers have been updated to support the
rpmsg_sendto, even if the destination address is ignored for these
backends. For these drivers, the rpmsg_send and rpmsg_trysend ops are
preserved to avoid breaking the legacy.
