mt7601u: fix always true expression

Currently the expression ~nic_conf1 is always true because nic_conf1
is a u16 and according to 6.5.3.3 of the C standard the ~ operator
promotes the u16 to an integer before flipping all the bits. Thus
the top 16 bits of the integer result are all set so the expression
is always true.  If the intention was to flip all the bits of nic_conf1
then casting the integer result back to a u16 is a suitabel fix.

Interestingly static analyzers seem to thing a bitwise ! should be
used instead of ~ for this scenario, so I think the original intent
of the expression may need some extra consideration.
