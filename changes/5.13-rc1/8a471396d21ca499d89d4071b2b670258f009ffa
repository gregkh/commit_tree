remoteproc: stm32: Move resource table setup to rproc_ops

Move the setting of the resource table installed by an external
entity to rproc_ops::get_loaded_rsc_table().  This is to support
scenarios where a remote processor has been attached to but is
detached at a later stage.  To re-attach the remote processor,
the address of the resource table needs to be available
at a later time than the platform driver's probe() function.
