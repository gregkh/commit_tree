tick/broadcast: Allow late registered device to enter oneshot mode

The broadcast device is switched to oneshot mode when the system switches
to oneshot mode. If a broadcast clock event device is registered after the
system switched to oneshot mode, it will stay in periodic mode forever.

Ensure that a late registered device which is selected as broadcast device
is initialized in oneshot mode when the system already uses oneshot mode.
