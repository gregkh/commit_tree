xen-swiotlb: use is_swiotlb_buffer in is_xen_swiotlb_buffer

Use the is_swiotlb_buffer to check if a physical address is
a swiotlb buffer.  This works because xen-swiotlb does use the
same buffer as the main swiotlb code, and xen_io_tlb_{start,end}
are just the addresses for it that went through phys_to_virt.
