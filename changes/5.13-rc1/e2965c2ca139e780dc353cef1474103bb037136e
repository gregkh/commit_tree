ASoC: tegra30: ahub: Correct suspend-resume callbacks

Tegra30 AHUB driver always syncs hardware state on a runtime PM resume,
hence there is no needed to re-sync the state on system resume. Replace
the suspend-resume callbacks with a generic helpers which ensure that
AHUB is suspended using RPM callbacks across system suspend-resume.
