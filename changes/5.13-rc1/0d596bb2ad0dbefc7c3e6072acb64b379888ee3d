iio: core: rename 'dev' -> 'indio_dev' in iio_device_alloc()

The 'dev' variable name usually refers to 'struct device' types. However in
iio_device_alloc() this was used for the 'struct iio_dev' type, which was
sometimes causing minor confusions.

This change renames the variable to 'indio_dev', which is the usual name
used around IIO for 'struct iio_dev' type objects.
It makes grepping a bit easier as well.
