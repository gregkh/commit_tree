iio:accel:adis16201: Fix wrong axis assignment that prevents loading

Whilst running some basic tests as part of writing up the dt-bindings for
this driver (to follow), it became clear it doesn't actually load
currently.

iio iio:device1: tried to double register : in_incli_x_index
adis16201 spi0.0: Failed to create buffer sysfs interfaces
adis16201: probe of spi0.0 failed with error -16

Looks like a cut and paste / update bug.  Fixes tag obviously not accurate
but we don't want to bother carry thing back to before the driver moved
out of staging.
