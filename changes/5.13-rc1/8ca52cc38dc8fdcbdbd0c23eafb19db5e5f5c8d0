x86/sgx: Expose SGX architectural definitions to the kernel

Expose SGX architectural structures, as KVM will use many of the
architectural constants and structs to virtualize SGX.

Name the new header file as asm/sgx.h, rather than asm/sgx_arch.h, to
have single header to provide SGX facilities to share with other kernel
componments. Also update MAINTAINERS to include asm/sgx.h.
