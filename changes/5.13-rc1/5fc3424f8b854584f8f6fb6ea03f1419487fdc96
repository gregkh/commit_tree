KVM: x86/mmu: Make Host-writable and MMU-writable bit locations dynamic

Make the location of the HOST_WRITABLE and MMU_WRITABLE configurable for
a given KVM instance.  This will allow EPT to use high available bits,
which in turn will free up bit 11 for a constant MMU_PRESENT bit.

No functional change intended.
