IB/mthca: Disable parity reporting

For Mellanox Tavor devices, we previously set dev->broken_parity_status,
which does not change the device's behavior; it merely prevents the EDAC
PCI error reporting from warning about Master Data Parity Error, Signaled
System Error, or Detected Parity Error for this device.

Instead, disable Parity Error Response so the device doesn't report
parity errors in the first place.
