ASoC: Intel: soc-acpi: remove unused TGL table with rt5682 only

This patch partially reverts Commit 095ee71907ea ("ASoC: Intel: common: add match table for TGL RT5682 SoundWire driver").

This commit was added as an enabling patch before the Maxim98373 codec
driver was available. This codec is now fully functional and the
topology with only RT5682 no longer maintained or used.
