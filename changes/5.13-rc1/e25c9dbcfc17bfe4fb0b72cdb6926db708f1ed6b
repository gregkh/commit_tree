phy: cadence-torrent: Update PCIe + QSGMII config for correct PLL1 clock

For PCIe + QSGMII configuration where QSGMII was using PLL1 and was
expecting 10GHz clock, configuration was giving 8GHz clock. Update
register sequences to get correct PLL1 configuration.

Also, update single link PCIe and single link SGMII/QSGMII configurations
with related changes.
