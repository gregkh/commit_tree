btrfs: remove unnecessary leaf check at btrfs_tree_mod_log_free_eb()

At btrfs_tree_mod_log_free_eb() we check if we are dealing with a leaf,
and if so, return immediately and do nothing. However this check can be
removed, because after it we call tree_mod_need_log(), which returns
false when given an extent buffer that corresponds to a leaf.

So just remove the leaf check and pass the extent buffer to
tree_mod_need_log().
