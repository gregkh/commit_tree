mm: memcontrol: directly access page->memcg_data in mm/page_alloc.c

page_memcg() is not suitable for use by page_expected_state() and
page_bad_reason().  Because it can BUG_ON() for the slab pages when
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is enabled.  As neither lru, nor kmem, nor slab page
should have anything left in there by the time the page is freed, what
we care about is whether the value of page->memcg_data is 0.  So just
directly access page->memcg_data here.
