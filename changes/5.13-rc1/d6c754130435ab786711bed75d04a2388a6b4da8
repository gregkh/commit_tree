perf/x86/intel/uncore: Generic support for the MSR type of uncore blocks

The discovery table provides the generic uncore block information for
the MSR type of uncore blocks, e.g., the counter width, the number of
counters, the location of control/counter registers, which is good
enough to provide basic uncore support. It can be used as a fallback
solution when the kernel doesn't support a platform.

The name of the uncore box cannot be retrieved from the discovery table.
uncore_type_&typeID_&boxID will be used as its name. Save the type ID
and the box ID information in the struct intel_uncore_type.
Factor out uncore_get_pmu_name() to handle different naming methods.

Implement generic support for the MSR type of uncore block.

Some advanced features, such as filters and constraints, cannot be
retrieved from discovery tables. Features that rely on that
information are not be supported here.
