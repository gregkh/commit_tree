ASoC: arizona-jack: Move jack-detect variables to struct arizona_priv

Move all the jack-detect variables from struct arizona_extcon_info to
struct arizona_priv.

This is part of a patch series converting the arizona extcon driver into
a helper library for letting the arizona codec-drivers directly report jack
state through the standard sound/soc/soc-jack.c functions.
