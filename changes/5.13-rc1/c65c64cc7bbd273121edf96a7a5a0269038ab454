powerpc/selftests/perf-hwbreak: Add testcases for 2nd DAWR

Extend perf-hwbreak.c selftest to test multiple DAWRs. Also add
testcase for testing 512 byte boundary removal.

Sample o/p:
  # ./perf-hwbreak
  ...
  TESTED: Process specific, Two events, diff addr
  TESTED: Process specific, Two events, same addr
  TESTED: Process specific, Two events, diff addr, one is RO, other is WO
  TESTED: Process specific, Two events, same addr, one is RO, other is WO
  TESTED: Systemwide, Two events, diff addr
  TESTED: Systemwide, Two events, same addr
  TESTED: Systemwide, Two events, diff addr, one is RO, other is WO
  TESTED: Systemwide, Two events, same addr, one is RO, other is WO
  TESTED: Process specific, 512 bytes, unaligned
  success: perf_hwbreak
