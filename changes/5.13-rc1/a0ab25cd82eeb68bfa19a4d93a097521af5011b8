drivers/perf: hisi: Add support for HiSilicon PA PMU driver

On HiSilicon Hip09 platform, there is a PA (Protocol Adapter) module on
each chip SICL (Super I/O Cluster) which incorporates three Hydra interface
and facilitates the cache coherency between the dies on the chip. While PA
uncore PMU model is the same as other Hip09 PMU modules and many PMU events
are supported. Let's support the PMU driver using the HiSilicon uncore PMU
framework.

PA PMU supports the following filter functions:
* tracetag_en: allows user to count events according to tt_req or
tt_core set in L3C PMU. It's the same as other PMUs.

* srcid_cmd & srcid_msk: allows user to filter statistics that come from
specific CCL/ICL by configuration source ID.

* tgtid_cmd & tgtid_msk: it is the similar function to srcid_cmd &
srcid_msk. Both are used to check where the data comes from or go to.
