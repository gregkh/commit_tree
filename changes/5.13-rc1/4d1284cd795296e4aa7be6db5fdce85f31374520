ASoC: SOF: Simplify sof_probe_complete handling for acpi/pci/of

Set the sof_data->sof_probe_complete callback unconditionally of
CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_PROBE_WORK_QUEUE.

The sof_probe_complete will be called when the sof_probe_continue()
function is successfully executed, called either directly from
snd_sof_device_probe() or from the scheduled work.

Since all error cases within the call chain of snd_sof_device_probe() have
error prints, there is no need to print again in the acpi/pci/of level.
