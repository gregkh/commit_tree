vfio/pci: Re-order vfio_pci_probe()

vfio_add_group_dev() must be called only after all of the private data in
vdev is fully setup and ready, otherwise there could be races with user
space instantiating a device file descriptor and starting to call ops.

For instance vfio_pci_reflck_attach() sets vdev->reflck and
vfio_pci_open(), called by fops open, unconditionally derefs it, which
will crash if things get out of order.
