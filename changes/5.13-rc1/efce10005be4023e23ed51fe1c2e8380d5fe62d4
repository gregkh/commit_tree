drm/amdgpu: enable xgmi support for Aldebaran

Like its predecessors Aldebran also supports advanced high bandwidth
GPU-GPU communication interface known as xgmi. This enables the basic
xgmi support while refactoring the code slightly.

Detection of xgmi link between host cpu and gpu will be introduced in a
different patch.
