KVM: x86/mmu: handle cmpxchg failure in kvm_tdp_mmu_get_root

To reduce dependence on the MMU write lock, don't rely on the assumption
that the atomic operation in kvm_tdp_mmu_get_root will always succeed.
By not relying on that assumption, threads do not need to hold the MMU
lock in write mode in order to take a reference on a TDP MMU root.

In the root iterator, this change means that some roots might have to be
skipped if they are found to have a zero refcount. This will still never
happen as of this patch, but a future patch will need that flexibility to
make the root iterator safe under the MMU read lock.
