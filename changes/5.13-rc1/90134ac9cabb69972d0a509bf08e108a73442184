KVM: arm64: Protect the .hyp sections from the host

When KVM runs in nVHE protected mode, use the host stage 2 to unmap the
hypervisor sections by marking them as owned by the hypervisor itself.
The long-term goal is to ensure the EL2 code can remain robust
regardless of the host's state, so this starts by making sure the host
cannot e.g. write to the .hyp sections directly.
