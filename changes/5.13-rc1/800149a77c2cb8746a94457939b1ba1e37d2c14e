riscv: sifive: Apply errata "cip-453" patch

Add sign extension to the $badaddr before addressing the instruction page
fault and instruction access fault to workaround the issue "cip-453".

To avoid affecting the existing code sequence, this patch will creates two
trampolines to add sign extension to the $badaddr. By the "alternative"
mechanism, these two trampolines will replace the original exception
handler of instruction page fault and instruction access fault in the
excp_vect_table. In this case, only the specific SiFive CPU core jumps to
the do_page_fault and do_trap_insn_fault through these two trampolines.
Other CPUs are not affected.
