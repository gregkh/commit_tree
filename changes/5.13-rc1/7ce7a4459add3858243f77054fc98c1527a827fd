ACPICA: Add parsing for IVRS IVHD 40h and device entry F0h

ACPICA commit eefb865355514048380d921de5efcf30027d6b02

IVHD type 40h uses the same field layout as type 11h, but adds support
for a new device entry type F0h (ACPI HID device entry). The new device
entry type has variable length: after fixed-length fields occupying 22
bytes, there's a field of length up to 255 (as given by the preceding
field).
