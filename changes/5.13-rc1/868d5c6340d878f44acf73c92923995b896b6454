ASoC: tegra: Set driver name explicitly

The SoC sound core will generate a driver name by normalizing the card
name. However, most of the time that name does not tell anything about
the driver and is therefore useless for this purpose.

Make the driver name more useful by setting it explicitly during card
initialization.
