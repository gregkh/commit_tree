xfs: update lazy sb counters immediately for resizefs

sb_fdblocks will be updated lazily if lazysbcount is enabled,
therefore when shrinking the filesystem sb_fdblocks could be
larger than sb_dblocks and xfs_validate_sb_write() would fail.

Even for growfs case, it'd be better to update lazy sb counters
immediately to reflect the real sb counters.
