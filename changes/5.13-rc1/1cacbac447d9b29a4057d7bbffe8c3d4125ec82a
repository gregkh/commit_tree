ASoC: soc-pcm: don't use "name" on __soc_pcm_params_symmetry() macro

__soc_pcm_params_symmetry() macro is using "name" as parameter
which will be exchanged to rate/channles/sample_bit, like below

	dai->name => dai->rate
	dai->name => dai->channels
	dai->name => dai->sample_bit

But, dai itself has "name". This means

	1) It is very confusable naming
	2) It can't use dai->name

This patch use "xxx" instead of "name"
