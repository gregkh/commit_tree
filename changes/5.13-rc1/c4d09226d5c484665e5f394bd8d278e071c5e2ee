mfd: arizona: Make some symbols static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/mfd/arizona-spi.c:28:31: warning:
 symbol 'reset_gpios' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/mfd/arizona-spi.c:29:31: warning:
 symbol 'ldoena_gpios' was not declared. Should it be static?

Those symbols are not used outside of arizona-spi.c, so this
commit marks them static.
