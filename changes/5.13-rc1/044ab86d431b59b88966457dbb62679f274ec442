net: move the xps maps to an array

Move the xps maps (xps_cpus_map and xps_rxqs_map) to an array in
net_device. That will simplify a lot the code removing the need for lots
of if/else conditionals as the correct map will be available using its
offset in the array.

This should not modify the xps maps behaviour in any way.
