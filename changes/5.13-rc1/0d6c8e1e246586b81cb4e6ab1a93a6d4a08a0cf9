x86/platform/intel/quark: Fix incorrect kernel-doc comment syntax in files

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
There are certain files in arch/x86/platform/intel-quark, which follow this
syntax, but the content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.
Such lines were probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but are parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warnings from kernel-doc.

E.g., presence of kernel-doc like comment in the header lines for
arch/x86/platform/intel-quark/imr.c causes these warnings:
"warning: Function parameter or member 'fmt' not described in 'pr_fmt'"
"warning: expecting prototype for c(). Prototype was for pr_fmt() instead"

Similarly for arch/x86/platform/intel-quark/imr_selftest.c too.

Provide a simple fix by replacing these occurrences with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
