drm/i915: Simplify copying the FB view state to the plane state

Instead of copying separately the GTT remapped and color plane view info
from the FB to the plane state, do this by copying the whole
intel_fb_view struct. For this we make sure the FB view state is fully
inited (that is also including the view type) already during FB
creation, so this init is not required during atomic check time. This
also means the we don't need to reset the unused color plane info during
atomic check, as these are already reset during FB creation.

I noticed that initial FBs will only work atm if they are page aligned
(which BIOS most probably always ensures), but add a comment to sanitize
this part once. Also we won't disable the plane if
get_initial_plane_config() failed for some reason (for instance due to
unsupported rotation), add a TODO: comment for this too.
