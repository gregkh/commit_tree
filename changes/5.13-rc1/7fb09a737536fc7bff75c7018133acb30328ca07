ice: Modify recursive way of adding nodes

Remove the recursive way of adding the nodes to the layer in order
to reduce the stack usage. Instead the algorithm is modified to use
a while loop.

The previous code was scanning recursively the nodes horizontally.
The total stack consumption will be based on number of nodes present
on that layer. In some cases it can consume more stack.
