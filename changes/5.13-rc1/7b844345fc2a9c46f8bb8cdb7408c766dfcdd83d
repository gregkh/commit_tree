checkpatch: exclude four preprocessor sub-expressions from MACRO_ARG_REUSE

__must_be_array, offsetof, sizeof_field and __stringify are all
preprocessor macros and do not evaluate their arguments.  As such, it is
safe not to warn when arguments are being reused in those four
sub-expressions.

Exclude those so that they can pass checkpatch.
