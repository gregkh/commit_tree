fs: dlm: remove unaligned memory access handling

This patch removes unaligned memory access handling for receiving
midcomms messages. This handling will not fix the unaligned memory
access in general. All messages should be length aligned to 8 bytes,
there exists cases where this isn't the case. It's part of the sending
handling to not send such messages. As the sending handling itself, with
the internal allocator of page buffers, can occur in unaligned memory
access of dlm message fields we just ignore that problem for now as it
seems this code is used by architecture which can handle it.

This patch adds a comment to take care about that problem in a major
bump of dlm protocol.
