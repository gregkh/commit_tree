perf stat: Uniquify hybrid event name

It would be useful to let user know the pmu which the event belongs to.
perf-stat has supported '--no-merge' option and it can print the pmu
name after the event name, such as:

"cycles [cpu_core]"

Now this option is enabled by default for hybrid platform but change
the format to:

"cpu_core/cycles/"

If user configs the name, we still use the user specified name.
