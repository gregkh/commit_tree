drm/lima: add governor data with pre-defined thresholds

This patch adapts the panfrost pre-defined thresholds change [0] to the
lima driver to improve real-world performance. The upthreshold value has
been set to ramp GPU frequency to max freq faster (compared to panfrost)
to compensate for the lower overall performance of utgard devices.
