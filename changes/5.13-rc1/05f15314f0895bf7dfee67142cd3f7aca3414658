PM / devfreq: Remove the invalid description for get_target_freq

First of all, no_central_polling was removed since
commit 7e6fdd4bad03 ("PM / devfreq: Core updates to support devices
which can idle")
Secondly, get_target_freq() is not only called only with update_devfreq()
notified by OPP now, but also min/max freq qos notifier.

So remove this invalid description now to avoid confusing.
