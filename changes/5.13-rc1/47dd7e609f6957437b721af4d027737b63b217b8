net/mlx5: E-Switch, Use xarray for vport number to vport and rep mapping

Currently vport number to vport and its representor are mapped using an
array and an index.

Vport numbers of different types of functions are not contiguous. Adding
new such discontiguous range using index and number mapping is increasingly
complex and hard to maintain.

Hence, maintain an xarray of vport and rep whose lookup is done based on
the vport number.
Each VF and SF entry is marked with a xarray mark to identify the function
type. Additionally PF and VF needs special handling for legacy inline
mode. They are additionally marked as host function using additional
HOST_FN mark.
