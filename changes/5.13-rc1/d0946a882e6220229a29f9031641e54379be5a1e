perf/x86/intel: Hybrid PMU support for perf capabilities

Some platforms, e.g. Alder Lake, have hybrid architecture. Although most
PMU capabilities are the same, there are still some unique PMU
capabilities for different hybrid PMUs. Perf should register a dedicated
pmu for each hybrid PMU.

Add a new struct x86_hybrid_pmu, which saves the dedicated pmu and
capabilities for each hybrid PMU.

The architecture MSR, MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES, only indicates the
architecture features which are available on all hybrid PMUs. The
architecture features are stored in the global x86_pmu.intel_cap.

For Alder Lake, the model-specific features are perf metrics and
PEBS-via-PT. The corresponding bits of the global x86_pmu.intel_cap
should be 0 for these two features. Perf should not use the global
intel_cap to check the features on a hybrid system.
Add a dedicated intel_cap in the x86_hybrid_pmu to store the
model-specific capabilities. Use the dedicated intel_cap to replace
the global intel_cap for thse two features. The dedicated intel_cap
will be set in the following "Add Alder Lake Hybrid support" patch.

Add is_hybrid() to distinguish a hybrid system. ADL may have an
alternative configuration. With that configuration, the
X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU is not set. Perf cannot rely on the feature bit.
Add a new static_key_false, perf_is_hybrid, to indicate a hybrid system.
It will be assigned in the following "Add Alder Lake Hybrid support"
patch as well.
