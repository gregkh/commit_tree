arm64: dts: zynqmp: Remove si5328 device nodes

The function of_i2c_get_board_info will call of_modalias_node to check
if a device_node contains "compatible" string. But for the device si5328
at zcu102/zcu106 boards, there is no proper DT bindings for them. So remove
si5328 device nodes from dts files to eliminate the error info in the boot
message:

i2c i2c-10: of_i2c: modalias failure on /axi/i2c@ff030000/i2c-mux@74/i2c@4/clock-generator@69
i2c i2c-10: Failed to create I2C device for /axi/i2c@ff030000/i2c-mux@74/i2c@4/clock-generator@69
