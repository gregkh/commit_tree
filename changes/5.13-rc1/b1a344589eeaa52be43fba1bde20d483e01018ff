usb: mtu3: support ip-sleep wakeup for MT8183

Add support ip-sleep wakeup for MT8183, it's similar to MT8173,
and it's also a specific one, but not following IPM rule.
Due to the index 2 already used by many DTS, it's better to keep
it unchanged for backward compatibility, treat specific ones without
following IPM rule as revision 1.x, meanwhile reserve 3~10 for later
revision that follows the IPM rule.
