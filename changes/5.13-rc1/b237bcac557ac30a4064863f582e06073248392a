wdt: Support wdt on ROHM BD9576MUF and BD9573MUF

Add Watchdog support for ROHM BD9576MUF and BD9573MUF PMICs which are
mainly used to power the R-Car series processors. The watchdog is
pinged using a GPIO and enabled using another GPIO. Additionally
watchdog time-out can be configured to HW prior starting the watchdog.
Watchdog timeout can be configured to detect only delayed ping or in
a window mode where also too fast pings are detected.
