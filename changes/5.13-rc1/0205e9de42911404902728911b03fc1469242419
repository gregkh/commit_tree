libbpf: Avoid inline hint definition from 'linux/stddef.h'

Linux headers might pull 'linux/stddef.h' which defines
'__always_inline' as the following:

   #ifndef __always_inline
   #define __always_inline inline
   #endif

This becomes an issue if the program picks up the 'linux/stddef.h'
definition as the macro now just hints inline to clang.

This change now enforces the proper definition for BPF programs
regardless of the include order.
