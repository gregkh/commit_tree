KVM: selftests: Add a helper to get system default hugetlb page size

If HUGETLB is configured in the host kernel, then we can know the system
default hugetlb page size through *cat /proc/meminfo*. Otherwise, we will
not see the information of hugetlb pages in file /proc/meminfo if it's not
configured. So add a helper to determine whether HUGETLB is configured and
then get the default page size by reading /proc/meminfo.

This helper can be useful when a program wants to use the default hugetlb
pages of the system and doesn't know the default page size.
