drm/radeon: fix copy of uninitialized variable back to userspace

Currently the ioctl command RADEON_INFO_SI_BACKEND_ENABLED_MASK can
copy back uninitialised data in value_tmp that pointer *value points
to. This can occur when rdev->family is less than CHIP_BONAIRE and
less than CHIP_TAHITI.  Fix this by adding in a missing -EINVAL
so that no invalid value is copied back to userspace.
