mm: restore node stat checking in /proc/sys/vm/stat_refresh

In v4.7 commit 52b6f46bc163 ("mm: /proc/sys/vm/stat_refresh to force
vmstat update") introduced vmstat_refresh(), with its vmstat underflow
checking; then in v4.8 commit 75ef71840539 ("mm, vmstat: add
infrastructure for per-node vmstats") split NR_VM_NODE_STAT_ITEMS out of
NR_VM_ZONE_STAT_ITEMS without updating vmstat_refresh(): so it has been
missing out much of the vmstat underflow checking ever since.

Reinstate it.

Thanks to Roman Gushchin <guro@fb.com> for tangentially pointing this out.
