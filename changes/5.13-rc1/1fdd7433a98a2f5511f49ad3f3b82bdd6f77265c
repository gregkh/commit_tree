kbuild: add an elfnote for whether vmlinux is built with lto

Currently, clang LTO built vmlinux won't work with pahole.
LTO introduced cross-cu dwarf tag references and broke
current pahole model which handles one cu as a time.
The solution is to merge all cu's as one pahole cu as in [1].
We would like to do this merging only if cross-cu dwarf
references happens. The LTO build mode is a pretty good
indication for that.

In earlier version of this patch ([2]), clang flag
-grecord-gcc-switches is proposed to add to compilation flags
so pahole could detect "-flto" and then merging cu's.
This will increate the binary size of 1% without LTO though.

Arnaldo suggested to use a note to indicate the vmlinux
is built with LTO. Such a cheap way to get whether the vmlinux
is built with LTO or not helps pahole but is also useful
for tracing as LTO may inline/delete/demote global functions,
promote static functions, etc.

So this patch added an elfnote with a new type LINUX_ELFNOTE_LTO_INFO.
The owner of the note is "Linux".

With gcc 8.4.1 and clang trunk, without LTO, I got
  $ readelf -n vmlinux
  Displaying notes found in: .notes
    Owner                Data size        Description
  ...
    Linux                0x00000004       func
     description data: 00 00 00 00
  ...
With "readelf -x ".notes" vmlinux", I can verify the above "func"
with type code 0x101.

With clang thin-LTO, I got the same as above except the following:
     description data: 01 00 00 00
which indicates the vmlinux is built with LTO.
