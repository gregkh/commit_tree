fs: split receive_fd_replace from __receive_fd

receive_fd_replace shares almost no code with the general case, so split
it out.  Also remove the "Bump the sock usage counts" comment from
both copies, as that is now what __receive_sock actually does.

[AV: ... and make the only user of receive_fd_replace() choose between
it and receive_fd() according to what userland had passed to it in
flags]
