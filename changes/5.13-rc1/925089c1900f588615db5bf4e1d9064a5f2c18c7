bus: mhi: core: Destroy SBL devices when moving to mission mode

Currently, client devices are created in SBL or AMSS (mission
mode) and only destroyed after power down or SYS ERROR. When
moving between certain execution environments, such as from SBL
to AMSS, no clean-up is required. This presents an issue where
SBL-specific channels are left open and client drivers now run in
an execution environment where they cannot operate. Fix this by
expanding the mhi_destroy_device() to do an execution environment
specific clean-up if one is requested. Close the gap and destroy
devices in such scenarios that allow SBL client drivers to clean
up once device enters mission mode.
