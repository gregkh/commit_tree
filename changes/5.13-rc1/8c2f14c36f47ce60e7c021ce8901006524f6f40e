drm/amd/display: Add changes for dsc bpp in 16ths and unify bw calculations

[Why?]
Some code still expected bpp to be used in whole bits, not 16ths.  dsc.c uses
redundant function now found in dc to calculate stream bandwidth from timing.

[How?]
Fix code to work with 16ths instead of whole bits for dsc bpp.
Refactor get_dsc_bandwidth to accept inputs in 16ths of a bit.
Use dc function to calculate bandwidth from timing, and make dsc bw calculation
a part of dsc.c.
