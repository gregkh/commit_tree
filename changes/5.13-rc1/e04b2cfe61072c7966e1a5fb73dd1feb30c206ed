can: m_can: m_can_tx_work_queue(): fix tx_skb race condition

The m_can_start_xmit() function checks if the cdev->tx_skb is NULL and
returns with NETDEV_TX_BUSY in case tx_sbk is not NULL.

There is a race condition in the m_can_tx_work_queue(), where first
the skb is send to the driver and then the case tx_sbk is set to NULL.
A TX complete IRQ might come in between and wake the queue, which
results in tx_skb not being cleared yet.
