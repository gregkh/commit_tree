io_uring: track inflight requests through counter

Instead of keeping requests in a inflight_list, just track them with a
per tctx atomic counter. Apart from it being much easier and more
consistent with task cancel, it frees ->inflight_entry from being shared
between iopoll and cancel-track, so less headache for us.
