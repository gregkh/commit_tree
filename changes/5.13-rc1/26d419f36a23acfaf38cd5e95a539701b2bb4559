staging: dpaa2-switch: get control interface attributes

Introduce a new structure to hold all necessary info related to an RX
queue for the control interface and populate the FQ IDs.
We only have one Rx queue and one Tx confirmation queue on the control
interface, both shared by all the switch ports.

Also, increase the minimum version of the object supported by the driver
since for a basic switch driver support we'll be in need for some ABIs
added in the latest version of firmware.
