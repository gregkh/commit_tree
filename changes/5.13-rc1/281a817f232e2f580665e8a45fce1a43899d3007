scsi: smartpqi: Refactor aio submission code

Refactor aio submission code:

    1. Break up function pqi_raid_bypass_submit_scsi_cmd()
       into smaller functions.

    2. Add common block (rmd - raid_map_data) to carry around into newly
       added functions.

    3. Prepare for new AIO functionality.

No functional changes.
