tracing: Unify the logic for function tracing options

Currently the logic for dealing with the options for function tracing
has two different implementations. One is used when we set the flags
(in "static int func_set_flag()") and another used when we initialize
the tracer (in "static int function_trace_init()"). Those two
implementations are meant to do essentially the same thing and they
are both not very convenient for adding new options. In this patch
we add a helper function that provides a single implementation of
the logic for dealing with the options and we make it such that new
options can be easily added.
