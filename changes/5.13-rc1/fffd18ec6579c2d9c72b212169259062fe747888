scsi: lpfc: Fix crash when a REG_RPI mailbox fails triggering a LOGO response

Fix a crash caused by a double put on the node when the driver completed an
ACC for an unsolicted abort on the same node.  The second put was executed
by lpfc_nlp_not_used() and is wrong because the completion routine executes
the nlp_put when the iocbq was released.  Additionally, the driver is
issuing a LOGO then immediately calls lpfc_nlp_set_state to put the node
into NPR.  This call does nothing.

Remove the lpfc_nlp_not_used call and additional set_state in the
completion routine.  Remove the lpfc_nlp_set_state post issue_logo.  Isn't
necessary.
