powerpc/32: Save remaining registers in exception prolog

Save non volatile registers, XER, CTR, MSR and NIP in exception prolog.

Also assign proper value to r2 and r3 there.

For now, recalculate thread pointer in prepare_transfer_to_handler.
It will disappear once KUAP is ported to C.

And remove the comment which is now completely wrong.
