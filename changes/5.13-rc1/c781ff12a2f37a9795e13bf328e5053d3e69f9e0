ethtool: Allow network drivers to dump arbitrary EEPROM data

Define get_module_eeprom_by_page() ethtool callback and implement
netlink infrastructure.

get_module_eeprom_by_page() allows network drivers to dump a part of
module's EEPROM specified by page and bank numbers along with offset and
length. It is effectively a netlink replacement for get_module_info()
and get_module_eeprom() pair, which is needed due to emergence of
complex non-linear EEPROM layouts.
