He/She did not maintain zh_CN translations for a long time.
<xiyoulinuxkernelgroup@googlegroups.com> is a maillist for Linux group of
Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, not special for zh_CN
translation work.

Anyway, many thanks him/her and Xiyou for their contributions to the early
Chinese translation work!
