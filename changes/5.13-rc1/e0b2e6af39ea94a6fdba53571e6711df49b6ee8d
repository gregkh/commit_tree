arm64: dts: ti: k3-j7200: Add gpio nodes

There are 4 instances of gpio modules in main domain:
	gpio0, gpio2, gpio4 and gpio6

Groups are created to provide protection between different processor
virtual worlds. Each of these modules I/O pins are muxed within the
group. Exactly one module can be selected to control the corresponding
pin by selecting it in the pad mux configuration registers.

This group in main domain pins out 69 lines (5 banks). Add DT modes for
each module instance in the main domain.

Similar to the gpio groups in main domain, there is one gpio group in
wakeup domain with 2 module instances in it.

The gpio group pins out 72 pins (6 banks) of the first 85 gpio lines. Add
DT nodes for each module instance in the wakeup domain.
