lsm,selinux: add new hook to compare new mount to an existing mount

Add a new hook that takes an existing super block and a new mount
with new options and determines if new options confict with an
existing mount or not.

A filesystem can use this new hook to determine if it can share
the an existing superblock with a new superblock for the new mount.
