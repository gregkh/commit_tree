to count events according to tt_req or tt_core set in L3C PMU.

* datasrc_skt: it is the abbreviation of data source from another
socket and it is used in the multi-chips. It's the same as L3C PMU.

statistics that come from the specific CCL/ICL by the configuration.
These are the abbreviation of source ID command and mask. The source
