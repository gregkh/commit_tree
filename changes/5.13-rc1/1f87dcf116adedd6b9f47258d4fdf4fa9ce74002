selftests/bpf: Add non-BPF_LSM test for task local storage

Task local storage is enabled for tracing programs. Add two tests for
task local storage without CONFIG_BPF_LSM.

The first test stores a value in sys_enter and read it back in sys_exit.

The second test checks whether the kernel allows allocating task local
storage in exit_creds() (which it should not).
