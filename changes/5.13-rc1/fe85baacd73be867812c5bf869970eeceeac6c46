ARM: dts: Configure interconnect target module for omap4 dmm

We can now probe devices with device tree only configuration using
ti-sysc interconnect target module driver. Let's configure the
module, but keep the legacy "ti,hwmods" property to avoid new boot
time warnings. The legacy property will be removed in later patches
together with the legacy platform data.

Let's also use GIC_SPI and IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH defines while at it.
