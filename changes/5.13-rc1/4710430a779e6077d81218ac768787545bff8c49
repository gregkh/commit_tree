drm/amd/display: DCHUB underflow counter increasing in some scenarios

[Why]
When unplugging a display, the underflow counter can be seen to
increase because PSTATE switch is allowed even when some planes are not
blanked.

[How]
Check that all planes are not active instead of all streams before
allowing PSTATE change.
