spi: stm32-qspi: fix debug format string

Printing size_t needs a special %zx format modifier to avoid a
warning like:

drivers/spi/spi-stm32-qspi.c:481:41: note: format string is defined here
  481 |         dev_dbg(qspi->dev, "%s len = 0x%x offs = 0x%llx buf = 0x%p\n", __func__, len, offs, buf);

Patrice already tried to fix this, but picked %lx instead of %zx,
which fixed some architectures but broke others in the same way.
Using %zx works everywhere.
