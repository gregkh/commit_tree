mm/filemap: drop check for truncated page after I/O

If the I/O completed successfully, the page will remain Uptodate, even
if it is subsequently truncated.  If the I/O completed with an error,
this check would cause us to retry the I/O if the page were truncated
before we woke up.  There is no need to retry the I/O; the I/O to fill
the page failed, so we can legitimately just return -EIO.

This code was originally added by commit 56f0d5fe6851 ("[PATCH]
readpage-vs-invalidate fix") in 2005 (this commit ID is from the
linux-fullhistory tree; it is also commit ba1f08f14b52 in tglx-history).

At the time, truncate_complete_page() called ClearPageUptodate(), and so
this was fixing a real bug.  In 2008, commit 84209e02de48 ("mm: dont clear
PG_uptodate on truncate/invalidate") removed the call to
ClearPageUptodate, and this check has been unnecessary ever since.

It doesn't do any real harm, but there's no need to keep it.
