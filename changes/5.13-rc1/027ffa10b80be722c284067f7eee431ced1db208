staging: rtl8723bs: remove sdio_drv_priv structure

The sdio_drv_priv structure is a small wrapper around sdio_driver in
linux/mmc/sdio_func.h with an added drv_registered integer.

drv_registered is never used anywhere in the driver and only assigned to
during the sdio registering and unregistering process. We can safely
remove sdio_drv_priv and use the sdio_driver structure directly.
