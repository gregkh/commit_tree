media: staging: atomisp: Removed else branch in function

This patch fixes the checkpatch.pl warning :

WARNING: else is not generally useful after a break or return

Expressions under 'else' branch in function 'gc0310_s_power' are
executed whenever the exppression in 'if' is False. Otherwise, return
from function occurs. Therefore, there is no need in 'else', and it has
been removed.
