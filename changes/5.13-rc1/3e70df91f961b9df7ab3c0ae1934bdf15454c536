rcu: deprecate "all" option to rcu_nocbs=

With the core bitmap support now accepting "N" as a placeholder for
the end of the bitmap, "all" can be represented as "0-N" and has the
advantage of not being specific to RCU (or any other subsystem).

So deprecate the use of "all" by removing documentation references
to it.  The support itself needs to remain for now, since we don't
know how many people out there are using it currently, but since it
is in an __init area anyway, it isn't worth losing sleep over.
