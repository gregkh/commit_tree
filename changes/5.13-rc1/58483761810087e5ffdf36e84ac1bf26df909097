thermal/drivers/core: Use a char pointer for the cooling device name

We want to have any kind of name for the cooling devices as we do no
longer want to rely on auto-numbering. Let's replace the cooling
device's fixed array by a char pointer to be allocated dynamically
when registering the cooling device, so we don't limit the length of
the name.

Rework the error path at the same time as we have to rollback the
allocations in case of error.

Tested with a dummy device having the name:
 "Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch"

A village on the island of Anglesey (Wales), known to have the longest
name in Europe.
