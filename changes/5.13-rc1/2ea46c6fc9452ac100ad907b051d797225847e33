cpumask/hotplug: Fix cpu_dying() state tracking

Vincent reported that for states with a NULL startup/teardown function
we do not call cpuhp_invoke_callback() (because there is none) and as
such we'll not update the cpu_dying() state.

The stale cpu_dying() can eventually lead to triggering BUG().

Rectify this by updating cpu_dying() in the exact same places the
hotplug machinery tracks its directional state, namely
cpuhp_set_state() and cpuhp_reset_state().
