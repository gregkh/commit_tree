vfio/pci: Move VGA and VF initialization to functions

vfio_pci_probe() is quite complicated, with optional VF and VGA sub
components. Move these into clear init/uninit functions and have a linear
flow in probe/remove.

This fixes a few little buglets:
 - vfio_pci_remove() is in the wrong order, vga_client_register() removes
   a notifier and is after kfree(vdev), but the notifier refers to vdev,
   so it can use after free in a race.
 - vga_client_register() can fail but was ignored

Organize things so destruction order is the reverse of creation order.
