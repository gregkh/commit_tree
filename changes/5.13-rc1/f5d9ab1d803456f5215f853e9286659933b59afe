ACPI: scan: Drop sta argument from acpi_init_device_object()

Use the observation that the initial status check for
ACPI_BUS_TYPE_PROCESSOR objects can be carried out in the same way
as for ACPI_BUS_TYPE_DEVICE objects and it is not necessary to fail
acpi_add_single_object() if acpi_bus_get_status_handle() returns an
error for a processor (its status can be set to 0 instead) to
simplify acpi_add_single_object().

Accordingly, drop the "sta" argument from acpi_init_device_object()
as it can always set the initial status to ACPI_STA_DEFAULT and let
its caller correct that later on.
