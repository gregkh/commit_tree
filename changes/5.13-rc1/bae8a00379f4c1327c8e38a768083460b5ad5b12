bnxt_en: Remove the read of BNXT_FW_RESET_INPROG_REG after firmware reset.

Once the chip goes through reset, the register mapping may be lost
and any read of the mapped health registers may return garbage value
until the registers are mapped again in the init path.

Reading BNXT_FW_RESET_INPROG_REG after firmware reset will likely
return garbage value due to the above reason.  Reading this register
is for information purpose only so remove it.
