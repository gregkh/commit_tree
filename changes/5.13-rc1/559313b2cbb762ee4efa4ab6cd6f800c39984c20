mlxsw: spectrum_matchall: Push sampling checks to per-ASIC operations

Push some sampling checks to the per-ASIC operations, as they are no
longer relevant for all ASICs.

The sampling rate validation against the MPSC maximum rate is only
relevant for Spectrum-1, as Spectrum-2 and later ASICs no longer use
MPSC register for sampling.

The ingress / egress validation is pushed down to the per-ASIC
operations since subsequent patches are going to remove it for
Spectrum-2 and later ASICs.
