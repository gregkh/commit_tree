x86/kprobes: Retrieve correct opcode for group instruction

Since the opcodes start from 0xff are group5 instruction group which is
not 2 bytes opcode but the extended opcode determined by the MOD/RM byte.

The commit abd82e533d88 ("x86/kprobes: Do not decode opcode in resume_execution()")
used insn->opcode.bytes[1], but that is not correct. We have to refer
the insn->modrm.bytes[1] instead.
