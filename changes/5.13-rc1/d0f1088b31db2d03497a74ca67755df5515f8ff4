coredump: don't bother with do_truncate()

have dump_skip() just remember how much needs to be skipped,
leave actual seeks/writing zeroes to the next dump_emit()
or the end of coredump output, whichever comes first.
And instead of playing with do_truncate() in the end, just
write one NUL at the end of the last gap (if any).
