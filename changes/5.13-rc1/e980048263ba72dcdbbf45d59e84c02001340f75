spi: orion: set devdata properly as it is being used later

If device_get_match_data returns NULL, devdata isn't being updated
properly. It is being used later in the function. Both devdata and
spi->devdata should be updated to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

Addresses-Coverity: ("NULL pointer dereference")
Fixes: 0e6521f13c2 ("spi: orion: Use device_get_match_data() helper")
