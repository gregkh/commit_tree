KVM: Move MMU notifier's mmu_lock acquisition into common helper

Acquire and release mmu_lock in the __kvm_handle_hva_range() helper
instead of requiring the caller to do the same.  This paves the way for
future patches to take mmu_lock if and only if an overlapping memslot is
found, without also having to introduce the on_lock() shenanigans used
to manipulate the notifier count and sequence.

No functional change intended.
