ata: ahci: Disable SXS for Hisilicon Kunpeng920

On Hisilicon Kunpeng920, ESP is set to 1 by default for all ports of
SATA controller. In some scenarios, some ports are not external SATA ports,
and it cause disks connected to these ports to be identified as removable
disks. So disable the SXS capability on the software side to prevent users
from mistakenly considering non-removable disks as removable disks and
performing related operations.
