scsi: lpfc: Fix illegal memory access on Abort IOCBs

In devloss timer handler and in backend calls to terminate remote port I/O,
there is logic to walk through all active IOCBs and validate them to
potentially trigger an abort request. This logic is causing illegal memory
accesses which leads to a crash. Abort IOCBs, which may be on the list, do
not have an associated lpfc_io_buf struct. The driver is trying to map an
lpfc_io_buf struct on the IOCB and which results in a bogus address thus
the issue.

Fix by skipping over ABORT IOCBs (CLOSE IOCBs are ABORTS that don't send
ABTS) in the IOCB scan logic.
