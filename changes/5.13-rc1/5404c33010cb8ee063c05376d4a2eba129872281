erofs: add big physical cluster definition

Big pcluster indicates the size of compressed data for each physical
pcluster is no longer fixed as block size, but could be more than 1
block (more accurately, 1 logical pcluster)

When big pcluster feature is enabled for head0/1, delta0 of the 1st
non-head lcluster index will keep block count of this pcluster in
lcluster size instead of 1. Or, the compressed size of pcluster
should be 1 lcluster if pcluster has no non-head lcluster index.

Also note that BIG_PCLUSTER feature reuses COMPR_CFGS feature since
it depends on COMPR_CFGS and will be released together.
