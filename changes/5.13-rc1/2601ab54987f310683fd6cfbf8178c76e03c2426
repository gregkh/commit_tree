dt-bindings: Convert the BCM4329 bindings to YAML and extend

This converts the BCM4329 family bindings to YAML schema, and
extends and fixes the bindings like this:

- Name the bindings after the first chip (BCM4329) since
  wildcards like 43xx are nowadays frowned upon by the DT
  binding reviewers. We call this the "BCM4329 family"
- Add compatible strings for all the variants that seem to
  exist in the wild. (Derived from firmware listings.)
- Support specific-to-generic compatible strings (as already
  in use in DTS files).
- Add required reg property (SDIO function number)
- Add reset-gpios property (some systems wire this to a GPIO
  line).
- I have only listed Arend as maintainer for now, volunteers
  can be added.
