KVM: x86/mmu: Tear down roots before kvm_mmu_zap_all_fast returns

To avoid saddling a vCPU thread with the work of tearing down an entire
paging structure, take a reference on each root before they become
obsolete, so that the thread initiating the fast invalidation can tear
down the paging structure and (most likely) release the last reference.
As a bonus, this teardown can happen under the MMU lock in read mode so
as not to block the progress of vCPU threads.
