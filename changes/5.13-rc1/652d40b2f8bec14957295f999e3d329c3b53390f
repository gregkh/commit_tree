s390/pci: fix DMA cleanup on hard deconfigure

In commit dee60c0dbc83 ("s390/pci: add zpci_event_hard_deconfigured()")
we added a zdev_enabled() check to what was previously an uncoditional
call to zpci_disable_device(). There are two problems with that. Firstly
zpci_had_deconfigured() is only called on event 0x0304 for which the
device is always already disabled by the platform so it is always false.
Secondly zpci_disable_device() not only disables the device but also
calls zpci_dma_exit_device() which is thus not called and we leak the
DMA tables.

Fix this by calling zpci_disable_device() unconditionally to perform
Linux side cleanup including the freeing of DMA tables.
