USB:ehci:fix Kunpeng920 ehci hardware problem

Kunpeng920's EHCI controller does not have SBRN register.
Reading the SBRN register when the controller driver is
initialized will get 0.

When rebooting the EHCI driver, ehci_shutdown() will be called.
if the sbrn flag is 0, ehci_shutdown() will return directly.
The sbrn flag being 0 will cause the EHCI interrupt signal to
not be turned off after reboot. this interrupt that is not closed
will cause an exception to the device sharing the interrupt.

Therefore, the EHCI controller of Kunpeng920 needs to skip
the read operation of the SBRN register.
