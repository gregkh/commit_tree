media: imx-jpeg: Add V4L2 driver for i.MX8 JPEG Encoder/Decoder

V4L2 driver for the JPEG encoder/decoder from i.MX8QXP/i.MX8QM application
processors.
The multi-planar buffers API is used.

Baseline and extended sequential jpeg decoding is supported.
Progressive jpeg decoding is not supported by the IP.
Supports encode and decode of various formats:
     YUV444, YUV422, YUV420, RGB, ARGB, Gray
YUV420 is the only multi-planar format supported.
Minimum resolution is 64 x 64, maximum 8192 x 8192.
The alignment requirements for the resolution depend on the format,
multiple of 16 resolutions should work for all formats.

v4l2-compliance tests are passing, including the
streaming tests, "v4l2-compliance -s"
