KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Fix error handling in vgic_v3_set_redist_base()

vgic_v3_insert_redist_region() may succeed while
vgic_register_all_redist_iodevs fails. For example this happens
while adding a redistributor region overlapping a dist region. The
failure only is detected on vgic_register_all_redist_iodevs when
vgic_v3_check_base() gets called in vgic_register_redist_iodev().

In such a case, remove the newly added redistributor region and free
it.
