i2c: sprd: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
return in sprd_i2c_master_xfer() and sprd_i2c_remove().

However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference
count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result
in a reference leak here.

Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
counter balanced.
