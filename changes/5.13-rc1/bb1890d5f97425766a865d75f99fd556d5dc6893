net: hns3: change flr_prepare/flr_done function names

The flr_prepare/flr_done functions are not only used in the FLR scenario,
but also used in the suspend/resume.

Change the function names to prepare_for_reset/rebuild_for_reset, change
the flr_prepare/flr_done to reset_prepare/reset_done in hnae3_ae_ops.
