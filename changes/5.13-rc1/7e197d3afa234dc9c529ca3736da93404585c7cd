staging: rtl8723bs: remove rx_logs/tx_logs/int_logs from drv_types.h

Remove the rx_logs/tx_logs/int_logs struct definitions and their
inclusion within struct adapter as fields, from include/drv_types.h.
They were conditionally compiled based on CONFIG_DBG_COUNTER which
now has no other users in the driver, and were only ever accessed
in a write only fashion via the DBG_COUNTER macro, which has also
been removed.
