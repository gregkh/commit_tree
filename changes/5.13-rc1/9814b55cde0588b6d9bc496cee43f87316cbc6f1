scsi: target: tcmu: Return from tcmu_handle_completions() if cmd_id not found

If tcmu_handle_completions() finds an invalid cmd_id while looping over cmd
responses from userspace it sets TCMU_DEV_BIT_BROKEN and breaks the
loop. This means that it does further handling for the tcmu device.

Skip that handling by replacing 'break' with 'return'.

Additionally change tcmu_handle_completions() from unsigned int to bool,
since the value used in return already is bool.
