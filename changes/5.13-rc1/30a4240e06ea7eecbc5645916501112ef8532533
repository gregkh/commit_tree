crypto: hisilicon/zip - adjust functions location

This patch changes nothing about functions except location in order to make
code logic clearly.

This adjustment follows three principles:
1.The called functions are listed in order above the calling functions.
2.The paired functions are next to each other.
3.Logically similar functions are placed in the same area. Here, we use
the callback of 'acomp_alg' as the basis for dividing areas.
