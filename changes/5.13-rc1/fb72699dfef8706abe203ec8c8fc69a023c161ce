net: hns3: refactor for function hclge_fd_convert_tuple

Currently, there are too many branches for hclge_fd_convert_tuple().
And it may be more when add new tuples. Refactor it by sorting the
tuples according to their length. So it only needs several KEY_OPT
now, and being flexible to add new tuples.
