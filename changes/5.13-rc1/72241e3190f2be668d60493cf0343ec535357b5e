regulator: core.c: Improve a comment

s/regulator may on/regulator may already be enabled/
s/or left on/or was left on/

The aim of this patch is to make the comment more readable and to make
it clear, that this is about a regulator, that is already enabled instead
of a regulator that may be switched on.
