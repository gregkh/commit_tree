bus: ti-sysc: Fix initializing module_pa for modules without sysc register

We have interconnect target modules with no known registers using only
clocks and resets, but we still want to detect them based on the module
IO range. So let's call sysc_parse_and_check_child_range() earlier so we
have module_pa properly initialized.
