iio: hrtimer-trigger: Fix potential integer overflow in iio_hrtimer_store_sampling_frequency

Add suffix ULL to constant 1000 in order to avoid a potential integer
overflow and give the compiler complete information about the proper
arithmetic to use. Notice that this constant is being used in a context
that expects an expression of type unsigned long long, but it's
currently evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.
