platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Add requirements file to debugfs

Add the debugfs file, substate_requirements, to view the low power mode
(LPM) requirements for each enabled mode alongside the last latched status
of the condition.

After this patch, the new file will look like this:

                    Element |    S0i2.0 |    S0i3.0 |    S0i2.1 |    S0i3.1 |    S0i3.2 |    Status |
