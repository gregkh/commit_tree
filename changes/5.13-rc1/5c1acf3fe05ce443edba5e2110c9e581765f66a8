cifs: fix regression when mounting shares with prefix paths

The commit 315db9a05b7a ("cifs: fix leak in cifs_smb3_do_mount() ctx")
revealed an existing bug when mounting shares that contain a prefix
path or DFS links.

cifs_setup_volume_info() requires the @devname to contain the full
path (UNC + prefix) to update the fs context with the new UNC and
prepath values, however we were passing only the UNC
path (old_ctx->UNC) in @device thus discarding any prefix paths.

Instead of concatenating both old_ctx->{UNC,prepath} and pass it in
@devname, just keep the dup'ed values of UNC and prepath in
cifs_sb->ctx after calling smb3_fs_context_dup(), and fix
smb3_parse_devname() to correctly parse and not leak the new UNC and
prefix paths.
