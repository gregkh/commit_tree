mailbox: sprd: Introduce refcnt when clients requests/free channels

Unisoc mailbox has no way to be enabled/disabled for any single channel.
They can only be set to startup or shutdown as a whole device at same time.

Add a variable to count references to avoid mailbox FIFO being reset
unexpectedly when clients are requesting or freeing channels.

Also add a lock to dismiss possible conflicts from register r/w in
different startup or shutdown threads. And fix the crash problem when early
interrupts come from channel which has not been requested by client yet.
