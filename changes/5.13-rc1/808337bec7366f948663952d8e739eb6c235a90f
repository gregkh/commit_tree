net: tun: Remove redundant assignment to ret

Variable 'ret' is set to zero but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/net/tun.c:3008:2: warning: Value stored to 'ret' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
