xhci: prevent double-fetch of transfer and transfer event TRBs

The same values are parsed several times from transfer and event
TRBs by different functions in the same call path, all while processing
one transfer event.

As the TRBs are in DMA memory and can be accessed by the xHC host we want
to avoid this to prevent double-fetch issues.

To resolve this pass the already parsed values to the different functions
in the path of parsing a transfer event
