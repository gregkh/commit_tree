brd: expose number of allocated pages in debugfs

While the maximum size of each ramdisk is defined either as a module
parameter, or compile time default, it's impossible to know how many pages
have currently been allocated by each ram%d device, since they're
allocated when used and never freed.

This patch creates a new directory at this location:

/sys/kernel/debug/ramdisk_pages/

which will contain a file named "ram%d" for each instantiated ramdisk on
the system. The file is read-only, and read() will output the number of
pages currently held by that ramdisk.

We lose track how much memory a ramdisk is using as pages once used are
simply recycled but never freed.

In instances where we exhaust the size of the ramdisk with a file that
exceeds it, encounter ENOSPC and delete the file for mitigation; df would
show decrease in used and increase in available blocks but the since we
have touched all pages, the memory footprint of the ramdisk does not
reflect the blocks used/available count

This debugfs counter will always reveal the accurate number of
permanently allocated pages to the ramdisk.
