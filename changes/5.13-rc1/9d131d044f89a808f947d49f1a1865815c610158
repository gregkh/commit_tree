net: qualcomm: rmnet: kill RMNET_MAP_GET_*() accessor macros

The following macros, defined in "rmnet_map.h", assume a socket
buffer is provided as an argument without any real indication this
is the case.
    RMNET_MAP_GET_MUX_ID()
    RMNET_MAP_GET_CD_BIT()
    RMNET_MAP_GET_PAD()
    RMNET_MAP_GET_CMD_START()
    RMNET_MAP_GET_LENGTH()
What they hide is pretty trivial accessing of fields in a structure,
and it's much clearer to see this if we do these accesses directly.

So rather than using these accessor macros, assign a local
variable of the map header pointer type to the socket buffer data
pointer, and derereference that pointer variable.

In "rmnet_map_data.c", use sizeof(object) rather than sizeof(type)
in one spot.  Also, there's no need to byte swap 0; it's all zeros
irrespective of endianness.
