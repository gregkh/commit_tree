ACPI: custom_method: fix a possible memory leak

In cm_write(), if the 'buf' is allocated memory but not fully consumed,
it is possible to reallocate the buffer without freeing it by passing
'*ppos' as 0 on a subsequent call.

Add an explicit kfree() before kzalloc() to prevent the possible memory
leak.
