x86/platform/uv: Fix !KEXEC build failure

When KEXEC is disabled, the UV build fails:

  arch/x86/platform/uv/uv_nmi.c:875:14: error: ‘uv_nmi_kexec_failed’ undeclared (first use in this function)

Since uv_nmi_kexec_failed is only defined in the KEXEC_CORE #ifdef branch,
this code cannot ever have been build tested:

	if (main)
		pr_err("UV: NMI kdump: KEXEC not supported in this kernel\n");
	atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 1);

Nor is this use possible in uv_handle_nmi():

                atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 0);

These bugs were introduced in this commit:

    d0a9964e9873: ("x86/platform/uv: Implement simple dump failover if kdump fails")

Which added the uv_nmi_kexec_failed assignments to !KEXEC code, while making the
definition KEXEC-only - apparently without testing the !KEXEC case.

Instead of complicating the #ifdef maze, simplify the code by requiring X86_UV
to depend on KEXEC_CORE. This pattern is present in other architectures as well.

( We'll remove the untested, 7 years old !KEXEC complications from the file in a
  separate commit. )
