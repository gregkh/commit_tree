torture: Abstract jitter.sh start/stop into scripts

This commit creates jitterstart.sh and jitterstop.sh scripts that handle
the starting and stopping of the jitter.sh scripts.  These must be sourced
using the bash "." command to allow the generated script to wait on the
backgrounded jitter.sh scripts.
