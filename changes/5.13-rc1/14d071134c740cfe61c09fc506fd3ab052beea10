Revert "mremap: don't allow MREMAP_DONTUNMAP on special_mappings and aio"

This reverts commit cd544fd1dc9293c6702fab6effa63dac1cc67e99.

As discussed in [1] this commit was a no-op because the mapping type was
checked in vma_to_resize before move_vma is ever called.  This meant that
vm_ops->mremap() would never be called on such mappings.  Furthermore,
we've since expanded support of MREMAP_DONTUNMAP to non-anonymous
mappings, and these special mappings are still protected by the existing
check of !VM_DONTEXPAND and !VM_PFNMAP which will result in a -EINVAL.
