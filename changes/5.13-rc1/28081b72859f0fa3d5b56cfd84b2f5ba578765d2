phy: cadence: Sierra: Model PLL_CMNLC and PLL_CMNLC1 as clocks (mux clocks)

Sierra has two PLLs, PLL_CMNLC and PLL_CMNLC1 and each of these PLLs has
two inputs, plllc_refclk (input from pll0_refclk) and refrcv (input from
pll1_refclk). Model PLL_CMNLC and PLL_CMNLC1 as clocks so that it's
possible to select one of these two inputs from device tree.
