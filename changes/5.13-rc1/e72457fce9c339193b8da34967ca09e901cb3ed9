platform/x86: intel-hid: Fix spurious wakeups caused by tablet-mode events during suspend

Some devices send (duplicate) tablet-mode events when moved around even
though the mode has not changed; and they do this even when suspended.

Change the tablet-mode event handling when priv->wakeup_mode is set to
update the switch state in case it changed and then return immediately
(without calling pm_wakeup_hard_event()) to avoid spurious wakeups.
