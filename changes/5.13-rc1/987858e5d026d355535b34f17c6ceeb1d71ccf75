mptcp: ignore unsupported msg flags

Currently mptcp_sendmsg() fails with EOPNOTSUPP if the
user-space provides some unsupported flag. That is unexpected
and may foul existing applications migrated to MPTCP, which
expect a different behavior.

Change the mentioned function to silently ignore the unsupported
flags except MSG_FASTOPEN. This is the only flags currently not
supported by MPTCP with user-space visible side-effects.
