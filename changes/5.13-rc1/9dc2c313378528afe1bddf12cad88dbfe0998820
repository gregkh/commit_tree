gro: consistentify napi->gro_hash[x] access in dev_gro_receive()

GRO bucket index doesn't change through the entire function.
Store a pointer to the corresponding bucket instead of its member
and use it consistently through the function.
It is performance-safe since &gro_list->list == gro_list.

Misc: remove superfluous braces around single-line branches.
