vfio/mdev: Make to_mdev_device() into a static inline

The macro wrongly uses 'dev' as both the macro argument and the member
name, which means it fails compilation if any caller uses a word other
than 'dev' as the single argument. Fix this defect by making it into
proper static inline, which is more clear and typesafe anyhow.
