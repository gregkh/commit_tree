iwlwifi: mvm: Add support for 6GHz passive scan

When doing scan while 6GHz channels are not enabled, the 6GHz band
is not scanned. Thus, if there are no APs on the 2GHz and 5GHz bands
(that will allow discovery of geographic location etc. that would
allow enabling the 6GHz channels) but there are non collocated APs
on 6GHz PSC channels these would never be discovered.

To overcome this, FW added support for performing passive UHB scan
in case no APs were discovered during scan on the 2GHz and 5GHz
channels.

Add support for enabling such scan when the following conditions are
met:

- 6GHz channels are supported but not enabled by regulatory.
- Station interface is not associated or less than a defined time
  interval passed from the last resume or HW reset flows.
- At least 4 channels are included in the scan request
- The scan request includes the widlcard SSID.
- At least 50 minutes passed from the last 6GHz passive scan.
