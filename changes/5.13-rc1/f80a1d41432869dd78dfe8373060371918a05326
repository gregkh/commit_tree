interconnect: qcom: Add SDM660 interconnect provider driver

Introduce a driver for the Qualcomm interconnect busses found in
the SDM630/SDM636/SDM660 SoCs.
The topology consists of several NoCs that are controlled by a
remote processor that collects the aggregated bandwidth for each
master-slave pairs.

On a note, these chips are managing the "bus QoS" in a "hybrid"
fashion: some of the paths in the topology are managed through
(and by, of course) the RPM uC, while some others are "AP Owned",
meaning that the AP shall do direct writes to the appropriate
QoS registers for the specific paths and ports, instead of sending
an indication to the RPM and leaving the job to that one.
