perf cs-etm: Fix bitmap for option

When set option with macros ETM_OPT_CTXTID and ETM_OPT_TS, it wrongly
takes these two values (14 and 28 prespectively) as bit masks, but
actually both are the offset for bits.  But this doesn't lead to further
failure due to the AND logic operation will be always true for
ETM_OPT_CTXTID / ETM_OPT_TS.

This patch uses the BIT() macro for option bits, thus it can request the
correct bitmaps for "contextid" and "timestamp" when calling
cs_etm_set_option().
