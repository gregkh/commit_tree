KVM: x86/mmu: Drop redundant trace_kvm_mmu_set_spte() in the TDP MMU

Remove TDP MMU's call to trace_kvm_mmu_set_spte() that is done for both
shadow-present SPTEs and MMIO SPTEs.  It's fully redundant for the
former, and unnecessary for the latter.  This aligns TDP MMU tracing
behavior with that of the legacy MMU.
