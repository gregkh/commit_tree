drm/amdkfd: Add aldebaran trap handler support

Similar to arcturus, but ARCH/ACC VGPRs may now be split unevenly.
A new field in SQ_WAVE_GPR_ALLOC tracks the boundary between the two
sets of VGPRs.

Squash below patches:

drm/amdkfd: Use preprocessor for IP-specific trap handler code
drm/amdkfd: Fix VGPR restore race in gfx8/gfx9 trap handler
drm/amdkfd: Remove duplicated code in gfx9 trap handler
drm/amdkfd: Separate ARCH/ACC VGPR restore in trap handler
drm/amdkfd: Reverse order of ARCH/ACC VGPR restore in trap handler
