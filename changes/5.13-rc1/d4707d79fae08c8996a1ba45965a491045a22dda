PCI: xgene: Fix cfg resource mapping

In commit e2dcd20b1645 a change was made to use
devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname() to simplify code and remove
the res variable; this was wrong since the res variable is still needed
and as an outcome the port->cfg_addr gets an erroneous address.

Revert the change going back to original behaviour.
