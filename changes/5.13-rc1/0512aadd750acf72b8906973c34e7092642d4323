powerpc/40x: Prepare normal exception handler for enabling MMU early

Ensure normal exception handler are able to manage stuff with
MMU enabled. For that we use CONFIG_VMAP_STACK related code
allthough there is no intention to really activate CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
on powerpc 40x for the moment.

40x uses SPRN_DEAR instead of SPRN_DAR and SPRN_ESR instead of
SPRN_DSISR. Take it into account in common macros.

40x MSR value doesn't fit on 15 bits, use LOAD_REG_IMMEDIATE() in
common macros that will be used also with 40x.
