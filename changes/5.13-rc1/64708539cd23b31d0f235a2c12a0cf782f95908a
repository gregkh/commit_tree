btrfs: use btrfs_inode_lock/btrfs_inode_unlock inode lock helpers

A few places we intermix btrfs_inode_lock with a inode_unlock, and some
places we just use inode_lock/inode_unlock instead of btrfs_inode_lock.

None of these places are using this incorrectly, but as we adjust some
of these callers it would be nice to keep everything consistent, so
convert everybody to use btrfs_inode_lock/btrfs_inode_unlock.
