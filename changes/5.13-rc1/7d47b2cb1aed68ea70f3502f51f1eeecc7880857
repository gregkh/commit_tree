arm64: dts: qcom: Add sc7180-trogdor-coachz skus

This is a trogdor variant.  This is mostly a grab from the downstream
tree with notable exceptions:
- I skip -rev0.  This was a super early build and there's no advantage
  of long term support.
- I remove sound node since sound hasn't landed upstream yet.
