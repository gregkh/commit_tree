crypto: hisilicon/hpre - add version adapt to new algorithms

A new generation of accelerator Kunpeng930 has appeared, and the
corresponding driver needs to be updated to support some new
algorithms of Kunpeng930. To be compatible with Kunpeng920, we
add parameter 'struct hisi_qm *qm' to sec_algs_(un)register to
identify the chip's version.
