bpftool: Add `gen object` command to perform BPF static linking

Add `bpftool gen object <output-file> <input_file>...` command to statically
link multiple BPF ELF object files into a single output BPF ELF object file.

This patch also updates bash completions and man page. Man page gets a short
section on `gen object` command, but also updates the skeleton example to show
off workflow for BPF application with two .bpf.c files, compiled individually
with Clang, then resulting object files are linked together with `gen object`,
and then final object file is used to generate usable BPF skeleton. This
should help new users understand realistic workflow w.r.t. compiling
mutli-file BPF application.
