bpf: Simplify freeing logic in linfo and jited_linfo

This patch simplifies the linfo freeing logic by combining
"bpf_prog_free_jited_linfo()" and "bpf_prog_free_unused_jited_linfo()"
into the new "bpf_prog_jit_attempt_done()".
It is a prep work for the kernel function call support.  In a later
patch, freeing the kernel function call descriptors will also
be done in the "bpf_prog_jit_attempt_done()".

"bpf_prog_free_linfo()" is removed since it is only called by
"__bpf_prog_put_noref()".  The kvfree() are directly called
instead.

It also takes this chance to s/kcalloc/kvcalloc/ for the jited_linfo
allocation.
