octeontx2-af: cn10k: Add mailbox to configure reassembly timeout

CN10K CPT coprocessor includes a component named RXC which
is responsible for reassembly of inner IP packets. RXC has
the feature to evict oldest entries based on age/threshold.
This patch adds a new mailbox to configure reassembly age
or threshold.
