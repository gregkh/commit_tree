clocksource/drivers/hyper-v: Handle vDSO differences inline

While the driver for the Hyper-V Reference TSC and STIMERs is architecture
neutral, vDSO is implemented for x86/x64, but not for ARM64.  Current code
calls into utility functions under arch/x86 (and coming, under arch/arm64)
to handle the difference.

Change this approach to handle the difference inline based on whether
VDSO_CLOCK_MODE_HVCLOCK is present.  The new approach removes code under
arch/* since the difference is tied more to the specifics of the Linux
implementation than to the architecture.

No functional change.
