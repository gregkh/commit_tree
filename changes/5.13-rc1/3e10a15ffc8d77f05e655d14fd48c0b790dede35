ceph: fix up error handling with snapdirs

There are several warts in the snapdir error handling. The -EOPNOTSUPP
return in __snapfh_to_dentry is currently lost, and the call to
ceph_handle_snapdir is not currently checked at all.

Fix all of this up and eliminate a BUG_ON in ceph_get_snapdir. We can
handle that case with a warning and return an error.
