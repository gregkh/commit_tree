block/rnbd-srv: Remove force_close file after holding a lock

We changed the rnbd_srv_sess_dev_force_close to use try-lock
because rnbd_srv_sess_dev_force_close and process_msg_close
can generate a deadlock.

Now rnbd_srv_sess_dev_force_close would do nothing
if it fails to get the lock. So removing the force_close
file should be moved to after the lock. Or the force_close
file is removed but the others are not removed.
