ext4: delete some unused tracepoint definitions

A number of tracepoint instances have been removed from ext4 by past
patches but the definitions of those tracepoints have not.

All instances of ext4_ext_in_cache and ext4_ext_put_in_cache were
removed by commit 69eb33dc24dc ("ext4: remove single extent cache").
ext4_get_reserved_cluster_alloc was removed by commit b6bf9171ef5c
("ext4: reduce reserved cluster count by number of allocated
clusters").  ext4_find_delalloc_range was removed by commit
7d1b1fbc95eb ("ext4: reimplement ext4_find_delay_alloc_range on extent
status tree").

All instances of ext4_direct_IO_enter and ext4_direct_IO_exit were
removed by commit 378f32bab371 ("ext4: introduce direct I/O write
using iomap infrastructure").
