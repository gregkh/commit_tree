media: adv7604: support EDIDs up to 4 blocks

While the adv7604/11/12 hardware supported EDIDs up to 4 blocks, the
driver didn't. This patch adds support for this. It also improves support
for EDIDs that do not have a Source Physical Address: in that case the
spa location is set to the first byte of the second block, and the
'physical address' is just the two bytes at that location. This is per
the suggestion in the adv76xx documentation for such EDIDs.

Tested with an adv7604 and adv7612.
