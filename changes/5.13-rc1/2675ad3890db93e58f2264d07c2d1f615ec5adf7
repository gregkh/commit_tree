xfs: unconditionally read all AGFs on mounts with perag reservation

perag reservation is enabled at mount time on a per AG basis. The
upcoming change to set aside allocbt blocks from block reservation
requires a populated allocbt counter as soon as possible after mount
to be fully effective against large perag reservations. Therefore as
a preparation step, initialize the pagf on all mounts where at least
one reservation is active. Note that this already occurs to some
degree on most default format filesystems as reservation requirement
calculations already depend on the AGF or AGI, depending on the
reservation type.
