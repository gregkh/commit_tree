tools/power turbostat: Enable tsc_tweak for Elkhart Lake and Jasper Lake

It was found that on Elkhart Lake the TSC frequency is driven by
a separate crystal-clock domain, which is different from the
BCLK domain which includes mperf. This has result in small different
speed thus inconsistence between TSC and the mperf, which caused the
Busy% to be higher than 100%. On this platform it seems that the mperf
runs faster than tsc when the CPU is 100% utilized:
delta tsc(18815473183) < delta mperf(18958403680) for 10 seconds.

To align TSC with mperf, leverage the tsc_tweak mechanism introduced for
cores newer than Skylake, so that TSC and mperf would be calculated in
the same domain.
