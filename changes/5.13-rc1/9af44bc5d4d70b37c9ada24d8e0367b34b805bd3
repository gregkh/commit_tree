libbpf: Add generic BTF type shallow copy API

Add btf__add_type() API that performs shallow copy of a given BTF type from
the source BTF into the destination BTF. All the information and type IDs are
preserved, but all the strings encountered are added into the destination BTF
and corresponding offsets are rewritten. BTF type IDs are assumed to be
correct or such that will be (somehow) modified afterwards.
