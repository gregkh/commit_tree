platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: add ACPI dependency

The driver now fails to build without ACPI:

drivers/platform/x86/intel_pmc_core.c: In function 'pmc_core_get_tgl_lpm_reqs':
drivers/platform/x86/intel_pmc_core.c:617:41: error: invalid use of undefined type 'struct acpi_device'
  617 |         out_obj = acpi_evaluate_dsm(adev->handle, &s0ix_dsm_guid, 0,

This could probably be made optional, but it won't be used without
ACPI in practice, so just add a Kconfig dependency.
