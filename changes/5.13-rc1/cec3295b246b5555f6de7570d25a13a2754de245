drm/i915/icp+: Use icp_hpd_irq_setup() instead of spt_hpd_irq_setup()

While reviewing patches for handling workarounds related to gen9 bc, Imre
from Intel discovered that we're using spt_hpd_irq_setup() on ICP+ PCHs
despite it being almost the same as icp_hpd_irq_setup(). Since we need to
be calling icp_hpd_irq_setup() to ensure that CML-S/TGP platforms function
correctly anyway, let's move platforms using PCH_ICP which aren't handled
by gen11_hpd_irq_setup() over to icp_hpd_irq_setup().
