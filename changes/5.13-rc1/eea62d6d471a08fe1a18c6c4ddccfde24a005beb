media: i2c: adv7511: remove open coded version of SMBus block read

The open coded version differs from the one in the core in one way: the
buffer will be always copied back, even when the transfer failed. Be
more robust: use the block read from the I2C core and propagate a
potential errno further to the sanity checks.
