media: imx-jpeg: Pass the v4l2_jpeg_header header argument by reference

Currently the header argument is being passed by value, so a copy of 256
byte structure on the stack is potentially occurring. Fix this by passing
by reference to avoid any large stack copies.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Big parameter passed by value")
