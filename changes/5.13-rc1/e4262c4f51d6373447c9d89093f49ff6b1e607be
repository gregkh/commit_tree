mm: memcontrol: rename shrinker_map to shrinker_info

The following patch is going to add nr_deferred into shrinker_map, the
change will make shrinker_map not only include map anymore, so rename it
to "memcg_shrinker_info".  And this should make the patch adding
nr_deferred cleaner and readable and make review easier.  Also remove the
"memcg_" prefix.
