KVM: x86: Rename GPR accessors to make mode-aware variants the defaults

Append raw to the direct variants of kvm_register_read/write(), and
drop the "l" from the mode-aware variants.  I.e. make the mode-aware
variants the default, and make the direct variants scary sounding so as
to discourage use.  Accessing the full 64-bit values irrespective of
mode is rarely the desired behavior.
