selftests/net: bump timeout to 5 minutes

We found that with the latest mainline kernel (5.12.0-051200rc8) on
some KVM instances / bare-metal systems, the following tests will take
longer than the kselftest framework default timeout (45 seconds) to
run and thus got terminated with TIMEOUT error:
* xfrm_policy.sh - took about 2m20s
* pmtu.sh - took about 3m5s
* udpgso_bench.sh - took about 60s

Bump the timeout setting to 5 minutes to allow them have a chance to
finish.
