perf/x86: Hybrid PMU support for intel_ctrl

The intel_ctrl is the counter mask of a PMU. The PMU counter information
may be different among hybrid PMUs, each hybrid PMU should use its own
intel_ctrl to check and access the counters.

When handling a certain hybrid PMU, apply the intel_ctrl from the
corresponding hybrid PMU.

When checking the HW existence, apply the PMU and number of counters
from the corresponding hybrid PMU as well. Perf will check the HW
existence for each Hybrid PMU before registration. Expose the
check_hw_exists() for a later patch.
