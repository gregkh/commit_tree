ASoC: q6afe-clocks: fix reprobing of the driver

Q6afe-clocks driver can get reprobed. For example if the APR services
are restarted after the firmware crash. However currently Q6afe-clocks
driver will oops because hw.init will get cleared during first _probe
call. Rewrite the driver to fill the clock data at runtime rather than
using big static array of clocks.
