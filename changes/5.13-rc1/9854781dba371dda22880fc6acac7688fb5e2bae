kunit: tool: make --kunitconfig accept dirs, add lib/kunit fragment

TL;DR
$ ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --kunitconfig=lib/kunit

Per suggestion from Ted [1], we can reduce the amount of typing by
assuming a convention that these files are named '.kunitconfig'.

In the case of [1], we now have
$ ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --kunitconfig=fs/ext4

Also add in such a fragment for kunit itself so we can give that as an
example more close to home (and thus less likely to be accidentally
broken).
