KVM: x86: Check CR3 GPA for validity regardless of vCPU mode

Check CR3 for an invalid GPA even if the vCPU isn't in long mode.  For
bigger emulation flows, notably RSM, the vCPU mode may not be accurate
if CR0/CR4 are loaded after CR3.  For MOV CR3 and similar flows, the
caller is responsible for truncating the value.
