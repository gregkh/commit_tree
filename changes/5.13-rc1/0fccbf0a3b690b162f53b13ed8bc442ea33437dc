bus: mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueue

A recent change created a dedicated workqueue for the state-change work
with WQ_HIGHPRI (no strong reason for that) and WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags,
but the state-change work (mhi_pm_st_worker) does not guarantee forward
progress under memory pressure, and will even wait on various memory
allocations when e.g. creating devices, loading firmware, etc... The
work is then not part of a memory reclaim path...

Moreover, this causes a warning in check_flush_dependency() since we end
up in code that flushes a non-reclaim workqueue:
