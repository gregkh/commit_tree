rcutorture: Fix testing of RCU priority boosting

Currently, rcutorture refuses to test RCU priority boosting in
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y kernels, which are the only kind normally built on
x86 these days.  This commit therefore updates rcutorture's tests of RCU
priority boosting to make them safe for CPU hotplug.  However, these tests
will fail unless TIMER_SOFTIRQ runs at realtime priority, which does not
happen in current mainline.  This commit therefore also refuses to test
RCU priority boosting except in kernels built with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y.

While in the area, this commt adds some debug output at boost-fail time
that helps diagnose the cause of the failure, for example, failing to
run TIMER_SOFTIRQ at realtime priority.
