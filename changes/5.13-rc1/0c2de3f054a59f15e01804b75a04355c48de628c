sched,fair: Alternative sched_slice()

The current sched_slice() seems to have issues; there's two possible
things that could be improved:

 - the 'nr_running' used for __sched_period() is daft when cgroups are
   considered. Using the RQ wide h_nr_running seems like a much more
   consistent number.

 - (esp) cgroups can slice it real fine, which makes for easy
   over-scheduling, ensure min_gran is what the name says.
