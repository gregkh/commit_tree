ASoC: core: Don't set platform name when of_node is set

A DAI link has 3 components:
	* CPU
	* platform
	* codec(s)

A component is specified via:
	* name
	* of_node
	* dai_name

In order to avoid confusion when building a sound card we disallow
matching by both name and of_node (1).

soc_check_tplg_fes allows overriding certain BE links by overriding
BE link name. This doesn't work well if BE link was specified via DT,
because we end up with a link with both name and of_node specified
which is conflicting with (1).

In order to fix this we need to:
	* override of_node if component was specified via DT
	* override name, otherwise.
