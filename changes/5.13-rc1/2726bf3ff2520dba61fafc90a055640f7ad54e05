swiotlb: Make SWIOTLB_NO_FORCE perform no allocation

When SWIOTLB_NO_FORCE is used, there should really be no allocations of
default_nslabs to occur since we are not going to use those slabs. If a
platform was somehow setting swiotlb_no_force and a later call to
swiotlb_init() was to be made we would still be proceeding with
allocating the default SWIOTLB size (64MB), whereas if swiotlb=noforce
was set on the kernel command line we would have only allocated 2KB.

This would be inconsistent and the point of initializing default_nslabs
to 1, was intended to allocate the minimum amount of memory possible, so
simply remove that minimal allocation period.
