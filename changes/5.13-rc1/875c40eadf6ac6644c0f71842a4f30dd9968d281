ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add quirk for the Chuwi Hi8 tablet

The Chuwi Hi8 tablet is using an analog mic on IN1 and has its
jack-detect connected to JD2_IN4N, instead of using the default
IN3 for its internal mic and JD1_IN4P for jack-detect.

It also only has 1 speaker.

Add a quirk applying the correct settings for this configuration.
