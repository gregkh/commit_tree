powerpc/perf: Expose processor pipeline stage cycles using PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT

Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) registers in powerpc provides
information on cycles elapsed between different stages in the
pipeline. This can be used for application tuning. On ISA v3.1
platform, this information is exposed by sampling registers.
Patch adds kernel support to capture two of the cycle counters
as part of perf sample using the sample type:
PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT.

The power PMU function 'get_mem_weight' currently uses 64 bit weight
field of perf_sample_data to capture memory latency. But following the
introduction of PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_TYPE, weight field could contain
64-bit or 32-bit value depending on the architexture support for
PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT. Patches uses WEIGHT_STRUCT to expose the
pipeline stage cycles info. Hence update the ppmu functions to work for
64-bit and 32-bit weight values.

If the sample type is PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT, use the 64-bit weight field.
if the sample type is PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT, memory subsystem
latency is stored in the low 32bits of perf_sample_weight structure.
Also for CPU_FTR_ARCH_31, capture the two cycle counter information in
two 16 bit fields of perf_sample_weight structure.
