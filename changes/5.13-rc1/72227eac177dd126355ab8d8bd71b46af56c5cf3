fuse: convert to fileattr

Since fuse just passes ioctl args through to/from server, converting to the
fileattr API is more involved, than most other filesystems.

Both .fileattr_set() and .fileattr_get() need to obtain an open file to
operate on.  The simplest way is with the following sequence:

  FUSE_OPEN
  FUSE_IOCTL
  FUSE_RELEASE

If this turns out to be a performance problem, it could be optimized for
the case when there's already a file (any file) open for the inode.
