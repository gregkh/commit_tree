counter: add IRQ or GPIO based counter

Add simple IRQ or GPIO base counter. This device is used to measure
rotation speed of some agricultural devices, so no high frequency on the
counter pin is expected.

The maximal measurement frequency depends on the CPU and system load. On
the idle iMX6S I was able to measure up to 20kHz without count drops.
