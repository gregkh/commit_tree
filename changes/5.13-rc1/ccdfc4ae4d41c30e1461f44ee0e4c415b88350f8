Revert "soc: fsl: qe: introduce qe_io{read,write}* wrappers"

This reverts commit 6ac9b61786cc64ae5cbfb69413137656f72e8204.

This commit was required because at that time, ioread/iowrite
functions were sub-optimal on powerpc/32 compared to the
architecture specific in_/out_ IO accessors.

But there are now equivalent since
commit 894fa235eb4c ("powerpc: inline iomap accessors").
