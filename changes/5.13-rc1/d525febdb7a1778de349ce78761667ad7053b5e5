media: imx: imx7-media-csi: Clear all configurable CSICR18 fields

When configuring the CSI in imx7_csi_configure(), the CSICR18 is set
through a read-modify-write cycle to avoid affecting fields whose usage
isn't clear. The function then sets fields depending on whether the
input is interlaced or progressive, and from the parallel input or the
CSI-2 receiver.

Those bits are only set and never cleared. For instance, when switching
from a CSI-2 source to the parallel input, the BIT_DATA_FROM_MIPI will
stay set. Fix this issue by first clearing all the fields we need to
configure.

Add BIT_CSI_HW_ENABLE to the set of fields being cleared, as the CSI
needs to start in the disabled state. This allows dropping the call to
imx7_csi_hw_disable() in imx7_csi_sw_reset().
