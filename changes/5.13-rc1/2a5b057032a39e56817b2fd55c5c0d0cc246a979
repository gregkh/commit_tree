ARM: dts: ux500: Fix BT+WLAN on Janice

GPIO215 has a rail named WLAN_RST_N but it is actually connected
to the pin WLAN_REG_ON on the BCM4330 chip, so this should be
the WLAN regulator GPIO rather than GPIO222. The misunderstanding
comes from the erroneous naming of the rail on the schematic.

GPIO222 is indeed connected to the rail BT_VREG_EN and the pin
BT_REG_ON, and can be handled by the driver as usual.

This corrects misunderstandings and makes Janice's WLAN and BT
setup look like that of Golden and Skomer.

Add explicit BCM4330 compatible to the WLAN chip.
