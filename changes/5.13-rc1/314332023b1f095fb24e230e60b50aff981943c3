icmp: ICMPV6: pass RFC 8335 reply messages to ping_rcv

The current icmp_rcv function drops all unknown ICMP types, including
ICMP_EXT_ECHOREPLY (type 43). In order to parse Extended Echo Reply messages, we have
to pass these packets to the ping_rcv function, which does not do any
other filtering and passes the packet to the designated socket.

Pass incoming RFC 8335 ICMP Extended Echo Reply packets to the ping_rcv
handler instead of discarding the packet.
