net: Introduce skb_send_sock() for sock_map

We only have skb_send_sock_locked() which requires callers
to use lock_sock(). Introduce a variant skb_send_sock()
which locks on its own, callers do not need to lock it
any more. This will save us from adding a ->sendmsg_locked
for each protocol.

To reuse the code, pass function pointers to __skb_send_sock()
and build skb_send_sock() and skb_send_sock_locked() on top.
