tools: do not include scripts/Kbuild.include

Since commit 57fd251c7896 ("kbuild: split cc-option and friends to
scripts/Makefile.compiler"), some kselftests fail to build.

The tools/ directory opted out Kbuild, and went in a different
direction. People copied scripts and Makefiles to the tools/ directory
to create their own build system.

tools/build/Build.include mimics scripts/Kbuild.include, but some
tool Makefiles include the Kbuild one to import a feature that is
missing in tools/build/Build.include:

 - Commit ec04aa3ae87b ("tools/thermal: tmon: use "-fstack-protector"
   only if supported") included scripts/Kbuild.include from
   tools/thermal/tmon/Makefile to import the cc-option macro.

 - Commit c2390f16fc5b ("selftests: kvm: fix for compilers that do
   not support -no-pie") included scripts/Kbuild.include from
   tools/testing/selftests/kvm/Makefile to import the try-run macro.

 - Commit 9cae4ace80ef ("selftests/bpf: do not ignore clang
   failures") included scripts/Kbuild.include from
   tools/testing/selftests/bpf/Makefile to import the .DELETE_ON_ERROR
   target.

 - Commit 0695f8bca93e ("selftests/powerpc: Handle Makefile for
   unrecognized option") included scripts/Kbuild.include from
   tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/pmu/ebb/Makefile to import the
   try-run macro.

Copy what they need into tools/build/Build.include, and make them
include it instead of scripts/Kbuild.include.
