powerpc/setup_64: Fix sparse warnings

Sparse warns:
  warning: symbol 'rfi_flush' was not declared.
  warning: symbol 'entry_flush' was not declared.
  warning: symbol 'uaccess_flush' was not declared.

Define 'entry_flush' and 'uaccess_flush' as static because they are
not referenced outside the file. Include asm/security_features.h in
which 'rfi_flush' is declared.
