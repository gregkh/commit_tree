powerpc/signal: Use __get_user() to copy sigset_t

Usually sigset_t is exactly 8B which is a "trivial" size and does not
warrant using __copy_from_user(). Use __get_user() directly in
anticipation of future work to remove the trivial size optimizations
from __copy_from_user().

The ppc32 implementation of get_sigset_t() previously called
copy_from_user() which, unlike __copy_from_user(), calls access_ok().
Replacing this w/ __get_user() (no access_ok()) is fine here since both
callsites in signal_32.c are preceded by an earlier access_ok().
