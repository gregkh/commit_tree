serial: amba-pl011: drop low-latency workaround

Commit ead76f329f77 ("ARM: 6763/1: pl011: add optional RX DMA to PL011
v2") added RX DMA support and also reproduced the workaround for the
infamous low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push() by dropping and
reacquiring the port lock during receive processing.

Since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.

Note that the port lock is also dropped in the PIO path
(see pl011_rx_chars), but it is not clear whether this is still needed
by the DMA code added by the aforementioned commit.
