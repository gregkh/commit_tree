mm/mmzone.h: fix existing kernel-doc comments and link them to core-api

There are a couple of kernel-doc comments in include/linux/mmzone.h but
they have minor formatting issues that would cause kernel-doc warnings.

Fix the formatting of those comments, add missing Return: descriptions and
link include/linux/mmzone.h to Documentation/core-api/mm-api.rst
