net: ipa: define some new memory regions

There are several memory regions that are defined starting with IPA
v4.0, but which were not used for the SC7180 SoC (IPA v4.2).  Even
though they're not used (yet), define them so they are ready to be
used for SoCs when they become supported.

There are two QUOTA statistics memory regions, one for the modem and
one for the AP.  Define distinct names for these regions, and get
rid of the definition of IPA_MEM_STATS_QUOTA.
