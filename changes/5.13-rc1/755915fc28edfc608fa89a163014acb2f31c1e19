fotg210-udc: Fix DMA on EP0 for length > max packet size

For a 75 Byte request, it would send the first 64 separately, then detect
that the remaining 11 Byte fit into a single DMA, but due to this bug set
the length to the original 75 Bytes. This leads to a DMA failure (which is
ignored...) and the request completes without the remaining bytes having
been sent.
