usbnet: add method for reporting speed without MII

The old method for reporting link speed assumed a driver uses the
generic phy (mii) MDIO read/write functions. CDC devices don't
expose the phy.

Add a primitive internal version reporting back directly what
the CDC notification/status operations recorded.

v2: rebased on upstream
v3: changed names and made clear which units are used
v4: moved hunks to correct patch; rewrote commmit messages
