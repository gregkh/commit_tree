bpf: Fix masking negation logic upon negative dst register

The negation logic for the case where the off_reg is sitting in the
dst register is not correct given then we cannot just invert the add
to a sub or vice versa. As a fix, perform the final bitwise and-op
unconditionally into AX from the off_reg, then move the pointer from
the src to dst and finally use AX as the source for the original
pointer arithmetic operation such that the inversion yields a correct
result. The single non-AX mov in between is possible given constant
blinding is retaining it as it's not an immediate based operation.
