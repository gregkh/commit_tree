sock_map: Introduce BPF_SK_SKB_VERDICT

Reusing BPF_SK_SKB_STREAM_VERDICT is possible but its name is
confusing and more importantly we still want to distinguish them
from user-space. So we can just reuse the stream verdict code but
introduce a new type of eBPF program, skb_verdict. Users are not
allowed to attach stream_verdict and skb_verdict programs to the
same map.
