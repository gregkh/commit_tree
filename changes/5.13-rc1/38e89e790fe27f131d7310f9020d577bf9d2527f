media: ti-vpe: cal: Implement media controller centric API

The CAL driver is video node centric, it controls the whole device
through the video device nodes. This limits the possible use cases as it
can't support sources that are more complex than a single subdev. To
support more complex hardware pipelines, implement support for the media
controller centric API. The exposed API can be selected through a module
parameter.
