platform/x86: dell-wmi-sysman: Cleanup create_attributes_level_sysfs_files()

Cleanup create_attributes_level_sysfs_files():

1. There is no need to call sysfs_remove_file() on error, sysman_init()
will already call release_attributes_data() on failure which already does
this.

2. There is no need for the pr_debug() calls sysfs_create_file() should
never fail and if it does it will already complain about the problem
itself.
