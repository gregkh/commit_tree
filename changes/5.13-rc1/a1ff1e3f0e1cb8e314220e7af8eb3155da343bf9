io_uring: provide io_resubmit_prep() stub for !CONFIG_BLOCK

Randy reports the following error on CONFIG_BLOCK not being set:

../fs/io_uring.c: In function ‘kiocb_done’:
../fs/io_uring.c:2766:7: error: implicit declaration of function ‘io_resubmit_prep’; did you mean ‘io_put_req’? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
   if (io_resubmit_prep(req)) {

Provide a dummy stub for io_resubmit_prep() like we do for
io_rw_should_reissue(), which also helps remove an ifdef sequence from
io_complete_rw_iopoll() as well.

Fixes: 8c130827f417 ("io_uring: don't alter iopoll reissue fail ret code")
