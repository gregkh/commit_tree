bnxt_en: fix ternary sign extension bug in bnxt_show_temp()

The problem is that bnxt_show_temp() returns long but "rc" is an int
and "len" is a u32.  With ternary operations the type promotion is quite
tricky.  The negative "rc" is first promoted to u32 and then to long so
it ends up being a high positive value instead of a a negative as we
intended.

Fix this by removing the ternary.
