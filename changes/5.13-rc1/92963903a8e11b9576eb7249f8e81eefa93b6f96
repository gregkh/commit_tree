cpufreq: armada-37xx: Fix driver cleanup when registration failed

Commit 8db82563451f ("cpufreq: armada-37xx: fix frequency calculation for
opp") changed calculation of frequency passed to the dev_pm_opp_add()
function call. But the code for dev_pm_opp_remove() function call was not
updated, so the driver cleanup phase does not work when registration fails.

This fixes the issue by using the same frequency in both calls.
