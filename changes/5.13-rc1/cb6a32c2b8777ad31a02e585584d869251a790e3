KVM: x86: Handle triple fault in L2 without killing L1

Synthesize a nested VM-Exit if L2 triggers an emulated triple fault
instead of exiting to userspace, which likely will kill L1.  Any flow
that does KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT is suspect, but the most common scenario
for L2 killing L1 is if L0 (KVM) intercepts a contributory exception that
is _not_intercepted by L1.  E.g. if KVM is intercepting #GPs for the
VMware backdoor, a #GP that occurs in L2 while vectoring an injected #DF
will cause KVM to emulate triple fault.
