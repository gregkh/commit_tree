IB/mlx5: Set right RoCE l3 type and roce version while deleting GID

Currently when GID is deleted, it zero out all the fields of the RoCE
address in the SET_ROCE_ADDRESS command for a specified index.

roce_version = 0 means RoCEv1 in the SET_ROCE_ADDRESS command.

This assumes that device has RoCEv1 always enabled which is not always
correct. For example Subfunction does not support RoCEv1.

Due to this assumption a previously added RoCEv2 GID is always deleted as
RoCEv1 GID. This results in a below syndrome:

   mlx5_core.sf mlx5_core.sf.4: mlx5_cmd_check:777:(pid 4256): SET_ROCE_ADDRESS(0x761) op_mod(0x0) failed, status bad parameter(0x3), syndrome (0x12822d)

Hence set the right RoCE version during GID deletion provided by the core.
