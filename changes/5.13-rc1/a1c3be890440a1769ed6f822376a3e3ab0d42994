drm/komeda: Fix bit check to import to value of proper type

Another issue found by KASAN. The bit finding is buried inside the
dp_for_each_set_bit() macro (that passes on to for_each_set_bit() that
calls the bit stuff. These bit functions want an unsigned long pointer
as input and just dumbly casting leads to out-of-bounds accesses.
This fixes that.
