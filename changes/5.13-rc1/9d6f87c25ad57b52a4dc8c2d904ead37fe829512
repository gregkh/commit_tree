scsi: qedf: Use devlink to report errors and recovery

Use devlink_health_report() to push error indications.

Implement this in qede via a callback function to make it possible to reuse
it for other drivers sitting on top of qed in future. Also remove forcible
recovery trigger and put it as a normal devlink callback in qed module.

This allows user to enable/disable it via:

    devlink health set pci/xxxx:xx:xx.x reporter fw_fatal auto_recover false
