remoteproc: stm32: add capability to detach

A mechanism similar to the shutdown mailbox signal is implemented to
detach a remote processor.

Upon detachment, a signal is sent to the remote firmware, allowing it
to perform specific actions such as stopping rpmsg communication.

The Cortex-M hold boot is also disabled to allow the remote processor
to restart in case of crash.
