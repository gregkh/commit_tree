net: macb: Disable PCS auto-negotiation for SGMII fixed-link mode

When using a fixed-link configuration in SGMII mode, it's not really
sensible to have auto-negotiation enabled since the link settings are
fixed by definition. In other configurations, such as an SGMII
connection to a PHY, it should generally be enabled.
