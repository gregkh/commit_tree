mtd: spi-nor: implement OTP support for Winbond and similar flashes

Use the new OTP ops to implement OTP access on Winbond flashes. Most
Winbond flashes provides up to four different OTP regions ("Security
Registers").

Winbond devices use a special opcode to read and write to the OTP
regions, just like the RDSFDP opcode. In fact, it seems that the
(undocumented) first OTP area of the newer flashes is the actual SFDP
table.

On a side note, Winbond devices also allow erasing the OTP regions as
long as the area isn't locked down.
