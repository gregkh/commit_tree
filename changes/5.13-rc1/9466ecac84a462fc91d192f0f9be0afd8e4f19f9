kselftest/arm64: mte: Makefile: Fix clang compilation

When clang finds a header file on the command line, it wants to
precompile that, which would end up in a separate output file.
Specifying -o on that same command line collides with that effort, so
the compiler complains:

clang: error: cannot specify -o when generating multiple output files

Since we are not really after a precompiled header, just drop the header
file from the command line, by removing it from the list of source
files in the Makefile.
