serial: txx9: drop low-latency workaround

Commit f5ee56cc184e ("[PATCH] txx9 serial update") worked around the
infamous low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push() by simply
dropping and reacquiring the port lock in the interrupt handler.

Since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.
