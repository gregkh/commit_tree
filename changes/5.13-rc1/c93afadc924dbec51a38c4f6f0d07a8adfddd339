perf parse-events: Compare with hybrid pmu name

On hybrid platform, user may want to enable event only on one pmu.
Following syntax will be supported:

cpu_core/<event>/
cpu_atom/<event>/

For hardware event, hardware cache event and raw event, two events
are created by default. We pass the specified pmu name in parse_state
and it would be checked before event creation. So next only the
event with the specified pmu would be created.
