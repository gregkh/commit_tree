drm/msm/dsi: remove temp data from global pll structure

The 7nm, 10nm and 14nm drivers would store interim data used during
VCO/PLL rate setting in the global dsi_pll_Nnm structure. Move this data
structures to the onstack storage. While we are at it, drop
unused/static 'config' data, unused config fields, etc.
