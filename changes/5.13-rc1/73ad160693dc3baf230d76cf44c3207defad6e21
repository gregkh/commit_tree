KVM: x86/mmu: WARN on NULL pae_root or lm_root, or bad shadow root level

WARN if KVM is about to dereference a NULL pae_root or lm_root when
loading an MMU, and convert the BUG() on a bad shadow_root_level into a
WARN (now that errors are handled cleanly).  With nested NPT, botching
the level and sending KVM down the wrong path is all too easy, and the
on-demand allocation of pae_root and lm_root means bugs crash the host.
Obviously, KVM could unconditionally allocate the roots, but that's
arguably a worse failure mode as it would potentially corrupt the guest
instead of crashing it.
