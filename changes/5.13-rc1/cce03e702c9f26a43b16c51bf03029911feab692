drivers/perf: hisi: Update DDRC PMU for programmable counter

DDRC PMU's events are useful for performance profiling, but the events
are limited and counter is fixed. On HiSilicon Hip09 platform, PMU
counters are the programmable and more events are supported. Let's
add the DDRC PMU v2 driver.

Bandwidth events are exposed directly in driver and some more events
will listed in JSON file later.
