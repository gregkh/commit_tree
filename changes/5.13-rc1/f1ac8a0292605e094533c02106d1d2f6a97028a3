drm/i915: Fix pread/pwrite to work with new locking rules.

We are removing obj->mm.lock, and need to take the reservation lock
before we can pin pages. Move the pinning pages into the helper, and
merge gtt pwrite/pread preparation and cleanup paths.

The fence lock is also removed; it will conflict with fence annotations,
because of memory allocations done when pagefaulting inside copy_*_user.
