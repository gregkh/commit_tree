Input: mms114 - support MMS136

The Melfas MMS136 is similar to the other MMS variants but
has event packages of 6 bytes rather than 8 as the others.

The define is named FINGER_EVENT_SZ in the vendor drivers
so I renamed it from MMS*_PACKET_SZ to MMS*_EVENT_SZ.

After this patch, the touchscreen on the Samsung GT-I8530
works fine with PostmarketOS.
