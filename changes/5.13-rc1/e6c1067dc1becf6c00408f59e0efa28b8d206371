ACPI: scan: Fold acpi_bus_type_and_status() into its caller

There is only one caller of acpi_bus_type_and_status() which is
acpi_bus_check_add(), so fold the former into the latter and use
the observation that the initial status of the device is
ACPI_STA_DEFAULT in all cases except for ACPI_BUS_TYPE_PROCESSOR
to simplify the code.

No intentional functional impact.
