perf: Cap allocation order at aux_watermark

Currently, we start allocating AUX pages half the size of the total
requested AUX buffer size, ignoring the attr.aux_watermark setting. This,
in turn, makes intel_pt driver disregard the watermark also, as it uses
page order for its SG (ToPA) configuration.

Now, this can be fixed in the intel_pt PMU driver, but seeing as it's the
only one currently making use of high order allocations, there is no
reason not to fix the allocator instead. This way, any other driver
wishing to add this support would not have to worry about this.
