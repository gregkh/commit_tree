usb: dwc2: Allow exiting hibernation from gpwrdn rst detect

When device cable is disconnected core receives suspend
interrupt and enters hibernation. After entering
into hibernation GPWRDN_RST_DET and GPWRDN_STS_CHGINT
interrupts are asserted.

Allowed exit from gadget hibernation from
GPWRDN_RST_DET by checking only linestate.

Changed the return type of "dwc2_handle_gpwrdn_intr()"
function from void to int because exit from hibernation
functions have a return value.
