serial: sifive: drop low-latency workaround

The sifive driver has always carried an unnecessary workaround for the
infamous low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push() which had been
removed years before the driver was added by commit 45c054d0815b ("tty:
serial: add driver for the SiFive UART").

Specifically, since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.
