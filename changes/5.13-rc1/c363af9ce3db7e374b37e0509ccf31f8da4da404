usb: dwc2: Update exit hibernation when port reset is asserted

No need to check for "DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_HIBERNATION" param
as "hsotg->hibernated" flag is already enough for exiting from
hibernation mode.

- Removes checking of "DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_HIBERNATION" param.

- For code readability Hibernation exit code moved after
debug message print.

- Added "dwc2_exit_hibernation()" function error checking.
