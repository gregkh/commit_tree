Drivers: hv: Redo Hyper-V synthetic MSR get/set functions

Current code defines a separate get and set macro for each Hyper-V
synthetic MSR used by the VMbus driver. Furthermore, the get macro
can't be converted to a standard function because the second argument
is modified in place, which is somewhat bad form.

Redo this by providing a single get and a single set function that
take a parameter specifying the MSR to be operated on. Fixup usage
of the get function. Calling locations are no more complex than before,
but the code under arch/x86 and the upcoming code under arch/arm64
is significantly simplified.

Also standardize the names of Hyper-V synthetic MSRs that are
architecture neutral. But keep the old x86-specific names as aliases
that can be removed later when all references (particularly in KVM
code) have been cleaned up in a separate patch series.

No functional change.
