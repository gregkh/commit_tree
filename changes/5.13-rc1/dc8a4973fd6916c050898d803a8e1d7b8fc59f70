drm/msm/disp/dpu1: add flags to indicate obsolete irqs

Some irqs which are applicable for sdm845 target are no
longer applicable for sc7180 and sc7280 targets. Add a
flag to indicate the irqs which are obsolete for a
particular target so that these irqs are skipped while
checking for matching irq lookup index.
