proc: mandate ->proc_lseek in "struct proc_ops"

Now that proc_ops are separate from file_operations and other operations
it easy to check all instances to have ->proc_lseek hook and remove check
in main code.

Note:
nonseekable_open() files naturally don't require ->proc_lseek.

Garbage collect pde_lseek() function.
