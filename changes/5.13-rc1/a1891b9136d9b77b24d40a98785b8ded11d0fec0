drm/tegra: Annotate dma-fence critical section in commit path

Again ends just after drm_atomic_helper_commit_hw_done(), but with the
twist that we need to make sure we're only annotate the custom
version. And not the other clause which just calls
drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm(), which is already annotated.
