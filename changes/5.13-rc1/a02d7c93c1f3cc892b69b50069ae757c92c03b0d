firmware: arm_scmi: Make notify_priv really private

Notification private data is currently accessible via handle->notify_priv,
this data was indeed meant to be private to the notification core support
and not to be accessible by SCMI drivers. Make it private hiding it
inside instance descriptor struct scmi_info and accessible only via
dedicated helpers.
