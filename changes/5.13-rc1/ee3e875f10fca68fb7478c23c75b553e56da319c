net: enetc: increase TX ring size

Now that commit d6a2829e82cf ("net: enetc: increase RX ring default
size") has increased the RX ring size, it is quite easy to congest the
TX rings when the traffic is predominantly XDP_TX, as the RX ring is
quite a bit larger than the TX one.

Since we bit the bullet and did the expensive thing already (larger RX
rings consume more memory pages), it seems quite foolish to keep the TX
rings small. So make them equally sized with TX.
