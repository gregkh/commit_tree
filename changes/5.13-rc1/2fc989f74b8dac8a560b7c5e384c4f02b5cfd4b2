drivers: phy: add support for Armada CP110 UTMI PHY

Add support for Marvell CP110 UTMI PHY driver allowing the USB2
port configuration independently from the boot loader setup.
The CP110/CP115 dies have 2 UTMI PHYs that could be connected
to two USB host controllers or to single USB device controller.
Since there is only one USB device controller on die, only one
of the UTMI PHYs could work in USB device mode.
The CONFIG_PHY_MVEBU_CP110_UTMI should be enabled for usage of
this driver.
