spi: rockchip: avoid objtool warning

Building this file with clang leads to a an unreachable code path
causing a warning from objtool:

drivers/spi/spi-rockchip.o: warning: objtool: rockchip_spi_transfer_one()+0x2e0: sibling call from callable instruction with modified stack frame

Change the unreachable() into an error return that can be
handled if it ever happens, rather than silently crashing
the kernel.
