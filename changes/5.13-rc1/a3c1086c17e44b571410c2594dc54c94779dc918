ARM: dts: clps711x: Add an empty chosen node to top level DTSI

Missing "chosen" node can cause issues when booting a kernel
with a boot-loader that doesn't create a chosen node if this
isn't present in the DTB since the decompressor relies on a
pre-existing chosen node to be available to insert the command
line and merge other ATAGS info.
