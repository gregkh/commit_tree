staging: comedi: dt2814: Clear stale AI data before operation

When performing a Comedi read instruction or setting up an asynchronous
command on the AI subdevice, clear any stale data on the A/D registers
by waiting for the Status register's BUSY bit to clear (if set) and then
if the FINISH or ERR bit is set, reading the A/D Data register twice to
clear the stale data.
