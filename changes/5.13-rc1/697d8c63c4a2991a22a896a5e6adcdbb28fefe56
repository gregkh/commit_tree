tasklets: Replace spin wait in tasklet_kill()

tasklet_kill() spin waits for TASKLET_STATE_SCHED to be cleared invoking
yield() from inside the loop. yield() is an ill defined mechanism and the
result might still be wasting CPU cycles in a tight loop which is
especially painful in a guest when the CPU running the tasklet is scheduled
out.

tasklet_kill() is used in teardown paths and not performance critical at
all. Replace the spin wait with wait_var_event().
