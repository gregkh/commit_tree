phy: ti: j721e-wiz: Remove "regmap_field" from wiz_clk_{mux|div}_sel

Both "struct wiz_clk_div_sel" and "struct wiz_clk_mux_sel" are static
data that is common for all wiz instances. Including
"struct regmap_field" for each of the wiz instances can yield undesirable
results. Move "struct regmap_field" out of "struct wiz_clk_div_sel" and
"struct wiz_clk_mux_sel" and make them point to constant data.

So far no issues are observed since both these structures are not
accessed outside the probe.
