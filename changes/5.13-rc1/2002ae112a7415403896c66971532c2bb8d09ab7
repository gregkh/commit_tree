btrfs: handle btrfs_record_root_in_trans failure in btrfs_recover_log_trees

btrfs_record_root_in_trans will return errors in the future, so handle
the error properly in btrfs_recover_log_trees.

This appears tricky, however we have a reference count on the
destination root, so if this fails we need to continue on in the loop to
make sure the proper cleanup is done.
