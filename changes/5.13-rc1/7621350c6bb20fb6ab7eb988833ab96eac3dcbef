drm/syncobj: make lockdep complain on WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT v3

DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT can't be used when we hold locks
since we are basically waiting for userspace to do something.

Holding a lock while doing so can trivial deadlock with page faults
etc...

So make lockdep complain when a driver tries to do this.

v2: Add lockdep_assert_none_held() macro.
v3: Add might_sleep() and also use lockdep_assert_none_held() in the
    IOCTL path.
