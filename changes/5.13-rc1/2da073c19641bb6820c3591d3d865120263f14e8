riscv: Cleanup KASAN_VMALLOC support

When KASAN vmalloc region is populated, there is no userspace process and
the page table in use is swapper_pg_dir, so there is no need to read
SATP. Then we can use the same scheme used by kasan_populate_p*d
functions to go through the page table, which harmonizes the code.

In addition, make use of set_pgd that goes through all unused page table
levels, contrary to p*d_populate functions, which makes this function work
whatever the number of page table levels.
