ice: Use default configuration mode for PHY configuration

Recent firmware supports a new "get PHY capabilities" mode
ICE_AQC_REPORT_DFLT_CFG which makes it unnecessary for the driver
to track and apply NVM based default link overrides.

If FW AQ API version supports it, use Report Default Configuration.
Add check function for Report Default Configuration support and update
accordingly.

Also change adv_phy_type_[lo|hi] to advert_phy_type[lo|hi] for
clarity.
