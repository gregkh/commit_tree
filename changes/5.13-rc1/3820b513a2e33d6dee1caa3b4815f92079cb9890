rcu/nocb: Detect unsafe checks for offloaded rdp

Provide CONFIG_PROVE_RCU sanity checks to ensure we are always reading
the offloaded state of an rdp in a safe and stable way and prevent from
its value to be changed under us. We must either hold the barrier mutex,
the cpu-hotplug lock (read or write) or the nocb lock.
Local non-preemptible reads are also safe. NOCB kthreads and timers have
their own means of synchronization against the offloaded state updaters.
