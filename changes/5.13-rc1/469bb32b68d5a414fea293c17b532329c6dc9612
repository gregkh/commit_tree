KVM: SVM: Skip SEV cache flush if no ASIDs have been used

Skip SEV's expensive WBINVD and DF_FLUSH if there are no SEV ASIDs
waiting to be reclaimed, e.g. if SEV was never used.  This "fixes" an
issue where the DF_FLUSH fails during hardware teardown if the original
SEV_INIT failed.  Ideally, SEV wouldn't be marked as enabled in KVM if
SEV_INIT fails, but that's a problem for another day.
