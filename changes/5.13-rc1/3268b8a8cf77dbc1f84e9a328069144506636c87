scsi: smartpqi: Fix driver synchronization issues

 - Synchronize OFA and controller offline events. Prevent I/O during the
   above conditions.

 - Cleanup pqi_device_wait_for_pending_io() by checking the
   device->scsi_cmds_outstanding instead of walking the device's list of
   commands.

 - Stop failing all I/O for all devices. This was causing OS to retry them,
   delaying OFA.

 - Clean up cache flush. The controller is checked for offline status in
   lower level functions.
