linux/kconfig.h: replace IF_ENABLED() with PTR_IF() in <linux/kernel.h>

<linux/kconfig.h> is included from all the kernel-space source files,
including C, assembly, linker scripts. It is intended to contain a
minimal set of macros to evaluate CONFIG options.

IF_ENABLED() is an intruder here because (x ? y : z) is C code, which
should not be included from assembly files or linker scripts.

Also, <linux/kconfig.h> is no longer self-contained because NULL is
defined in <linux/stddef.h>.

Move IF_ENABLED() out to <linux/kernel.h> as PTR_IF(). PTF_IF()
takes the general boolean expression instead of a CONFIG option
so that it fits better in <linux/kernel.h>.
