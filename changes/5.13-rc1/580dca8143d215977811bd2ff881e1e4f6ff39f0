blk-mq: set default elevator as deadline in case of hctx shared tagset

Yanhui found that write performance is degraded a lot after applying
hctx shared tagset on one test machine with megaraid_sas. And turns out
it is caused by none scheduler which becomes default elevator caused by
hctx shared tagset patchset.

Given more scsi HBAs will apply hctx shared tagset, and the similar
performance exists for them too.

So keep previous behavior by still using default mq-deadline for queues
which apply hctx shared tagset, just like before.
