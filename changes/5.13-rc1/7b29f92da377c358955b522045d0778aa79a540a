io_uring: cache async and regular file state for fixed files

We have to dig quite deep to check for particularly whether or not a
file supports a fast-path nonblock attempt. For fixed files, we can do
this lookup once and cache the state instead.

This adds two new bits to track whether we support async read/write
attempt, and lines up the REQ_F_ISREG bit with those two. The file slot
re-uses the last 3 (or 2, for 32-bit) of the file pointer to cache that
state, and then we mask it in when we go and use a fixed file.
