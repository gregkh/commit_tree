selftests/resctrl: Fix checking for < 0 for unsigned values

Dan reported following static checker warnings

tools/testing/selftests/resctrl/resctrl_val.c:545 measure_vals()
warn: 'bw_imc' unsigned <= 0

tools/testing/selftests/resctrl/resctrl_val.c:549 measure_vals()
warn: 'bw_resc_end' unsigned <= 0

These warnings are reported because
1. measure_vals() declares 'bw_imc' and 'bw_resc_end' as unsigned long
   variables
2. Return value of get_mem_bw_imc() and get_mem_bw_resctrl() are assigned
   to 'bw_imc' and 'bw_resc_end' respectively
3. The returned values are checked for <= 0 to see if the calls failed

Checking for < 0 for an unsigned value doesn't make any sense.

Fix this issue by changing the implementation of get_mem_bw_imc() and
get_mem_bw_resctrl() such that they now accept reference to a variable
and set the variable appropriately upon success and return 0, else return
< 0 on error.
