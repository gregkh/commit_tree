arm64/sve: Remove redundant system_supports_sve() tests

Currently there are a number of places in the SVE code where we check both
system_supports_sve() and TIF_SVE. This is a bit redundant given that we
should never get into a situation where we have set TIF_SVE without having
SVE support and it is not clear that silently ignoring a mistakenly set
TIF_SVE flag is the most sensible error handling approach. For now let's
just drop the system_supports_sve() checks since this will at least reduce
overhead a little.
