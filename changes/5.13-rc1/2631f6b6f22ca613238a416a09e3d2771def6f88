s390/pci: unify de-/configure for slots and events

A zPCI event with PEC 0x0301 for an existing zPCI device goes through
the same actions as enable_slot(). Similarly a zPCI event with PEC
0x0303 does the same steps as disable_slot().
We can thus unify both actions as zpci_configure_device() respectively
zpci_deconfigure_device().
