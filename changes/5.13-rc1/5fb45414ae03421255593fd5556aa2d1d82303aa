ALSA: usb-audio: Add error checks for usb_driver_claim_interface() calls

There are a few calls of usb_driver_claim_interface() but all of those
miss the proper error checks, as reported by Coverity.  This patch
adds those missing checks.

Along with it, replace the magic pointer with -1 with a constant
USB_AUDIO_IFACE_UNUSED for better readability.
