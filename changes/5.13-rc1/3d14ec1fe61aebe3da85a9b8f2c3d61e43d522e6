iov_iter: Four fixes for ITER_XARRAY

Fix four things[1] in the patch that adds ITER_XARRAY[2]:

 (1) Remove the address_space struct predeclaration.  This is a holdover
     from when it was ITER_MAPPING.

 (2) Fix _copy_mc_to_iter() so that the xarray segment updates count and
     iov_offset in the iterator before returning.

 (3) Fix iov_iter_alignment() to not loop in the xarray case.  Because the
     middle pages are all whole pages, only the end pages need be
     considered - and this can be reduced to just looking at the start
     position in the xarray and the iteration size.

 (4) Fix iov_iter_advance() to limit the size of the advance to no more
     than the remaining iteration size.
