KVM: arm64: Don't retrieve memory slot again in page fault handler

We needn't retrieve the memory slot again in user_mem_abort() because
the corresponding memory slot has been passed from the caller. This
would save some CPU cycles. For example, the time used to write 1GB
memory, which is backed by 2MB hugetlb pages and write-protected, is
dropped by 6.8% from 928ms to 864ms.
