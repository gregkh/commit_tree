Revert "ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for many Roland devices..."

This reverts commit d86f43b17ed4 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for
many Roland devices' feedback quirks").

It turned out that many quirk entries there don't contain the proper
EP values and/or the quirk types, which lead to the broken
operations.

As we're going to cover all Roland/BOSS devices in a more generic way
rather the explicit lists, let's revert the previous additions at
first.
