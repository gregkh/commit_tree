Bluetooth: btbcm: Rewrite bindings in YAML and add reset

This rewrites the Broadcom bluetooth bindings in YAML and
adds a GPIO handle for the BT_RST_N line as used on some
platforms.

The Ingenic UART binding was using this binding in its
example DTS fragment, however mistakenly using "vcc-supply"
for what is called "vbat-supply". The proper DTS files
and the code in the kernel all use "vbat-supply" so
fix up the example in this patch so we ge a clean
check.
