soc/tegra: regulators: Fix locking up when voltage-spread is out of range

Fix voltage coupler lockup which happens when voltage-spread is out
of range due to a bug in the code. The max-spread requirement shall be
accounted when CPU regulator doesn't have consumers. This problem is
observed on Tegra30 Ouya game console once system-wide DVFS is enabled
in a device-tree.
