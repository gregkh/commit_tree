iio: lmp91000: Remove code to set trigger parent

iio_trigger_set_drvdata() sets the trigger device parent to first
argument of viio_trigger_alloc(), no need to do it again in the driver
code.

Given data->dev is dev, and we call devm_iio_trigger_alloc with
dev instead of data->dev, we do not have to set data->trig->dev.parent to
dev anymore.
