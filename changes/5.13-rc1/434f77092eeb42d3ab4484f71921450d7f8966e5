HID: logitech-dj: Handle newer quad/bt2.0 receivers in HID proxy mode

The Dinovo Edge and Dinovo Mini keyboards with builtin touchpad come with
a different version of the quad/bt2.0 combo receivers shipped with the
MX5000 and MX5500 keyboards. These receivers are compatible with one
another, e.g. the Dinovo Edge keyboard can be paired with the MX5000
receiver.

Like the MX5x00 receivers in HID proxy mode these receivers present
themselves as a hub with multiple USB-HID devices, one for the keyboard
and one for the mouse.

Where they differ is that the mouse USB-device has 2 input reports for
reporting mice events. It has the exact same INPUT(2) report as the
MX5x00 receivers, but it also has a second INPUT(5) mouse report which
is different; and when the Dinovo receivers are paired with the Dinovo
keyboards the second INPUT(5) mouse report is actually used for events
on the builtin touchpad.

Add support for handling the Dinovo quad/bluetooth-2.0 combo receivers
in HID proxy mode to logitech-dj, like we already do for the similar
MX5000 and MX5500 receivers.

This adds battery monitoring functionality (through logitech-hidpp) and
fixes the Phone (Fn + F1) and "[A]" - "[D]" (Fn + F9 - F12) hotkeys not
working on the Dinovo Edge.

Note these receivers present themselves as a hub with 2 separate USB
devices for the keyboard and mouse; and the logitech-dj code needs to
bind to both devices (just as with the MX5x00 receivers).
