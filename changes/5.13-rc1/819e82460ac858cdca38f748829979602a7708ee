pwm: bcm-kona: Don't modify HW state in .remove callback

A consumer is expected to disable a PWM before calling pwm_put(). And if
they didn't there is hopefully a good reason (or the consumer needs
fixing.) Also if disabling an enabled PWM was the right thing to do, this
should better be done in the framework instead of in each low level driver.

So drop the hardware modification from the .remove() callback.
