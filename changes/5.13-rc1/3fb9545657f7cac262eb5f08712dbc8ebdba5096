phy: ti: j721e-wiz: Get PHY properties only for "phy" or "link" subnode

"serdes" node (child node of WIZ) can have sub-nodes for representing links
or it can have sub-nodes for representing the various clocks within the
serdes. Instead of trying to read "reg" from every child node used for
assigning "lane_phy_type", read only if the child node's name is "phy"
or "link" subnode.
Ideally all PHY dt nodes should have node name as "phy", however
existing devicetree used "link" as subnode. So in order to maintain old
DT compatibility get PHY properties for "phy" or "link" subnode.
