cpuidle: tegra: Fix C7 idling state on Tegra114

Trusted Foundation firmware doesn't implement the do_idle call and in
this case suspending should fall back to the common suspend path. In order
to fix this issue we will unconditionally set the NOFLUSH_L2 mode via
firmware call, which is a NO-OP on Tegra30/124, and then proceed to the
C7 idling, like it was done by the older Tegra114 cpuidle driver.
