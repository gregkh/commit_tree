drm/gma500: Drop DRM_GMA3600 config option

With support for the MID-related chips removed, only support for
desktop chips is left in the driver. So just build the complete
driver if DRM_GMA500 has been selected. Anyone who wants to enable
the Poulsbo code would probably also want the Cedarview code.
