KVM: arm64: Generate final CTR_EL0 value when running in Protected mode

In protected mode, late CPUs are not allowed to boot (enforced by
the PSCI relay). We can thus specialise the read_ctr macro to
always return a pre-computed, sanitised value. Special care is
taken to prevent the use of this custome version outside of
the protected mode.
