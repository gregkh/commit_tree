iio: sx9310: Fix access to variable DT array

With the current code, we want to read 4 entries from DT array
"semtech,combined-sensors". If there are less, we silently fail as
of_property_read_u32_array() returns -EOVERFLOW.

First count the number of entries and if between 1 and 4, collect the
content of the array.
