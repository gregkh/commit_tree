x86/hyper-v: Move hv_message_type to architecture neutral module

The definition of enum hv_message_type includes arch neutral and
x86/x64-specific values. Ideally there would be a way to put the
arch neutral values in an arch neutral module, and the arch
specific values in an arch specific module. But C doesn't provide
a way to extend enum types. As a compromise, move the entire
definition into an arch neutral module, to avoid duplicating the
arch neutral values for x86/x64 and for ARM64.

No functional change.
