Input: cyttsp - verbose error on soft reset

The first thing the Cypress driver does when starting
up is to try a soft reset. This is the first point where
the driver SPI/I2C communication can fail, so put out some
nice debug text:

  cyttsp-spi spi2.0: failed to send soft reset

Instead of just:

  cyttsp-spi: probe of spi2.0 failed with error -5

This is more helpful.
