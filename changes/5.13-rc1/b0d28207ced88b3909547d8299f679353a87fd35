bnxt_en: Add a new phy_flags field to the main driver structure.

Copy the phy related feature flags from the firmware call
HWRM_PORT_PHY_QCAPS to this new field.  We can also remove the flags
field in the bnxt_test_info structure.  It's cleaner to have all PHY
related flags in one location, directly copied from the firmware.

To keep the BNXT_PHY_CFG_ABLE() macro logic the same, we need to make
a slight adjustment to check that it is a PF.
