ext4: annotate data race in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata()

Assertion checks in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() are known to be racy
but we don't want to be grabbing locks just for them.  We thus recheck
them under b_state_lock only if it looks like they would fail. Annotate
the checks with data_race().
