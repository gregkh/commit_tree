net: stmmac: support FPE link partner hand-shaking procedure

In order to discover whether remote station supports frame preemption,
local station sends verify mPacket and expects response mPacket in
return from the remote station.

So, we add the functions to send and handle event when verify mPacket
and response mPacket are exchanged between the networked stations.

The mechanism to handle different FPE states between local and remote
station (link partner) is implemented using workqueue which starts a
task each time there is some sign of verify & response mPacket exchange
as check in FPE IRQ event. The task retries couple of times to try to
spot the states that both stations are ready to enter FPE ON. This allows
different end points to enable FPE at different time and verify-response
mPacket can happen asynchronously. Ultimately, the task will only turn
FPE ON when local station have both exchange response in both directions.

Thanks to Voon Weifeng for implementing the core functions for detecting
FPE events and send mPacket and phylink related change.
