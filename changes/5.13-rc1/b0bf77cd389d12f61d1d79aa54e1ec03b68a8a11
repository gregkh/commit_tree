usb: dwc3: Fix dereferencing of null dwc->usb_psy

Currently the null check logic on dwc->usb_psy is inverted as it allows
calls to power_supply_put with a null dwc->usb_psy causing a null
pointer dereference. Fix this by removing the ! operator.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference after null check")
