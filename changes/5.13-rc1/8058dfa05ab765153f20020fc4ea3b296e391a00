soc: qcom: address kernel-doc warnings

The command:

  find ./include/linux/soc/qcom/ | xargs ./scripts/kernel-doc -none

reports:

  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/qmi.h:26: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct qmi_header '
  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/qmi.h:101: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct qmi_response_type_v01 '
  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/irq.h:19: warning: expecting prototype for QCOM specific IRQ domain flags that distinguishes the handling of wakeup(). Prototype was for IRQ_DOMAIN_FLAG_QCOM_PDC_WAKEUP() instead
  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/apr.h:126: warning: Function parameter or member '__apr_driver' not described in 'module_apr_driver'
  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/apr.h:126: warning: Excess function parameter '__aprbus_driver' description in 'module_apr_driver'
  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/llcc-qcom.h:43: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct llcc_slice_desc '
  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/llcc-qcom.h:60: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct llcc_edac_reg_data '
  ./include/linux/soc/qcom/llcc-qcom.h:86: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct llcc_drv_data '

Address all those warnings by:
  - prefixing kernel-doc descriptions for structs with the keyword 'struct',
  - turning a kernel-doc comment that does not follow the kernel-doc syntax
  into a normal comment, and
  - correcting a parameter name in a kernel-doc comment.
