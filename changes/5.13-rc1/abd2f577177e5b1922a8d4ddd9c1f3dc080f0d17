drm/i915: Flatten obj->mm.lock

shrinker is all we need now to flatten the locking hierarchy.

[danvet: Resolve conflict because we don't have the patch from Chris
to rebrand i915_gem_shrinker_taints_mutex to fs_reclaim_taints_mutex.
It's not a bad idea, but if we do it, it should be moved to the right
header. See
