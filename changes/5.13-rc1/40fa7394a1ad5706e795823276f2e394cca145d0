scsi: pm80xx: Fix potential infinite loop

The for-loop iterates with a u8 loop counter i and compares this with the
loop upper limit of pm8001_ha->max_q_num which is a u32 type.  There is a
potential infinite loop if pm8001_ha->max_q_num is larger than the u8 loop
counter. Fix this by making the loop counter the same type as
pm8001_ha->max_q_num.

[mkp: this is purely theoretical, max_q_num is currently limited to 64]
