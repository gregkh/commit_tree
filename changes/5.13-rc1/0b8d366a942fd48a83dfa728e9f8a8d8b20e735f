x86/paravirt: Simplify paravirt macros

The central pvops call macros ____PVOP_CALL() and ____PVOP_VCALL() are
looking very similar now.

The main differences are using PVOP_VCALL_ARGS or PVOP_CALL_ARGS, which
are identical, and the return value handling.

So drop PVOP_VCALL_ARGS and instead of ____PVOP_VCALL() just use
(void)____PVOP_CALL(long, ...).

Note that it isn't easily possible to just redefine ____PVOP_VCALL()
to use ____PVOP_CALL() instead, as this would require further hiding of
commas in macro parameters.
