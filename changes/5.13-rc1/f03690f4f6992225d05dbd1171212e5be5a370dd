soundwire: bus: Fix device found flag correctly

found flag is used to indicate SoundWire devices that are
both enumerated on the bus and available in the device list.
However this flag is not reset correctly after one iteration,
This could miss some of the devices that are enumerated on the
bus but not in device list. So reset this correctly to fix this issue!
