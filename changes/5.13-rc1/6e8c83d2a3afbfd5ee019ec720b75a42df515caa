x86/insn-eval: Handle return values from the decoder

Now that the different instruction-inspecting functions return a value,
test that and return early from callers if error has been encountered.

While at it, do not call insn_get_modrm() when calling
insn_get_displacement() because latter will make sure to call
insn_get_modrm() if ModRM hasn't been parsed yet.
