KVM: arm64: Use BUG and BUG_ON in nVHE hyp

hyp_panic() reports the address of the panic by using ELR_EL2, but this
isn't a useful address when hyp_panic() is called directly. Replace such
direct calls with BUG() and BUG_ON() which use BRK to trigger an
exception that then goes to hyp_panic() with the correct address. Also
remove the hyp_panic() declaration from the header file to avoid
accidental misuse.
