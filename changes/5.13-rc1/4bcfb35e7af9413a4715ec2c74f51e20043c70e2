net: ipa: index resource limits with type

Remove the type field from the ipa_resource_src and ipa_resource_dst
structures, and instead use that value as the index into the arrays
of source and destination resources.

Change ipa_resource_config_src() and ipa_resource_config_dst() so
the resource type is passed in as an argument.
