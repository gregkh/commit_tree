io_uring: fix NULL reg-buffer

io_import_fixed() doesn't expect a registered buffer slot to be NULL and
would fail stumbling on it. We don't allow it, but if during
__io_sqe_buffers_update() rsrc removal succeeds but following register
fails, we'll get such a situation.

Do it atomically and don't remove buffers until we sure that a new one
can be set.
