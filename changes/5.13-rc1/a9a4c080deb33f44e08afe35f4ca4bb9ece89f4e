wlcore: Fix buffer overrun by snprintf due to incorrect buffer size

The size of the buffer than can be written to is currently incorrect, it is
always the size of the entire buffer even though the snprintf is writing
as position pos into the buffer. Fix this by setting the buffer size to be
the number of bytes left in the buffer, namely sizeof(buf) - pos.
