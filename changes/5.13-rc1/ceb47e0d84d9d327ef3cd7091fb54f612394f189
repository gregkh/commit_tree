drm/amdgpu: Fix SDMA RAS error reporting on Aldebaran

Fix the following issues with SDMA RAS error reporting:
1. Read the EDC_COUNTER2 register also to fetch error counts
   for all sub-blocks in SDMA.
2. SDMA RAS on Aldebaran suports single-bit uncorrectable errors
   only. So, report error count in UE count instead of CE count.
