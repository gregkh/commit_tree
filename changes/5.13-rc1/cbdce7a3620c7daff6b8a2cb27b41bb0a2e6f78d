ALSA: asihpi: fix comment syntax in file headers

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
There are files in sound/pci/asihpi which follow this syntax in their file
headers, i.e. start with '/**' like comments, which causes unexpected
warnings from kernel-doc.

E.g., running scripts/kernel-doc -none on sound/pci/asihpi/hpidspcd.h
causes this warning:
"warning: Cannot understand
 on line 4 - I thought it was a doc line"

Provide a simple fix by replacing the kernel-doc like comment syntax with
general format, i.e. "/*", to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
