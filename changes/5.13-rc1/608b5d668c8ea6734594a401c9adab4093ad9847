mm: page_owner: use kstrtobool() to parse bool option

I tried to use page_owner=1 for a while noticed too late it had no effect
as opposed to similar init_on_alloc=1 (these work).

Let's make them consistent.

The change decreses binary size slightly:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  12408     321      17   12746    31ca mm/page_owner.o.before
  12320     321      17   12658    3172 mm/page_owner.o.after
