net: hsr: check skb can contain struct hsr_ethhdr in fill_frame_info

Check at start of fill_frame_info that the MAC header in the supplied
skb is large enough to fit a struct hsr_ethhdr, as otherwise this is
not a valid HSR frame. If it is too small, return an error which will
then cause the callers to clean up the skb. Fixes a KMSAN-found
uninit-value bug reported by syzbot at:
