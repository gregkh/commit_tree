ice: Reimplement module reads used by ethtool

There was an excessive increment of the QSFP page, which is
now fixed. Additionally, this new update now reads 8 bytes
at a time and will retry each request if the module/bus is
busy.

Also, prevent reading from upper pages if module does not
support those pages.
