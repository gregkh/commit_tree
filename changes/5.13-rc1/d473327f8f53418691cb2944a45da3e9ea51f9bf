thermal/drivers/ti-soc-thermal/bandgap Remove unused variable 'val'

The function ti_bandgap_restore_ctxt() restores the context at resume
time. It checks if the sensor has a counter, reads the register but
does nothing with the value.

The block was probably omitted by the commit b87ea759a4cc.

Remove the unused variable as well as the block using it as we can
consider it as dead code.
