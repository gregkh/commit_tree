r8152: replace return with break for ram code speedup mode timeout

When the timeout occurs, we still have to run the following process
for releasing patch request. Otherwise, the PHY would keep no link.
Therefore, use break to stop the loop of loading firmware and
release the patch request rather than return the function directly.
