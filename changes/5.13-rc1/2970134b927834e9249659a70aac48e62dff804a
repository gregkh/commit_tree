mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix initialization of some SD cards for Intel BYT-based controllers

Bus power may control card power, but the full reset done by SDHCI at
initialization still may not reset the power, whereas a direct write to
SDHCI_POWER_CONTROL can. That might be needed to initialize correctly, if
the card was left powered on previously.
