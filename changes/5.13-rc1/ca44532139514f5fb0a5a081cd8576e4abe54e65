scsi: core: Make sure sdev->queue_depth is <= max(shost->can_queue, 1024)

Limit SCSI device's queue depth to max(host->can_queue, 1024) in
scsi_change_queue_depth(). 1024 is big enough for saturating current fast
SCSI LUN(SSD or RAID volume on multiple SSDs). Also single hardware queue
depth is usually enough for saturating single LUN because per-core
performance is often considered in storage design.

This patch is needed for replacing sdev->device_busy with sbitmap which has
to be pre-allocated with reasonable max depth.
