rcu/nocb: Forbid NOCB toggling on offline CPUs

It makes no sense to de-offload an offline CPU because that CPU will never
invoke any remaining callbacks.  It also makes little sense to offload an
offline CPU because any pending RCU callbacks were migrated when that CPU
went offline.  Yes, it is in theory possible to use a number of tricks
to permit offloading and deoffloading offline CPUs in certain cases, but
in practice it is far better to have the simple and deterministic rule
"Toggling the offload state of an offline CPU is forbidden".

For but one example, consider that an offloaded offline CPU might have
millions of callbacks queued.  Best to just say "no".

This commit therefore forbids toggling of the offloaded state of
offline CPUs.
