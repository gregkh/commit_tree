KVM: x86: Define new #PF SGX error code bit

Page faults that are signaled by the SGX Enclave Page Cache Map (EPCM),
as opposed to the traditional IA32/EPT page tables, set an SGX bit in
the error code to indicate that the #PF was induced by SGX.  KVM will
need to emulate this behavior as part of its trap-and-execute scheme for
virtualizing SGX Launch Control, e.g. to inject SGX-induced #PFs if
EINIT faults in the host, and to support live migration.
