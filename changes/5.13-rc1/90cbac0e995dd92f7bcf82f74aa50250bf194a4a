powerpc: Enable KFENCE for PPC32

Add architecture specific implementation details for KFENCE and enable
KFENCE for the ppc32 architecture. In particular, this implements the
required interface in <asm/kfence.h>.

KFENCE requires that attributes for pages from its memory pool can
individually be set. Therefore, force the Read/Write linear map to be
mapped at page granularity.
