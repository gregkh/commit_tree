arm64: kvm: Add standalone ticket spinlock implementation for use at hyp

We will soon need to synchronise multiple CPUs in the hyp text at EL2.
The qspinlock-based locking used by the host is overkill for this purpose
and relies on the kernel's "percpu" implementation for the MCS nodes.

Implement a simple ticket locking scheme based heavily on the code removed
by commit c11090474d70 ("arm64: locking: Replace ticket lock implementation
with qspinlock").
