usb: xhci-mtk: support to build xhci-mtk-hcd.ko

Currently xhci-hcd.ko building depends on USB_XHCI_MTK, this
is not flexible for some cases. For example:
USB_XHCI_HCD is y, and USB_XHCI_MTK is m, then we can't
implement extended functions if only update xhci-mtk.ko
This patch is used to remove the dependence.
