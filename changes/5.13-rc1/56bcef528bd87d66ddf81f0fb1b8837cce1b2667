octeontx2-af: Use npc_install_flow API for promisc and broadcast entries

Use npc_install_flow mailbox API for installing the default promisc
and broadcast match entries. Earlier these entries were installed
using low level npc_config_mcam_entry API, which does not store these
rules and is not available when the rules are dumped using debugfs.
Added chan_mask field to npc_install_flow_req to calculate channel
mask when channel count is greater than 1 and configure the channel
mask in entry kw_mask.
