scsi: smartpqi: Correct request leakage during reset operations

While failing queued I/Os in TMF path, there was a request leak and hence
stale entries in request pool with ref count being non-zero. In shutdown
path we have a BUG_ON to catch stuck I/O either in firmware or in the
driver. The stale requests caused a system crash. The I/O request pool
leakage also lead to a significant performance drop.
