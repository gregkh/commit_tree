MIPS: Loongson64: Use _CACHE_UNCACHED instead of _CACHE_UNCACHED_ACCELERATED

Loongson64 processors have a writecombine issue that maybe failed to
write back framebuffer used with ATI Radeon or AMD GPU at times, after
commit 8a08e50cee66 ("drm: Permit video-buffers writecombine mapping
for MIPS"), there exists some errors such as blurred screen and lockup,
and so on.

[   60.958721] radeon 0000:03:00.0: ring 0 stalled for more than 10079msec
[   60.965315] radeon 0000:03:00.0: GPU lockup (current fence id 0x0000000000000112 last fence id 0x000000000000011d on ring 0)
[   60.976525] radeon 0000:03:00.0: ring 3 stalled for more than 10086msec
[   60.983156] radeon 0000:03:00.0: GPU lockup (current fence id 0x0000000000000374 last fence id 0x00000000000003a8 on ring 3)

As discussed earlier [1], it might be better to disable writecombine
on the CPU detection side because the root cause is unknown now.

Actually, this patch is a temporary solution to just make it work well,
it is not a proper and final solution, I hope someone will have a better
solution to fix this issue in the future.
