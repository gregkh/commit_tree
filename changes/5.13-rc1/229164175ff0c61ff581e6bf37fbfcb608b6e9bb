x86/virtio: Have SEV guests enforce restricted virtio memory access

An SEV guest requires that virtio devices use the DMA API to allow the
hypervisor to successfully access guest memory as needed.

The VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 and VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM features tell virtio
to use the DMA API. Add arch_has_restricted_virtio_memory_access() for
x86, to fail the device probe if these features have not been set for the
device when running as an SEV guest.
