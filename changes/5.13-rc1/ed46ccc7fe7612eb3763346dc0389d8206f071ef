scsi: message: fusion: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having a
dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use "flexible array members"[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Also, this helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by
fixing the following warning:

drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c: In function ‘mptbase_reply’:
drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c:7747:62: warning: array subscript 1 is above array bounds of ‘U32[1]’ {aka ‘unsigned int[1]’} [-Warray-bounds]
 7747 |     ioc->events[idx].data[ii] = le32_to_cpu(pEventReply->Data[ii]);
