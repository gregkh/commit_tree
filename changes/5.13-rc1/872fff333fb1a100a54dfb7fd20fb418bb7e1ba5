nfc/fdp: remove unnecessary assignment and label

In function fdp_nci_patch_otp and fdp_nci_patch_ramï¼Œmany goto
out statements are used, and out label just return variable r.
in some places,just jump to the out label, and in other places,
assign a value to the variable r,then jump to the out label.
It is unnecessary, we just use return sentences to replace goto
sentences and delete out label.
