devcoredump: avoid -Wempty-body warnings

Cleaning out the last -Wempty-body warnings found some interesting
cases with empty macros, along with harmless warnings like this one:

drivers/base/devcoredump.c: In function 'dev_coredumpm':
drivers/base/devcoredump.c:297:56: error: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement [-Werror=empty-body]
  297 |                 /* nothing - symlink will be missing */;
      |                                                        ^
drivers/base/devcoredump.c:301:56: error: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement [-Werror=empty-body]
  301 |                 /* nothing - symlink will be missing */;
      |                                                        ^

Randy tried addressing this one before, and there were multiple
other ideas in that thread.

Add a runtime warning and code comment here.
