ethtool: ioctl: Fix out-of-bounds warning in store_link_ksettings_for_user()

Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:

net/ethtool/ioctl.c:492:2: warning: 'memcpy' offset [49, 84] from the object at 'link_usettings' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'base' with type 'struct ethtool_link_settings' at offset 0 [-Warray-bounds]

The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
some struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
memcpy(). This causes a legitimate compiler warning because memcpy()
overruns the length of &link_usettings.base. Fix this by directly
using &link_usettings and _from_ as destination and source addresses,
instead.

This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().
