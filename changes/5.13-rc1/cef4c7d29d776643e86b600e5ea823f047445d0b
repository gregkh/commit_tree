mm: remove lru_add_drain_all in alloc_contig_range

__alloc_contig_migrate_range already has lru_add_drain_all call via
migrate_prep.  It's necessary to move LRU taget pages into LRU list to be
able to isolated.  However, lru_add_drain_all call after
__alloc_contig_migrate_range is pointless since it has changed source page
freeing from putback_lru_pages to put_page[1].

This patch removes it.
