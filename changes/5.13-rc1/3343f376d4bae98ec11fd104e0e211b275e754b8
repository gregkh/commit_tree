usb: gadget: prevent a ternary sign expansion bug

The problem is that "req->actual" is a u32, "req->status" is an int, and
iocb->ki_complete() takes a long.  We would expect that a negative error
code in "req->status" would translate to a negative long value.

But what actually happens is that because "req->actual" is a u32, the
error codes is type promoted to a high positive value and then remains
a positive value when it is cast to long.  (No sign expansion).

We can fix this by casting "req->status" to long.
