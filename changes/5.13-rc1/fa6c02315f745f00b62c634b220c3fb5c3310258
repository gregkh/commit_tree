mm: huge_memory: a new debugfs interface for splitting THP tests

We did not have a direct user interface of splitting the compound page
backing a THP and there is no need unless we want to expose the THP
implementation details to users.  Make <debugfs>/split_huge_pages accept a
new command to do that.

By writing "<pid>,<vaddr_start>,<vaddr_end>" to
<debugfs>/split_huge_pages, THPs within the given virtual address range
from the process with the given pid are split. It is used to test
split_huge_page function. In addition, a selftest program is added to
tools/testing/selftests/vm to utilize the interface by splitting
PMD THPs and PTE-mapped THPs.

This does not change the old behavior, i.e., writing 1 to the interface
to split all THPs in the system.
