crypto: rng - fix crypto_rng_reset() refcounting when !CRYPTO_STATS

crypto_stats_get() is a no-op when the kernel is compiled without
CONFIG_CRYPTO_STATS, so pairing it with crypto_alg_put() unconditionally
(as crypto_rng_reset() does) is wrong.

Fix this by moving the call to crypto_stats_get() to just before the
actual algorithm operation which might need it.  This makes it always
paired with crypto_stats_rng_seed().
