wilc1000: fix a loop timeout condition

If the loop fails, the "while(trials--) {" loop will exit with "trials"
set to -1.  The test for that expects it to end with "trials" set to 0
so the warning message will not be printed.

Fix this by changing from a post-op to a pre-op.  This does mean that
we only make 99 attempts instead of 100 but that's okay.
