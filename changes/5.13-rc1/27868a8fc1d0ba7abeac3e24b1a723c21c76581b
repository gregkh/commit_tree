can: ucan: fix alignment constraints

struct ucan_message_in contains member with 4-byte alignment
but is itself marked as unaligned, which triggers a warning:

drivers/net/can/usb/ucan.c:249:1: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct ucan_message_in' is less than 4 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]

Mark the outer structure to have the same alignment as the inner
one.
