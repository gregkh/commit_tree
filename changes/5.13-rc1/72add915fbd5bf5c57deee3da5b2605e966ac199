KVM: VMX: Enable SGX virtualization for SGX1, SGX2 and LC

Enable SGX virtualization now that KVM has the VM-Exit handlers needed
to trap-and-execute ENCLS to ensure correctness and/or enforce the CPU
model exposed to the guest.  Add a KVM module param, "sgx", to allow an
admin to disable SGX virtualization independent of the kernel.

When supported in hardware and the kernel, advertise SGX1, SGX2 and SGX
LC to userspace via CPUID and wire up the ENCLS_EXITING bitmap based on
the guest's SGX capabilities, i.e. to allow ENCLS to be executed in an
SGX-enabled guest.  With the exception of the provision key, all SGX
attribute bits may be exposed to the guest.  Guest access to the
provision key, which is controlled via securityfs, will be added in a
future patch.

Note, KVM does not yet support exposing ENCLS_C leafs or ENCLV leafs.
