net: hns3: fix use-after-free issue for hclge_add_fd_entry_common()

When new rule state is TO_ADD or ACTIVE, and there is already a
rule with same location in the fd_rule_list, the new rule will
be freed after modifying the old rule. It may cause user-after-free
issue when access rule again in hclge_add_fd_entry_common().
