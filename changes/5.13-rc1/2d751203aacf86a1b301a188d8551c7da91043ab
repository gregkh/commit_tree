mtd: parsers: ofpart: limit parsing of deprecated DT syntax

For backward compatibility ofpart still supports the old syntax like:
spi-flash@0 {
	compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";
	reg = <0x0>;

	partition@0 {
		label = "bootloader";
		reg = <0x0 0x100000>;
	};
};
(without "partitions" subnode).

There is no reason however to support nested partitions without a clear
"compatible" string like:
partitions {
	compatible = "fixed-partitions";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

	partition@0 {
		label = "bootloader";
		reg = <0x0 0x100000>;

		partition@0 {
			label = "config";
			reg = <0x80000 0x80000>;
		};
	};
};
(we never officially supported or documented that).

Make sure ofpart doesn't attempt to parse above.
