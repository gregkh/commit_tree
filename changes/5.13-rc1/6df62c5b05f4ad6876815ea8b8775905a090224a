vfio: Make vfio_device_ops pass a 'struct vfio_device *' instead of 'void *'

This is the standard kernel pattern, the ops associated with a struct get
the struct pointer in for typesafety. The expected design is to use
container_of to cleanly go from the subsystem level type to the driver
level type without having any type erasure in a void *.
