scsi: lpfc: Fix unnecessary null check in lpfc_release_scsi_buf

lpfc_fcp_io_cmd_wqe_cmpl() is intended to mirror
lpfc_nvme_io_cmd_wqe_cmpl() for sli4 fcp completions. When the routine was
added, lpfc_fcp_io_cmd_wqe_cmpl() included a null pointer check for
phba. However, phba is definitely valid, being dereferenced by the calling
routine and used later in the routine itself.

Remove the unnecessary null check.
