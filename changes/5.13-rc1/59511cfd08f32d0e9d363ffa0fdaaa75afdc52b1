arm64: mm: use XN table mapping attributes for user/kernel mappings

As the kernel and user space page tables are strictly mutually exclusive
when it comes to executable permissions, we can set the UXN table attribute
on all table entries that are created while creating kernel mappings in the
swapper page tables, and the PXN table attribute on all table entries that
are created while creating user space mappings in user space page tables.

While at it, get rid of a redundant comment.
