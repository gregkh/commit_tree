ecryptfs: fix kernel panic with null dev_name

When mounting eCryptfs, a null "dev_name" argument to ecryptfs_mount()
causes a kernel panic if the parsed options are valid. The easiest way to
reproduce this is to call mount() from userspace with an existing
eCryptfs mount's options and a "source" argument of 0.

Error out if "dev_name" is null in ecryptfs_mount()
