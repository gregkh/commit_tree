media: atomisp: fix Wvisiblity warning

Some randconfig builds include ia_css_firmware.h without first
including linux/device.h:

drivers/staging/media/atomisp//pci/ia_css_firmware.h:52:29: error: declaration of 'struct device' will not be visible outside of this function [-Werror,-Wvisibility]

Add a forward declaration to avoid the warning.
