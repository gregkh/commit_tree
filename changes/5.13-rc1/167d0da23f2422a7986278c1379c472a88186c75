psci: use function_nocfi for cpu_resume

With CONFIG_CFI_CLANG, the compiler replaces function pointers with
jump table addresses, which results in __pa_symbol returning the
physical address of the jump table entry. As the jump table contains
an immediate jump to an EL1 virtual address, this typically won't
work as intended. Use function_nocfi to get the actual address of
cpu_resume.
