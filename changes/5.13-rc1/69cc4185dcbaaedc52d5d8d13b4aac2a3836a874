net/mlx5e: Use mlx5e_safe_switch_channels when channels are closed

This commit uses new functionality of mlx5e_safe_switch_channels
introduced by the previous commit to reduce the amount of repeating
similar code all over the driver.

It's very common in mlx5e to call mlx5e_safe_switch_channels when the
channels are open, but assign parameters and run hardware commands
manually when the channels are closed.

After the previous commit it's no longer needed to do such manual things
every time, so this commit removes unneeded code and relies on the new
functionality of mlx5e_safe_switch_channels. Some of the places are
refactored and simplified, where more complex flows are used to change
configuration on the fly, without recreating the channels (the logic is
rewritten in a more robust way, with a reset required by default and a
list of exceptions).
