staging: rtl8723bs: os_dep: Replace sprintf with scnprintf

The use of sprintf with format string here means that there is a risk
that the writes will go out of bounds, replace it with scnprintf.

In one block of the translate_scan function sprintf is only called once
(it's not being used to concatenate strings) so there is no need to keep
the pointer "p", remove it.
