ASoC: simple-card: fix possible uninitialized single_cpu local variable

The 'single_cpu' local variable is assigned by asoc_simple_parse_dai()
and later used in a asoc_simple_canonicalize_cpu() call, assuming the
entire function did not exit on errors.

However the first function returns 0 if passed device_node is NULL,
thus leaving the variable uninitialized and reporting success.

Addresses-Coverity: Uninitialized scalar variable
