can: netlink: move '=' operators back to previous line (checkpatch fix)

Fix the warning triggered by having an '=' at the beginning of the
line by moving it back to the previous line. Also replace all
indentations with a single space so that future entries can be more
easily added.

Extract of ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f drivers/net/can/dev/netlink.c:

CHECK: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
+       [IFLA_CAN_BITTIMING_CONST]
+                               = { .len = sizeof(struct can_bittiming_const) },

CHECK: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
+       [IFLA_CAN_DATA_BITTIMING]
+                               = { .len = sizeof(struct can_bittiming) },
