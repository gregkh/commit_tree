drm/amd/display: Populate dcn2.1 bounding box before state duplication

[Why]
If system is overclocked, only 1 bounding box state will
be sent by SMU. This results in an empty state being copied
for DML calculations causing black screens and corruption.

[How]
Fully populate bounding box before duplicating last state.
