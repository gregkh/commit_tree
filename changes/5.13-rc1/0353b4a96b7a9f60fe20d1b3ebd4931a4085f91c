net: bridge: when suppression is enabled exclude RARP packets

Recently we had an interop issue where RARP packets got suppressed with
bridge neigh suppression enabled, but the check in the code was meant to
suppress GARP. Exclude RARP packets from it which would allow some VMWare
setups to work, to quote the report:
"Those RARP packets usually get generated by vMware to notify physical
switches when vMotion occurs. vMware may use random sip/tip or just use
sip=tip=0. So the RARP packet sometimes get properly flooded by the vtep
and other times get dropped by the logic"
