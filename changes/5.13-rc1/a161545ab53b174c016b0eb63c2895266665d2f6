x86/cpufeatures: Enumerate Intel Hybrid Technology feature bit

Add feature enumeration to identify a processor with Intel Hybrid
Technology: one in which CPUs of more than one type are the same package.
On a hybrid processor, all CPUs support the same homogeneous (i.e.,
symmetric) instruction set. All CPUs enumerate the same features in CPUID.
Thus, software (user space and kernel) can run and migrate to any CPU in
the system as well as utilize any of the enumerated features without any
change or special provisions. The main difference among CPUs in a hybrid
processor are power and performance properties.
