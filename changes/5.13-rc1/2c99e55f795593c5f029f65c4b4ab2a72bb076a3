PCI: tegra: Convert to MSI domains

In anticipation of the removal of the msi_controller structure, convert
the Tegra host controller driver to MSI domains.

We end-up with the usual two domain structure, the top one being a
generic PCI/MSI domain, the bottom one being Tegra-specific and handling
the actual HW interrupt allocation.

While at it, convert the normal interrupt handler to a chained handler,
handle the controller's MSI IRQ edge triggered, support multiple MSIs
per device and use the AFI_MSI_EN_VEC* registers to provide MSI masking.
