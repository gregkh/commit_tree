vfio/pci: Replace uses of vfio_device_data() with container_of

This tidies a few confused places that think they can have a refcount on
the vfio_device but the device_data could be NULL, that isn't possible by
design.

Most of the change falls out when struct vfio_devices is updated to just
store the struct vfio_pci_device itself. This wasn't possible before
because there was no easy way to get from the 'struct vfio_pci_device' to
the 'struct vfio_device' to put back the refcount.
