locking/ww_mutex: Remove DEFINE_WW_MUTEX() macro

The current DEFINE_WW_MUTEX() macro fails to properly set up the lockdep
key of the ww_mutexes causing potential circular locking dependency
splat. Though it is possible to add more macro magic to make it work,
but the result is rather ugly.

Since locktorture was the only user of DEFINE_WW_MUTEX() and the
previous commit has just removed its use. It is easier to just remove
the macro to force future users of ww_mutexes to use ww_mutex_init()
for initialization.
