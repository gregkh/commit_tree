thunderbolt: Allow multiple DMA tunnels over a single XDomain connection

Currently we have had an artificial limitation of a single DMA tunnel
per XDomain connection. However, hardware wise there is no such limit
and software based connection manager can take advantage of all the DMA
rings available on the host to establish tunnels.

For this reason make the tb_xdomain_[enable|disable]_paths() to take the
DMA ring and HopID as parameter instead of storing them in the struct
tb_xdomain. We also add API functions to allocate input and output
HopIDs of the XDomain connection that the service drivers can use
instead of hard-coding.

Also convert the two existing service drivers over to this API.
