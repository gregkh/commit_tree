soundwire: Intel: introduce DMI quirks for HP Spectre x360 Convertible

HP Spectre x360 Convertible devices expose invalid _ADR fields in the
DSDT, which prevents codec drivers from probing. A possible solution
is to override the DSDT, but that's just too painful for users.

This patch suggests a simple DMI-based quirk to remap the existing
invalid ADR information into valid ones.
