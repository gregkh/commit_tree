f2fs: check if swapfile is section-alligned

If the swapfile isn't created by pin and fallocate, it can't be
guaranteed section-aligned, so it may be selected by f2fs gc. When
gc_pin_file_threshold is reached, the address of swapfile may change,
but won't be synchronized to swap_extent, so swap will write to wrong
address, which will cause data corruption.
