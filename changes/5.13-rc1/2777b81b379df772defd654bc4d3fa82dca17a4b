perf annotate: Show full source location with 'l' hotkey

Right now, when Line numbers are displayed, one can't easily find a
source file that the line corresponds to.

When a source line is selected and 'l' is pressed, full source file
location is displayed in perf UI footer line. The hotkey works only for
source code lines.
