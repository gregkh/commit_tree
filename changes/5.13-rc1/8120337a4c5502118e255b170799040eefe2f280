KVM: x86/mmu: Stop using software available bits to denote MMIO SPTEs

Stop tagging MMIO SPTEs with specific available bits and instead detect
MMIO SPTEs by checking for their unique SPTE value.  The value is
guaranteed to be unique on shadow paging and NPT as setting reserved
physical address bits on any other type of SPTE would consistute a KVM
bug.  Ditto for EPT, as creating a WX non-MMIO would also be a bug.

Note, this approach is also future-compatibile with TDX, which will need
to reflect MMIO EPT violations as #VEs into the guest.  To create an EPT
violation instead of a misconfig, TDX EPTs will need to have RWX=0,  But,
MMIO SPTEs will also be the only case where KVM clears SUPPRESS_VE, so
MMIO SPTEs will still be guaranteed to have a unique value within a given
MMU context.

The main motivation is to make it easier to reason about which types of
SPTEs use which available bits.  As a happy side effect, this frees up
two more bits for storing the MMIO generation.
