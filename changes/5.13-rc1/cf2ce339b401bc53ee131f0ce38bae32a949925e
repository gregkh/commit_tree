mld: get rid of inet6_dev->mc_lock

The purpose of mc_lock is to protect inet6_dev->mc_tomb.
But mc_tomb is already protected by RTNL and all functions,
which manipulate mc_tomb are called under RTNL.
So, mc_lock is not needed.
Furthermore, it is spinlock so the critical section is atomic.
In order to reduce atomic context, it should be removed.
