f2fs: allow to change discard policy based on cached discard cmds

With the default DPOLICY_BG discard thread is ioaware, which prevents
the discard thread from issuing the discard commands. On low RAM setups,
it is observed that these discard commands in the cache are consuming
high memory. This patch aims to relax the memory pressure on the system
due to f2fs pending discard cmds by changing the policy to DPOLICY_FORCE
based on the nm_i->ram_thresh configured.
