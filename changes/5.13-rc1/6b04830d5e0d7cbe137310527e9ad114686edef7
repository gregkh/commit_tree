net: enetc: rename the buffer reuse helpers

enetc_put_xdp_buff has nothing to do with XDP, frankly, it is just a
helper to populate the recycle end of the shadow RX BD ring
(next_to_alloc) with a given buffer.

On the other hand, enetc_put_rx_buff plays more tricks than its name
would suggest.

So let's rename enetc_put_rx_buff into enetc_flip_rx_buff to reflect the
half-page buffer reuse tricks that it employs, and enetc_put_xdp_buff
into enetc_put_rx_buff which suggests a more garden-variety operation.
