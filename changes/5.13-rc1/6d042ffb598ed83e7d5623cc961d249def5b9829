io_uring: Check current->io_uring in io_uring_cancel_sqpoll

syzkaller identified KASAN: null-ptr-deref Write in
io_uring_cancel_sqpoll.

io_uring_cancel_sqpoll is called by io_sq_thread before calling
io_uring_alloc_task_context. This leads to current->io_uring being NULL.
io_uring_cancel_sqpoll should not have to deal with threads where
current->io_uring is NULL.

In order to cast a wider safety net, perform input sanitisation directly
in io_uring_cancel_sqpoll and return for NULL value of current->io_uring.
This is safe since if current->io_uring isn't set, then there's no way
for the task to have submitted any requests.
