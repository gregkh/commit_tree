pinctrl: core: Set ret to 0 when group is skipped

Static analyzer tool found that the ret variable is not initialized but
code expects ret value >=0 when pinconf is skipped in the first pinmux
loop. The same expectation is for pinmux in a pinconf loop.
That's why initialize ret to 0 to avoid uninitialized ret value in first
loop or reusing ret value from first loop in second.
