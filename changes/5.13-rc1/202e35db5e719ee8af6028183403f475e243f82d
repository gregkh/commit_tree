mm/vmscan: replace implicit RECLAIM_ZONE checks with explicit checks

RECLAIM_ZONE was assumed to be unused because it was never explicitly
used in the kernel.  However, there were a number of places where it was
checked implicitly by checking 'node_reclaim_mode' for a zero value.

These zero checks are not great because it is not obvious what a zero
mode *means* in the code.  Replace them with a helper which makes it
more obvious: node_reclaim_enabled().

This helper also provides a handy place to explicitly check the
RECLAIM_ZONE bit itself.  Check it explicitly there to make it more
obvious where the bit can affect behavior.

This should have no functional impact.
