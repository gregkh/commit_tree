ARM: OMAP2+: Make symbol 'pdata_quirks_init_clocks' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

arch/arm/mach-omap2/pdata-quirks.c:578:1: warning:
 symbol 'pdata_quirks_init_clocks' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of pdata-quirks.c, so this
commit marks it static.

Fixes: a15de032a72d ("ARM: OMAP2+: Init both prm and prcm nodes early for clocks")
