usb: dwc3: gadget: Remove invalid low-speed setting

None of the DWC_usb3x IPs (and all their versions) supports low-speed
setting in device mode. In the early days, our "Early Adopter Edition"
DWC_usb3 databook shows that the controller may be configured to operate
in low-speed, but it was revised on release. Let's remove this invalid
speed setting to avoid any confusion.
