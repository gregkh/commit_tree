soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Validate that p_filesz < p_memsz

The code validates that segments of p_memsz bytes of a segment will fit
in the provided memory region, but does not validate that p_filesz bytes
will, which means that an incorrectly crafted ELF header might write
beyond the provided memory region.
