macintosh/via-pmu: Fix build warning

Now that __fake_sleep is static, we get a warning about it being unused
in some configurations:

  drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:190:12: warning: '__fake_sleep' defined but not used
    190 | static int __fake_sleep;

Move it inside the ifdef where it's used to avoid the warning.
