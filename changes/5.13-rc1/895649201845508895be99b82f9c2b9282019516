net/mlx5e: Restrict usage of mlx5e_priv in params logic functions

Do not use generic struct mlx5e_priv as a parameter to param
functions, as it is too generic. All calculations of the channel's
param should be mainly based on struct mlx5_core_dev and
struct mlx5e_params. Additional info can be explicitly passed.
