media: dt-bindings: media: nxp,imx7-mipi-csi2: Drop the reset-names property

The reset-names property is incorrect, as it references the reset of the
MIPI D-PHY master, which is used by the DSI controller. Fixing the
property name would create backward-compatibility issues. As the device
has a single reset, we can instead drop reset-names completely, which
also simplifies the binding.

Fix the example accordingly to use the correct reset.
