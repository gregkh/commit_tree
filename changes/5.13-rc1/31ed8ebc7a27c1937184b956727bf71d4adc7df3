spi: Make error handling of gpiod_count() call cleaner

Each time we call spi_get_gpio_descs() the num_chipselect is overwritten
either by new value or by the old one. This is an extra operation in case
gpiod_count() returns an error. Besides that it slashes the error handling
of gpiod_count().

Refactor the code to make error handling of gpiod_count() call cleaner.

Note, that gpiod_count() never returns 0, take this into account as well.
