arm64: Explicitly document boot requirements for SVE

We do not currently document the requirements for configuration of the
SVE system registers when booting the kernel, let's do so for completeness.

We don't have a hard requirement that the vector lengths configured on
different CPUs on initial boot be consistent since we have logic to
constrain to the minimum supported value but we will reject any late CPUs
which can't support the current maximum and introducing the concept of
late CPUs seemed more complex than was useful so we require that all CPUs
use the same value.
