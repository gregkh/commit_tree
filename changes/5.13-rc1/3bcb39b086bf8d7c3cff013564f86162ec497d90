cifs: have ->mkdir() handle race with another client sanely

if we have mkdir request reported successful *and* simulating lookup
gets us a non-directory (which is possible if another client has
managed to get rmdir and create in between), the sane action is not
to mangle ->i_mode of non-directory inode to S_IFDIR | mode, it's
"report success and return with dentry negative unhashed" - that
way the next lookup will do the right thing.
