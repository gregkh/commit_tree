serial: stm32: defer sysrq processing

Use the uart_unlock_and_check_sysrq() helper to defer sysrq processing
until receive processing is done and the port lock has been released.

This allows cleaning up the console_write() implementation by not having
to work around the recursive sysrq case (by dropping locking completely)
and also makes the console code work with PREEMPT_RT by no longer
relying on local_irq_save().
