ice: Check FDIR program status for AVF

Enable returning FDIR completion status by checking the
ctrl_vsi Rx queue descriptor value.

To enable returning FDIR completion status from ctrl_vsi Rx queue,
COMP_Queue and COMP_Report of FDIR filter programming descriptor
needs to be properly configured. After program request sent to ctrl_vsi
Tx queue, ctrl_vsi Rx queue interrupt will be triggered and
completion status will be returned.

Driver will first issue request in ice_vc_fdir_add_fltr(), then
pass FDIR context to the background task in interrupt service routine
ice_vc_fdir_irq_handler() and finally deal with them in
ice_flush_fdir_ctx(). ice_flush_fdir_ctx() will check the descriptor's
value, fdir context, and then send back virtual channel message to VF
by calling ice_vc_add_fdir_fltr_post(). An additional timer will be
setup in case of hardware interrupt timeout.
