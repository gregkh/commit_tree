tools: iio: make iioutils_get_type() private in iio_utils

This is a bit of a tidy-up, but also helps with extending the
iioutils_get_type() function a bit, as we don't need to use it outside of
the iio_utils.c file. So, we'll need to update it only in one place.

With this change, the 'unsigned' types are updated to 'unsigned int' in the
iioutils_get_type() function definition.
