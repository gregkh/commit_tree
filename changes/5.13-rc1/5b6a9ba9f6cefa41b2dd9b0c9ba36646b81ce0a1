drm/i915: Don't check tc_mode unless dealing with a TC PHY

We shouldn't really trust tc_mode on non-TC PHYs since we never
initialize it explicitly. So let's check for the PHY type first.
Fortunately TC_PORT_TBT_ALT happens to be zero so I don't think
there's an actual bug here, just a possibility for a future one
if someone rearranges the enum values.
