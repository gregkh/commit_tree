dt-bindings: gpio: Binding for Realtek Otto GPIO

Add a binding description for Realtek's GPIO controller found on several
of their MIPS-based SoCs (codenamed Otto), such as the RTL838x and
RTL839x series of switch SoCs.

A fallback binding 'realtek,otto-gpio' is provided for cases where the
actual port ordering is not known yet, and enabling the interrupt
controller may result in uncaught interrupts.
