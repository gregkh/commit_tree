usb: typec: tcpm: Wait for vbus discharge to VSAFE0V before toggling

When vbus auto discharge is enabled, TCPM can sometimes be faster than
the TCPC i.e. TCPM can go ahead and move the port to unattached state
(involves disabling vbus auto discharge) before TCPC could effectively
discharge vbus to VSAFE0V. This leaves vbus with residual charge and
increases the decay time which prevents tsafe0v from being met.
This change makes TCPM waits for a maximum of tSafe0V(max) for vbus
to discharge to VSAFE0V before transitioning to unattached state
and re-enable toggling. If vbus discharges to vsafe0v sooner, then,
transition to unattached state
happens right away.

Also, while in SNK_READY, when auto discharge is enabled, drive
disconnect based on vbus turning off instead of Rp disappearing on
CC pins. Rp disappearing on CC pins is almost instanteous compared
to vbus decay.
