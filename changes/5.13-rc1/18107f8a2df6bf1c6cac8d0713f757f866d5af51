arm64: Support execute-only permissions with Enhanced PAN

Enhanced Privileged Access Never (EPAN) allows Privileged Access Never
to be used with Execute-only mappings.

Absence of such support was a reason for 24cecc377463 ("arm64: Revert
support for execute-only user mappings"). Thus now it can be revisited
and re-enabled.
