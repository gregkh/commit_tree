bpf: Compute data_end dynamically with JIT code

Currently, we compute ->data_end with a compile-time constant
offset of skb. But as Jakub pointed out, we can actually compute
it in eBPF JIT code at run-time, so that we can competely get
rid of ->data_end. This is similar to skb_shinfo(skb) computation
in bpf_convert_shinfo_access().
