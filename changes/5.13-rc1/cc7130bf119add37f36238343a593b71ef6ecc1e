powerpc/iommu: Annotate nested lock for lockdep

The IOMMU table is divided into pools for concurrent mappings and each
pool has a separate spinlock. When taking the ownership of an IOMMU group
to pass through a device to a VM, we lock these spinlocks which triggers
a false negative warning in lockdep (below).

This fixes it by annotating the large pool's spinlock as a nest lock
which makes lockdep not complaining when locking nested locks if
the nest lock is locked already.
