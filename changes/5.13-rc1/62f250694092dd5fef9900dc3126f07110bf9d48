cpu/hotplug: CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU failure exception

The atomic states (between CPUHP_AP_IDLE_DEAD and CPUHP_AP_ONLINE) are
triggered by the CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU step. If the latter fails, no atomic
state can be rolled back.

DEAD callbacks too can't fail and disallow recovery. As a consequence,
during hotunplug, the fail injection interface should prohibit all states
from CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU to CPUHP_ONLINE.
