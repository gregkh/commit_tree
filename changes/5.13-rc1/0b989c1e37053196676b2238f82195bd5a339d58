net/mlx5: Add dynamic MSI-X capabilities bits

These new fields declare the number of MSI-X vectors that is possible to
allocate on the VF through PF configuration.

Value must be in range defined by min_dynamic_vf_msix_table_size and
max_dynamic_vf_msix_table_size.

The driver should continue to query its MSI-X table through PCI
configuration header.
