powerpc/signal32: Remove ifdefery in middle of if/else in sigreturn()

In the same spirit as commit f1cf4f93de2f ("powerpc/signal32: Remove
ifdefery in middle of if/else")

MSR_TM_ACTIVE() is always defined and returns always 0 when
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM is not selected, so the awful
ifdefery in the middle of an if/else can be removed.

Make 'msr_hi' a 'long long' to avoid build failure on PPC32
due to the 32 bits left shift.
