drm/udl: Move vmap out of commit tail

Vmap operations may acquire the dmabuf reservation lock, which is not
allowed within atomic commit-tail functions. Therefore move vmap and
vunmap from the damage handler into prepare_fb and cleanup_fb callbacks.

The mapping is provided as GEM shadow-buffered plane. The functions in
the commit tail use the pre-established mapping for damage handling.
