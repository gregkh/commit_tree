serial: omap: fix rs485 half-duplex filtering

Data received during half-duplex transmission must be filtered.
If the target device responds quickly, emptying the FIFO at the end of
the transmission can erase not only the echo characters but also part of
the response message.
By keeping the receive interrupt enabled even during transmission, it
allows you to filter each echo character and only in a number equal to
those transmitted.
The issue was generated by a target device that started responding
240us later having received a request in communication at 115200bps.
Sometimes, some messages received by the target were missing some of the
first bytes.
