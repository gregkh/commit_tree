io_uring: don't fail overflow on in_idle

As CQE overflows are now untied from requests and so don't hold any
ref, we don't need to handle exiting/exec'ing cases there anymore.
Moreover, it's much nicer in regards to userspace to save overflowed
CQEs whenever possible, so remove failing on in_idle.
