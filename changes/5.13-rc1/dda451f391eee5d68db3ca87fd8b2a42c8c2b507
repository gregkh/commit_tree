x86/cacheinfo: Remove unneeded dead-store initialization

$ make CC=clang clang-analyzer

(needs clang-tidy installed on the system too)

on x86_64 defconfig triggers:

  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cacheinfo.c:880:24: warning: Value stored to 'this_cpu_ci' \
	  during its initialization is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
        struct cpu_cacheinfo *this_cpu_ci = get_cpu_cacheinfo(cpu);
                              ^
  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cacheinfo.c:880:24: note: Value stored to 'this_cpu_ci' \
	during its initialization is never read

So simply remove this unneeded dead-store initialization.

As compilers will detect this unneeded assignment and optimize this
anyway the resulting object code is identical before and after this
change.

No functional change. No change to object code.
