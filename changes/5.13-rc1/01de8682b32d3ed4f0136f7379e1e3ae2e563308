KVM: x86: Add reverse-CPUID lookup support for scattered SGX features

Define a new KVM-only feature word for advertising and querying SGX
sub-features in CPUID.0x12.0x0.EAX.  Because SGX1 and SGX2 are scattered
in the kernel's feature word, they need to be translated so that the
bit numbers match those of hardware.
