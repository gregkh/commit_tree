bpf: Add a bpf_snprintf helper

The implementation takes inspiration from the existing bpf_trace_printk
helper but there are a few differences:

To allow for a large number of format-specifiers, parameters are
provided in an array, like in bpf_seq_printf.

Because the output string takes two arguments and the array of
parameters also takes two arguments, the format string needs to fit in
one argument. Thankfully, ARG_PTR_TO_CONST_STR is guaranteed to point to
a zero-terminated read-only map so we don't need a format string length
arg.

Because the format-string is known at verification time, we also do
a first pass of format string validation in the verifier logic. This
makes debugging easier.
