KVM: arm64: Support PREL/PLT relocs in EL2 code

gen-hyprel tool parses object files of the EL2 portion of KVM
and generates runtime relocation data. While only filtering for
R_AARCH64_ABS64 relocations in the input object files, it has an
allow-list of relocation types that are used for relative
addressing. Other, unexpected, relocation types are rejected and
cause the build to fail.

This allow-list did not include the position-relative relocation
types R_AARCH64_PREL64/32/16 and the recently introduced _PLT32.
While not seen used by toolchains in the wild, add them to the
allow-list for completeness.
