drm/gma500: Remove in_atomic() usage.

The driver is using msleep() if it is safe to use based on in_atomic().
This is not needed this macro is only used from
i2c_algorithm::master_xfer() which is always invoked from preemptible
context.

Remove in_atomic() because it is superfluous. Remove wait_for_atomic()
because it has no users.
