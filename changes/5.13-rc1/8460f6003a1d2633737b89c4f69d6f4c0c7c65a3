usb: sl811-hcd: improve misleading indentation

gcc-11 now warns about a confusingly indented code block:

drivers/usb/host/sl811-hcd.c: In function ‘sl811h_hub_control’:
drivers/usb/host/sl811-hcd.c:1291:9: error: this ‘if’ clause does not guard... [-Werror=misleading-indentation]
 1291 |         if (*(u16*)(buf+2))     /* only if wPortChange is interesting */
      |         ^~
drivers/usb/host/sl811-hcd.c:1295:17: note: ...this statement, but the latter is misleadingly indented as if it were guarded by the ‘if’
 1295 |                 break;

Rewrite this to use a single if() block with the __is_defined() macro.
