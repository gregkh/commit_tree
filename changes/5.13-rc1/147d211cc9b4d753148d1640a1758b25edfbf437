media: cedrus: Fix H265 status definitions

Some of the H265 status flags are wrong. Redefine them to corespond to
Allwinner CedarC open source userspace library. Only one of these flags
is actually used and new value also matches value used in libvdpau-sunxi
library, which is proven to be working.

Note that wrong (old) value in right circumstances (in combination with
another H265 decoding bug) causes driver lock up. With this fix decoding
is still broken (green output) but at least driver doesn't lock up.
