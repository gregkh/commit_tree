selftests/bpf: Fix test_attach_probe for powerpc uprobes

When testing uprobes we the test gets GEP (Global Entry Point)
address from kallsyms, but then the function is called locally
so the uprobe is not triggered.

Fixing this by adjusting the address to LEP (Local Entry Point)
for powerpc arch plus instruction check stolen from ppc_function_entry
function pointed out and explained by Michael and Naveen.
