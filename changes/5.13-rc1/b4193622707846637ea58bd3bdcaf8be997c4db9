dt-bindings: bcm4329-fmac: add optional brcm,ccode-map

Add optional brcm,ccode-map property to support translation from ISO3166
country code to brcmfmac firmware country code and revision.

The country revision is needed because the RF parameters that provide
regulatory compliance are tweaked per platform/customer.  So depending
on the RF path tight to the chip, certain country revision needs to be
specified.  As such they could be seen as device specific calibration
data which is a good fit into device tree.
