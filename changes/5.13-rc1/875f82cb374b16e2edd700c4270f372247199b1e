Documentation/submitting-patches: Extend commit message layout description

Add more blurb about the level of detail that should be contained in a
patch's commit message. Extend and make more explicit what text should
be added under the --- line. Extend examples and split into more easily
palatable paragraphs.

This has been partially carved out from a tip subsystem handbook
patchset by Thomas Gleixner:

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181107171010.421878737@linutronix.de

and incorporates follow-on comments.
