vhost/vdpa: Remove the restriction that only supports virtio-net devices

Since the config checks are done by the vDPA drivers, we can remove the
virtio-net restriction and we should be able to support all kinds of
virtio devices.

<linux/virtio_net.h> is not needed anymore, but we need to include
<linux/slab.h> to avoid compilation failures.
