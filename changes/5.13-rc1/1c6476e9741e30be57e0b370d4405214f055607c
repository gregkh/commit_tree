oid_registry: Add TCG defined OIDS for TPM keys

The TCG has defined an OID prefix "2.23.133.10.1" for the various TPM
key uses.  We've defined three of the available numbers:

2.23.133.10.1.3 TPM Loadable key.  This is an asymmetric key (Usually
		RSA2048 or Elliptic Curve) which can be imported by a
		TPM2_Load() operation.

2.23.133.10.1.4 TPM Importable Key.  This is an asymmetric key (Usually
		RSA2048 or Elliptic Curve) which can be imported by a
		TPM2_Import() operation.

Both loadable and importable keys are specific to a given TPM, the
difference is that a loadable key is wrapped with the symmetric
secret, so must have been created by the TPM itself.  An importable
key is wrapped with a DH shared secret, and may be created without
access to the TPM provided you know the public part of the parent key.

2.23.133.10.1.5 TPM Sealed Data.  This is a set of data (up to 128
		bytes) which is sealed by the TPM.  It usually
		represents a symmetric key and must be unsealed before
		use.

The ASN.1 binary key form starts of with this OID as the first element
of a sequence, giving the binary form a unique recognizable identity
marker regardless of encoding.
