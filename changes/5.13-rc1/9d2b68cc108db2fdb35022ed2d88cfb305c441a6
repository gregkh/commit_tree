net: enetc: add support for XDP_REDIRECT

The driver implementation of the XDP_REDIRECT action reuses parts from
XDP_TX, most notably the enetc_xdp_tx function which transmits an array
of TX software BDs. Only this time, the buffers don't have DMA mappings,
we need to create them.

When a BPF program reaches the XDP_REDIRECT verdict for a frame, we can
employ the same buffer reuse strategy as for the normal processing path
and for XDP_PASS: we can flip to the other page half and seed that to
the RX ring.

Note that scatter/gather support is there, but disabled due to lack of
multi-buffer support in XDP (which is added by this series):
