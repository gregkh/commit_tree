drm/i915: Shrink the size of intel_remapped_plane_info struct

Save some place in the GTT VMAs by using a u16 instead of unsigned int
to store the view dimensions. The maximum FB stride is 256kB which is
4096 tiles in the worst case (yf-tiles), the maximum FB height is 16k
pixels, which is 16384 tiles in the worst case (linear 4x1 tiled FB).

v2:
- Fix worst case tile height formula in commit log. (Ville)
- Add an assign_chk_ovf helper to simplify the related assignments.
v3:
- Enclose params of the assign_chk_ovf macro in parentheses.
