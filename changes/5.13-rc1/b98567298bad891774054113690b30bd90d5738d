perf/x86: Remove temporary pmu assignment in event_init

The temporary pmu assignment in event_init is unnecessary.

The assignment was introduced by commit 8113070d6639 ("perf_events:
Add fast-path to the rescheduling code"). At that time, event->pmu is
not assigned yet when initializing an event. The assignment is required.
However, from commit 7e5b2a01d2ca ("perf: provide PMU when initing
events"), the event->pmu is provided before event_init is invoked.
The temporary pmu assignment in event_init should be removed.
