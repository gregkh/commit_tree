riscv: vdso: fix and clean-up Makefile

Running "make" on an already compiled kernel tree will rebuild the
kernel even without any modifications:

  CALL    linux/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  CALL    linux/scripts/atomic/check-atomics.sh
  CHK     include/generated/compile.h
  SO2S    arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.S
  AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.o
  AR      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/built-in.a
  AR      arch/riscv/kernel/built-in.a
  AR      arch/riscv/built-in.a
  GEN     .version
  CHK     include/generated/compile.h
  UPD     include/generated/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  AR      init/built-in.a
  LD      vmlinux.o

The reason is "Any target that utilizes if_changed must be listed in
$(targets), otherwise the command line check will fail, and the target
will always be built" as explained by Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst

Fix this build bug by adding vdso-syms.S to $(targets)

At the same time, there are two trivial clean up modifications:

- the vdso-dummy.o is not needed any more after so remove it.

- vdso.lds is a generated file, so it should be prefixed with
  $(obj)/ instead of $(src)/
