nvme: rename nvme_init_identify()

This is a prep patch so that we can move the identify data structure
related code initialization from nvme_init_identify() into a helper.

Rename the function nvmet_init_identify() to nvmet_init_ctrl_finish().

Next patch will move the nvme_id_ctrl related initialization from newly
renamed function nvme_init_ctrl_finish() into the nvme_init_identify()
helper.
