tcp: Rename bictcp function prefix to cubictcp

The cubic functions in tcp_cubic.c are using the bictcp prefix as
in tcp_bic.c.  This patch gives it the proper name cubictcp
because the later patch will allow the bpf prog to directly
call the cubictcp implementation.  Renaming them will avoid
the name collision when trying to find the intended
one to call during bpf prog load time.
