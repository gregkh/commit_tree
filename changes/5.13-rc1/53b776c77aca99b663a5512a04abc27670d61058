netfs: Miscellaneous fixes

Fix some miscellaneous things in the new netfs lib[1]:

 (1) The kerneldoc for netfs_readpage() shouldn't say netfs_page().

 (2) netfs_readpage() can get an integer overflow on 32-bit when it
     multiplies page_index(page) by PAGE_SIZE.  It should use
     page_file_offset() instead.

 (3) netfs_write_begin() should use page_offset() to avoid the same
     overflow.

Note that netfs_readpage() needs to use page_file_offset() rather than
page_offset() as it may see swap-over-NFS.
