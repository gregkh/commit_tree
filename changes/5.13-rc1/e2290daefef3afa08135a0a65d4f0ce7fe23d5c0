ASoC: soc-core: fix always-false condition

cppcheck warning:

sound/soc/soc-core.c:2784:6: style: Condition '!num_routes' is always
false [knownConditionTrueFalse]
 if (!num_routes) {
     ^
sound/soc/soc-core.c:2777:17: note: Assuming that condition
'num_routes<0' is not redundant
 if (num_routes < 0 || num_routes & 1) {
                ^
sound/soc/soc-core.c:2783:2: note: Compound assignment '/=', assigned
value is 0
 num_routes /= 2;

The documentation for of_property_count_string reads

"
 * Returns the number of strings on
 * success, -EINVAL if the property does not exist, -ENODATA if property
 * does not have a value, and -EILSEQ if the string is not null-terminated
 * within the length of the property data.
"

Since the case for num_routes == 0 is not possible, let's remove this
test.
