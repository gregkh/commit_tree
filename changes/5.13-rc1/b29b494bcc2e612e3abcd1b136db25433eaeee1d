usb: dwc2: Reset DEVADDR after exiting gadget hibernation.

Initially resetting device address was done in dwc2_hsotg_irq()
interrupt handler. However, when core is hibernated USB RESET
is not handled in dwc2_hsotg_irq() handler, instead USB RESET
interrupt is handled in dwc2_handle_gpwrdn_intr() handler.

- Added reset device address to zero when core exits from gadget
  hibernation.
