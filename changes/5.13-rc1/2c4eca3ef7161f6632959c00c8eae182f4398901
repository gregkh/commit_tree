net: bridge: switchdev: include local flag in FDB notifications

As explained in bugfix commit 6ab4c3117aec ("net: bridge: don't notify
switchdev for local FDB addresses") as well as in this discussion:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210117193009.io3nungdwuzmo5f7@skbuf/

the switchdev notifiers for FDB entries managed to have a zero-day bug,
which was that drivers would not know what to do with local FDB entries,
because they were not told that they are local. The bug fix was to
simply not notify them of those addresses.

Let us now add the 'is_local' bit to bridge FDB entries, and make all
drivers ignore these entries by their own choice.
