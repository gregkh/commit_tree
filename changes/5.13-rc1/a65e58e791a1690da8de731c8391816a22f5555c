fs: document and rename fsid helpers

Vivek pointed out that the fs{g,u}id_into_mnt() naming scheme can be
misleading as it could be understood as implying they do the exact same
thing as i_{g,u}id_into_mnt(). The original motivation for this naming
scheme was to signal to callers that the helpers will always take care
to map the k{g,u}id such that the ownership is expressed in terms of the
mnt_users.
Get rid of the confusion by renaming those helpers to something more
sensible. Al suggested mapped_fs{g,u}id() which seems a really good fit.
Usually filesystems don't need to bother with these helpers directly
only in some cases where they allocate objects that carry {g,u}ids which
are either filesystem specific (e.g. xfs quota objects) or don't have a
clean set of helpers as inodes have.
