rtl8xxxu: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix
multiple warnings by replacing /* fall through */ comments with
the new pseudo-keyword macro fallthrough; instead of letting the
code fall through to the next case.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings.
