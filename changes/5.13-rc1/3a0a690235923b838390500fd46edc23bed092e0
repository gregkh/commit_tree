io_uring: move inflight un-tracking into cleanup

REQ_F_INFLIGHT deaccounting doesn't do any spinlocking or resource
freeing anymore, so it's safe to move it into the normal cleanup flow,
i.e. into io_clean_op(), so making it cleaner.

Also move io_req_needs_clean() to be first in io_dismantle_req() so it
doesn't reload req->flags.
