clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: remove .set_parent method for CPU PM clock

Remove the .set_parent method in clk_pm_cpu_ops.

This method was supposed to be needed by the armada-37xx-cpufreq driver,
but was never actually called due to wrong assumptions in the cpufreq
driver. After this was fixed in the cpufreq driver, this method is not
needed anymore.
