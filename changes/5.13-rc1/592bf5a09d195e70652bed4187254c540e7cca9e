can: peak_usb: peak_usb_probe(): make use of driver_info

There's no need to iterate over all supported adapters to find the
struct peak_usb_adapter that describes the currently probed devices's
capabilities. The driver core gives us the information for free, if we
assign it to the struct usb_device_id::driver_info.

This patch assigns the usb_device_id::driver_info and converts
peak_usb_probe() to make use of it. This reduces the driver size by
100 bytes on ARCH=arm.
