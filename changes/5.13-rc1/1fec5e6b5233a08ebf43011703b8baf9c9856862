firmware: arm_scmi: Port perf protocol to new protocols interface

Convert internals of protocol implementation to use protocol handles and
expose a new protocol operations interface for SCMI driver using the new
get/put common operations, while keeping the old handle->perf_ops still
around to ease transition.

Remove handle->perf_priv now unused.
