scsi: lpfc: Remove unsupported mbox PORT_CAPABILITIES logic

SLI-4 does not contain a PORT_CAPABILITIES mailbox command (only SLI-3
does, and SLI-3 doesn't use it), yet there are SLI-4 code paths that have
code to issue the command.  The command will always fail.

Remove the code for the mailbox command and leave only the resulting
"failure path" logic.
