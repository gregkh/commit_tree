ACPI: CPPC: Add emtpy stubs of functions for CONFIG_ACPI_CPPC_LIB unset

For convenience, add empty stubs of library functions defined in
cppc_acpi.c for the CONFIG_ACPI_CPPC_LIB unset case.

Because one of them needs to return CPUFREQ_ETERNAL, include
linux/cpufreq.h into the CPPC library header file and drop the
direct inclusion of it from cppc_acpi.c.
