net: dsa: free skb->cb usage in core driver

Free skb->cb usage in core driver and let device drivers decide to
use or not. The reason having a DSA_SKB_CB(skb)->clone was because
dsa_skb_tx_timestamp() which may set the clone pointer was called
before p->xmit() which would use the clone if any, and the device
driver has no way to initialize the clone pointer.

This patch just put memset(skb->cb, 0, sizeof(skb->cb)) at beginning
of dsa_slave_xmit(). Some new features in the future, like one-step
timestamp may need more bytes of skb->cb to use in
dsa_skb_tx_timestamp(), and p->xmit().
