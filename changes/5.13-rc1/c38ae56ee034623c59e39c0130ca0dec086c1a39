pata_ipx4xx_cf: Fix unsigned comparison with less than zero

The return from the call to platform_get_irq() is int, it can be
a negative error code, however this is being assigned to an unsigned
int variable 'irq', so making 'irq' an int, and change the position to
keep the code format.

WARNING: Unsigned expression compared with zero: irq > 0
