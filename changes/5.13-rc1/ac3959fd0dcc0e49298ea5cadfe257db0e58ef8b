tcp: remove obsolete check in __tcp_retransmit_skb()

TSQ provides a nice way to avoid bufferbloat on individual socket,
including retransmit packets. We can get rid of the old
heuristic:

	/* Do not sent more than we queued. 1/4 is reserved for possible
	 * copying overhead: fragmentation, tunneling, mangling etc.
	 */
	if (refcount_read(&sk->sk_wmem_alloc) >
	    min_t(u32, sk->sk_wmem_queued + (sk->sk_wmem_queued >> 2),
		  sk->sk_sndbuf))
		return -EAGAIN;

This heuristic was giving false positives according to Jakub,
whenever TX completions are delayed above RTT. (Ack packets
are processed by TCP stack before clones are orphaned/freed)
