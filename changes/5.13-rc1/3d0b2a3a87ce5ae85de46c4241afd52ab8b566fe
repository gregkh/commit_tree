PCI: keystone: Let AM65 use the pci_ops defined in pcie-designware-host.c

Both TI's AM65x (K3) and TI's K2 PCIe driver are implemented in
pci-keystone. However Only K2 PCIe driver should use it's own pci_ops
for configuration space accesses. But commit 10a797c6e54a
("PCI: dwc: keystone: Use pci_ops for config space accessors") used
custom pci_ops for both AM65x and K2. This breaks configuration space
access for AM65x platform. Fix it here.
