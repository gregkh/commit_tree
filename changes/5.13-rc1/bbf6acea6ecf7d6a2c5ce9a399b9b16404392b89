net: macb: Remove redundant assignment to queue

Variable queue is set to bp->queues but these values is not used as it
is overwritten later on, hence redundant assignment  can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/net/ethernet/cadence/macb_main.c:4919:21: warning: Value stored
to 'queue' during its initialization is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].

to 'queue' during its initialization is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
