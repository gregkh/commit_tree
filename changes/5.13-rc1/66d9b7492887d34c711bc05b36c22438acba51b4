powerpc/perf: Fix the threshold event selection for memory events in power10

Memory events (mem-loads and mem-stores) currently use the threshold
event selection as issue to finish. Power10 supports issue to complete
as part of thresholding which is more appropriate for mem-loads and
mem-stores. Hence fix the event code for memory events to use issue
to complete.
