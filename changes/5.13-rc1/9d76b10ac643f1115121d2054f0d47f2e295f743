USB: serial: ark3116: fix TIOCGSERIAL implementation

TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
closing_wait parameters.

The port parameter is used to set the I/O port and does not make any
sense to use for USB serial devices.

The baud_base parameter could be used to set the UART base clock when it
could not be detected but might as well be left unset when it is not
known.

The close_delay and closing_wait parameters returned by TIOCGSERIAL are
specified in centiseconds. The driver does not yet support changing
these, but let's report back the default values actually used (0.5 and
30 seconds, respectively).
