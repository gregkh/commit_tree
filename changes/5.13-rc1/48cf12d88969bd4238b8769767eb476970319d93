powerpc/irq: Inline call_do_irq() and call_do_softirq()

call_do_irq() and call_do_softirq() are simple enough to be
worth inlining.

Inlining them avoids an mflr/mtlr pair plus a save/reload on stack.

This is inspired from S390 arch. Several other arches do more or
less the same. The way sparc arch does seems odd thought.
