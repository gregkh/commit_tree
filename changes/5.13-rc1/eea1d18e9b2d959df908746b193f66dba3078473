ASoC: SOF: use current DAI config during resume

Recently, the sof_pcm_dai_link_fixup() function was
updated to match SSP config with the PCM hw_params
and set the current_config for the DAI widget.

But the sof_restore_pipelines() function still chooses the
default config for the DAI widget upon resuming. Fix this
to use the last used config when setting up the DAI widget
during resume.
