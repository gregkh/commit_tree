Revert "Revert "sctp: Fix bundling of SHUTDOWN with COOKIE-ACK""

This reverts commit 7e9269a5acec6d841d22e12770a0b02db4f5d8f2.

As Jere notice, commit 35b4f24415c8 ("sctp: do asoc update earlier
in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a") only keeps the SHUTDOWN and COOKIE-ACK
with the same asoc, not transport. So we have to bring this patch
back.
