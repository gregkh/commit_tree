tipc: fix unique bearer names sanity check

When enabling a bearer by name, we don't sanity check its name with
higher slot in bearer list. This may have the effect that the name
of an already enabled bearer bypasses the check.

To fix the above issue, we just perform an extra checking with all
existing bearers.
