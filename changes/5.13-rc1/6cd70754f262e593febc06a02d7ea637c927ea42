libperf: Add evsel mmap support

In order to support usersapce access, an event must be mmapped. While
there's already mmap support for evlist, the usecase is a bit different
than the self monitoring with userspace access. So let's add new
perf_evsel__mmap()/perf_evsel_munmap() functions to mmap/munmap an
evsel. This allows implementing userspace access as a fastpath for
perf_evsel__read().

The mmapped address is returned by perf_evsel__mmap_base() which
primarily for users/tests to check if userspace access is enabled.
