scsi: ufs: ufs-debugfs: Add user-defined exception event rate limiting

An enabled user-specified exception event that does not clear quickly will
repeatedly cause the handler to run. That could unduly disturb the driver
behaviour being tested or debugged. To prevent that add debugfs file
exception_event_rate_limit_ms. When a exception event happens, it is
disabled, and then after a period of time (default 20ms) the exception
event is enabled again.

Note that if the driver also has that exception event enabled, it will not
be disabled.
