bus: mhi: pci_generic: No-Op for device_wake operations

The wake_db register presence is highly speculative and can fuze MHI
devices. Indeed, currently the wake_db register address is defined at
entry 127 of the 'Channel doorbell array', thus writing to this address
is equivalent to ringing the doorbell for channel 127, causing trouble
with some devics (e.g. SDX24 based modems) that get an unexpected
channel 127 doorbell interrupt.

This change fixes that issue by setting wake get/put as no-op for
pci_generic devices. The wake device sideband mechanism seems really
specific to each device, and is AFAIK not defined by the MHI spec.

It also removes zeroing initialization of wake_db register during MMIO
initialization, the register being set via wake_get/put accessors few
cycles later during M0 transition.
