ceph: don't use d_add in ceph_handle_snapdir

It's possible ceph_get_snapdir could end up finding a (disconnected)
inode that already exists in the cache. Change the prototype for
ceph_handle_snapdir to return a dentry pointer and have it use
d_splice_alias so we don't end up with an aliased dentry in the cache.
