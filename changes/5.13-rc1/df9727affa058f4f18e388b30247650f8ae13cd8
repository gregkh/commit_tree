io_uring: put link timeout req consistently

Don't put linked timeout req in io_async_find_and_cancel() but do it in
io_link_timeout_fn(), so we have only one point for that and won't have
to do it differently as it's now (put vs put_deferred). Btw, improve a
bit io_async_find_and_cancel()'s locking.
