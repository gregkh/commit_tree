KVM: x86/mmu: Remove spurious clearing of dirty bit from TDP MMU SPTE

Don't clear the dirty bit when aging a TDP MMU SPTE (in response to a MMU
notifier event).  Prematurely clearing the dirty bit could cause spurious
PML updates if aging a page happened to coincide with dirty logging.

Note, tdp_mmu_set_spte_no_acc_track() flows into __handle_changed_spte(),
so the host PFN will be marked dirty, i.e. there is no potential for data
corruption.
