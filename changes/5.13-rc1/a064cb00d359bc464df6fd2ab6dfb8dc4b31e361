kasan: initialize shadow to TAG_INVALID for SW_TAGS

Currently, KASAN_SW_TAGS uses 0xFF as the default tag value for
unallocated memory.  The underlying idea is that since that memory hasn't
been allocated yet, it's only supposed to be dereferenced through a
pointer with the native 0xFF tag.

While this is a good idea in terms on consistency, practically it doesn't
bring any benefit.  Since the 0xFF pointer tag is a match-all tag, it
doesn't matter what tag the accessed memory has.  No accesses through
0xFF-tagged pointers are considered buggy by KASAN.

This patch changes the default tag value for unallocated memory to 0xFE,
which is the tag KASAN uses for inaccessible memory.  This doesn't affect
accesses through 0xFF-tagged pointer to this memory, but this allows KASAN
to detect wild and large out-of-bounds invalid memory accesses through
otherwise-tagged pointers.

This is a prepatory patch for the next one, which changes the tag-based
KASAN modes to not poison the boot memory.
