pwm: Always allocate PWM chip base ID dynamically

Since commit 5e5da1e9fbee ("pwm: ab8500: Explicitly allocate pwm chip
base dynamically") all drivers use dynamic ID allocation explicitly. New
drivers are supposed to do the same, so remove support for driver
specified base IDs and drop all assignments in the low-level drivers.
