ASoC: rt5645: The ALC3270 variant does not have a headset-mic pin

The Asus T100HA and T101HA 2-in-1s use a rt5645 family codec and always
report that a headset (rather then headphones) are plugged in even when
regular headphones are plugged in.

And when a headset is used, then the headset-microphone does not work.
According to RealTek the ALC3270 variant used in these devices does not
support headsets only headphones.

Since the ALC3270 is a budget version of the regular ALC5645 codec,
I assume that it is using a package with less pins and the headset-mic
pin is simply not connected.

Detect if the codec is an ALC3270 based on the ACPI HID and if it is
an ALC3270 then always report SND_JACK_MICROPHONE as false, so that
userspace will not try to use the not-connected headset-mic.
