KVM: x86: Move RDPMC emulation to common code

Move the entirety of the accelerated RDPMC emulation to x86.c, and assign
the common handler directly to the exit handler array for VMX.  SVM has
bizarre nrips behavior that prevents it from directly invoking the common
handler.  The nrips goofiness will be addressed in a future patch.
