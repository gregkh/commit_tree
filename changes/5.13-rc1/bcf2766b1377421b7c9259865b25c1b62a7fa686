net: bridge: resolve forwarding path for VLAN tag actions in bridge devices

Depending on the VLAN settings of the bridge and the port, the bridge can
either add or remove a tag. When vlan filtering is enabled, the fdb lookup
also needs to know the VLAN tag/proto for the destination address
To provide this, keep track of the stack of VLAN tags for the path in the
lookup context
