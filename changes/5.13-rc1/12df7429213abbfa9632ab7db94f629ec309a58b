KVM: arm64: GICv4.1: Restore VLPI pending state to physical side

When setting the forwarding path of a VLPI (switch to the HW mode),
we can also transfer the pending state from irq->pending_latch to
VPT (especially in migration, the pending states of VLPIs are restored
into kvmâ€™s vgic first). And we currently send "INT+VSYNC" to trigger
a VLPI to pending.
