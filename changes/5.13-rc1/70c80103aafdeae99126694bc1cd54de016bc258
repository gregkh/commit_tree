locking/rtmutex: Consolidate the fast/slowpath invocation

The indirection via a function pointer (which is at least optimized into a
tail call by the compiler) is making the code hard to read.

Clean it up and move the futex related trylock functions down to the futex
section.

Move the wake_q wakeup into rt_mutex_slowunlock(). No point in handing it
to the caller. The futex code uses a different function.
