regmap-irq: Fix dereference of a potentially null d->virt_buf

The clean up of struct d can potentiallly index into a null array
d->virt_buf causing errorenous pointer dereferencing issues on
kfree calls.  Fix this by adding a null check on d->virt_buf before
attempting to traverse the array to kfree the objects.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference after null check")
Fixes: 4c5014456305 ("regmap-irq: Introduce virtual regs to handle more config regs")
