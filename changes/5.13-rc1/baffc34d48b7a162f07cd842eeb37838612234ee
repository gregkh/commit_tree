dt-bindings: aspeed-lpc: Remove LPC partitioning

The LPC controller has no concept of the BMC and the Host partitions.
This patch fixes the documentation by removing the description on LPC
partitions. The register offsets illustrated in the DTS node examples
are also fixed to adapt to the LPC DTS change.
