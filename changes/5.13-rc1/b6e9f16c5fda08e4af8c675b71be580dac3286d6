btrfs: replace open coded while loop with proper construct

btrfs_inc_block_group_ro wants to ensure that the current transaction is
not running dirty block groups, if it is it waits and loops again.
That logic is currently implemented using a goto label. Actually using
a proper do {} while() construct doesn't hurt readability nor does it
introduce excessive nesting and makes the relevant code stand out by
being encompassed in the loop construct. No functional changes.
