KVM: x86: Move nVMX's consistency check macro to common code

Move KVM's CC() macro to x86.h so that it can be reused by nSVM.
Debugging VM-Enter is as painful on SVM as it is on VMX.

Rename the more visible macro to KVM_NESTED_VMENTER_CONSISTENCY_CHECK
to avoid any collisions with the uber-concise "CC".
