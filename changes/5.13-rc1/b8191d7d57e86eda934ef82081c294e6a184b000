kasan: docs: update GENERIC implementation details section

Update the "Implementation details" section for generic KASAN:

 - Don't mention kmemcheck, it's not present in the kernel anymore.

 - Don't mention GCC as the only supported compiler.

 - Update kasan_mem_to_shadow() definition to match actual code.

 - Punctuation, readability, and other minor clean-ups.
