net: ethernet: ixp4xx: Support device tree probing

This adds device tree probing to the IXP4xx ethernet
driver.

Add a platform data bool to tell us whether to
register an MDIO bus for the device or not, as well
as the corresponding NPE.

We need to drop the memory region request as part of
this since the OF core will request the memory for the
device.
