torture: Fix kvm.sh --datestamp regex check

Some versions of grep are happy to interpret a nonsensically placed "-"
within a "[]" pattern as a dash, while others give an error message.
This commit therefore places the "-" at the end of the expression where
it was supposed to be in the first place.
