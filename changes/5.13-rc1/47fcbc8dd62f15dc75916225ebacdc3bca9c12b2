rcu: Fix CPU-offline trace in rcutree_dying_cpu

The condition in the trace_rcu_grace_period() in rcutree_dying_cpu() is
backwards, so that it uses the string "cpuofl" when the offline CPU is
blocking the current grace period and "cpuofl-bgp" otherwise.  Given that
the "-bgp" stands for "blocking grace period", this is at best misleading.
This commit therefore switches these strings in order to correctly trace
whether the outgoing cpu blocks the current grace period.
