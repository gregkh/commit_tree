selftests: xsk: Split worker thread

Let's a have a separate Tx/Rx worker threads instead of a one common
thread packed with Tx/Rx specific checks.

Move mmap for umem buffer space and a switch_namespace() call to
thread_common_ops.

This also allows for a bunch of simplifactions that are the subject of
the next commits. The final result will be a code base that is much
easier to follow.
