net: phy: marvell10g: support all rate matching modes

Add support for all rate matching modes for 88X3310 (currently only
10gbase-r is supported, but xaui and rxaui can also be used).

Add support for rate matching for 88E2110 (on 88E2110 the MACTYPE
register is at a different place).

Currently rate matching mode is selected by strapping pins (by setting
the MACTYPE register). There is work in progress to enable this driver
to deduce the best MACTYPE from the knowledge of which interface modes
are supported by the host, but this work is not finished yet.
