ASoC: simple-card-utils: Allocate link info structure on heap

struct link_info can grow fairly large and may cause the stack frame
size to be exceeded when allocated on the stack. Some architectures
such as 32-bit ARM, RISC-V or PowerPC have small stack frames where
this causes a compiler warning, so allocate these structures on the
heap instead of the stack.
