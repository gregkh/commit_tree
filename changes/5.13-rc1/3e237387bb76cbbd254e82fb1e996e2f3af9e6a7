arm64: Document requirements for fine grained traps at boot

The arm64 FEAT_FGT extension introduces a set of traps to EL2 for accesses
to small sets of registers and instructions from EL1 and EL0, access to
which is controlled by EL3.  Require access to it so that it is
available to us in future and so that we can ensure these traps are
disabled during boot.
