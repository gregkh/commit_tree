drm/i915/buddy: document the unused header bits

The largest possible order is (63-PAGE_SHIFT), given that our min chunk
size is PAGE_SIZE. With that we should only need at most 6 bits to
represent all possible orders, giving us back 4 bits for other potential
uses.  Include a simple selftest to verify this.
