static_call: Move struct static_call_key definition to static_call_types.h

Having the definition of static_call() in static_call_types.h makes
no sense as long struct static_call_key isn't defined there, as the
generic implementation of static_call() is referencing this structure.

So move the definition of struct static_call_key to static_call_types.h.
