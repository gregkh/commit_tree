i2c: imx: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

In i2c_imx_xfer() and i2c_imx_remove(), the pm reference count
is not expected to be incremented on return.

However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm reference count
even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a
reference leak here.

Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
counter balanced.
