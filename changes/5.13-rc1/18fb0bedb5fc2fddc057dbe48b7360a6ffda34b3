rtlwifi: 8821ae: upgrade PHY and RF parameters

The signal strength of 5G is quite low, so user can't connect to an AP far
away. New parameters with new format and its parser are updated by the commit
84d26fda52e2 ("rtlwifi: Update 8821ae new phy parameters and its parser."), but
some parameters are missing. Use this commit to update to the novel parameters
that use new format.
