MIPS: ralink: rt288x: select MIPS_AUTO_PFN_OFFSET

RT288X systems may have a non-zero ramstart causing problems with memory
reservations and boot hangs, as well as messages like:
  Wasting 1048576 bytes for tracking 32768 unused pages

Both are alleviated by selecting MIPS_AUTO_PFN_OFFSET for such
platforms.

Tested on a Belkin F5D8235 v1 RT2880 device.
