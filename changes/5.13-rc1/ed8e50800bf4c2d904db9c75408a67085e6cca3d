signal, perf: Add missing TRAP_PERF case in siginfo_layout()

Add the missing TRAP_PERF case in siginfo_layout() for interpreting the
layout correctly as SIL_PERF_EVENT instead of just SIL_FAULT. This
ensures the si_perf field is copied and not just the si_addr field.

This was caught and tested by running the perf_events/sigtrap_threads
kselftest as a 32-bit binary with a 64-bit kernel.
