drm/amd/display: add a func to disable accelerated mode

[Why]
When driver disabled, we driver force the YCbCr420 to RGB,
which means some register will be changed, such as
RDPCS_PHY_DP_MPLLB_TX_CLK_DIV changed from 1 to 0
When driver re-enabled, OS will Set Mode YCbCr420 again,
which means the register RDPCS_PHY_DP_MPLLB_TX_CLK_DIV
should to be 1 again, but dmub fw canâ€™t update the
register to 1 due to the mpll is not off

[How]
Adds an interface to disable accelerated mode bit,
which allows DM to decide to call during driver
disable/unload scenarios.
