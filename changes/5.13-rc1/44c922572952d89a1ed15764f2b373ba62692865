RISC-V: enable XIP

Introduce XIP (eXecute In Place) support for RISC-V platforms.
It allows code to be executed directly from non-volatile storage
directly addressable by the CPU, such as QSPI NOR flash which can
be found on many RISC-V platforms. This makes way for significant
optimization of RAM footprint. The XIP kernel is not compressed
since it has to run directly from flash, so it will occupy more
space on the non-volatile storage. The physical flash address used
to link the kernel object files and for storing it has to be known
at compile time and is represented by a Kconfig option.

XIP on RISC-V will for the time being only work on MMU-enabled
kernels.
