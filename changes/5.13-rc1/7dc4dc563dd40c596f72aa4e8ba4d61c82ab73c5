platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Remove global struct pmc_dev

The intel_pmc_core driver did not always bind to a device which meant it
lacked a struct device that could be used to maintain driver data. So a
global instance of struct pmc_dev was used for this purpose and functions
accessed this directly. Since the driver now binds to an ACPI device,
remove the global pmc_dev in favor of one that is allocated during probe.
Modify users of the global to obtain the object by argument instead.
