mtd: rawnand: brcmnand: fix OOB R/W with Hamming ECC

Hamming ECC doesn't cover the OOB data, so reading or writing OOB shall
always be done without ECC enabled.
This is a problem when adding JFFS2 cleanmarkers to erased blocks. If JFFS2
clenmarkers are added to the OOB with ECC enabled, OOB bytes will be changed
from ff ff ff to 00 00 00, reporting incorrect ECC errors.
