iio: chemical: atlas: Remove code to set trigger parent

iio_trigger_set_drvdata() sets the trigger device parent to first
argument of viio_trigger_alloc(), no need to do it again in the driver
code.

Given we call devm_iio_trigger_alloc() and devm_iio_device_alloc() with
&client->dev as parent, we do not have to set data->trig->dev.parent to
indio_dev->dev.parent anymore.
