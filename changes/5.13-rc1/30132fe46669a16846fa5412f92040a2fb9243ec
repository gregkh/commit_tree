iio: accel: kxcjk-1013: Set label based on accel-location on 2-accel yoga-style 2-in-1s

Some 2-in-1 laptops / convertibles with 360Â° (yoga-style) hinges,
use 2 KXCJ91008 accelerometers:
1 in their display using an ACPI HID of "KIOX010A"; and
1 in their base    using an ACPI HID of "KIOX020A"

Since in this case we know the location of each accelerometer,
set the label for the accelerometers to the standardized
"accel-display" resp. "accel-base" labels. This way userspace
can use the labels to get the location.

This was tested on a Medion Akoya E2228T MD60250.
