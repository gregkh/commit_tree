sched/fair: Remove update of blocked load from newidle_balance

newidle_balance runs with both preempt and irq disabled which prevent
local irq to run during this period. The duration for updating the
blocked load of CPUs varies according to the number of CPU cgroups
with non-decayed load and extends this critical period to an uncontrolled
level.

Remove the update from newidle_balance and trigger a normal ILB that
will take care of the update instead.

This reduces the IRQ latency from O(nr_cgroups * nr_nohz_cpus) to
O(nr_cgroups).
