powerpc/perf: Fix PMU constraint check for EBB events

The power PMU group constraints includes check for EBB events to make
sure all events in a group must agree on EBB. This will prevent
scheduling EBB and non-EBB events together. But in the existing check,
settings for constraint mask and value is interchanged. Patch fixes the
same.

Before the patch, PMU selftest "cpu_event_pinned_vs_ebb_test" fails with
below in dmesg logs. This happens because EBB event gets enabled along
with a non-EBB cpu event.

  [35600.453346] cpu_event_pinne[41326]: illegal instruction (4)
  at 10004a18 nip 10004a18 lr 100049f8 code 1 in
  cpu_event_pinned_vs_ebb_test[10000000+10000]

Test results after the patch:

  $ ./pmu/ebb/cpu_event_pinned_vs_ebb_test
  test: cpu_event_pinned_vs_ebb

This bug was hidden by other logic until commit 1908dc911792 (perf:
Tweak perf_event_attr::exclusive semantics).
