include/linux/compiler-gcc.h: sparse can do constant folding of __builtin_bswap*()

Sparse can do constant folding of __builtin_bswap*() since 2017.  Also, a
much recent version of Sparse is needed anyway, see commit 6ec4476ac825
("Raise gcc version requirement to 4.9").

So, remove the comment about sparse not being yet able to constant fold
__builtin_bswap*() and remove the corresponding test of __CHECKER__.
