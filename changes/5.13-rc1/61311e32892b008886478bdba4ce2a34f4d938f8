s390/pci: narrow scope of zpci_configure_device()

Currently zpci_configure_device() can be called on a zPCI function in
two completely different states. Either the underlying zPCI function has
already been configured by the platform and we are only doing the
scanning to get it usable by Linux drivers. Or the underlying function
is in Standby and we first do an SCLP to get it configured. This makes
zpci_configure_device() harder to reason about. Since calling
zpci_configure_device() on a function in Standby only happens in
enable_slot() simply pull out the SCLP call and setting of zdev->state
and thus call zpci_configure_device() under the same circumstances as
in the event handling code.
