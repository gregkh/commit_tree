kbuild: include Makefile.compiler only when compiler is needed

Since commit f2f02ebd8f38 ("kbuild: improve cc-option to clean up all
temporary files"), running 'make kernelversion' in a read-only source
tree emits a bunch of warnings:

  mkdir: cannot create directory '.tmp_12345': Permission denied

No-build targets such as kernelversion, clean, help, etc. do not
need to evaluate $(call cc-option,) or friends. Skip Makefile.compiler
so $(call cc-option,) becomes no-op.

This not only fixes the warnings, but also runs non-build targets much
faster.

Basically, all installation targets should also be non-build targets.
Unfortunately, vdso_install requires the compiler because it builds
vdso before installation. This is a problem that must be fixed by a
separate patch.
