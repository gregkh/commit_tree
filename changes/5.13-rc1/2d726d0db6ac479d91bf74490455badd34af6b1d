arm64: Get rid of CONFIG_ARM64_VHE

CONFIG_ARM64_VHE was introduced with ARMv8.1 (some 7 years ago),
and has been enabled by default for almost all that time.

Given that newer systems that are VHE capable are finally becoming
available, and that some systems are even incapable of not running VHE,
drop the configuration altogether.

Anyone willing to stick to non-VHE on VHE hardware for obscure
reasons should use the 'kvm-arm.mode=nvhe' command-line option.
