net: ipa: update IPA register comments

Add and update IPA register definitions.  Extend these definitions
to incorporate a fairly small number of new symbols (register
offsets and fields) to support IPA v3.0, v3.1, v3.5, v4.0, v4.1,
v4.7, 4.9, and v4.11, and have the comments reflect when they are
valid.  None of the added symbols require changes elsewhere in the
code.

Update rsrc_grp_encoded() to support these other IPA versions.

Add kerneldoc comments for the IPA IRQ numbers and sequencer type.

Fix a few spots where the version check should be less restrictive
(missed by an earlier patch).
