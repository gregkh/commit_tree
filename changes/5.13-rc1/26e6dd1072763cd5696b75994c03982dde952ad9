selftests: Set CC to clang in lib.mk if LLVM is set

selftests/bpf/Makefile includes lib.mk. With the following command
  make -j60 LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1  <=== compile kernel
  make -j60 -C tools/testing/selftests/bpf LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 V=1
some files are still compiled with gcc. This patch
fixed lib.mk issue which sets CC to gcc in all cases.
