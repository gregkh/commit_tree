bpf: Notify user if we ever hit a bpf_snprintf verifier bug

In check_bpf_snprintf_call(), a map_direct_value_addr() of the fmt map
should never fail because it has already been checked by
ARG_PTR_TO_CONST_STR. But if it ever fails, it's better to error out
with an explicit debug message rather than silently fail.
