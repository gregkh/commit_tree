blk-mq: Fix spurious debugfs directory creation during initialization

blk_mq_debugfs_register_sched_hctx() called from
device_add_disk()->elevator_init_mq()->blk_mq_init_sched()
initialization sequence does not have relevant parent directory
setup and thus spuriously attempts "sched" directory creation
from root mount of debugfs for every hw queue detected on the
block device

dmesg
...
debugfs: Directory 'sched' with parent '/' already present!
debugfs: Directory 'sched' with parent '/' already present!
.

The parent debugfs directory for hw queues get properly setup
device_add_disk()->blk_register_queue()->blk_mq_debugfs_register()
->blk_mq_debugfs_register_hctx() later in the block device
initialization sequence.

A simple check for debugfs_dir has been added to thwart premature
debugfs directory/file creation attempts.
