KVM: x86/mmu: Set the C-bit in the PDPTRs and LM pseudo-PDPTRs

Set the C-bit in SPTEs that are set outside of the normal MMU flows,
specifically the PDPDTRs and the handful of special cased "LM root"
entries, all of which are shadow paging only.

Note, the direct-mapped-root PDPTR handling is needed for the scenario
where paging is disabled in the guest, in which case KVM uses a direct
mapped MMU even though TDP is disabled.
