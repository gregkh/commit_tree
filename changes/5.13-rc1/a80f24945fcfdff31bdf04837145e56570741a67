i2c: mediatek: Use scl_int_delay_ns to compensate clock-stretching

The parameters of tSU,STA/tHD,STA/tSU,STOP maybe out of spec due
to device clock-stretch or circuit loss, we could get a suitable
scl_int_delay_ns from i2c_timings to compensate these parameters
to meet the spec via EXT_CONF register.
