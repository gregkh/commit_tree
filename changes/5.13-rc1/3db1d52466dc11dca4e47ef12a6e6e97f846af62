serial: stm32: fix tx_empty condition

In "tx_empty", we should poll TC bit in both DMA and PIO modes (instead of
TXE) to check transmission data register has been transmitted independently
of the FIFO mode. TC indicates that both transmit register and shift
register are empty. When shift register is empty, tx_empty should return
TIOCSER_TEMT instead of TC value.

Cleans the USART_CR_TC TCCF register define (transmission complete clear
flag) as it is duplicate of USART_ICR_TCCF.
