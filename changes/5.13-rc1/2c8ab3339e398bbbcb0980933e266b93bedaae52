drm/i915: Pin timeline map after first timeline pin, v4.

We're starting to require the reservation lock for pinning,
so wait until we have that.

Update the selftests to handle this correctly, and ensure pin is
called in live_hwsp_rollover_user() and mock_hwsp_freelist().

Changes since v1:
- Fix NULL + XX arithmatic, use casts. (kbuild)
Changes since v2:
- Clear entire cacheline when pinning.
Changes since v3:
- CACHELINE_BYTES -> TIMELINE_SEQNO_BYTES. (jekstrand)
