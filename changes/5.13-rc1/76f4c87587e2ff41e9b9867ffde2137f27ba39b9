remoteproc: Properly represent the attached state

There is a need to know when a remote processor has been attached
to rather than booted by the remoteproc core.  In order to avoid
manipulating two variables, i.e rproc::autonomous and
rproc::state, get rid of the former and simply use the newly
introduced RPROC_ATTACHED state.
