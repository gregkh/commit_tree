bnxt_en: Enhance retry of the first message to the firmware.

Two enhancements:

1. Read the health status first before sending the first
HWRM_VER_GET message to firmware instead of the other way around.
This guarantees we got the accurate health status before we attempt
to send the message.

2. We currently only retry sending the first HWRM_VER_GET message to
the firmware if the firmware is in the process of booting.  If the
firmware is in error state and is doing core dump for example, the
driver should also retry if the health register has the RECOVERING
flag set.  This flag indicates the firmware will undergo recovery
soon.  Modify the retry logic to retry for this case as well.
