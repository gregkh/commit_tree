virtio_console: remove pointless check for debugfs_create_dir()

It is impossible for debugfs_create_dir() to return NULL, so checking
for it gives people a false sense that they actually are doing something
if an error occurs.  As there is no need to ever change kernel logic if
debugfs is working "properly" or not, there is no need to check the
return value of debugfs calls, so remove the checks here as they will
never be triggered and are wrong.
