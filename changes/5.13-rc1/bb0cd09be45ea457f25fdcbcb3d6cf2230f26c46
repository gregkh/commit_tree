drm/amdgpu: Fix some unload driver issues

When unloading driver after killing some applications, it will hit sdma
flush tlb job timeout which is called by ttm_bo_delay_delete. So
to avoid the job submit after fence driver fini, call ttm_bo_lock_delayed_workqueue
before fence driver fini. And also put drm_sched_fini before waiting fence.
