KVM: x86: Move trivial instruction-based exit handlers to common code

Move the trivial exit handlers, e.g. for instructions that KVM
"emulates" as nops, to common x86 code.  Assign the common handlers
directly to the exit handler arrays and drop the vendor trampolines.

Opportunistically use pr_warn_once() where appropriate.

No functional change intended.
