cifs: simplify SWN code with dummy funcs instead of ifdefs

This commit doesn't change the logic of SWN.

Add dummy implementation of SWN functions when SWN is disabled instead
of using ifdef sections.

The dummy functions get optimized out, this leads to clearer code and
compile time type-checking regardless of config options with no
runtime penalty.

Leave the simple ifdefs section as-is.

A single bitfield (bool foo:1) on its own will use up one int. Move
tcon->use_witness out of ifdefs with the other tcon bitfields.
