firmware: arm_scmi: Convert events registration to protocol handles

Convert all refactored events registration routines to use protocol
handles.

In order to maintain bisectability and to allow protocols and drivers
to be later ported to the new protocol handle interface one by one,
introduce here also some transient code that will be removed later
in order to ease such transition.
