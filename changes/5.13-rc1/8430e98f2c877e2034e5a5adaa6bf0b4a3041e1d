usb: cdns3: Optimize DMA request buffer allocation

dma_alloc_coherent() might fail on the platform with a small
DMA region.

To avoid such failure in cdns3_prepare_aligned_request_buf(),
dma_alloc_coherent() is replaced with dma_alloc_noncoherent()
to allocate aligned request buffer of dynamic length.
