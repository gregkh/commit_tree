x86/sgx: Initialize virtual EPC driver even when SGX driver is disabled

Modify sgx_init() to always try to initialize the virtual EPC driver,
even if the SGX driver is disabled.  The SGX driver might be disabled
if SGX Launch Control is in locked mode, or not supported in the
hardware at all.  This allows (non-Linux) guests that support non-LC
configurations to use SGX.
