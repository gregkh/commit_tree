mm/page_alloc: rename alloc_mask to alloc_gfp

Patch series "Rationalise __alloc_pages wrappers", v3.

I was poking around the __alloc_pages variants trying to understand why
they each exist, and couldn't really find a good justification for keeping
__alloc_pages and __alloc_pages_nodemask as separate functions.  That led
to getting rid of alloc_pages_current() and then I noticed the
documentation was bad, and then I noticed the mempolicy documentation
wasn't included.

Anyway, this is all cleanups & doc fixes.

This patch (of 7):

We have two masks involved -- the nodemask and the gfp mask, so alloc_mask
is an unclear name.
