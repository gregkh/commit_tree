KVM: nSVM: do not mark all VMCB02 fields dirty on nested vmexit

Since L1 and L2 now use different VMCBs, most of the fields remain the
same in VMCB02 from one L2 run to the next.  Since KVM itself is not
looking at VMCB12's clean field, for now not much can be optimized.
However, in the future we could avoid more copies if the VMCB12's SEG
and DT sections are clean.
