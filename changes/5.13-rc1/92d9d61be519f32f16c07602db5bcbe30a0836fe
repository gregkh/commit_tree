powerpc/mce: save ignore_event flag unconditionally for UE

When we hit an UE while using machine check safe copy routines,
ignore_event flag is set and the event is ignored by mce handler,
And the flag is also saved for defered handling and printing of
mce event information, But as of now saving of this flag is done
on checking if the effective address is provided or physical address
is calculated, which is not right.

Save ignore_event flag regardless of whether the effective address is
provided or physical address is calculated.

Without this change following log is seen, when the event is to be
ignored.
