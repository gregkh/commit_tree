powerpc/64s: Use htab_convert_pte_flags() in hash__mark_rodata_ro()

In hash__mark_rodata_ro() we pass the raw PP_RXXX value to
hash__change_memory_range(). That has the effect of setting the key to
zero, because PP_RXXX contains no key value.

Fix it by using htab_convert_pte_flags(), which knows how to convert a
pgprot into a pp value, including the key.
