coresight: etm: perf: Make symbol 'format_attr_contextid' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-etm-perf.c:61:25: warning:
 symbol 'format_attr_contextid' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of coresight-etm-perf.c, so this
commit marks it static.
