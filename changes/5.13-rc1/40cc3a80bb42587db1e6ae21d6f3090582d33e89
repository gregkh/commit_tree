kgdb: fix gcc-11 warning on indentation

gcc-11 starts warning about misleading indentation inside of macros:

drivers/misc/kgdbts.c: In function ‘kgdbts_break_test’:
drivers/misc/kgdbts.c:103:9: error: this ‘if’ clause does not guard... [-Werror=misleading-indentation]
  103 |         if (verbose > 1) \
      |         ^~
drivers/misc/kgdbts.c:200:9: note: in expansion of macro ‘v2printk’
  200 |         v2printk("kgdbts: breakpoint complete\n");
      |         ^~~~~~~~
drivers/misc/kgdbts.c:105:17: note: ...this statement, but the latter is misleadingly indented as if it were guarded by the ‘if’
  105 |                 touch_nmi_watchdog();   \
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code looks correct to me, so just reindent it for readability.
