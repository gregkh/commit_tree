scsi: sbitmap: Move allocation hint into sbitmap

Allocation hint should have belonged to sbitmap. Also, when sbitmap's depth
is high and there is no need to use mulitple wakeup queues, user can
benefit from percpu allocation hint too.

Move allocation hint into sbitmap, then SCSI device queue can benefit from
allocation hint when converting to plain sbitmap.

Convert vhost/scsi.c to use sbitmap allocation with percpu alloc hint. This
is more efficient than the previous approach.
