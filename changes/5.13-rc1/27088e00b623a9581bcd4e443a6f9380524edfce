usb: dwc3: fix incorrect kernel-doc comment syntax in files

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
There are certain files in drivers/usb/dwc3, which follow this syntax,
but the content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.
Such lines were probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but are parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warnings from kernel-doc.

E.g., presence of kernel-doc like comment in drivers/usb/dwc3/io.h at
header causes this warnings by kernel-doc:
"warning: expecting prototype for h(). Prototype was for __DRIVERS_USB_DWC3_IO_H() instead"

Similarly for other files too.

Provide a simple fix by replacing such occurrences with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
