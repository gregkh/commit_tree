mm: no more EINVAL from /proc/sys/vm/stat_refresh

EINVAL was good for drawing the refresher's attention to a warning in
dmesg, but became very tiresome when running test suites scripted with
"set -e": an underflow from a bug in one feature would cause unrelated
tests much later to fail, just because their /proc/sys/vm/stat_refresh
touch failed with that error.  Stop doing that.
