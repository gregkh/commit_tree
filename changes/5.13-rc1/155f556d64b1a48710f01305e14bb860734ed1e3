libbpf: Add bpf object kern_version attribute setter

Unfortunately some distros don't have their kernel version defined
accurately in <linux/version.h> due to different long term support
reasons.

It is important to have a way to override the bpf kern_version
attribute during runtime: some old kernels might still check for
kern_version attribute during bpf_prog_load().
