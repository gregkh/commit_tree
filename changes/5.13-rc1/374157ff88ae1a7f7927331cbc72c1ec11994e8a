usb: typec: tcpm: Fix error while calculating PPS out values

"usb: typec: tcpm: Address incorrect values of tcpm psy for pps supply"
introduced a regression for req_out_volt and req_op_curr calculation.

req_out_volt should consider the newly calculated max voltage instead
of previously accepted max voltage by the port partner. Likewise,
req_op_curr should consider the newly calculated max current instead
of previously accepted max current by the port partner.
