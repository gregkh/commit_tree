drm/amdgpu: Add bad_page_cnt_threshold to debugfs

Add bad_page_cnt_threshold to debugfs, an optional
file system used for debugging, for reporting
purposes only--it usually matches the size of
EEPROM but may be different depending on the
"bad_page_threshold" kernel module option.

The "bad_page_cnt_threshold" is a dynamically
computed value. It depends on three things: the
VRAM size; the size of the EEPROM (or the size
allocated to the RAS table therein); and the
"bad_page_threshold" module parameter. It is a
dynamically computed value, when the amdgpu module
is run, on which further parameters and logic
depend, and as such it is helpful to see the
dynamically computed value in debugfs.
