platform/x86: pmc_atom: Match all Beckhoff Automation baytrail boards with critclk_systems DMI table

pmc_plt_clk* clocks are used for ethernet controllers, so need to stay
turned on. This adds the affected board family to critclk_systems DMI
table, so the clocks are marked as CLK_CRITICAL and not turned off.

This replaces the previously listed boards with a match for the whole
device family CBxx63. CBxx63 matches only baytrail devices.
There are new affected boards that would otherwise need to be listed.
There are unaffected boards in the family, but having the clocks
turned on is not an issue.
