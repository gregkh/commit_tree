x86/sgx: Remove unnecessary kmap() from sgx_ioc_enclave_init()

kmap() is inefficient and is being replaced by kmap_local_page(), if
possible. There is no readily apparent reason why initp_page needs to be
allocated and kmap'ed() except that 'sigstruct' needs to be page-aligned
and 'token' 512 byte-aligned.

Rather than change it to kmap_local_page(), use kmalloc() instead
because kmalloc() can give this alignment when allocating PAGE_SIZE
bytes.

Remove the alloc_page()/kmap() and replace with kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE, ...)
to get a page aligned kernel address.

In addition, add a comment to document the alignment requirements so that
others don't attempt to 'fix' this again.
