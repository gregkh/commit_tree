powerpc/signal64: Replace setup_sigcontext() w/ unsafe_setup_sigcontext()

Previously setup_sigcontext() performed a costly KUAP switch on every
uaccess operation. These repeated uaccess switches cause a significant
drop in signal handling performance.

Rewrite setup_sigcontext() to assume that a userspace write access window
is open by replacing all uaccess functions with their 'unsafe' versions.
Modify the callers to first open, call unsafe_setup_sigcontext() and
then close the uaccess window.
