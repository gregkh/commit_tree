arm64: Kconfig: select KASAN_VMALLOC if KANSAN_GENERIC is enabled

Before this patch, someone who wants to use VMAP_STACK when
KASAN_GENERIC enabled must explicitly select KASAN_VMALLOC.

Because VMAP_STACK now depends on either HW_TAGS or KASAN_VMALLOC if
KASAN enabled, in order to make VMAP_STACK selected unconditionally,
we bind KANSAN_GENERIC and KASAN_VMALLOC together.

Note that SW_TAGS supports neither VMAP_STACK nor KASAN_VMALLOC now,
so this is the first step to make VMAP_STACK selected unconditionally.

Bind KANSAN_GENERIC and KASAN_VMALLOC together is supposed to cost more
memory at runtime, thus the alternative is using SW_TAGS KASAN instead.
