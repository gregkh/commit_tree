nexthop: __nh_notifier_single_info_init(): Make nh_info an argument

The cited function currently uses rtnl_dereference() to get nh_info from a
handed-in nexthop. However, under the resilient hashing scheme, this
function will not always be called under RTNL, sometimes the mutual
exclusion will be achieved differently. Therefore move the nh_info
extraction from the function to its callers to make it possible to use a
different synchronization guarantee.
