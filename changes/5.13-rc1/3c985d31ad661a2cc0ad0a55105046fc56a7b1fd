powerpc: Use common of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt()

The code for setting up the /chosen node in the device tree
and updating the memory reservation for the next kernel has been
moved to of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt() defined in "drivers/of/kexec.c".

Use the common of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt() to setup the device tree
and update the memory reservation for kexec for powerpc.
