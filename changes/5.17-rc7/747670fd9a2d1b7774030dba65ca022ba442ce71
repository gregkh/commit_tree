netfilter: nf_queue: don't assume sk is full socket

There is no guarantee that state->sk refers to a full socket.

If refcount transitions to 0, sock_put calls sk_free which then ends up
with garbage fields.

I'd like to thank Oleksandr Natalenko and Jiri Benc for considerable
debug work and pointing out state->sk oddities.
