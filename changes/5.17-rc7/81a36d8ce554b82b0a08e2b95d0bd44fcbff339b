Input: elan_i2c - move regulator_[en|dis]able() out of elan_[en|dis]able_power()

elan_disable_power() is called conditionally on suspend, where as
elan_enable_power() is always called on resume. This leads to
an imbalance in the regulator's enable count.

Move the regulator_[en|dis]able() calls out of elan_[en|dis]able_power()
in preparation of fixing this.

No functional changes intended.
