mptcp: accurate SIOCOUTQ for fallback socket

The MPTCP SIOCOUTQ implementation is not very accurate in
case of fallback: it only measures the data in the MPTCP-level
write queue, but it does not take in account the subflow
write queue utilization. In case of fallback the first can be
empty, while the latter is not.

The above produces sporadic self-tests issues and can foul
legit user-space application.

Fix the issue additionally querying the subflow in case of fallback.
