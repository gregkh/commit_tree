ibmvnic: clear fop when retrying probe

Clear ->failover_pending flag that may have been set in the previous
pass of registering CRQ. If we don't clear, a subsequent ibmvnic_open()
call would be misled into thinking a failover is pending and assuming
that the reset worker thread would open the adapter. If this pass of
registering the CRQ succeeds (i.e there is no transport event), there
wouldn't be a reset worker thread.

This would leave the adapter unconfigured and require manual intervention
to bring it up during boot.
