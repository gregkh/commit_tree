pinctrl: sunxi: Use unique lockdep classes for IRQs

This driver, like several others, uses a chained IRQ for each GPIO bank,
and forwards .irq_set_wake to the GPIO bank's upstream IRQ. As a result,
a call to irq_set_irq_wake() needs to lock both the upstream and
downstream irq_desc's. Lockdep considers this to be a possible deadlock
when the irq_desc's share lockdep classes, which they do by default:

 ============================================
 WARNING: possible recursive locking detected

 init/307 is trying to acquire lock:

 but task is already holding lock:

 other info that might help us debug this:
  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

   lock(&irq_desc_lock_class);
   lock(&irq_desc_lock_class);

  May be due to missing lock nesting notation

However, this can never deadlock because the upstream and downstream
IRQs are never the same (nor do they even involve the same irqchip).

Silence this erroneous lockdep splat by applying what appears to be the
usual fix of moving the GPIO IRQs to separate lockdep classes.
