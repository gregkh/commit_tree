ARM: 9178/1: fix unmet dependency on BITREVERSE for HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE

Resending this to properly add it to the patch tracker - thanks for letting
me know, Arnd :)

When ARM is enabled, and BITREVERSE is disabled,
Kbuild gives the following warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE
  Depends on [n]: BITREVERSE [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - ARM [=y] && (CPU_32v7M [=n] || CPU_32v7 [=y]) && !CPU_32v6 [=n]

This is because ARM selects HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE
without selecting BITREVERSE, despite
HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE depending on BITREVERSE.

This unmet dependency bug was found by Kismet,
a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise if this
is not the appropriate solution.
