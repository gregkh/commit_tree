iavf: Fix race in init state

When iavf_init_version_check sends VIRTCHNL_OP_GET_VF_RESOURCES
message, the driver will wait for the response after requeueing
the watchdog task in iavf_init_get_resources call stack. The
logic is implemented this way that iavf_init_get_resources has
to be called in order to allocate adapter->vf_res. It is polling
for the AQ response in iavf_get_vf_config function. Expect a
call trace from kernel when adminq_task worker handles this
message first. adapter->vf_res will be NULL in
iavf_virtchnl_completion.

Make the watchdog task not queue the adminq_task if the init
process is not finished yet.
