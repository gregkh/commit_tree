soc: fsl: qe: Check of ioremap return value

As the possible failure of the ioremap(), the par_io could be NULL.
Therefore it should be better to check it and return error in order to
guarantee the success of the initiation.
But, I also notice that all the caller like mpc85xx_qe_par_io_init() in
`arch/powerpc/platforms/85xx/common.c` don't check the return value of
the par_io_init().
Actually, par_io_init() needs to check to handle the potential error.
I will submit another patch to fix that.
Anyway, par_io_init() itsely should be fixed.
