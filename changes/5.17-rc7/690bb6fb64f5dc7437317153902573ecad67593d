batman-adv: Request iflink once in batadv-on-batadv check

There is no need to call dev_get_iflink multiple times for the same
net_device in batadv_is_on_batman_iface. And since some of the
.ndo_get_iflink callbacks are dynamic (for example via RCUs like in
vxcan_get_iflink), it could easily happen that the returned values are not
stable. The pre-checks before __dev_get_by_index are then of course bogus.
