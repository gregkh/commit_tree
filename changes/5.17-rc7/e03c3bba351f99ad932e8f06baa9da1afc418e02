xfrm: Fix xfrm migrate issues when address family changes

xfrm_migrate cannot handle address family change of an xfrm_state.
The symptons are the xfrm_state will be migrated to a wrong address,
and sending as well as receiving packets wil be broken.

This commit fixes it by breaking the original xfrm_state_clone
method into two steps so as to update the props.family before
running xfrm_init_state. As the result, xfrm_state's inner mode,
outer mode, type and IP header length in xfrm_state_migrate can
be updated with the new address family.
