iavf: Add waiting so the port is initialized in remove

There exist races when port is being configured and remove is
triggered.

unregister_netdev is not and can't be called under crit_lock
mutex since it is calling ndo_stop -> iavf_close which requires
this lock. Depending on init state the netdev could be still
unregistered so unregister_netdev never cleans up, when shortly
after that the device could become registered.

Make iavf_remove wait until port finishes initialization.
All critical state changes are atomic (under crit_lock).
Crashes that come from iavf_reset_interrupt_capability and
iavf_free_traffic_irqs should now be solved in a graceful
manner.
