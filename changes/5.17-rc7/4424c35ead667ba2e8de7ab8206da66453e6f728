auxdisplay: lcd2s: Fix lcd2s_redefine_char() feature

It seems that the lcd2s_redefine_char() has never been properly
tested. The buffer is filled by DEF_CUSTOM_CHAR command followed
by the character number (from 0 to 7), but immediately after that
these bytes are rewritten by the decoded hex stream.

Fix the index to fill the buffer after the command and number.
