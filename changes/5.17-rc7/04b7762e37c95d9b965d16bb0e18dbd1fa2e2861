Input: elan_i2c - fix regulator enable count imbalance after suspend/resume

Before these changes elan_suspend() would only disable the regulator
when device_may_wakeup() returns false; whereas elan_resume() would
unconditionally enable it, leading to an enable count imbalance when
device_may_wakeup() returns true.

This triggers the "WARN_ON(regulator->enable_count)" in regulator_put()
when the elan_i2c driver gets unbound, this happens e.g. with the
hot-plugable dock with Elan I2C touchpad for the Asus TF103C 2-in-1.

Fix this by making the regulator_enable() call also be conditional
on device_may_wakeup() returning false.
