selftests: mptcp: do complete cleanup at exit

After commit 05be5e273c84 ("selftests: mptcp: add disconnect tests")
the mptcp selftests leave behind a couple of tmp files after
each run. run_tests_disconnect() misnames a few variables used to
track them. Address the issue setting the appropriate global variables
