net/smc: fix unexpected SMC_CLC_DECL_ERR_REGRMB error generated by client

The main reason for this unexpected SMC_CLC_DECL_ERR_REGRMB in client
dues to following execution sequence:

Server Conn A:           Server Conn B:			Client Conn B:

smc_lgr_unregister_conn
                        smc_lgr_register_conn
                        smc_clc_send_accept     ->
                                                        smc_rtoken_add
smcr_buf_unuse
		->		Client Conn A:
				smc_rtoken_delete

smc_lgr_unregister_conn() makes current link available to assigned to new
incoming connection, while smcr_buf_unuse() has not executed yet, which
means that smc_rtoken_add may fail because of insufficient rtoken_entry,
reversing their execution order will avoid this problem.
