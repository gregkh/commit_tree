HID: add mapping for KEY_DICTATE

Numerous keyboards are adding dictate keys which allows for text
messages to be dictated by a microphone.

This patch adds a new key definition KEY_DICTATE and maps 0x0c/0x0d8
usage code to this new keycode. Additionally hid-debug is adjusted to
recognize this new usage code as well.
