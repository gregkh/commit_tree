efivars: Respect "block" flag in efivar_entry_set_safe()

When the "block" flag is false, the old code would sometimes still call
check_var_size(), which wrongly tells ->query_variable_store() that it can
block.

As far as I can tell, this can't really materialize as a bug at the moment,
because ->query_variable_store only does something on X86 with generic EFI,
and in that configuration we always take the efivar_entry_set_nonblocking()
path.

Fixes: ca0e30dcaa53 ("efi: Add nonblocking option to efi_query_variable_store()")
