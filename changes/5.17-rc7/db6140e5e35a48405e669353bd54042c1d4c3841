net/sched: act_ct: Fix flow table lookup failure with no originating ifindex

After cited commit optimizted hw insertion, flow table entries are
populated with ifindex information which was intended to only be used
for HW offload. This tuple ifindex is hashed in the flow table key, so
it must be filled for lookup to be successful. But tuple ifindex is only
relevant for the netfilter flowtables (nft), so it's not filled in
act_ct flow table lookup, resulting in lookup failure, and no SW
offload and no offload teardown for TCP connection FIN/RST packets.

To fix this, add new tc ifindex field to tuple, which will
only be used for offloading, not for lookup, as it will not be
part of the tuple hash.
