media: i2c: imx219: Balance runtime PM use-count

Move incrementing/decrementing runtime PM count to
imx219_start_streaming()/imx219_stop_streaming() functions respectively.

This fixes an issue of unbalanced runtime PM count in resume callback
error path where streaming is stopped and runtime PM count is left
unbalanced.
