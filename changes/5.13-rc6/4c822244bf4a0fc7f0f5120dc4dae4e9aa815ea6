iio: buffer: return 0 for buffer getfd ioctl handler

As Lars pointed out, we could either return the FD vs memcpy-ing it to the
userspace data object.

However, this comment exposed a bug. We should return 0 or negative from
these ioctl() handlers. Because an ioctl() handler can also return
IIO_IOCTL_UNHANDLED (which is positive 1), which means that the ioctl()
handler doesn't support this ioctl number. Positive 1 could also be a valid
FD number in some corner cases.

The reason we did this is to be able to differentiate between an error
code and an unsupported ioctl number; for unsupported ioctl numbers, the
main loop should keep going.

Maybe we should change this to a higher negative number, to avoid such
cases when/if we add more ioctl() handlers.
