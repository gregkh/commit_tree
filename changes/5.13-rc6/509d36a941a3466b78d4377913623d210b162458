MIPS: loongson64: fix bug when PAGE_SIZE > 16KB

When page size larger than 16KB, arguments "vaddr + size(16KB)" in
"ioremap_page_range(vaddr, vaddr + size,...)" called by
"add_legacy_isa_io" is not page-aligned.

As loongson64 needs at least page size 16KB to get rid of cache alias,
and "vaddr" is 64KB-aligned, and 64KB is largest page size supported,
rounding "size" up to PAGE_SIZE is enough for all page size supported.
