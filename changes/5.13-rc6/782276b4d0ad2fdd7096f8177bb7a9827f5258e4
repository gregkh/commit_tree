arm64: Force SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP as the only memory management model

Currently arm64 allows a choice of FLATMEM, SPARSEMEM and
SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP. However, only the latter is tested regularly. FLATMEM
does not seem to boot in certain configurations (guest under KVM with
Qemu as a VMM). Since the reduction of the SECTION_SIZE_BITS to 27 (4K
pages) or 29 (64K page), there's little argument against the memory
wasted by the mem_map array with SPARSEMEM.

Make SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP the only available option, non-selectable, and
remove the corresponding #ifdefs under arch/arm64/.
