coresight: Do not scan for graph if none is present

If a graph node is not found for a given node, of_get_next_endpoint()
will emit the following error message :

 OF: graph: no port node found in /<node_name>

If the given component doesn't have any explicit connections (e.g,
ETE) we could simply ignore the graph parsing. As for any legacy
component where this is mandatory, the device will not be usable
as before this patch. Updating the DT bindings to Yaml and enabling
the schema checks can detect such issues with the DT.
