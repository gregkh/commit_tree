platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Don't use global pmcdev in quirks

The DMI callbacks, used for quirks, currently access the PMC by getting
the address a global pmc_dev struct. Instead, have the callbacks set a
global quirk specific variable. In probe, after calling dmi_check_system(),
pass pmc_dev to a function that will handle each quirk if its variable
condition is met. This allows removing the global pmc_dev later.
