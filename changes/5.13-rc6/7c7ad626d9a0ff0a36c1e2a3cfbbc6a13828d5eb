sched/fair: Keep load_avg and load_sum synced

when removing a cfs_rq from the list we only check _sum value so we must
ensure that _avg and _sum stay synced so load_sum can't be null whereas
load_avg is not after propagating load in the cgroup hierarchy.

Use load_avg to compute load_sum similarly to what is done for util_sum
and runnable_sum.
