iio: set default trig->dev.parent

When allocated with [devm_]iio_trigger_alloc(), set trig device parent to
the device the trigger is allocated for by default.

It can always be reassigned in the probe routine.

Change iio_trigger_alloc() API to add the device pointer to be coherent
with devm_iio_trigger_alloc, using similar interface to
iio_device_alloc().
