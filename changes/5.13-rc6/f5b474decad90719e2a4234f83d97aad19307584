s390/configs: change CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE to "m"

In former times, the virtio-console code had to be compiled into
the kernel since the old guest virtio transport had some hard de-
pendencies. But since the old virtio transport has been removed in
commit 7fb2b2d51244 ("s390/virtio: remove the old KVM virtio transport"),
we do not have this limitation anymore.
Commit bb533ec8bacd ("s390/config: do not select VIRTIO_CONSOLE via
Kconfig") then also lifted the hard setting in the Kconfig system, so
we can finally switch the CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE knob to compile this
driver as a module now, making it more flexible for the user to only
load it if it is really required.
