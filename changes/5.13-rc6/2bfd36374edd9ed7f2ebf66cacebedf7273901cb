mm: vmscan: consolidate shrinker_maps handling code

The shrinker map management is not purely memcg specific, it is at the
intersection between memory cgroup and shrinkers.  It's allocation and
assignment of a structure, and the only memcg bit is the map is being
stored in a memcg structure.  So move the shrinker_maps handling code
into vmscan.c for tighter integration with shrinker code, and remove the
"memcg_" prefix.  There is no functional change.
