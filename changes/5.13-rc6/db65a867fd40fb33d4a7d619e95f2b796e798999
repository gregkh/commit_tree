lib/percpu_counter: tame kernel-doc compile warning

commit 3e8f399da490 ("writeback: rework wb_[dec|inc]_stat family of
functions") add some function description of percpu_counter_add_batch.
but the double '*' in comments means a kernel-doc format comment which
isn't right.

Since the whole file of lib/percpu_counter.c has no any other kernel-doc
format comments, we'd better to remove this incomplete one to tame the
kernel-doc warning:

lib/percpu_counter.c:83: warning: Function parameter or member 'fbc' not described in 'percpu_counter_add_batch'
lib/percpu_counter.c:83: warning: Function parameter or member 'amount' not described in 'percpu_counter_add_batch'
lib/percpu_counter.c:83: warning: Function parameter or member 'batch' not described in 'percpu_counter_add_batch'
