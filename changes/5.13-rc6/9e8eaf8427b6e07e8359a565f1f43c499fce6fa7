ionic: stop watchdog when in broken state

Up to now we've been ignoring any error return from the
queue starting in the link status check, so we fix that here.
If the driver had to reset and couldn't get things running
properly again, for example after a Tx Timeout and the FW is
not responding to commands, don't let the link watchdog try
to restart the queues.  At this point the user can try to DOWN
and UP the device to clear the errors.
