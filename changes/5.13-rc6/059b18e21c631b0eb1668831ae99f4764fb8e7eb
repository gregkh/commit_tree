selftests: mlxsw: Return correct error code in resource scale tests

Currently, the resource scale test checks a few cases, when the error code
resets between the cases. So for example, if one case fails and the
consecutive case passes, the error code eventually will fit the last test
and will be 0.

Save a new return code that will hold the 'or' return codes of all the
cases, so the final return code will consider all the cases.
