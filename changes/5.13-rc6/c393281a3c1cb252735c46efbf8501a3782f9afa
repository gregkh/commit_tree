ASoC: soc-pcm: add soc_hw_sanity_check()

Current soc_pcm_open() is checking runtime->hw parameters, but having
such function is very helpful for reading code.

This patch adds new soc_hw_sanity_check() and checks runtime->hw
parameters there. And print its debug message there, too.

Debug message print out timing is exchanged after this patch,
but it is not a big deal, because it is for debug.
