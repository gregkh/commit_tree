hwmon: (pmbus/fsp-3y) Fix FSP-3Y YH-5151E VOUT

After testing new YH-5151E devices, we found out that not all YH-5151E
work the same. The newly tested devices actually report vout correctly
in linear16 (even though they're still YH-5151E). We suspect that it is
because these new devices have a different firmware version, but that is
unconfirmed. The version cannot be queried through PMBus.

The compliant versions of YH-5151E report VOUT_MODE normally, so we turn
on the linear11 workaround only if VOUT_MODE doesn't report anything.
