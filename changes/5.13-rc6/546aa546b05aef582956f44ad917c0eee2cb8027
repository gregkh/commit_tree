drm/amdgpu: Add double-sscanf but invert

Add back the double-sscanf so that both decimal
and hexadecimal values could be read in, but this
time invert the scan so that hexadecimal format
with a leading 0x is tried first, and if that
fails, then try decimal format.

Also use a logical-AND instead of nesting double
if-conditional.

See commit "drm/amdgpu: Fix a bug for input with double sscanf"
