arm64: don't use GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER

In subsequent patches we want to allow irqchip drivers to register as
FIQ handlers, with a set_handle_fiq() function. To keep the IRQ/FIQ
paths similar, we want arm64 to provide both set_handle_irq() and
set_handle_fiq(), rather than using GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER for the
former.

This patch adds an arm64-specific implementation of set_handle_irq().
There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
