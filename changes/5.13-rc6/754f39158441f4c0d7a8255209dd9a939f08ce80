Revert "serial: mvebu-uart: Fix to avoid a potential NULL pointer dereference"

This reverts commit 32f47179833b63de72427131169809065db6745e.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be not be needed at all as the
change was useless because this function can only be called when
of_match_device matched on something.  So it should be reverted.
