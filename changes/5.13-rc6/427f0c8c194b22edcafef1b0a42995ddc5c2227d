macvlan: Add nodst option to macvlan type source

The default behavior for source MACVLAN is to duplicate packets to
appropriate type source devices, and then do the normal destination MACVLAN
flow. This patch adds an option to skip destination MACVLAN processing if
any matching source MACVLAN device has the option set.

This allows setting up a "catch all" device for source MACVLAN: create one
or more devices with type source nodst, and one device with e.g. type vepa,
and incoming traffic will be received on exactly one device.
