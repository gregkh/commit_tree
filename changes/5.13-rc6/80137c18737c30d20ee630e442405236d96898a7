usb: typec: tcpm: Fix misuses of AMS invocation

tcpm_ams_start is used to initiate an AMS as well as checking Collision
Avoidance conditions but not for flagging passive AMS (initiated by the
port partner). Fix the misuses of tcpm_ams_start in tcpm_pd_svdm.

ATTENTION doesn't need responses so the AMS flag is not needed here.
