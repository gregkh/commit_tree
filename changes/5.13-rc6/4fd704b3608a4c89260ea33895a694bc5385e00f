net: ipa: record number of groups in data

The arrays of source and destination resource limits defined in
configuration data are of a fixed size--which is the maximum number
of resource groups supported for any platform.  Most platforms will
use fewer than that many groups.

Add new members to the ipa_rsrc_group_id enumerated type to define
the number of source and destination resource groups are defined for
the platform.  (This type is defined for each platform in its data
file.)

Add a new field to the resource configuration data that indicates
how many of the source and destination resource groups are actually
used for the platform, and initialize it with the count value.  This
allows us to determine the number of groups defined for the platform
without exposing the ipa_rsrc_group_id enumerated type.

As a result, we no longer need ipa_resource_group_src_count()
and ipa_resource_group_dst_count(), because each platform now
defines its supported number of resource groups.  So get rid of
those two functions.
