serial: stm32: fix FIFO flush in startup and set_termios

Fifo flush set USART_RQR register by calling stm32_usart_set_bits
routine (Read/Modify/Write). USART_RQR register is a write only
register. So, read before write isn't correct / relevant to flush
the FIFOs.
Replace stm32_usart_set_bits call by writel_relaxed.
