iio: buffer-dma,adi-axi-adc: introduce devm_iio_dmaengine_buffer_setup()

This change does a conversion of the devm_iio_dmaengine_buffer_alloc() to
devm_iio_dmaengine_buffer_setup(). This will allocate an IIO DMA buffer and
attach it to the IIO device, similar to devm_iio_triggered_buffer_setup()
(though the underlying code is different, the final logic is the same).

Since the only user of the devm_iio_dmaengine_buffer_alloc() was the
adi-axi-adc driver, this change does the replacement in a single go in the
driver.
