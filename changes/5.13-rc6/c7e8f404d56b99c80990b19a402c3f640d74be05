pata_arasan_cf: fix IRQ check

The driver's probe() method is written as if platform_get_irq() returns 0
on error, while actually it returns a negative error code (with all the
other values considered valid IRQs). Rewrite the driver's IRQ checking code
to pass the positive IRQ #s to ata_host_activate(), propagate upstream
-EPROBE_DEFER, and set up the driver to polling mode on (negative) errors
and IRQ0 (libata treats IRQ #0 as a polling mode anyway)...
