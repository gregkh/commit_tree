usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the responses in SVDM Version 2.0 DFP

In USB PD Spec Rev 3.1 Ver 1.0, section "6.12.5 Applicability of
Structured VDM Commands", DFP is allowed and recommended to respond to
Discovery Identity with ACK. And in section "6.4.4.2.5.1 Commands other
than Attention", NAK should be returned only when receiving Messages
with invalid fields, Messages in wrong situation, or unrecognize
Messages.

Still keep the original design for SVDM Version 1.0 for backward
compatibilities.
