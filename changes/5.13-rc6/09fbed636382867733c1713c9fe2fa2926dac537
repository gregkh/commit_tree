nvme: export fast_io_fail_tmo to sysfs

Commit 8c4dfea97f15 ("nvme-fabrics: reject I/O to offline device")
introduced fast_io_fail_tmo but didn't export the value to sysfs. The
value can be set during the 'nvme connect'. Export the timeout value
to user space via sysfs to allow runtime configuration.
