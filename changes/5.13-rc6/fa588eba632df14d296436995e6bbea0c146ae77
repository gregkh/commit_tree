net: Add Qcom WWAN control driver

The MHI WWWAN control driver allows MHI QCOM-based modems to expose
different modem control protocols/ports via the WWAN framework, so that
userspace modem tools or daemon (e.g. ModemManager) can control WWAN
config and state (APN config, SMS, provider selection...). A QCOM-based
modem can expose one or several of the following protocols:
- AT: Well known AT commands interactive protocol (microcom, minicom...)
- MBIM: Mobile Broadband Interface Model (libmbim, mbimcli)
- QMI: QCOM MSM/Modem Interface (libqmi, qmicli)
- QCDM: QCOM Modem diagnostic interface (libqcdm)
- FIREHOSE: XML-based protocol for Modem firmware management
        (qmi-firmware-update)

Note that this patch is mostly a rework of the earlier MHI UCI
tentative that was a generic interface for accessing MHI bus from
userspace. As suggested, this new version is WWAN specific and is
dedicated to only expose channels used for controlling a modem, and
for which related opensource userpace support exist.
