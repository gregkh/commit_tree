f2fs: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of a flexible-array member in
struct f2fs_checkpoint, instead of a one-element arrays.

Notice that a temporary pointer to void '*tmp_ptr' was used in order to
fix the following errors when using a flexible array instead of a one
element array in struct f2fs_checkpoint:
