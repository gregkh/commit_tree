HID: asus: filter G713/G733 key event to prevent shutdown

The G713 and G733 both emit an unexpected keycode on some key
presses such as Fn+Pause. The device in this case is emitting
two events on key down, and 3 on key up, the third key up event
is report ID 0x02 and is unfiltered, causing incorrect event.

This patch filters out the single problematic event.
