regulator: core: resolve supply for boot-on/always-on regulators

For the boot-on/always-on regulators the set_machine_constrainst() is
called before resolving rdev->supply. Thus the code would try to enable
rdev before enabling supplying regulator. Enforce resolving supply
regulator before enabling rdev.
