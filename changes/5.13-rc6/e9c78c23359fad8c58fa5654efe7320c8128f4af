nvme-pci: remove the barriers in nvme_irq()

The barriers were added to the nvme_irq() in commit 3a7afd8ee42a
("nvme-pci: remove the CQ lock for interrupt driven queues") to prevent
compiler from doing memory optimization for the variabes that were
protected previously by spinlock in nvme_irq() at completion queue
processing and with queue head check condition.

The variable nvmeq->last_cq_head from those checks was removed in the
commit f6c4d97b0d82 ("nvme/pci: Remove last_cq_head") that was not
allwing poll queues from mistakenly triggering the spurious interrupt
detection.

Remove the barriers which were protecting the updates to the variables.
