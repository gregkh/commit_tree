perf stat: Introduce ':b' modifier

Introduce 'b' modifier to event parser, which means use BPF program to
manage this event. This is the same as --bpf-counters option, but only
applies to this event. For example,

  perf stat -e cycles:b,cs               # use bpf for cycles, but not cs
  perf stat -e cycles,cs --bpf-counters  # use bpf for both cycles and cs
