mmc: sdhci-s3c: constify uses of driver/match data

The driver data (struct sdhci_s3c_drv_data) stored in of_device_id
table is allocated as const and used only in const-way.  Skip
unnecessary const-away casts and convert all users to work with pointer
to const.  This is both more logical and safer.
