ALSA: hda/cirrus: Add Headphone and Headset MIC Volume Control

CS8409 does not support Volume Control for NIDs 0x24 (the Headphones),
or 0x34 (The Headset Mic).
However, CS42L42 codec does support gain control for both.
We can add support for Volume Controls, by writing the the CS42L42
regmap via i2c commands, using custom info, get and put volume
functions, saved in the control.

Tested on DELL Inspiron-3500, DELL Inspiron-3501, DELL Inspiron-3500
