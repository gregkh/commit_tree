ALSA: virtio: handling control and I/O messages for the PCM device

The driver implements a message-based transport for I/O substream
operations. Before the start of the substream, the hardware buffer is
sliced into I/O messages, the number of which is equal to the current
number of periods. The size of each message is equal to the current
size of one period.

I/O messages are organized in an ordered queue. The completion of the
I/O message indicates an elapsed period (the only exception is the end
of the stream for the capture substream). Upon completion, the message
is automatically re-added to the end of the queue.
