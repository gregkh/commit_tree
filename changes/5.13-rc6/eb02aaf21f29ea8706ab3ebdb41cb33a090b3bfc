usb: xhci: Rewrite xhci_create_usb3_bos_desc()

The current xhci_create_usb3_bos_desc() uses a static bos u8 array and
various magic numbers and offsets making it difficult to extend support
for USB 3.2. Let's rewrite this entire function to support dual-lane in
USB 3.2.

The hub driver matches the port speed ID from the extended port status
to the SSID of the sublink speed attributes to detect if the device
supports SuperSpeed Plus. Currently we don't provide the default gen1x2
and gen2x2 sublink speed capability descriptor for USB 3.2 roothub. The
USB stack depends on this to detect and match the correct speed.
In addition, if the xHCI host provides Protocol Speed ID (PSI)
capability, then make sure to convert Protocol Speed ID Mantissa and
Exponent (PSIM & PSIE) to lane speed for gen1x2 and gen2x2.
