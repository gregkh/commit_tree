PCI: xilinx: Don't allocate extra memory for the MSI capture address

A long cargo-culted behaviour of PCI drivers is to allocate memory
to obtain an address that is fed to the controller as the MSI
capture address (i.e. the MSI doorbell).

But there is no actual requirement for this address to be RAM.
All it needs to be is a suitable aligned address that will
*not* be DMA'd to.

Use the physical address of the 'port' data structure as the MSI
capture address, aligned on a 4K boundary.
