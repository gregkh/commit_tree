tools headers cpufeatures: Sync with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  fb35d30fe5b06cc2 ("x86/cpufeatures: Assign dedicated feature word for CPUID_0x8000001F[EAX]")
  e7b6385b01d8e9fb ("x86/cpufeatures: Add Intel SGX hardware bits")
  1478b99a76534b6c ("x86/cpufeatures: Mark ENQCMD as disabled when configured out")

That don't cause any change in the tools, just silences this perf build
warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h'
