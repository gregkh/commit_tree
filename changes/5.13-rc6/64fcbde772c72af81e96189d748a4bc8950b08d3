drm/msm: Track potentially evictable objects

Objects that are potential for swapping out are (1) willneed (ie. if
they are purgable/MADV_WONTNEED we can just free the pages without them
having to land in swap), (2) not on an active list, (3) not dma-buf
imported or exported, and (4) not vmap'd.  This repurposes the purged
list for objects that do not have backing pages (either because they
have not been pinned for the first time yet, or in a later patch because
they have been unpinned/evicted.
