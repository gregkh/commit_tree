kconfig: do not use allnoconfig_y option

allnoconfig_y is an ugly hack that sets a symbol to 'y' by allnoconfig.

allnoconfig does not mean a minimal set of CONFIG options because a
bunch of prompts are hidden by 'if EMBEDDED' or 'if EXPERT', but I do
not like to hack Kconfig this way.

Use the pre-existing feature, KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG, to provide a one
liner config fragment. CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y is still forced when
allnoconfig is invoked as a part of tinyconfig.

No change in the .config file produced by 'make tinyconfig'.

The output of 'make allnoconfig' will be changed; we will get
CONFIG_EMBEDDED=n because allnoconfig literally sets all symbols to n.
