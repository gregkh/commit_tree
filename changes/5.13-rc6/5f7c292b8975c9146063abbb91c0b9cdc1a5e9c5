KVM: Move prototypes for MMU notifier callbacks to generic code

Move the prototypes for the MMU notifier callbacks out of arch code and
into common code.  There is no benefit to having each arch replicate the
prototypes since any deviation from the invocation in common code will
explode.

No functional change intended.
