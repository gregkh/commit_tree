platform: x86: ACPI: Get rid of ACPICA message printing

A few x86 platform drivers use ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() or ACPI_EXCEPTION()
for printing messages, but that is questionable, because those macros
belong to ACPICA and they should not be used elsewhere.  In addition,
ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() requires special enabling to allow it to actually
print the message, which is a nuisance, and the _COMPONENT symbol
generally needed for that is not defined in any of the files in
question.

For this reason, replace the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() in lg-laptop.c with
pr_debug() and the one in xo15-ebook.c with acpi_handle_debug()
(with the additional benefit that the source object can be identified
more easily after this change).

Also drop the ACPI_MODULE_NAME() definitions that are only used by
the ACPICA message printing macros from those files and from wmi.c
and surfacepro3_button.c (while at it).
