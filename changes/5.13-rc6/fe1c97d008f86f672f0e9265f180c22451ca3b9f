drm/amd/display: Initialize attribute for hdcp_srm sysfs file

It is stored in dynamically allocated memory, so sysfs_bin_attr_init() must
be called to initialize it. (Note: "initialization" only sets the .attr.key
member in this struct; it does not change the value of any other members.)

Otherwise, when CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y this message appears during boot:

    BUG: key ffff9248900cd148 has not been registered!
