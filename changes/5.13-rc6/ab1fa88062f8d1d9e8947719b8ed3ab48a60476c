scsi: zfcp: Fix sysfs roll-back on error in zfcp_adapter_enqueue()

When zfcp_adapter_enqueue() fails to create the zfcp_sysfs_adapter_attrs
group, it calls zfcp_adapter_unregister() to tear down the adapter state
again. This then unconditionally attempts to remove the
zfcp_sysfs_adapter_attrs group, resulting in a "group not found" WARN from
sysfs code.

Avoid this by copying most of zfcp_adapter_unregister() into the error
path, allowing for more fine-granular roll-back. Then skip the sysfs
tear-down steps if we haven't progressed this far in the initialization.
