dt-bindings: serial: samsung: include generic dtschema to match bluetooth child

Include the generic serial.yaml dtschema so the child node like
"bluetooth" will be properly matched:

  arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4210-universal_c210.dt.yaml:
    serial@13800000: 'bluetooth' does not match any of the regexes: 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'
