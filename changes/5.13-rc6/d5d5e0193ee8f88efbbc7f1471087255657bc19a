net: hns3: add handling for xmit skb with recursive fraglist

Currently hns3 driver only handle the xmit skb with one level of
fraglist skb, add handling for multi level by calling hns3_tx_bd_num()
recursively when calculating bd num and calling hns3_fill_skb_to_desc()
recursively when filling tx desc.

When the skb has a fraglist level of 24, the skb is simply dropped and
stats.max_recursion_level is added to record the error. Move the stat
handling from hns3_nic_net_xmit() to hns3_nic_maybe_stop_tx() in order
to handle different error stat and add the 'max_recursion_level' and
'hw_limitation' stat.

Note that the max recursive level as 24 is chose according to below:
commit 48a1df65334b ("skbuff: return -EMSGSIZE in skb_to_sgvec to
prevent overflow").

And that we are not able to find a testcase to verify the recursive
fraglist case, so Fixes tag is not provided.
