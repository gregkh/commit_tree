media: mantis: remove orphan mantis_core.c

There is no Makefile rule to have drivers/media/pci/mantis/mantis_core.o
in build since the code overhaul with commit b3b961448f70
("V4L/DVB (13795): [Mantis/Hopper] Code overhaul, add Hopper devices into the PCI ID list").

It looks like drivers/media/pci/mantis/mantis_core.c is a leftover.

Remove the orphan code.
