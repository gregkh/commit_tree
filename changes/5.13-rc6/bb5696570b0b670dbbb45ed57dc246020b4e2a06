net/mlx5e: Reject tc rules which redirect from a VF to itself

Since there are self loopback prevention mechanisms at the
VF level, offloading such rules which redirect from a VF
to itself in the eswitch will break the datapath since the
packets will be dropped once they go back to the vport they
came from.

Therefore, offloading such rules will be rejected and left to
be handled by SW.
