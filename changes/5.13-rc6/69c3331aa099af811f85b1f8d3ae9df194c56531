staging: rtl8723bs: replace dump_drv_version() usage with netdev_dbg()

replace dump_drv_version() usage with netdev_dbg().

There's no need to further wrap a netdev_dbg() call
for such a low number of occurrences.

The string printed is the same contained in DBG_871X_SEL_NL macro
called inside dump_drv_version().

This is just preparation before bulk DBG_871X_SEL_NL macro
replacement by coccinelle, as the semantic patch that will be
used just replaces, doesn't remove.
