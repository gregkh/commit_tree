drm/tegra: Fix shift overflow in tegra_shared_plane_atomic_update

Clang warns:

drivers/gpu/drm/tegra/hub.c:513:11: warning: shift count >= width of
type [-Wshift-count-overflow]
                base |= BIT(39);
                        ^~~~~~~

BIT is unsigned long, which is 32-bit on ARCH=arm, hence the overflow
warning. Switch to BIT_ULL, which is 64-bit and will not overflow.
