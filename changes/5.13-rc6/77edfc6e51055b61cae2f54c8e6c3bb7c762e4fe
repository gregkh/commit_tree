exfat: fix erroneous discard when clear cluster bit

If mounted with discard option, exFAT issues discard command when clear
cluster bit to remove file. But the input parameter of cluster-to-sector
calculation is abnormally added by reserved cluster size which is 2,
leading to discard unrelated sectors included in target+2 cluster.
With fixing this, remove the wrong comments in set/clear/find bitmap
functions.
