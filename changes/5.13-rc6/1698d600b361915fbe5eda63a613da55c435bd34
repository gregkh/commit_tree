bnxt_en: Implement .ndo_features_check().

For UDP encapsultions, we only support the offloaded Vxlan port and
Geneve port.  All other ports included FOU and GUE are not supported so
we need to turn off TSO and checksum features.

v2: Reverse the check for supported UDP ports to be more straight forward.
