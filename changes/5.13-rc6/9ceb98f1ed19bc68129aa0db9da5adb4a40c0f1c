ARM: dts: rockchip: add new watchdog compatible to rk322x.dtsi

The watchdog compatible strings are suppose to be SoC orientated.
In the more recently added Rockchip rk322x.dtsi file only
the fallback string "snps,dw-wdt" is used, so add the new
compatible string:

"rockchip,rk3228-wdt", "snps,dw-wdt"

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/watchdog/snps,dw-wdt.yaml
