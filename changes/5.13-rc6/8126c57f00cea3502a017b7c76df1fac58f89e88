torture: Make jitter.sh handle large systems

The current jitter.sh script expects cpumask bits to fit into whatever
the awk interpreter uses for an integer, which clearly does not hold for
even medium-sized systems these days.  This means that on a large system,
only the first 32 or 64 CPUs (depending) are subjected to jitter.sh
CPU-time perturbations.  This commit therefore computes a given CPU's
cpumask using text manipulation rather than arithmetic shifts.
