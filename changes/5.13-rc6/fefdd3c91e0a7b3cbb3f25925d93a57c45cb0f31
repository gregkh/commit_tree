mmc: core: Drop superfluous validations in mmc_hw|sw_reset()

The mmc_hw|sw_reset() APIs are designed to be called solely from upper
layers, which means drivers that operates on top of the struct mmc_card,
like the mmc block device driver and an SDIO functional driver.

Additionally, as long as the struct mmc_host has a valid pointer to a
struct mmc_card, the corresponding host->bus_ops pointer stays valid and
assigned.

For these reasons, let's drop the superfluous reference counting and the
redundant validations in mmc_hw|sw_reset().
