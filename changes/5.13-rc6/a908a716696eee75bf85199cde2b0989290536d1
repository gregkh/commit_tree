ASoC/extcon: arizona: Move arizona jack code to sound/soc/codecs/arizona-jack.c

The jack handling for arizona codecs is being refactored so that it is
done directly by the codec drivers, instead of having an extcon-driver
bind to a separate "arizona-extcon" child-device for this.

drivers/mfd/arizona-core.c has already been updated to no longer
instantiate an "arizona-extcon" child-device for the arizona codecs.

This means that the "arizona-extcon" driver is no longer useful
(there are no longer any devices for it to bind to).

This commit drops the extcon Kconfig / Makefile bits and moves
drivers/extcon/extcon-arizona.c to sound/soc/codecs/arizona-jack.c .

This is a preparation patch for converting the arizona extcon-driver into
a helper library for letting the arizona codec-drivers directly report jack
state through the standard sound/soc/soc-jack.c functions.
