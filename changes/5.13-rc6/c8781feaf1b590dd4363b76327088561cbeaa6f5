KVM: SVM: Skip intercepted PAUSE instructions after emulation

Skip PAUSE after interception to avoid unnecessarily re-executing the
instruction in the guest, e.g. after regaining control post-yield.
This is a benign bug as KVM disables PAUSE interception if filtering is
off, including the case where pause_filter_count is set to zero.
