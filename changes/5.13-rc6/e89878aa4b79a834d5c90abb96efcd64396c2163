bus: mhi: pci_generic: Use generic PCI power management

The PCI core can take care of proper PCI suspend/resume operations, but
this is discarded when the driver saves PCI state by its own. This
currently prevents the PCI core to enable PME (for modem initiated
D3 exit) which is requested for proper runtime pm support.

This change deletes explicit PCI state-saving and state-set from
suspend callback, letting the PCI doing the appropriate work.
