mmc: block: Issue a cache flush only when it's enabled

In command queueing mode, the cache isn't flushed via the mmc_flush_cache()
function, but instead by issuing a CMDQ_TASK_MGMT (CMD48) with a
FLUSH_CACHE opcode. In this path, we need to check if cache has been
enabled, before deciding to flush the cache, along the lines of what's
being done in mmc_flush_cache().

To fix this problem, let's add a new bus ops callback ->cache_enabled() and
implement it for the mmc bus type. In this way, the mmc block device driver
can call it to know whether cache flushing should be done.
