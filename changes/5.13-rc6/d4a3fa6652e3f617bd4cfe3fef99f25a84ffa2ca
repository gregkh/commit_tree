media: dvb-frontends: lgdt3306a.c: remove dead code

Fix the following coccinelle report:

drivers/media/dvb-frontends/lgdt3306a.c:718:5-8:
Unneeded variable: "ret". Return "0" on line 744

Code was enclosed with #if 0 and thus this variable was not needed.
Remove that function altogether.

The  lgdt3306a_spectral_inversion function was dropped completely
since the function doesn't do anything. A comment was left at its
calling site to let others know that spectral_inversion defaults
already set for VSB and QAM
