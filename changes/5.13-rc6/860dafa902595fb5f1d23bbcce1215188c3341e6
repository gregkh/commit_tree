vt: Fix character height handling with VT_RESIZEX

Restore the original intent of the VT_RESIZEX ioctl's `v_clin' parameter
which is the number of pixel rows per character (cell) rather than the
height of the font used.

For framebuffer devices the two values are always the same, because the
former is inferred from the latter one.  For VGA used as a true text
mode device these two parameters are independent from each other: the
number of pixel rows per character is set in the CRT controller, while
font height is in fact hardwired to 32 pixel rows and fonts of heights
below that value are handled by padding their data with blanks when
loaded to hardware for use by the character generator.  One can change
the setting in the CRT controller and it will update the screen contents
accordingly regardless of the font loaded.

The `v_clin' parameter is used by the `vgacon' driver to set the height
of the character cell and then the cursor position within.  Make the
parameter explicit then, by defining a new `vc_cell_height' struct
member of `vc_data', set it instead of `vc_font.height' from `v_clin' in
the VT_RESIZEX ioctl, and then use it throughout the `vgacon' driver
except where actual font data is accessed which as noted above is
independent from the CRTC setting.

This way the framebuffer console driver is free to ignore the `v_clin'
parameter as irrelevant, as it always should have, avoiding any issues
attempts to give the parameter a meaning there could have caused, such
as one that has led to commit 988d0763361b ("vt_ioctl: make VT_RESIZEX
behave like VT_RESIZE"):

 "syzbot is reporting UAF/OOB read at bit_putcs()/soft_cursor() [1][2],
  for vt_resizex() from ioctl(VT_RESIZEX) allows setting font height
  larger than actual font height calculated by con_font_set() from
  ioctl(PIO_FONT). Since fbcon_set_font() from con_font_set() allocates
  minimal amount of memory based on actual font height calculated by
  con_font_set(), use of vt_resizex() can cause UAF/OOB read for font
  data."

The problem first appeared around Linux 2.5.66 which predates our repo
history, but the origin could be identified with the old MIPS/Linux repo
also at: <git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ralf/linux.git>
as commit 9736a3546de7 ("Merge with Linux 2.5.66."), where VT_RESIZEX
code in `vt_ioctl' was updated as follows:

 		if (clin)
-			video_font_height = clin;
+			vc->vc_font.height = clin;

making the parameter apply to framebuffer devices as well, perhaps due
to the use of "font" in the name of the original `video_font_height'
variable.  Use "cell" in the new struct member then to avoid ambiguity.
