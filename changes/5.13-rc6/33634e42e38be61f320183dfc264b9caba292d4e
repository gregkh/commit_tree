x86/paravirt: Remove no longer needed 32-bit pvops cruft

PVOP_VCALL4() is only used for Xen PV, while PVOP_CALL4() isn't used
at all. Keep PVOP_CALL4() for 64 bits due to symmetry reasons.

This allows to remove the 32-bit definitions of those macros leading
to a substantial simplification of the paravirt macros, as those were
the only ones needing non-empty "pre" and "post" parameters.

PVOP_CALLEE2() and PVOP_VCALLEE2() are used nowhere, so remove them.

Another no longer needed case is special handling of return types
larger than unsigned long. Replace that with a BUILD_BUG_ON().

DISABLE_INTERRUPTS() is used in 32-bit code only, so it can just be
replaced by cli.

INTERRUPT_RETURN in 32-bit code can be replaced by iret.

ENABLE_INTERRUPTS is used nowhere, so it can be removed.
