rtc: pcf85063: fallback to parent of_node

The rtc device node is always NULL.

Since v5.12-rc1-dontuse/3c9ea42802a1fbf7ef29660ff8c6e526c58114f6 this
will lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

To fix this use the parent node which is the i2c client node as set by
devm_rtc_allocate_device().

Using the i2c client node seems to be what other similar drivers do
e.g. rtc-pcf8563.c.
