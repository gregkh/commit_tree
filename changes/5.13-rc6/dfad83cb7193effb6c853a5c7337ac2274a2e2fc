MIPS: Add support for CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL

Provide hooks to intercept bad usages of virt_to_phys() and
__pa_symbol() throughout the kernel. To make this possible, we need to
rename the current implement of virt_to_phys() into
__virt_to_phys_nodebug() and wrap it around depending on
CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL.

A similar thing is needed for __pa_symbol() which is now aliased to
__phys_addr_symbol() whose implementation is either the direct return of
RELOC_HIDE or goes through the debug version.
