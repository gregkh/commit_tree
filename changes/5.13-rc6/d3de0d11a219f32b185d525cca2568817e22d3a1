scsi: lpfc: Fix lpfc_hdw_queue attribute being ignored

The lpfc_hdw_queue attribute is to set the number of hardware queues to be
created on the adapter. Normally, the value is set to a default, which
allows the hw queue count to be sized dynamically based on adapter
capabilities, CPU/platform architecture, or CPU type. Currently, when
lpfc_hdw_queue is set to a specific value, is has no effect and the dynamic
sizing occurs.

The routine checking whether parameters are default or not ignores the
lpfc_hdw_queue setting and invokes the dynamic logic.

Fix the routine to additionally check the lpfc_hdw_queue attribute value
before using dynamic scaling. Additionally, SLI-3 supports only a small
number of queues with dedicated functions, thus it needs to be exempted
from the variable scaling and set to the expected values.
