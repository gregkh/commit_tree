bus: mhi: core: Clear context for stopped channels from remove()

If a channel was explicitly stopped but not reset and a driver
remove is issued, clean up the channel context such that it is
reflected on the device. This move is useful if a client driver
module is unloaded or a device crash occurs with the host having
placed the channel in a stopped state.
