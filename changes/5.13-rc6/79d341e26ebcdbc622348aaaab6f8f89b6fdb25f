platform/x86: hp_accel: Avoid invoking _INI to speed up resume

hp_accel can take almost two seconds to resume on some HP laptops.

The bottleneck is on evaluating _INI, which is only needed to run once.

Resolve the issue by only invoking _INI when it's necessary. Namely, on
probe and on hibernation restore.
