dpaa2-eth: rename dpaa2_eth_xdp_release_buf into dpaa2_eth_recycle_buf

Rename the dpaa2_eth_xdp_release_buf function into dpaa2_eth_recycle_buf
since in the next patches we'll be using the same recycle mechanism for
the normal stack path beside for XDP_DROP.

Also, rename the array which holds the buffers to be recycled so that it
does not have any reference to XDP.
