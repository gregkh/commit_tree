pinctrl: use to octal permissions for debugfs files

Switch over pinctrl debugfs files to use octal permissions as they are
preferred over symbolic permissions. Refer to commit f90774e1fd27
("checkpatch: look for symbolic permissions and suggest octal instead").

Note: S_IFREG flag is added to the mode by __debugfs_create_file()
in fs/debugfs/inode.c
