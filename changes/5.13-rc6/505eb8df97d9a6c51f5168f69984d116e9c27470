extcon: arizona: Always use pm_runtime_get_sync() when we need the device to be awake

Before this commit the extcon-arizona code was mixing pm_runtime_get()
and pm_runtime_get_sync() in different places.

In all places where pm_runtime_get[_sync]() is called, the code
makes use of the device immediately after the call.
This means that we should always use pm_runtime_get_sync().
