selftests/bpf: Silence clang compilation warnings

With clang compiler:
  make -j60 LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1  <=== compile kernel
  make -j60 -C tools/testing/selftests/bpf LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1
Some linker flags are not used/effective for some binaries and
we have warnings like:
  warning: -lelf: 'linker' input unused [-Wunused-command-line-argument]

We also have warnings like:
  .../selftests/bpf/prog_tests/ns_current_pid_tgid.c:74:57: note: treat the string as an argument to avoid this
        if (CHECK(waitpid(cpid, &wstatus, 0) == -1, "waitpid", strerror(errno)))
                                                               ^
                                                               "%s",
  .../selftests/bpf/test_progs.h:129:35: note: expanded from macro 'CHECK'
        _CHECK(condition, tag, duration, format)
                                         ^
  .../selftests/bpf/test_progs.h:108:21: note: expanded from macro '_CHECK'
                fprintf(stdout, ##format);                              \
                                  ^
The first warning can be silenced with clang option -Wno-unused-command-line-argument.
For the second warning, source codes are modified as suggested by the compiler
to silence the warning. Since gcc does not support the option
-Wno-unused-command-line-argument and the warning only happens with clang
compiler, the option -Wno-unused-command-line-argument is enabled only when
clang compiler is used.
