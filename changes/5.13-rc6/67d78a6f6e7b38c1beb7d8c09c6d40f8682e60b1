afs: Pass page into dirty region helpers to provide THP size

Pass a pointer to the page being accessed into the dirty region helpers so
that the size of the page can be determined in case it's a transparent huge
page.

This also required the page to be passed into the afs_page_dirty trace
point - so there's no need to specifically pass in the index or private
data as these can be retrieved directly from the page struct.
