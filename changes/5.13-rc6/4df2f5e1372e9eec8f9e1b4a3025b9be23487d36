spi: imx: add a check for speed_hz before calculating the clock

When some drivers use spi to send data, spi_transfer->speed_hz is
not assigned. If spidev->max_speed_hz is not assigned as well, it
will cause an error in configuring the clock.
Add a check for these two values before configuring the clock. An
error will be returned when they are not assigned.
