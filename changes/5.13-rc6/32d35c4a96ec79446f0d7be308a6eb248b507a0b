perf/x86: Allow for 8<num_fixed_counters<16

The 64 bit value read from MSR_ARCH_PERFMON_FIXED_CTR_CTRL is being
bit-wise masked with the value (0x03 << i*4). However, the shifted value
is evaluated using 32 bit arithmetic, so will UB when i > 8. Fix this
by making 0x03 a ULL so that the shift is performed using 64 bit
arithmetic.

This makes the arithmetic internally consistent and preparers for the
day when hardware provides 8<num_fixed_counters<16.
