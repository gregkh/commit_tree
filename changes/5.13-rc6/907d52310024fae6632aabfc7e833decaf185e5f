block: add queue_to_disk() to get gendisk from request_queue

Sometimes we need to get the corresponding gendisk from request_queue.

It is preferred that block drivers store private data in
gendisk->private_data rather than request_queue->queuedata, e.g. see:
commit c4a59c4e5db3 ("dm: stop using ->queuedata").

So if only request_queue is given, we need to get its corresponding
gendisk to get the private data stored in that gendisk.
