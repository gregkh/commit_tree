IB/qib: Remove redundant assignment to ret

Variable 'ret' is set to zero but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant assignment
and can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/infiniband/hw/qib/qib_sd7220.c:690:2: warning: Value stored to
'ret' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
