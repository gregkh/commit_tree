drm/i915: Take reservation lock around i915_vma_pin.

We previously complained when ww == NULL.

This function is now only used in selftests to pin an object,
and ww locking is now fixed.

[danvet: Resolve conflict because we don't have a set-domain refactor,

The really worrying thing here is that the above patch had a change in
arguments for i915_gem_object_set_to_gtt_domain(), without any
explanation. I decided to just faithfully apply Maarten's change but
not the argument change which was in Maarten's context diff.]
