powerpc/64s: Fix hash fault to use TRAP accessor

Hash faults use the trap vector to decide whether this is an
instruction or data fault. This should use the TRAP accessor
rather than open access regs->trap.

This won't cause a problem at the moment because 64s only uses
trap flags for system call interrupts (the norestart flag), but
that could change if any other trap flags get used in future.
