scsi: core: Put .shost_dev in failure path if host state changes to RUNNING

scsi_host_dev_release() only frees dev_name when host state is
SHOST_CREATED. After host state has changed to SHOST_RUNNING,
scsi_host_dev_release() no longer cleans up.

Fix this by doing a put_device(&shost->shost_dev) in the failure path when
host state is SHOST_RUNNING. Move get_device(&shost->shost_gendev) before
device_add(&shost->shost_dev) so that scsi_host_cls_release() can do a put
on this reference.
