x86/cpufeatures: Add SGX1 and SGX2 sub-features

Add SGX1 and SGX2 feature flags, via CPUID.0x12.0x0.EAX, as scattered
features, since adding a new leaf for only two bits would be wasteful.
As part of virtualizing SGX, KVM will expose the SGX CPUID leafs to its
guest, and to do so correctly needs to query hardware and kernel support
for SGX1 and SGX2.

Suppress both SGX1 and SGX2 from /proc/cpuinfo. SGX1 basically means
SGX, and for SGX2 there is no concrete use case of using it in
/proc/cpuinfo.
