bus: mhi: core: Check channel execution environment before issuing reset

A client can attempt to unprepare certain channels for transfer even
after the execution environment they are supposed to run in has changed.
In the event that happens, the device need not be notified of the reset
and the host can proceed with clean up for the channel context and
memory allocated for it on the host as the device will no longer be able
to respond to such a request.
