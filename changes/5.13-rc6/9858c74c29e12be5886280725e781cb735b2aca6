HID: a4tech: use A4_2WHEEL_MOUSE_HACK_B8 for A4TECH NB-95

This mouse has a horizontal wheel that requires special handling.
Without this patch, the horizontal wheel acts like a vertical wheel.

In the output of `hidrd-convert` for this mouse, there is a
`Usage (B8h)` field. It corresponds to a byte in packets sent by the
device that specifies which wheel generated an input event.

The name "A4TECH" is spelled in all capitals on the company website.
