drm/msm/mdp5: Do not multiply vclk line count by 100

Neither vtotal nor drm_mode_vrefresh contain a value that is
premultiplied by 100 making the x100 variable name incorrect and
resulting in vclks_line to become 100 times larger than it is supposed
to be.  The hardware counts 100 clockticks too many before tearcheck,
leading to severe panel issues on at least the Sony Xperia lineup.

This is likely an artifact from the original MDSS DSI panel driver where
the calculation [1] corrected for a premultiplied reference framerate by
100 [2].  It does not appear that the above values were ever
premultiplied in the history of the DRM MDP5 driver.

With this change applied the value written to the SYNC_CONFIG_VSYNC
register is now identical to downstream kernels.
