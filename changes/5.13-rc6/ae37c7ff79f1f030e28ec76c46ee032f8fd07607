mm: make alloc_contig_range handle in-use hugetlb pages

alloc_contig_range() will fail if it finds a HugeTLB page within the
range, without a chance to handle them.  Since HugeTLB pages can be
migrated as any LRU or Movable page, it does not make sense to bail out
without trying.  Enable the interface to recognize in-use HugeTLB pages so
we can migrate them, and have much better chances to succeed the call.
