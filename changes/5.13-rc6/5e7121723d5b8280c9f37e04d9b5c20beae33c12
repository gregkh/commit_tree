USB: xhci: drop workaround for forced irq threading

Force-threaded interrupt handlers used to run with interrupts enabled,
something which could lead to deadlocks in case a threaded handler
shared a lock with code running in hard interrupt context (e.g. timer
callbacks) and did not explicitly disable interrupts.

Since commit 81e2073c175b ("genirq: Disable interrupts for force
threaded handlers") interrupt handlers always run with interrupts
disabled on non-RT so that drivers no longer need to do handle forced
threading ("threadirqs").

Drop the now obsolete workaround added by commit 63aea0dbab90 ("USB:
xhci: fix lock-inversion problem").
