scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()

After device is initialized via device_initialize(), or its name is set via
dev_set_name(), the device has to be freed via put_device().  Otherwise
device name will be leaked because it is allocated dynamically in
dev_set_name().

Fix the leak by replacing kfree() with put_device(). Since
scsi_host_dev_release() properly handles IDA and kthread removal, remove
special-casing these from the error handling as well.
