mmc: renesas_sdhi: Fix HS400 on R-Car M3-W+

R-Car M3-W ES3.0 is marketed as R-Car M3-W+ (R8A77961), and has its own
compatible value "renesas,r8a77961".

Hence using soc_device_match() with soc_id = "r8a7796" and revision =
"ES3.*" does not actually match running on an R-Car M3-W+ SoC.

Fix this by matching with soc_id = "r8a77961" instead.
