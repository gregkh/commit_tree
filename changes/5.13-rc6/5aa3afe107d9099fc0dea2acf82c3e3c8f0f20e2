net: make unregister netdev warning timeout configurable

netdev_wait_allrefs() issues a warning if refcount does not drop to 0
after 10 seconds. While 10 second wait generally should not happen
under normal workload in normal environment, it seems to fire falsely
very often during fuzzing and/or in qemu emulation (~10x slower).
At least it's not possible to understand if it's really a false
positive or not. Automated testing generally bumps all timeouts
to very high values to avoid flake failures.
Add net.core.netdev_unregister_timeout_secs sysctl to make
the timeout configurable for automated testing systems.
Lowering the timeout may also be useful for e.g. manual bisection.
The default value matches the current behavior.
