perf: Add support for event removal on exec

Adds bit perf_event_attr::remove_on_exec, to support removing an event
from a task on exec.

This option supports the case where an event is supposed to be
process-wide only, and should not propagate beyond exec, to limit
monitoring to the original process image only.
