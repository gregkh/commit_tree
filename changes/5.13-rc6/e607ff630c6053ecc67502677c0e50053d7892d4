MIPS: generic: Update node names to avoid unit addresses

With the latest mkimage from U-Boot 2021.04, the generic defconfigs no
longer build, failing with:

/usr/bin/mkimage: verify_header failed for FIT Image support with exit code 1

This is expected after the linked U-Boot commits because '@' is
forbidden in the node names due to the way that libfdt treats nodes with
the same prefix but different unit addresses.

Switch the '@' in the node name to '-'. Drop the unit addresses from the
hash and kernel child nodes because there is only one node so they do
not need to have a number to differentiate them.
