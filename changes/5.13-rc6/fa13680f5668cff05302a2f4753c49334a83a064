KVM: SVM: Disable SEV/SEV-ES if NPT is disabled

Disable SEV and SEV-ES if NPT is disabled.  While the APM doesn't clearly
state that NPT is mandatory, it's alluded to by:

  The guest page tables, managed by the guest, may mark data memory pages
  as either private or shared, thus allowing selected pages to be shared
  outside the guest.

And practically speaking, shadow paging can't work since KVM can't read
the guest's page tables.
