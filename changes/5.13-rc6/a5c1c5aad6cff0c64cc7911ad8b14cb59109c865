KVM: SVM: Drop redundant svm_sev_enabled() helper

Replace calls to svm_sev_enabled() with direct checks on sev_enabled, or
in the case of svm_mem_enc_op, simply drop the call to svm_sev_enabled().
This effectively replaces checks against a valid max_sev_asid with checks
against sev_enabled.  sev_enabled is forced off by sev_hardware_setup()
if max_sev_asid is invalid, all call sites are guaranteed to run after
sev_hardware_setup(), and all of the checks care about SEV being fully
enabled (as opposed to intentionally handling the scenario where
max_sev_asid is valid but SEV enabling fails due to OOM).
