x86/build: Disable HIGHMEM64G selection for M486SX

Fix a regression caused by making the 486SX separately selectable in
Kconfig, for which the HIGHMEM64G setting has not been updated and
therefore has become exposed as a user-selectable option for the M486SX
configuration setting unlike with original M486 and all the other
settings that choose non-PAE-enabled processors:

  High Memory Support
  > 1. off (NOHIGHMEM)
    2. 4GB (HIGHMEM4G)
    3. 64GB (HIGHMEM64G)
  choice[1-3?]:

With the fix in place the setting is now correctly removed:

  High Memory Support
  > 1. off (NOHIGHMEM)
    2. 4GB (HIGHMEM4G)
  choice[1-2?]:
