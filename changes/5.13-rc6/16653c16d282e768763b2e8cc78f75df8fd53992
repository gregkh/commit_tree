net: qualcomm: rmnet: use masks instead of C bit-fields

The actual layout of bits defined in C bit-fields (e.g. int foo : 3)
is implementation-defined.  Structures defined in <linux/if_rmnet.h>
address this by specifying all bit-fields twice, to cover two
possible layouts.

I think this pattern is repetitive and noisy, and I find the whole
notion of compiler "bitfield endianness" to be non-intuitive.

Stop using C bit-fields for the command/data flag and the pad length
fields in the rmnet_map structure, and define a single-byte flags
field instead.  Define a mask for the single-bit "command" flag,
and another mask for the encoded pad length.  The content of both
fields can be accessed using a simple bitwise AND operation.
