KVM: x86/mmu: Use 'end' param in TDP MMU's test_age_gfn()

Use the @end param when aging a GFN instead of hardcoding the walk to a
single GFN.  Unlike tdp_set_spte(), which simply cannot work with more
than one GFN, aging multiple GFNs would not break, though admittedly it
would be weird.  Be nice to the casual reader and don't make them puzzle
out why the end GFN is unused.

No functional change intended.
