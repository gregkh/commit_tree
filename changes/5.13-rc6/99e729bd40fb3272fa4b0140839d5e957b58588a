ia64: module: fix symbolizer crash on fdescr

Noticed failure as a crash on ia64 when tried to symbolize all backtraces
collected by page_owner=on:

    $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/page_owner
    <oops>

    CPU: 1 PID: 2074 Comm: cat Not tainted 5.12.0-rc4 #226
    Hardware name: hp server rx3600, BIOS 04.03 04/08/2008
    ip is at dereference_module_function_descriptor+0x41/0x100

Crash happens at dereference_module_function_descriptor() due to
use-after-free when dereferencing ".opd" section header.

All section headers are already freed after module is laoded successfully.

To keep symbolizer working the change stores ".opd" address and size after
module is relocated to a new place and before section headers are
discarded.

To make similar errors less obscure module_finalize() now zeroes out all
variables relevant to module loading only.
