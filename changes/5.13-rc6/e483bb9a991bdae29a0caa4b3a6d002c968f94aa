ACPI: custom_method: fix potential use-after-free issue

In cm_write(), buf is always freed when reaching the end of the
function.  If the requested count is less than table.length, the
allocated buffer will be freed but subsequent calls to cm_write() will
still try to access it.

Remove the unconditional kfree(buf) at the end of the function and
set the buf to NULL in the -EINVAL error path to match the rest of
function.
