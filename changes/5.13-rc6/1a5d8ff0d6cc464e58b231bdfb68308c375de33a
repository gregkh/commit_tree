arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: Remove fp control pins in prep for coachz

Removed the pinctrl and pin{mux,conf} for the control pins because:
1. The only need for them is for userspace control via flash_fp_mcu
2. cros-ec doesn't know what to do with them, and even if it did,
   it would interfere with flash_fp_mcu at the most inopportune times

Since we're not using hogs, we rely on AP firmware to set all the
control pins correctly.
