docs: reporting-issues.rst: reshuffle and improve TLDR

Make the TLDR a bit shorter while improving it at the same time by going
straight to the aspects readers are more interested it. The change makes
the process especially more straight-forward for people that hit a
regression in a stable or longterm kernel. Due to the changes the TLDR
now also matches the step by step guide better.
