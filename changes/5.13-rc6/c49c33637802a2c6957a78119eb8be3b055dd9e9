HID: support for initialization of some Thrustmaster wheels

Add support for proper initialization of some Thrustmaster wheels that
appear like a "Thrustmaster FFB Wheel" (044f:b65d) to the host. When the
device is connected a special usb request is sent, this request makes the
wheel disconnect and reappear to the host as the "real wheel".
For example: a T150 will re-appear as 044f:b677 and a T300 as 044f:b66e
