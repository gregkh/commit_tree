KVM: selftests: evmcs_test: Check that VMCS12 is alway properly synced to eVMCS after restore

Add a test for the regression, introduced by commit f2c7ef3ba955
("KVM: nSVM: cancel KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES on nested vmexit"). When
L2->L1 exit is forced immediately after restoring nested state,
KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES request is cleared and VMCS12 changes
(e.g. fresh RIP) are not reflected to eVMCS. The consequent nested
vCPU run gets broken.

Utilize NMI injection to do the job.
