ALSA: ctxfi: fix comment syntax in file headers

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
There are files in sound/pci/ctxfi which follow this syntax in their file
headers, i.e. start with '/**' like comments, which causes unexpected
warnings from kernel-doc.

E.g., running scripts/kernel-doc -none on sound/pci/ctxfi/ctresource.c
causes this warning:
"warning: wrong kernel-doc identifier on line:
 * Copyright (C) 2008, Creative Technology Ltd. All Rights Reserved."

Similarly for other files too.

Provide a simple fix by replacing the kernel-doc like comment syntax with
general format, i.e. "/*", to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
