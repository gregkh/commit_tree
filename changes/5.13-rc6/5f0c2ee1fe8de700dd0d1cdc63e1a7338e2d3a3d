bus: mhi: pci-generic: Fix hibernation

This patch fixes crash after resuming from hibernation. The issue
occurs when mhi stack is builtin and so part of the 'restore-kernel',
causing the device to be resumed from 'restored kernel' with a no
more valid context (memory mappings etc...) and leading to spurious
crashes.

This patch fixes the issue by implementing proper freeze/restore
callbacks.
