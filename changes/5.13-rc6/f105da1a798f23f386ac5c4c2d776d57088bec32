afs: Don't truncate iter during data fetch

Don't truncate the iterator to correspond to the actual data size when
fetching the data from the server - rather, pass the length we want to read
to rxrpc.

This will allow the clear-after-read code in future to simply clear the
remaining iterator capacity rather than having to reinitialise the
iterator.
