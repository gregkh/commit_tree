serial: stm32: add FIFO flush when port is closed

Transmission complete error is sent when ISR_TC is not set. If port closure
is requested despite data in TDR / TX FIFO has not been sent (because of
flow control), ISR_TC is not set and error message is sent on port closure
but also when a new port is opened.

Flush the data when port is closed, so the error isn't printed twice upon
next port opening.
