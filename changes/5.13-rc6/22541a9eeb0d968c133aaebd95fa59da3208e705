libbpf: Add BTF_KIND_FLOAT support

The logic follows that of BTF_KIND_INT most of the time. Sanitization
replaces BTF_KIND_FLOATs with equally-sized empty BTF_KIND_STRUCTs on
older kernels, for example, the following:

    [4] FLOAT 'float' size=4

becomes the following:

    [4] STRUCT '(anon)' size=4 vlen=0

With dwarves patch [1] and this patch, the older kernels, which were
failing with the floating-point-related errors, will now start working
correctly.
