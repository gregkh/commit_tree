dt-bindings: usb: mtu3: support wakeup for mt8183 and mt8192

These two HW of wakeup don't follow MediaTek internal IPM rule,
and both use a specific way, like as early revision of mt8173.

Due to the index 2 already used by many DTS, it's better to keep
it unchanged for backward compatibility, treat specific ones without
following IPM rule as revision 1.x, meanwhile reserve 3~99 for
later revision that following the IPM rule.
