usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix START_TRANSFER link state check

The START_TRANSFER command needs to be executed while in ON/U0 link
state (with an exception during register initialization). Don't use
dwc->link_state to check this since the driver only tracks the link
state when the link state change interrupt is enabled. Check the link
state from DSTS register instead.

Note that often the host already brings the device out of low power
before it sends/requests the next transfer. So, the user won't see any
issue when the device starts transfer then. This issue is more
noticeable in cases when the device delays starting transfer, which can
happen during delayed control status after the host put the device in
low power.
