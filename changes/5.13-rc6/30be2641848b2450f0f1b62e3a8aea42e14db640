ASoC: rt5670: Remove 'OUT Channel Switch' control

The "OUT Channel Switch" control is a left over from code copied from
thr rt5640 codec driver.

With the rt5640 codec driver the output volume controls have 2 pairs of
mute bits:
bit 7, 15: Mute Control for Spk/Headphone/Line Output Port
bit 6, 14: Mute Control for Spk/Headphone/Line Volume Channel

Bits 7 and 15 are normal mute bits on the rt5670/5672 which are
controlled by 2 dapm widgets:
	SND_SOC_DAPM_SWITCH("LOUT L Playback", SND_SOC_NOPM, 0, 0,
			    &lout_l_enable_control),
	SND_SOC_DAPM_SWITCH("LOUT R Playback", SND_SOC_NOPM, 0, 0,
			    &lout_r_enable_control),

But on the 5670/5672 bit 6 is always reserved, where as bit 14 is
"LOUT Differential Mode" on the 5670 and also reserved on the 5672.

So the "OUT Channel Switch" control which is controlling bits 6+14
of the "LINE Output Control" register is bogus -> remove it.

This should not cause any issues for userspace. AFAICT the rt567x codecs
are only used on x86/ACPI devices and the UCM profiles used there do not
use the "OUT Channel Switch" control.
