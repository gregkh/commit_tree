net: enetc: automatically select IERB module

Now that enetc supports flow control we have to make sure the settings in
the IERB are correct. Therefore, we actually depend on the enetc-ierb
module. Previously it was possible that this module was disabled while the
enetc was enabled. Fix it by automatically select the enetc-ierb module.
