ASoC: fsl: fsl_dma: remove unused variable

cppcheck warning:

sound/soc/fsl/fsl_dma.c:411:10: style: Variable 'channel' is assigned
a value that is never used. [unreadVariable]

 channel = substream->stream == SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK ? 0 : 1;
         ^

Removing this line shows the variable isn't needed any longer so
remove declaration as well.
