spi: stm32-qspi: fix pm_runtime usage_count counter

pm_runtime usage_count counter is not well managed.
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend callback drops the usage_counter but this
one has never been increased. Add pm_runtime_get_sync callback to bump up
the usage counter. It is also needed to use pm_runtime_force_suspend and
pm_runtime_force_resume APIs to handle properly the clock.
