KVM: x86/mmu: Drop trace_kvm_age_page() tracepoint

Remove x86's trace_kvm_age_page() tracepoint.  It's mostly redundant with
the common trace_kvm_age_hva() tracepoint, and if there is a need for the
extra details, e.g. gfn, referenced, etc... those details should be added
to the common tracepoint so that all architectures and MMUs benefit from
the info.
