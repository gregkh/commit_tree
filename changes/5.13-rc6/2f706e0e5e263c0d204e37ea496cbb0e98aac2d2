x86/kprobes: Fix to identify indirect jmp and others using range case

Fix can_boost() to identify indirect jmp and others using range case
correctly.

Since the condition in switch statement is opcode & 0xf0, it can not
evaluate to 0xff case. This should be under the 0xf0 case. However,
there is no reason to use the conbinations of the bit-masked condition
and lower bit checking.

Use range case to clean up the switch statement too.
