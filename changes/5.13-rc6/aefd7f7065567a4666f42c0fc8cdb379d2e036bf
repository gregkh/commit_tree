btrfs: promote debugging asserts to full-fledged checks in validate_super

Syzbot managed to trigger this assert while performing its fuzzing.
Turns out it's better to have those asserts turned into full-fledged
checks so that in case buggy btrfs images are mounted the users gets
an error and mounting is stopped. Alternatively with CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT
disabled such image would have been erroneously allowed to be mounted.
