ALSA: hda/realtek: the bass speaker can't output sound on Yoga 9i

The Lenovo Yoga 9i has bass speaker, but the bass speaker can't work,
that is because there is an i2s amplifier on that speaker, need to
run ideapad_s740_coef() to initialize the amplifier.

And also needs to apply ALC285_FIXUP_THINKPAD_HEADSET_JACK to rename
the speaker's mixer control name, otherwise the PA can't handle them.
