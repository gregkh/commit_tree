selftests/bpf: Restructure xsk selftests

Prior to this commit individual xsk tests were launched from the
shell script 'test_xsk.sh'. When adding a new test type, two new test
configurations had to be added to this file - one for each of the
supported XDP 'modes' (skb or drv). Should zero copy support be added to
the xsk selftest framework in the future, three new test configurations
would need to be added for each new test type. Each new test type also
typically requires new CLI arguments for the xdpxceiver program.

This commit aims to reduce the overhead of adding new tests, by launching
the test configurations from within the xdpxceiver program itself, using
simple loops. Every test is run every time the C program is executed. Many
of the CLI arguments can be removed as a result.
