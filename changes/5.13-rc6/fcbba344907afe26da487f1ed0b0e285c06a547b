tty: serial: samsung_tty: Add support for Apple UARTs

Apple SoCs are a distant descendant of Samsung designs and use yet
another variant of their UART style, with different interrupt handling.

In particular, this variant has the following differences with existing
ones:

* It includes a built-in interrupt controller with different registers,
  using only a single platform IRQ

* Internal interrupt sources are treated as edge-triggered, even though
  the IRQ output is level-triggered. This chiefly affects the TX IRQ
  path: the driver can no longer rely on the TX buffer empty IRQ
  immediately firing after TX is enabled, but instead must prime the
  FIFO with data directly.
