scsi: zfcp: Clean up sysfs code for SFP diagnostics

The error path from zfcp_adapter_enqueue() no longer attempts to remove the
diagnostics attributes if they haven't been created yet.

So remove the manual 'sysfs_established' guard for this case, and use
device_add_groups() to add all adapter-related sysfs attributes in one go.
