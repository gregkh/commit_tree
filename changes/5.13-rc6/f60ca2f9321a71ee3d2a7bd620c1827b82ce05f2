KVM: arm64: Always zero invalid PTEs

kvm_set_invalid_pte() currently only clears bit 0 from a PTE because
stage2_map_walk_table_post() needs to be able to follow the anchor. In
preparation for re-using bits 63-01 from invalid PTEs, make sure to zero
it entirely by ensuring to cache the anchor's child upfront.
