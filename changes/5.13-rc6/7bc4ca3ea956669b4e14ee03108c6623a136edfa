vm/test_vmalloc.sh: adapt for updated driver interface

A 'single_cpu_test' parameter is odd and it does not exist anymore.
Instead there was introduced a 'nr_threads' one.  If it is not set it
behaves as the former parameter.

That is why update a "stress mode" according to this change specifying
number of workers which are equal to number of CPUs.  Also update an
output of help message based on a new interface.
