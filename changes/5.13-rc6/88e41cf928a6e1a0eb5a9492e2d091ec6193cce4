io_uring: add multishot mode for IORING_OP_POLL_ADD

The default io_uring poll mode is one-shot, where once the event triggers,
the poll command is completed and won't trigger any further events. If
we're doing repeated polling on the same file or socket, then it can be
more efficient to do multishot, where we keep triggering whenever the
event becomes true.

This deviates from the usual norm of having one CQE per SQE submitted. Add
a CQE flag, IORING_CQE_F_MORE, which tells the application to expect
further completion events from the submitted SQE. Right now the only user
of this is POLL_ADD in multishot mode.

Since sqe->poll_events is using the space that we normally use for adding
flags to commands, use sqe->len for the flag space for POLL_ADD. Multishot
mode is selected by setting IORING_POLL_ADD_MULTI in sqe->len. An
application should expect more CQEs for the specificed SQE if the CQE is
flagged with IORING_CQE_F_MORE. In multishot mode, only cancelation or an
error will terminate the poll request, in which case the flag will be
cleared.
