clk: exynos7: Mark aclk_fsys1_200 as critical

This clock must be always enabled to allow access to any registers in
fsys1 CMU. Until proper solution based on runtime PM is applied
(similar to what was done for Exynos5433), mark that clock as critical
so it won't be disabled.

It was observed on Samsung Galaxy S6 device (based on Exynos7420), where
UFS module is probed before pmic used to power that device.
In this case defer probe was happening and that clock was disabled by
UFS driver, causing whole boot to hang on next CMU access.
