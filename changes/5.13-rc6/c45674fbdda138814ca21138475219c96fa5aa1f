fs: dlm: change allocation limits

While running tcpkill I experienced invalid header length values while
receiving to check that a node doesn't try to send a invalid dlm message
we also check on applications minimum allocation limit. Also use
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE as maximum allocation limit. The define
LOWCOMMS_MAX_TX_BUFFER_LEN is to calculate maximum buffer limits on
application layer, future midcomms layer will subtract their needs from
this define.
