x86, lto: Pass -stack-alignment only on LLD < 13.0.0

Since LLVM commit 3787ee4, the '-stack-alignment' flag has been dropped
[1], leading to the following error message when building a LTO kernel
with Clang-13 and LLD-13:

    ld.lld: error: -plugin-opt=-: ld.lld: Unknown command line argument
    '-stack-alignment=8'.  Try 'ld.lld --help'
    ld.lld: Did you mean '--stackrealign=8'?

It also appears that the '-code-model' flag is not necessary anymore
starting with LLVM-9 [2].

Drop '-code-model' and make '-stack-alignment' conditional on LLD < 13.0.0.

These flags were necessary because these flags were not encoded in the
IR properly, so the link would restart optimizations without them. Now
there are properly encoded in the IR, and these flags exposing
implementation details are no longer necessary.
