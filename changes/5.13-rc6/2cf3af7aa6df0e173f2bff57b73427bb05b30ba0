scripts/recordmcount.pl: Make indent spacing consistent

Emacs by default will have perl files have 4 space indents, where 8 spaces
are represented with a single tab. There are some places in
recordmcount.pl that has 8 spaces where a tab should be used. Replace them
to make the file consistent.

No functional changes.
