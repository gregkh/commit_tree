objtool: Rework the elf_rebuild_reloc_section() logic

Instead of manually calling elf_rebuild_reloc_section() on sections
we've called elf_add_reloc() on, have elf_write() DTRT.

This makes it easier to add random relocations in places without
carefully tracking when we're done and need to flush what section.
