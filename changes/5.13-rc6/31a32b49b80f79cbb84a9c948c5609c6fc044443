arm64: Cope with CPUs stuck in VHE mode

It seems that the CPUs part of the SoC known as Apple M1 have the
terrible habit of being stuck with HCR_EL2.E2H==1, in violation
of the architecture.

Try and work around this deplorable state of affairs by detecting
the stuck bit early and short-circuit the nVHE dance. Additional
filtering code ensures that attempts at switching to nVHE from
the command-line are also ignored.

It is still unknown whether there are many more such nuggets
to be found...
