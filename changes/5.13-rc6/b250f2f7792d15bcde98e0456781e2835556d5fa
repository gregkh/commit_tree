x86/sev-es: Don't return NULL from sev_es_get_ghcb()

sev_es_get_ghcb() is called from several places but only one of them
checks the return value. The reaction to returning NULL is always the
same: calling panic() and kill the machine.

Instead of adding checks to all call sites, move the panic() into the
function itself so that it will no longer return NULL.
