scsi: message: mptlan: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having a
dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use "flexible array members"[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of a flexible-array member in struct
_SGE_TRANSACTION32 instead of one-element array.

Also, this helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by
fixing the following warning:

  CC [M]  drivers/message/fusion/mptlan.o
drivers/message/fusion/mptlan.c: In function ‘mpt_lan_sdu_send’:
drivers/message/fusion/mptlan.c:759:28: warning: array subscript 1 is above array bounds of ‘U32[1]’ {aka ‘unsigned int[1]’} [-Warray-bounds]
  759 |  pTrans->TransactionDetails[1] = cpu_to_le32((mac[2] << 24) |
      |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
