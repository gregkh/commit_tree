nvmet: seset ns->file when open fails

Reset the ns->file value to NULL also in the error case in
nvmet_file_ns_enable().

The ns->file variable points either to file object or contains the
error code after the filp_open() call. This can lead to following
problem:

When the user first setups an invalid file backend and tries to enable
the ns, it will fail. Then the user switches over to a bdev backend
and enables successfully the ns. The first received I/O will crash the
system because the IO backend is chosen based on the ns->file value:

static u16 nvmet_parse_io_cmd(struct nvmet_req *req)
{
	[...]

	if (req->ns->file)
		return nvmet_file_parse_io_cmd(req);

	return nvmet_bdev_parse_io_cmd(req);
}
