perf record: Move probing cgroup sampling support

I found that checking cgroup sampling support using the missing features
doesn't work on old kernels.  Because it added both attr.cgroup bit and
PERF_SAMPLE_CGROUP bit, it needs to check whichever comes first (usually
the actual event, not dummy).

But it only checks the attr.cgroup bit which is set only in the dummy
event so cannot detect failtures due the sample bits.  Also we don't
ignore the missing feature and retry, it'd be better checking it with
the API probing logic.

Committer notes:

Extracted the minimal part to check using the new cgroup API probe
routine, the part that removes the cgroup member can be left for further
discussion.
