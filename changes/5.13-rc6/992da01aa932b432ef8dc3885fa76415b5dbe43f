io_uring: change registration/upd/rsrc tagging ABI

There are ABI moments about recently added rsrc registration/update and
tagging that might become a nuisance in the future. First,
IORING_REGISTER_RSRC[_UPD] hide different types of resources under it,
so breaks fine control over them by restrictions. It works for now, but
once those are wanted under restrictions it would require a rework.

It was also inconvenient trying to fit a new resource not supporting
all the features (e.g. dynamic update) into the interface, so better
to return to IORING_REGISTER_* top level dispatching.

Second, register/update were considered to accept a type of resource,
however that's not a good idea because there might be several ways of
registration of a single resource type, e.g. we may want to add
non-contig buffers or anything more exquisite as dma mapped memory.
So, remove IORING_RSRC_[FILE,BUFFER] out of the ABI, and place them
internally for now to limit changes.
