selftests/bpf: Test ringbuf mmap read-only and read-write restrictions

Extend ringbuf selftest to validate read/write and read-only restrictions on
memory mapping consumer/producer/data pages. Ensure no "escalations" from
PROT_READ to PROT_WRITE/PROT_EXEC is allowed. And test that mremap() fails to
expand mmap()'ed area.
