usb: typec: tcpm: Properly handle Alert and Status Messages

When receiving Alert Message, if it is not unexpected but is
unsupported for some reason, the port should return Not_Supported
Message response.

Also, according to PD3.0 Spec 6.5.2.1.4 Event Flags Field, the
OTP/OVP/OCP flags in the Event Flags field in Status Message no longer
require Get_PPS_Status Message to clear them. Thus remove it when
receiving Status Message with those flags being set.

In addition, add the missing AMS operations for Status Message.

Fixes: 64f7c494a3c0 ("typec: tcpm: Add support for sink PPS related messages")
Fixes: 0908c5aca31e ("usb: typec: tcpm: AMS and Collision Avoidance")
