KVM: arm64: Elevate hypervisor mappings creation at EL2

Previous commits have introduced infrastructure to enable the EL2 code
to manage its own stage 1 mappings. However, this was preliminary work,
and none of it is currently in use.

Put all of this together by elevating the mapping creation at EL2 when
memory protection is enabled. In this case, the host kernel running
at EL1 still creates _temporary_ EL2 mappings, only used while
initializing the hypervisor, but frees them right after.

As such, all calls to create_hyp_mappings() after kvm init has finished
turn into hypercalls, as the host now has no 'legal' way to modify the
hypevisor page tables directly.
