ALSA: hda/realtek: headphone and mic don't work on an Acer laptop

There are 2 issues on this machine, the 1st one is mic's plug/unplug
can't be detected, that is because the mic is set to manual detecting
mode, need to apply ALC255_FIXUP_XIAOMI_HEADSET_MIC to set it to auto
detecting mode. The other one is headphone's plug/unplug can't be
detected by pulseaudio, that is because the pulseaudio will use
ucm2/sof-hda-dsp on this machine, and the ucm2 only handle
'Headphone Jack', but on this machine the headphone's pincfg sets the
location to Front, then the alsa mixer name is "Front Headphone Jack"
instead of "Headphone Jack", so override the pincfg to change location
to Left.
