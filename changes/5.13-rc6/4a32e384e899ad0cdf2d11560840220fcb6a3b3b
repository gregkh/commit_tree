software node: Imply kobj_to_swnode() to be no-op

Since we don't use structure field layout randomization
the manual shuffling can affect some macros, in particular
kobj_to_swnode(), which becomes a no-op when kobj member
is the first one in the struct swnode.

Bloat-o-meter statistics for swnode.o:

  add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 2/10 up/down: 9/-100 (-91)
  Total: Before=7217, After=7126, chg -1.26%
