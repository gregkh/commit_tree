ionic: add hw timestamp structs to interface

The interface for hardware timestamping includes a new FW
request, device identity fields, Tx and Rx queue feature bits, a
new Rx filter type, the beginnings of Rx packet classifications,
and hardware timestamp registers.

If the IONIC_ETH_HW_TIMESTAMP bit is shown in the
ionic_lif_config features bit string, then we have support
for the hw clock registers.  If the IONIC_RXQ_F_HWSTAMP and
IONIC_TXQ_F_HWSTAMP features are shown in the ionic_q_identity
features, then the queues can support HW timestamps on packets.
