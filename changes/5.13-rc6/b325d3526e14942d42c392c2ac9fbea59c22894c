hwmon: (tps23861) set current shunt value

TPS23861 has a configuration bit for setting of the
current shunt value used on the board.
Its bit 0 of the General Mask 1 register.

According to the datasheet bit values are:
0 for 255 mOhm (Default)
1 for 250 mOhm

So, configure the bit before registering the hwmon
device according to the value passed in the DTS or
default one if none is passed.

This caused potentially reading slightly skewed values
due to max current value being 1.02A when 250mOhm shunt
is used instead of 1.0A when 255mOhm is used.
