riscv: Add ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE

FORTIFY_SOURCE could detect various overflows at compile and run time.
ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE means that the architecture can be built and
run with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE. Select it in RISCV.

See more about this feature from commit 6974f0c4555e
("include/linux/string.h: add the option of fortified string.h functions").
