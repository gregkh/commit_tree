selftests/resctrl: Don't hard code value of "no_of_bits" variable

Cache related tests (like CAT and CMT) depend on a variable called
no_of_bits to run. no_of_bits defines the number of contiguous bits
that should be set in the CBM mask and a user can pass a value for
no_of_bits using -n command line argument. If a user hasn't passed any
value, it defaults to 5 (randomly chosen value).

Hard coding no_of_bits to 5 will make the cache tests fail to run on
systems that support maximum cbm mask that is less than or equal to 5 bits.
Hence, don't hard code no_of_bits value.

If a user passes a value for "no_of_bits" using -n option, use it.
Otherwise, no_of_bits is equal to half of the maximum number of bits in
the cbm mask.

Please note that CMT test is still hard coded to 5 bits. It will change in
subsequent patches that change CMT test.
