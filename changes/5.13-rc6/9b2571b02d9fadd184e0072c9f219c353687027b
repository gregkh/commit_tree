iio:Documentation:ABI Add missing elements as used by the adi,ad7150

Main additions are around thresh_adaptive.  This has been supported
by the core of IIO for a long time, but no driver that uses it has
previously graduated from staging, hence we are missing Docs.

Otherwise, just new entries in existing lists.
