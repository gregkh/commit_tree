selftests: bpf: Don't run sk_lookup in verifier tests

sk_lookup doesn't allow setting data_in for bpf_prog_run. This doesn't
play well with the verifier tests, since they always set a 64 byte
input buffer. Allow not running verifier tests by setting
bpf_test.runs to a negative value and don't run the ctx access case
for sk_lookup. We have dedicated ctx access tests so skipping here
doesn't reduce coverage.
