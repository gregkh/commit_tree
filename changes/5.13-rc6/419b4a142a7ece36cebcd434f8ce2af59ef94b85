brcmfmac: properly check for bus register errors

The brcmfmac driver ignores any errors on initialization with the
different busses by deferring the initialization to a workqueue and
ignoring all possible errors that might happen.  Fix up all of this by
only allowing the module to load if all bus registering worked properly.
