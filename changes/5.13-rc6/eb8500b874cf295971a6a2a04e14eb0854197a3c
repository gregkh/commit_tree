thermal/drivers/intel: Initialize RW trip to THERMAL_TEMP_INVALID

After commit 81ad4276b505 ("Thermal: Ignore invalid trip points") all
user_space governor notifications via RW trip point is broken in intel
thermal drivers. This commits marks trip_points with value of 0 during
call to thermal_zone_device_register() as invalid. RW trip points can be
0 as user space will set the correct trip temperature later.

During driver init, x86_package_temp and all int340x drivers sets RW trip
temperature as 0. This results in all these trips marked as invalid by
the thermal core.

To fix this initialize RW trips to THERMAL_TEMP_INVALID instead of 0.
