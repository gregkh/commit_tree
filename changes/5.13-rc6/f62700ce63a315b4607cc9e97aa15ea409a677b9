tools: Allow proper CC/CXX/... override with LLVM=1 in Makefile.include

selftests/bpf/Makefile includes tools/scripts/Makefile.include.
With the following command
  make -j60 LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1  <=== compile kernel
  make -j60 -C tools/testing/selftests/bpf LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 V=1
some files are still compiled with gcc. This patch
fixed the case if CC/AR/LD/CXX/STRIP is allowed to be
overridden, it will be written to clang/llvm-ar/..., instead of
gcc binaries. The definition of CC_NO_CLANG is also relocated
to the place after the above CC is defined.
