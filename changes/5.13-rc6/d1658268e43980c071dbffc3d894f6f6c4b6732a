usb: pci-quirks: disable D3cold on xhci suspend for s2idle on AMD Renoir

The XHCI controller is required to enter D3hot rather than D3cold for AMD
s2idle on this hardware generation.

Otherwise, the 'Controller Not Ready' (CNR) bit is not being cleared by
host in resume and eventually this results in xhci resume failures during
the s2idle wakeup.
