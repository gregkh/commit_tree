sit: proper dev_{hold|put} in ndo_[un]init methods

After adopting CONFIG_PCPU_DEV_REFCNT=n option, syzbot was able to trigger
a warning [1]

Issue here is that:

- all dev_put() should be paired with a corresponding prior dev_hold().

- A driver doing a dev_put() in its ndo_uninit() MUST also
  do a dev_hold() in its ndo_init(), only when ndo_init()
  is returning 0.

Otherwise, register_netdevice() would call ndo_uninit()
in its error path and release a refcount too soon.
