perf: Fix data race between pin_count increment/decrement

KCSAN reports a data race between increment and decrement of pin_count:

  write to 0xffff888237c2d4e0 of 4 bytes by task 15740 on cpu 1:
   find_get_context		kernel/events/core.c:4617
   __do_sys_perf_event_open	kernel/events/core.c:12097 [inline]
   __se_sys_perf_event_open	kernel/events/core.c:11933
   ...
  read to 0xffff888237c2d4e0 of 4 bytes by task 15743 on cpu 0:
   perf_unpin_context		kernel/events/core.c:1525 [inline]
   __do_sys_perf_event_open	kernel/events/core.c:12328 [inline]
   __se_sys_perf_event_open	kernel/events/core.c:11933
   ...

Because neither read-modify-write here is atomic, this can lead to one
of the operations being lost, resulting in an inconsistent pin_count.
Fix it by adding the missing locking in the CPU-event case.
