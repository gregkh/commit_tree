perf stat: Introduce config stat.bpf-counter-events

Currently, to use BPF to aggregate perf event counters, the user uses
--bpf-counters option. Enable "use bpf by default" events with a config
option, stat.bpf-counter-events. Events with name in the option will use
BPF.

This also enables mixed BPF event and regular event in the same sesssion.
For example:

   perf config stat.bpf-counter-events=instructions
   perf stat -e instructions,cs

The second command will use BPF for "instructions" but not "cs".
