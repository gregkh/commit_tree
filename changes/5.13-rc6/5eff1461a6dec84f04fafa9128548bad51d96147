net: macb: ensure the device is available before accessing GEMGXL control registers

If runtime power menagement is enabled, the gigabit ethernet PLL would
be disabled after macb_probe(). During this period of time, the system
would hang up if we try to access GEMGXL control registers.

We can't put runtime_pm_get/runtime_pm_put/ there due to the issue of
sleep inside atomic section (7fa2955ff70ce453 ("sh_eth: Fix sleeping
function called from invalid context"). Add netif_running checking to
ensure the device is available before accessing GEMGXL device.

Changed in v2:
 - Use netif_running instead of its own flag
