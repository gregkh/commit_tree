scsi: ibmvfc: Fix invalid state machine BUG_ON()

This fixes an issue hitting the BUG_ON() in ibmvfc_do_work(). When going
through a host action of IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_RESET, we change the action to
IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_TGT_DEL, then drop the host lock, and reset the CRQ,
which changes the host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ. If, prior to setting the
host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ, ibmvfc_init_host() is called, it can then end
up changing the host action to IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_INIT.  If we then change
the host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ, we will then hit the BUG_ON().

Make a couple of changes to avoid this. Leave the host action to be
IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_RESET or IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_REENABLE until after we drop
the host lock and reset or reenable the CRQ. Also harden the host state
machine to ensure we cannot leave the reset / reenable state until we've
finished processing the reset or reenable.
