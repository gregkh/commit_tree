arm64: mte: make the per-task SCTLR_EL1 field usable elsewhere

In an upcoming change we are going to introduce per-task SCTLR_EL1
bits for PAC. Move the existing per-task SCTLR_EL1 field out of the
MTE-specific code so that we will be able to use it from both the
PAC and MTE code paths and make the task switching code more efficient.
