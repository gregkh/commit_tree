libbpf: Support subprog address relocation

A new relocation RELO_SUBPROG_ADDR is added to capture
subprog addresses loaded with ld_imm64 insns. Such ld_imm64
insns are marked with BPF_PSEUDO_FUNC and will be passed to
kernel. For bpf_for_each_map_elem() case, kernel will
check that the to-be-used subprog address must be a static
function and replace it with proper actual jited func address.
