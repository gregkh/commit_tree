firmware: qcom_scm: Workaround lack of "is available" call on SC7180

Some SC7180 firmwares don't implement the QCOM_SCM_INFO_IS_CALL_AVAIL
API, so we can't probe the calling convention. We detect the legacy
calling convention on these firmwares, because the availability call
always fails and legacy is the fallback. This leads to problems where
the rmtfs driver fails to probe, because it tries to assign memory with
a bad calling convention, which then leads to modem failing to load and
all networking, even wifi, to fail. Ouch!

Let's force the calling convention to be what it always is on this SoC,
i.e. arm64. Of course, the calling convention is not the same thing as
implementing the QCOM_SCM_INFO_IS_CALL_AVAIL API. The absence of the "is
this call available" API from the firmware means that any call to
__qcom_scm_is_call_available() fails. This is OK for now though because
none of the calls that are checked for existence are implemented on
firmware running on sc7180. If such a call needs to be checked for
existence in the future, we presume that firmware will implement this
API and then things will "just work".
