NFSv4: Fix deadlock between nfs4_evict_inode() and nfs4_opendata_get_inode()

If the inode is being evicted, but has to return a delegation first,
then it can cause a deadlock in the corner case where the server reboots
before the delegreturn completes, but while the call to iget5_locked() in
nfs4_opendata_get_inode() is waiting for the inode free to complete.
Since the open call still holds a session slot, the reboot recovery
cannot proceed.

In order to break the logjam, we can turn the delegation return into a
privileged operation for the case where we're evicting the inode. We
know that in that case, there can be no other state recovery operation
that conflicts.
