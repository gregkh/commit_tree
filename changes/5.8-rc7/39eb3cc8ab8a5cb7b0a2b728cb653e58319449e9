pinctrl: sunxi: handle probe defferal

When checking the logs on my sun8i-a33-olinuxino I saw:
sun8i-a23-r-pinctrl 1f02c00.pinctrl: Reset controller missing
but this driver was working after.
This message is just here because the reset controller was still not probed.
So don't say anything if the return code say to wait.
