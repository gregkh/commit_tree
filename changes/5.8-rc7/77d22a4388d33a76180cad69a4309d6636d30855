Documentation/CodingStyle: Fix duplicate "are" typo

The improved paragraph about line lengths contains a sentence with a
duplicate word: there is one "are" at the end of a line, followed by a
second one at the beginning of the next line.

Drop the first one, as that one is part of the longest line.
