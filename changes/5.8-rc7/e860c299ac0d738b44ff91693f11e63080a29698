dma-remap: separate DMA atomic pools from direct remap code

DMA atomic pools will be needed beyond only CONFIG_DMA_DIRECT_REMAP so
separate them out into their own file.

This also adds a new Kconfig option that can be subsequently used for
options, such as CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT, that will utilize the coherent
pools but do not have a dependency on direct remapping.

For this patch alone, there is no functional change introduced.
