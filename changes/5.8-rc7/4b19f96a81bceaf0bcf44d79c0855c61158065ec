powerpc/32s: Don't warn when mapping RO data ROX.

Mapping RO data as ROX is not an issue since that data
cannot be modified to introduce an exploit.

PPC64 accepts to have RO data mapped ROX, as a trade off
between kernel size and strictness of protection.

On PPC32, kernel size is even more critical as amount of
memory is usually small.

Depending on the number of available IBATs, the last IBATs
might overflow the end of text. Only warn if it crosses
the end of RO data.
