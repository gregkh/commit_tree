firmware: smccc: Add HAVE_ARM_SMCCC_DISCOVERY to identify SMCCC v1.1 and above

SMCCC v1.0 lacked discoverability of version and features. To accelerate
adoption of few mitigations and protect systems more rapidly from various
vulnerability, PSCI v1.0 was updated to add SMCCC discovery mechanism
though the PSCI firmware implementation of PSCI_FEATURES(SMCCC_VERSION)
which returns success on firmware compliant to SMCCC v1.1 and above.

This inturn makes SMCCC v1.1 and above dependent on ARM_PSCI_FW for
backward compatibility. Let us introduce a new hidden config for the
same to build more features on top of SMCCC v1.1 and above.

While at it, also sort alphabetically the psci entry.
