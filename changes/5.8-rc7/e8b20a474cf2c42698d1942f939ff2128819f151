fuse: ignore 'data' argument of mount(..., MS_REMOUNT)

The command

  mount -o remount -o unknownoption /mnt/fuse

succeeds on kernel versions prior to v5.4 and fails on kernel version at or
after.  This is because fuse_parse_param() rejects any unrecognised options
in case of FS_CONTEXT_FOR_RECONFIGURE, just as for FS_CONTEXT_FOR_MOUNT.

This causes a regression in case the fuse filesystem is in fstab, since
remount sends all options found there to the kernel; even ones that are
meant for the initial mount and are consumed by the userspace fuse server.

Fix this by ignoring mount options, just as fuse_remount_fs() did prior to
the conversion to the new API.
