selftests/bpf: Copy runqslower to OUTPUT directory

$(OUTPUT)/runqslower makefile target doesn't actually create runqslower
binary in the $(OUTPUT) directory. As lib.mk expects all
TEST_GEN_PROGS_EXTENDED (which runqslower is a part of) to be present in
the OUTPUT directory, this results in an error when running e.g. `make
install`:

rsync: link_stat "tools/testing/selftests/bpf/runqslower" failed: No
       such file or directory (2)

Copy the binary into the OUTPUT directory after building it to fix the
error.
