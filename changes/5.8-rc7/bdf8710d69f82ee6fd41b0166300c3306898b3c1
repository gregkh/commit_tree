block: move dma_pad handling from blk_rq_map_sg into the callers

There are only two callers of blk_rq_map_sg/__blk_rq_map_sg that set
the dma_pad value in the queue.  Move the handling into those callers
instead of burdening the common code, and move the ->extra_len field
from struct request to struct scsi_cmnd.
