irqchip/gic-v3: Fix missing "__init" for gic_smp_init()

With an SMP configuration, gic_smp_init() calls set_smp_cross_call().
set_smp_cross_call() is marked with "__init".
So gic_smp_init() should also be marked with "__init".
gic_smp_init() is only called from gic_init_bases().
gic_init_bases() is also marked with "__init";
So marking gic_smp_init() with "__init" is fine.
