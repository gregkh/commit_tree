arm64: compat: Allow 32-bit vdso and sigpage to co-exist

In preparation for removing the signal trampoline from the compat vDSO,
allow the sigpage and the compat vDSO to co-exist.

For the moment the vDSO signal trampoline will still be used when built.
Subsequent patches will move to the sigpage consistently.
