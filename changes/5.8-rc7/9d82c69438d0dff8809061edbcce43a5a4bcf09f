mm: memcontrol: convert anon and file-thp to new mem_cgroup_charge() API

With the page->mapping requirement gone from memcg, we can charge anon and
file-thp pages in one single step, right after they're allocated.

This removes two out of three API calls - especially the tricky commit
step that needed to happen at just the right time between when the page is
"set up" and when it's "published" - somewhat vague and fluid concepts
that varied by page type.  All we need is a freshly allocated page and a
memcg context to charge.

v2: prevent double charges on pre-allocated hugepages in khugepaged
