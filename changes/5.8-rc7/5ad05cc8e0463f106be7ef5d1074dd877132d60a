vfs: Remove duplicated d_mountpoint check in __is_local_mountpoint

This function acts as an out-of-line helper for is_local_mountpoint
is only called after the latter verifies the dentry is not a mountpoint.
There's no semantic changes and the resulting object code is smaller:

add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/1 up/down: 0/-26 (-26)
