dt-bindings: thermal: Add yaml bindings for thermal zones

As part of moving the thermal bindings to YAML, split it up into 3
bindings: thermal sensors, cooling devices and thermal zones.

The thermal-zone binding is a software abstraction to capture the
properties of each zone - how often they should be checked, the
temperature thresholds (trips) at which mitigation actions need to be
taken and the level of mitigation needed at those thresholds.
