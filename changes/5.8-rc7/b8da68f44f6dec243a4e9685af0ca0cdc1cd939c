platform/x86: intel_pmc_ipc: Move PCI IDs to intel_scu_pcidrv.c

The PCI probe driver in intel_pmc_ipc.c is a duplicate of what we
already have in intel_scu_pcidrv.c with the exception that the later also
creates SCU specific devices. Move the PCI IDs from the intel_pmc_ipc.c
to intel_scu.c and use driver_data to detect whether SCU devices need to
be created or not.

Also update Kconfig entry to mention all platforms supported by the
Intel SCU PCI driver and change dependency from X86_INTEL_MID to PCI
which is more generic.
