powerpc: Move idle_loop_prolog()/epilog() functions to header file

Currently prior to entering an idle state on a Linux Guest, the
pseries cpuidle driver implement an idle_loop_prolog() and
idle_loop_epilog() functions which ensure that idle_purr is correctly
computed, and the hypervisor is informed that the CPU cycles have been
donated.

These prolog and epilog functions are also required in the default
idle call, i.e pseries_lpar_idle(). Hence move these accessor
functions to a common header file and call them from
pseries_lpar_idle(). Since the existing header files such as
asm/processor.h have enough clutter, create a new header file
asm/idle.h. Finally rename idle_loop_prolog() and idle_loop_epilog()
to pseries_idle_prolog() and pseries_idle_epilog() as they are only
relavent for on pseries guests.
