Revert "drm/dp_mst: Remove single tx msg restriction."

This reverts commit 6bb0942e8f46863a745489cce27efe5be2a3885e.

Unfortunately it would appear that the rumors we've heard of sideband
message interleaving not being very well supported are true. On the
Lenovo ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 dock that I have, interleaved messages
appear to just get dropped:

  [drm:drm_dp_mst_wait_tx_reply [drm_kms_helper]] timedout msg send
  00000000571ddfd0 2 1
  [dp_mst] txmsg cur_offset=2 cur_len=2 seqno=1 state=SENT path_msg=1 dst=00
  [dp_mst] 	type=ENUM_PATH_RESOURCES contents:
  [dp_mst] 		port=2

DP descriptor for this hub:
  OUI 90-cc-24 dev-ID SYNA3  HW-rev 1.0 SW-rev 3.12 quirks 0x0008

It would seem like as well that this is a somewhat well known issue in
the field. From section 5.4.2 of the DisplayPort 2.0 specification:

  There are MST Sink/Branch devices in the field that do not handle
  interleaved message transactions.

  To facilitate message transaction handling by downstream devices, an
  MST Source device shall generate message transactions in an atomic
  manner (i.e., the MST Source device shall not concurrently interleave
  multiple message transactions). Therefore, an MST Source device shall
  clear the Message_Sequence_No value in the Sideband_MSG_Header to 0.

  MST Source devices that support field policy updates by way of
  software should update the policy to forego the generation of
  interleaved message transactions.

This is a bit disappointing, as features like HDCP require that we send
a sideband request every ~2 seconds for each active stream. However,
there isn't really anything in the specification that allows us to
accurately probe for interleaved messages.

If it ends up being that we -really- need this in the future, we might
be able to whitelist hubs where interleaving is known to work-or maybe
try some sort of heuristics. But for now, let's just play it safe and
not use it.
