drm/amd/display: Internal refactoring to abstract color caps

[Why&How]
modules/color calculates various colour operations which are translated
to abstracted HW. DCE 5-12 had almost no important changes, but
starting with DCN1, every new generation comes with fairly major
differences in color pipeline.
We would hack it with some DCN checks, but a better approach is to
abstract color pipe capabilities so modules/DM can decide mapping to
HW block based on logical capabilities,
