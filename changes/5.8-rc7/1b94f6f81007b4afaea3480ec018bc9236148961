KVM: Remove redundant argument to kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run

In earlier versions of kvm, 'kvm_run' was an independent structure
and was not included in the vcpu structure. At present, 'kvm_run'
is already included in the vcpu structure, so the parameter
'kvm_run' is redundant.

This patch simplifies the function definition, removes the extra
'kvm_run' parameter, and extracts it from the 'kvm_vcpu' structure
if necessary.
