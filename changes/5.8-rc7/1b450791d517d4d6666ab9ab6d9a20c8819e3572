ASoC: Intel: Multiple I/O PCM format support for pipe

For pipes supporting multiple input/output formats, kcontrol is
created and selection of pipe input and output configuration
is done based on control set.

If more than one configuration is supported, then this patch
allows user to select configuration of choice
using amixer settings.
