binfmt: Move install_exec_creds after setup_new_exec to match binfmt_elf

In 2016 Linus moved install_exec_creds immediately after
setup_new_exec, in binfmt_elf as a cleanup and as part of closing a
potential information leak.

Perform the same cleanup for the other binary formats.

Different binary formats doing the same things the same way makes exec
easier to reason about and easier to maintain.
