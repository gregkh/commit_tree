drm/amd/display: Check for null fclk voltage when parsing clock table

[WHY]
In cases where a clock table is malformed such that fclk entries have
frequencies but not voltages listed, we don't catch the error and set
clocks to 0 instead of using hardcoded values as we should.

[HOW]
Add check for clock tables fclk entry's voltage as well
