sched: Remove checks against SD_LOAD_BALANCE

The SD_LOAD_BALANCE flag is set unconditionally for all domains in
sd_init(). By making the sched_domain->flags syctl interface read-only, we
have removed the last piece of code that could clear that flag - as such,
it will now be always present. Rather than to keep carrying it along, we
can work towards getting rid of it entirely.

cpusets don't need it because they can make CPUs be attached to the NULL
domain (e.g. cpuset with sched_load_balance=0), or to a partitioned
root_domain, i.e. a sched_domain hierarchy that doesn't span the entire
system (e.g. root cpuset with sched_load_balance=0 and sibling cpusets with
sched_load_balance=1).

isolcpus apply the same "trick": isolated CPUs are explicitly taken out of
the sched_domain rebuild (using housekeeping_cpumask()), so they get the
NULL domain treatment as well.

Remove the checks against SD_LOAD_BALANCE.
