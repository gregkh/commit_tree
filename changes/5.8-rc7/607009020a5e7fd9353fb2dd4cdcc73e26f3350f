fscrypt: remove unnecessary extern keywords

Remove the unnecessary 'extern' keywords from function declarations.
This makes it so that we don't have a mix of both styles, so it won't be
ambiguous what to use in new fscrypt patches.  This also makes the code
shorter and matches the 'checkpatch --strict' expectation.
