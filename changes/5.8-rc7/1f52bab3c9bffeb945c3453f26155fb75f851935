dt-bindings: display: dw_mipi_dsi.txt: convert to yaml

This converts the Synopsis MIPI DSI binding documentation to yaml and
should be quite straightforward. I've added a missing ref clk and also
added Philippe as maintainer b/c he's the original txt author following
the algorithm provided in Message-ID 20200420175909.GA5810@ravnborg.org.
