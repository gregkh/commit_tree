arm64: cpufeature: Relax AArch32 system checks if EL1 is 64-bit only

If AArch32 is not supported at EL1, the AArch32 feature register fields
no longer advertise support for some system features:

  * ISAR4.SMC
  * PFR1.{Virt_frac, Sec_frac, Virtualization, Security, ProgMod}

In which case, we don't need to emit "SANITY CHECK" failures for all of
them.

Add logic to relax the strictness of individual feature register fields
at runtime and use this for the fields above if 32-bit EL1 is not
supported.
