xfs: combine xfs_trans_ail_[remove|delete]()

Now that the functions and callers of
xfs_trans_ail_[remove|delete]() have been fixed up appropriately,
the only difference between the two is the shutdown behavior. There
are only a few callers of the _remove() variant, so make the
shutdown conditional on the parameter and combine the two functions.
