drm/i915: Peel dma-fence-chains for await

To allow faster engine to engine synchronization, peel the layer of
dma-fence-chain to expose potential i915 fences so that the
i915_request code can emit HW semaphore wait/signal operations in the
ring which is faster than waking up the host to submit unblocked
workloads after interrupt notification.

This is similar to the peeling we do for e.g. dma_fence_array.
