cfg80211: add KHz variants of frame RX API

Drivers may wish to report the RX frequency in units of
KHz. Provide cfg80211_rx_mgmt_khz() and wrap it with
cfg80211_rx_mgmt() so exisiting drivers which can't report
KHz anyway don't need to change. Add a similar wrapper for
cfg80211_report_obss_beacon() so the frequency units stay
somewhat consistent.

This doesn't actually change the nl80211 API yet.
