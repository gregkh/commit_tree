media: imx: imx7-mipi-csis: Never set MIPI_CSIS_ISPCFG_ALIGN_32BIT

The MIPI_CSIS_ISPCFG_ALIGN_32BIT bit enables output of 32-bit data. The
driver sets it based on the select format, but no format uses a 32-bit
bus width, so the bit is never set in practice. This isn't likely to
change any time soon, as the CSI IP core connected at the output of the
CSIS doesn't support 32-bit data width. Hardcode the bit to 0.
