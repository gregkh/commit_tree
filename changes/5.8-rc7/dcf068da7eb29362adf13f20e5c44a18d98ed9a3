KVM: VMX: Introduce generic fastpath handler

Introduce generic fastpath handler to handle MSR fastpath, VMX-preemption
timer fastpath etc; move it after vmx_complete_interrupts() in order to
catch events delivered to the guest, and abort the fast path in later
patches.  While at it, move the kvm_exit tracepoint so that it is printed
for fastpath vmexits as well.

There is no observed performance effect for the IPI fastpath after this patch.
