selftests/powerpc: Fix build failure in ebb tests

We use OUTPUT directory as TMPOUT for checking no-pie option.

Since commit f2f02ebd8f38 ("kbuild: improve cc-option to clean up all
temporary files") when building powerpc/ from selftests directory, the
OUTPUT directory points to powerpc/pmu/ebb/ and gets removed when
checking for -no-pie option in try-run routine, subsequently build
fails with the following:

  $ make -C powerpc
  ...
  TARGET=ebb; BUILD_TARGET=$OUTPUT/$TARGET; mkdir -p $BUILD_TARGET; make OUTPUT=$BUILD_TARGET -k -C $TARGET all
  make[2]: Entering directory '/home/linux-master/tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/pmu/ebb'
  make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'Makefile'.
  make[2]: Failed to remake makefile 'Makefile'.
  make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'ebb.c', needed by '/home/linux-master/tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/pmu/ebb/reg_access_test'.
  make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'ebb_handler.S', needed by '/home/linux-master/tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/pmu/ebb/reg_access_test'.
  make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'trace.c', needed by '/home/linux-master/tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/pmu/ebb/reg_access_test'.
  make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'busy_loop.S', needed by '/home/linux-master/tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/pmu/ebb/reg_access_test'.
  make[2]: Target 'all' not remade because of errors.

Fix this by adding a suffix to the OUTPUT directory so that the
failure is avoided.
