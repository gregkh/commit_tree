EDAC/i10nm: Update driver to support different bus number config register offsets

The i10nm_edac driver failed to load on Ice Lake and Tremont/Jacobsville
servers if their CPU stepping >= 4 and failed on Ice Lake-D servers from
stepping 0. The root cause was that for Ice Lake and Tremont/Jacobsville
servers with CPU stepping >=4, the offset for bus number configuration
register was updated from 0xcc to 0xd0. For Ice Lake-D servers, all the
steppings use the updated 0xd0 offset.

Fix the issue by using the appropriate offset for bus number
configuration register according to the CPU model number and stepping.
