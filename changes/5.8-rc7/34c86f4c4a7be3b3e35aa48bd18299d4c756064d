crypto: af_alg - fix use-after-free in af_alg_accept() due to bh_lock_sock()

The locking in af_alg_release_parent is broken as the BH socket
lock can only be taken if there is a code-path to handle the case
where the lock is owned by process-context.  Instead of adding
such handling, we can fix this by changing the ref counts to
atomic_t.

This patch also modifies the main refcnt to include both normal
and nokey sockets.  This way we don't have to fudge the nokey
ref count when a socket changes from nokey to normal.
