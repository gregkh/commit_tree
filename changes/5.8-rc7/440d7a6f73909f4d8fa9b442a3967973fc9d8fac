clk: X1000: Add FIXDIV for SSI clock of X1000.

1.The SSI clock of X1000 not like JZ4770 and JZ4780, they are not
  directly derived from the output of SSIPLL, but from the clock
  obtained by dividing the frequency by 2. "X1000_CLK_SSIPLL_DIV2"
  is added for this purpose, and ensure that it initialized before
  "X1000_CLK_SSIMUX" when initializing the clocks.
2.Clocks of LCD, OTG, EMC, EFUSE, OST, TCU, and gates of CPU, PCLK
  are also added.
3.Use "CLK_OF_DECLARE_DRIVER" like the other CGU drivers.
