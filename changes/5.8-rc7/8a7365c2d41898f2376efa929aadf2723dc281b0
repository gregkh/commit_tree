coresight: Expose device connections via sysfs

Coresight device connections are a bit complicated and is not
exposed currently to the user. One has to look at the platform
descriptions (DT bindings or ACPI bindings) to make an understanding.
Given the new naming scheme, it will be helpful to have this information
to choose the appropriate devices for tracing. This patch exposes
the device connections via links in the sysfs directories.

e.g, for a connection devA[OutputPort_X] -> devB[InputPort_Y]
is represented as two symlinks:

  /sys/bus/coresight/.../devA/out:X -> /sys/bus/coresight/.../devB
  /sys/bus/coresight/.../devB/in:Y  -> /sys/bus/coresight/.../devA

[Revised to use the generic sysfs links functions & link structures.
Provides a connections sysfs group in each device to hold the links.]
