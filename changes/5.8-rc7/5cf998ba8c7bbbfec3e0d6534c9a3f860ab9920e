RISC-V: self-contained IPI handling routine

Currently, the IPI handling routine riscv_software_interrupt() does
not take any argument and also does not perform irq_enter()/irq_exit().

This patch makes IPI handling routine more self-contained by:
1. Passing "pt_regs *" argument
2. Explicitly doing irq_enter()/irq_exit()
3. Explicitly save/restore "pt_regs *" using set_irq_regs()

With above changes, IPI handling routine does not depend on caller
function to perform irq_enter()/irq_exit() and save/restore of
"pt_regs *" hence its more self-contained. This also enables us
to call IPI handling routine from IRQCHIP drivers.
