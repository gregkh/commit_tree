ice: Add more Rx errors to netdev's rx_error counter

Currently we are only including illegal_bytes and rx_crc_errors in the
PF netdev's rx_error counter. There are many more causes of Rx errors
that the device supports and reports via Ethtool. Accumulate all Rx
errors in the PF netdev's rx_error counter.
