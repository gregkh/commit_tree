arm64: Unify WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_AT_{NVHE,VHE}

Errata 1165522, 1319367 and 1530923 each allow TLB entries to be
allocated as a result of a speculative AT instruction. In order to
avoid mandating VHE on certain affected CPUs, apply the workaround to
both the nVHE and the VHE case for all affected CPUs.
