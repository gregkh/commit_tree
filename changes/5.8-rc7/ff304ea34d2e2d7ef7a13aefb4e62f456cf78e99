soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: tcs_is_free() can just check tcs_in_use

tcs_is_free() had two checks in it: does the software think that the
TCS is free and does the hardware think that the TCS is free.  I
couldn't figure out in which case the hardware could think that a TCS
was in-use but software thought it was free.  Apparently there is no
case and the extra check can be removed.  This apparently has already
been done in a downstream patch.
