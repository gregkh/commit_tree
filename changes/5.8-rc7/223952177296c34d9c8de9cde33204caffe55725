cfg80211: add and expose HE 6 GHz band capabilities

These capabilities cover what would otherwise be transported
in HT/VHT capabilities, but only a subset thereof that is
actually needed on 6 GHz with HE already present. Expose the
capabilities to userspace, drivers are expected to set them
as using the 6 GHz band (currently) requires HE capability.
