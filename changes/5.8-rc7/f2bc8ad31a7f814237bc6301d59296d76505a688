net: ethtool: Allow PHY cable test TDR data to configured

Allow the user to configure where on the cable the TDR data should be
retrieved, in terms of first and last sample, and the step between
samples. Also add the ability to ask for TDR data for just one pair.

If this configuration is not provided, it defaults to 1-150m at 1m
intervals for all pairs.
