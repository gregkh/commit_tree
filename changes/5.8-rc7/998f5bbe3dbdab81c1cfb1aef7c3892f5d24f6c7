s390/kasan: fix early pgm check handler execution

Currently if early_pgm_check_handler is called it ends up in pgm check
loop. The problem is that early_pgm_check_handler is instrumented by
KASAN but executed without DAT flag enabled which leads to addressing
exception when KASAN checks try to access shadow memory.

Fix that by executing early handlers with DAT flag on under KASAN as
expected.
