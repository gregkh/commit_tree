iwlwifi: move API version lookup to common code

The API version lookup is parsed from a TLV and should be in shared code
make make it reusable across all opmodes.

Also change the function names from mvm to fw, since this is not
mvm-specific anymore.

Additionally, since this function is not just a single line of code, it
shouldn't be inline.  Convert them to actual functions.
