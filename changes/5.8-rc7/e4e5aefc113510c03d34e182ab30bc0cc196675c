xsk: Change two variable names for increased clarity

Change two variables names so that it is clearer what they
represent. The first one is xsk_list that in fact only contains the
list of AF_XDP sockets with a Tx component. Change this to xsk_tx_list
for improved clarity. The second variable is size in the ring
structure. One might think that this is the size of the ring, but it
is in fact the size of the umem, copied into the ring structure to
improve performance. Rename this variable umem_size to avoid any
confusion.
