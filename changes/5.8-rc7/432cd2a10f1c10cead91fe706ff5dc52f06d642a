btrfs: fix data block group relocation failure due to concurrent scrub

When running relocation of a data block group while scrub is running in
parallel, it is possible that the relocation will fail and abort the
current transaction with an -EINVAL error:

The -EINVAL error comes from the following chain of function calls:

  __btrfs_cow_block() <-- aborts the transaction
    btrfs_reloc_cow_block()
      replace_file_extents()
        get_new_location() <-- returns -EINVAL

When relocating a data block group, for each allocated extent of the block
group, we preallocate another extent (at prealloc_file_extent_cluster()),
associated with the data relocation inode, and then dirty all its pages.
These preallocated extents have, and must have, the same size that extents
from the data block group being relocated have.

Later before we start the relocation stage that updates pointers (bytenr
field of file extent items) to point to the the new extents, we trigger
writeback for the data relocation inode. The expectation is that writeback
will write the pages to the previously preallocated extents, that it
follows the NOCOW path. That is generally the case, however, if a scrub
is running it may have turned the block group that contains those extents
into RO mode, in which case writeback falls back to the COW path.

However in the COW path instead of allocating exactly one extent with the
expected size, the allocator may end up allocating several smaller extents
due to free space fragmentation - because we tell it at cow_file_range()
that the minimum allocation size can match the filesystem's sector size.
This later breaks the relocation's expectation that an extent associated
to a file extent item in the data relocation inode has the same size as
the respective extent pointed by a file extent item in another tree - in
this case the extent to which the relocation inode poins to is smaller,
causing relocation.c:get_new_location() to return -EINVAL.

For example, if we are relocating a data block group X that has a logical
address of X and the block group has an extent allocated at the logical
address X + 128KiB with a size of 64KiB:

1) At prealloc_file_extent_cluster() we allocate an extent for the data
   relocation inode with a size of 64KiB and associate it to the file
   offset 128KiB (X + 128KiB - X) of the data relocation inode. This
   preallocated extent was allocated at block group Z;

2) A scrub running in parallel turns block group Z into RO mode and
   starts scrubing its extents;

3) Relocation triggers writeback for the data relocation inode;

4) When running delalloc (btrfs_run_delalloc_range()), we try first the
   NOCOW path because the data relocation inode has BTRFS_INODE_PREALLOC
   set in its flags. However, because block group Z is in RO mode, the
   NOCOW path (run_delalloc_nocow()) falls back into the COW path, by
   calling cow_file_range();

5) At cow_file_range(), in the first iteration of the while loop we call
   btrfs_reserve_extent() to allocate a 64KiB extent and pass it a minimum
   allocation size of 4KiB (fs_info->sectorsize). Due to free space
   fragmentation, btrfs_reserve_extent() ends up allocating two extents
   of 32KiB each, each one on a different iteration of that while loop;

6) Writeback of the data relocation inode completes;

7) Relocation proceeds and ends up at relocation.c:replace_file_extents(),
   with a leaf which has a file extent item that points to the data extent
   from block group X, that has a logical address (bytenr) of X + 128KiB
   and a size of 64KiB. Then it calls get_new_location(), which does a
   lookup in the data relocation tree for a file extent item starting at
   offset 128KiB (X + 128KiB - X) and belonging to the data relocation
   inode. It finds a corresponding file extent item, however that item
   points to an extent that has a size of 32KiB, which doesn't match the
   expected size of 64KiB, resuling in -EINVAL being returned from this
   function and propagated up to __btrfs_cow_block(), which aborts the
   current transaction.

To fix this make sure that at cow_file_range() when we call the allocator
we pass it a minimum allocation size corresponding the desired extent size
if the inode belongs to the data relocation tree, otherwise pass it the
filesystem's sector size as the minimum allocation size.
