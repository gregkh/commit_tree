nfsd4: fix nfsdfs reference count loop

We don't drop the reference on the nfsdfs filesystem with
mntput(nn->nfsd_mnt) until nfsd_exit_net(), but that won't be called
until the nfsd module's unloaded, and we can't unload the module as long
as there's a reference on nfsdfs.  So this prevents module unloading.
