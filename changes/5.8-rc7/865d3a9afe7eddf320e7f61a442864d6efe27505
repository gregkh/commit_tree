x86/mce: Address objtools noinstr complaints

Mark the relevant functions noinstr, use the plain non-instrumented MSR
accessors. The only odd part is the instrumentation_begin()/end() pair around the
indirect machine_check_vector() call as objtool can't figure that out. The
possible invoked functions are annotated correctly.

Also use notrace variant of nmi_enter/exit(). If MCEs happen then hardware
latency tracing is the least of the worries.
