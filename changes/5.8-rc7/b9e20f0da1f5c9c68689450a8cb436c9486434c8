mm, compaction: make capture control handling safe wrt interrupts

Hugh reports:

 "While stressing compaction, one run oopsed on NULL capc->cc in
  __free_one_page()'s task_capc(zone): compact_zone_order() had been
  interrupted, and a page was being freed in the return from interrupt.

  Though you would not expect it from the source, both gccs I was using
  (4.8.1 and 7.5.0) had chosen to compile compact_zone_order() with the
  ".cc = &cc" implemented by mov %rbx,-0xb0(%rbp) immediately before
  callq compact_zone - long after the "current->capture_control =
  &capc". An interrupt in between those finds capc->cc NULL (zeroed by
  an earlier rep stos).

  This could presumably be fixed by a barrier() before setting
  current->capture_control in compact_zone_order(); but would also need
  more care on return from compact_zone(), in order not to risk leaking
  a page captured by interrupt just before capture_control is reset.

  Maybe that is the preferable fix, but I felt safer for task_capc() to
  exclude the rather surprising possibility of capture at interrupt
  time"

I have checked that gcc10 also behaves the same.

The advantage of fix in compact_zone_order() is that we don't add
another test in the page freeing hot path, and that it might prevent
future problems if we stop exposing pointers to uninitialized structures
in current task.

So this patch implements the suggestion for compact_zone_order() with
barrier() (and WRITE_ONCE() to prevent store tearing) for setting
current->capture_control, and prevents page leaking with
WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE in the proper order.
