nfsd: apply umask on fs without ACL support

The server is failing to apply the umask when creating new objects on
filesystems without ACL support.

To reproduce this, you need to use NFSv4.2 and a client and server
recent enough to support umask, and you need to export a filesystem that
lacks ACL support (for example, ext4 with the "noacl" mount option).

Filesystems with ACL support are expected to take care of the umask
themselves (usually by calling posix_acl_create).

For filesystems without ACL support, this is up to the caller of
vfs_create(), vfs_mknod(), or vfs_mkdir().
