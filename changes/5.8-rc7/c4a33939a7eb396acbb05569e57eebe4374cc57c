objtool: Implement noinstr validation

Validate that any call out of .noinstr.text is in between
instr_begin() and instr_end() annotations.

This annotation is useful to ensure correct behaviour wrt tracing
sensitive code like entry/exit and idle code. When we run code in a
sensitive context we want a guarantee no unknown code is ran.

Since this validation relies on knowing the section of call
destination symbols, we must run it on vmlinux.o instead of on
individual object files.

Add two options:

 -d/--duplicate "duplicate validation for vmlinux"
 -l/--vmlinux "vmlinux.o validation"

Where the latter auto-detects when objname ends with "vmlinux.o" and
the former will force all validations, also those already done on
!vmlinux object files.
