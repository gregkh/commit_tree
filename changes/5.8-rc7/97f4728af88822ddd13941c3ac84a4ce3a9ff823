btrfs: block-group: refactor how we insert a block group item

Currently the block group item insert is pretty straight forward, fill
the block group item structure and insert it into extent tree.

However the incoming skinny block group feature is going to change this,
so this patch will refactor insertion into a new function,
insert_block_group_item(), to make the incoming feature easier to add.
