net: ks8851: Implement Parallel bus operations

Implement accessors for KS8851-16MLL/MLLI/MLLU parallel bus variant of
the KS8851. This is based off the ks8851_mll.c , which is a driver for
exactly the same hardware, however the ks8851.c code is much higher
quality. Hence, this patch pulls out the relevant information from the
ks8851_mll.c on how to access the bus, but uses the common ks8851.c
code. To make this patch reviewable, instead of rewriting ks8851_mll.c,
ks8851_mll.c is removed in a separate subsequent patch.
