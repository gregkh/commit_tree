power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Add the Meegopad T02 to the blacklist.

    The Meegopad T02 is a PC in stick format and doesn't have a battery,
    it is reported with a random and constant battery charge but as
    discharging to userspace.

    Add it to the blacklist to avoid the bogus battery status reporting.
