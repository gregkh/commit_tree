arch/arm/boot/dts/uniphier-ref-daughter.dtsi has

  compatible = "microchip,24lc128", "atmel,24c128";

  eeprom@50: compatible: ['microchip,24lc128', 'atmel,24c128'] is not valid under any of the given schemas (Possible causes of the failure)

Microchip 24LC128 is the device used on this board, and I see it in
