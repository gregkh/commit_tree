objtool: Always do header sync check

Currently, the check of tools files against kernel equivalent is only
done after every object file has been built. This means one might fix
build issues against outdated headers without seeing a warning about
this.

Check headers before any object is built. Also, make it part of a
FORCE'd recipe so every attempt to build objtool will report the
outdated headers (if any).
