usb: cdns3: ep0: delete the redundant status stage

Each setup stage will prepare status stage at cdns3_ep0_setup_phase,
it doesn't need to add extra status stage for test mode handling,
otherwise, the controller can't enter the test mode. Through the Lecroy
bus analyzer log, the controller will always wait status stage
even it is prepared by software later than the test mode is set
by software. If we comment out the status stage at cdns3_ep0_setup_phase,
the controller will not enter test mode even the test mode is set
beforehand.
