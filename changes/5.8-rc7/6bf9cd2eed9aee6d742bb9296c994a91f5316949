btrfs: fix fatal extent_buffer readahead vs releasepage race

Under somewhat convoluted conditions, it is possible to attempt to
release an extent_buffer that is under io, which triggers a BUG_ON in
btrfs_release_extent_buffer_pages.

This relies on a few different factors. First, extent_buffer reads done
as readahead for searching use WAIT_NONE, so they free the local extent
buffer reference while the io is outstanding. However, they should still
be protected by TREE_REF. However, if the system is doing signficant
reclaim, and simultaneously heavily accessing the extent_buffers, it is
possible for releasepage to race with two concurrent readahead attempts
in a way that leaves TREE_REF unset when the readahead extent buffer is
released.

Essentially, if two tasks race to allocate a new extent_buffer, but the
winner who attempts the first io is rebuffed by a page being locked
(likely by the reclaim itself) then the loser will still go ahead with
issuing the readahead. The loser's call to find_extent_buffer must also
race with the reclaim task reading the extent_buffer's refcount as 1 in
a way that allows the reclaim to re-clear the TREE_REF checked by
find_extent_buffer.

The following represents an example execution demonstrating the race:

            CPU0                                                         CPU1                                           CPU2

    find_create_tree_block                                      find_create_tree_block

                                                                  associate pages to eb
                                                                  insert eb into radix tree

          BUG_ON(io_pages > 0)!!!

We observe this at a very low rate in production and were also able to
reproduce it in a test environment by introducing some spurious delays
and by introducing probabilistic trylock_page failures.

To fix it, we apply check_tree_ref at a point where it could not
possibly be unset by a competing task: after io_pages has been
incremented. All the codepaths that clear TREE_REF check for io, so they
would not be able to clear it after this point until the io is done.
