io_uring: add IORING_CQ_EVENTFD_DISABLED to the CQ ring flags

This new flag should be set/clear from the application to
disable/enable eventfd notifications when a request is completed
and queued to the CQ ring.

Before this patch, notifications were always sent if an eventfd is
registered, so IORING_CQ_EVENTFD_DISABLED is not set during the
initialization.

It will be up to the application to set the flag after initialization
if no notifications are required at the beginning.
