habanalabs: handle barriers in DMA QMAN streams

When we have DMA QMAN with multiple streams, we need to know whether the
command buffer contains at least one DMA packet in order to configure the
barriers correctly when adding the 2xMSG_PROT at the end of the JOB. If
there is no DMA packet, then there is no need to put engine barrier. This
is relevant only for GAUDI as GOYA doesn't have streams so the engine can't
be busy by another stream.
