arm64: dts: qcom: db820c: Add vdd_gfx and tie it into mmcc

Add the SPMI regulator node in the PMI8994, use it to give us VDD_GX
at a fixed max nominal voltage for the db820c and specify this as supply
for the MMSS GPU_GX GDSC.

With the introduction of CPR support the range for VDD_GX should be
expanded.
