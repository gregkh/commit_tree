Revert "drm/amdgpu: use the BAR if possible in amdgpu_device_vram_access v2"

This reverts commit c12b84d6e0d70f1185e6daddfd12afb671791b6e.

The original patch causes a RAS event and subsequent kernel hard-hang
when running the KFDMemoryTest.PtraceAccessInvisibleVram on VG20 and
Arcturus

dmesg output at hang time:
