habanalabs: get card type, location from F/W

For Gaudi the driver gets two new additional properties from the F/W:
1. The card's type - PCI or PMC
2. The card's location in the Gaudi's box (relevant only for PMC).

The card's location is also passed to the user in the HW IP info structure
as it needs this property for establishing communication between Gaudis.
