ice: only drop link once when setting pauseparams

Currently, the ice driver is setting a PHY configuration,
which causes a link drop, and then additionally it calls
for a nway_reset, which restarts auto-negotiation on the
link, which also causes a link drop.  These two link
events in such close timing is causing the FW to not be
able to generate a link interrupt for the driver to
respond to.

Remove the unnecessary auto-negotiation restart from the
set pauseparams flow.  Also remove error path that
would have performed an ice_down/ice_up as that is
also unnecessary.
