modpost: strip .o from modname before calling new_module()

new_module() conditionally strips the .o because the modname has .o
suffix when it is called from read_symbols(), but no .o when it is
called from read_dump().

It is clearer to strip .o in read_symbols().

I also used flexible-array for mod->name.
