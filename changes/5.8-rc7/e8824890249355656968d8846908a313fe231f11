x86/delay: Preparatory code cleanup

The naming conventions in the delay code are confusing at best.

All delay variants use a loops argument and or variable which originates
from the original delay_loop() implementation. But all variants except
delay_loop() are based on TSC cycles.

Rename the argument to cycles and make it type u64 to avoid these weird
expansions to u64 in the functions.

Rename MWAITX_MAX_LOOPS to MWAITX_MAX_WAIT_CYCLES for the same reason
and fixup the comment of delay_mwaitx() as well.

Mark the delay_fn function pointer __ro_after_init and fixup the comment
for it.

No functional change and preparation for the upcoming TPAUSE based delay
variant.
