btrfs: fix wrong file range cleanup after an error filling dealloc range

If an error happens while running dellaloc in COW mode for a range, we can
end up calling extent_clear_unlock_delalloc() for a range that goes beyond
our range's end offset by 1 byte, which affects 1 extra page. This results
in clearing bits and doing page operations (such as a page unlock) outside
our target range.

Fix that by calling extent_clear_unlock_delalloc() with an inclusive end
offset, instead of an exclusive end offset, at cow_file_range().
