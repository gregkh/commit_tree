s390/pci: define RID and RID available

Firmware provides the bus/devfn part of the PCI addresses of a zPCI
function inside the new field RID of the CLP query PCI function
with a bit to know if this field is available to use.

Let's add these fields to the clp_rsp_query_pci structure,
add corresponding fields to zdev and initialize them.
