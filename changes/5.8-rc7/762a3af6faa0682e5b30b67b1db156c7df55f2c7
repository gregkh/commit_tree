exec: open code copy_string_kernel

Currently copy_string_kernel is just a wrapper around copy_strings that
simplifies the calling conventions and uses set_fs to allow passing a
kernel pointer.  But due to the fact the we only need to handle a single
kernel argument pointer, the logic can be sigificantly simplified while
getting rid of the set_fs.
