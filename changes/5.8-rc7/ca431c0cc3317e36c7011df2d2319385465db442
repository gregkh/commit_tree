KVM: VMX: Drop redundant capability checks in low level INVVPID helpers

Remove the INVVPID capabilities checks from vpid_sync_vcpu_single() and
vpid_sync_vcpu_global() now that all callers ensure the INVVPID variant
is supported.  Note, in some cases the guarantee is provided in concert
with hardware_setup(), which enables VPID if and only if at least of
invvpid_single() or invvpid_global() is supported.

Drop the WARN_ON_ONCE() from vmx_flush_tlb() as vpid_sync_vcpu_single()
will trigger a WARN() on INVVPID failure, i.e. if SINGLE_CONTEXT isn't
supported.
