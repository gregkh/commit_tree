iio: imu: adis: Add Managed device functions

This patch adds support for a managed device version of
adis_setup_buffer_and_trigger. It works exactly as the original
one but it calls all the devm_iio_* functions to setup an iio
buffer and trigger. Hence we do not need to care about cleaning those
and we do not need to support a remove() callback for every driver using
the adis library.
