ice: check for compatibility between DDP package and firmware

Require the Dynamic Device Personalization (DDP) file to have the same
major version number and the same or older minor number than the firmware
version major and minor, respectively.

Check the OS and NVM package versions before downloading the package.
If the OS package version is not compatible with NVM then return an
appropriate error.

Split the 32-byte segment name into a 28-byte segment name and
a 4-byte Track-ID. Older packages will still work with this change
because no package has a name that will take up more than 28 bytes;
in this case the Track-ID will be 0.

Note that the driver will store the segment name as 32-bytes in the
ice_hw structure, in order to normalize the length of the various
package name strings that it uses.

Also add section ID and structure for the segment metadata section.
