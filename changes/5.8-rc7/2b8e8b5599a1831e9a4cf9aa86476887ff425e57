fs: inode.c: get rid of docs warnings

Use *foo makes the toolchain to think that this is an emphasis, causing
those warnings:

	./fs/inode.c:1609: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
	./fs/inode.c:1609: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
	./fs/inode.c:1615: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

So, use, instead, ``*foo``, in order to mark it as a literal block.
