dma-pool: introduce dma_guess_pool()

dma-pool's dev_to_pool() creates the false impression that there is a
way to grantee a mapping between a device's DMA constraints and an
atomic pool. It tuns out it's just a guess, and the device might need to
use an atomic pool containing memory from a 'safer' (or lower) memory
zone.

To help mitigate this, introduce dma_guess_pool() which can be fed a
device's DMA constraints and atomic pools already known to be faulty, in
order for it to provide an better guess on which pool to use.
