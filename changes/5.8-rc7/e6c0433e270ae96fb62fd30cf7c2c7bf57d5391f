lpfc_debugfs: get rid of pointless access_ok()

	No, you do NOT need to "protect copy from user" that way.
Incidentally, your userland ABI stinks.  I understand that you
wanted to accept "reset" and "reset\n" as equivalent, but I suspect
that accepting "reset this, you !@^!@!" had been an accident.
Nothing to do about that now - it is a userland ABI...
