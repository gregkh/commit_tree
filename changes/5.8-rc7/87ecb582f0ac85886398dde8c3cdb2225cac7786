objtool: Use sec_offset_hash() for insn_hash

In preparation for find_insn_containing(), change insn_hash to use
sec_offset_hash().

This actually reduces runtime; probably because mixing in the section
index reduces the collisions due to text sections all starting their
instructions at offset 0.

Runtime on vmlinux.o from 3.1 to 2.5 seconds.
