ipv4: nexthop: Fix deadcode issue by performing a proper NULL check

After allocating the spare nexthop group it should be tested for kzalloc()
returning NULL, instead the already used nexthop group (which cannot be
NULL at this point) had been tested so far.

Additionally, if kzalloc() fails, return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) instead of NULL.
