media: ti-vpe: avoid gcc-9 warning

gcc warns about empty array declarations, which we get in this driver
when compile-testing without CONFIG_OF:

drivers/media/platform/ti-vpe/cal.c:2194:34: warning: array 'cal_of_match' assumed to have one element
 2194 | static const struct of_device_id cal_of_match[];

Since all users of this driver do need CONFIG_OF anyway, there is no
point in making the array definition conditional to save space, so
just remove the #ifdef and move the array up a little.
