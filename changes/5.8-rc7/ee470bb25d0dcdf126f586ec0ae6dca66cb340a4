EDAC/amd64: Read back the scrub rate PCI register on F15h

Commit:

  da92110dfdfa ("EDAC, amd64_edac: Extend scrub rate support to F15hM60h")

added support for F15h, model 0x60 CPUs but in doing so, missed to read
back SCRCTRL PCI config register on F15h CPUs which are *not* model
0x60. Add that read so that doing

  $ cat /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc0/sdram_scrub_rate

can show the previously set DRAM scrub rate.
