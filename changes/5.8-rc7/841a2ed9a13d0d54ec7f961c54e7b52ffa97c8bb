SUNRPC: Set SOFTCONN when destroying GSS contexts

Move the RPC_TASK_SOFTCONN flag into rpc_call_null_helper(). The
only minor behavior change is that it is now also set when
destroying GSS contexts.

This gives a better guarantee that gss_send_destroy_context() will
not hang for long if a connection cannot be established.
