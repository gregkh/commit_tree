KVM: x86: Rename ->tlb_flush() to ->tlb_flush_all()

Rename ->tlb_flush() to ->tlb_flush_all() in preparation for adding a
new hook to flush only the current ASID/context.

Opportunstically replace the comment in vmx_flush_tlb() that explains
why it flushes all EPTP/VPID contexts with a comment explaining why it
unconditionally uses INVEPT when EPT is enabled.  I.e. rely on the "all"
part of the name to clarify why it does global INVEPT/INVVPID.

No functional change intended.
