platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only blacklist SW_TABLET_MODE on the 9 / "Laptop" chasis-type

The HP Stream x360 11-p000nd no longer report SW_TABLET_MODE state / events
with recent kernels. This model reports a chassis-type of 10 / "Notebook"
which is not on the recently introduced chassis-type whitelist

Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode
switch on 2-in-1's") added a chassis-type whitelist and only listed 31 /
"Convertible" as being capable of generating valid SW_TABLET_MOD events.

Commit 1fac39fd0316 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode
switch on "Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types") extended the
whitelist with chassis-types 8 / "Portable" and 32 / "Detachable".

And now we need to exten the whitelist again with 10 / "Notebook"...

The issue original fixed by the whitelist is really a ACPI DSDT bug on
the Dell XPS 9360 where it has a VGBS which reports it is in tablet mode
even though it is not a 2-in-1 at all, but a regular laptop.

So since this is a workaround for a DSDT issue on that specific model,
instead of extending the whitelist over and over again, lets switch to
a blacklist and only blacklist the chassis-type of the model for which
the chassis-type check was added.

Note this also fixes the current version of the code no longer checking
if dmi_get_system_info(DMI_CHASSIS_TYPE) returns NULL.
