scripts: kernel-doc: proper handle @foo->bar()

The pattern @foo->bar() is valid, as it can be used by a
function pointer inside a struct passed as a parameter.

Right now, it causes a warning:

	./drivers/firewire/core-transaction.c:606: WARNING: Inline strong start-string without end-string.

In this specific case, the kernel-doc markup is:

	/**
	 * fw_core_remove_address_handler() - unregister an address handler
	 * @handler: callback
	 *
	 * To be called in process context.
	 *
	 * When fw_core_remove_address_handler() returns, @handler->callback() is
	 * guaranteed to not run on any CPU anymore.
	 */

With seems valid on my eyes. So, instead of trying to hack
the kernel-doc markup, let's teach it about how to handle
such things. This should likely remove lots of other similar
warnings as well.
