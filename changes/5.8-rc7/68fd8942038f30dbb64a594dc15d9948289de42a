net/smc: clear link during SMC client link down processing

In a link-down condition we notify the SMC server and expect that the
server will finally trigger the link clear processing on the client
side. This could fail when anything along this notification path goes
wrong. Clear the link as part of SMC client link-down processing to
prevent dangling links.
