drm/amdgpu: Avoid integer overflow in amdgpu_device_suspend_display_audio

When building with Clang:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_device.c:4160:53: warning: overflow in
expression; result is -294967296 with type 'long' [-Winteger-overflow]
                expires = ktime_get_mono_fast_ns() + NSEC_PER_SEC * 4L;
                                                                  ^
1 warning generated.

Multiplication happens first due to order of operations and both
NSEC_PER_SEC and 4 are long literals so the expression overflows. To
avoid this, make 4 an unsigned long long literal, which matches the
type of expires (u64).
