flow_dissector: Move out netns_bpf prog callbacks

Move functions to manage BPF programs attached to netns that are not
specific to flow dissector to a dedicated module named
bpf/net_namespace.c.

The set of functions will grow with the addition of bpf_link support for
netns attached programs. This patch prepares ground by creating a place
for it.

This is a code move with no functional changes intended.
