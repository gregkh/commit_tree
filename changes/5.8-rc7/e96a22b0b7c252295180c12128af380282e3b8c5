lpfc: Refactor Send LS Abort support

Send LS Abort support is needed when Send LS Request is supported.

Currently, the ability to abort an NVME LS request is limited to the nvme
(host) side of the driver.  In preparation of both the nvme and nvmet sides
supporting Send LS Abort, rework the existing ls_req abort routines such
that there is common code that can be used by both sides.

While refactoring it was seen the logic in the abort routine was incorrect.
It attempted to abort all NVME LS's on the indicated port. As such, the
routine was reworked to abort only the NVME LS request that was specified.
