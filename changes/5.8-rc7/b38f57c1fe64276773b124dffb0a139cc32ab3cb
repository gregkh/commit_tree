rcu-tasks: Allow rcu_read_unlock_trace() under scheduler locks

The rcu_read_unlock_trace() can invoke rcu_read_unlock_trace_special(),
which in turn can call wake_up().  Therefore, if any scheduler lock is
held across a call to rcu_read_unlock_trace(), self-deadlock can occur.
This commit therefore uses the irq_work facility to defer the wake_up()
to a clean environment where no scheduler locks will be held.
