iio: accel: bma180: Add support for bma023

The bma023 chip is similar enough to the bma180 and bma25x that the
same driver can support all of them.  The biggest differences are
the lack of a temperature channel and no low power but still working
mode.

The bma150 is a close relative of the bma023, but it does have a
temperature channel so support is not added for it.
