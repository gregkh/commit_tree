spi: pxa2xx: Fix runtime PM ref imbalance on probe error

The PXA2xx SPI driver releases a runtime PM ref in the probe error path
even though it hasn't acquired a ref earlier.

Apparently commit e2b714afee32 ("spi: pxa2xx: Disable runtime PM if
controller registration fails") sought to copy-paste the invocation of
pm_runtime_disable() from pxa2xx_spi_remove(), but erroneously copied
the call to pm_runtime_put_noidle() as well.  Drop it.
