powerpc/64: Have MPROFILE_KERNEL depend on FUNCTION_TRACER

Currently, it is possible to have CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER disabled, but
CONFIG_MPROFILE_KERNEL enabled. Though all existing users of
MPROFILE_KERNEL are doing the right thing, it is weird to have
MPROFILE_KERNEL enabled when the function tracer isn't. Fix this by
making MPROFILE_KERNEL depend on FUNCTION_TRACER.
