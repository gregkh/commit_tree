arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Fix ETMv4 power management patch

The lack of unique context in  '0f1decaa83b7 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180:
Support ETMv4 power management")' caused the patch to be applied
off-by-one. Move the "arm,coresight-loses-context-with-cpu" properties
down one node, so that it applies to the ETMs and not the replicator.
