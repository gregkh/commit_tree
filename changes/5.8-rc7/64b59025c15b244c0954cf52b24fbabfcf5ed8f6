xdp: Add xdp_txq_info to xdp_buff

Add xdp_txq_info as the Tx counterpart to xdp_rxq_info. At the
moment only the device is added. Other fields (queue_index)
can be added as use cases arise.

>From a UAPI perspective, add egress_ifindex to xdp context for
bpf programs to see the Tx device.

Update the verifier to only allow accesses to egress_ifindex by
XDP programs with BPF_XDP_DEVMAP expected attach type.
