s390/dasd: remove ioctl_by_bdev calls

The IBM partition parser requires device type specific information only
available to the DASD driver to correctly register partitions. The
current approach of using ioctl_by_bdev with a fake user space pointer
is discouraged.

Fix this by replacing IOCTL calls with direct in-kernel function calls.
