loop: Clean up LOOP_SET_STATUS lo_flags handling

LOOP_SET_STATUS(64) will actually allow some lo_flags to be modified; in
particular, LO_FLAGS_AUTOCLEAR can be set and cleared, whereas
LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN can be set to request a partition scan. Make this
explicit by updating the UAPI to include the flags that can be
set/cleared using this ioctl.

The implementation can then blindly take over the passed in flags,
and use the previous flags for those flags that can't be set / cleared
using LOOP_SET_STATUS.
