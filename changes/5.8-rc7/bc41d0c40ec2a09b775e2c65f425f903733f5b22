KVM: nVMX: Use vpid_sync_vcpu_addr() to emulate INVVPID with address

Use vpid_sync_vcpu_addr() to emulate the "individual address" variant of
INVVPID now that said function handles the fallback case of the (host)
CPU not supporting "individual address".

Note, the "vpid == 0" checks in the vpid_sync_*() helpers aren't
actually redundant with the "!operand.vpid" check in handle_invvpid(),
as the vpid passed to vpid_sync_vcpu_addr() is a KVM (host) controlled
value, i.e. vpid02 can be zero even if operand.vpid is non-zero.

No functional change intended.
