powerpc: module_[32|64].c: replace swap function with built-in one

Replace relaswap with built-in one, because relaswap
does a simple byte to byte swap.

Since Spectre mitigations have made indirect function calls more
expensive, and the default simple byte copies swap is implemented
without them, an "optimized" custom swap function is now
a waste of time as well as code.
