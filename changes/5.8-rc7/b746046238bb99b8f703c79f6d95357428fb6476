objtool: Better handle IRET

Teach objtool a little more about IRET so that we can avoid using the
SAVE/RESTORE annotation. In particular, make the weird corner case in
insn->restore go away.

The purpose of that corner case is to deal with the fact that
UNWIND_HINT_RESTORE lands on the instruction after IRET, but that
instruction can end up being outside the basic block, consider:

	if (cond)
		sync_core()
	foo();

Then the hint will land on foo(), and we'll encounter the restore
hint without ever having seen the save hint.

By teaching objtool about the arch specific exception frame size, and
assuming that any IRET in an STT_FUNC symbol is an exception frame
sized POP, we can remove the use of save/restore hints for this code.
