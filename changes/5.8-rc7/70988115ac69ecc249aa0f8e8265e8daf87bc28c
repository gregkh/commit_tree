drm/i915/dp: Return the right vswing tables

DDI ports have its encoders initialized with INTEL_OUTPUT_DDI type and
later eDP ports that have the type changed to INTEL_OUTPUT_EDP.
But for all other DDI ports it can drive HDMI or DP depending on what
user connects to the ports.

ehl_get_combo_buf_trans() and tgl_get_combo_buf_trans() was checking
for INTEL_OUTPUT_DP that was never true, causing wrong vswing tables
being used.

So here replacing the INTEL_OUTPUT_DP checks by the valid output types
that this functions receives as parameters. HDMI cases will be
correctly handled as it do not use encoder->type, instead it calls the
functions with INTEL_OUTPUT_HDMI as type parameter and HDMI don't have
retraining.

v2:
changed INTEL_OUTPUT_DDI to INTEL_OUTPUT_EDP and INTEL_OUTPUT_HDMI
