net/smc: delete link processing as SMC client

Add smc_llc_process_cli_delete_link() to process a DELETE_LINK request
as SMC client. When the request is to delete ALL links then terminate
the whole link group. If not, find the link to delete by its link_id,
send the DELETE_LINK response LLC message and then clear the deleted
link. Finally determine and update the link group state.
