mtd: rawnand: fsmc: Change to non-atomic bit operations

No need to use expensive atomic change_bit() on dat[] and err_idx[]:
1. fsmc_bch8_correct_data() is called while mutex chip->lock is held
2. err_idx[] is a local variable.

To avoid big endian concern due to type cast to unsigned long, directly
change the bit in the specified byte instead of using non-atomic
__change_bit().
