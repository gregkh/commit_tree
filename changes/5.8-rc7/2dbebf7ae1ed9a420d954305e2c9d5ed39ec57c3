KVM: nVMX: Plumb L2 GPA through to PML emulation

Explicitly pass the L2 GPA to kvm_arch_write_log_dirty(), which for all
intents and purposes is vmx_write_pml_buffer(), instead of having the
latter pull the GPA from vmcs.GUEST_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS.  If the dirty bit
update is the result of KVM emulation (rare for L2), then the GPA in the
VMCS may be stale and/or hold a completely unrelated GPA.
