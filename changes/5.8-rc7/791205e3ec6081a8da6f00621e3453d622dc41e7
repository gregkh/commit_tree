pstore/ram: Introduce max_reason and convert dump_oops

Now that pstore_register() can correctly pass max_reason to the kmesg
dump facility, introduce a new "max_reason" module parameter and
"max-reason" Device Tree field.

The "dump_oops" module parameter and "dump-oops" Device
Tree field are now considered deprecated, but are now automatically
converted to their corresponding max_reason values when present, though
the new max_reason setting has precedence.

For struct ramoops_platform_data, the "dump_oops" member is entirely
replaced by a new "max_reason" member, with the only existing user
updated in place.

Additionally remove the "reason" filter logic from ramoops_pstore_write(),
as that is not specifically needed anymore, though technically
this is a change in behavior for any ramoops users also setting the
printk.always_kmsg_dump boot param, which will cause ramoops to behave as
if max_reason was set to KMSG_DUMP_MAX.
