memory: Add Baikal-T1 L2-cache Control Block driver

Baikal-T1 SoC provides a way to tune the MIPS P5600 CM2 L2-cache
performance up. It can be done by changing the L2-RAM Data/Tag/WS
latencies in a dedicated register exposed by the system controller.
The driver added by this commit provides a dts properties-based and
sysfs-based interface for it. The device DT node is supposed to be a
child of Baikal-T1 System Controller node.
