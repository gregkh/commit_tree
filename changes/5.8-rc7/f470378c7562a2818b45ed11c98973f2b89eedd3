bpf: Extend bpf_base_func_proto helpers with probe_* and *current_task*

Often it is useful when applying policy to know something about the
task. If the administrator has CAP_SYS_ADMIN rights then they can
use kprobe + networking hook and link the two programs together to
accomplish this. However, this is a bit clunky and also means we have
to call both the network program and kprobe program when we could just
use a single program and avoid passing metadata through sk_msg/skb->cb,
socket, maps, etc.

To accomplish this add probe_* helpers to bpf_base_func_proto programs
guarded by a perfmon_capable() check. New supported helpers are the
following,

 BPF_FUNC_get_current_task
 BPF_FUNC_probe_read_user
 BPF_FUNC_probe_read_kernel
 BPF_FUNC_probe_read_user_str
 BPF_FUNC_probe_read_kernel_str
