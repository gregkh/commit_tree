iommu/vt-d: Set U/S bit in first level page table by default

When using first-level translation for IOVA, currently the U/S bit in the
page table is cleared which implies DMA requests with user privilege are
blocked. As the result, following error messages might be observed when
passing through a device to user level:

DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3
DMAR: [DMA Read] Request device [41:00.0] PASID 1 fault addr 7ecdcd000
        [fault reason 129] SM: U/S set 0 for first-level translation
        with user privilege

This fixes it by setting U/S bit in the first level page table and makes
IOVA over first level compatible with previous second-level translation.
