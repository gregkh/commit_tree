rcutorture: Add test of holding scheduler locks across rcu_read_unlock()

Now that it should be safe to hold scheduler locks across
rcu_read_unlock(), even in cases where the corresponding RCU read-side
critical section might have been preempted and boosted, the commit adds
a test of this capability to rcutorture.  This has been tested on current
mainline (which can deadlock in this situation), and lockdep duly reported
the expected deadlock.  On -rcu, lockdep is silent, thus far, anyway.
