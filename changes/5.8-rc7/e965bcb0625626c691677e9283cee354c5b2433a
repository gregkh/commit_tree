arm64/cpufeature: Make doublelock a signed feature in ID_AA64DFR0

Double lock feature can have the following possible values.

0b0000 - Double lock implemented
0b1111 - Double lock not implemented

But in case of a conflict the safe value should be 0b1111. Hence this must
be a signed feature instead. Also change FTR_EXACT to FTR_LOWER_SAFE. While
here, fix the erroneous bit width value from 28 to 4.
