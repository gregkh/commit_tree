hwmon: (adm1275) Make sure we are reading enough data for different chips

Issue:
When PEC is enabled, binding adm1272 to the adm1275 would
fail due to PEC error. See below:
adm1275: probe of xxxx failed with error -74

Diagnosis:
Per the datasheet of adm1272, adm1278, adm1293 and amd1294,
PMON_CONFIG (0xd4) is 16bits wide. On the other hand,
PMON_CONFIG (0xd4) for adm1275 is 8bits wide. The driver should not
assume everything is 8bits wide and read only 8bits from it.

Solution:
If it is adm1272, adm1278, adm1293 and adm1294, use i2c_read_word.
Else, use i2c_read_byte

Testing:
Binding adm1272 to the driver.
The change is only tested on adm1272.
