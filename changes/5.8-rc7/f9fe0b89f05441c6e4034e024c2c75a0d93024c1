x86/hw_breakpoint: Prevent data breakpoints on per_cpu cpu_tss_rw

cpu_tss_rw is not directly referenced by hardware, but cpu_tss_rw is
accessed in CPU entry code, especially when #DB shifts its stacks.

If a data breakpoint would be set on cpu_tss_rw.x86_tss.ist[IST_INDEX_DB],
it would cause recursive #DB ending up in a double fault.

Add it to the list of protected items.
