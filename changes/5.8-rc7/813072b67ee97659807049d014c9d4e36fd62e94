usb: cdns3: trace: using correct dir value

It should use the correct direction value from register, not depends
on previous software setting. It fixed the EP number wrong issue at
trace when the TRBERR interrupt occurs for EP0IN.

When the EP0IN IOC has finished, software prepares the setup packet
request, the expected direction is OUT, but at that time, the TRBERR
for EP0IN may occur since it is DMULT mode, the DMA does not stop
until TRBERR has met.
