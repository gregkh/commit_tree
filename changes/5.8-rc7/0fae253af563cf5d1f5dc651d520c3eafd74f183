ASoC: soc-devres: add devm_snd_soc_register_dai()

The registration of DAIs may be done at two distinct times, once
during a component registration and later when loading a
topology. Since devm_ managed resources are freed in the reverse order
they were allocated, when a component starts unregistering DAIs by
walking through the DAI list, the memory allocated for the
topology-registered DAIs was freed already, which leads to 100%
reproducible KASAN use-after-free reports.

This patch suggests a new devm_ function to force the DAI list to be
updated prior to freeing the memory chunks referenced by the list
pointers.
