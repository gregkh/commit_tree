drm/i915/gt: Move the batch buffer pool from the engine to the gt

Since the introduction of 'soft-rc6', we aim to park the device quickly
and that results in frequent idling of the whole device. Currently upon
idling we free the batch buffer pool, and so this renders the cache
ineffective for many workloads. If we want to have an effective cache of
recently allocated buffers available for reuse, we need to decouple that
cache from the engine powermanagement and make it timer based. As there
is no reason then to keep it within the engine (where it once made
retirement order easier to track), we can move it up the hierarchy to the
owner of the memory allocations.

v2: Hook up to debugfs/drop_caches to clear the cache on demand.
