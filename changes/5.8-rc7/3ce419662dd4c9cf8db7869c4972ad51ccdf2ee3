scsi: iscsi: Register sysfs for iscsi workqueue

This patch enables setting cpu affinity through "cpumask" for iscsi
workqueues (iscsi_q_xx and iscsi_eh), so as to get performance isolation.

The max number of active worker was changed form 1 to 2, because "cpumask"
of ordered workqueue isn't allowed to change.
