x86/cpu/amd: Make erratum #1054 a legacy erratum

Commit

  21b5ee59ef18 ("x86/cpu/amd: Enable the fixed Instructions Retired
		 counter IRPERF")

mistakenly added erratum #1054 as an OS Visible Workaround (OSVW) ID 0.
Erratum #1054 is not OSVW ID 0 [1], so make it a legacy erratum.

There would never have been a false positive on older hardware that
has OSVW bit 0 set, since the IRPERF feature was not available.

However, save a couple of RDMSR executions per thread, on modern
system configurations that correctly set non-zero values in their
OSVW_ID_Length MSRs.
