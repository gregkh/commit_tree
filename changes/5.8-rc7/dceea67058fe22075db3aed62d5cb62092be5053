xhci: Fix incorrect EP_STATE_MASK

EP_STATE_MASK should be 0x7 instead of 0xf

xhci spec 6.2.3 shows that the EP state field in the endpoint context data
structure consist of bits [2:0].
The old value included a bit from the next field which fortunately is a
 RsvdZ region. So hopefully this hasn't caused too much harm
