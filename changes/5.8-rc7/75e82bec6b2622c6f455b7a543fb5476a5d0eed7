s390/qdio: put thinint indicator after early error

qdio_establish() calls qdio_setup_thinint() via qdio_setup_irq().
If the subsequent qdio_establish_thinint() fails, we miss to put the
DSCI again. Thus the DSCI isn't available for re-use. Given enough of
such errors, we could end up with having only the shared DSCI available.

Merge qdio_setup_thinint() into qdio_establish_thinint(), and deal with
such an error internally.
