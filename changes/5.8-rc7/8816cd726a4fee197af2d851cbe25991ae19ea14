rtc: mc13xxx: fix a double-unlock issue

In function mc13xxx_rtc_probe, the mc13xxx_unlock() is called
before rtc_register_device(). But in the error path of
rtc_register_device(), the mc13xxx_unlock() is called again,
which causes a double-unlock problem. Thus add a call of the
function “mc13xxx_lock” in an if branch for the completion
of the exception handling.
