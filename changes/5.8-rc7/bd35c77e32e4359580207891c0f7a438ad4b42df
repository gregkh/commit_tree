x86/tsc: Add tsc_early_khz command line parameter

Changing base clock frequency directly impacts TSC Hz but not CPUID.16h
value. An overclocked CPU supporting CPUID.16h and with partial CPUID.15h
support will set TSC KHZ according to "best guess" given by CPUID.16h
relying on tsc_refine_calibration_work to give better numbers later.
tsc_refine_calibration_work will refuse to do its work when the outcome is
off the early TSC KHZ value by more than 1% which is certain to happen on
an overclocked system.

Fix this by adding a tsc_early_khz command line parameter that makes the
kernel skip early TSC calibration and use the given value instead.

This allows the user to provide the expected TSC frequency that is closer
to reality than the one reported by the hardware, enabling
tsc_refine_calibration_work to do meaningful error checking.

[ tglx: Made the variable __initdata as it's only used on init and
        removed the error checking in the argument parser because
	kstrto*() only stores to the variable if the string is valid ]
