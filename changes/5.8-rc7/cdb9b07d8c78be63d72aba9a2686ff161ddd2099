kcsan: Make reporting aware of KCSAN tests

Reporting hides KCSAN runtime functions in the stack trace, with
filtering done based on function names. Currently this included all
functions (or modules) that would match "kcsan_". Make the filter aware
of KCSAN tests, which contain "kcsan_test", and are no longer skipped in
the report.

This is in preparation for adding a KCSAN test module.
