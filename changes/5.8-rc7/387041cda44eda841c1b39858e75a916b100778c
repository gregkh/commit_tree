media: atomisp: improve sensor detection code to use _DSM table

Instead of keep hardcoding device-specific tables, read them
directly from the ACPI BIOS, if available.

This method is know to work with Asus T101HA device. the
same table is also visible on EzPad devices. So, it seems
that at least some BIOSes use this method to pass data about
ISP2401-connected sensors.
