exit: Move preemption fixup up, move blocking operations down

With CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y and CONFIG_CGROUPS=y, kernel oopses in
non-preemptible context look untidy; after the main oops, the kernel prints
a "sleeping function called from invalid context" report because
exit_signals() -> cgroup_threadgroup_change_begin() -> percpu_down_read()
can sleep, and that happens before the preempt_count_set(PREEMPT_ENABLED)
fixup.

It looks like the same thing applies to profile_task_exit() and
kcov_task_exit().

Fix it by moving the preemption fixup up and the calls to
profile_task_exit() and kcov_task_exit() down.
