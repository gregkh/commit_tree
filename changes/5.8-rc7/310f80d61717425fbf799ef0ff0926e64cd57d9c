vexpress: Move setting master site to vexpress-config bus

There's only a single caller of vexpress_config_set_master() from
vexpress-sysreg.c. Let's just make the registers needed available to
vexpress-config and move all the code there. The registers needed aren't
used anywhere else either. With this, we can get rid of the private API
between these 2 drivers.
