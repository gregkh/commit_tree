RDMA/rtrs: Get rid of the do_next_path while_next_path macros

The macros do_each_path/while_each_path lead to a smatch warning:

drivers/infiniband/ulp/rtrs/rtrs-clt.c:1196 rtrs_clt_failover_req() warn: inconsistent indenting
drivers/infiniband/ulp/rtrs/rtrs-clt.c:2890 rtrs_clt_request() warn: inconsistent indenting

Also checkpatch complains:
ERROR: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop

The macros are used only in two places: for a normal IO path and for the
failover path triggered after errors.

Get rid of the macros and just use a for loop iterating over the list of
paths in both places. It is easier to read and also less lines of code.
