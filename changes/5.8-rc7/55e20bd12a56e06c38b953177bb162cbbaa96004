Revert "btrfs: switch to iomap_dio_rw() for dio"

This reverts commit a43a67a2d715540c1368b9501a22b0373b5874c0.

This patch reverts the main part of switching direct io implementation
to iomap infrastructure. There's a problem in invalidate page that
couldn't be solved as regression in this development cycle.

The problem occurs when buffered and direct io are mixed, and the ranges
overlap. Although this is not recommended, filesystems implement
measures or fallbacks to make it somehow work. In this case, fallback to
buffered IO would be an option for btrfs (this already happens when
direct io is done on compressed data), but the change would be needed in
the iomap code, bringing new semantics to other filesystems.

Another problem arises when again the buffered and direct ios are mixed,
invalidation fails, then -EIO is set on the mapping and fsync will fail,
though there's no real error.

There have been discussions how to fix that, but revert seems to be the
least intrusive option.
