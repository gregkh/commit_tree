net: dsa: microchip: call phy_remove_link_mode during probe

When doing "ip link set dev ... up" for a ksz9477 backed link,
ksz9477_phy_setup is called and it calls phy_remove_link_mode to remove
1000baseT HDX. During phy_remove_link_mode, phy_advertise_supported is
called. Doing so reverts any previous change to advertised link modes
e.g. using a udevd .link file.

phy_remove_link_mode is not meant to be used while opening a link and
should be called during phy probe when the link is not yet available to
userspace.

Therefore move the phy_remove_link_mode calls into
ksz9477_switch_register. It indirectly calls dsa_register_switch, which
creates the relevant struct phy_devices and we update the link modes
right after that. At that time dev->features is already initialized by
ksz9477_switch_detect.

Remove phy_setup from ksz_dev_ops as no users remain.
