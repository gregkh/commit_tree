bpf: Fix check_return_code to only allow [0,1] in trace_iter progs

As per 15d83c4d7cef ("bpf: Allow loading of a bpf_iter program") we only
allow a range of [0,1] for return codes. Therefore BPF_TRACE_ITER relies
on the default tnum_range(0, 1) which is set in range var. On recent merge
of net into net-next commit e92888c72fbd ("bpf: Enforce returning 0 for
fentry/fexit progs") got pulled in and caused a merge conflict with the
changes from 15d83c4d7cef. The resolution had a snall hiccup in that it
removed the [0,1] range restriction again so that BPF_TRACE_ITER would
have no enforcement. Fix it by adding it back.
