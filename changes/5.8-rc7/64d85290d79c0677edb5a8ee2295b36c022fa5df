bpf: Allow bpf_map_lookup_elem for SOCKMAP and SOCKHASH

White-list map lookup for SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH from BPF. Lookup returns a
pointer to a full socket and acquires a reference if necessary.

To support it we need to extend the verifier to know that:

 (1) register storing the lookup result holds a pointer to socket, if
     lookup was done on SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH, and that

 (2) map lookup on SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH is a reference acquiring operation,
     which needs a corresponding reference release with bpf_sk_release.

On sock_map side, lookup handlers exposed via bpf_map_ops now bump
sk_refcnt if socket is reference counted. In turn, bpf_sk_select_reuseport,
the only in-kernel user of SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH ops->map_lookup_elem, was
updated to release the reference.

Sockets fetched from a map can be used in the same way as ones returned by
BPF socket lookup helpers, such as bpf_sk_lookup_tcp. In particular, they
can be used with bpf_sk_assign to direct packets toward a socket on TC
ingress path.
