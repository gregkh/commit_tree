habanalabs: re-factor H/W queues initialization

We want to remove the following restrictions/assumptions in our driver:
1. The H/W queue index is also the completion queue index.
2. The H/W queue index is also the IRQ number of the completion queue.
3. All queues of the same type have consecutive indexes.

Therefore we add the support for H/W queues of the same type with
nonconsecutive indexes and completion queue index and IRQ number different
than the H/W queue index.
