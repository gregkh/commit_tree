staging: gasket: Fix mapping refcnt leak when put attribute fails

gasket_sysfs_put_attr() invokes get_mapping(), which returns a reference
of the specified gasket_sysfs_mapping object to "mapping" with increased
refcnt.

When gasket_sysfs_put_attr() returns, local variable "mapping" becomes
invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.

The reference counting issue happens in one path of
gasket_sysfs_put_attr(). When mapping attribute is unknown, the function
forgets to decrease the refcnt increased by get_mapping(), causing a
refcnt leak.

Fix this issue by calling put_mapping() when put attribute fails due to
unknown attribute.
