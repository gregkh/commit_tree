nexthop: support for fdb ecmp nexthops

This patch introduces ecmp nexthops and nexthop groups
for mac fdb entries. In subsequent patches this is used
by the vxlan driver fdb entries. The use case is
E-VPN multihoming [1,2,3] which requires bridged vxlan traffic
to be load balanced to remote switches (vteps) belonging to
the same multi-homed ethernet segment (This is analogous to
a multi-homed LAG but over vxlan).

Changes include new nexthop flag NHA_FDB for nexthops
referenced by fdb entries. These nexthops only have ip.
This patch includes appropriate checks to avoid routes
referencing such nexthops.

example:
$ip nexthop add id 12 via 172.16.1.2 fdb
$ip nexthop add id 13 via 172.16.1.3 fdb
$ip nexthop add id 102 group 12/13 fdb

$bridge fdb add 02:02:00:00:00:13 dev vxlan1000 nhid 101 self
