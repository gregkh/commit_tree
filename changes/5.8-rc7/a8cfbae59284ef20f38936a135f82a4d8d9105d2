KVM: VMX: replace "fall through" with "return" to indicate different case

The second "/* fall through */" in rmode_exception() makes code harder to
read. Replace it with "return" to indicate they are different cases, only
the #DB and #BP check vcpu->guest_debug, while others don't care. And this
also improves the readability.
