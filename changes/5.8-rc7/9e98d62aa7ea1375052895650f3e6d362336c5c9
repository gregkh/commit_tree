objtool: Remove check preventing branches within alternative

While jumping from outside an alternative region to the middle of an
alternative region is very likely wrong, jumping from an alternative
region into the same region is valid. It is a common pattern on arm64.

The first pattern is unlikely to happen in practice and checking only
for this adds a lot of complexity.

Just remove the current check.
