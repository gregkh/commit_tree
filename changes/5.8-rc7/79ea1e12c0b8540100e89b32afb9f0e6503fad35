cfg80211: fix management registrations deadlock

Lockdep reports that we may deadlock because we take the RTNL on
the work struct, but flush it under RTNL. Clearly, it's correct.
In practice, this can happen when doing rfkill on an active device.

Fix this by moving the work struct to the wiphy (registered dev)
layer, and iterate over all the wdevs inside there. This then
means we need to track which one of them has work to do, so we
don't update to the driver for all wdevs all the time.

Also fix a locking bug I noticed while working on this - the
registrations list is iterated as if it was an RCU list, but it
isn't handle that way - and we need to lock now for the update
flag anyway, so remove the RCU.
