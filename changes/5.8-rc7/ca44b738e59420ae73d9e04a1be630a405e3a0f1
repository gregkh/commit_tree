net: sched: implement terse dump support in act

Extend tcf_action_dump() with boolean argument 'terse' that is used to
request terse-mode action dump. In terse mode only essential data needed to
identify particular action (action kind, cookie, etc.) and its stats is put
to resulting skb and everything else is omitted. Implement
tcf_exts_terse_dump() helper in cls API that is intended to be used to
request terse dump of all exts (actions) attached to the filter.
