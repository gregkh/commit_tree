KVM: nVMX: Move VM-Fail check out of nested_vmx_exit_reflected()

Check for VM-Fail on nested VM-Enter in nested_vmx_reflect_vmexit() in
preparation for separating nested_vmx_exit_reflected() into separate "L0
wants exit exit" and "L1 wants the exit" helpers.

Explicitly set exit_intr_info and exit_qual to zero instead of reading
them from vmcs02, as they are invalid on VM-Fail (and thankfully ignored
by nested_vmx_vmexit() for nested VM-Fail).
