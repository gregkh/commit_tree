selftests: vdso: Use a header file to prototype parse_vdso API

Both vdso_test_gettimeofday and vdso_standalone_test_x86 use the library in
parse_vdso.c but each separately declares the API it offers which is not
ideal. Create a header file with prototypes of the functions and use it in
both the library and the tests to ensure that the same prototypes are used
throughout.
