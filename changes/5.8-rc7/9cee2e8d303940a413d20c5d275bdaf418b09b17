net: hns3: remove two duplicated register macros in hclgevf_main.h

HCLGEVF_CMDQ_INTR_SRC_REG and HCLGEVF_CMDQ_INTR_STS_REG are same
as HCLGEVF_VECTOR0_CMDQ_SRC_REG and HCLGEVF_VECTOR0_CMDQ_STAT_REG,
replace the former with the latter, and rename macro
HCLGEVF_VECTOR0_CMDQ_STAT_REG since 'stat' is not abbreviation of
'state'.
