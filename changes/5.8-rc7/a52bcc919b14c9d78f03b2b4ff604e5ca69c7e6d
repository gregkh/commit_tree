net/smc: improve termination processing

Add helper smcr_lgr_link_deactivate_all() and eliminate duplicate code.
In smc_lgr_free(), clear the smc-r links before smc_lgr_free_bufs() is
called so buffers are already prepared for free. The usage of the soft
parameter in __smc_lgr_terminate() is no longer needed, smc_lgr_free()
can be called directly. smc_lgr_terminate_sched() and
smc_smcd_terminate() set lgr->freeing to indicate that the link group
will be freed soon to avoid unnecessary schedules of the free worker.
