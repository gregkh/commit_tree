btrfs: drop unnecessary offset_in_page in extent buffer helpers

Helpers that iterate over extent buffer pages set up several variables,
one of them is finding out offset of the extent buffer start within a
page. Right now we have extent buffers aligned to page sizes so this is
effectively storing zero. This makes the code harder the follow and can
be simplified.

The same change is done in all the helpers:

* remove: size_t start_offset = offset_in_page(eb->start);
* simplify code using start_offset
