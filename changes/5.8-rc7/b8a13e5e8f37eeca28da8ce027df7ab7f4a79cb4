hwmon: (dell-smm) Use one DMI match for all XPS models

Currently, each new XPS has to be added manually for module autoloading
to work. Since fan multiplier autodetection should work fine on all XPS
models, just match them all with one block like is done for Precision
and Studio.

The only match we replace that doesn't already use autodetection is
"XPS13" which, according to Google, only matches the XPS 13 9333. (All
other XPS 13 models have "XPS" as its own word, surrounded by spaces.)
According to the thread at [1], autodetection works for the XPS 13 9333,
meaning this shouldn't regress it. I do not own one to confirm with,
though.

Tested on an XPS 13 9350 and confirmed the module now autoloads and
reports reasonable-looking data. I am using BIOS 1.12.2 and do not see
any freezes when querying fan speed.
