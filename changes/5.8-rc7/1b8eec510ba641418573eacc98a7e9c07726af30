selftests/ftrace: Support ":README" suffix for requires

Add ":README" suffix support for the requires list, so that
the testcase can list up the required string for README file
to the requires list.

Note that the required string is treated as a fixed string,
instead of regular expression. Also, the testcase can specify
a string containing spaces with quotes. E.g.

# requires: "place: [<module>:]<symbol>":README
