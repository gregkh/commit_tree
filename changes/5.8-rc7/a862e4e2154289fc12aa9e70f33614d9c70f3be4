dm mpath: simplify __must_push_back

Remove micro-optimization that infers device is between presuspend and
resume (was done purely to avoid call to dm_noflush_suspending, which
isn't expensive anyway).

Remove flags argument since they are no longer checked.

And remove must_push_back_bio() since it was simply a call to
__must_push_back().
