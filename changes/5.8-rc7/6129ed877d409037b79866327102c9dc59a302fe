KVM: x86/mmu: Set mmio_value to '0' if reserved #PF can't be generated

Set the mmio_value to '0' instead of simply clearing the present bit to
squash a benign warning in kvm_mmu_set_mmio_spte_mask() that complains
about the mmio_value overlapping the lower GFN mask on systems with 52
bits of PA space.

Opportunistically clean up the code and comments.
