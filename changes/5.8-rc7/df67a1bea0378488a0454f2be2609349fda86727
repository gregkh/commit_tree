iwlwifi: pcie: use seq_file for tx_queue debugfs file

On newer hardware, the tx_queue debugfs file would need to
allocate 37.5kib data since there are 512 queues, which is
too much. Rather than resorting to kludges like kvmalloc(),
use the seq_file API to print out the data.

While at it, also fix a NULL pointer dereference here, the
txq pointer from trans_pcie->txqs[] may be NULL if that
queue hasn't been allocated.
