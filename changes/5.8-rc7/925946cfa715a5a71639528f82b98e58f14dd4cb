x86/mce: Change default MCE logger to check mce->kflags

Instead of keeping count of how many handlers are registered on the
MCE notifier chain and printing if below some magic value, look at
mce->kflags to see if anyone claims to have handled/logged this error.

 [ bp: Do not print ->kflags in __print_mce(). ]
