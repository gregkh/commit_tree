mlxsw: spectrum: Use separate trap group for FID miss

When a packet enters the device it is classified to a filtering
identifier (FID) based on the ingress port and VLAN. The FID miss trap
is used to trap packets for which a FID could not be found.

In mlxsw this trap should only be triggered when a port is enslaved to
an OVS bridge and a matching ACL rule could not be found, so as to
trigger learning.

These packets are therefore completely unrelated to packets hitting
local routes and should be in a different group. Move them.
