media: atomisp: atomisp_v4l2.c: set wdt timers according with ISP version

Add a runtime check to use the proper wdt timer init at runtime,
depending on the chipset revision.

For now, we can't get rid of the remaining version checks, as
the rest of the code is not prepared yet to detect the ISP
version on runtime.
