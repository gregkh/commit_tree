arm64: dts: rockchip: fix &pinctrl phy sub nodename for rk3399-nanopi4

A test with the command below gives for example this error:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-nanopc-t4.dt.yaml: phy:
'#phy-cells' is a required property
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-nanopi-m4.dt.yaml: phy:
'#phy-cells' is a required property
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-nanopi-neo4.dt.yaml: phy:
'#phy-cells' is a required property

'phy' is a reserved nodename and should not be used for pinctrl,
so change it to 'gmac'.
