serial: 8250: Support rs485 bus termination GPIO

Commit e8759ad17d41 ("serial: uapi: Add support for bus termination")
introduced the ability to enable rs485 bus termination from user space.
So far the feature is only used by a single driver, 8250_exar.c, using a
hardcoded GPIO pin specific to Siemens IOT2040 products.

Provide for a more generic solution by allowing specification of an
rs485 bus termination GPIO pin in the device tree:  Amend the serial
core to retrieve the GPIO from the device tree (or ACPI table) and amend
the default ->rs485_config() callback for 8250 drivers to change the
GPIO on request from user space.

Perhaps 8250_exar.c can be converted to the generic approach in a
follow-up patch.
