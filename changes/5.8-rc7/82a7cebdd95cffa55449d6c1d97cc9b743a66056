powerpc: Fix misleading small cores print

Currently when we boot on a big core system, we get this print:
  [    0.040500] Using small cores at SMT level

This is misleading as we've actually detected big cores.

This patch clears up the print to say we've detect big cores but are
using small cores for scheduling.
