Documentation: LSM: Correct the basic LSM description

This is a first pass at updating the basic documentation on
Linux Security Modules (LSM), which is frighteningly out of date.
Remove untrue statements about the LSM framework. Replace them
with true statements where it is convenient to do so. This is
the beginnig of a larger effort to bring the LSM documentation
up to date.
