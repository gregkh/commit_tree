scsi: ufs: Don't update urgent bkops level when toggling auto bkops

Urgent bkops level is used to compare against actual bkops status read from
UFS device. Urgent bkops level is set during initialization and might be
updated in exception event handler during runtime. But it should not be
updated to the actual bkops status every time when auto bkops is toggled.
Otherwise, if urgent bkops level is updated to 0, auto bkops shall always
be kept enabled.
