staging: comedi: addi_apci_1500: check INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG shift

The `INSN_CONFIG` comedi instruction with sub-instruction code
`INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG` includes a base channel in `data[3]`. This is
used as a right shift amount for other bitmask values without being
checked.  Shift amounts greater than or equal to 32 will result in
undefined behavior.  Add code to deal with this, adjusting the checks
for invalid channels so that enabled channel bits that would have been
lost by shifting are also checked for validity.  Only channels 0 to 15
are valid.
