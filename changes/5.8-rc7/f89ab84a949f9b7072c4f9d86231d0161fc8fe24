media: imx: imx7-mipi-csis: Don't use imx-media-utils helpers

The imx7-mipi-csis only uses the imx_media_init_mbus_fmt() function from
the imx-media-utils helpers. The helpers don't support all the media bus
formats used by this driver, and are thus a bad fit. As the MIPI CSIS is
a standalone IP core that could be integrated in other SoCs, let's not
use the helper.
