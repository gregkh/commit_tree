mmc: meson-gx: limit segments to 1 when dram-access-quirk is needed

The actual max_segs computation leads to failure while using the broadcom
sdio brcmfmac/bcmsdh driver, since the driver tries to make usage of
scatter gather.

But with the dram-access-quirk we use a 1,5K SRAM bounce buffer, and the
max_segs current value of 3 leads to max transfers to 4,5k, which doesn't
work.

This patch sets max_segs to 1 to better describe the hardware limitation,
and fix the SDIO functionality with the brcmfmac/bcmsdh driver on Amlogic
G12A/G12B SoCs on boards like SEI510 or Khadas VIM3.
