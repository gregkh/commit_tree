KVM: nVMX: Pull exit_reason from vcpu_vmx in nested_vmx_reflect_vmexit()

Grab the exit reason from the vcpu struct in nested_vmx_reflect_vmexit()
instead of having the exit reason explicitly passed from the caller.
This fixes a discrepancy between VM-Fail and VM-Exit handling, as the
VM-Fail case is already handled by checking vcpu_vmx, e.g. the exit
reason previously passed on the stack is bogus if vmx->fail is set.

Not taking the exit reason on the stack also avoids having to document
that nested_vmx_reflect_vmexit() requires the full exit reason, as
opposed to just the basic exit reason, which is not at all obvious since
the only usages of the full exit reason are for tracing and way down in
prepare_vmcs12() where it's propagated to vmcs12.

No functional change intended.
