cfg80211: change internal management frame registration API

Almost all drivers below cfg80211 get the API wrong (except for
cfg80211) and are unable to cope with multiple registrations for
the same frame type, which is valid due to the match filter.
This seems to indicate the API is wrong, and we should maintain
the full information in cfg80211 instead of the drivers.

Change the API to no longer inform the driver about individual
registrations and unregistrations, but rather every time about
the entire state of the entire wiphy and single wdev, whenever
it may have changed. This also simplifies the code in cfg80211
as it no longer has to track exactly what was unregistered and
can free things immediately.
