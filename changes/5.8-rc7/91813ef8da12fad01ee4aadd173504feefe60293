usb: typec: ucsi: set USB data role when partner type is power cable/ufp

Currently UCSI framework doesn't update USB data role when partner type
is reported as power cable or power cable with ufp connected. This
results into no USB host mode functionality. This is valid usecase where
user wants to use legacy type c power cable with type a female connector
to attach different USB devices like mouse, thumb drive etc. Hence update
USB data role as host when partner type is reported as power cable or
power cable with ufp connected.
