IB/hfi1: Add functions to transmit datagram ipoib packets

This patch implements the mechanism to accelerate the transmit side of
a multiple transmit queue RDMA netdev by submitting the packets to
the SDMA engine directly instead of sending through the verbs layer.

This patch also changes the UD/SEND_ONLY op to output the entropy value
in byte 0 of deth[1]. UD/SEND_ONLY_WITH_IMMEDIATE uses the previous
behavior with no entropy value being output.

The code in the ipoib rdma netdev which submits tx requests upon
successful submission will call trace_sdma_output_ibhdr to output
the ibhdr to the trace buffer.
