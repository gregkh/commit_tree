firmware: xilinx: Add sysfs and API to set boot health status

Add sysfs interface to set boot health status from user space.
Add API used by this interface to communicate with firmware.

If PMUFW is compiled with CHECK_HEALTHY_BOOT, it will check the
healthy bit on FPD WDT expiration. If healthy bit is set by a user
application running in Linux, PMUFW will do APU only restart. If
healthy bit is not set during FPD WDT expiration, PMUFW will do
system restart.
