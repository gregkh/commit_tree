ASoC: wm8962: Use force clear for WM8962_SYSCLK_ENA after reset

When CLOCKING2 is non-volatile register, we need force clear
the WM8962_SYSCLK_ENA bit after reset, for the value in cache
maybe 0 but in hardware it is 1. Otherwise there will issue
as below statement in driver.

/* SYSCLK defaults to on; make sure it is off so we can safely
 * write to registers if the device is declocked.
