ARM: dts: exynos: Fix GPIO polarity for thr GalaxyS3 CM36651 sensor's bus

GPIO lines for the CM36651 sensor I2C bus use the normal not the inverted
polarity. This bug has been there since adding the CM36651 sensor by
commit 85cb4e0bd229 ("ARM: dts: add cm36651 light/proximity sensor node
for exynos4412-trats2"), but went unnoticed because the "i2c-gpio"
driver ignored the GPIO polarity specified in the device-tree.

The recent conversion of "i2c-gpio" driver to the new, descriptor based
GPIO API, automatically made it the DT-specified polarity aware, what
broke the CM36651 sensor operation.
