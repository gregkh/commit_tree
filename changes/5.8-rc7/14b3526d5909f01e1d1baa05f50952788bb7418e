iommu/vt-d: Allow PCI sub-hierarchy to use DMA domain

Before commit fa954e6831789 ("iommu/vt-d: Delegate the dma domain
to upper layer"), Intel IOMMU started off with all devices in the
identity domain, and took them out later if it found they couldn't
access all of memory. This required devices behind a PCI bridge to
use a DMA domain at the beginning because all PCI devices behind
the bridge use the same source-id in their transactions and the
domain couldn't be changed at run-time.

Intel IOMMU driver is now aligned with the default domain framework,
there's no need to keep this requirement anymore.
