igc: Add support for taprio offloading

Adds support for translating taprio schedules into i225 cycles. This
will allow schedules to run in the hardware, making the schedules
enforcement more precise and saving CPU time.

Right now, the only simple schedules are allowed, complex schedules are
rejected. "simple" in this context are schedules that each HW queue is
opened and closed only once in each cycle.

Changing schedules is still not supported as well.
