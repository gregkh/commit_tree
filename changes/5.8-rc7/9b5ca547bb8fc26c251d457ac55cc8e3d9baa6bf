drm/nouveau/disp/gm200-: detect and potentially disable HDA support on some SORs

Some HDA pin widgets may be disabled by BIOS, and unavailable from a
SOR.  Our SOR allocation policy uses this information to allocate an
appropriate SOR when HDA is supported by a display.

Thank you to NVIDIA for providing the information to determine this.
