usb: typec: Ensure USB_ROLE_SWITCH is set as a dependency for tps6598x

When I switched on USB role switching for the tps6598x I completely forgot
to add the Kconfig dependency.

Ensure USB_ROLE_SWITCH is selected to prevent the typs6598x driver being
compiled in but the role-switch driver being compiled as a module, leading
to link error.
