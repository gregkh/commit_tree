nl80211: simplify peer specific TID configuration

Current rule for applying TID configuration for specific peer looks overly
complicated. No need to reject new TID configuration when override flag is
specified. Another call with the same TID configuration, but without
override flag, allows to apply new configuration anyway.

Use the same approach as for the 'all peers' case: if override flag is
specified, then reset existing TID configuration and immediately
apply a new one.
