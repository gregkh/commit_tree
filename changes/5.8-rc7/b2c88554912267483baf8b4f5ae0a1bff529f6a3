kbuild: update modules.order only when contained modules are updated

Make modules.order depend on $(obj-m), and use if_changed to build it.
This will avoid unneeded update of modules.order, which will be useful
to optimize the modpost stage.

Currently, the second pass of modpost is always invoked. By checking the
timestamp of modules.order, we can avoid the unneeded modpost.
