net/smc: move add link processing for new device into llc layer

When a new ib device is up smc will send an add link invitation to the
peer if needed. This is currently done with rudimentary flow control.
Under high workload these add link invitations can disturb other llc
flows because they arrive unexpected. Fix this by integrating the
invitations into the normal llc event flow and handle them as a flow.
While at it, check for already assigned requests in the flow before
the new add link request is assigned.
