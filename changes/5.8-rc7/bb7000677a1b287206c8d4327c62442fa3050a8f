soc: qcom: rpmh: Update dirty flag only when data changes

Currently rpmh ctrlr dirty flag is set for all cases regardless of data
is really changed or not. Add changes to update dirty flag when data is
changed to newer values. Update dirty flag everytime when data in batch
cache is updated since rpmh_flush() may get invoked from any CPU instead
of only last CPU going to low power mode.

Also move dirty flag updates to happen from within cache_lock and remove
unnecessary INIT_LIST_HEAD() call and a default case from switch.
