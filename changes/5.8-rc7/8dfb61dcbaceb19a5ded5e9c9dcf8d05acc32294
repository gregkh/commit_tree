kbuild: add variables for compression tools

Allow user to use alternative implementations of compression tools,
such as pigz, pbzip2, pxz. For example, multi-threaded tools to
speed up the build:
$ make GZIP=pigz BZIP2=pbzip2

Variables _GZIP, _BZIP2, _LZOP are used internally because original env
vars are reserved by the tools. The use of GZIP in gzip tool is obsolete
since 2015. However, alternative implementations (e.g., pigz) still rely
on it. BZIP2, BZIP, LZOP vars are not obsolescent.

The credit goes to @grsecurity.

As a sidenote, for multi-threaded lzma, xz compression one can use:
$ export XZ_OPT="--threads=0"
