powerpc/8xx: Add a function to early map kernel via huge pages

Add a function to early map kernel memory using huge pages.

For 512k pages, just use standard page table and map in using 512k
pages.

For 8M pages, create a hugepd table and populate the two PGD
entries with it.

This function can only be used to create page tables at startup. Once
the regular SLAB allocation functions replace memblock functions,
this function cannot allocate new pages anymore. However it can still
update existing mappings with new protections.

hugepd_none() macro is moved into asm/hugetlb.h to be usable outside
of mm/hugetlbpage.c

early_pte_alloc_kernel() is made visible.

_PAGE_HUGE flag is now displayed by ptdump.
