arm64: docs: Mandate that the I-cache doesn't hold stale kernel text

Although we require that the loaded kernel Image has been cleaned to the
PoC, we neglect to spell out the state of the I-cache. Although this
should be reasonably obvious, it doesn't hurt to be explicit.

Require that the I-cache doesn't hold any stale entries for the kernel
Image at boot.
