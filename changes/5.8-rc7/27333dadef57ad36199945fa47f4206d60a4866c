media: atomisp: adjust some code at sh_css that could be broken

When checking sh_css.c against the Yocto Aero's version, it can
be noticed that some isp2401 dependencies may have been taken
wrongly.

Change the code to work like the Yocto Aero, as this driver
was tested in the past with an ISP2401 device.
