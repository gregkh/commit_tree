PM: hibernate: Incorporate concurrency handling

Hibernation concurrency handling is currently delegated to user.c,
where it's also used for regulating the access to the snapshot device.

In the prospective of making user.c a separate configuration option,
such mutual exclusion is brought into hibernate.c and made available
through accessor helpers hereby introduced.
