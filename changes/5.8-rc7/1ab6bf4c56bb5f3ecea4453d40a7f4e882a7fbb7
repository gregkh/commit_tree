staging: wfx: do not wait for a dtim before associate

The only reason we ask to mac80211 to wait for a dtim before to
associate is to get an accurate DTIM value. However, we can temporary
set the dtim period to 1. Then we can waiting for
BSS_CHANGED_BEACON_INFO for the real value. Thus, the association
process is faster.
