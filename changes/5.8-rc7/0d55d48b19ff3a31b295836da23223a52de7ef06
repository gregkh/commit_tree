scripts: kernel-doc: accept blank lines on parameter description

Sphinx is very pedantic with respect to blank lines. Sometimes,
in order to make it to properly handle something, we need to
add a blank line. However, currently, any blank line inside a
kernel-doc comment like:

	/*
	 * @foo: bar
         *
	 *       foobar
	 *
	 * some description

will be considered as if "foobar" was part of the description.

This patch changes kernel-doc behavior. After it, foobar will
be considered as part of the parameter text. The description
will only be considered as such if it starts with:

zero spaces after asterisk:

	*foo

one space after asterisk:
	* foo

or have a explicit Description section:

	*   Description:
