timer: Prevent base->clk from moving backward

When a timer is enqueued with a negative delta (ie: expiry is below
base->clk), it gets added to the wheel as expiring now (base->clk).

Yet the value that gets stored in base->next_expiry, while calling
trigger_dyntick_cpu(), is the initial timer->expires value. The
resulting state becomes:

	base->next_expiry < base->clk

On the next timer enqueue, forward_timer_base() may accidentally
rewind base->clk. As a possible outcome, timers may expire way too
early, the worst case being that the highest wheel levels get spuriously
processed again.

To prevent from that, make sure that base->next_expiry doesn't get below
base->clk.
