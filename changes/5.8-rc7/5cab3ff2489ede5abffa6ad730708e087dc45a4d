soundwire: bus: rename sdw_bus_master_add/delete, add arguments

In preparation for future extensions, rename functions to use
sdw_bus_master prefix and add a parent and fwnode argument to
sdw_bus_master_add to help with device registration in follow-up
patches.

No functionality change, just renames and additional arguments.

The Intel code is currently unused, the two additional arguments are
only needed for compilation.
