selftests: bpf: Fix detach from sockmap tests

Fix sockmap tests which rely on old bpf_prog_dispatch behaviour.
In the first case, the tests check that detaching without giving
a program succeeds. Since these are not the desired semantics,
invert the condition. In the second case, the clean up code doesn't
supply the necessary program fds.
