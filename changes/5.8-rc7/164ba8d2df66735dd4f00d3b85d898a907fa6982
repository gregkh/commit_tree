scsi: lpfc: Maintain atomic consistency of queue_claimed flag

A previous change introduced the atomic use of queue_claimed flag for eq's
and cq's.  The code works fine, but the clearing of the queue_claimed flag
is not atomic.

Change queue_claimed = 0 into xchg(&queue_claimed, 0) to be consistent for
change under atomicity.
