media: atomisp: Clean up non-existing folders from Makefile

Compiler is not happy about leftovers:

  cc1: warning: .../pci/hrt/: No such file or directory [-Wmissing-include-dirs]
  cc1: warning: .../pci/hive_isp_css_include/memory_access/: No such file or directory [-Wmissing-include-dirs]
  cc1: warning: .../pci/css_2400_system/hrt/: No such file or directory [-Wmissing-include-dirs]

Drop them from Makefile.
