block: remove the error argument to the block_bio_complete tracepoint

The status can be trivially derived from the bio itself.  That also avoid
callers like NVMe to incorrectly pass a blk_status_t instead of the errno,
and the overhead of translating the blk_status_t to the errno in the I/O
completion fast path when no tracing is enabled.
