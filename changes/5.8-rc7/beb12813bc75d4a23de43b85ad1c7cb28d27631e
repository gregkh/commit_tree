rtlwifi: Fix a double free in _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup()

Seven years ago we tried to fix a leak but actually introduced a double
free instead.  It was an understandable mistake because the code was a
bit confusing and the free was done in the wrong place.  The "skb"
pointer is freed in both _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup() and _rtl_usb_transmit().
The free belongs _rtl_usb_transmit() instead of _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup()
and I've cleaned the code up a bit to hopefully make it more clear.
