irqchip/sifive-plic: Setup cpuhp once after boot CPU handler is present

For multiple PLIC instances, the plic_init() is called once for each
PLIC instance. Due to this we have two issues:
1. cpuhp_setup_state() is called multiple times
2. plic_starting_cpu() can crash for boot CPU if cpuhp_setup_state()
   is called before boot CPU PLIC handler is available.

Address both issues by only initializing the HP notifiers when
the boot CPU setup is complete.
