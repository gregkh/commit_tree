ALSA: hda: add member to store ratio for stripe control

Stripe control programming is governed by following formula, which is
referenced from the HD Audio specification(Revision 1.0a).
  { ((num_channels * bits_per_sample) / number of SDOs) >= 8 }

Currently above is implemented in snd_hdac_get_stream_stripe_ctl().
This patch introduces a structure member to store the default factor
of '8'. If any HW wants to use a different value, this member can be
easily updated.
