afs: Use the serverUnique field in the UVLDB record to reduce rpc ops

The U-version VLDB volume record retrieved by the VL.GetEntryByNameU rpc op
carries a change counter (the serverUnique field) for each fileserver
listed in the record as backing that volume.  This is incremented whenever
the registration details for a fileserver change (such as its address
list).  Note that the same value will be seen in all UVLDB records that
refer to that fileserver.

This should be checked before calling the VL server to re-query the address
list for a fileserver.  If it's the same, there's no point doing the query.
