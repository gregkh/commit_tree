powerpc/papr_scm: Improve error logging and handling papr_scm_ndctl()

Since papr_scm_ndctl() can be called from outside papr_scm, its
exposed to the possibility of receiving NULL as value of 'cmd_rc'
argument. This patch updates papr_scm_ndctl() to protect against such
possibility by assigning it pointer to a local variable in case cmd_rc
== NULL.

Finally the patch also updates the 'default' add a debug log unknown
'cmd' values.
