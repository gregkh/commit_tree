pinctrl: bcm2835: Add support for wake-up interrupts

Leverage the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND flag in order to avoid having to
specifically treat the GPIO interrupts during suspend and resume, and
simply implement an irq_set_wake() callback that is responsible for
enabling the parent wake-up interrupt as a wake-up interrupt.

To avoid allocating unnecessary resources for other chips, the wake-up
interrupts are only initialized if we have a brcm,bcm7211-gpio
compatibility string.
