gpio: pca953x: Fix direction setting when configure an IRQ

The commit 0f25fda840a9 ("gpio: pca953x: Zap ad-hoc reg_direction cache")
seems inadvertently made a typo in pca953x_irq_bus_sync_unlock().

When the direction bit is 1 it means input, and the piece of code in question
was looking for output ones that should be turned to inputs.

Fix direction setting when configure an IRQ by injecting a bitmap complement
operation.
