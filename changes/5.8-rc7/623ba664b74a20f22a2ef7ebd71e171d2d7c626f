gfs2: When freezing gfs2, use GL_EXACT and not GL_NOCACHE

Before this patch, the freeze code in gfs2 specified GL_NOCACHE in
several places. That's wrong because we always want to know the state
of whether the file system is frozen.

There was also a problem with freeze/thaw transitioning the glock from
frozen (EX) to thawed (SH) because gfs2 will normally grant glocks in EX
to processes that request it in SH mode, unless GL_EXACT is specified.
Therefore, the freeze/thaw code, which tried to reacquire the glock in
SH mode would get the glock in EX mode, and miss the transition from EX
to SH. That made it think the thaw had completed normally, but since the
glock was still cached in EX, other nodes could not freeze again.

This patch removes the GL_NOCACHE flag to allow the freeze glock to be
cached. It also adds the GL_EXACT flag so the glock is fully transitioned
from EX to SH, thereby allowing future freeze operations.
