net: devres: define a separate devres structure for devm_alloc_etherdev()

Not using a proxy structure to store struct net_device doesn't save
anything in terms of compiled code size or memory usage but significantly
decreases the readability of the code with all the pointer casting.

Define struct net_device_devres and use it in devm_alloc_etherdev_mqs().
