KVM: x86: interrupt based APF 'page ready' event delivery

Concerns were expressed around APF delivery via synthetic #PF exception as
in some cases such delivery may collide with real page fault. For 'page
ready' notifications we can easily switch to using an interrupt instead.
Introduce new MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_INT mechanism and deprecate the legacy one.

One notable difference between the two mechanisms is that interrupt may not
get handled immediately so whenever we would like to deliver next event
(regardless of its type) we must be sure the guest had read and cleared
previous event in the slot.

While on it, get rid on 'type 1/type 2' names for APF events in the
documentation as they are causing confusion. Use 'page not present'
and 'page ready' everywhere instead.
