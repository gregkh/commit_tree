net/mlx5e: Rename ICOSQ WQE info struct and field

Structs mlx5e_txqsq and mlx5e_xdpsq contain wqe_info arrays to store
supplementary information corresponding to WQEs in the queue. Struct
mlx5e_icosq also has such an array, but it's called differently -
ico_wqe. This patch renames it to unify with the other SQs.

In addition, rename the struct to emphasize its specific usage.
