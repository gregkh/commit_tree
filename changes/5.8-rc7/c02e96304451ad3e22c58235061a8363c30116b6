mips: loongsoon2ef: remove private clk api

As platforms are moving to COMMON_CLK in general, loongson2ef
stuck out as something that has a private implementation but
does not actually use it except for setting the frequency of
the CPU itself from the loongson2_cpufreq driver.

Change that driver to call the register setting function directly
and remove the rest of the stub implementation.
