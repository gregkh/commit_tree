sc16is7xx: Allow sharing the IRQ line

When the interrupt line is shared with other devices, the IRQ must be
level-triggered, as only one device can trigger a falling edge. To support
this, try to acquire the IRQ with IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW|IRQF_SHARED first.

Interrupt controllers that lack support for level-triggers will return an
error, in which case the driver will now retry the acqusition with
IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING, which was also the default before.
