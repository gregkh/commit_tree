media: atomisp: fix size of delay_frames array

Right now, the variables that define the max number of
delay frames is defined as:

	#define VIDEO_FRAME_DELAY		2
	#define MAX_NUM_VIDEO_DELAY_FRAMES	(VIDEO_FRAME_DELAY + 1)
	#define NUM_PREVIEW_DVS_FRAMES          (2)
	#define MAX_NUM_DELAY_FRAMES   MAX(MAX_NUM_VIDEO_DELAY_FRAMES, NUM_PREVIEW_DVS_FRAMES)

In other words, we have:
	MAX_NUM_VIDEO_DELAY_FRAMES = 3
	MAX_NUM_DELAY_FRAMES = 2

The MAX_NUM_DELAY_FRAMES macro is used only only when allocating
memory. On all other parts, including looping over such array,
MAX_NUM_VIDEO_DELAY_FRAMES is used instead, like:

	void sh_css_binary_args_reset(struct sh_css_binary_args *args)
	{
		unsigned int i;
	...

		for (i = 0; i < MAX_NUM_VIDEO_DELAY_FRAMES; i++)
			args->delay_frames[i] = NULL;

Which will cause buffer overflows, with may override the next array
(tnr_frames[]).

In practice, this may not be causing real issues, as the code
checks for num_delay_frames on some parts (but not everywhere).

So, get rid of the smallest value.
