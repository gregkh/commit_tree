media: atomisp: remove non-used 32-bits consts at system_local

There is an abstraction at the code in order to support
32 or 64 bits address/data length. However, for all
Atom chipsets supported by this version, the size is fixed.

So, cleanup the mess, removing the uused code and placing
the data sizes on a single place.

The end goal is to completely remove those local/global
headers, replacing them by some ISP-version dependent struct,
in order for the driver to decide what version it would need
in runtime.
