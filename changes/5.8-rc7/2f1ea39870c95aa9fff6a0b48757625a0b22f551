scsi: qedi: Remove additional char from boot target iqnname

While parsing the iSCSI TLV data to MFW request, a newline was added to the
firmware boot target iqnname string. Because of this, we were getting the
following error even after the boot target was successfully logged in:

"[qedi_get_protocol_tlv_data:1197]:1: Boot target not set"

Remove the trailing newline.
