media: venus: vdec: Init registered list unconditionally

Presently the list initialization is done only in
dynamic-resolution-change state, which leads to list corruptions
and use-after-free. Init list_head unconditionally in
vdec_stop_capture called by vb2 stop_streaming without takeing
into account current codec state.
