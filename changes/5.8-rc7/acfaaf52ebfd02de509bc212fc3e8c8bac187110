ASoC: txx9: don't work around too small resource_size_t

The txx9 sound driver deends on HAS_TXX9_ACLC, which is only set for
three tx49xx SOCs, and thus always has a 64-bit phys_addr_t and
resource_size_t.  Instead of poking into ioremap internals to work
around a potentially too small resource_size_t just add a BUILD_BUG_ON
to catch such a case.
