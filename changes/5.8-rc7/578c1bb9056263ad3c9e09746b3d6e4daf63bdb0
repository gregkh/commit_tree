xen/xenbus: let xenbus_map_ring_valloc() return errno values only

Today xenbus_map_ring_valloc() can return either a negative errno
value (-ENOMEM or -EINVAL) or a grant status value. This is a mess as
e.g -ENOMEM and GNTST_eagain have the same numeric value.

Fix that by turning all grant mapping errors into -ENOENT. This is
no problem as all callers of xenbus_map_ring_valloc() only use the
return value to print an error message, and in case of mapping errors
the grant status value has already been printed by __xenbus_map_ring()
before.
