ASoC: tlv320adcx140: Fix warnings when using W=1

Fix the warnings when using the W=1 compiler flag.

sound/soc/codecs/tlv320adcx140.c: In function ‘adcx140_reset’:
sound/soc/codecs/tlv320adcx140.c:570:6: warning: variable ‘ret’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  570 |  int ret = 0;
      |      ^~~

This was set but only used in case where the reset GPIO is not defined.
Have the function return the value of ret.

sound/soc/codecs/tlv320adcx140.c:778:18: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false [-Wtype-limits]

This condition will not occur since if the dt property is not set then
the *_source variable is set to the default value.  So there is no way
that *_source can be less then 0.  Which is what each #define is set to.
The code just needs to make sure that the dt property is not out of the
upper bounds.
