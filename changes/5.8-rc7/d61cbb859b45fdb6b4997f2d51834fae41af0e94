perf report TUI: Fix segmentation fault in perf_evsel__hists_browse()

The segmentation fault can be reproduced as following steps:

1) Executing perf report in tui.

2) Typing '/xxxxx' to filter the symbol to get nothing matched.

3) Pressing enter with no entry selected.

Then it will report a segmentation fault.

It is caused by the lack of check of browser->he_selection when
accessing it's member res_samples in perf_evsel__hists_browse().

These processes are meaningful for specified samples, so we can skip
these when nothing is selected.
