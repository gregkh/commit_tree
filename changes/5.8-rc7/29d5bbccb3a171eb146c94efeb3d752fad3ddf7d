bonding: Add helper function to get the xmit slave in rr mode

Add helper function to get the xmit slave when bond is in round
robin mode. Change bond_xmit_slave_id to bond_get_slave_by_id, then
the logic for find the next slave for transmit could be used
both by the xmit flow and the .ndo to get the xmit slave.
