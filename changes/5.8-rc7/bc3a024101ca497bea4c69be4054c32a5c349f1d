ice: fix potential double free in probe unrolling

If ice_init_interrupt_scheme fails, ice_probe will jump to clearing up
the interrupts. This can lead to some static analysis tools such as the
compiler sanitizers complaining about double free problems.

Since ice_init_interrupt_scheme already unrolls internally on failure,
there is no need to call ice_clear_interrupt_scheme when it fails. Add
a new unroll label and use that instead.
