drm/vkms: Hold gem object while still in-use

We need to keep the reference to the drm_gem_object
until the last access by vkms_dumb_create.

Therefore, the put the object after it is used.

This fixes a use-after-free issue reported by syzbot.

While here, change vkms_gem_create() symbol to static.
