fs: move fiemap range validation into the file systems instances

Replace fiemap_check_flags with a fiemap_prep helper that also takes the
inode and mapped range, and performs the sanity check and truncation
previously done in fiemap_check_range.  This way the validation is inside
the file system itself and thus properly works for the stacked overlayfs
case as well.
