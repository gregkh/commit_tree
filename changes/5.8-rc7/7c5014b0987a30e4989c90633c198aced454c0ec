loop: Call loop_config_discard() only after new config is applied

loop_set_status() calls loop_config_discard() to configure discard for
the loop device; however, the discard configuration depends on whether
the loop device uses encryption, and when we call it the encryption
configuration has not been updated yet. Move the call down so we apply
the correct discard configuration based on the new configuration.
