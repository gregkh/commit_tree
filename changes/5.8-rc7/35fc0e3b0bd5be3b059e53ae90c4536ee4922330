rculist: Add hlists_swap_heads_rcu

Using the struct pid to refer to two tasks in de_thread was a clever
idea and ultimately too clever, as it has lead to proc_flush_task
being called inconsistently.

To support rectifying this add hlists_swap_heads_rcu.  An hlist
primitive that just swaps the hlist heads of two lists.  This is
exactly what is needed for exchanging the pids of two tasks.

Only consideration of correctness of the code has been given,
as the caller is expected to be a slowpath.
