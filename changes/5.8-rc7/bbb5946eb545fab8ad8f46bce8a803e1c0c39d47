mips: MAAR: Use more precise address mask

Indeed according to the MIPS32 Privileged Resource Architecgture the MAAR
pair register address field either takes [12:31] bits for non-XPA systems
and [12:55] otherwise. In any case the current address mask is just
wrong for 64-bit and 32-bits XPA chips. So lets extend it to 59-bits
of physical address value. This shall cover the 64-bits architecture and
systems with XPA enabled, and won't cause any problem for non-XPA 32-bit
systems, since address values exceeding the architecture specific MAAR
mask will be just truncated with setting zeros in the unsupported upper
bits.
