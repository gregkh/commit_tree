efi/libstub: Move the function prototypes to header file

The prototype of the functions handle_kernel_image & efi_enter_kernel
are defined in efi-stub.c which may result in a compiler warnings if
-Wmissing-prototypes is set in gcc compiler.

Move the prototype to efistub.h to make the compiler happy.
