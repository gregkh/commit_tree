x86/cr4: Sanitize CR4.PCE update

load_mm_cr4_irqsoff() is really a strange name for a function which has
only one purpose: Update the CR4.PCE bit depending on the perf state.

Rename it to update_cr4_pce_mm(), move it into the tlb code and provide a
function which can be invoked by the perf smp function calls.

Another step to remove exposure of cpu_tlbstate.

No functional change.
