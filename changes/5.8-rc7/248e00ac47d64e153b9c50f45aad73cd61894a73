bpf: cgroup: Allow multi-attach program to replace itself

When using BPF_PROG_ATTACH to attach a program to a cgroup in
BPF_F_ALLOW_MULTI mode, it is not possible to replace a program
with itself. This is because the check for duplicate programs
doesn't take the replacement program into account.

Replacing a program with itself might seem weird, but it has
some uses: first, it allows resetting the associated cgroup storage.
Second, it makes the API consistent with the non-ALLOW_MULTI usage,
where it is possible to replace a program with itself. Third, it
aligns BPF_PROG_ATTACH with bpf_link, where replacing itself is
also supported.

Sice this code has been refactored a few times this change will
only apply to v5.7 and later. Adjustments could be made to
commit 1020c1f24a94 ("bpf: Simplify __cgroup_bpf_attach") and
commit d7bf2c10af05 ("bpf: allocate cgroup storage entries on attaching bpf programs")
as well as commit 324bda9e6c5a ("bpf: multi program support for cgroup+bpf")
