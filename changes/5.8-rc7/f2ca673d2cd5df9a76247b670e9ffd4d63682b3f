net: mvneta: fix use of state->speed

When support for short preambles was added, it incorrectly keyed its
decision off state->speed instead of state->interface.  state->speed
is not guaranteed to be correct for in-band modes, which can lead to
short preambles being unexpectedly disabled.

Fix this by keying off the interface mode, which is the only way that
mvneta can operate at 2.5Gbps.
