arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Include interconnect definitions

Re-introduce the include of the sc7180 interconnect node name
definitions. Though this was part of v5 of the interconnect provider
series [1], it was dropped because the DT changes went through a
different tree than the header. Re-add that now.

Interconnect clients being introduced can reference this patch as a
dependency, rather than racing each other to add the include.
