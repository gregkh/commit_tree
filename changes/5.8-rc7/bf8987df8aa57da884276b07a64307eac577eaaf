ice: set VF default LAN address

Remove is_zero_ether_add() check when setting the VF default LAN address.
This check assumed that the address had been delete and zeroed before
calling ice_vc_add_mac_addr(). Now the default LAN address will be set
to the last unicast MAC address added by the VF.

The default LAN address is reported by the PF via ndo_get_vf_config.
