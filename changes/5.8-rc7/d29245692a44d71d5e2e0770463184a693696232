tcp: ipv6: support RFC 6069 (TCP-LD)

Make tcp_ld_RTO_revert() helper available to IPv6, and
implement RFC 6069 :

Quoting this RFC :

3. Connectivity Disruption Indication

   For Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) [RFC2460], the counterpart of
   the ICMP destination unreachable message of code 0 (net unreachable)
   and of code 1 (host unreachable) is the ICMPv6 destination
   unreachable message of code 0 (no route to destination) [RFC4443].
   As with IPv4, a router should generate an ICMPv6 destination
   unreachable message of code 0 in response to a packet that cannot be
   delivered to its destination address because it lacks a matching
   entry in its routing table.
