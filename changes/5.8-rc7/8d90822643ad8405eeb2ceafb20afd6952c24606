crypto: engine - support for batch requests

Added support for batch requests, per crypto engine.
A new callback is added, do_batch_requests, which executes a
batch of requests. This has the crypto_engine structure as argument
(for cases when more than one crypto-engine is used).
The crypto_engine_alloc_init_and_set function, initializes
crypto-engine, but also, sets the do_batch_requests callback.
On crypto_pump_requests, if do_batch_requests callback is
implemented in a driver, this will be executed. The link between
the requests will be done in driver, if possible.
do_batch_requests is available only if the hardware has support
for multiple request.
