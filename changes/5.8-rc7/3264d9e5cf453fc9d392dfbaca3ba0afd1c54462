dt-bindings: i2c: Convert DW I2C binding to DT schema

Modern device tree bindings are supposed to be created as YAML-files
in accordance with dt-schema. This commit replaces Synopsys DW I2C
legacy bare text bindings with YAML file. As before the bindings file
states that the corresponding dts node is supposed to be compatible
either with generic DW I2C controller or with Microsemi Ocelot SoC I2C
one, to have registers, interrupts and clocks properties. In addition
the node may have clock-frequency, i2c-sda-hold-time-ns,
i2c-scl-falling-time-ns and i2c-sda-falling-time-ns optional properties.
