get rid of compat_mc_getsockopt()

now we can do MCAST_MSFILTER in compat ->getsockopt() without
playing silly buggers with copying things back and forth.
We can form a native struct group_filter (sans the variable-length
tail) on stack, pass that + pointer to the tail of original request
to the helper doing the bulk of the work, then do the rest of
copyout - same as the native getsockopt() does.
