pinctrl: rza1: Fix wrong array assignment of rza1l_swio_entries

The rza1l_swio_entries referred to the wrong array rza1h_swio_pins,
which was intended to be rza1l_swio_pins. So let's fix it.

This is detected by the following gcc warning:

drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-rza1.c:401:35: warning: ‘rza1l_swio_pins’
defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 static const struct rza1_swio_pin rza1l_swio_pins[] = {
                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
