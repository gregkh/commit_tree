RDMA/hns: Optimize the usage of MTR

Currently, the MTR region is configed before hns_roce_mtr_map() is
invoked, but in some scenarios, the region is configed at MTR creation,
the caller need to store this config and call hns_roce_mtr_map() later. So
optimize the usage by wrapping the MTR region config into MTR.
