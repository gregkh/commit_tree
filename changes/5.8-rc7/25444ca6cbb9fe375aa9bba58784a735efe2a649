drm/i915/fbc: Require linear fb stride to be multiple of 512 bytes on gen9/glk

Display WA #1105 says that FBC requires PLANE_STRIDE to be a multiple
of 512 bytes on gen9 and glk.

This is definitely true for glk as certain tests (such as
igt/kms_big_fb/linear-16bpp-rotate-0) are now failing when the
display resolution results in a plane stride which is not a
multiple of 512 bytes.

Curiously I was not able to reproduce this on a KBL. First I
suspected that our use of the FBC override stride explain this,
but after trying to use the override stride on glk the test
still failed. I did try both the old CHICKEN_MISC_4 way and
the new FBC_STRIDE way, neither had any effect on the result.

Anyways, we need this at least on glk. But let's trust the spec
and apply the w/a for all gen9 as well, despite being unable to
reproduce the problem.
