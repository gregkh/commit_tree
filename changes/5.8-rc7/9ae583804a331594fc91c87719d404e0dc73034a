scsi: fnic: make vnic_wq_get_ctrl and vnic_wq_alloc_ring static

Fix the following sparse warning:

drivers/scsi/fnic/vnic_wq.c:28:5: warning: symbol 'vnic_wq_get_ctrl' was
not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/scsi/fnic/vnic_wq.c:40:5: warning: symbol 'vnic_wq_alloc_ring'
was not declared. Should it be static?
