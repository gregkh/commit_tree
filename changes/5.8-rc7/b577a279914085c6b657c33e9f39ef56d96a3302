pinctrl: samsung: Correct setting of eint wakeup mask on s5pv210

Commit a8be2af0218c ("pinctrl: samsung: Write external wakeup interrupt
mask") started writing the eint wakeup mask from the pinctrl driver.
Unfortunately, it made the assumption that the private retention data
was always a regmap while in the case of s5pv210 it is a raw pointer
to the clock base (as the eint wakeup mask not in the PMU as with newer
Exynos platforms).
