PCI: Avoid Pericom USB controller OHCI/EHCI PME# defect

Both Pericom OHCI and EHCI devices advertise PME# support from all power
states:

  06:00.0 USB controller [0c03]: Pericom Semiconductor PI7C9X442SL USB OHCI Controller [12d8:400e] (rev 01) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
    Subsystem: Pericom Semiconductor PI7C9X442SL USB OHCI Controller [12d8:400e]
    Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 3
      Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=375mA PME(D0+,D1+,D2+,D3hot+,D3cold+)

  06:00.2 USB controller [0c03]: Pericom Semiconductor PI7C9X442SL USB EHCI Controller [12d8:400f] (rev 01) (prog-if 20 [EHCI])
    Subsystem: Pericom Semiconductor PI7C9X442SL USB EHCI Controller [12d8:400f]
    Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 3
      Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=375mA PME(D0+,D1+,D2+,D3hot+,D3cold+)

But testing shows that it's unreliable: there is a 20% chance PME# won't be
asserted when a USB device is plugged.

Remove PME support for both devices to make USB plugging work reliably.
