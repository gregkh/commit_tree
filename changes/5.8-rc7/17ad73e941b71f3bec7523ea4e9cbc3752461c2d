AX.25: Prevent integer overflows in connect and sendmsg

We recently added some bounds checking in ax25_connect() and
ax25_sendmsg() and we so we removed the AX25_MAX_DIGIS checks because
they were no longer required.

Unfortunately, I believe they are required to prevent integer overflows
so I have added them back.
