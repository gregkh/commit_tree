perf evsel: Add support for synthesized sample type

For reporting purposes, an evsel sample can have a callchain synthesized
from AUX area data. Add support for keeping track of synthesized sample
types. Note, the recorded sample_type cannot be changed because it is
needed to continue to parse events.
