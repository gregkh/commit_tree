tracing: Add hist_debug trace event files for histogram debugging

Add a new "hist_debug" file for each trace event, which when read will
dump out a bunch of internal details about the hist triggers defined
on that event.

This is normally off but can be enabled by saying 'y' to the new
CONFIG_HIST_TRIGGERS_DEBUG config option.

This is in support of the new Documentation file describing histogram
internals, Documentation/trace/histogram-design.rst, which was
requested by developers trying to understand the internals when
extending or making use of the hist triggers for higher-level tools.

The histogram-design.rst documentation refers to the hist_debug files
and demonstrates their use with output in the test examples.
