serial: Allow uart_get_rs485_mode() to return errno

We're about to amend uart_get_rs485_mode() to support a GPIO pin for
rs485 bus termination.  Retrieving the GPIO descriptor may fail, so
allow uart_get_rs485_mode() to return an errno and change all callers
to check for failure.

The GPIO descriptor is going to be stored in struct uart_port.  Pass
that struct to uart_get_rs485_mode() in lieu of a struct device and
struct serial_rs485, both of which are directly accessible from struct
uart_port.

A few drivers call uart_get_rs485_mode() before setting the struct
device pointer in struct uart_port.  Shuffle those calls around where
necessary.
