net/mlx5e: Introduce kconfig var for TC support

In order to improve code maintainability and readability, introduce new
CONFIG_MLX5_CLS_ACT kconfig variable to control compilation of TC hardware
offloads implementation. This allows distinguishing between features that
require TC support (MPLSoUDP, etc.) and features that just rely on
representor functionality (rep_bond for live migration, etc.).

Modify rep_tc.h, rep_neigh.h, en_tc.h and chains.h files to provide stubs
for functions that are called from generic code.
