dma-remap: align the size in dma_common_*_remap()

Running a guest with a virtio-iommu protecting virtio devices
is broken since commit 515e5b6d90d4 ("dma-mapping: use vmap insted
of reimplementing it"). Before the conversion, the size was
page aligned in __get_vm_area_node(). Doing so fixes the
regression.
