net/mlx5: reduce stack usage in qp_read_field

Moving the mlx5_ifc_query_qp_out_bits structure on the stack was a bit
excessive and now causes the compiler to complain on 32-bit architectures:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/debugfs.c: In function 'qp_read_field':
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/debugfs.c:274:1: error: the frame size of 1104 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

Revert the previous patch partially to use dynamically allocation as
the code did before. Unfortunately there is no good error handling
in case the allocation fails.
