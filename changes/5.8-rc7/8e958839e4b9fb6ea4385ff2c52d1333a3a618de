sparc32: mm: Restructure sparc32 MMU page-table layout

The "SRMMU" supports 4k pages using a fixed three-level walk with a
256-entry PGD and 64-entry PMD/PTE levels. In order to fill a page
with a 'pgtable_t', the SRMMU code allocates four native PTE tables
into a single PTE allocation and similarly for the PMD level, leading
to an array of 16 physical pointers in a 'pmd_t'

This breaks the generic code which assumes READ_ONCE(*pmd) will be
word sized.

In a manner similar to ef22d8abd876 ("m68k: mm: Restructure Motorola
MMU page-table layout"), this patch implements the native page-table
setup directly. This significantly increases the page-table memory
overhead, but will be addresses in a subsequent patch.
