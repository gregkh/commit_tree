drm/amdgpu: turn back rlcg write for gfx_v10

There is no need to use amdgpu_mm_wreg_mmio_rlc()
during initialization time because this interface
is only designed for debugfs case to access the
registers which are only permitted by RLCG during
run-time. Therefore, turn back rlcg write for gfx_v10.
If we not turn back it, it will raise amdgpu load failure.
