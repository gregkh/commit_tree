KVM: x86: Print symbolic names of VMX VM-Exit flags in traces

Use __print_flags() to display the names of VMX flags in VM-Exit traces
and strip the flags when printing the basic exit reason, e.g. so that a
failed VM-Entry due to invalid guest state gets recorded as
"INVALID_STATE FAILED_VMENTRY" instead of "0x80000021".

Opportunstically fix misaligned variables in the kvm_exit and
kvm_nested_vmexit_inject tracepoints.
