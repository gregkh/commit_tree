powerpc/mm: drop platform defined pmd_mknotpresent()

Patch series "mm/thp: Rename pmd_mknotpresent() as pmd_mknotvalid()", v2.

This series renames pmd_mknotpresent() as pmd_mknotvalid().  Before that
it drops an existing pmd_mknotpresent() definition from powerpc platform
which was never required as it defines it's pmdp_invalidate() through
subscribing __HAVE_ARCH_PMDP_INVALIDATE.  This does not create any
functional change.

This rename was suggested by Catalin during a previous discussion while we
were trying to change the THP helpers on arm64 platform for migration.

This patch (of 2):

Platform needs to define pmd_mknotpresent() for generic pmdp_invalidate()
only when __HAVE_ARCH_PMDP_INVALIDATE is not subscribed.  Otherwise
platform specific pmd_mknotpresent() is not required.  Hence just drop it.
