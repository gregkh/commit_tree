SUNRPC: Restructure svc_tcp_recv_record()

Refactor: svc_recvfrom() is going to be converted to read into
bio_vecs in a moment. Unhook the only other caller,
svc_tcp_recv_record(), which just wants to read the 4-byte stream
record marker into a kvec.

While we're in the area, streamline this helper by straight-lining
the hot path, replace dprintk call sites with tracepoints, and
reduce the number of atomic bit operations in this path.
