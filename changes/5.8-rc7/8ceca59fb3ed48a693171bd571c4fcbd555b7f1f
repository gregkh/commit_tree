net: hns3: fix error handling for desc filling

The content of the TX desc is automatically cleared by the HW
when the HW has sent out the packet to the wire. When desc filling
fails in hns3_nic_net_xmit(), it will call hns3_clear_desc() to do
the error handling, which miss zeroing of the TX desc and the
checking if a unmapping is needed.

So add the zeroing and checking in hns3_clear_desc() to avoid the
above problem. Also add DESC_TYPE_UNKNOWN to indicate the info in
desc_cb is not valid, because hns3_nic_reclaim_desc() may treat
the desc_cb->type of zero as packet and add to the sent pkt
statistics accordingly.
