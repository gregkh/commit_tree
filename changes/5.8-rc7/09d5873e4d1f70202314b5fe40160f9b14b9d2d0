kconfig: allow only 'config', 'comment', and 'if' inside 'choice'

The code block surrounded by 'if' ... 'endif' is reduced into if_stmt,
which is accepted in the 'choice' context. Therefore, you can write any
statements within a choice block by wrapping 'if y' ... 'end'.

For example, you can create a menu inside a choice, like follows:

---------------->8----------------
  choice
          prompt "choice"

  config A
          bool "A"

  config B
          bool "B"

  if y

  menu "strange menu"

  config C
          bool "C"

  endmenu

  endif

  endchoice
---------------->8----------------

I want to change such a weird structure into a syntax error.

In fact, the USB gadget Kconfig had used nested 'choice' for no good
reason until commit df8df5e4bc37 ("usb: get rid of 'choice' for
legacy gadget drivers") killed it.

I think the 'source' inside 'choice' is on the fence. It is at least
gramatically sensible as long as the included file contains only
bool/tristate configs. However, it makes the code unreadable, and people
tend to forget the fact that the file is included from the choice
block. Commit 10e5e6c24963 ("usb: gadget: move choice ... endchoice to
legacy/Kconfig") got rid of the only usecase.

Going forward, you can only use 'config', 'comment', and 'if' inside
'choice'. This also recursively applies to 'if' blocks inside 'choice'.
