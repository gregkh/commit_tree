block: remove RQF_COPY_USER

The RQF_COPY_USER is set for bio where the passthrough request mapping
helpers decided that bounce buffering is required.  It is then used to
pad scatterlist for drivers that required it.  But given that
non-passthrough requests are per definition aligned, and directly mapped
pass-through request must be aligned it is not actually required at all.
