firmware: arm_scmi: Make mutex channel specific

In order to support multiple SMC/HVC transport channels with associated
shared memory, it is better to maintain the mutex per channel instead of
existing global one.

Move the smc_mutex into the scmi_smc structure and also rename it to
shmem_lock which is more appropriate for it's use.
