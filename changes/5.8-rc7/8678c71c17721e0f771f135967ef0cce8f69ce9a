dmaengine: fsl-edma: fix wrong tcd endianness for big-endian cpu

Due to recent fixes in m68k arch-specific I/O accessor macros, this
driver is not working anymore for ColdFire. Fix wrong tcd endianness
removing additional swaps, since edma_writex() functions should already
take care of any eventual swap if needed.

Note, i could only test the change in ColdFire mcf54415 and Vybrid
vf50 / Colibri where i don't see any issue. So, every feedback and
test for all other SoCs involved is really appreciated.
