scsi: target: Factor out a new helper, target_cmd_init_cdb()

target_setup_cmd_from_cdb() is called after a successful call to
transport_lookup_cmd_lun(). The new helper factors out the code that can be
called before the call to transport_lookup_cmd_lun(). This helper will be
used in an upcoming commit to address NULL pointer dereference.
