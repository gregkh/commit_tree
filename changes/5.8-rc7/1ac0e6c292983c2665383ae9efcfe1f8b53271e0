net: hns3: refine for unicast MAC VLAN space management

Currently, firmware helps manage the unicast MAC VLAN table
space for each PF. PF just needs to tell firmware its wanted
space when initializing, and unnecessary to free it when
un-intializing. So this patch removes the umv space free handle,
and removes the forward statement of hclge_set_umv_space()
by defining hclge_init_umv_space() after it.
