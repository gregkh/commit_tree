kcsan: Introduce scoped ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE macros

Introduce ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_*_SCOPED(), which provide an intuitive
interface to use the scoped-access feature, without having to explicitly
mark the start and end of the desired scope. Basing duration of the
checks on scope avoids accidental misuse and resulting false positives,
which may be hard to debug. See added comments for usage.

The macros are implemented using __attribute__((__cleanup__(func))),
which is supported by all compilers that currently support KCSAN.
