scsi: qla2xxx: Fix endianness annotations in header files

Annotate members of FC protocol and firmware dump data structures as big
endian. Annotate members of RISC control structures as little endian.
Annotate mailbox registers as little endian. Annotate the mb[] arrays as
CPU-endian because communication of the mb[] values with the hardware
happens through the readw() and writew() functions. readw() converts from
__le16 to u16 and writew() converts from u16 to __le16. Annotate 'handles'
as CPU-endian because for the firmware these are opaque values.
