x86/boot: Fix -Wint-to-pointer-cast build warning

Fix this warning when building 32-bit with

CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE=y
CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE=y

  arch/x86/boot/compressed/acpi.c:316:9: warning: \
    cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]

Have get_cmdline_acpi_rsdp() return unsigned long which is the proper
type to convert to a pointer of the respective width.
