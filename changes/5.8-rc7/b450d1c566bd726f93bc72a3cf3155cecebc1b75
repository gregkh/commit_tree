arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rtl8211e nodename for rk3399-nanopi4

A test with the command below gives these errors:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-nanopc-t4.dt.yaml: phy@1:
'#phy-cells' is a required property
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-nanopi-m4.dt.yaml: phy@1:
'#phy-cells' is a required property
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-nanopi-neo4.dt.yaml: phy@1:
'#phy-cells' is a required property

The rtl8211e node is used by a phy-handle.
The parent node is compatible with "snps,dwmac-mdio",
so change nodename to 'ethernet-phy', for which '#phy-cells'
is not a required property.
