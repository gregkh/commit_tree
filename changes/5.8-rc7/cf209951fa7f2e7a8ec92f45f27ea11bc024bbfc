powerpc/8xx: Map linear memory with huge pages

Map linear memory space with 512k and 8M pages whenever
possible.

Three mappings are performed:
- One for kernel text
- One for RO data
- One for the rest

Separating the mappings is done to be able to update the
protection later when using STRICT_KERNEL_RWX.

The ITLB miss handler now need to also handle huge TLBs
unless kernel text in pinned.
