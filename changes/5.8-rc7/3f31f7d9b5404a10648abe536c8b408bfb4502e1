ASoC: rt5670: Fix dac- and adc- vol-tlv values being off by a factor of 10

The adc_vol_tlv volume-control has a range from -17.625 dB to +30 dB,
not -176.25 dB to + 300 dB. This wrong scale is esp. a problem in userspace
apps which translate the dB scale to a linear scale. With the logarithmic
dB scale being of by a factor of 10 we loose all precision in the lower
area of the range when apps translate things to a linear scale.

E.g. the 0 dB default, which corresponds with a value of 47 of the
0 - 127 range for the control, would be shown as 0/100 in alsa-mixer.

Since the centi-dB values used in the TLV struct cannot represent the
0.375 dB step size used by these controls, change the TLV definition
for them to specify a min and max value instead of min + stepsize.
