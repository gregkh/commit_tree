modpost: remove mod->skip struct member

The meaning of 'skip' is obscure since it does not explain
"what to skip".

mod->skip is set when it is vmlinux or the module info came from
a dump file.

So, mod->skip is equivalent to (mod->is_vmlinux || mod->from_dump).

For the check in write_namespace_deps_files(), mod->is_vmlinux is
unneeded because the -d option is not passed in the first pass of
modpost.
