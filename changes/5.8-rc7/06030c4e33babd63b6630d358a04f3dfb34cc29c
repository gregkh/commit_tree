clk: mmp: frac: Do not lose last 4 digits of precision

While calculating the output rate of a fractional divider clock, the
value is divided and multipled by 10000, discarding the least
significant digits -- presumably to fit the intermediate value within 32
bits.

The precision we're losing is, however, not insignificant for things like
I2S clock. Maybe also elsewhere, now that since commit ea56ad60260e ("clk:
mmp2: Stop pretending PLL outputs are constant") the parent rates are more
precise and no longer rounded to 10000s.
