x86/idtentry: Provide IDTENTRY_IST

Same as IDTENTRY but for exceptions which run on Interrupt Stacks (IST) on
64bit. For 32bit this maps to IDTENTRY.

There are 3 variants which will be used:
      IDTENTRY_MCE
      IDTENTRY_DB
      IDTENTRY_NMI

These map to IDTENTRY_IST, but only the MCE and DB variants are emitting
ASM code as the NMI entry needs hand crafted ASM still.

The function defines do not contain any idtenter/exit calls as these
exceptions need special treatment.
