bpf: Selftests, add printk to test_sk_lookup_kern to encode null ptr check

Adding a printk to test_sk_lookup_kern created the reported failure
where a pointer type is checked twice for NULL. Lets add it to the
progs test test_sk_lookup_kern.c so we test the case from C all the
way into the verifier.

We already have printk's in selftests so seems OK to add another one.
