pstore/platform: Switch pstore_info::name to const

In order to more cleanly pass around backend names, make the "name" member
const. This means the module param needs to be dynamic (technically, it
was before, so this actually cleans up a minor memory leak if a backend
was specified and then gets unloaded.)
