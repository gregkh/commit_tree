sched/pelt: Sync util/runnable_sum with PELT window when propagating

update_tg_cfs_*() propagate the impact of the attach/detach of an entity
down into the cfs_rq hierarchy and must keep the sync with the current pelt
window.

Even if we can't sync child cfs_rq and its group se, we can sync the group
se and its parent cfs_rq with current position in the PELT window. In fact,
we must keep them sync in order to stay also synced with others entities
and group entities that are already attached to the cfs_rq.
