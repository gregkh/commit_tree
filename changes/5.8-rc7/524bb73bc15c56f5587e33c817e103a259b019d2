x86/fpu/xstate: Separate user and supervisor xfeatures mask

Before the introduction of XSAVES supervisor states, 'xfeatures_mask' is
used at various places to determine XSAVE buffer components and XCR0 bits.
It contains only user xstates.  To support supervisor xstates, it is
necessary to separate user and supervisor xstates:

- First, change 'xfeatures_mask' to 'xfeatures_mask_all', which represents
  the full set of bits that should ever be set in a kernel XSAVE buffer.
- Introduce xfeatures_mask_supervisor() and xfeatures_mask_user() to
  extract relevant xfeatures from xfeatures_mask_all.
