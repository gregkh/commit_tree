fs: Lift XFS_IDONTCACHE to the VFS layer

DAX effective mode (S_DAX) changes requires inode eviction.

XFS has an advisory flag (XFS_IDONTCACHE) to prevent caching of the
inode if no other additional references are taken.  We lift this flag to
the VFS layer and change the behavior slightly by allowing the flag to
remain even if multiple references are taken.

This will expedite the eviction of inodes to change S_DAX.
