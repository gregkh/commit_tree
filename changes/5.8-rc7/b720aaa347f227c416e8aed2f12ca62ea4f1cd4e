firmware: tf: Different way of L2 cache enabling after LP2 suspend

ASUS TF300T device may not work properly if firmware is asked to fully
re-initialize L2 cache after resume from LP2 suspend. The downstream
kernel of TF300T uses different opcode to enable cache after resuming
from LP2, this opcode also works fine on Nexus 7 and Ouya devices.
Supposedly, this may be needed by an older firmware versions.
