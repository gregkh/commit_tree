udp: Improve load balancing for SO_REUSEPORT.

Currently, SO_REUSEPORT does not work well if connected sockets are in a
UDP reuseport group.

Then reuseport_has_conns() returns true and the result of
reuseport_select_sock() is discarded. Also, unconnected sockets have the
same score, hence only does the first unconnected socket in udp_hslot
always receive all packets sent to unconnected sockets.

So, the result of reuseport_select_sock() should be used for load
balancing.

The noteworthy point is that the unconnected sockets placed after
connected sockets in sock_reuseport.socks will receive more packets than
others because of the algorithm in reuseport_select_sock().

    index | connected | reciprocal_scale | result
    ---------------------------------------------
    0     | no        | 20%              | 40%
    1     | no        | 20%              | 20%
    2     | yes       | 20%              | 0%
    3     | no        | 20%              | 40%
    4     | yes       | 20%              | 0%

If most of the sockets are connected, this can be a problem, but it still
works better than now.
