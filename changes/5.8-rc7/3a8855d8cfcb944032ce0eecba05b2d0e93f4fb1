MAINTAINERS: update qtnfmac maintainers

I am leaving Quantenna, so I will no longer have access to firmware and
hardware. Meanwhile I plan to participate in reviewing qtnfmac patches
for a while until my firmware knowledge becomes completely obsolete.
Adding myself as a reviewer using my personal email address.
