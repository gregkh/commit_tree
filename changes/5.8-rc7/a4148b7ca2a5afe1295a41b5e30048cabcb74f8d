KVM: VMX: Retrieve APIC access page HPA only when necessary

Move the retrieval of the HPA associated with L1's APIC access page into
VMX code to avoid unnecessarily calling gfn_to_page(), e.g. when the
vCPU is in guest mode (L2).  Alternatively, the optimization logic in
VMX could be mirrored into the common x86 code, but that will get ugly
fast when further optimizations are introduced.
