xfs: refactor log recovery item sorting into a generic dispatch structure

Create a generic dispatch structure to delegate recovery of different
log item types into various code modules.  This will enable us to move
code specific to a particular log item type out of xfs_log_recover.c and
into the log item source.

The first operation we virtualize is the log item sorting.
