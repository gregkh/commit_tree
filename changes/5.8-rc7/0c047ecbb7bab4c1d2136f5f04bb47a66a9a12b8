bpf, cgroup: Return ENOLINK for auto-detached links on update

Failure to update a bpf_link because it has been auto-detached by a dying
cgroup currently results in EINVAL error, even though the arguments passed
to bpf() syscall are not wrong.

bpf_links attaching to netns in this case will return ENOLINK, which
carries the message that the link is no longer attached to anything.

Change cgroup bpf_links to do the same to keep the uAPI errors consistent.

Fixes: 0c991ebc8c69 ("bpf: Implement bpf_prog replacement for an active bpf_cgroup_link")
