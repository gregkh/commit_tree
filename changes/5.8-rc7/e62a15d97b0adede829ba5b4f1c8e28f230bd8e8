spi: dw: Downgrade interrupt.h to irqreturn.h where appropriate

spi-dw-mid.c along with spi-dw.h are direct users of irqreturn.h
and nothing else is being used from interrupt.h. So, switch them
to use the former instead of latter one.

While here, move the header under #ifdef CONFIG_SPI_DW_MID_DMA
in spi-dw-mid.c.
