docs: mm: userfaultfd.rst: use ``foo`` for literals

Several parts of this document define literals: ioctl names,
function calls, directory patches, etc. Mark those as literal
blocks, in order to improve its readability (both at text mode
and after parsed by Sphinx.

This fixes those two warnings:

	Documentation/admin-guide/mm/userfaultfd.rst:139: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
	Documentation/admin-guide/mm/userfaultfd.rst:139: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

produced during documentation build.
