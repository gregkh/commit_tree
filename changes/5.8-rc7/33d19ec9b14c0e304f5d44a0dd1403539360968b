KVM: VMX: Introduce vmx_flush_tlb_current()

Add a helper to flush TLB entries only for the current EPTP/VPID context
and use it for the existing direct invocations of vmx_flush_tlb().  TLB
flushes that are specific to the current vCPU state do not need to flush
other contexts.

Note, both converted call sites happen to be related to the APIC access
page, this is purely coincidental.
