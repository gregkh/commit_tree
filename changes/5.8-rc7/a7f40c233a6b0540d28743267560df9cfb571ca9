USB: EHCI: ehci-mv: fix less than zero comparison of an unsigned int

The comparison of hcd->irq to less than zero for an error check will
never be true because hcd->irq is an unsigned int.  Fix this by
assigning the int retval to the return of platform_get_irq and checking
this for the -ve error condition and assigning hcd->irq to retval.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
