x86/spinlock: Remove obsolete ticket spinlock macros and types

Even though the x86 ticket spinlock code has been removed with

  cfd8983f03c7 ("x86, locking/spinlocks: Remove ticket (spin)lock implementation")

a while ago, there are still some ticket spinlock specific macros and
types left in the asm/spinlock_types.h header file that are no longer
used. Remove those as well to avoid confusion.
