USB: serial: ch341: fix lockup of devices with limited prescaler

Michael Hanselmann reports that

	[a] subset of all CH341 devices stop responding to bulk
	transfers, usually after the third byte, when the highest
	prescaler bit (0b100) is set. There is one exception, namely a
	prescaler of exactly 0b111 (fact=1, ps=3).

Fix this by forcing a lower base clock (fact = 0) whenever needed.

This specifically makes the standard rates 110, 134 and 200 bps work
again with these devices.
