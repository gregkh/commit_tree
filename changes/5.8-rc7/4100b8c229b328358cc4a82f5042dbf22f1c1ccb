iommu: Add Allwinner H6 IOMMU driver

The Allwinner H6 has introduced an IOMMU for a few DMA controllers, mostly
video related: the display engine, the video decoders / encoders, the
camera capture controller, etc.

The design is pretty simple compared to other IOMMUs found in SoCs: there's
a single instance, controlling all the masters, with a single address
space.

It also features a performance monitoring unit that allows to retrieve
various informations (per-master and global TLB accesses, hits and misses,
access latency, etc) that isn't supported at the moment.
