PCI: aardvark: Add FIXME comment for PCIE_CORE_CMD_STATUS_REG access

This register is applicable only when the controller is configured for
Endpoint mode, which is not the case for the current version of this
driver.

Attempting to remove this code though caused some ath10k cards to stop
working, so for some unknown reason it is needed here.

This should be investigated and a comment explaining this should be put
before the code, so we add a FIXME comment for now.
