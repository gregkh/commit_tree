ASoC: rt5670: Add new gpio1_is_ext_spk_en quirk and enable it on the Lenovo Miix 2 10

The Lenovo Miix 2 10 has a keyboard dock with extra speakers in the dock.
Rather then the ACL5672's GPIO1 pin being used as IRQ to the CPU, it is
actually used to enable the amplifier for these speakers
(the IRQ to the CPU comes directly from the jack-detect switch).

Add a quirk for having an ext speaker-amplifier enable pin on GPIO1
and replace the Lenovo Miix 2 10's dmi_system_id table entry's wrong
GPIO_DEV quirk (which needs to be renamed to GPIO1_IS_IRQ) with the
new RT5670_GPIO1_IS_EXT_SPK_EN quirk, so that we enable the external
speaker-amplifier as necessary.

Also update the ident field for the dmi_system_id table entry, the
Miix models are not Thinkpads.
