gpio: dwapb: Append MODULE_ALIAS for platform driver

The commit 3d2613c4289f
  ("GPIO: gpio-dwapb: Enable platform driver binding to MFD driver")
introduced a use of the platform driver but missed to add the following line
to it:
  MODULE_ALIAS("platform:gpio-dwapb");

Add this to get driver loaded automatically if platform device is registered.
