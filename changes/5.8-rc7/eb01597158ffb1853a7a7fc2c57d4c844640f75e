i2c: rcar: always clear ICSAR to avoid side effects

On R-Car Gen2, we get a timeout when reading from the address set in
ICSAR, even though the slave interface is disabled. Clearing it fixes
this situation. Note that Gen3 is not affected.

To reproduce: bind and undbind an I2C slave on some bus, run
'i2cdetect' on that bus.
