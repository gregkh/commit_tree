x86/apic: Make TSC deadline timer detection message visible

The commit

  c84cb3735fd5 ("x86/apic: Move TSC deadline timer debug printk")

removed the message which said that the deadline timer was enabled.
It added a pr_debug() message which is issued when deadline timer
validation succeeds.

Well, issued only when CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG is enabled - otherwise
pr_debug() calls get optimized away if DEBUG is not defined in the
compilation unit.

Therefore, make the above message pr_info() so that it is visible in
dmesg.
