dt-bindings: rtc: rtc-sh: Add missing power-domains property

make dtbs_check:

    arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-rskrza1.dt.yaml: rtc@fcff1000: 'power-domains' does not match any of the regexes: 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'

Fix this by documenting the missing power-domains property.
Update the example to match reality.
