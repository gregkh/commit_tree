kallsyms: Refactor kallsyms_show_value() to take cred

In order to perform future tests against the cred saved during open(),
switch kallsyms_show_value() to operate on a cred, and have all current
callers pass current_cred(). This makes it very obvious where callers
are checking the wrong credential in their "read" contexts. These will
be fixed in the coming patches.

Additionally switch return value to bool, since it is always used as a
direct permission check, not a 0-on-success, negative-on-error style
function return.
