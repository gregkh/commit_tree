Drivers: hv: vmbus: Synchronize init_vp_index() vs. CPU hotplug

init_vp_index() may access the cpu_online_mask mask via its calls of
cpumask_of_node().  Make sure to protect these accesses with a
cpus_read_lock() critical section.

Also, remove some (hardcoded) instances of CPU(0) from init_vp_index()
and replace them with VMBUS_CONNECT_CPU.  The connect CPU can not go
offline, since Hyper-V does not provide a way to change it.

Finally, order the accesses of target_cpu from init_vp_index() and
hv_synic_cleanup() by relying on the channel_mutex; this is achieved
by moving the call of init_vp_index() into vmbus_process_offer().
