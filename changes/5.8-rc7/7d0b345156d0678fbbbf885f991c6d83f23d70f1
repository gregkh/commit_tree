net: hns3: use mutex vport_lock instead of mutex umv_lock

Currently, the driver use mutex umv_lock to protect the variable
vport->share_umv_size. And there is already a mutex vport_lock
being defined in the driver, which is designed to protect the
resource of vport. So we can use vport_lock instead of umv_lock.

Furthermore, there is a time window for protect share_umv_size
between checking UMV space and doing MAC configuration in the
lin function hclge_add_uc_addr_common(). It should be extended.

This patch uses mutex vport_lock intead of spin lock umv_lock to
protect share_umv_size, and adjusts the mutex's range.
