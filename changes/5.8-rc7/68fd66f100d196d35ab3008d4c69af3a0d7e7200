KVM: x86: extend struct kvm_vcpu_pv_apf_data with token info

Currently, APF mechanism relies on the #PF abuse where the token is being
passed through CR2. If we switch to using interrupts to deliver page-ready
notifications we need a different way to pass the data. Extent the existing
'struct kvm_vcpu_pv_apf_data' with token information for page-ready
notifications.

While on it, rename 'reason' to 'flags'. This doesn't change the semantics
as we only have reasons '1' and '2' and these can be treated as bit flags
but KVM_PV_REASON_PAGE_READY is going away with interrupt based delivery
making 'reason' name misleading.

The newly introduced apf_put_user_ready() temporary puts both flags and
token information, this will be changed to put token only when we switch
to interrupt based notifications.
