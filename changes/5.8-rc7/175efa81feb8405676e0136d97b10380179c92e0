ext4: fix EXT4_MAX_LOGICAL_BLOCK macro

ext4 supports max number of logical blocks in a file to be 0xffffffff.
(This is since ext4_extent's ee_block is __le32).
This means that EXT4_MAX_LOGICAL_BLOCK should be 0xfffffffe (starting
from 0 logical offset). This patch fixes this.

The issue was seen when ext4 moved to iomap_fiemap API and when
overlayfs was mounted on top of ext4. Since overlayfs was missing
filemap_check_ranges(), so it could pass a arbitrary huge length which
lead to overflow of map.m_len logic.

This patch fixes that.
