drm/amd/display: Add DC Debug mask to disable features for bringup

[Why]
At bringup we want to be able to disable various power features.

[How]
These features are already exposed as dc_debug_options and exercised
on other OSes. Create a new dc_debug_mask module parameter and expose
relevant bits, in particular
 * DC_DISABLE_PIPE_SPLIT
 * DC_DISABLE_STUTTER
 * DC_DISABLE_DSC
 * DC_DISABLE_CLOCK_GATING
