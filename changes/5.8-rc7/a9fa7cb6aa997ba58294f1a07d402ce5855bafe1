KVM: x86: replace is_smm checks with kvm_x86_ops.smi_allowed

Do not hardcode is_smm so that all the architectural conditions for
blocking SMIs are listed in a single place.  Well, in two places because
this introduces some code duplication between Intel and AMD.

This ensures that nested SVM obeys GIF in kvm_vcpu_has_events.
