drm/i915: Differentiate between aliasing-ppgtt and ggtt pinning

Userptr causes lockdep to complain when we are using the aliasing-ppgtt
(and ggtt, but for that it is rightfully so to complain about) in that
when we revoke the userptr we take a mutex which we also use to revoke
the mmaps. However, we only revoke mmaps for GGTT bindings and we never
allow userptr to create a GGTT binding so the warning should be false
and is simply caused by our conflation of the aliasing-ppgtt with the
ggtt. So lets try treating the binding into the aliasing-ppgtt as a
separate lockclass from the ggtt. The downside is that we are
deliberately suppressing lockdep;s ability to warn us of cycles.
