scsi: target: Add missing emulate_pr attribute to passthrough backends

In commit b49d6f788530 ("scsi: target: add emulate_pr backstore attr to
toggle PR support") the new attribute emulate_pr was added.

passthrough_parse_cdb() uses the attribute's value to distinguish whether
reservation commands should be rejected or not.  But the new attribute was
not added to passthrough_attrib_attrs, so in pscsi and tcmu - the users of
passthrough_parse_cdb() - the attribute is not available to change parser's
behavior.
