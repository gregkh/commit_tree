crypto: hash - introduce crypto_shash_tfm_digest()

Currently the simplest use of the shash API is to use
crypto_shash_digest() to digest a whole buffer.  However, this still
requires allocating a hash descriptor (struct shash_desc).  Many users
don't really want to preallocate one and instead just use a one-off
descriptor on the stack like the following:

	{
		SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK(desc, tfm);
		int err;

		desc->tfm = tfm;

		err = crypto_shash_digest(desc, data, len, out);

		shash_desc_zero(desc);
	}

Wrap this in a new helper function crypto_shash_tfm_digest() that can be
used instead of the above.
