xfs: drop unused shutdown parameter from xfs_trans_ail_remove()

The shutdown parameter of xfs_trans_ail_remove() is no longer used.
The remaining callers use it for items that legitimately might not
be in the AIL or from contexts where AIL state has already been
checked. Remove the unnecessary parameter and fix up the callers.
