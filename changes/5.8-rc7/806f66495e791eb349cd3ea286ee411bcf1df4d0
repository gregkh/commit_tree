net: ks8851: Remove ks8851_rdreg32()

The ks8851_rdreg32() is used only in one place, to read two registers
using a single read. To make it easier to support 16-bit accesses via
parallel bus later on, replace this single read with two 16-bit reads
from each of the registers and drop the ks8851_rdreg32() altogether.

If this has noticeable performance impact on the SPI variant of KS8851,
then we should consider using regmap to abstract the SPI and parallel
bus options and in case of SPI, permit regmap to merge register reads
of neighboring registers into single, longer, read.
