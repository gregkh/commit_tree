hwmon: Add amd_energy driver to report energy counters

This patch adds hwmon based amd_energy driver support for
family 17h processors from AMD.

The driver provides following interface to the userspace
1. Reports the per core consumption
	* file: "energy%d_input", label: "Ecore%03d"
2. Reports per socket energy consumption
	* file: "energy%d_input", label: "Esocket%d"
3. To, increase the wrap around time of the socket energy
   counters, a 64bit accumultor is implemented.
4. Reports scaled energy value in Joules.
