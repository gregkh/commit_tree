arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: avoid using _ in node names

Many nodes in the MSM8916 device trees use '_' in node names
(especially pinctrl), even though (seemingly) '-' is preferred now.
Make this more consistent by replacing '_' with '-' where possible.

Similar naming is used for pinctrl in newer device trees (e.g. sdm845.dtsi).
