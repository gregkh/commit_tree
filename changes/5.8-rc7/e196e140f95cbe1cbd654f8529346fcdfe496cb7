drm: make various debugfs_init() functions return 0

Since commit 987d65d01356 (drm: debugfs: make
drm_debugfs_create_files() never fail), drm_debugfs_create_files() never
fails and should return void. Therefore, remove its use as the
return value of various debugfs_init() functions in drm, and have these
functions return 0 directly.

v2: convert debugfs_init() functions to return 0 instead of void to
avoid build breakage.
