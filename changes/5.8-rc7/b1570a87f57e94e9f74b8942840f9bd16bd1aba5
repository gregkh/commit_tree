net/smc: final part of add link processing as SMC client

This patch finalizes the ADD_LINK processing of new links. Receive the
CONFIRM_LINK request from peer, complete the link initialization,
register all used buffers with the IB device and finally send the
CONFIRM_LINK response, which completes the ADD_LINK processing.
And activate smc_llc_cli_add_link() in af_smc.c.
