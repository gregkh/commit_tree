s390/qdio: simplify overlap calculation on Input refill

Refilling the Input Queue requires additional checks, as the refilled
SBALs can overlap with the ACKs that qdio maintains on the queue.

This code path is way too complex, and does a whole bunch of wrap-around
checks that the modulo arithmetic in sub_buf() takes care of by itself.
So shrink down all that code into a few lines of equivalent
functionality.
