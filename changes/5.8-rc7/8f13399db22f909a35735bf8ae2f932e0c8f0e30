sctp: shrink stream outq only when new outcnt < old outcnt

It's not necessary to go list_for_each for outq->out_chunk_list
when new outcnt >= old outcnt, as no chunk with higher sid than
new (outcnt - 1) exists in the outqueue.

While at it, also move the list_for_each code in a new function
sctp_stream_shrink_out(), which will be used in the next patch.
