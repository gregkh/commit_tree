pstore/zone: Provide way to skip "broken" zone for MTD devices

One requirement to support MTD devices in pstore/zone is having a
way to declare certain regions as broken. Add this support to
pstore/zone.

The MTD driver should return -ENOMSG when encountering a bad region,
which tells pstore/zone to skip and try the next one.
