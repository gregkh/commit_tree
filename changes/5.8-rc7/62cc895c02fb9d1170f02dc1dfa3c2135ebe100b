drm/amdgpu: off by one in amdgpu_device_attr_create_groups() error handling

This loop in the error handling code should start a "i - 1" and end at
"i == 0".  Currently it starts a "i" and ends at "i == 1".  The result
is that it removes one attribute that wasn't created yet, and leaks the
zeroeth attribute.
