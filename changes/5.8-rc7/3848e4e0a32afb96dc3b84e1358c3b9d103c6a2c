xen/xenbus: avoid large structs and arrays on the stack

xenbus_map_ring_valloc() and its sub-functions are putting quite large
structs and arrays on the stack. This is problematic at runtime, but
might also result in build failures (e.g. with clang due to the option
-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=... used).

Fix that by moving most of the data from the stack into a dynamically
allocated struct. Performance is no issue here, as
xenbus_map_ring_valloc() is used only when adding a new PV device to
a backend driver.

While at it move some duplicated code from pv/hvm specific mapping
functions to the single caller.
