ovl: resolve more conflicting mount options

Similar to the way that a conflict between metacopy=on,redirect_dir=off is
resolved, also resolve conflicts between nfs_export=on,index=off and
nfs_export=on,metacopy=on.

An explicit mount option wins over a default config value.  Both explicit
mount options result in an error.

Without this change the xfstests group overlay/exportfs are skipped if
metacopy is enabled by default.
