floppy: cleanup: do not iterate on current_fdc in do_floppy_init()

There's no need to iterate on current_fdc in do_floppy_init() anymore,
in the first case it's only used as an array index to access fdc_state[],
so let's get rid of this confusing assignment. The second case is a bit
trickier because user_reset_fdc() needs to already know current_fdc when
called with drive==-1 due to this call chain:

    user_reset_fdc()
      lock_fdc()
        set_fdc()
           drive<0 ==> new_fdc = current_fdc

Note that current_drive is not used in this code part and may even not
match a unit belonging to current_fdc. Instead of passing -1 we can
simply pass the first drive of the FDC being initialized, which is even
cleaner as it will allow the function chain above to consistently assign
both variables.
