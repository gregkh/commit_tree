scsi: ufs: Allow WriteBooster on UFS 2.2 devices

According to the UFS specification, WriteBooster is officially supported by
UFS 2.2.

Since UFS 2.2 specification has been finalized in JEDEC and such devices
have also showed up in the market, modify the checking rule for
ufshcd_wb_probe() to allow these devices to enable WriteBooster.
