AX.25: Fix out-of-bounds read in ax25_connect()

Checks on `addr_len` and `fsa->fsa_ax25.sax25_ndigis` are insufficient.
ax25_connect() can go out of bounds when `fsa->fsa_ax25.sax25_ndigis`
equals to 7 or 8. Fix it.

This issue has been reported as a KMSAN uninit-value bug, because in such
a case, ax25_connect() reaches into the uninitialized portion of the
`struct sockaddr_storage` statically allocated in __sys_connect().

It is safe to remove `fsa->fsa_ax25.sax25_ndigis > AX25_MAX_DIGIS` because
`addr_len` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to
`sizeof(struct full_sockaddr_ax25)`.
