net: bpf: Add netlink and ipv6_route bpf_iter targets

This patch added netlink and ipv6_route targets, using
the same seq_ops (except show() and minor changes for stop())
for /proc/net/{netlink,ipv6_route}.

The net namespace for these targets are the current net
namespace at file open stage, similar to
/proc/net/{netlink,ipv6_route} reference counting
the net namespace at seq_file open stage.

Since module is not supported for now, ipv6_route is
supported only if the IPV6 is built-in, i.e., not compiled
as a module. The restriction can be lifted once module
is properly supported for bpf_iter.
