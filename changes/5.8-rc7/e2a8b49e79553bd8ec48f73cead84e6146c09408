powerpc/uaccess: Don't use "m<>" constraint

The "m<>" constraint breaks compilation with GCC 4.6.x era compilers.

The use of the constraint allows the compiler to use update-form
instructions, however in practice current compilers never generate
those forms for any of the current uses of __put_user_asm_goto().

We anticipate that GCC 4.6 will be declared unsupported for building
the kernel in the not too distant future. So for now just switch to
the "m" constraint.
