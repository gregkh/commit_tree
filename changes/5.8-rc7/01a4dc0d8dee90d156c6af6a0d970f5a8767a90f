sh: sh4a: Bring back tmu3_device early device

Commit 1399c195ef50 ("sh: Switch to new style TMU device") converted
tmu3_device platform device to new style of platform data but removed it
from sh7786_early_devices array effectively removing last three timers
and causing a warning:

    arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh4a/setup-sh7786.c:243:31:
        warning: ‘tmu3_device’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
