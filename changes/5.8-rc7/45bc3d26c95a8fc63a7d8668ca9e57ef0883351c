drm: rework SET_MASTER and DROP_MASTER perm handling

This commit reworks the permission handling of the two ioctls. In
particular it enforced the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check only, if:
 - we're issuing the ioctl from process other than the one which opened
the node, and
 - we are, or were master in the past

This ensures that we:
 - do not regress the systemd-logind style of DRM_MASTER arbitrator
 - allow applications which do not use systemd-logind to drop their
master capabilities (and regain them at later point) ... w/o running as
root.

See the comment above drm_master_check_perm() for more details.

v1:
 - Tweak wording, fixup all checks, add igt test

v2:
 - Add a few more comments, grammar nitpicks.
