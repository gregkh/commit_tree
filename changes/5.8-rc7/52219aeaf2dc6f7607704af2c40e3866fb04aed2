mm/memory_hotplug: handle memblocks only with CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK

The comment in add_memory_resource() is stale: hotadd_new_pgdat() will no
longer call get_pfn_range_for_nid(), as a hotadded pgdat will simply span
no pages at all, until memory is moved to the zone/node via
move_pfn_range_to_zone() - e.g., when onlining memory blocks.

The only archs that care about memblocks for hotplugged memory (either for
iterating over all system RAM or testing for memory validity) are arm64,
s390x, and powerpc - due to CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK.  Without
CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK, we can simply stop messing with memblocks.
