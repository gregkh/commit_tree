perf parse-events: Add parse_events_option() variant that creates evlist

For the upcoming --switch-output-event option we want to create the side
band event, populate it with the specified events and then, if it is
present multiple times, go on adding to it, then, if the BPF tracking is
required, use the first event to set its attr.bpf_event to get those
PERF_RECORD_BPF_EVENT metadata events too.
