staging: rtl8188eu: remove unnecessary variable

The variable 'bStopBlinking' is used in if tests immediately after its
value is set. Use the conditions for setting 'bStopBlinking' diretly in
the subsequent if tests and remove the variable. Slightly reduces
object file size by 16 bytes (gcc 9.2.1 x86_64).
