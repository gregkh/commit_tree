x86/fpu: Reset MXCSR to default in kernel_fpu_begin()

Previously, kernel floating point code would run with the MXCSR control
register value last set by userland code by the thread that was active
on the CPU core just before kernel call. This could affect calculation
results if rounding mode was changed, or a crash if a FPU/SIMD exception
was unmasked.

Restore MXCSR to the kernel's default value.

 [ bp: Carve out from a bigger patch by Petteri, add feature check, add
   FNINIT call too (amluto). ]
