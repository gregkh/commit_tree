ice: Refactor Rx checksum checks

We don't need both rx_status and rx_error parameters, as the latter is
a subset of the former. Remove rx_error completely and check the right bit
in rx_status.

Rename rx_status to rx_status0, and rx_status_err1 to
rx_status1. This naming more closely reflects the specification.
