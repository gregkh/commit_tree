samples, bpf: Refactor tail call user progs with libbpf

BPF tail call uses the BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY type map for calling
into other BPF programs and this PROG_ARRAY should be filled prior to
use. Currently, samples with the PROG_ARRAY type MAP fill this program
array with bpf_load. For bpf_load to fill this map, kernel BPF program
must specify the section with specific format of <prog_type>/<array_idx>
(e.g. SEC("socket/0"))

But by using libbpf instead of bpf_load, user program can specify which
programs should be added to PROG_ARRAY. The advantage of this approach
is that you can selectively add only the programs you want, rather than
adding all of them to PROG_ARRAY, and it's much more intuitive than the
traditional approach.

This commit refactors user programs with the PROG_ARRAY type MAP with
libbpf instead of using bpf_load.
