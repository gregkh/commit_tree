arm64: ptrace: Use NO_SYSCALL instead of -1 in syscall_trace_enter()

Setting a system call number of -1 is special, as it indicates that the
current system call should be skipped.

Use NO_SYSCALL instead of -1 when checking for this scenario, which is
different from the -1 returned due to a seccomp failure.
