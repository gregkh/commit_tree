dma-buf: Report signaled links inside dma-fence-chain

Whenever we walk along the dma-fence-chain, we prune signaled links to
keep the chain nice and tidy. This leads to situations where we can
prune a link and report the earlier fence as the target seqno --
violating our own consistency checks that the seqno is not more advanced
than the last element in a dma-fence-chain.

Report a NULL fence and success if the seqno has already been signaled.
