net/mlx5e: Offload flow rules to active lower representor

When a bond device is created over one or more non uplink representors,
and when a flow rule is offloaded to such bond device, offload a rule
to the active lower device.

Assuming that this is active-backup lag, the rules should be offloaded
to the active lower device which is the representor of the direct
path (not the failover).
