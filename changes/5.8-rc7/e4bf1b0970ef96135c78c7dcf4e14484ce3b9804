mmc: host: meson-mx-sdhc: new driver for the Amlogic Meson SDHC host

The SDHC MMC host controller on Amlogic SoCs provides an eMMC and MMC
card interface with 1/4/8-bit bus width.
It supports eMMC spec 4.4x/4.5x including HS200 (up to 100MHz clock).

The public S805 datasheet [0] contains a short documentation about the
registers. Unfortunately it does not describe how to use the registers
to make the hardware work. Thus this driver is based on reading (and
understanding) the Amlogic 3.10 GPL kernel code.

Some hardware details are not easy to see. Jianxin Pan was kind enough
to answer my questions:
The hardware has built-in busy timeout support. The maximum timeout is
30 seconds. This is only documented in Amlogic's internal
documentation.

The controller only works with very specific clock configurations. The
details are not part of the public datasheet. In my own words the
supported configurations are:
- 399.812kHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 2126 sd_rx_phase = 63
- 1MHz:		clkin =  850MHz div = 850  sd_rx_phase = 55
- 5.986MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 142  sd_rx_phase = 24
- 25MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 34   sd_rx_phase = 15
- 47.222MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 18   sd_rx_phase = 11/15 (SDR50/HS)
- 53.125MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 16   sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 70.833MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 12   sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 85MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 10   sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 94.44MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 9    sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 106.25MHz:	clkin =  850MHz div = 8    sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 127.5MHz:     clkin = 1275MHz div = 10   sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 141.667MHz:   clkin =  850MHz div = 6    sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 159.375MHz:	clkin = 1275MHz div = 8    sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- 212.5MHz:	clkin = 1275MHz div = 6    sd_rx_phase = (tuning)
- (sd_tx_phase is always 1, 94.44MHz is not listed in the datasheet
   but this is what the 3.10 BSP kernel on Odroid-C1 actually uses)

NOTE: CMD23 support is disabled for now because it results in command
timeouts and thus decreases read performance.
