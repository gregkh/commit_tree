powerpc/optprobes: Add register argument to patch_imm64_load_insns()

Currently patch_imm32_load_insns() is used to load an instruction to
r4 to be emulated by emulate_step(). For prefixed instructions we
would like to be able to load a 64bit immediate to r4. To prepare for
this make patch_imm64_load_insns() take an argument that decides which
register to load an immediate to - rather than hardcoding r3.
