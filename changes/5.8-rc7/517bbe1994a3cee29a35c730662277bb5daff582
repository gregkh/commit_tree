bpf: Enforce BPF ringbuf size to be the power of 2

BPF ringbuf assumes the size to be a multiple of page size and the power of
2 value. The latter is important to avoid division while calculating position
inside the ring buffer and using (N-1) mask instead. This patch fixes omission
to enforce power-of-2 size rule.
