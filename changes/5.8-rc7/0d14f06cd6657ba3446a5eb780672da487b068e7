PCI: Avoid FLR for AMD Matisse HD Audio & USB 3.0

The AMD Matisse HD Audio & USB 3.0 devices advertise Function Level Reset
support, but hang when an FLR is triggered.

To reproduce the problem, attach the device to a VM, then detach and try to
attach again.

Rename the existing quirk_intel_no_flr(), which was not Intel-specific, to
quirk_no_flr(), and apply it to prevent the use of FLR on these AMD
devices.
