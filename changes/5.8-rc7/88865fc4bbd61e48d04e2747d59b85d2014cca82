ice: Fix casting issues

Change min() macros to min_t() which has compare type specified and it
helps avoid precision loss.

In some cases there was precision loss during calls or assignments.
Some fields in structs were unnecessarily large and gave multiple
warnings.

There were also some minor type differences which are now fixed as well as
some cases where a simple cast was needed.

Callers were were passing data that is a u16 to
ice_sched_cfg_node_bw_alloc() but the function was truncating that to a u8.
Fix that by changing the function to take a u16.
