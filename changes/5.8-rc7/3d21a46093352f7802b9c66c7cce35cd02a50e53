dt-bindings: Remove cases of 'allOf' containing a '$ref'

json-schema versions draft7 and earlier have a weird behavior in that
any keywords combined with a '$ref' are ignored (silently). The correct
form was to put a '$ref' under an 'allOf'. This behavior is now changed
in the 2019-09 json-schema spec and '$ref' can be mixed with other
keywords. The json-schema library doesn't yet support this, but the
tooling now does a fixup for this and either way works.

This has been a constant source of review comments, so let's change this
treewide so everyone copies the simpler syntax.

Scripted with ruamel.yaml with some manual fixups. Some minor whitespace
changes from the script.
