KVM: arm64: Remove host_cpu_context member from vcpu structure

For very long, we have kept this pointer back to the per-cpu
host state, despite having working per-cpu accessors at EL2
for some time now.

Recent investigations have shown that this pointer is easy
to abuse in preemptible context, which is a sure sign that
it would better be gone. Not to mention that a per-cpu
pointer is faster to access at all times.
