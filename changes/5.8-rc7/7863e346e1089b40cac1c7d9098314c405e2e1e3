KVM: async_pf: Cleanup kvm_setup_async_pf()

schedule_work() returns 'false' only when the work is already on the queue
and this can't happen as kvm_setup_async_pf() always allocates a new one.
Also, to avoid potential race, it makes sense to to schedule_work() at the
very end after we've added it to the queue.

While on it, do some minor cleanup. gfn_to_pfn_async() mentioned in a
comment does not currently exist and, moreover, we can check
kvm_is_error_hva() at the very beginning, before we try to allocate work so
'retry_sync' label can go away completely.
