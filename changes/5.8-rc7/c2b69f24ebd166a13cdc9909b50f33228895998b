flow_offload: Move rhashtable inclusion to the source file

I noticed that touching linux/rhashtable.h causes lib/vsprintf.c to
be rebuilt.  This dependency came through a bogus inclusion in the
file net/flow_offload.h.  This patch moves it to the right place.

This patch also removes a lingering rhashtable inclusion in cls_api
created by the same commit.
