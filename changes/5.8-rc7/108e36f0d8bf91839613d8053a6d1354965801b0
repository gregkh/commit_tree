scsi: scsi_debug: Disallow zone sizes that are not powers of 2

Allowing a non-power-of-2 zone size forces the use of direct division
operations of 64-bit sector values to obtain a zone number or number of
zones. Doing so without using do_div() leads to compilation errors on
32-bit architectures.

Devices with a zone size that is not a power of 2 do not exist today so
allowing their emulation is of limited interest as the sd driver will not
support them anyway. To fix this compilation error, instead of using
do_div() for sector values divisions, simply disallow zone size values that
are not a power of 2.
