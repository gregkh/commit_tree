pinctrl: ingenic: Add irq_{request,release}_resources callbacks

These are called when a GPIO is to be used as IRQ.

Without these custom callbacks, when an interrupt is requested directly
and not through gpiod_to_irq(), the request fails because the GPIO is
not necesarily in input mode. These callbacks simply enforce that the
requested GPIO is in input mode.
