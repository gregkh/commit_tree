drm/amd/display: Mode change with same timing causing long display blank

[Why]
What a mode change is requested for the same timing a full stream reset
can occur in some cases which causes monitor to blank for a few seconds.

[How]
Do not consider infoframe updates as needing a full stream reset as they
will be handled on the first flip after a modeset when surface
information is available.
