powerpc/8xx: use pmd_off() to access a PMD entry in pte_update()

The pte_update() implementation for PPC_8xx unfolds page table from the PGD
level to access a PMD entry. Since 8xx has only 2-level page table this can
be simplified with pmd_off() shortcut.

Replace explicit unfolding with pmd_off() and drop defines of pgd_index()
and pgd_offset() that are no longer needed.
