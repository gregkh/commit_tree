iio: light: cm32181: Add some extra register defines

These come from a newer version of cm32181.c, which is floating around
the net, with a copyright of:

 * Copyright (C) 2014 Capella Microsystems Inc.

Note that this removes the bogus CM32181_CMD_ALS_ENABLE define, there
is no enable bit, only a disable bit and enabled is the absence of
being disabled.

This is a preparation patch for adding support for the older
CM3218 model of the light sensor.
