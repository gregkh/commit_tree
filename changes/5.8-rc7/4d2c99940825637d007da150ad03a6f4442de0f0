net: tg3: tidy up loop, remove need to compute off with a multiply

Currently the value for 'off' is computed using a multiplication and
a couple of statements later off is being incremented by len and
this value is never read.  Clean up the code by removing the
multiplication and just increment off by len on each iteration.
