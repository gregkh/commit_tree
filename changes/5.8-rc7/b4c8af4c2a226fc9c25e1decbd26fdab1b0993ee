hwmon: (pmbus) Fix page vs. register when accessing fans

Commit 16358542f32f ("hwmon: (pmbus) Implement multi-phase support")
added support for multi-phase pmbus devices. However, when calling
pmbus_add_sensor() for fans, the patch swapped the `page` and `reg`
attributes. As a result, the fan speeds were reported as 0 RPM on my device.
