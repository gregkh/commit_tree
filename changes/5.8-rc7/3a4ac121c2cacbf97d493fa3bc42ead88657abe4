x86/perf: Add hardware performance events support for Zhaoxin CPU.

Zhaoxin CPU has provided facilities for monitoring performance
via PMU (Performance Monitor Unit), but the functionality is unused so far.
Therefore, add support for zhaoxin pmu to make performance related
hardware events available.

The PMU is mostly an Intel Architectural PerfMon-v2 with a novel
errata for the ZXC line. It supports the following events:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
