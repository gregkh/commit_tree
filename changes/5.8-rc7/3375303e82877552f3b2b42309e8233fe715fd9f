iommu/vt-d: Add custom allocator for IOASID

When VT-d driver runs in the guest, PASID allocation must be
performed via virtual command interface. This patch registers a
custom IOASID allocator which takes precedence over the default
XArray based allocator. The resulting IOASID allocation will always
come from the host. This ensures that PASID namespace is system-
wide.

Virtual command registers are used in the guest only, to prevent
vmexit cost, we cache the capability and store it during initialization.
