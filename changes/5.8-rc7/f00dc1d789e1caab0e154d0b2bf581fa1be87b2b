staging: wfx: poll IRQ during init

When the chip starts in SDIO mode, the external IRQ (aka Out-Of-Band
IRQ) cannot be used before to configure it. Therefore, the first
exchanges with the chip have to be done without the OOB IRQ.

This patch allow to poll the data until the OOB IRQ is correctly setup.
In order to keep the code simpler, this patch also poll data even if OOB
IRQ is not used.
