sched: Clean up scheduler_ipi()

The scheduler IPI has grown weird and wonderful over the years, time
for spring cleaning.

Move all the non-trivial stuff out of it and into a regular smp function
call IPI. This then reduces the schedule_ipi() to most of it's former NOP
glory and ensures to keep the interrupt vector lean and mean.

Aside of that avoiding the full irq_enter() in the x86 IPI implementation
is incorrect as scheduler_ipi() can be instrumented. To work around that
scheduler_ipi() had an irq_enter/exit() hack when heavy work was
pending. This is gone now.
