habanalabs: remove stop-on-error flag from DMA

Stop-on-error mode in DMA is useful as it stops the transaction
immediately upon error e.g. page fault.
But it may cause the next command submission to fail as is leaves the DMA
in unstable state.
Therefore we remove the stop-on-error configuration from the DMA.
Stop-on-err is still available for debug.
