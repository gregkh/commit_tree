x86/boot/build: Make 'make bzlilo' not depend on vmlinux or $(obj)/bzImage

bzlilo is an installation target because it copies files to
$(INSTALL_PATH)/, then runs 'lilo'. However, arch/x86/Makefile and
arch/x86/boot/Makefile have it depend on vmlinux and $(obj)/bzImage,
respectively.

'make bzlilo' may update some build artifacts in the source tree.

As commit

  19514fc665ff ("arm, kbuild: make "make install" not depend on vmlinux")

explained, this should not happen.

Make 'bzlilo' not depend on any build artifact.
