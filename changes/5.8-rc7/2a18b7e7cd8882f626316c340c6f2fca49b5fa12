KVM: async_pf: Inject 'page ready' event only if 'page not present' was previously injected

'Page not present' event may or may not get injected depending on
guest's state. If the event wasn't injected, there is no need to
inject the corresponding 'page ready' event as the guest may get
confused. E.g. Linux thinks that the corresponding 'page not present'
event wasn't delivered *yet* and allocates a 'dummy entry' for it.
This entry is never freed.

Note, 'wakeup all' events have no corresponding 'page not present'
event and always get injected.

s390 seems to always be able to inject 'page not present', the
change is effectively a nop.
