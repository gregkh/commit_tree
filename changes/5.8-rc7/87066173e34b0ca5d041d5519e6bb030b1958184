staging: wfx: fix overflow in frame counters

It has been reported that trying to send small packets of data could
produce a "inconsistent notification" warning.

It seems that in some circumstances, the number of frame queued in the
driver could greatly increase and exceed UCHAR_MAX. So the field
"buffered" from struct sta_priv can overflow.

Just increase the size of "bueffered" to fix the problem.
