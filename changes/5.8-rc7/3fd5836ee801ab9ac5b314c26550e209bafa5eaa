powerpc: Add support for ISA v3.1

Newer ISA versions are enabled by clearing all bits in the PCR
associated with previous versions of the ISA. Enable ISA v3.1 support
by updating the PCR mask to include ISA v3.0. This ensures all PCR
bits corresponding to earlier architecture versions get cleared
thereby enabling ISA v3.1 if supported by the hardware.
