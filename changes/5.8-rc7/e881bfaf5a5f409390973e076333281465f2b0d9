KVM: PPC: Fix nested guest RC bits update

Before commit 6cdf30375f82 ("powerpc/kvm/book3s: Use kvm helpers
to walk shadow or secondary table") we called __find_linux_pte() with
a page table pointer from a kvm_nested_guest struct but
now we rely on kvmhv_find_nested() which takes an L1 LPID and returns
a kvm_nested_guest pointer, however we pass a L0 LPID there and
the L2 guest hangs.

This fixes the LPID passed to kvmppc_hv_handle_set_rc().
