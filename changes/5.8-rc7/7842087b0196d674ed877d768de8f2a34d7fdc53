Input: mms114 - add extra compatible for mms345l

MMS345L is another first generation touch screen from Melfas,
which uses mostly the same registers as MMS152.

However, there is some garbage printed during initialization.
Apparently MMS345L does not have the MMS152_COMPAT_GROUP register
that is read+printed during initialization.

  TSP FW Rev: bootloader 0x6 / core 0x26 / config 0x26, Compat group: \x06

On earlier kernel versions the compat group was actually printed as
an ASCII control character, seems like it gets escaped now.

But we probably shouldn't print something from a random register.

Add a separate "melfas,mms345l" compatible that avoids reading
from the MMS152_COMPAT_GROUP register. This might also help in case
there is some other device-specific quirk in the future.
