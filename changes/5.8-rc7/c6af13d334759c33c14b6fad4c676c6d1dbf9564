timer: add fsleep for flexible sleeping

Sleeping for a certain amount of time requires use of different
functions, depending on the time period.
Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst explains when to use which
function, and also checkpatch checks for some potentially
problematic cases.

So let's create a helper that automatically chooses the appropriate
sleep function -> fsleep(), for flexible sleeping

If the delay is a constant, then the compiler should be able to ensure
that the new helper doesn't create overhead. If the delay is not
constant, then the new helper can save some code.
