net: phy: bcm54140: fix less than zero comparison on an unsigned

Currently the unsigned variable tmp is being checked for an negative
error return from the call to bcm_phy_read_rdb and this can never
be true since tmp is unsigned.  Fix this by making tmp a plain int.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
