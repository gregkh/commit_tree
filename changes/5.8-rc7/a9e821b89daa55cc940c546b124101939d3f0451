arm64: Add KRYO4XX gold CPU cores to erratum list 1463225 and 1418040

KRYO4XX gold/big CPU core revisions r0p0 to r3p1 are affected by
erratum 1463225 and 1418040, so add them to the respective list.
The variant and revision bits are implementation defined and are
different from the their Cortex CPU counterparts on which they are
based on, i.e., (r0p0 to r3p1) is equivalent to (rcpe to rfpf).
