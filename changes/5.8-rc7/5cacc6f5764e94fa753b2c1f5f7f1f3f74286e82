ASoC: rt5670: Correct RT5670_LDO_SEL_MASK

The RT5670_PWR_ANLG1 register has 3 bits to select the LDO voltage,
so the correct mask is 0x7 not 0x3.

Because of this wrong mask we were programming the ldo bits
to a setting of binary 001 (0x05 & 0x03) instead of binary 101
when moving to SND_SOC_BIAS_PREPARE.

According to the datasheet 001 is a reserved value, so no idea
what it did, since the driver was working fine before I guess we
got lucky and it does something which is ok.
