scsi: core: doc: Change function comments to kernel-doc style

Despite of functions being documented, they are not in the kernel-doc
specification, and could not be included in kernel documentation. Change
the style of functions comments to be compliant to the kernel-doc style.
When the function comments are outdated, update then.

[mkp: a few edits]
