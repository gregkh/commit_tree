kcov: use t->kcov_mode as enabled indicator

Currently kcov_remote_start() and kcov_remote_stop() check t->kcov to find
out whether the coverage is already being collected by the current task.
Use t->kcov_mode for that instead.  This doesn't change the overall
behavior in any way, but serves as a preparation for the following softirq
coverage collection support patch.
