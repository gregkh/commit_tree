drm/sti: remove use of drm_debugfs functions as return values

Since commit 987d65d01356 (drm: debugfs: make
drm_debugfs_create_files() never fail), drm_debugfs_create_files() never
fails, and should return void. This change therefore removes it uses as
a return value in various functions across drm/sti.

With these changes, the affected functions have been changed to use a void
return value.

v2: convert sti_mixer_debugfs_init() and sti_compositor_debugfs_init()
to return void too. Also have sti_drm_dbg_init() to return 0 to avoid
build issues.
