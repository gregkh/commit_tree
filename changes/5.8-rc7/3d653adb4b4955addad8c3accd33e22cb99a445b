net: bcmgenet: test RBUF_ACPI_EN when resuming

When the GENET driver resumes from deep sleep the UMAC_CMD
register may not be accessible and therefore should not be
accessed from bcmgenet_wol_power_up_cfg() if the GENET has
been reset.

This commit adds a check of the RBUF_ACPI_EN flag when Wake
on Filter is enabled. A clear flag indicates that the GENET
hardware must have been reset so the remainder of the
hardware programming is bypassed.
