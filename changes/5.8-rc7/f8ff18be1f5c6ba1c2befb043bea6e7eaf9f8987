tools lib traceevent: Take care of return value of asprintf

According to the API, if memory allocation wasn't possible, or some
other error occurs, asprintf will return -1, and the contents of strp
below are undefined.

  int asprintf(char **strp, const char *fmt, ...);

This patch takes care of return value of asprintf to make it less error
prone and prevent the following build warning.

  ignoring return value of ‘asprintf’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]
