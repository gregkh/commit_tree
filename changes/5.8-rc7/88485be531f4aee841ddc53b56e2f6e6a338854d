scs: Move scs_overflow_check() out of architecture code

There is nothing architecture-specific about scs_overflow_check() as
it's just a trivial wrapper around scs_corrupted().

For parity with task_stack_end_corrupted(), rename scs_corrupted() to
task_scs_end_corrupted() and call it from schedule_debug() when
CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK_is enabled, which better reflects its
purpose as a debug feature to catch inadvertent overflow of the SCS.
Finally, remove the unused scs_overflow_check() function entirely.

This has absolutely no impact on architectures that do not support SCS
(currently arm64 only).
