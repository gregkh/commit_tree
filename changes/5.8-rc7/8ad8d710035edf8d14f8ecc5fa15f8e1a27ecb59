ext4: rework map struct instantiation in ext4_ext_map_blocks()

The path performing block allocations in ext4_ext_map_blocks() contains
code trimming the length of a new extent that is repeated later
in the function.  This code is both redundant and unnecessary as the
exact length of the new extent has already been calculated.  Rewrite the
instantiation of the map struct in this case to use the available
values, avoiding the overhead of unnecessary conversions and improving
clarity.  Add another map struct instantiation tailored specifically to
the separate case for an existing written extent.  Remove an old comment
that no longer appears applicable to the current code.
