net: qede: add hw err scheduled handler

qede (ethernet level driver) registers a callback handler.
This handler maintains eth dev state flags/bits to track error processing.

It implements in place processing part for nonsleeping context (WARN_ON
trigger), and a deferred (delayed work) part which triggers recovery
process for recoverable errors.

In later patches this atomic handler will come with more meat.

We introduce err_flags on ethdevice structure, its being used to record
error handling properties.
