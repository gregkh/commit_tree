staging: wfx: repair wfx_flush()

Until now, wfx_flush() flushed queue for while device instead of only
the queue of the intended vif. It sometime failed with a timeout, but
this error was not reported.

Moreover, if the device was frozen, wfx_flush didn't do anything and it
results a potential warning (and maybe a resource leak) when the frozen
device was unregistered.

We can also notice that wfx_tx_queues_wait_empty_vif() did only exist to
work around the broken feature of wfx_flush().

This patch repair wfx_flush() and therefore drop
wfx_tx_queues_wait_empty_vif().
