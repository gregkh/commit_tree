i2c: at91: Send bus clear command if SDA is down

After a transfer timeout, some faulty I2C slave devices might hold down
the SDA pin. We can generate a bus clear command, hoping that the slave
might release the pins.
If the CLEAR command is not supported, we will use gpio recovery, if
available, to reset the bus.
