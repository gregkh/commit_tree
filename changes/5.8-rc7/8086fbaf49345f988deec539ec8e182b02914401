bpf: Allow any port in bpf_bind helper

We want to have a tighter control on what ports we bind to in
the BPF_CGROUP_INET{4,6}_CONNECT hooks even if it means
connect() becomes slightly more expensive. The expensive part
comes from the fact that we now need to call inet_csk_get_port()
that verifies that the port is not used and allocates an entry
in the hash table for it.

Since we can't rely on "snum || !bind_address_no_port" to prevent
us from calling POST_BIND hook anymore, let's add another bind flag
to indicate that the call site is BPF program.

v5:
* fix wrong AF_INET (should be AF_INET6) in the bpf program for v6

v3:
* More bpf_bind documentation refinements (Martin KaFai Lau)
* Add UDP tests as well (Martin KaFai Lau)
* Don't start the thread, just do socket+bind+listen (Martin KaFai Lau)

v2:
* Update documentation (Andrey Ignatov)
* Pass BIND_FORCE_ADDRESS_NO_PORT conditionally (Andrey Ignatov)
