ALSA: hda/realtek - Add LED class support for micmute LED

Currently DMIC controls micmute LED via "audio mute LED trigger".

However, unlike Dell and Lenovo platforms, HP platforms don't provide a
way to control micmute LED via ACPI, it's controlled by HDA codec
instead.

So let's register an LED class for micmute so other subsystems like DMIC
can facilitate the codec-controlled LED.
