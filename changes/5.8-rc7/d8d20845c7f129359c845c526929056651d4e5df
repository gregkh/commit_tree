ath9k: add calibration timeout for AR9002

ADC & I/Q calibrations could take infinite time to comple, since they
depend on received frames. In particular the I/Q mismatch calibration
requires receiving of OFDM frames for completion. But in the 2.4GHz
band, a station could receive only CCK frames for a very long time.

And while we wait for the completion of one of the mentioned
calibrations, the NF calibration is blocked. Moreover, in some
environments, I/Q calibration is unable to complete until a correct
noise calibration will be performed due to AGC behaviour.

In order to avoid delaying NF calibration on forever, limit the maximum
duration of ADCs & I/Q calibrations. If the calibration is not completed
within the maximum time, it will be interrupted and a next calibration
will be performed. The code that selects the next calibration has been
reworked to the loop so incompleted calibration will be respinned later.

Ð maximum calibration time of 30 seconds was selected to give the
calibration enough time to complete and to not interfere with the long
(NF) calibration.

Run tested with AR9220.
