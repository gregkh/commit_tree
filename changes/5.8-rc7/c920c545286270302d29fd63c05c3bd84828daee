s390/qdio: warn about unexpected SLSB states

The way we produce SBALs to the device (first update q->nr_buf_used,
then update the SLSB) should ensure that we never see some of the
SLSB states when scanning the queue for progress.
So make some noise if we do, this implies a bug in our SBAL tracking.

Also tweak the WARN msg to provide more information.
