ACPI: GED: use correct trigger type field in _Exx / _Lxx handling

Commit ea6f3af4c5e63f69 ("ACPI: GED: add support for _Exx / _Lxx handler
methods") added a reference to the 'triggering' field of either the
normal or the extended ACPI IRQ resource struct, but inadvertently used
the wrong pointer in the latter case. Note that both pointers refer to the
same union, and the 'triggering' field appears at the same offset in both
struct types, so it currently happens to work by accident. But let's fix
it nonetheless
