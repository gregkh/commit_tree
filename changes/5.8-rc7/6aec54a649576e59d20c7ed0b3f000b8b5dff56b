arm64: vexpress: Don't select CONFIG_POWER_RESET_VEXPRESS

The VExpress power-off/reset driver is not needed on 64-bit platforms as
PSCI power-off and reset can be used instead. Stop selecting it so it
can be disabled and not always built-in.

CONFIG_VEXPRESS_CONFIG can also be dropped as it was a dependency for
CONFIG_POWER_RESET_VEXPRESS.
