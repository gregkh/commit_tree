iio: dac: ad5360: Replace indio_dev->mlock with own device lock

As part of the general cleanup of indio_dev->mlock, this change replaces
it with a local lock on the device's state structure.
This also changes some internal functions to pass the pointer to the
state-struct vs a ref to indio_dev just to access the state-struct again.
