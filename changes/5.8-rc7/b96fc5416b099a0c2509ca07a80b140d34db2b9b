nvmem: ensure sysfs writes handle write-protect pin

Commit 2a127da461a9 ("nvmem: add support for the write-protect pin")
added support for handling write-protect pins to the nvmem core, and
Commit 1c89074bf850 ("eeprom: at24: remove the write-protect pin support")
retrofitted the at24 driver to use this support.

These changes broke write() on the nvmem sysfs attribute for eeproms
which utilize a write-protect pin, as the write callback invokes the
nvmem device's reg_write callback directly which no longer handles
changing the state of the write-protect pin.

Change the read and write callbacks for the sysfs attribute to invoke
nvmme_reg_read/nvmem_reg_write helpers which handle this, rather than
calling reg_read/reg_write directly.
