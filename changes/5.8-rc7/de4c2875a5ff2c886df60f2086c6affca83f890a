spi: dw: Set xfer effective_speed_hz

Seeing DW APB SSI controller doesn't support setting the exactly
requested SPI bus frequency, but only a rounded frequency determined
by means of the odd-numbered half-worded reference clock divider,
it would be good to tune the SPI core up and initialize the current
transfer effective_speed_hz. By doing so the core will be able to
execute the xfer-related delays with better accuracy.
