x86/int3: Ensure that poke_int3_handler() is not traced

In order to ensure poke_int3_handler() is completely self contained -- this
is called while modifying other text, imagine the fun of hitting another
INT3 -- ensure that everything it uses is not traced.

The primary means here is to force inlining; bsearch() is notrace because
all of lib/ is.
