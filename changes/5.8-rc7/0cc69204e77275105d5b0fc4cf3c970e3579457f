KVM: nVMX: Unconditionally validate CR3 during nested transitions

Unconditionally check the validity of the incoming CR3 during nested
VM-Enter/VM-Exit to avoid invoking kvm_read_cr3() in the common case
where the guest isn't using PAE paging.  If vmcs.GUEST_CR3 hasn't yet
been cached (common case), kvm_read_cr3() will trigger a VMREAD.  The
VMREAD (~30 cycles) alone is likely slower than nested_cr3_valid()
(~5 cycles if vcpu->arch.maxphyaddr gets a cache hit), and the poor
exchange only gets worse when retpolines are enabled as the call to
kvm_x86_ops.cache_reg() will incur a retpoline (60+ cycles).
