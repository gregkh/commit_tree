powerpc: Make test_translate_branch() independent of instruction length

test_translate_branch() uses two pointers to instructions within a
buffer, p and q, to test patch_branch(). The pointer arithmetic done on
them assumes a size of 4. This will not work if the instruction length
changes. Instead do the arithmetic relative to the void * to the buffer.
