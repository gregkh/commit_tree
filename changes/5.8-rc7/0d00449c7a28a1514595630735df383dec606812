x86: Replace ist_enter() with nmi_enter()

A few exceptions (like #DB and #BP) can happen at any location in the code,
this then means that tracers should treat events from these exceptions as
NMI-like. The interrupted context could be holding locks with interrupts
disabled for instance.

Similarly, #MC is an actual NMI-like exception.

All of them use ist_enter() which only concerns itself with RCU, but does
not do any of the other setup that NMIs need. This means things like:

	printk()
	  raw_spin_lock_irq(&logbuf_lock);
	  <#DB/#BP/#MC>
	     printk()
	       raw_spin_lock_irq(&logbuf_lock);

are entirely possible (well, not really since printk tries hard to
play nice, but the concept stands).

So replace ist_enter() with nmi_enter(). Also observe that any nmi_enter()
caller must be both notrace and NOKPROBE, or in the noinstr text section.
