net: add a new ndo_tunnel_ioctl method

This method is used to properly allow kernel callers of the IPv4 route
management ioctls.  The exsting ip_tunnel_ioctl helper is renamed to
ip_tunnel_ctl to better reflect that it doesn't directly implement ioctls
touching user memory, and is used for the guts of ndo_tunnel_ctl
implementations. A new ip_tunnel_ioctl helper is added that can be wired
up directly to the ndo_do_ioctl method and takes care of the copy to and
from userspace.
