mmc: host: sdhci: Implement the request_atomic() API

Implement the request_atomic() ops for the sdhci driver to process
one request in the atomic context if the card is nonremovable.

Moreover, we should return BUSY flag if controller has not released
the inhibit bits to allow HSQ trying to send request again in non-atomic
context.
