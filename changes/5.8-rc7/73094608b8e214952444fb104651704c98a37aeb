ALSA: usb-audio: Add registration quirk for Kingston HyperX Cloud Flight S

Similar to the Kingston HyperX AMP, the Kingston HyperX Cloud
Alpha S (0951:0x16ea) uses two interfaces, but only the second
interface contains the capture stream. This patch delays the
registration until the second interface appears.
