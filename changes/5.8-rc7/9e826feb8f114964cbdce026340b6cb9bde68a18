KVM: nVMX: Drop superfluous VMREAD of vmcs02.GUEST_SYSENTER_*

Don't propagate GUEST_SYSENTER_* from vmcs02 to vmcs12 on nested VM-Exit
as the vmcs12 fields are updated in vmx_set_msr(), and writes to the
corresponding MSRs are always intercepted by KVM when running L2.

Dropping the propagation was intended to be done in the same commit that
added vmcs12 writes in vmx_set_msr()[1], but for reasons unknown was
only shuffled around[2][3].
