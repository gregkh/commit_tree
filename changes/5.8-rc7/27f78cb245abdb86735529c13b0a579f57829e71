cxgb4: parse TC-U32 key values and masks natively

TC-U32 passes all keys values and masks in __be32 format. The parser
already expects this and hence pass the value and masks in __be32
natively to the parser.

Fixes following sparse warnings in several places:
cxgb4_tc_u32.c:57:21: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base
types)
cxgb4_tc_u32.c:57:21:    expected unsigned int [usertype] val
cxgb4_tc_u32.c:57:21:    got restricted __be32 [usertype] val
cxgb4_tc_u32_parse.h:48:24: warning: cast to restricted __be32
