net/smc: remove handling of CONFIRM_RKEY_CONTINUE

The new SMC-R multiple link support will support a maximum of 3 links,
and one CONFIRM_RKEY LLC message can transport 3 rkeys of an rmb buffer.
There is no need for the LLC message type CONFIRM_RKEY_CONTINUE which is
needed when more than 3 rkeys per rmb buffer needs to be exchanged.
