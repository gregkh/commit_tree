libsymbols kallsyms: Move hex2u64 out of header

hex2u64 is a helper that's out of place in kallsyms.h as not being
kallsyms related. Move from kallsyms.h to the only user.

Committer notes:

Move it out of tools/lib/symbol/kallsyms.c as well, as we had to leave
it there in the previous patch lest we break the build.
