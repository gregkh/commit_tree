powerpc: Use mm_context vas_windows counter to issue CP_ABORT

set_thread_uses_vas() sets used_vas flag for a process that opened VAS
window and issue CP_ABORT during context switch for only that process.
In multi-thread application, windows can be shared. For example Thread
A can open a window and Thread B can run COPY/PASTE instructions to
send NX request which may cause corruption or snooping or a covert
channel Also once this flag is set, continue to run CP_ABORT even the
VAS window is closed.

So define vas-windows counter in process mm_context, increment this
counter for each window open and decrement it for window close. If
vas-windows is set, issue CP_ABORT during context switch. It means
clear the foreign real address mapping only if the process / thread
uses COPY/PASTE. Then disable it for that process if windows are not
open.

Moved set_thread_uses_vas() code to vas_tx_win_open() as this
functionality is needed only for userspace open windows. We are adding
VAS userspace support along with this fix. So no need to include this
fix in stable releases.
