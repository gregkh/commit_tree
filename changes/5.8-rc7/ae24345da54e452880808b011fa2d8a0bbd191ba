bpf: Implement an interface to register bpf_iter targets

The target can call bpf_iter_reg_target() to register itself.
The needed information:
  target:           target name
  seq_ops:          the seq_file operations for the target
  init_seq_private  target callback to initialize seq_priv during file open
  fini_seq_private  target callback to clean up seq_priv during file release
  seq_priv_size:    the private_data size needed by the seq_file
                    operations

The target name represents a target which provides a seq_ops
for iterating objects.

The target can provide two callback functions, init_seq_private
and fini_seq_private, called during file open/release time.
For example, /proc/net/{tcp6, ipv6_route, netlink, ...}, net
name space needs to be setup properly during file open and
released properly during file release.

Function bpf_iter_unreg_target() is also implemented to unregister
a particular target.
