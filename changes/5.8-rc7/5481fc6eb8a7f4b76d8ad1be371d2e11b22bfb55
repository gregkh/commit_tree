afs: Fix hang on rmmod due to outstanding timer

The fileserver probe timer, net->fs_probe_timer, isn't cancelled when
the kafs module is being removed and so the count it holds on
net->servers_outstanding doesn't get dropped..

This causes rmmod to wait forever.  The hung process shows a stack like:

	afs_purge_servers+0x1b5/0x23c [kafs]
	afs_net_exit+0x44/0x6e [kafs]
	ops_exit_list+0x72/0x93
	unregister_pernet_operations+0x14c/0x1ba
	unregister_pernet_subsys+0x1d/0x2a
	afs_exit+0x29/0x6f [kafs]
	__do_sys_delete_module.isra.0+0x1a2/0x24b
	do_syscall_64+0x51/0x95
	entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9

Fix this by:

 (1) Attempting to cancel the probe timer and, if successful, drop the
     count that the timer was holding.

 (2) Make the timer function just drop the count and not schedule the
     prober if the afs portion of net namespace is being destroyed.

Also, whilst we're at it, make the following changes:

 (3) Initialise net->servers_outstanding to 1 and decrement it before
     waiting on it so that it doesn't generate wake up events by being
     decremented to 0 until we're cleaning up.

 (4) Switch the atomic_dec() on ->servers_outstanding for ->fs_timer in
     afs_purge_servers() to use the helper function for that.
