net/smc: fix restoring of fallback changes

When a listen socket is closed then all non-accepted sockets in its
accept queue are to be released. Inside __smc_release() the helper
smc_restore_fallback_changes() restores the changes done to the socket
without to check if the clcsocket has a file set. This can result in
a crash. Fix this by checking the file pointer first.
