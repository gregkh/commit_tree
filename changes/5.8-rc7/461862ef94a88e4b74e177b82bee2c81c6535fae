powerpc/vas: Return credits after handling fault

NX uses credit mechanism to control the number of requests issued on
a specific window at any point of time. Only send windows and fault
window are used credits. When the request is issued on a given window,
a credit is taken. This credit will be returned after that request is
processed. If credits are not available, returns RMA_Busy for send
window and RMA_Reject for fault window.

NX expects OS to return credit for send window after processing fault
CRB. Also credit has to be returned for fault window after handling
the fault.
