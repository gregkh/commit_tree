bpf: Enable bpf_iter targets registering ctx argument types

Commit b121b341e598 ("bpf: Add PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL
support") adds a field btf_id_or_null_non0_off to
bpf_prog->aux structure to indicate that the
first ctx argument is PTR_TO_BTF_ID reg_type and
all others are PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL.
This approach does not really scale if we have
other different reg types in the future, e.g.,
a pointer to a buffer.

This patch enables bpf_iter targets registering ctx argument
reg types which may be different from the default one.
For example, for pointers to structures, the default reg_type
is PTR_TO_BTF_ID for tracing program. The target can register
a particular pointer type as PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL which can
be used by the verifier to enforce accesses.
