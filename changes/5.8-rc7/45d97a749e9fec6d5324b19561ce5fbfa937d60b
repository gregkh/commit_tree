efi/gop: Allow automatically choosing the best mode

Add the ability to automatically pick the highest resolution video mode
(defined as the product of vertical and horizontal resolution) by using
a command-line argument of the form
	video=efifb:auto

If there are multiple modes with the highest resolution, pick one with
the highest color depth.
