scripts: kernel-doc: accept negation like !@var

On a few places, it sometimes need to indicate a negation of a
parameter, like:

	!@fshared

This pattern happens, for example, at:

	kernel/futex.c

and it is perfectly valid. However, kernel-doc currently
transforms it into:

	!**fshared**

This won't do what it would be expected.

Fortunately, fixing the script is a simple matter of storing
the "!" before "@" and adding it after the bold markup, like:

	**!fshared**
