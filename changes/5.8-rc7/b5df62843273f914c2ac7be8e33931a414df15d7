fs/xfs: Combine xfs_diflags_to_linux() and xfs_diflags_to_iflags()

The functionality in xfs_diflags_to_linux() and xfs_diflags_to_iflags() are
nearly identical.  The only difference is that *_to_linux() is called after
inode setup and disallows changing the DAX flag.

Combining them can be done with a flag which indicates if this is the initial
setup to allow the DAX flag to be properly set only at init time.

So remove xfs_diflags_to_linux() and call the modified xfs_diflags_to_iflags()
directly.

While we are here simplify xfs_diflags_to_iflags() to take struct xfs_inode and
use xfs_ip2xflags() to ensure future diflags are included correctly.
