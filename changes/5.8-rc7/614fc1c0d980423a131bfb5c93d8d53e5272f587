nvme-fc: print proper nvme-fc devloss_tmo value

The nvme-fc devloss_tmo is computed as the min of either the
ctrl_loss_tmo (max_retries * reconnect_delay) or the remote port's
devloss_tmo. But what gets printed as the nvme-fc devloss_tmo in
nvme_fc_reconnect_or_delete() is always the remote port's devloss_tmo
value. So correct this by printing the min value instead.
