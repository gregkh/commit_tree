PCI: dwc: Clean up computing of msix_tbl

Commit 6f5e193bfb55 ("PCI: dwc: Fix dw_pcie_ep_raise_msix_irq() to get
correct MSI-X table address") overcomplicated the computation of the
msix_tbl address. Simplify it as it's simply the addr + offset. Provided
addr is (void *) already.

objdump -d shows no difference after this patch.
