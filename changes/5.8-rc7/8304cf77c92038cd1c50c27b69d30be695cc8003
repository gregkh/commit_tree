ALSA: firewire-lib: fix invalid assignment to union data for directional parameter

Although the value of FDF is used just for outgoing stream, the assignment
to union member is done for both directions of stream. At present this
causes no issue because the value of same position is reassigned later for
opposite stream. However, it's better to add if statement.
