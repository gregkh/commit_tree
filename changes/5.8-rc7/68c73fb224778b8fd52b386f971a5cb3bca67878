platform/x86: intel_telemetry: Convert to use new SCU IPC API

Convert the Intel Apollo Lake telemetry driver to use the new SCU IPC
API. This allows us to get rid of the duplicate PMC IPC implementation
which is now covered in SCU IPC driver.

Also move telemetry specific IPC message constant to the telemetry
driver where it belongs.
