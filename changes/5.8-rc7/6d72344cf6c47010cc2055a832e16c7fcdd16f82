IB/ipoib: Increase ipoib Datagram mode MTU's upper limit

Currently the ipoib UD mtu is restricted to 4K bytes. Remove this
limitation so that the IPOIB module can potentially use an MTU (in UD
mode) that is bounded by the MTU of the underlying device. A field is
added to the ib_port_attr structure to indicate the maximum physical
MTU the underlying device supports.
