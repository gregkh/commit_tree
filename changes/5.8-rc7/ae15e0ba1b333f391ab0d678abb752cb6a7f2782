ice: Change number of XDP Tx queues to match number of Rx queues

In current implementation number of XDP Tx queues is the same as
the number of transmit queues, which is not always true. This
patch changes this number to match the number of receive queues.
XDP programs are running on Rx rings, so what we actually need to
provide is the XDP Tx ring per each Rx ring so that the whole XDP
ecosystem is functional, e.g. if the result of XDP prog is XDP_TX
then you have the need to access the XDP Tx ring.
