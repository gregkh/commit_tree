mmc: sdhci-msm: Use OPP API to set clk/perf state

On some qualcomm SoCs we need to vote on a performance state of a power
domain depending on the clock rates. Hence move to using OPP api to set
the clock rate and performance state specified in the OPP table.
On platforms without an OPP table, dev_pm_opp_set_rate() is eqvivalent to
clk_set_rate()
