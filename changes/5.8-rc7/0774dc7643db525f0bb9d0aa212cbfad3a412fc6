dlm: use the tcp version of accept_from_sock for sctp as well

The only difference between a few missing fixes applied to the SCTP
one is that TCP uses ->getpeername to get the remote address, while
SCTP uses kernel_getsockopt(.. SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR).  But given that
getpeername is defined to return the primary address for sctp, there
doesn't seem to be any reason for the different way of quering the
peername, or all the code duplication.
