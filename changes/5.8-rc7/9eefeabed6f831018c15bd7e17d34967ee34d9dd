devlink: Add 'mirror' trap action

The action is used by control traps such as IGMP query. The packet is
flooded by the device, but also trapped to the CPU in order for the
software bridge to mark the receiving port as a multicast router port.
Such packets are marked with 'skb->offload_fwd_mark = 1' in order to
prevent the software bridge from flooding them again.
