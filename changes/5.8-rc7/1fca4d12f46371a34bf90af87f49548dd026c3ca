rcu: Expedite first two FQS scans under callback-overload conditions

Even if some CPUs have excessive numbers of callbacks, RCU's grace-period
kthread will still wait normally between successive force-quiescent-state
scans.  The first two are the most important, as they are the ones that
enlist aid from the scheduler when overloaded.  This commit therefore
omits the wait before the first and the second force-quiescent-state
scan under callback-overload conditions.

This approach was inspired by a discussion with Jeff Roberson.
