compiler_attributes.h: Support no_sanitize_undefined check with GCC 4

UBSAN is supported since GCC 4.9, which unfortunately did not yet have
__has_attribute(). To work around, the __GCC4_has_attribute workaround
requires defining which compiler version supports the given attribute.

In the case of no_sanitize_undefined, it is the first version that
supports UBSAN, which is GCC 4.9.
