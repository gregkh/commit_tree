scsi: storvsc: Re-init stor_chns when a channel interrupt is re-assigned

For each storvsc_device, storvsc keeps track of the channel target CPUs
associated to the device (alloced_cpus) and it uses this information to
fill a "cache" (stor_chns) mapping CPU->channel according to a certain
heuristic.  Update the alloced_cpus mask and the stor_chns array when a
channel of the storvsc device is re-assigned to a different CPU.
