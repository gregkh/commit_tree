phy: samsung: s5pv210-usb2: Add delay after reset

The USB phy takes some time to reset, so make sure we give it to it. The
delay length was taken from the 4x12 phy driver.

This manifested in issues with the DWC2 driver since commit fe369e1826b3
("usb: dwc2: Make dwc2_readl/writel functions endianness-agnostic.")
where the endianness check would read the DWC ID as 0 due to the phy still
resetting, resulting in the wrong endian mode being chosen.
