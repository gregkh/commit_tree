scsi: target: loopback: Fix READ with data and sensebytes

We use tcm_loop with tape emulations running on tcmu.

In case application reads a short tape block with a longer READ, or a long
tape block with a short READ, according to SCC spec data has to be
tranferred _and_ sensebytes with ILI set and information field containing
the residual count. Similar problem also exists when using fixed block
size in READ.

Up to now tcm_loop is not prepared to handle sensebytes if input data is
provided, as in tcm_loop_queue_data_in() it only sets SAM_STAT_GOOD and, if
necessary, the residual count.

To fix the bug, the same handling for sensebytes as present in
tcm_loop_queue_status() must be done in tcm_loop_queue_data_in() also.

After adding this handling, the two function now are nearly identical, so I
created a single function with two wrappers.
