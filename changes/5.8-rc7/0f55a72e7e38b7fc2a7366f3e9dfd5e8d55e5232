staging: wfx: stop changing filtering rule in wfx_hw_scan()

It is not very clear why driver ask to firmware to stop filtering probe
request during scan. It is particularly weird because scan is not
supported in AP mode. In add, it does not restore previous filtering
state after scanning.

It seems to be a mistake and should be dropped.
