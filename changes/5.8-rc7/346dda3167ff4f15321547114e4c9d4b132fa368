dt-bindings: ufs: ti: Fix address properties handling

The ti,j721e-ufs schema and example have a couple of problems related to
address properties. First, the default #size-cells and #address-cells
are 1 for examples, so they need to be overriden with a bus node.
Second, address translation for the child ufs node is broken because
'ranges', '#address-cells', and '#size-cells' are missing from the
schema.
