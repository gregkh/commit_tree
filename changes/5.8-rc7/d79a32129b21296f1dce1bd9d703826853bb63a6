bpf: Selftests, remove prints from sockmap tests

The prints in the test_sockmap programs were only useful when we
didn't have enough control over test infrastructure to know from
user program what was being pushed into kernel side.

Now that we have or will shortly have better test controls lets
remove the printers. This means we can remove half the programs
and cleanup bpf side.
