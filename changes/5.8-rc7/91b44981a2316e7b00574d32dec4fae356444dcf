interconnect: Do not skip aggregation for disabled paths

When an interconnect path is being disabled, currently we don't aggregate
the requests for it afterwards. But the re-aggregation step shouldn't be
skipped, as it may leave the nodes with outdated bandwidth data. This
outdated data may actually keep the path still enabled and prevent the
device from going into lower power states.
