usb: hso: Fix debug compile warning on sparc32

On sparc32, tcflag_t is "unsigned long", unlike on all other
architectures, where it is "unsigned int":

    drivers/net/usb/hso.c: In function ‘hso_serial_set_termios’:
    include/linux/kern_levels.h:5:18: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘unsigned int’, but argument 4 has type ‘tcflag_t {aka long unsigned int}’ [-Wformat=]
    drivers/net/usb/hso.c:1393:3: note: in expansion of macro ‘hso_dbg’
       hso_dbg(0x16, "Termios called with: cflags new[%d] - old[%d]\n",
       ^~~~~~~
    include/linux/kern_levels.h:5:18: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘unsigned int’, but argument 5 has type ‘tcflag_t {aka long unsigned int}’ [-Wformat=]
    drivers/net/usb/hso.c:1393:3: note: in expansion of macro ‘hso_dbg’
       hso_dbg(0x16, "Termios called with: cflags new[%d] - old[%d]\n",
       ^~~~~~~

As "unsigned long" is 32-bit on sparc32, fix this by casting all tcflag_t
parameters to "unsigned int".
While at it, use "%u" to format unsigned numbers.
