drm/i915/audio: fix compressed_bpp check

The early check for compressed_bpp being zero is too early, as it is hit
also when DSC is not enabled. Move the checks down to where the values
are actually needed. This is a paranoid check for a situation that
should not happen, so we don't really care about handling it gracefully
apart from not oopsing.
