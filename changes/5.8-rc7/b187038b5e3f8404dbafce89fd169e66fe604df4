x86/kvm/hyper-v: Add support for synthetic debugger via hypercalls

There is another mode for the synthetic debugger which uses hypercalls
to send/recv network data instead of the MSR interface.

This interface is much slower and less recommended since you might get
a lot of VMExits while KDVM polling for new packets to recv, rather
than simply checking the pending page to see if there is data avialble
and then request.
