arm64: kexec_file: Avoid temp buffer for RNG seed

After using get_random_bytes(), you want to wipe the buffer
afterward so the seed remains secret.

In this case, we can eliminate the temporary buffer entirely.
fdt_setprop_placeholder() returns a pointer to the property value
buffer, allowing us to put the random data directly in there without
using a temporary buffer at all.  Faster and less stack all in one.
