drm/fb-helper: Remove return value from drm_fbdev_generic_setup()

Generic fbdev emulation is a DRM client. Drivers should invoke the
setup function, but not depend on its success. Hence remove the return
value.

v3:
	* document stricter requirements for call sequence
v2:
	* warn if fbdev device has not been registered yet
	* document the new behavior
	* convert the existing warning to the new dev_ interface
