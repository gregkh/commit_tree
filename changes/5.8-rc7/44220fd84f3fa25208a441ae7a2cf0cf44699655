MIPS: tools: Show result for loongson3-llsc-check

It is better to show the result before loongson3-llsc-check exit,
otherwise we can see nothing if the return status is EXIT_SUCCESS,
it seems confusing.

E.g. without this patch:

[loongson@localhost tools]$ ./loongson3-llsc-check ../../../vmlinux
[loongson@localhost tools]$

With this patch:

[loongson@localhost tools]$ ./loongson3-llsc-check ../../../vmlinux
loongson3-llsc-check returns success
[loongson@localhost tools]$
