drm/i915/gt: Improve precision on defer_request assert

The kernel_context does not use initial-breadcrumbs, so when we ask if
its requests have started we do so by comparing against the completion
seqno of the previous request. This is very imprecise, not precise
enough for the defer_request assertion.
