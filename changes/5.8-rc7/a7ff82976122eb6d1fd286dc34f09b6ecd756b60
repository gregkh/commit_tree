drivers: thermal: tsens: Merge tsens-common.c into tsens.c

tsens-common.c has outlived its usefuless. It was created expecting lots
of custom routines per version of the TSENS IP. We haven't needed those,
there is now only data in the version-specific files.

Merge the code for tsens-common.c into tsens.c. As a result,
- Remove any unnecessary forward declarations in tsens.h.
- Add a Linaro copyright to tsens.c.
- Fixup the Makefile to remove tsens-common.c.
- Where it made sense, fix some 80-column alignments in the
  tsens-common.c code being copied over.

There is no functional change with this patch.
