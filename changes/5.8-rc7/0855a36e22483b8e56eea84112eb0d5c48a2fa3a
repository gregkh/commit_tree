MAINTAINERS: dt: fix pointers for ARM Integrator, Versatile and RealView

There's a conversion from a plain text binding file into 4 yaml ones.
The old file got removed, causing this new warning:

	Warning: MAINTAINERS references a file that doesn't exist: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/arm-boards

Address it by replacing the old reference by the new ones
