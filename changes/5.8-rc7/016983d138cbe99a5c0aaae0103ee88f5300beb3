hwmon: (max6697) Make sure the OVERT mask is set correctly

Per the datasheet for max6697, OVERT mask and ALERT mask are different.
For example, the 7th bit of OVERT is the local channel but for alert
mask, the 6th bit is the local channel. Therefore, we can't apply the
same mask for both registers. In addition to that, the max6697 driver
is supposed to be compatibale with different models. I manually went over
all the listed chips and made sure all chip types have the same layout.

Testing;
    mask value of 0x9 should map to 0x44 for ALERT and 0x84 for OVERT.
    I used iotool to read the reg value back to verify. I only tested this
    change on max6581.
