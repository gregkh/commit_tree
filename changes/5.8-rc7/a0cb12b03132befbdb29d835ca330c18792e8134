selftests/bpf: Make sure optvals > PAGE_SIZE are bypassed

We are relying on the fact, that we can pass > sizeof(int) optvals
to the SOL_IP+IP_FREEBIND option (the kernel will take first 4 bytes).
In the BPF program we check that we can only touch PAGE_SIZE bytes,
but the real optlen is PAGE_SIZE * 2. In both cases, we override it to
some predefined value and trim the optlen.

Also, let's modify exiting IP_TOS usecase to test optlen=0 case
where BPF program just bypasses the data as is.
