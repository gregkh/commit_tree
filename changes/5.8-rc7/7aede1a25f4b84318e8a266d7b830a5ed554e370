RDMA/mlx5: Store QP type in the vendor QP structure

QP type is stored in the IB/core QP struct, but it doesn't have all the
needed information, like internal QP type used in the driver itself.
Update mlx5_ib to have cached QP type which includes both IBTA and
Mellanox specific one.

Such change allows us to make even further cleanup of QP creation flow.
