perf list: Add metrics to command line usage

Before:

 Usage: perf list [<options>] [hw|sw|cache|tracepoint|pmu|sdt|event_glob]

After:

 Usage: perf list [<options>] [hw|sw|cache|tracepoint|pmu|sdt|metric|metricgroup|event_glob]

Committer testing:

Before and after we get these outputs on a Lenovo t480s (i7-8650U):

  # perf list metricgroup

  # perf list metric | head -11

  Metrics:

    Backend_Bound
         [This category represents fraction of slots where no uops are being delivered due to a lack of required resources for accepting new uops in the Backend]
    Backend_Bound_SMT
         [This category represents fraction of slots where no uops are being delivered due to a lack of required resources for accepting new uops in the Backend. SMT version; use when SMT is enabled and measuring per logical CPU]
    Bad_Speculation
         [This category represents fraction of slots wasted due to incorrect speculations]
    Bad_Speculation_SMT
         [This category represents fraction of slots wasted due to incorrect speculations. SMT version; use when SMT is enabled and measuring per logical CPU]
