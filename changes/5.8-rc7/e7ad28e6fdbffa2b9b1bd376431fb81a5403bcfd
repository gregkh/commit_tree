selftests/bpf: Add a default $(CXX) value

When using make kselftest TARGETS=bpf, tools/bpf is built with
MAKEFLAGS=rR, which causes $(CXX) to be undefined, which in turn causes
the build to fail with

  CXX      test_cpp
/bin/sh: 2: g: not found

Fix by adding a default $(CXX) value, like tools/build/feature/Makefile
already does.
