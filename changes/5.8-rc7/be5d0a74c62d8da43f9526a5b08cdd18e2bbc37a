mm: memcontrol: switch to native NR_ANON_MAPPED counter

Memcg maintains a private MEMCG_RSS counter.  This divergence from the
generic VM accounting means unnecessary code overhead, and creates a
dependency for memcg that page->mapping is set up at the time of charging,
so that page types can be told apart.

Convert the generic accounting sites to mod_lruvec_page_state and friends
to maintain the per-cgroup vmstat counter of NR_ANON_MAPPED.  We use
lock_page_memcg() to stabilize page->mem_cgroup during rmap changes, the
same way we do for NR_FILE_MAPPED.

With the previous patch removing MEMCG_CACHE and the private NR_SHMEM
counter, this patch finally eliminates the need to have page->mapping set
up at charge time.  However, we need to have page->mem_cgroup set up by
the time rmap runs and does the accounting, so switch the commit and the
rmap callbacks around.
