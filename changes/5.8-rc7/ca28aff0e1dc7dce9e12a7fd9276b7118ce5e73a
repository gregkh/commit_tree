HID: quirks: Always poll Obins Anne Pro 2 keyboard

The Obins Anne Pro 2 keyboard (04d9:a293) disconnects after a few
minutes of inactivity when using it wired and typing does not result
in any input events any more. This is a common firmware flaw. So add
the ALWAYS_POLL quirk for this device.

GitHub user Dietrich Moerman (dietrichm) tested the quirk and
requested my help in my project
https://github.com/sriemer/fix-linux-mouse issue 22 to provide
this patch.
