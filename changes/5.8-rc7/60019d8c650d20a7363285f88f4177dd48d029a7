ALSA: hda/tegra: workaround playback failure on Tegra194

Tegra194 has 4 SDO lines and with this configuration playback fails
for 44.1K/48K, 2-channel and 16-bps. It results in below print,
  "aplay: pcm_write:2011: write error: Input/output error"

Below relation is used to derive stripe control and is referenced
from HD Audio Specification: Revision 1.0a.
  { ((num_channels * bits_per_sample) / number of SDOs) >= 8 }

Due to a legacy HW design problem, playback issue is hit while using
a stripe value resulting from above formula when ratio is '8'. Thus
it is recommended that the ratio must be greater than '8'. Since the
number of SDO lines is in powers of 2, next available ratio '16' is
used as a limiting factor on Tegra194 to workaround the problem.
