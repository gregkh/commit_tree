xfs: group quota should return EDQUOT when prj quota enabled

Long ago, group & project quota were mutually exclusive, and so
when we turned on XFS_QMOPT_ENOSPC ("return ENOSPC if project quota
is exceeded") when project quota was enabled, we only needed to
disable it again for user quota.

When group & project quota got separated, this got missed, and as a
result if project quota is enabled and group quota is exceeded, the
error code returned is incorrectly returned as ENOSPC not EDQUOT.

Fix this by stripping XFS_QMOPT_ENOSPC out of flags for group
quota when we try to reserve the space.
