MIPS: Tidy up CP0.Config6 bits definition

CP0.Config6 is a Vendor-defined register whose bits definitions are
different from one to another. Recently, Xuerui's Loongson-3 patch and
Serge's P5600 patch make the definitions inconsistency and unclear.

To make life easy, this patch tidy the definition up:
1, Add a _MTI_ infix for proAptiv/P5600 feature bits;
2, Add a _LOONGSON_ infix for Loongson-3 feature bits;
3, Add bit6/bit7 definition for Loongson-3 which will be used later.

All existing users of these macros are updated.
