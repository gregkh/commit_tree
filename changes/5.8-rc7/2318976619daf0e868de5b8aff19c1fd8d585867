ARM: 8976/1: module: allow arch overrides for .init section names

ARM stores unwind information for .init.text in sections named
.ARM.extab.init.text and .ARM.exidx.init.text.  Since those aren't
currently recognized as init sections, they're allocated along with the
core section, and relocation fails if the core and the init section are
allocated from different regions and can't reach other.

  final section addresses:
        ...
        0x7f800000 .init.text
        ..
        0xcbb54078 .ARM.exidx.init.text
        ..

 section 16 reloc 0 sym '': relocation 42 out of range (0xcbb54078 ->
 0x7f800000)

Allow architectures to override the section name so that ARM can fix
this.
