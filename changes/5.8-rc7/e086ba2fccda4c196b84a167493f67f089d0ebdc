e1000e: disable s0ix entry and exit flows for ME systems

Since ME systems do not support SLP_S0 in S0ix state, and S0ix entry
and exit flows may cause errors on them it is best to avoid using
e1000e_s0ix_entry_flow and e1000e_s0ix_exit_flow functions.

This was done by creating a struct of all devices that comes with ME
and by checking if the current device has ME.
