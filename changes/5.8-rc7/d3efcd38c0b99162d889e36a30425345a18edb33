powerpc/8xx: Drop CONFIG_8xx_COPYBACK option

CONFIG_8xx_COPYBACK was there to help disabling copyback cache mode
for debuging hardware. But nobody will design new boards with 8xx now.

All 8xx platforms select it, so make it the default and remove
the option.

Also remove the Mx_RESETVAL values which are pretty useless and hide
the real value while reading code.
