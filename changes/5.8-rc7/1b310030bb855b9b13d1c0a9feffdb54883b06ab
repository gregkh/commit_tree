kdb: Cleanup math with KDB_CMD_HISTORY_COUNT

From code inspection the math in handle_ctrl_cmd() looks super sketchy
because it subjects -1 from cmdptr and then does a "%
KDB_CMD_HISTORY_COUNT".  It turns out that this code works because
"cmdptr" is unsigned and KDB_CMD_HISTORY_COUNT is a nice power of 2.
Let's make this a little less sketchy.

This patch should be a no-op.
