ocfs2: avoid inode removal while nfsd is accessing it

Patch series "ocfs2: fix nfsd over ocfs2 issues", v2.

This is a series of patches to fix issues on nfsd over ocfs2.  patch 1
is to avoid inode removed while nfsd access it patch 2 & 3 is to fix a
panic issue.

This patch (of 4):

When nfsd is getting file dentry using handle or parent dentry of some
dentry, one cluster lock is used to avoid inode removed from other node,
but it still could be removed from local node, so use a rw lock to avoid
this.
