KVM: VMX: Always treat MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES as a valid PMU MSR

Unconditionally return true when querying the validity of
MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES so as to defer the validity check to
intel_pmu_{get,set}_msr(), which can properly give the MSR a pass when
the access is initiated from host userspace.  The MSR is emulated so
there is no underlying hardware dependency to worry about.
