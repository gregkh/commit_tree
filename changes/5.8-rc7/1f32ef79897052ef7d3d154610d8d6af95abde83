afs: afs_write_end() should change i_size under the right lock

Fix afs_write_end() to change i_size under vnode->cb_lock rather than
->wb_lock so that it doesn't race with afs_vnode_commit_status() and
afs_getattr().

The ->wb_lock is only meant to guard access to ->wb_keys which isn't
accessed by that piece of code.
