iio: buffer: re-introduce bitmap_zalloc() for trialmask

Commit 3862828a903d3 ("iio: buffer: Switch to bitmap_zalloc()") introduced
bitmap_alloc(), but commit 20ea39ef9f2f9 ("iio: Fix scan mask selection")
reverted it.

This change adds it back. The only difference is that it's adding
bitmap_zalloc(). There might be some changes later that would require
initializing it to zero. In any case, now it's already zero-ing the
trialmask.

Appears to have been the result of merge conflict resolution rather
than an intentional revert.
