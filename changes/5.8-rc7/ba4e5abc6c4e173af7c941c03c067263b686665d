ASoC: SOF: nocodec: conditionally set dpcm_capture/dpcm_playback flags

With additional checks on dailinks, we see errors such as

[ 3.000418] sof-nocodec sof-nocodec: CPU DAI DMIC01 Pin for rtd
NoCodec-6 does not support playback

It's not clear why we set the dpcm_playback and dpcm_capture flags
unconditionally, add a check on number of channels for each direction
to avoid invalid configurations.
