PCI: aardvark: Train link immediately after enabling training

Adding even 100ms (PCI_PM_D3COLD_WAIT) delay between enabling link
training and starting link training causes detection issues with some
buggy cards (such as Compex WLE900VX).

Move the code which enables link training immediately before the one
which starts link traning.

This fixes detection issues of Compex WLE900VX card on Turris MOX after
cold boot.
