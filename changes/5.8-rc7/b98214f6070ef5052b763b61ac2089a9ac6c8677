scsi: lpfc: Remove re-binding of nvme rport during registration

The lldd rebinds the ndlp with rport during a nvme rport registration (via
nvme_fc_register_remoteport). If rport & ndlp pointers are same as the
previous one, the lldd will re-use the ndlp and rport association without
re-initialization. This assumption is incorrect. The lldd should be
ignorant of whether the returned rport pointer is new or not, and should
always assume it is new.

Remove the re-binding code, always assumes that rport pointer received from
transport is a new pointer.
