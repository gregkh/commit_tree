firmware: imx: scu: Fix corruption of header

The header of the message to send can be changed if the
response is longer than the request:
 - 1st word, the header is sent
 - the remaining words of the message are sent
 - the response is received asynchronously during the
   execution of the loop, changing the size field in
   the header
 - the for loop test the termination condition using
   the corrupted header

It is the case for the API build_info which has just a
header as request but 3 words in response.

This issue is fixed storing the header locally instead of
using a pointer on it.

Fixes: edbee095fafb (firmware: imx: add SCU firmware driver support)
