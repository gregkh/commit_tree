net/smc: remove freed buffer from list

Two buffers are allocated for each SMC connection. Each buffer is
added to a buffer list after creation. When the second buffer
allocation fails, the first buffer is freed but not deleted from
the list. This might result in crashes when another connection picks
up the freed buffer later and starts to work with it.
