arm64: dts: rockchip: fix pd_tcpc0 and pd_tcpc1 node position on rk3399

The pd_tcpc0 and pd_tcpc1 nodes are currently a sub node of pd_vio.
In the rk3399 TRM figure of the 'Power Domain Partition' and in the
table of 'Power Domain and Voltage Domain Summary' these power domains
are positioned directly under VD_LOGIC, so fix that in 'rk3399.dtsi'.
