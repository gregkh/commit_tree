x86/entry: Use idtentry for interrupts

Replace the extra interrupt handling code and reuse the existing idtentry
machinery. This moves the irq stack switching on 64-bit from ASM to C code;
32-bit already does the stack switching in C.

This requires to remove HAVE_IRQ_EXIT_ON_IRQ_STACK as the stack switch is
not longer in the low level entry code.
