arm64: Add KRYO4XX silver CPU cores to erratum list 1530923 and 1024718

KRYO4XX silver/LITTLE CPU cores with revision r1p0 are affected by
erratum 1530923 and 1024718, so add them to the respective list.
The variant and revision bits are implementation defined and are
different from the their Cortex CPU counterparts on which they are
based on, i.e., r1p0 is equivalent to rdpe.
