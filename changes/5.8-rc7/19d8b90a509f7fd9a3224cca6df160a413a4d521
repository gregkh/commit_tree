IB/hfi1: RSM rules for AIP

This is implementation of RSM rule for AIP packets.
AIP rule will use rule RSM2 and will match standard
Infiniband packet containg BTH (LNH==BTH) and
having Dest QPN prefixed with value 0x81. Spread between
receive contexts will be done using source QPN bits.

VNIC and AIP will share receive contexts, so their rules
will point to the same RMT entries and their shared
code is moved to separate functions.
If any of the rules is active RMT mapping will be skipped
for latter.

Changed function hfi1_vnic_is_rsm_full to be more general
and moved it from main header to chip.c.

Changed the order of RSM rules because AIP rule as
more specific one is needed to be placed before more
general QOS rule. Rules are occupying two last RSM
registers.
