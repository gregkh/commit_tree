hwmon: Add Gateworks System Controller support

The Gateworks System Controller has a hwmon sub-component that exposes
up to 16 ADC's, some of which are temperature sensors, others which are
voltage inputs. The ADC configuration (register mapping and name) is
configured via device-tree and varies board to board.
