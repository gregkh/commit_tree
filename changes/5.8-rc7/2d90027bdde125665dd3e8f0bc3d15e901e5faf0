staging: rtl8188eu: remove unnecessary asignment

Remove unnecessary asignment in SwLedBlink1(). The code path with the
asignment 'pLed->BlinkTimes = 0' is only executed when
'pLed->BlinkTimes' is already zero and the value is not changed between
the test 'if (pLed->BlinkTimes == 0)' and the asignment.
