samples, bpf: Refactor kprobe, tail call kern progs map definition

Because the previous two commit replaced the bpf_load implementation of
the user program with libbpf, the corresponding kernel program's MAP
definition can be replaced with new BTF-defined map syntax.

This commit only updates the samples which uses libbpf API for loading
bpf program not with bpf_load.
