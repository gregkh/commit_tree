efi/libstub/arm64: link stub lib.a conditionally

Since commit 799c43415442 ("kbuild: thin archives make default for
all archs"), core-y is passed to the linker with --whole-archive.
Hence, the whole of stub library is linked to vmlinux.

Use libs-y so that lib.a is passed after --no-whole-archive for
conditional linking.

The unused drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/relocate.o will be dropped
for ARCH=arm64.
