lockdep: Prepare for noinstr sections

Force inlining and prevent instrumentation of all sorts by marking the
functions which are invoked from low level entry code with 'noinstr'.

Split the irqflags tracking into two parts. One which does the heavy
lifting while RCU is watching and the final one which can be invoked after
RCU is turned off.
