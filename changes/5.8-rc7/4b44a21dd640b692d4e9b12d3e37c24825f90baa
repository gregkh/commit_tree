irq_work, smp: Allow irq_work on call_single_queue

Currently irq_work_queue_on() will issue an unconditional
arch_send_call_function_single_ipi() and has the handler do
irq_work_run().

This is unfortunate in that it makes the IPI handler look at a second
cacheline and it misses the opportunity to avoid the IPI. Instead note
that struct irq_work and struct __call_single_data are very similar in
layout, so use a few bits in the flags word to encode a type and stick
the irq_work on the call_single_queue list.
