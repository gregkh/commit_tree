fpga: dfl: support multiple opens on feature device node.

Each DFL functional block, e.g. AFU (Accelerated Function Unit) and FME
(FPGA Management Engine), could implement more than one function within
its region, but current driver only allows one user application to access
it by exclusive open on device node. So this is not convenient and
flexible for userspace applications, as they have to combine lots of
different functions into one single application.

This patch removes the limitation here to allow multiple opens to each
feature device node for AFU and FME from userspace applications. If user
still needs exclusive access to these device node, O_EXCL flag must be
issued together with open.
