drm/i915: Enable non-contiguous pipe fusing

As we have already enabled supported infrastructure for
non-contiguous pipe fusing in driver, we don't require non-contiguous
pipe_mask check anymore.
It is an unlike condition, it make sense to remove this condition.

changes since RFC:
- using intel_pipe_mask_is_valid() function to check integrity of
  pipe_mask. [Ville]
v2:
- simplify condition in intel_pipe_mask_is_valid(). [Ville]
v3:
- removed non-contiguous pipe fusing check. [Lucas]
