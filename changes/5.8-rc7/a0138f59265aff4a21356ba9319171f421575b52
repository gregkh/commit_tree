s390/cio, s390/qeth: cleanup PNSO CHSC

CHSC3D (PNSO - perform network subchannel operation) is used for
OC0 (Store-network-bridging-information) as well as for
OC3 (Store-network-address-information). So common fields are renamed
from *brinfo* to *pnso*.
Also *_bridge_host_* is changed into *_addr_change_*, e.g.
qeth_bridge_host_event to qeth_addr_change_event, for the
same reasons.
The keywords in the card traces are changed accordingly.

Remove unused L3 types, as PNSO will only return Layer2 entries.

Make PNSO CHSC implementation more consistent with existing API usage:
Add new function ccw_device_pnso() to drivers/s390/cio/device_ops.c and
the function declaration to arch/s390/include/asm/ccwdev.h, which takes
a struct ccw_device * as parameter instead of schid and calls
chsc_pnso().

PNSO CHSC has no strict relationship to qdio. So move the calling
function from qdio to qeth_l2 and move the necessary structures to a
new file arch/s390/include/asm/chsc.h.

Do response code evaluation only in chsc_error_from_response() and
use return code in all other places. qeth_anset_makerc() was meant to
evaluate the PNSO response code, but never did, because pnso_rc was
already non-zero.

Indentation was corrected in some places.
