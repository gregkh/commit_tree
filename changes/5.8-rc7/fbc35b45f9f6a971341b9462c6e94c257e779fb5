Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER

Add a bit of documentation on what it means when a driver .probe() hook
returns the -EPROBE_DEFER error code, including the limitation that
-EPROBE_DEFER should be returned as early as possible, before the driver
starts to register child devices.

Also: minor markup fixes in the same file
