drm/i915/gt: Pin the rings before marking active

On eviction, we acquire the vm->mutex and then wait on the vma->active.
Therefore when binding and pinning the vma, we must follow the same
sequence, lock/pin the vma then mark it active. Otherwise, we mark the
vma as active, then wait for the vm->mutex, and meanwhile the evictor
holding the mutex waits upon us to complete our activity.
