drm/amd/display: Change infopacket type programming

[Why]
Certain displays may experience blanking if infopacket max range does
not equal nominal refresh rate.

[How]
Add additional infopacket versions to program range to full or forced
range in freesync states.
This does not change the vrr logic.
