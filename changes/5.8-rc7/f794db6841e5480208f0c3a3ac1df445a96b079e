virt: vbox: Fix VBGL_IOCTL_VMMDEV_REQUEST_BIG and _LOG req numbers to match upstream

Until this commit the mainline kernel version (this version) of the
vboxguest module contained a bug where it defined
VBGL_IOCTL_VMMDEV_REQUEST_BIG and VBGL_IOCTL_LOG using
_IOC(_IOC_READ | _IOC_WRITE, 'V', ...) instead of
_IO(V, ...) as the out of tree VirtualBox upstream version does.

Since the VirtualBox userspace bits are always built against VirtualBox
upstream's headers, this means that so far the mainline kernel version
of the vboxguest module has been failing these 2 ioctls with -ENOTTY.
I guess that VBGL_IOCTL_VMMDEV_REQUEST_BIG is never used causing us to
not hit that one and sofar the vboxguest driver has failed to actually
log any log messages passed it through VBGL_IOCTL_LOG.

This commit changes the VBGL_IOCTL_VMMDEV_REQUEST_BIG and VBGL_IOCTL_LOG
defines to match the out of tree VirtualBox upstream vboxguest version,
while keeping compatibility with the old wrong request defines so as
to not break the kernel ABI in case someone has been using the old
request defines.
