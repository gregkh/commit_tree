drm/i915: Only close vma we open

The history of i915_vma_close() is confusing, as is its use. As the
lifetime of the i915_vma is currently bounded by the object it is
attached to, we needed a means of identify when a vma was no longer in
use by userspace (via the user's fd). This is further complicated by
that only ppgtt vma should be closed at the user's behest, as the ggtt
were always shared.

Now that we attach the vma to a lut on the user's context, the open
count does indicate how many unique and open context/vm are referencing
this vma from the user. As such, we can and should just use the
open_count to track when the vma is still in use by userspace.

It's a poor man's replacement for reference counting.
