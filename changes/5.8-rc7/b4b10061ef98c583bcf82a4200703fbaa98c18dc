f2fs: refactor resize_fs to avoid meta updates in progress

Sahitya raised an issue:
- prevent meta updates while checkpoint is in progress

allocate_segment_for_resize() can cause metapage updates if
it requires to change the current node/data segments for resizing.
Stop these meta updates when there is a checkpoint already
in progress to prevent inconsistent CP data.
