block: move blk_io_schedule() out of header file

blk_io_schedule() isn't called from performance sensitive code path, and
it is easier to maintain by exporting it as symbol.

Also blk_io_schedule() is only called by CONFIG_BLOCK code, so it is safe
to do this way. Meantime fixes build failure when CONFIG_BLOCK is off.
