KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Take cpu_if pointer directly instead of vcpu

If we move the used_lrs field to the version-specific cpu interface
structure, the following functions only operate on the struct
vgic_v3_cpu_if and not the full vcpu:

  __vgic_v3_save_state
  __vgic_v3_restore_state
  __vgic_v3_activate_traps
  __vgic_v3_deactivate_traps
  __vgic_v3_save_aprs
  __vgic_v3_restore_aprs

This is going to be very useful for nested virt, so move the used_lrs
field and change the prototypes and implementations of these functions to
take the cpu_if parameter directly.

No functional change.
