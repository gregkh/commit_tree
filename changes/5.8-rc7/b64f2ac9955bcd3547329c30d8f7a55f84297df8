net: atlantic: change the order of arguments for TC weight/credit setters

This patch changes the order of arguments for TC weight/credit setter
functions.
Having the "value to be set" on the right is slightly more robust in
a sense that it's more natural for the humans, so it's a bit more
error-proof this way.
