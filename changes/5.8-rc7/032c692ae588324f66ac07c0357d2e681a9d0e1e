soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: read_tcs_reg()/write_tcs_reg() are not for IRQ

The RSC_DRV_IRQ_ENABLE, RSC_DRV_IRQ_STATUS, and RSC_DRV_IRQ_CLEAR
registers are not part of TCS 0.  Let's not pretend that they are by
using read_tcs_reg() and write_tcs_reg() and passing a bogus tcs_id of
0.  We could introduce a new wrapper for these registers but it
wouldn't buy us much.  Let's just read/write directly.
