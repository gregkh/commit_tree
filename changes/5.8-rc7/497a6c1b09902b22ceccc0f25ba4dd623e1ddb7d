mm: keep separate anon and file statistics on page reclaim activity

Having statistics on pages scanned and pages reclaimed for both anon and
file pages makes it easier to evaluate changes to LRU balancing.

While at it, clean up the stat-keeping mess for isolation, putback,
reclaim stats etc.  a bit: first the physical LRU operation (isolation and
putback), followed by vmstats, reclaim_stats, and then vm events.
