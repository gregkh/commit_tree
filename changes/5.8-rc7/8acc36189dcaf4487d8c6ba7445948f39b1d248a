ARM: dts: qcom: ipq4019: fix high resolution timer

Cherry-picked from CAF QSDK repo.
Original commit message:
The kernel is failing in switching the timer for high resolution
mode and clock source operates in 10ms resolution. The always-on
property needs to be given for timer device tree node to make
clock source working in 1ns resolution.
