arm64: cpufeature: Spell out register fields for ID_ISAR4 and ID_PFR1

In preparation for runtime updates to the strictness of some AArch32
features, spell out the register fields for ID_ISAR4 and ID_PFR1 to make
things clearer to read. Note that this isn't functionally necessary, as
the feature arrays themselves are not modified dynamically and remain
'const'.
