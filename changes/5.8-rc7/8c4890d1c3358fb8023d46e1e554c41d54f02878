smp, irq_work: Continue smp_call_function*() and irq_work*() integration

Instead of relying on BUG_ON() to ensure the various data structures
line up, use a bunch of horrible unions to make it all automatic.

Much of the union magic is to ensure irq_work and smp_call_function do
not (yet) see the members of their respective data structures change
name.
