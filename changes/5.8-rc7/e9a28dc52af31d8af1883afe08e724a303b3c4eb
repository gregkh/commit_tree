btrfs: rename tree_entry to rb_simple_node and export it

Structure tree_entry provides a very simple rb_tree which only uses
bytenr as search index.

That tree_entry is used in 3 structures: backref_node, mapping_node and
tree_block.

Since we're going to make backref_node independnt from relocation, it's
a good time to extract the tree_entry into rb_simple_node, and export it
into misc.h.
