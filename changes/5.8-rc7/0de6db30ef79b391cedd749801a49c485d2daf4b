ASoC: tegra: Use device managed resource APIs to get the clock

tegra_asoc_utils uses clk_get() to get the clock and clk_put() to free
them explicitly.

This patch updates it to use device managed resource API devm_clk_get()
so the clock will be automatically released and freed when the device is
unbound and removes tegra_asoc_utils_fini() as its no longer needed.
