usb: gadget: f_tcm: Inform last stream request

Set the request->is_last to each stream request to indicate that the
request is the last stream request of a transfer. The DWC3 controller
needs to know this info to properly switch streams. The current
implementation of f_tcm uses a single request per transfer, so every
stream request is the last of its stream.
