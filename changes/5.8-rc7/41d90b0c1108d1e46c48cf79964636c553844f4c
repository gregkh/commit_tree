efi/x86: Setup stack correctly for efi_pe_entry

Commit

  17054f492dfd ("efi/x86: Implement mixed mode boot without the handover protocol")

introduced a new entry point for the EFI stub to be booted in mixed mode
on 32-bit firmware.

When entered via efi32_pe_entry, control is first transferred to
startup_32 to setup for the switch to long mode, and then the EFI stub
proper is entered via efi_pe_entry. efi_pe_entry is an MS ABI function,
and the ABI requires 32 bytes of shadow stack space to be allocated by
the caller, as well as the stack being aligned to 8 mod 16 on entry.

Allocate 40 bytes on the stack before switching to 64-bit mode when
calling efi_pe_entry to account for this.

For robustness, explicitly align boot_stack_end to 16 bytes. It is
currently implicitly aligned since .bss is cacheline-size aligned,
head_64.o is the first object file with a .bss section, and the heap and
boot sizes are aligned.
