xfs: remove unnecessary variable udqp from xfs_ioctl_setattr

The initial value of variable udqp is NULL, and we only set the
flag XFS_QMOPT_PQUOTA in xfs_qm_vop_dqalloc() function, so only
the pdqp value is initialized and the udqp value is still NULL.
Since the udqp value is NULL in the rest part of xfs_ioctl_setattr()
function, it is meaningless and do nothing. So remove it from
xfs_ioctl_setattr().
