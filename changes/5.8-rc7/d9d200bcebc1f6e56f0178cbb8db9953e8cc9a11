dma-mapping: add generic helpers for mapping sgtable objects

struct sg_table is a common structure used for describing a memory
buffer. It consists of a scatterlist with memory pages and DMA addresses
(sgl entry), as well as the number of scatterlist entries: CPU pages
(orig_nents entry) and DMA mapped pages (nents entry).

It turned out that it was a common mistake to misuse nents and orig_nents
entries, calling DMA-mapping functions with a wrong number of entries or
ignoring the number of mapped entries returned by the dma_map_sg
function.

To avoid such issues, let's introduce a common wrappers operating
directly on the struct sg_table objects, which take care of the proper
use of the nents and orig_nents entries.
