mm: memcontrol: prepare uncharging for removal of private page type counters

The uncharge batching code adds up the anon, file, kmem counts to
determine the total number of pages to uncharge and references to drop.
But the next patches will remove the anon and file counters.

Maintain an aggregate nr_pages in the uncharge_gather struct.
