dm zoned: Fix zone reclaim trigger

Only triggering reclaim based on the percentage of unmapped cache
zones can fail to detect cases where reclaim is needed, e.g. if the
target has only 2 or 3 cache zones and only one unmapped cache zone,
the percentage of free cache zones is higher than
DMZ_RECLAIM_LOW_UNMAP_ZONES (30%) and reclaim does not trigger.

This problem, combined with the fact that dmz_schedule_reclaim() is
called from dmz_handle_bio() without the map lock held, leads to a
race between zone allocation and dmz_should_reclaim() result.
Depending on the workload applied, this race can lead to the write
path waiting forever for a free zone without reclaim being triggered.

Fix this by moving dmz_schedule_reclaim() inside dmz_alloc_zone()
under the map lock. This results in checking the need for zone reclaim
whenever a new data or buffer zone needs to be allocated.

Also fix dmz_reclaim_percentage() to always return 0 if the number of
unmapped cache (or random) zones is less than or equal to 1.
