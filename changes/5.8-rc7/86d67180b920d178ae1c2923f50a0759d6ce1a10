perf thread-stack: Add branch stack support

Intel PT already has support for creating branch stacks for each context
(per-cpu or per-thread). In the more common per-cpu case, the branch stack
is not separated for different threads, instead being cleared in between
each sample.

That approach will not work very well for adding branch stacks to
regular events. The branch stacks really need to be accumulated
separately for each thread.

As a start to accomplishing that, this patch adds support for putting
branch stack support into the thread-stack. The advantages are:

1. the branches are accumulated separately for each thread
2. the branch stack is cleared only in between continuous traces

This helps pave the way for adding branch stacks to regular events, not
just synthesized events as at present.
