x86/idt: Keep spurious entries unset in system_vectors

With commit dc20b2d52653 ("x86/idt: Move interrupt gate initialization to
IDT code") non assigned system vectors are also marked as used in
'used_vectors' (now 'system_vectors') bitmap. This makes checks in
arch_show_interrupts() whether a particular system vector is allocated to
always pass and e.g. 'Hyper-V reenlightenment interrupts' entry always
shows up in /proc/interrupts.

Another side effect of having all unassigned system vectors marked as used
is that irq_matrix_debug_show() will wrongly count them among 'System'
vectors.

As it is now ensured that alloc_intr_gate() is not called after init, it is
possible to leave unused entries in 'system_vectors' unset to fix these
issues.
