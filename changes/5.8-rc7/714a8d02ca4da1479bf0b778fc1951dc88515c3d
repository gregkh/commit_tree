arm64: asm: Override SYM_FUNC_START when building the kernel with BTI

When the kernel is built for BTI override SYM_FUNC_START and related macros
to add a BTI landing pad to the start of all global functions, ensuring that
they are BTI safe. The ; at the end of the BTI_x macros is for the
benefit of the macro-generated functions in xen-hypercall.S.
