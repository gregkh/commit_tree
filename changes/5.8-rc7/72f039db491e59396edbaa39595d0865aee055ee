phy: qcom-qmp: Ensure register indirection arrays initialized

It's possible that struct qmp_phy_cfg->regs references an array that is
smaller than the possible register lookups that is going to be
performed, with the resulting out-of-bounds read resulting in undefined
behavior.

One such example is when during qcom_qmp_phy_com_init() performs a
qphy_setbits() on entry QPHY_PCS_POWER_DOWN_CONTROL (i.e. 17) with
msm8996_ufsphy_regs_layout only being 12 entries long.

Solve this by inflating all "regs_layout" arrays to ensure that any
remaining entries are zero-initialized, as expected by the code.
