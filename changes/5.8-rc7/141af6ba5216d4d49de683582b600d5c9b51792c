f2fs: fix long latency due to discard during umount

F2FS already has a default timeout of 5 secs for discards that
can be issued during umount, but it can take more than the 5 sec
timeout if the underlying UFS device queue is already full and there
are no more available free tags to be used. Fix this by submitting a
small batch of discard requests so that it won't cause the device
queue to be full at any time and thus doesn't incur its wait time
in the umount context.
