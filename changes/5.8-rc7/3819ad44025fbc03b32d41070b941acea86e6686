ARM: mmp: Remove legacy clk code

Remove all the legacy clk code that supports a non-common clk framework
implementation of 'struct clk' in mach-mmp. This code doesn't look to be
compiled anymore given that the MMP is fully supported in the
multi-platform config via ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM as of commit 377524dc4d77
("ARM: mmp: move into ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM"). The ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
config selects COMMON_CLK and therefore the Makefile rule can never
actually compile the code in these files.
