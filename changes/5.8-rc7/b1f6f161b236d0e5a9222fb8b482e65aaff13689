printk: honor the max_reason field in kmsg_dumper

kmsg_dump() allows to dump kmesg buffer for various system events: oops,
panic, reboot, etc. It provides an interface to register a callback
call for clients, and in that callback interface there is a field
"max_reason", but it was getting ignored when set to any "reason"
higher than KMSG_DUMP_OOPS unless "always_kmsg_dump" was passed as
kernel parameter.

Allow clients to actually control their "max_reason", and keep the
current behavior when "max_reason" is not set.
