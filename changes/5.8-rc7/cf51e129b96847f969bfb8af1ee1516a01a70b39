sparc32: fix register window handling in genregs32_[gs]et()

It needs access_process_vm() if the traced process does not share
mm with the caller.  Solution is similar to what sparc64 does.
Note that genregs32_set() is only ever called with pos being 0
or 32 * sizeof(u32) (the latter - as part of PTRACE_SETREGS
handling).
