ceph: ceph_kick_flushing_caps needs the s_mutex

The mdsc->cap_dirty_lock is not held while walking the list in
ceph_kick_flushing_caps, which is not safe.

ceph_early_kick_flushing_caps does something similar, but the
s_mutex is held while it's called and I think that guards against
changes to the list.

Ensure we hold the s_mutex when calling ceph_kick_flushing_caps,
and add some clarifying comments.
