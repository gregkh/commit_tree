powerpc: Add POWER10 architected mode

PVR value of 0x0F000006 means we are arch v3.1 compliant (i.e.
POWER10). This is used by phyp and kvm when booting as a pseries guest
to detect the presence of new P10 features and to enable the
appropriate hwcap and facility bits.

[mpe: Fall through to __init_FSCR rather than duplicating it, drop
      hack to set current->thread.fscr now that is handled elsewhere.]
