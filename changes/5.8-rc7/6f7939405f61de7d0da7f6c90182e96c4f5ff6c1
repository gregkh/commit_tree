mm: swapfile: fix /proc/swaps heading and Size/Used/Priority alignment

Fix the heading and Size/Used/Priority field alignments in /proc/swaps.
If the Size and/or Used value is >= 10000000 (8 bytes), then the
alignment by using tab characters is broken.

This patch maintains the use of tabs for alignment.  If spaces are
preferred, we can just use a Field Width specifier for the bytes and
inuse fields.  That way those fields don't have to be a multiple of 8
bytes in width.  E.g., with a field width of 12, both Size and Used
would always fit on the first line of an 80-column wide terminal (only
Priority would be on the second line).

There are actually 2 problems: heading alignment and field width.  On an
xterm, if Used is 7 bytes in length, the tab does nothing, and the
display is like this, with no space/tab between the Used and Priority
fields.  (ugh)

Filename				Type		Size	Used	Priority
/dev/sda8                               partition	16779260	2023012-1

To be clear, if one does 'cat /proc/swaps >/tmp/proc.swaps', it does look
different, like so:

Filename				Type		Size	Used	Priority
/dev/sda8                               partition	16779260	2086988	-1
