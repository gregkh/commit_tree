net: ipa: only reset channel twice for IPA v3.5.1

In gsi_channel_reset(), RX channels are subjected to two consecutive
CHANNEL_RESET commands.  This workaround should only be used for IPA
version 3.5.1, and for newer hardware "can lead to unwanted behavior."

Only issue the second CHANNEL_RESET command for legacy hardware.
