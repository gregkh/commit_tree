iwlwifi: dbg_ini: differentiate ax210 hw with same hw type

There are several "flavors" of HW that have the same HW type, but
can be told apart after reading a certain perph register. This
is easy to do in runtime, but more complicated to do when looking
at the logs offline.

To make it easier to tell apart these "flavors" when looking at
the dumped dbg info, add these bits to the HW type, allowing
simple differentiation.
