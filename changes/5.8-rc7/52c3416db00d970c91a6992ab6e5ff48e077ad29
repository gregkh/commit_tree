modpost: track if the symbol origin is a dump file or ELF object

The meaning of sym->kernel is obscure; it is set for in-kernel symbols
loaded from Modules.symvers. This happens only when we are building
external modules, and it is used to determine whether to dump symbols
to $(KBUILD_EXTMOD)/Modules.symvers

It is clearer to remember whether the symbol or module came from a dump
file or ELF object.

This changes the KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS behavior. Previously, symbols
loaded from KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS are accumulated into the current
$(KBUILD_EXTMOD)/Modules.symvers

Going forward, they will be only used to check symbol references, but
not dumped into the current $(KBUILD_EXTMOD)/Modules.symvers. I believe
this makes more sense.

sym->vmlinux will have no user. Remove it too.
