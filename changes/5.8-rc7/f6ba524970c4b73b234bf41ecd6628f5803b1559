platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Split keymap into buttons and switches parts

Split the sparse keymap into 2 separate keymaps, a buttons and a switches
keymap and combine the 2 to a single map again in intel_vbtn_input_setup().

This is a preparation patch for not telling userspace that we have switches
when we do not have them (and for doing the same for the buttons).
