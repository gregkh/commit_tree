net: qed: fixes crash while running driver in kdump kernel

This fixes a crash introduced by recent is_kdump_kernel() check.
The source of the crash is that kdump kernel can be loaded on a
system with already created VFs. But for such VFs, it will follow
a logic path of PF and eventually crash.

Thus, we are partially reverting back previous changes and instead
use is_kdump_kernel is a single init point of PF init, where we
disable SRIOV explicitly.
