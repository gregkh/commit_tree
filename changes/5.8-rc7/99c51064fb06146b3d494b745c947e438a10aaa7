devmap: Use bpf_map_area_alloc() for allocating hash buckets

Syzkaller discovered that creating a hash of type devmap_hash with a large
number of entries can hit the memory allocator limit for allocating
contiguous memory regions. There's really no reason to use kmalloc_array()
directly in the devmap code, so just switch it to the existing
bpf_map_area_alloc() function that is used elsewhere.
