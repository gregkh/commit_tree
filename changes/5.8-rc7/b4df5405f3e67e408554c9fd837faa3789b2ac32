drm/i915: Extend hotplug detect retry on TypeC connectors to 5 seconds

On TypeC ports if a sink deasserts/reasserts its HPD signal, generating
a hotplug interrupt without the sink getting unplugged/replugged from
the connector, there can be an up to 3 seconds delay until the AUX
channel gets functional. To avoid detection failures this delay causes
retry the detection for 5 seconds.

I noticed this on ICL/TGL RVPs and a DELL XPS 13 7390 ICL laptop.
