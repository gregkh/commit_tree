btrfs: simplify root lookup by id

The main function to lookup a root by its id btrfs_get_fs_root takes the
whole key, while only using the objectid. The value of offset is preset
to (u64)-1 but not actually used until btrfs_find_root that does the
actual search.

Switch btrfs_get_fs_root to use only objectid and remove all local
variables that existed just for the lookup. The actual key for search is
set up in btrfs_get_fs_root, reusing another key variable.
