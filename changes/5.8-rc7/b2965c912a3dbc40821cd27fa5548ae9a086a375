media: dt-bindings: media: rockchip-rga: add power-domains property

In the old txt situation we add/describe only properties that are used
by the driver/hardware itself. With yaml it also filters things in a
node that are used by other drivers like 'power-domains' for rk3399,
so add it to 'rockchip-rga.yaml'.
