ASoC: fsl_ssi: Fix bclk calculation for mono channel

For mono channel, SSI will switch to Normal mode.

In Normal mode and Network mode, the Word Length Control bits
control the word length divider in clock generator, which is
different with I2S Master mode (the word length is fixed to
32bit), it should be the value of params_width(hw_params).

The condition "slots == 2" is not good for I2S Master mode,
because for Network mode and Normal mode, the slots can also
be 2. Then we need to use (ssi->i2s_net & SSI_SCR_I2S_MODE_MASK)
to check if it is I2S Master mode.

So we refine the formula for mono channel, otherwise there
will be sound issue for S24_LE.
