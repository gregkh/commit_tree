tty: n_gsm: Fix SOF skipping

For at least some modems like the TELIT LE910, skipping SOF makes
transfers blocking indefinitely after a short amount of data
transferred.

Given the small improvement provided by skipping the SOF (just one
byte on about 100 bytes), it seems better to completely remove this
"feature" than make it optional.
