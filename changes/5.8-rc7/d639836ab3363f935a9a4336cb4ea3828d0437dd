net: qed: adding hw_err states and handling

Here we introduce qed device error tracking flags and error types.

qed_hw_err_notify is an entrace point to report errors.
It'll notify higher level drivers (qede/qedr/etc) to handle and recover
the error.

List of posible errors comes from hardware interfaces, but could be
extended in future.
