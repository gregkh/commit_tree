drm: Include the encoder itself in possible_clones

The docs say possible_clones should always include the encoder itself.
Since most drivers don't want to deal with the complexities of cloning
let's allow them to set possible_clones=0 and instead we'll fix that
up in the core.

We can't put this special case into drm_encoder_init() because drivers
will have to fill up possible_clones after adding all the relevant
encoders. Otherwise they wouldn't know the proper encoder indexes to
use. So we'll just do it just before registering the device.

v2: Don't set the bit if possible_clones!=0 so that the
    validation (coming soon) will WARN (Thomas)
    Fix up the docs to allow possible_clones==0 (Daniel)
    .late_register() is too late, introduce drm_mode_config_validate()
    which gets called _before_ we register the char device (Daniel)
