PCI: aardvark: Add PHY support

With recent proposed changes for U-Boot it is possible that bootloader
won't initialize the PHY for this controller (currently the PHY is
initialized regardless whether PCI is used in U-Boot, but with these
proposed changes the PHY is initialized only on request).

Since the mvebu-a3700-comphy driver by Miquèl Raynal supports enabling
PCIe PHY, and since Linux' functionality should be independent on what
bootloader did, add code for enabling generic PHY if found in device OF
node.

The mvebu-a3700-comphy driver does PHY powering via SMC calls to ARM
Trusted Firmware. The corresponding code in ARM Trusted Firmware skips
one register write which U-Boot does not: step 7 ("Enable TX"), see [1].
Instead ARM Trusted Firmware expects PCIe driver to do this step,
probably because the register is in PCIe controller address space,
instead of PHY address space. We therefore add this step into the
advk_pcie_setup_hw function.
