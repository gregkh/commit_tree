dt-bindings: display: rockchip-vop: add additional properties

In the old txt situation we add/describe only properties that are used
by the driver/hardware itself. With yaml it also filters things in a
node that are used by other drivers like 'assigned-clocks' and
'assigned-clock-rates' for rk3399 and 'power-domains' for most
Rockchip Socs in 'vop' nodes, so add them to 'rockchip-vop.yaml'.
