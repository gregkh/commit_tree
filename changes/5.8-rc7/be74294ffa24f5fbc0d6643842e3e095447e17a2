net: get rid of lockdep_set_class_and_subclass()

lockdep_set_class_and_subclass() is meant to reduce
the _nested() annotations by assigning a default subclass.
For addr_list_lock, we have to compute the subclass at
run-time as the netdevice topology changes after creation.

So, we should just get rid of these
lockdep_set_class_and_subclass() and stick with our _nested()
annotations.
