iwlwifi: pcie: allocate much smaller byte-count table

The hardware needs a byte-count table with the size of each frame
on the queue to build A-MPDUs, but:
 * newer generation no longer have the duplicated space at the end,
   they can deal with the wrap properly - and we don't even fill
   the dup anyway
 * we have a maximum queue size of 512 right now and don't use the
   theoretical hardware maximum of 65536.

Together, this reduces the byte count table DMA allocation from
64KiB (65536*2 + 64*2 rounded up) to 1 KiB (though that might be
rounded up to a full 4 KiB page by the allocator, not sure it can
share the allocations.)
