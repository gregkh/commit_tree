floppy: add defines for sizes of cmd & reply buffers of floppy_raw_cmd

Use FD_RAW_CMD_SIZE, FD_RAW_REPLY_SIZE defines instead of magic numbers
for cmd & reply buffers of struct floppy_raw_cmd. Remove local to
floppy.c MAX_REPLIES define, as it is now FD_RAW_REPLY_SIZE.
FD_RAW_CMD_FULLSIZE added as we allow command to also fill reply_count
and reply fields.
