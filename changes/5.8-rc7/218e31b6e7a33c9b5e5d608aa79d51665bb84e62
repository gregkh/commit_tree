x86/traps: Prepare for using DEFINE_IDTENTRY

Prepare for using IDTENTRY to define the C exception/trap entry points. It
would be possible to glue this into the existing macro maze, but it's
simpler and better to read at the end to just make them distinct.

Provide a trivial inline helper to read the trap address and add a comment
explaining the logic behind it.

The existing macros will be removed once all instances are converted.
