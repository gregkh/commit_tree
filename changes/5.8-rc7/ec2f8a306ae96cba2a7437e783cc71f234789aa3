habanalabs: define ASIC-dependent interface for signal/wait

This feature requires handling h/w resources which are a bit different from
one ASIC to the other. Therefore, we need to define a set of interfaces the
ASIC code provides to the common code to signal, wait, reset sync object
and to reset and init a queue.

As this feature is not supported in Goya, provide an empty implementation
of those functions.
