efi/libstub/arm64: Switch to ordinary page allocator for kernel image

It is no longer necessary to locate the kernel as low as possible in
physical memory, and so we can switch from efi_low_alloc() [which is
a rather nasty concoction on top of GetMemoryMap()] to a new helper
called efi_allocate_pages_aligned(), which simply rounds up the size
to account for the alignment, and frees the misaligned pages again.

So considering that the kernel can live anywhere in the physical
address space, as long as its alignment requirements are met, let's
switch to efi_allocate_pages_aligned() to allocate the pages.
