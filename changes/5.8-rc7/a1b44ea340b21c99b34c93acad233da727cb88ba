tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Add 51.2MHz frequency support

To support BT use case over UART at baud rate of 3.2 Mbps,
we need SE clocks to run at 51.2MHz frequency. Previously this
frequency was not available in clk src, so, we were requesting
for 102.4 MHz and dividing it internally by 2 to get 51.2MHz.

As now 51.2MHz frequency is made available in clk src,
adding this frequency to UART frequency table.

We will save significant amount of power, if 51.2 is used
because it belongs to LowSVS range whereas 102.4 fall into
Nominal category.
