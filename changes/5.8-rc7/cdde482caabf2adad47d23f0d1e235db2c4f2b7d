drm/amd/display: Refactor color management to take dm plane state

[Why]
- In amdgpu_dm_update_plane_color_mgmt() it is inconsistent in taking in
dm_crtc_state and dc_plane_state.
- Makes supporting plane-level color management with proper guard more
complicated than necessary.

[How]
Pass in dm_plane_state in place of dc_plane_state in
amdgpu_dm_update_plane_color_mgmt().
