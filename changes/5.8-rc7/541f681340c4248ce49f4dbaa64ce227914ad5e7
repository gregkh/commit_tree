media: atomisp: Remove unnecessary NULL check in atomisp_param

Clang warns:

drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp_cmd.c:4278:17: warning:
address of 'config->info' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
                if (!&config->info) {
                    ~ ~~~~~~~~^~~~

config cannot be NULL because it comes from an ioctl, which ensures that
the user is not giving us an invalid pointer through copy_from_user. If
config is not NULL, info cannot be NULL. Remove this check.
