net: ethernet: mvneta: fix MVNETA_SKB_HEADROOM alignment

Commit ca23cb0bc50f ("mvneta: MVNETA_SKB_HEADROOM set last 3 bits to zero")
added headroom alignment check against 8.
Hovewer (if we imagine that NET_SKB_PAD or XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM is not
aligned to cacheline size), it actually aligns headroom down, while
skb/xdp_buff headroom should be *at least* equal to one of the values
(depending on XDP prog presence).
So, fix the check to align the value up. This satisfies both
hardware/driver and network stack requirements.
