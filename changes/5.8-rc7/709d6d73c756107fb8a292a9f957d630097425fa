scatterlist: add generic wrappers for iterating over sgtable objects

struct sg_table is a common structure used for describing a memory
buffer. It consists of a scatterlist with memory pages and DMA addresses
(sgl entry), as well as the number of scatterlist entries: CPU pages
(orig_nents entry) and DMA mapped pages (nents entry).

It turned out that it was a common mistake to misuse nents and orig_nents
entries, calling the scatterlist iterating functions with a wrong number
of the entries.

To avoid such issues, lets introduce a common wrappers operating directly
on the struct sg_table objects, which take care of the proper use of
the nents and orig_nents entries.

While touching this, lets clarify some ambiguities in the comments for
the existing for_each helpers.
