arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Disable coresight by default

On some msm8916 devices, attempts at initializing coresight cause the boot to
fail. This was fixed by disabling the coresight-related nodes in the board dts
files. However, a cleaner approach was chosen for fixing the same issue on
msm8998: disabling coresight by default, and enabling it in board dts files
where desired.

This patch implements the same solution for msm8916, removes now redundant
overwrites in board specific dts files and and enables coresight in db410c's
board dts in order to keep the current behavior.
