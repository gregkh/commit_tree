phy: amlogic: meson8b-usb2: Don't set REG_ADP_BC_ACA_ENABLE on Meson8

Skip setting REG_ADP_BC_ACA_ENABLE on Meson8 SoCs and polling for the
REG_ADP_BC_ACA_PIN_FLOAT bit. The vendor also skips this part on Meson8
SoCs.
This fixes initialization of the host-only USB PHY on Meson8 which would
otherwise fail with "USB ID detect failed!".
