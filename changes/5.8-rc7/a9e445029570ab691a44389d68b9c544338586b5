net/smc: fix dmb buffer shortage

There is a current limit of 1920 registered dmb buffers per ISM device
for smc-d. One link group can contain 255 connections, each connection
is using one dmb buffer. When the connection is closed then the
registered buffer is held in a queue and is reused by the next
connection. When a link group is 'full' then another link group is
created and uses an own buffer pool. The link groups are added to a
list using list_add() which puts a new link group to the first position
in the list.
In the situation that many connections are opened (>1920) and a few of
them stay open while others are closed quickly we end up with at least 8
link groups. For a new connection a matching link group is looked up,
iterating over the list of link groups. The trailing 7 link groups
all have registered dmb buffers which could be reused, while the first
link group has only a few dmb buffers and then hit the 1920 limit.
Because the first link group is not full (255 connection limit not
reached) it is chosen and finally the connection falls back to TCP
because there is no dmb buffer available in this link group.
There are multiple ways to fix that: using list_add_tail() allows
to scan older link groups first for free buffers which ensures that
buffers are reused first. This fixes the problem for smc-r link groups
as well. For smc-d there is an even better way to address this problem
because smc-d does not have the 255 connections per link group limit.
So fix the problem for smc-d by allowing large link groups.
