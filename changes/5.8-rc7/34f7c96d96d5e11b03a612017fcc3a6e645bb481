objtool: Optimize !vmlinux.o again

When doing kbuild tests to see if the objtool changes affected those I
found that there was a measurable regression:

          pre		  post

  real    1m13.594        1m16.488s
  user    34m58.246s      35m23.947s
  sys     4m0.393s        4m27.312s

Perf showed that for small files the increased hash-table sizes were a
measurable difference. Since we already have -l "vmlinux" to
distinguish between the modes, make it also use a smaller portion of
the hash-tables.

This flips it into a small win:

  real    1m14.143s
  user    34m49.292s
  sys     3m44.746s
