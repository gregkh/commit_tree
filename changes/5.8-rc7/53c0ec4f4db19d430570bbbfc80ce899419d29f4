ne2k-pci: Fix various coding-style issues and improve printk() usage

Fixed a ton of minor checkpatch errors/warnings and remove version
printing at module init/when device is found and use MODULE_VERSION
instead. Also modifying the RTL8029 PCI string to include the compatible
RTL8029AS nic.
The only mayor issue remaining is the missing SPDX tag, but since the
exact version of the GPL is not stated anywhere inside the file, its
impossible to add such a tag at the moment.
But maybe it is possible, since 8390.h states Donald Becker's 8390
drivers are licensed under GPL 2.2 only (= GPL-2.0-only ?).
The kernel module containing this patch compiles and runs without
problems on a RTL8029AS-based NE2000 clone card with kernel 5.7.0-rc6.
