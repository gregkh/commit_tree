ipc/namespace.c: use a work queue to free_ipc

the reason is to avoid a delay caused by the synchronize_rcu() call in
kern_umount() when the mqueue mount is freed.

the code:

    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <sched.h>
    #include <error.h>
    #include <errno.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main()
    {
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
            if (unshare(CLONE_NEWIPC) < 0)
                error(EXIT_FAILURE, errno, "unshare");
    }
