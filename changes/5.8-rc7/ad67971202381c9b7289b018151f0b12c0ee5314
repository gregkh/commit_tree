iio: adc: ad9467: add support AD9467 ADC

The AD9467 is a 16-bit, monolithic, IF sampling analog-to-digital converter
(ADC). It is optimized for high performanceover wide bandwidths and ease of
use. The product operates at a 250 MSPS conversion rate and is designed for
wireless receivers, instrumentation, and test equipment that require a high
dynamic range. The ADC requires 1.8 V and 3.3 V power supplies and a low
voltage differential input clock for full performance operation. No
external reference or driver components are required for many applications.
Data outputs are LVDS compatible (ANSI-644 compatible) and include the
means to reduce the overall current needed for short trace distances.

Since the chip can operate at such high sample-rates (much higher than
classical interfaces), it requires that a DMA controller be used to
interface directly to the chip and push data into memory.
Typically, the AXI ADC IP core is used to interface with it.
