ima: Call ima_calc_boot_aggregate() in ima_eventdigest_init()

If the template field 'd' is chosen and the digest to be added to the
measurement entry was not calculated with SHA1 or MD5, it is
recalculated with SHA1, by using the passed file descriptor. However, this
cannot be done for boot_aggregate, because there is no file descriptor.

This patch adds a call to ima_calc_boot_aggregate() in
ima_eventdigest_init(), so that the digest can be recalculated also for the
boot_aggregate entry.
