riscv: kasan: use local_tlb_flush_all() to avoid uninitialized __sbi_rfence

It fails to boot the v5.8-rc4 kernel with CONFIG_KASAN because kasan_init
and kasan_early_init use uninitialized __sbi_rfence as executing the
tlb_flush_all(). Actually, at this moment, only the CPU which is
responsible for the system initialization enables the MMU. Other CPUs are
parking at the .Lsecondary_start. Hence the tlb_flush_all() is able to be
replaced by local_tlb_flush_all() to avoid using uninitialized
__sbi_rfence.
