block/bio-integrity: don't free 'buf' if bio_integrity_add_page() failed

commit e7bf90e5afe3 ("block/bio-integrity: fix a memory leak bug") added
a kfree() for 'buf' if bio_integrity_add_page() returns '0'. However,
the object will be freed in bio_integrity_free() since 'bio->bi_opf' and
'bio->bi_integrity' were set previousy in bio_integrity_alloc().
