platform/x86: Add Elkhart Lake SCU/PMC support

Intel Elkhart Lake exposes SCU/PMC as an ACPI device that only supports
IPC functionality so add a platform driver supporting it. Interrupt is
optional so we let intel_scu_ipc_probe() to decide based on the passed
platform data whether it uses interrupt or polling.
