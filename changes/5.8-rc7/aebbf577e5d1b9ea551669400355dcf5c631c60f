sdhci: tegra: Avoid reading autocal timeout values when not applicable

When auto calibration timeouts, calibration is disabled and fail-safe
drive strength values are programmed based on the signal voltage.

Different fail-safe drive strength values based on voltage are
applicable only for SoCs supporting 3V3 and 1V8 pad controls.

So, this patch avoids reading these properties from the device tree
for SoCs not using pad controls and the warning of missing properties
will not show up on these SoC platforms.
