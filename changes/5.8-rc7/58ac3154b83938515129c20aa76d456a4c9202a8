x86/entry: Actually disable stack protector

Some builds of GCC enable stack protector by default. Simply removing
the arguments is not sufficient to disable stack protector, as the stack
protector for those GCC builds must be explicitly disabled. Remove the
argument removals and add -fno-stack-protector. Additionally include
missed x32 argument updates, and adjust whitespace for readability.
