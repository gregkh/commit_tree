powerpc/kasan: Remove unnecessary page table locking

Commit 45ff3c559585 ("powerpc/kasan: Fix parallel loading of
modules.") added spinlocks to manage parallele module loading.

Since then commit 47febbeeec44 ("powerpc/32: Force KASAN_VMALLOC for
modules") converted the module loading to KASAN_VMALLOC.

The spinlocking has then become unneeded and can be removed to
simplify kasan_init_shadow_page_tables()

Also remove inclusion of linux/moduleloader.h and linux/vmalloc.h
which are not needed anymore since the removal of modules management.
