ath10k: enable VHT160 and VHT80+80 modes

Set right channel frequencies in VHT160 mode according to the VHT160
interoperability workaround added as part of IEEE Std 802.11™-2016 in
"Table 9-252—VHT Operation Information subfields", band_center_freq2
corresponds to CCFS1 in Table 9-253. Previous implementation
(band_center_freq2 = 0 for VHT160) is only deprecated.

Enable VHT80+80 mode and set the proper peer RX nss value for VHT160 and
VHT80+80 mode.
