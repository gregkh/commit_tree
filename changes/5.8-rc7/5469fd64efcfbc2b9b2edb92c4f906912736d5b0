usb: gadget: Introduce usb_request->is_last

To take advantage of DWC3 internal TRB prefetch and cache for
performance, inform the controller the last request with stream_id
before switching to a different stream transfer. This allows the
controller to maintain its transfer burst within the stream ID.

Introduce the usb-request is_last field to help inform the DWC3
controller of this.
