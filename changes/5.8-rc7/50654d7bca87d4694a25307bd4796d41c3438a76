drm/amdgpu/smu10: remove duplicate assignment of smu10_hwmgr_funcs members

The struct member 'asic_setup' was assigned twice, let's remove one:

static const struct pp_hwmgr_func smu10_hwmgr_funcs = {
	......
	.asic_setup = NULL,
	......
	.asic_setup = smu10_setup_asic_task,
	......
};

This fixes the following coccicheck warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/powerplay/hwmgr/smu10_hwmgr.c:1357:52-53:
asic_setup: first occurrence line 1360, second occurrence line 1388
