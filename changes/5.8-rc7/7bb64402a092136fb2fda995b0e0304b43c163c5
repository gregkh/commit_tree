spi: tools: Add macro definitions to fix build errors

Add SPI_TX_OCTAL and SPI_RX_OCTAL to fix the following build errors:

CC       spidev_test.o
spidev_test.c: In function ‘transfer’:
spidev_test.c:131:13: error: ‘SPI_TX_OCTAL’ undeclared (first use in this function)
  if (mode & SPI_TX_OCTAL)
             ^
spidev_test.c:131:13: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
spidev_test.c:137:13: error: ‘SPI_RX_OCTAL’ undeclared (first use in this function)
  if (mode & SPI_RX_OCTAL)
             ^
spidev_test.c: In function ‘parse_opts’:
spidev_test.c:290:12: error: ‘SPI_TX_OCTAL’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    mode |= SPI_TX_OCTAL;
            ^
spidev_test.c:308:12: error: ‘SPI_RX_OCTAL’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    mode |= SPI_RX_OCTAL;
            ^
  LD       spidev_test-in.o
ld: cannot find spidev_test.o: No such file or directory

Additionally, maybe SPI_CS_WORD and SPI_3WIRE_HIZ will be used in the future,
so add them too.
