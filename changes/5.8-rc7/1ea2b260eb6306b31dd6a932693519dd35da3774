drm/amdgpu: Re-enable FRU check for most models v5

There is at least 1 VG20 DID that does not have an FRU, and trying to read
that will cause a hang. For now, explicitly support reading the FRU for
Arcturus and for the WKS VG20 DIDs, and skip for everything else.
This re-enables serial number reporting for server cards

v2: Add ASIC check
v3: Don't default to true for pre-VG20
v4: Use DID instead of parsing the VBIOS
v5: Sqaush in overflow warning fix
