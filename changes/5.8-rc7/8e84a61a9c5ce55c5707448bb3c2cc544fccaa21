cifs: dump Security Type info in DebugData

Currently the end user is unaware with what sec type the
cifs share is mounted if no sec=<type> option is parsed.
With this patch one can easily check from DebugData.

Example:
1) Name: x.x.x.x Uses: 1 Capability: 0x8001f3fc	Session Status: 1 Security type: RawNTLMSSP
