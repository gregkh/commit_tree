ASoC: max9867: don't use regmap defaults

MAX9867 codec doesn't have reset pin, so the registers don't
have default values in the case of reboot without powering off.
Remove the reg_defaults struct and let the regmap read initial
state of the registers at startup instead of taking them from
reg_defaults struct.
