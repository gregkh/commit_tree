powerpc/32: Disable KASAN with pages bigger than 16k

Mapping of early shadow area is implemented by using a single static
page table having all entries pointing to the same early shadow page.
The shadow area must therefore occupy full PGD entries.

The shadow area has a size of 128MB starting at 0xf8000000.
With 4k pages, a PGD entry is 4MB
With 16k pages, a PGD entry is 64MB
With 64k pages, a PGD entry is 1GB which is too big.

Until we rework the early shadow mapping, disable KASAN when the page
size is too big.
