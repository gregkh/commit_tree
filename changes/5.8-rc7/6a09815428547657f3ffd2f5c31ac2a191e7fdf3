samples/bpf: xdp_redirect_cpu: Set MAX_CPUS according to NR_CPUS

xdp_redirect_cpu is currently failing in bpf_prog_load_xattr()
allocating cpu_map map if CONFIG_NR_CPUS is less than 64 since
cpu_map_alloc() requires max_entries to be less than NR_CPUS.
Set cpu_map max_entries according to NR_CPUS in xdp_redirect_cpu_kern.c
and get currently running cpus in xdp_redirect_cpu_user.c
