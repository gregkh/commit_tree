ACPI: GED: add support for _Exx / _Lxx handler methods

Per the ACPI spec, interrupts in the range [0, 255] may be handled
in AML using individual methods whose naming is based on the format
_Exx or _Lxx, where xx is the hex representation of the interrupt
index.

Add support for this missing feature to our ACPI GED driver.
