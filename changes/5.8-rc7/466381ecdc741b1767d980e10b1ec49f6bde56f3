powerpc/eeh: Release EEH device state synchronously

EEH device state is currently removed (by eeh_remove_device()) during
the device release handler, which is invoked as the device's reference
count drops to zero. This may take some time, or forever, as other
threads may hold references.

However, the PCI device state is released synchronously by
pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device(). This mismatch causes problems, for
example the device may be re-discovered as a new device before the
release handler has been called, leaving the PCI and EEH state
mismatched.

So instead, call eeh_remove_device() from the bus device removal
handlers, which are called synchronously in the removal path.
