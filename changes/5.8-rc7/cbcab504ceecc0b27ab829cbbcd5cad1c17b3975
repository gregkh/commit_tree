drm: pl111: Simplify vexpress init

The init VExpress variants currently instantiates a 'muxfpga' driver for
the sole purpose of getting a regmap for it. There's no reason to
instantiate a driver and doing so just complicates things. The muxfpga
driver also isn't unregistered properly on module unload. Let's
just simplify all this this by just calling
devm_regmap_init_vexpress_config() directly.
