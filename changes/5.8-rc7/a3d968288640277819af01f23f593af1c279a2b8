staging: wfx: remove useless defines

Several values defined in hif API are only here to define length of some
arrays. In most cases, they do not provide any extra information about
the size of the array (ie. "API_FIRMWARE_LABEL_SIZE" is only used to
define the size of member "firmware_label").

Remove these useless definitions.
