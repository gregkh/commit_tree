drm/i915: Rename bw_state to new_bw_state

That is a preparation patch before next one where we
introduce old_bw_state and a bunch of other changes
as well.
In a review comment it was suggested to split out
at least that renaming into a separate patch, what
is done here.

v2: Removed spurious space
