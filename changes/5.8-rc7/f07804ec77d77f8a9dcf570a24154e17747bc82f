staging: comedi: ni_6527: fix INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG support

`ni6527_intr_insn_config()` processes `INSN_CONFIG` comedi instructions
for the "interrupt" subdevice.  When `data[0]` is
`INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG` it is configuring the digital trigger.  When
`data[2]` is `COMEDI_DIGITAL_TRIG_ENABLE_EDGES` it is configuring rising
and falling edge detection for the digital trigger, using a base channel
number (or shift amount) in `data[3]`, a rising edge bitmask in
`data[4]` and falling edge bitmask in `data[5]`.

If the base channel number (shift amount) is greater than or equal to
the number of channels (24) of the digital input subdevice, there are no
changes to the rising and falling edges, so the mask of channels to be
changed can be set to 0, otherwise the mask of channels to be changed,
and the rising and falling edge bitmasks are shifted by the base channel
number before calling `ni6527_set_edge_detection()` to change the
appropriate registers.  Unfortunately, the code is comparing the base
channel (shift amount) to the interrupt subdevice's number of channels
(1) instead of the digital input subdevice's number of channels (24).
Fix it by comparing to 32 because all shift amounts for an `unsigned
int` must be less than that and everything from bit 24 upwards is
ignored by `ni6527_set_edge_detection()` anyway.
