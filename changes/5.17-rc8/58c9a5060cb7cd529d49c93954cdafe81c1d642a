arm64: proton-pack: Include unprivileged eBPF status in Spectre v2 mitigation reporting

The mitigations for Spectre-BHB are only applied when an exception is
taken from user-space. The mitigation status is reported via the spectre_v2
sysfs vulnerabilities file.

When unprivileged eBPF is enabled the mitigation in the exception vectors
can be avoided by an eBPF program.

When unprivileged eBPF is enabled, print a warning and report vulnerable
via the sysfs vulnerabilities file.
