tools kvm headers arm64: Update KVM headers from the kernel sources

To pick the changes from:

  a5905d6af492ee6a ("KVM: arm64: Allow SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3 to be discovered and migrated")

That don't causes any changes in tooling (when built on x86), only
addresses this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
