arm64: entry: Allow the trampoline text to occupy multiple pages

Adding a second set of vectors to .entry.tramp.text will make it
larger than a single 4K page.

Allow the trampoline text to occupy up to three pages by adding two
more fixmap slots. Previous changes to tramp_valias allowed it to reach
beyond a single page.
