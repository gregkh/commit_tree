xen/gntalloc: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access()

Using gnttab_query_foreign_access() is unsafe, as it is racy by design.

The use case in the gntalloc driver is not needed at all. While at it
replace the call of gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() with a call of
gnttab_end_foreign_access(), which is what is really wanted there. In
case the grant wasn't used due to an allocation failure, just free the
grant via gnttab_free_grant_reference().

This is CVE-2022-23039 / part of XSA-396.
