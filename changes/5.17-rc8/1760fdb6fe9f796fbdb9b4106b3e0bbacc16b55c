mmc: core: Restore (almost) the busy polling for MMC_SEND_OP_COND

Commit 76bfc7ccc2fa ("mmc: core: adjust polling interval for CMD1"),
significantly decreased the polling period from ~10-12ms into just a couple
of us. The purpose was to decrease the total time spent in the busy polling
loop, but unfortunate it has lead to problems, that causes eMMC cards to
never gets out busy and thus fails to be initialized.

To fix the problem, but also to try to keep some of the new improved
behaviour, let's start by using a polling period of 1-2ms, which then
increases for each loop, according to common polling loop in
__mmc_poll_for_busy().
