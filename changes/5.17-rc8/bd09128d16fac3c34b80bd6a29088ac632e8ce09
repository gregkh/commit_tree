arm64: Add percpu vectors for EL1

The Spectre-BHB workaround adds a firmware call to the vectors. This
is needed on some CPUs, but not others. To avoid the unaffected CPU in
a big/little pair from making the firmware call, create per cpu vectors.

The per-cpu vectors only apply when returning from EL0.

Systems using KPTI can use the canonical 'full-fat' vectors directly at
EL1, the trampoline exit code will switch to this_cpu_vector on exit to
EL0. Systems not using KPTI should always use this_cpu_vector.

this_cpu_vector will point at a vector in tramp_vecs or
__bp_harden_el1_vectors, depending on whether KPTI is in use.
