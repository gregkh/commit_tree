virtio-blk: Don't use MAX_DISCARD_SEGMENTS if max_discard_seg is zero

Currently the value of max_discard_segment will be set to
MAX_DISCARD_SEGMENTS (256) with no basis in hardware if device
set 0 to max_discard_seg in configuration space. It's incorrect
since the device might not be able to handle such large descriptors.
To fix it, let's follow max_segments restrictions in this case.
