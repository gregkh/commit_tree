fuse: fix pipe buffer lifetime for direct_io

In FOPEN_DIRECT_IO mode, fuse_file_write_iter() calls
fuse_direct_write_iter(), which normally calls fuse_direct_io(), which then
imports the write buffer with fuse_get_user_pages(), which uses
iov_iter_get_pages() to grab references to userspace pages instead of
actually copying memory.

On the filesystem device side, these pages can then either be read to
userspace (via fuse_dev_read()), or splice()d over into a pipe using
fuse_dev_splice_read() as pipe buffers with &nosteal_pipe_buf_ops.

This is wrong because after fuse_dev_do_read() unlocks the FUSE request,
the userspace filesystem can mark the request as completed, causing write()
to return. At that point, the userspace filesystem should no longer have
access to the pipe buffer.

Fix by copying pages coming from the user address space to new pipe
buffers.
