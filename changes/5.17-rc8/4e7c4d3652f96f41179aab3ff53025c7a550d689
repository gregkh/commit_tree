clk: qcom: gdsc: Add support to update GDSC transition delay

GDSCs have multiple transition delays which are used for the GDSC FSM
states. Older targets/designs required these values to be updated from
gdsc code to certain default values for the FSM state to work as
expected. But on the newer targets/designs the values updated from the
GDSC driver can hamper the FSM state to not work as expected.

On SC7180 we observe black screens because the gdsc is being
enabled/disabled very rapidly and the GDSC FSM state does not work as
expected. This is due to the fact that the GDSC reset value is being
updated from SW.

Thus add support to update the transition delay from the clock
controller gdscs as required.
