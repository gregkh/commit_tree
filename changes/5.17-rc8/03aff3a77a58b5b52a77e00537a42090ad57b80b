arm64: entry: Free up another register on kpti's tramp_exit path

Kpti stashes x30 in far_el1 while it uses x30 for all its work.

Making the vectors a per-cpu data structure will require a second
register.

Allow tramp_exit two registers before it unmaps the kernel, by
leaving x30 on the stack, and stashing x29 in far_el1.
