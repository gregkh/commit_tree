watch_queue: Make comment about setting ->defunct more accurate

watch_queue_clear() has a comment stating that setting ->defunct to true
preventing new additions as well as preventing notifications.  Whilst
the latter is true, the first bit is superfluous since at the time this
function is called, the pipe cannot be accessed to add new event
sources.

Remove the "new additions" bit from the comment.
