virtio-blk: Remove BUG_ON() in virtio_queue_rq()

Currently we have a BUG_ON() to make sure the number of sg
list does not exceed queue_max_segments() in virtio_queue_rq().
However, the block layer uses queue_max_discard_segments()
instead of queue_max_segments() to limit the sg list for
discard requests. So the BUG_ON() might be triggered if
virtio-blk device reports a larger value for max discard
segment than queue_max_segments(). To fix it, let's simply
remove the BUG_ON() which has become unnecessary after commit
02746e26c39e("virtio-blk: avoid preallocating big SGL for data").
And the unused vblk->sg_elems can also be removed together.

Fixes: 1f23816b8eb8 ("virtio_blk: add discard and write zeroes support")
