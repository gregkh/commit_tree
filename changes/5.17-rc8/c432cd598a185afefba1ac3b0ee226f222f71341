soc: mediatek: mt8192-mmsys: Fix dither to dsi0 path's input sel

In commit d687e056a18f ("soc: mediatek: mmsys: Add mt8192 mmsys routing table"),
the mmsys routing table for mt8192 was introduced but the input selector
for DITHER->DSI0 has no value assigned to it.

This means that we are clearing bit 0 instead of setting it, blocking
communication between these two blocks; due to that, any display that
is connected to DSI0 will not work, as no data will go through.
The effect of that issue is that, during bootup, the DRM will block for
some time, while atomically waiting for a vblank that never happens;
later, the situation doesn't get better, leaving the display in a
non-functional state.

To fix this issue, fix the route entry in the table by assigning the
dither input selector to MT8192_DISP_DSI0_SEL_IN.
