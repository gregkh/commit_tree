net: arc_emac: Fix use after free in arc_mdio_probe()

If bus->state is equal to MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED, mdiobus_free(bus) will free
the "bus". But bus->name is still used in the next line, which will lead
to a use after free.

We can fix it by putting the name in a local variable and make the
bus->name point to the rodata section "name",then use the name in the
error message without referring to bus to avoid the uaf.
