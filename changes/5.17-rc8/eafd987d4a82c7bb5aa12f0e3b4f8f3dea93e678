x86/speculation: Warn about Spectre v2 LFENCE mitigation

With:

  f8a66d608a3e ("x86,bugs: Unconditionally allow spectre_v2=retpoline,amd")

it became possible to enable the LFENCE "retpoline" on Intel. However,
Intel doesn't recommend it, as it has some weaknesses compared to
retpoline.

Now AMD doesn't recommend it either.

It can still be left available as a cmdline option. It's faster than
retpoline but is weaker in certain scenarios -- particularly SMT, but
even non-SMT may be vulnerable in some cases.

So just unconditionally warn if the user requests it on the cmdline.
