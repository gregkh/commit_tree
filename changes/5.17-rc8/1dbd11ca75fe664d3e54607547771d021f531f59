xen: remove gnttab_query_foreign_access()

Remove gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as it is unused and unsafe to
use.

All previous use cases assumed a grant would not be in use after
gnttab_query_foreign_access() returned 0. This information is useless
in best case, as it only refers to a situation in the past, which could
have changed already.
