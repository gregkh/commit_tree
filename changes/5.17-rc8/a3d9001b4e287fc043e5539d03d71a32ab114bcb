Revert "xfrm: state and policy should fail if XFRMA_IF_ID 0"

This reverts commit 68ac0f3810e76a853b5f7b90601a05c3048b8b54 because ID
0 was meant to be used for configuring the policy/state without
matching for a specific interface (e.g., Cilium is affected, see
https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/18789 and
https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/19019).
