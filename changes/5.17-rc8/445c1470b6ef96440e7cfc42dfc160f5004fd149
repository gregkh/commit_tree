x86/boot: Add setup_indirect support in early_memremap_is_setup_data()

The x86 boot documentation describes the setup_indirect structures and
how they are used. Only one of the two functions in ioremap.c that needed
to be modified to be aware of the introduction of setup_indirect
functionality was updated. Adds comparable support to the other function
where it was missing.
