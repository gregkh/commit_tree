drm/i915/psr: Set "SF Partial Frame Enable" also on full update

Currently we are observing occasional screen flickering when
PSR2 selective fetch is enabled. More specifically glitch seems
to happen on full frame update when cursor moves to coords
x = -1 or y = -1.

According to Bspec SF Single full frame should not be set if
SF Partial Frame Enable is not set. This happened to be true for
ADLP as PSR2_MAN_TRK_CTL_ENABLE is always set and for ADL_P it's
actually "SF Partial Frame Enable" (Bit 31).

Setting "SF Partial Frame Enable" bit also on full update seems to
fix screen flickering.

Also make code more clear by setting PSR2_MAN_TRK_CTL_ENABLE
only if not on ADL_P. Bit 31 has different meaning in ADL_P.

Bspec: 49274
