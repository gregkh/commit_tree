arm64: entry: Move trampoline macros out of ifdef'd section

The macros for building the kpti trampoline are all behind
CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0, and in a region that outputs to the
.entry.tramp.text section.

Move the macros out so they can be used to generate other kinds of
trampoline. Only the symbols need to be guarded by
CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 and appear in the .entry.tramp.text section.
