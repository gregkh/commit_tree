ext4: factor out write end code of inline file

Now that the inline_data file write end procedure are falled into the
common write end functions, it is not clear. Factor them out and do
some cleanup. This patch also drop ext4_da_write_inline_data_end()
and switch to use ext4_write_inline_data_end() instead because we also
need to do the same error processing if we failed to write data into
inline entry.
