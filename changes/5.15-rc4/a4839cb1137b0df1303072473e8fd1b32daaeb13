drm/i915: Stop manually RCU banging in reset_stats_ioctl (v2)

As far as I can tell, the only real reason for this is to avoid taking a
reference to the i915_gem_context.  The cost of those two atomics
probably pales in comparison to the cost of the ioctl itself so we're
really not buying ourselves anything here.  We're about to make context
lookup a tiny bit more complicated, so let's get rid of the one hand-
rolled case.

Some usermode drivers such as our Vulkan driver call GET_RESET_STATS on
every execbuf so the perf here could theoretically be an issue.  If this
ever does become a performance issue for any such userspace drivers,
they can use set CONTEXT_PARAM_RECOVERABLE to false and look for -EIO
coming from execbuf to check for hangs instead.
