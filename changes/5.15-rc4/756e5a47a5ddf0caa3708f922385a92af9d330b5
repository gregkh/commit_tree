kasan: test: avoid corrupting memory in copy_user_test

copy_user_test() does writes past the allocated object.  As the result, it
corrupts kernel memory, which might lead to crashes with the HW_TAGS mode,
as it neither uses quarantine nor redzones.

(Technically, this test can't yet be enabled with the HW_TAGS mode, but
this will be implemented in the future.)

Adjust the test to only write memory within the aligned kmalloc object.
