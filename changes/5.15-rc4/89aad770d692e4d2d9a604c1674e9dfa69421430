habanalabs: fix nullifying of destroyed mmu pgt pool

In case of host-resident MMU, when the page tables pool is destroyed,
its pointer is not nullified correctly.
As a result, on a device fini which happens after a failing reset, the
already destroyed pool is accessed, which leads to a kernel panic.
The patch fixes the setting of the pool pointer to NULL.
