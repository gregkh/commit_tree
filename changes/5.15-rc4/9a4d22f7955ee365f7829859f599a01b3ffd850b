tty: serial: samsung: Add Exynos850 SoC data

Add serial driver data for Exynos850 SoC. This driver data is basically
reusing EXYNOS_COMMON_SERIAL_DRV_DATA, which is common for all Exynos
chips, but also enables USI init, which was added in previous commit:
"tty: serial: samsung: Init USI to keep clocks running".
