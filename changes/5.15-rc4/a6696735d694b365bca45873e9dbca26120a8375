net/mlx5e: Convert TIR to a dedicated object

Code related to TIR is now encapsulated into a dedicated object and put
into new files en/tir.{c,h}. All usages are converted.

The Builder pattern is used to initialize a TIR. It allows to create a
multitude of different configurations, turning on and off some specific
features in different combinations, without having long parameter lists,
initializers per usage and repeating code in initializers.
