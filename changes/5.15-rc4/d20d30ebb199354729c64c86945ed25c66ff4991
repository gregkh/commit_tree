cgroup: Avoid compiler warnings with no subsystems

As done before in commit cb4a31675270 ("cgroup: use bitmask to filter
for_each_subsys"), avoid compiler warnings for the pathological case of
having no subsystems (i.e. CGROUP_SUBSYS_COUNT == 0). This condition is
hit for the arm multi_v7_defconfig config under -Wzero-length-bounds:
