ravb: Add struct ravb_hw_info to driver data

The DMAC and EMAC blocks of Gigabit Ethernet IP found on RZ/G2L SoC are
similar to the R-Car Ethernet AVB IP. With a few changes in the driver we
can support both IPs.

This patch adds the struct ravb_hw_info to hold hw features, driver data
and function pointers to support both the IPs. It also replaces the driver
data chip type with struct ravb_hw_info by moving chip type to it.
