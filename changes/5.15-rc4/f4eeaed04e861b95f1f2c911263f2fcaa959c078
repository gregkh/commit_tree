ASoC: Intel: Fix platform ID matching

Sparse warnings triggered truncating the IDs of some platform device
tables. Unfortunately some of the IDs in the match tables were missed
which breaks audio. The KBL change has been verified to fix audio, the
CML change was not tested as it was found through grepping the broken
changes and found to match the same situation in anticipation that it
should also be fixed.
