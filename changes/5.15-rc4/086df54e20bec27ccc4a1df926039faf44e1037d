drm/i915/xehpsdv: add initial XeHP SDV definitions

XeHP SDV is a Intel® dGPU without display. This is just the definition
of some basic platform macros, by large a copy of current state of
Tigerlake which does not reflect the end state of this platform.

v2:
 - Switch to intel_step infrastructure for stepping matches. (Jani)
v3:
 - Bring earlier in patch series and leave addition of new media engines
   to the engine mask for a later patch.
