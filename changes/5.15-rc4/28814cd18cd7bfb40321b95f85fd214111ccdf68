ipv4: Fix refcount warning for new fib_info

Ioana reported a refcount warning when booting over NFS:

fib_treeref needs to be set after kzalloc. The old code had a ++ which
led to the confusion when the int was replaced by a refcount_t.

Fixes: 79976892f7ea ("net: convert fib_treeref from int to refcount_t")
