net/mlx5: Reorganize current and maximal capabilities to be per-type

In the current code, the current and maximal capabilities are

allow the creation of such a basic structure as a dynamically
allocated array, we move curr and max fields to a unified
structure so that specific capabilities can be allocated as one unit.
