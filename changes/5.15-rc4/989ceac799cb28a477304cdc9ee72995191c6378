x86/build: Remove stale cc-option checks

cc-option, __cc-option, cc-option-yn, and cc-disable-warning all invoke
the compiler during build time, and can slow down the build when these
checks become stale for our supported compilers, whose minimally
supported versions increases over time.

See Documentation/process/changes.rst for the current supported minimal
versions (GCC 4.9+, clang 10.0.1+). Compiler version support for these
flags may be verified on godbolt.org.

The following flags are supported by all supported versions of GCC and
Clang. Remove their cc-option, __cc-option, and cc-option-yn tests.

  -Wno-address-of-packed-member
  -mno-avx
  -m32
  -mno-80387
  -march=k8
  -march=nocona
  -march=core2
  -march=atom
  -mtune=generic
  -mfentry
