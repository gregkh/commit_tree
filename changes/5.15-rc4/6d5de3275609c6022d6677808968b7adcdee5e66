drm/i915: Check for nomodeset in i915_init() first

When modesetting (aka the full pci driver, which has nothing to do
with disable_display option, which just gives you the full pci driver
without the display driver) is disabled, we load nothing and do
nothing.

So move that check first, for a bit of orderliness. With Jason's
module init/exit table this now becomes trivial.
