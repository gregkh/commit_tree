netfilter: nf_nat_masquerade: defer conntrack walk to work queue

The ipv4 and device notifiers are called with RTNL mutex held.
The table walk can take some time, better not block other RTNL users.

'ip a' has been reported to block for up to 20 seconds when conntrack table
has many entries and device down events are frequent (e.g., PPP).
