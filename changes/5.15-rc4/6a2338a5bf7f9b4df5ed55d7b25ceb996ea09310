phy: cadence-torrent: Configure PHY registers as a function of input reference clock rate

Torrent PHY supports multiple serdes standards with different input
reference clock frequencies. PHY register values differ based on the
reference clock rate. Add PHY input reference clock frequency as a
new dimension to select proper register configuration. No functional
change is intended.
