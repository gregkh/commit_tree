drm/i915/dpcd_bl: Cleanup intel_dp_aux_vesa_enable_backlight() a bit

Get rid of the extraneous switch case in here, and just open code
edp_backlight_mode as we only ever use it once.

v4:
* Check that backlight mode is DP_EDP_BACKLIGHT_CONTROL_MODE_DPCD, not
  DP_EDP_BACKLIGHT_CONTROL_MODE_MASK - imirkin
