drm/amd/display: remove compbuf size wait

This tends to take miliseconds in certain scenarios and we'd rather not
wait that long. Due to how this interacts with det size update and
locking waiting should not be necessary as compbuf updates before
unlock.

Add a watch for config error instead as that is something we actually do
care about.
