perf inject: Fix output from a file to a pipe

When the input is a regular file but the output is a pipe, it should
write a pipe header.  But just repiping would write a portion of the
existing header which is different in 'size' value.  So we need to
prevent it and write a new pipe header along with other information
like event attributes and features.

This can handle something like this:

  # perf record -a -B sleep 1

  # perf inject -b -i perf.data | perf report -i -

Factor out perf_event__synthesize_for_pipe() to be shared between perf
record and inject.
