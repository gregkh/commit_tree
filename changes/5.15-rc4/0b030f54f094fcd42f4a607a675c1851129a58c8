dmaengine: idxd: make submit failure path consistent on desc freeing

The submission path for dmaengine API does not do descriptor freeing on
failure. Also, with the abort mechanism, the freeing of descriptor happens
when the abort callback is completed. Therefore free descriptor on all
error paths for submission call to make things consistent. Also remove the
double free that would happen on abort in idxd_dma_tx_submit() call.
