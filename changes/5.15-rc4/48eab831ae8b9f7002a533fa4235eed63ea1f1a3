net: create netdev->dev_addr assignment helpers

Recent work on converting address list to a tree made it obvious
we need an abstraction around writing netdev->dev_addr. Without
such abstraction updating the main device address is invisible
to the core.

Introduce a number of helpers which for now just wrap memcpy()
but in the future can make necessary changes to the address
tree.
