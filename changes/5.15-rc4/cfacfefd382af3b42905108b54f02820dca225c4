ASoC: SOF: trace: Omit error print when waking up trace sleepers

Do not print error message from snd_sof_trace_notify_for_error() when
possible sleeping trace work is woken up to flush the remaining debug
information.

This action by itself is not an error, it is just an action we take when
an error occurs to make sure that all information have been fed to the
userspace (if we have trace in use).
