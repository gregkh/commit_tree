amd/display: enable panel orientation quirks

This patch allows panel orientation quirks from DRM core to be
used. They attach a DRM connector property "panel orientation"
which indicates in which direction the panel has been mounted.
Some machines have the internal screen mounted with a rotation.

Since the panel orientation quirks need the native mode from the
EDID, check for it in amdgpu_dm_connector_ddc_get_modes.
