ceph: Fix race between hole punch and page fault

Ceph has a following race between hole punching and page fault:

CPU1                                  CPU2
ceph_fallocate()
  ...
  ceph_zero_pagecache_range()
                                      ceph_filemap_fault()
                                        faults in page in the range being
                                        punched
  ceph_zero_objects()

And now we have a page in punched range with invalid data. Fix the
problem by using mapping->invalidate_lock similarly to other
filesystems. Note that using invalidate_lock also fixes a similar race
wrt ->readpage().
