arm64/kexec: Test page size support with new TGRAN range values

The commit 26f55386f964 ("arm64/mm: Fix __enable_mmu() for new TGRAN range
values") had already switched into testing ID_AA64MMFR0_TGRAN range values.
This just changes system_supports_[4|16|64]kb_granule() helpers to perform
similar range tests as well. While here, it standardizes page size specific
supported min and max TGRAN values.
