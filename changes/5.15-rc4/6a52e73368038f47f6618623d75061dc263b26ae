net: dsa: destroy the phylink instance on any error in dsa_slave_phy_setup

DSA supports connecting to a phy-handle, and has a fallback to a non-OF
based method of connecting to an internal PHY on the switch's own MDIO
bus, if no phy-handle and no fixed-link nodes were present.

The -ENODEV error code from the first attempt (phylink_of_phy_connect)
is what triggers the second attempt (phylink_connect_phy).

However, when the first attempt returns a different error code than
-ENODEV, this results in an unbalance of calls to phylink_create and
phylink_destroy by the time we exit the function. The phylink instance
has leaked.

There are many other error codes that can be returned by
phylink_of_phy_connect. For example, phylink_validate returns -EINVAL.
So this is a practical issue too.
