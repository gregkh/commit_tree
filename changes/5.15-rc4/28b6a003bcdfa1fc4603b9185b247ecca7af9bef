misc/pvpanic-pci: Allow automatic loading

The virtual machine monitor (QEMU) exposes the pvpanic-pci
device to the guest. On guest side the module exists but
currently isn't loaded automatically. So the driver fails
to be probed and does not its job of handling guest panic
events.

Instead of requiring manual modprobe, let's include a device
database using the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro and let the
module auto-load when the guest gets exposed with such a
pvpanic-pci device.
