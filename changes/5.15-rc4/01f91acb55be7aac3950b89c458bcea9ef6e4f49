selftests: KVM: Align SMCCC call with the spec in steal_time

The SMC64 calling convention passes a function identifier in w0 and its
parameters in x1-x17. Given this, there are two deviations in the
SMC64 call performed by the steal_time test: the function identifier is
assigned to a 64 bit register and the parameter is only 32 bits wide.

Align the call with the SMCCC by using a 32 bit register to handle the
function identifier and increasing the parameter width to 64 bits.
