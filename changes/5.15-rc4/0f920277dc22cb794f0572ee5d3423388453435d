misc: gehc-achc: new driver

General Electric Healthcare's PPD has a secondary processor from
NXP's Kinetis K20 series. That device has two SPI chip selects:

The main interface's behaviour depends on the loaded firmware
and is currently unused.

The secondary interface can be used to update the firmware using
EzPort protocol. This is implemented by this driver using the
kernel's firmware API. The firmware is being flashed into
non-volatile flash memory, so it is enough to flash it once
and not on every boot. Flashing will wear the flash memory
(it has a life time of at least 10k programming cycles). At
the same time only occasional FW updates are expected (like e.g.
a BIOS update). Thus the firmware update is triggered via sysfs
instead of doing it in the driver's probe routine like many
other drivers.
