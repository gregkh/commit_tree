igc: Export LEDs

Each i225 has three LEDs. Export them via the LED class framework.

Each LED is controllable via sysfs. Example:

$ cd /sys/class/leds/igc_led0
$ cat brightness      # Current Mode
$ cat max_brightness  # 15
$ echo 0 > brightness # Mode 0
$ echo 1 > brightness # Mode 1

The brightness field here reflects the different LED modes ranging
from 0 to 15.
