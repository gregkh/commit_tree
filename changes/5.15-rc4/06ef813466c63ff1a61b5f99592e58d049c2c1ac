KVM: SVM: avoid refreshing avic if its state didn't change

Since AVIC can be inhibited and uninhibited rapidly it is possible that
we have nothing to do by the time the svm_refresh_apicv_exec_ctrl
is called.

Detect and avoid this, which will be useful when we will start calling
avic_vcpu_load/avic_vcpu_put when the avic inhibition state changes.
