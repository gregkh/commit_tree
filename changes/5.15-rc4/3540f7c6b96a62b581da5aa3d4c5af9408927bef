selftests/bpf: Add bpf_timer test.

Add bpf_timer test that creates timers in preallocated and
non-preallocated hash, in array and in lru maps.
Let array timer expire once and then re-arm it for 35 seconds.
Arm lru timer into the same callback.
Then arm and re-arm hash timers 10 times each.
At the last invocation of prealloc hash timer cancel the array timer.
Force timer free via LRU eviction and direct bpf_map_delete_elem.
