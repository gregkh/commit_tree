KVM: arm64: Rename KVM_PTE_LEAF_ATTR_S2_IGNORED

The ignored bits for both stage-1 and stage-2 page and block
descriptors are in [55:58], so rename KVM_PTE_LEAF_ATTR_S2_IGNORED to
make it applicable to both. And while at it, since these bits are more
commonly known as 'software' bits, rename accordingly.
