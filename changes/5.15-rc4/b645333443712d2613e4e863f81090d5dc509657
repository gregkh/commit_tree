udf: Fix iocharset=utf8 mount option

Currently iocharset=utf8 mount option is broken. To use UTF-8 as iocharset,
it is required to use utf8 mount option.

Fix iocharset=utf8 mount option to use be equivalent to the utf8 mount
option.

If UTF-8 as iocharset is used then s_nls_map is set to NULL. So simplify
code around, remove UDF_FLAG_NLS_MAP and UDF_FLAG_UTF8 flags as to
distinguish between UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 it is needed just to check if
s_nls_map set to NULL or not.
