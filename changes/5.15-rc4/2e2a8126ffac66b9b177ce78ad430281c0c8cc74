octeontx2-pf: Unify flow management variables

Variables used for TC flow management like maximum number
of flows, number of flows installed etc are a copy of ntuple
flow management variables. Since both TC and NTUPLE are not
supported at the same time, it's better to unify these with
common variables.

This patch addresses this unification and also does cleanup of
other minor stuff wrt TC.
