powerpc/xics: Set the IRQ chip data for the ICS native backend

The ICS native driver relies on the IRQ chip data to find the struct
'ics_native' describing the ICS controller but it was removed by commit
248af248a8f4 ("powerpc/xics: Rename the map handler in a check handler").
Revert this change to fix the Microwatt SoC platform.
