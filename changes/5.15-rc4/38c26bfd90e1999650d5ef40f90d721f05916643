xfs: replace xfs_sb_version checks with feature flag checks

Convert the xfs_sb_version_hasfoo() to checks against
mp->m_features. Checks of the superblock itself during disk
operations (e.g. in the read/write verifiers and the to/from disk
formatters) are not converted - they operate purely on the
superblock state. Everything else should use the mount features.

Large parts of this conversion were done with sed with commands like
this:

for f in `git grep -l xfs_sb_version_has fs/xfs/*.c`; do
	sed -i -e 's/xfs_sb_version_has\(.*\)(&\(.*\)->m_sb)/xfs_has_\1(\2)/' $f
done

With manual cleanups for things like "xfs_has_extflgbit" and other
little inconsistencies in naming.

The result is ia lot less typing to check features and an XFS binary
size reduced by a bit over 3kB:

$ size -t fs/xfs/built-in.a
	text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filenam
before	1130866  311352     484 1442702  16038e (TOTALS)
after	1127727  311352     484 1439563  15f74b (TOTALS)
