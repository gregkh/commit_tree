tracing: Have histogram types be constant when possible

Instead of kstrdup("const", GFP_KERNEL), have the hist_field type simply
assign the constant hist_field->type = "const"; And when the value passed
to it is a variable, use "kstrdup_const(var, GFP_KERNEL);" which will just
copy the value if the variable is already a constant. This saves on having
to allocate when not needed.

All frees of the hist_field->type will need to use kfree_const().
