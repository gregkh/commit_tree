opp: Don't print an error if required-opps is missing

The 'required-opps' property is considered optional, hence remove
the pr_err() in of_parse_required_opp() when we find the property is
missing.
While at it, also fix the return value of
of_get_required_opp_performance_state() when of_parse_required_opp()
fails, return a -ENODEV instead of the -EINVAL.
