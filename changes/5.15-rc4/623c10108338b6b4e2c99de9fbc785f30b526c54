ALSA: memalloc: Fix pgprot for WC mmap on x86

We have a special handling of WC pages on x86, and it's currently
specific to HD-audio.  The last forgotten piece was the pgprot setup
for the mmap with WC pages.

This patch moves the pgprot setup for WC pages from HD-audio-specific
mmap callback to the common helper code.  It allows us to remove the
superfluous mmap callback in HD-audio and its prepare_mmap
redirection.
