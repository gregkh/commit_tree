ocfs2: quota_local: fix possible uninitialized-variable access in ocfs2_local_read_info()

A memory block is allocated through kmalloc(), and its return value is
assigned to the pointer oinfo. However, oinfo->dqi_gqinode is not
initialized but it is accessed in:
  iput(oinfo->dqi_gqinode);

To fix this possible uninitialized-variable access, assign NULL to
oinfo->dqi_gqinode, and add ocfs2_qinfo_lock_res_init() behind the
assignment in ocfs2_local_read_info().  Remove ocfs2_qinfo_lock_res_init()
in ocfs2_global_read_info().
