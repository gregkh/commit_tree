ptp: Fix ptp_kvm_getcrosststamp issue for x86 ptp_kvm

hv_clock is preallocated to have only HVC_BOOT_ARRAY_SIZE (64) elements;
if the PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE ioctl is executed on vCPUs whose index is
64 of higher, retrieving the struct pvclock_vcpu_time_info pointer with
"src = &hv_clock[cpu].pvti" will result in an out-of-bounds access and
a wild pointer.  Change it to "this_cpu_pvti()" which is guaranteed to
be valid.
