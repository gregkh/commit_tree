usb: dwc3: imx8mp: request irq after initializing dwc3

If IRQ occurs between calling  devm_request_threaded_irq() and
initializing dwc3_imx->dwc3, then null pointer dereference occurs
since dwc3_imx->dwc3 is used in dwc3_imx8mp_interrupt().

The patch puts registration of the interrupt handler after
initializing of neccesery data.
