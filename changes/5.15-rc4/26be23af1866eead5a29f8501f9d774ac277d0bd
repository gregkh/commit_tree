MAINTAINERS: fix update references to stm32 audio bindings

The 00d38fd8d2524 ("MAINTAINERS: update references to stm32 audio bindings")
commit update the bindings reference, by
removing bindings/sound/st,stm32-adfsdm.txt, to set the
new reference to bindings/iio/adc/st,stm32-*.yaml.

This leads to "get_maintainer finds" the match for the
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/adc/st,stm32-dfsdm-adc.yaml,
but also to the IIO bindings
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/adc/st,stm32-adc.yaml

And The commit fixes only a part of the problem:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/st,stm32-*.txt file have been
also moved to yaml.

Update references to include all stm32 audio bindings file and
exclude the st,stm32-adc.yaml bindings file.
