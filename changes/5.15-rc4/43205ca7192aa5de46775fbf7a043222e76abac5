ksmbd: fix translation in ksmbd_acls_fattr()

When creating new filesystem objects ksmbd translates between k*ids and
s*ids. For this it often uses struct smb_fattr and stashes the k*ids in
cf_uid and cf_gid. Let cf_uid and cf_gid always contain the final
information taking any potential idmapped mounts into account. When
finally translation cf_*id into s*ids translate them into the user
namespace of ksmbd since that is the relevant user namespace here.
