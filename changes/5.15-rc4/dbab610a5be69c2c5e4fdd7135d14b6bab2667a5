KVM: x86: nVMX: re-evaluate emulation_required on nested VM exit

If L1 had invalid state on VM entry (can happen on SMM transactions
when we enter from real mode, straight to nested guest),

then after we load 'host' state from VMCS12, the state has to become
valid again, but since we load the segment registers with
__vmx_set_segment we weren't always updating emulation_required.

Update emulation_required explicitly at end of load_vmcs12_host_state.
