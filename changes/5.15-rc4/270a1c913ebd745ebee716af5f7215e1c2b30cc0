block: provide bio_clear_hipri() helper

Any case that turns off REQ_HIPRI must also clear BIO_PERCPU_CACHE,
as non-polled IO may complete through hard/soft IRQ and hence isn't
safe for our polled bio alloc cache.

Provide a helper that does just that, and use it in the merging code as
well if we split a bio and turn off polling.
