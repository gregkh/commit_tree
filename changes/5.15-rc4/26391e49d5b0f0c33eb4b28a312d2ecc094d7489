mmc: dw_mmc: Only inject fault before done/error

The fault injection function can set EVENT_DATA_ERROR but skip the
setting of ->data_status to an error status if it hits just after a data
over interrupt.  This confuses the tasklet which can later end up
triggering the WARN_ON(host->cmd || ..) in dw_mci_request_end() since
dw_mci_data_complete() would return success.

Prevent the fault injection function from doing this since this is not a
real case, and ensure that the fault injection doesn't race with a real
error either.
