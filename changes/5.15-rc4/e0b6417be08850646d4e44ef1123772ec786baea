MAINTAINERS: add VM SOCKETS (AF_VSOCK) entry

Add a new entry for VM Sockets (AF_VSOCK) that covers vsock core,
tests, and headers. Move some general vsock stuff from virtio-vsock
entry into this new more general vsock entry.

I've been reviewing and contributing for the last few years,
so I'm available to help maintain this code.
