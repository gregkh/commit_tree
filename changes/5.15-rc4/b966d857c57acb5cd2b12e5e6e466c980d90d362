drm: bridge: ti-sn65dsi83: Move LVDS format selection to .mode_set()

The LVDS format is selected based on the bus format reported by the
connector. This is currently done in .mode_fixup(), but that's not the
right place, as the format should be selected when setting the mode.
Move it to .mode_set().
