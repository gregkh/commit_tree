powerpc/powernv/pci: Customize the MSI EOI handler to support PHB3

PHB3s need an extra OPAL call to EOI the interrupt. The call takes an
OPAL HW IRQ number but it is translated into a vector number in OPAL.
Here, we directly use the vector number of the in-the-middle "PNV-MSI"
domain instead of grabbing the OPAL HW IRQ number in the XICS parent
domain.
