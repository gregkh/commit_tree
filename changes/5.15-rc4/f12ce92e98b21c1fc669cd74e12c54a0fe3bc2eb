ASoC: fsl_esai: register platform component before registering cpu dai

There is no defer probe when adding platform component to
snd_soc_pcm_runtime(rtd), the code is in snd_soc_add_pcm_runtime()

snd_soc_register_card()
  -> snd_soc_bind_card()
    -> snd_soc_add_pcm_runtime()
      -> adding cpu dai
      -> adding codec dai
      -> adding platform component.

So if the platform component is not ready at that time, then the
sound card still registered successfully, but platform component
is empty, the sound card can't be used.

As there is defer probe checking for cpu dai component, then register
platform component before cpu dai to avoid such issue.
