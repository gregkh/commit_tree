net, core: Allow netdev_lower_get_next_private_rcu in bh context

For the XDP bonding slave lookup to work in the NAPI poll context in which
the redudant rcu_read_lock() has been removed we have to follow the same
approach as in 694cea395fde ("bpf: Allow RCU-protected lookups to happen
from bh context") and modify the WARN_ON to also check rcu_read_lock_bh_held().
