erofs: dax support for non-tailpacking regular file

DAX is quite useful for some VM use cases in order to save guest
memory extremely with minimal lightweight EROFS.

In order to prepare for such use cases, add preliminary dax support
for non-tailpacking regular files for now.

Tested with the DRAM-emulated PMEM and the EROFS image generated by
"mkfs.erofs -Enoinline_data enwik9.fsdax.img enwik9"
