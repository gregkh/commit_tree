ovl: fix BUG_ON() in may_delete() when called from ovl_cleanup()

If function ovl_instantiate() returns an error, ovl_cleanup will be called
and try to remove newdentry from wdir, but the newdentry has been moved to
udir at this time.  This will causes BUG_ON(victim->d_parent->d_inode !=
dir) in fs/namei.c:may_delete.
