Revert "net: dsa: Allow drivers to filter packets they can decode source port from"

This reverts commit cc1939e4b3aaf534fb2f3706820012036825731c.

Currently 2 classes of DSA drivers are able to send/receive packets
directly through the DSA master:
- drivers with DSA_TAG_PROTO_NONE
- sja1105

Now that sja1105 has gained the ability to perform traffic termination
even under the tricky case (VLAN-aware bridge), and that is much more
functional (we can perform VLAN-aware bridging with foreign interfaces),
there is no reason to keep this code in the receive path of the network
core. So delete it.
