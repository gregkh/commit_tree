drm/i915/gem: Introduce a selftest for the gem object migrate functionality

A selftest for the gem object migrate functionality. Slightly adapted
from the original by Matthew to the new interface and new fill blit
code.

v4:
- Initialize buffers and check contents after migration
  (Suggested by Matthew Auld)
- Perform async migration (if implemented) in the igt_lmem_pages_migrate
  test
- Test also migration to the current region.
