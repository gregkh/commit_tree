net/sched: store the last executed chain also for clsact egress

currently, only 'ingress' and 'clsact ingress' qdiscs store the tc 'chain
id' in the skb extension. However, userspace programs (like ovs) are able
to setup egress rules, and datapath gets confused in case it doesn't find
the 'chain id' for a packet that's "recirculated" by tc.
Change tcf_classify() to have the same semantic as tcf_classify_ingress()
so that a single function can be called in ingress / egress, using the tc
ingress / egress block respectively.
