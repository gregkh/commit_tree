namei: Standardize callers of filename_create()

filename_create() has two variants, one which drops the caller's
reference to filename (filename_create) and one which does
not (__filename_create). This can be confusing as it's unusual to drop a
caller's reference. Remove filename_create, rename __filename_create
to filename_create, and convert all callers.
