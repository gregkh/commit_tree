Makefile: remove stale cc-option checks

cc-option, cc-option-yn, and cc-disable-warning all invoke the compiler
during build time, and can slow down the build when these checks become
stale for our supported compilers, whose minimally supported versions
increases over time. See Documentation/process/changes.rst for the
current supported minimal versions (GCC 4.9+, clang 10.0.1+). Compiler
version support for these flags may be verified on godbolt.org.

The following flags are GCC only and supported since at least GCC 4.9.
Remove cc-option and cc-disable-warning tests.
* -fno-tree-loop-im
* -Wno-maybe-uninitialized
* -fno-reorder-blocks
* -fno-ipa-cp-clone
* -fno-partial-inlining
* -femit-struct-debug-baseonly
* -fno-inline-functions-called-once
* -fconserve-stack

The following flags are supported by all supported versions of GCC and
Clang. Remove their cc-option, cc-option-yn, and cc-disable-warning tests.
* -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks
* -fno-var-tracking
* -Wno-array-bounds

The following configs are made dependent on GCC, since they use GCC
specific flags.
* READABLE_ASM
* DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH

-mfentry was not supported by s390-linux-gnu-gcc until gcc-9+, add a
comment.

--param=allow-store-data-races=0 was renamed to -fno-allow-store-data-races
in the GCC 10 release; add a comment.

-Wmaybe-uninitialized (GCC specific) was being added for CONFIG_GCOV,
then again unconditionally; add it only once.

Also, base RETPOLINE_CFLAGS and RETPOLINE_VDSO_CFLAGS on CONFIC_CC_IS_*
then remove cc-option tests for Clang.
