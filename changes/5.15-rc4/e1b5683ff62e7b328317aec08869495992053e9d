net: mana: Move NAPI from EQ to CQ

The existing code has NAPI threads polling on EQ directly. To prepare
for EQ sharing among vPorts, move NAPI from EQ to CQ so that one EQ
can serve multiple CQs from different vPorts.

The "arm bit" is only set when CQ processing is completed to reduce
the number of EQ entries, which in turn reduce the number of interrupts
on EQ.
