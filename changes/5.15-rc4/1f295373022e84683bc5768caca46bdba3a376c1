btrfs: update comment at log_conflicting_inodes()

A comment at log_conflicting_inodes() mentions that we check the inode's
logged_trans field instead of using btrfs_inode_in_log() because the field
last_log_commit is not updated when we log that an inode exists and the
inode has the full sync flag (BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC) set. The part
about the full sync flag is not true anymore since commit 9acc8103ab594f
("btrfs: fix unpersisted i_size on fsync after expanding truncate"), so
update the comment to not mention that part anymore.
