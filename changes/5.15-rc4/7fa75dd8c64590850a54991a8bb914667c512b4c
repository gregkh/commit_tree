PCI/VPD: Don't check Large Resource Item Names for validity

VPD consists of a series of Small and Large Resources.  Computing the size
of VPD requires only the length of each, which is specified in the generic
tag of each resource.  We only expect to see ID_STRING, RO_DATA, and
RW_DATA in VPD, but it's not a problem if it contains other resource types
because all we care about is the size.

Drop the validity checking of Large Resource items.
