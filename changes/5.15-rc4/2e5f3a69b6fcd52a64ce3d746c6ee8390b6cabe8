tty: serial: uartlite: Use read_poll_timeout for a polling loop

read_poll_timeout was recently introduced, and can be used to simplify
our console polling loop. This results in a slight reduction in code.
early_uartlite_putc can't get the same treatment, because it can be
called before udelay is set up.
