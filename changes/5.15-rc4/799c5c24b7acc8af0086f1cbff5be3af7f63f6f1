net: ipa: don't use ipa_clock_get() in "ipa_uc.c"

Replace the ipa_clock_get() call in ipa_uc_clock() when taking the
"proxy" clock reference for the microcontroller with a call to
pm_runtime_get_sync().  Replace calls of ipa_clock_put() for the
microcontroller with pm_runtime_put() calls instead.

There is a chance we get an error when taking the microcontroller
power reference.  This is an unlikely scenario, where system suspend
is initiated just before we learn the modem is booting.  For now
we'll just accept that this could occur, and report it if it does.
