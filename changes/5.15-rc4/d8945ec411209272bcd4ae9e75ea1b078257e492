vdpa: Support transferring virtual addressing during DMA mapping

This patch introduces an attribute for vDPA device to indicate
whether virtual address can be used. If vDPA device driver set
it, vhost-vdpa bus driver will not pin user page and transfer
userspace virtual address instead of physical address during
DMA mapping. And corresponding vma->vm_file and offset will be
also passed as an opaque pointer.
