KVM: KVM: Use cpumask_available() to check for NULL cpumask when kicking vCPUs

Check for a NULL cpumask_var_t when kicking multiple vCPUs via
cpumask_available(), which performs a !NULL check if and only if cpumasks
are configured to be allocated off-stack.  This is a meaningless
optimization, e.g. avoids a TEST+Jcc and TEST+CMOV on x86, but more
importantly helps document that the NULL check is necessary even though
all callers pass in a local variable.

No functional change intended.
