clk: qcom: adjust selects for SM_VIDEOCC_8150 and SM_VIDEOCC_8250

Commit 5658e8cf1a8a ("clk: qcom: add video clock controller driver for
SM8150") and commit 0e94711a1f29 ("clk: qcom: add video clock controller
driver for SM8250") add config SM_VIDEOCC_8150 and config SM_VIDEOCC_8250,
which select the non-existing configs SDM_GCC_8150 and SDM_GCC_8250,
respectively.

Hence, ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py warns:

SDM_GCC_8150
Referencing files: drivers/clk/qcom/Kconfig

SDM_GCC_8250
Referencing files: drivers/clk/qcom/Kconfig

It is probably just a typo (or naming confusion of using SM_GCC_xxx and
SDM_GCC_xxx for various Qualcomm clock drivers) in the config definitions
for config SM_VIDEOCC_8150 and SM_VIDEOCC_8250, and intends to select the
existing SM_GCC_8150 and SM_GCC_8250, respectively.

Adjust the selects to the existing configs.
