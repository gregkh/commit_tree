mm/hugetlb: initialize hugetlb_usage in mm_init

After fork, the child process will get incorrect (2x) hugetlb_usage.  If
a process uses 5 2MB hugetlb pages in an anonymous mapping,

	HugetlbPages:	   10240 kB

and then forks, the child will show,

	HugetlbPages:	   20480 kB

The reason for double the amount is because hugetlb_usage will be copied
from the parent and then increased when we copy page tables from parent
to child.  Child will have 2x actual usage.

Fix this by adding hugetlb_count_init in mm_init.
