btrfs: allow idmapped SUBVOL_SETFLAGS ioctl

Setting flags on subvolumes or snapshots are core features of btrfs. The
SUBVOL_SETFLAGS ioctl is especially important as it allows to make
subvolumes and snapshots read-only or read-write. Allow setting flags on
btrfs subvolumes and snapshots on idmapped mounts. This is a fairly
straightforward operation since all the permission checking helpers are
already capable of handling idmapped mounts. So we just need to pass
down the mount's userns.
