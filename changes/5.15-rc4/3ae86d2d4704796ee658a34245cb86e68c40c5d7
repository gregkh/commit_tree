platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Fix Legion 5 Fn lock LED

This patch fixes the bug 212671.
Althrough the Fn lock (Fn + Esc) works on Legion 5 (R7000P), its LED
light does not change with the state. This modification sets the Fn lock
state to its current value on receiving the wmi event
8FC0DE0C-B4E4-43FD-B0F3-8871711C1294 to update the LED state.
