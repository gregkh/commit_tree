blk-zoned: allow zone management send operations without CAP_SYS_ADMIN

Zone management send operations (BLKRESETZONE, BLKOPENZONE, BLKCLOSEZONE
and BLKFINISHZONE) should be allowed under the same permissions as write().
(write() does not require CAP_SYS_ADMIN).

Additionally, other ioctls like BLKSECDISCARD and BLKZEROOUT only check if
the fd was successfully opened with FMODE_WRITE.
(They do not require CAP_SYS_ADMIN).

Currently, zone management send operations require both CAP_SYS_ADMIN
and that the fd was successfully opened with FMODE_WRITE.

Remove the CAP_SYS_ADMIN requirement, so that zone management send
operations match the access control requirement of write(), BLKSECDISCARD
and BLKZEROOUT.
