PM: AVS: qcom-cpr: Use nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u32()

Let's delete the private function cpr_read_efuse() since it does the
basically the same thing as the new API call
nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u32().

Differences between the new API call and the old private function:
* less error printing (I assume this is OK).
* will give an error if the value doesn't fit in 32-bits (the old code
  would have truncated silently).
