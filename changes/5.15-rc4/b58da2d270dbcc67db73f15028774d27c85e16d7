nvme: update keep alive interval when kato is modified

Currently the connection between host and NVMe-oF target gets
disconnected by keep-alive timeout when a user connects to a target
with a relatively large kato value and then sets the smaller kato
with a set features command (e.g. connects with 60 seconds kato value
and then sets 10 seconds kato value).

The cause is that keep alive command interval on the host, which is
defined as unsigned int kato in nvme_ctrl structure, does not follow
the kato value changes.

This patch updates the keep alive interval in the following steps when
the kato is modified by a set features command: stops the keep alive
work queue, then sets the kato as new timer value and re-start the queue.
