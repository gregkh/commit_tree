drm/i915/ttm: remove node usage in our naming

Now that ttm_resource_manager just returns a generic ttm_resource we
don't need to reference the mm_node stuff anymore which mostly only
makes sense for drm_mm_node. In the next few patches we want switch over
to the ttm_buddy_man which is just another type of ttm_resource so
reflect that in the naming.
