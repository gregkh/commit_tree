PCI: tegra: Remove unused struct tegra_pcie_bus

Following the code refactoring completed in the commit 1fd92928bab5
("PCI: tegra: Refactor configuration space mapping code") there are no
more known users of struct tegra_pcie_bus.

Thus, remove declaration of struct tegra_pcie_bus as it's no longer
needed and does not have any existing users left.
