net: hns3: disable firmware compatible features when uninstall PF

Currently, the firmware compatible features are enabled in PF driver
initialization process, but they are not disabled in PF driver
deinitialization process and firmware keeps these features in enabled
status.

In this case, if load an old PF driver (for example, in VM) which not
support the firmware compatible features, firmware will still send mailbox
message to PF when link status changed and PF will print
"un-supported mailbox message, code = 201".

To fix this problem, disable these firmware compatible features in PF
driver deinitialization process.
