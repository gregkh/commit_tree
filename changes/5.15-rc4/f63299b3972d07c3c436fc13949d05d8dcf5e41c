tty: serial: samsung: Fix driver data macros style

Make checkpatch happy by fixing this error:

    ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses

Although this change is made to keep macros consistent with consequent
patches (adding driver data for new SoC), it's intentionally added as a
separate patch to ease possible porting efforts in future.
