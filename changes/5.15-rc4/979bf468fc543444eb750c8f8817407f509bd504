{net, RDMA}/mlx5: Extend send to vport rules

In shared FDB there is only one eswitch which is active and it receives
traffic from all representors and all vports in the HCA.

While the Ethernet representor will always reside on its native PF
the IB representor will not. Extend send to vport rule creation to
support such flows. Need to account for source vport that sends the
traffic (on which the representors resides) and the target eswitch
the traffic which reach.
