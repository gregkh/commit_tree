dt-bindings: arm: Add virtio transport for SCMI

Document the properties for arm,scmi-virtio compatible nodes.
The backing virtio SCMI device is described in patch [1].

While doing that, make shmem property required only for pre-existing
mailbox and smc transports, since virtio-scmi does not need it.
