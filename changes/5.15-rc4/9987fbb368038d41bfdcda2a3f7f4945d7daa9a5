drm/amd/display: Get backlight from PWM if DMCU is not initialized

On Carrizo/Stoney systems we set backlight through panel_cntl, i.e.
directly via the PWM registers, if DMCU is not initialized. We
always read it back through ABM registers which leads to a
mismatch and forces atomic_commit to program the backlight
each time.

Instead make sure we use the same logic for backlight readback,
i.e. read it from panel_cntl if DMCU is not initialized.

We also need to remove some extraneous and incorrect calculations
at the end of dce_get_16_bit_backlight_from_pwm.
