ALSA: hda/realtek: Quirks to enable speaker output for Lenovo Legion 7i 15IMHG05, Yoga 7i 14ITL5/15ITL5, and 13s Gen2 laptops.

This patch initializes and enables speaker output on the Lenovo Legion 7i
15IMHG05, Yoga 7i 14ITL5/15ITL5, and 13s Gen2 series of laptops using the
HDA verb sequence specific to each model.

Speaker automute is suppressed for the Lenovo Legion 7i 15IMHG05 to avoid
breaking speaker output on resume and when devices are unplugged from its
headphone jack.

Thanks to: Andreas Holzer, Vincent Morel, sycxyc, Max Christian Pohle and
all others that helped.
