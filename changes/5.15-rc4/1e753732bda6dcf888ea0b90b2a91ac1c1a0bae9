s390/vfio-ap: r/w lock for PQAP interception handler function pointer

The function pointer to the interception handler for the PQAP instruction
can get changed during the interception process. Let's add a
semaphore to struct kvm_s390_crypto to control read/write access to the
function pointer contained therein.

The semaphore must be locked for write access by the vfio_ap device driver
when notified that the KVM pointer has been set or cleared. It must be
locked for read access by the interception framework when the PQAP
instruction is intercepted.
