HID: sony: support for the ghlive ps4 dongles

This commit adds support for the Guitar Hero Live PS4 dongles.

These dongles require a "magic" USB control message to be sent
every 8 seconds otherwise the dongle will not report events where
the strumbar is hit while a fret is being held.

Note that the GHL_GUITAR_POKE_INTERVAL is reduced to 8 seconds in order
to support PS3, Wii U, and PS4 GHL dongles.

Also note that the constant for vendor id 0x1430 has been renamed from
Activision to RedOctane as self-declared by the device.
