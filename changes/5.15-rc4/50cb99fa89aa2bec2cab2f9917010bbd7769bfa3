arm64: Do not trap PMSNEVFR_EL1

Commit 31c00d2aeaa2 ("arm64: Disable fine grained traps on boot") zeroed
the fine grained trap registers to prevent unwanted register traps from
occuring. However, for the PMSNEVFR_EL1 register, the corresponding
HDFG{R,W}TR_EL2.nPMSNEVFR_EL1 fields must be 1 to disable trapping. Set
both fields to 1 if FEAT_SPEv1p2 is detected to disable read and write
traps.
