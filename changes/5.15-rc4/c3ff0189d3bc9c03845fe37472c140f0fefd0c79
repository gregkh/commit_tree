mmc: dw_mmc: Fix issue with uninitialized dma_slave_config

Depending on the DMA driver being used, the struct dma_slave_config may
need to be initialized to zero for the unused data.

For example, we have three DMA drivers using src_port_window_size and
dst_port_window_size. If these are left uninitialized, it can cause DMA
failures.

For dw_mmc, this is probably not currently an issue but is still good to
fix though.
