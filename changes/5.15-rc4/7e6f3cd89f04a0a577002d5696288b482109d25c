bpf, x86: Store caller's ip in trampoline stack

Storing caller's ip in trampoline's stack. Trampoline programs
can reach the IP in (ctx - 8) address, so there's no change in
program's arguments interface.

The IP address is takes from [fp + 8], which is return address
from the initial 'call fentry' call to trampoline.

This IP address will be returned via bpf_get_func_ip helper
helper, which is added in following patches.
