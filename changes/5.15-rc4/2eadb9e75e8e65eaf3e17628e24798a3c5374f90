btrfs: make btrfs_finish_chunk_alloc private to block-group.c

One of the final things that must be done to add a new chunk is
inserting its device extent items in the device tree. They describe
the portion of allocated device physical space during phase 1 of
chunk allocation. This is currently done in btrfs_finish_chunk_alloc
whose name isn't very informative. What's more, this function is only
used in block-group.c but is defined as public. There isn't anything
special about it that would warrant it being defined in volumes.c.

Just move btrfs_finish_chunk_alloc and alloc_chunk_dev_extent to
block-group.c, make the former static and rename both functions to
insert_dev_extents and insert_dev_extent respectively.
