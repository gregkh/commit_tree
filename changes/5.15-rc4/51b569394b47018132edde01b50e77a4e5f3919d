drm/mgag200: Introduce custom CRTC state

Inherit from struct drm_crtc_state by embeding it and providing the
rsp callbacks for simple-kms helpers. No functional changes.

The new state struct mgag200_crtc_state will hold PLL values for modeset
operations.

v2:
	* move the simple-kms changes into a separate patch (Sam)
