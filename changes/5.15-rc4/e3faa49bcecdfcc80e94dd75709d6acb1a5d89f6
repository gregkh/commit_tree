tcp: enable data-less, empty-cookie SYN with TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD

Since the original TFO server code was implemented in commit
168a8f58059a22feb9e9a2dcc1b8053dbbbc12ef ("tcp: TCP Fast Open Server -
main code path") the TFO server code has supported the sysctl bit flag
TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD. Currently, when the TFO_SERVER_ENABLE and
TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD sysctl bit flags are set, a server connection
will accept a SYN with N bytes of data (N > 0) that has no TFO cookie,
create a new fast open connection, process the incoming data in the SYN,
and make the connection ready for accepting. After accepting, the
connection is ready for read()/recvmsg() to read the N bytes of data in
the SYN, ready for write()/sendmsg() calls and data transmissions to
transmit data.

This commit changes an edge case in this feature by changing this
behavior to apply to (N >= 0) bytes of data in the SYN rather than only
(N > 0) bytes of data in the SYN. Now, a server will accept a data-less
SYN without a TFO cookie if TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD is set.

Caveat! While this enables a new kind of TFO (data-less empty-cookie
SYN), some firewall rules setup may not work if they assume such packets
are not legit TFOs and will filter them.
