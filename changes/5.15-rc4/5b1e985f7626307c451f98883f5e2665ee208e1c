RDMA/irdma: Skip CQP ring during a reset

Due to duplicate reset flags, CQP commands are processed during reset.

This leads CQP failures such as below:

 irdma0: [Delete Local MAC Entry Cmd Error][op_code=49] status=-27 waiting=1 completion_err=0 maj=0x0 min=0x0

Remove the redundant flag and set the correct reset flag so CPQ is paused
during reset
