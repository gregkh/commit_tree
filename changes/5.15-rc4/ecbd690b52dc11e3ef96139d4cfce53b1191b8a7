octeontx2-af: Fix some memory leaks in the error handling path of 'cgx_lmac_init()'

Memory allocated before 'lmac' is stored in 'cgx->lmac_idmap[]' must be
freed explicitly. Otherwise, in case of error, it will leak.

Rename the 'err_irq' label to better describe what is done at this place in
the error handling path.
