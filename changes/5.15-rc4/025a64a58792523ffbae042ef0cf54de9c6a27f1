drm/amdgpu: I2C EEPROM full memory addressing

* "eeprom_addr" is now 32-bit wide.
* Remove "slave_addr" from the I2C EEPROM driver
  interface. The I2C EEPROM Device Type Identifier
  is fixed at 1010b, and the rest of the bits
  of the Device Address Byte/Device Select Code,
  are memory address bits, where the first three
  of those bits are the hardware selection bits.
  All this is now a 19-bit address and passed
  as "eeprom_addr". This abstracts the I2C bus
  for EEPROM devices for this I2C EEPROM driver.
  Now clients only pass the 19-bit EEPROM memory
  address, to the I2C EEPROM driver, as the 32-bit
  "eeprom_addr", from which they want to read from
  or write to.
