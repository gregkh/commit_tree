hwmon: (pmbus/ibm-cffps) max_power_out swap changes

The bytes for max_power_out from the ibm-cffps devices differ in byte
order for some power supplies.

The Witherspoon power supply returns the bytes in MSB/LSB order.

The Rainier power supply returns the bytes in LSB/MSB order.

The Witherspoon power supply uses version cffps1. The Rainier power
supply should use version cffps2. If version is cffps1, swap the bytes
before output to max_power_out.

Tested:
    Witherspoon before: 3148. Witherspoon after: 3148.
    Rainier before: 53255. Rainier after: 2000.
