arm64: dts: renesas: hihope-rzg2-ex: Add EtherAVB internal rx delay

Hihope boards use Realtek PHY. From the very beginning it use only
tx delays. However the phy driver commit bbc4d71d63549bcd003
("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx delay config") introduced
NFS mount failure. Now it needs rx delay inaddition to tx delay
for NFS mount to work. This patch fixes NFS mount failure issue
by adding MAC internal rx delay.
