huge tmpfs: revert shmem's use of transhuge_vma_enabled()

5.14 commit e6be37b2e7bd ("mm/huge_memory.c: add missing read-only THP
checking in transparent_hugepage_enabled()") added transhuge_vma_enabled()
as a wrapper for two very different checks (one check is whether the app
has marked its address range not to use THPs, the other check is whether
the app is running in a hierarchy that has been marked never to use THPs).
shmem_huge_enabled() prefers to show those two checks explicitly, as
before.
