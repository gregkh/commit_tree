tcp: seq_file: Add listening_get_first()

The current listening_get_next() is overloaded by passing
NULL to the 2nd arg, like listening_get_next(seq, NULL), to
mean get_first().

This patch moves some logic from the listening_get_next() into
a new function listening_get_first().  It will be equivalent
to the current established_get_first() and established_get_next()
setup.  get_first() is to find a non empty bucket and return
the first sk.  get_next() is to find the next sk of the current
bucket and then resorts to get_first() if the current bucket is
exhausted.

The next patch is to move the listener seq_file iteration from
listening_hash (port only) to lhash2 (port+addr).
Separating out listening_get_first() from listening_get_next()
here will make the following lhash2 changes cleaner and easier to
follow.
