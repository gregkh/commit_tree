drm/panel: panel-simple: Allow panel-simple be a DP AUX endpoint device

The panel-simple driver can already have devices instantiated as
platform devices or MIPI DSI devices. Let's add a 3rd way to
instantiate it: as DP AUX endpoint devices.

At the moment there is no benefit to instantiating it in this way,
but:
- In the next patch we'll give it access to the DDC channel via the DP
  AUX bus.
- Possibly in the future we may use this channel to configure the
  backlight.
