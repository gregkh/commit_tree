dpaa2-switch: rename dpaa2_switch_tc_parse_action to specify the ACL

Until now, the dpaa2_switch_tc_parse_action() function was used for all
the supported tc actions since all of them were implemented by adding
ACL table entries. In the next commits, the dpaa2-switch driver will
gain mirroring support which is not using the same HW feature.

Make sure that we specify the ACL in the function name so that we make
it clear that it's only used for specific actions.
