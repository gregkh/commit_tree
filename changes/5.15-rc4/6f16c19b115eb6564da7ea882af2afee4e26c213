ALSA: lx6464es: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch converts the resource management in PCI lx6464es driver
with devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is
converted with the corresponding devres helper, and the card object
release is managed now via card->private_free instead of a lowlevel
snd_device.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
