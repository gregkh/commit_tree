pinctrl: renesas: rcar: Avoid changing PUDn when disabling bias

When disabling pin bias, there is no need to touch the LSI pin
pull-up/down control register (PUDn), which selects between pull-up and
pull-down.  Just disabling the pull-up/down function through the LSI pin
pull-enable register (PUENn) is sufficient.
