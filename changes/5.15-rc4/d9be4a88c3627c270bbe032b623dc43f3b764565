ASoC: SOF: imx: imx8m: Bar index is only valid for IRAM and SRAM types

i.MX8 only uses SOF_FW_BLK_TYPE_IRAM (1) and SOF_FW_BLK_TYPE_SRAM (3)
bars, everything else is left as 0 in sdev->bar[] array.

If a broken or purposefully crafted firmware image is loaded with other
types of FW_BLK_TYPE then a kernel crash can be triggered.

Make sure that only IRAM/SRAM type is converted to bar index.
