usb: gadget: u_ether: fix a potential null pointer dereference

f_ncm tx timeout can call us with null skb to flush
a pending frame.  In this case skb is NULL to begin
with but ceases to be null after dev->wrap() completes.

In such a case in->maxpacket will be read, even though
we've failed to check that 'in' is not NULL.

Though I've never observed this fail in practice,
however the 'flush operation' simply does not make sense with
a null usb IN endpoint - there's nowhere to flush to...
(note that we're the gadget/device, and IN is from the point
 of view of the host, so here IN actually means outbound...)
