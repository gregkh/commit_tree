block: remove alloc_disk and alloc_disk_node

Most drivers should use and have been converted to use blk_alloc_disk
and blk_mq_alloc_disk.  Only the scsi ULPs and dasd still allocate
a disk separately from the request_queue, so don't bother with
convenience macros for something that should not see significant
new users and remove these wrappers.
