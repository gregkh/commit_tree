x86/resctrl: Pass the schema to resctrl filesystem functions

Once the CDP resources are merged, there will be two struct
resctrl_schema for one struct rdt_resource. CDP becomes a type of
configuration that belongs to the schema.

Helpers like rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps() need access to the schema to query
the configuration (or configurations) based on schema properties.

Change these functions to take a struct schema instead of the struct
rdt_resource. All the modified functions are part of the filesystem code
that will move to /fs/resctrl once it is possible to support a second
architecture.
