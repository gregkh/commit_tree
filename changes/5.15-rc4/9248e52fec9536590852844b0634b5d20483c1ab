locking/atomic: simplify non-atomic wrappers

Since the non-atomic arch_*() bitops use plain accesses, they are
implicitly instrumnted by the compiler, and we work around this in the
instrumented wrappers to avoid double instrumentation.

It's simpler to avoid the wrappers entirely, and use the preprocessor to
alias the arch_*() bitops to their regular versions, removing the need
for checks in the instrumented wrappers.
