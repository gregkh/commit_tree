platform/x86: ISST: Fix optimization with use of numa

When numa is used to map CPU to PCI device, the optimized path to read
from cached data is not working and still calls _isst_if_get_pci_dev().

The reason is that when caching the mapping, numa information is not
available as it is read later. So move the assignment of
isst_cpu_info[cpu].numa_node before calling _isst_if_get_pci_dev().
