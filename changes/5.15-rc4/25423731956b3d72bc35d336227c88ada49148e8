soc: mediatek: mmsys: Fix missing UFOE component in mt8173 table routing

The UFOE (data compression engine) component needs to be enabled to have
the imgtec gpu driver working. If we don't enable it we see a black screen.
Looks like when we switched to use and array for setting the routing
registers in commit 440147639ac7 ("soc: mediatek: mmsys: Use an array for
setting the routing registers") we missed to add this component in the new
routing table, it was present before that commit, so fix it by adding
this component in the mt8173 routing table.
