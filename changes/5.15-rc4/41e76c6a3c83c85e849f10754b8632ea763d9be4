nbd: use shifts rather than multiplies

commit fad7cd3310db ("nbd: add the check to prevent overflow in
__nbd_ioctl()") raised an issue from the fallback helpers added in
commit f0907827a8a9 ("compiler.h: enable builtin overflow checkers and
add fallback code")

ERROR: modpost: "__divdi3" [drivers/block/nbd.ko] undefined!

As Stephen Rothwell notes:
  The added check_mul_overflow() call is being passed 64 bit values.
  COMPILER_HAS_GENERIC_BUILTIN_OVERFLOW is not set for this build (see
  include/linux/overflow.h).

Specifically, the helpers for checking whether the results of a
multiplication overflowed (__unsigned_mul_overflow,
__signed_add_overflow) use the division operator when
!COMPILER_HAS_GENERIC_BUILTIN_OVERFLOW.  This is problematic for 64b
operands on 32b hosts.

This was fixed upstream by
commit 76ae847497bc ("Documentation: raise minimum supported version of
GCC to 5.1")
which is not suitable to be backported to stable.

Further, __builtin_mul_overflow() would emit a libcall to a
compiler-rt-only symbol when compiling with clang < 14 for 32b targets.

ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: __mulodi4

In order to keep stable buildable with GCC 4.9 and clang < 14, modify
struct nbd_config to instead track the number of bits of the block size;
reconstructing the block size using runtime checked shifts that are not
problematic for those compilers and in a ways that can be backported to
stable.

In nbd_set_size, we do validate that the value of blksize must be a
power of two (POT) and is in the range of [512, PAGE_SIZE] (both
inclusive).

This does modify the debugfs interface.
