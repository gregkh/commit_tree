thermal/core: Potential buffer overflow in thermal_build_list_of_policies()

After printing the list of thermal governors, then this function prints
a newline character.  The problem is that "size" has not been updated
after printing the last governor.  This means that it can write one
character (the NUL terminator) beyond the end of the buffer.

Get rid of the "size" variable and just use "PAGE_SIZE - count" directly.
