Revert "media: device property: Call fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id() for fwnode->secondary"

This reverts commit acd418bfcfc415cf5e6414b6d1c6acfec850f290. Checking for
endpoints against fwnode->secondary in fwnode_graph_get_next_endpoint() is
a better way to do this since that function is also used in a bunch of
other places, for instance sensor drivers checking that they do have an
endpoint connected during probe.

This reversion depends on the previous patch in this series, "device property:
Check fwnode->secondary in fwnode_graph_get_next_endpoint()".
