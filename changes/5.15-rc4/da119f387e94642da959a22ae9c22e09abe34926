vfio/fsl: Move to the device set infrastructure

FSL uses the internal reflck to implement the open_device() functionality,
conversion to the core code is straightforward.

The decision on which set to be part of is trivially based on the
is_fsl_mc_bus_dprc() and we use a 'struct device *' pointer as the set_id.

The dev_set lock is protecting the interrupts setup. The FSL MC devices
are using MSIs and only the DPRC device is allocating the MSIs from the
MSI domain. The other devices just take interrupts from a pool. The lock
is protecting the access to this pool.
