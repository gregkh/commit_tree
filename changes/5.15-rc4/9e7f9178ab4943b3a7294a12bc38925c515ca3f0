PCI: hv: Set up MSI domain at bridge probing time

Since PCI_HYPERV depends on PCI_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN which selects
GENERIC_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN, we can use dev_set_msi_domain() to set up the
MSI domain at probing time, and this works for both x86 and ARM64.

Therefore use it as the preparation for ARM64 Hyper-V PCI support.

As a result, no longer need to maintain ->fwnode in x86 specific
pci_sysdata, and make hv_pcibus_device own it instead.
