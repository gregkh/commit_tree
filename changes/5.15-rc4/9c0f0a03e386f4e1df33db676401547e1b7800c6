ocfs2: drop acl cache for directories too

ocfs2_data_convert_worker() is currently dropping any cached acl info
for FILE before down-converting meta lock.  It should also drop for
DIRECTORY.  Otherwise the second acl lookup returns the cached one (from
VFS layer) which could be already stale.

The problem we are seeing is that the acl changes on one node doesn't
get refreshed on other nodes in the following case:

  Node 1                    Node 2
  --------------            ----------------
  getfacl dir1

                            getfacl dir1    <-- this is OK

  setfacl -m u:user1:rwX dir1
  getfacl dir1   <-- see the change for user1

                            getfacl dir1    <-- can't see change for user1
