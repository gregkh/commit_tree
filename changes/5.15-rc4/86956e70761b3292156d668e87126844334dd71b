s390/vfio-ap: replace open coded locks for VFIO_GROUP_NOTIFY_SET_KVM notification

It was pointed out during an unrelated patch review that locks should not
be open coded - i.e., writing the algorithm of a standard lock in a
function instead of using a lock from the standard library. The setting and
testing of a busy flag and sleeping on a wait_event is the same thing
a lock does. The open coded locks are invisible to lockdep, so potential
locking problems are not detected.

This patch removes the open coded locks used during
VFIO_GROUP_NOTIFY_SET_KVM notification. The busy flag
and wait queue were introduced to resolve a possible circular locking
dependency reported by lockdep when starting a secure execution guest
configured with AP adapters and domains. Reversing the order in which
the kvm->lock mutex and matrix_dev->lock mutex are locked resolves the
issue reported by lockdep, thus enabling the removal of the open coded
locks.
