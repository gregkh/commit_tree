rtw88: 8822ce: set CLKREQ# signal to low during suspend

We find the power sequence of system suspend flow don't meet
the criteria when using 8822CE-VR chip by rfe-type 6, because the
reference clock form host is sometimes late. To avoid the behavoir,
we keep CLKREQ# signal to low during suspend to make sure the reference
clock arrival in time.
