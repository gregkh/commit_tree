arm64: dts: renesas: salvator-x(s): Factor out SATA parts

Move the common parts related to the SATA interface on Salvator-X(S)
boards to salvator-common.dtsi and salvator-xs.dtsi, to reduce current
and avoid future duplication of board descriptions.

As this interface is not present on all SoCs that can be found on
Salvator-X(S), but only on R-Car H3 and M3-N, its descriptions are
protected by the preprocessor symbol SOC_HAS_SATA, defined in
r8a77951.dtsi and r8a77965.dtsi.
