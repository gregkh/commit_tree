crypto: tcrypt - Fix missing return value check

There are several places where the return value check of crypto_aead_setkey
and crypto_aead_setauthsize were lost. It is necessary to add these checks.

At the same time, move the crypto_aead_setauthsize() call out of the loop,
and only need to call it once after load transform.
