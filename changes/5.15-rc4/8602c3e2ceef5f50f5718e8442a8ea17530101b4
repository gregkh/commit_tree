cifsd: Do not use 0 or 0xFFFFFFFF for TreeID

Returning TreeID=0 is valid behaviour according to [MS-SMB2] 2.2.1.2:

  TreeId (4 bytes): Uniquely identifies the tree connect for the command.
  This MUST be 0 for the SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Request. The TreeId can be
  any unsigned 32-bit integer that is received from a previous
  SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response. TreeId SHOULD be set to 0 for the
  following commands:
   [...]

However, some client implementations reject it as invalid. Windows10
assigns ids starting from 1, and samba4 returns a random uint32_t
which suggests there may be other clients that consider it is
invalid behaviour.
