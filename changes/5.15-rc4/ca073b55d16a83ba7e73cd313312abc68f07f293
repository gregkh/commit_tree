iommu/io-pgtable: Introduce map_pages() as a page table op

Mapping memory into io-pgtables follows the same semantics
that unmapping memory used to follow (i.e. a buffer will be
mapped one page block per call to the io-pgtable code). This
means that it can be optimized in the same way that unmapping
memory was, so add a map_pages() callback to the io-pgtable
ops structure, so that a range of pages of the same size
can be mapped within the same call.
