net: bridge: vlan: fix global vlan option range dumping

When global vlan options are equal sequentially we compress them in a
range to save space and reduce processing time. In order to have the
proper range end id we need to update range_end if the options are equal
otherwise we get ranges with the same end vlan id as the start.
