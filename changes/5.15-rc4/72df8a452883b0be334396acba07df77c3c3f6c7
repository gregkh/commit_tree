scsi: lpfc: Add support for cm enablement buffer

As part of the cmf framework, the firmware maintains a table with
congestion related state information, specifically whether enabled and if
enabled, whether monitoring or actively managing congestion.

Add definition of the table and add support to read the table from the
adapter and determine if it is enabled. In support of this, the READ_OBJECT
mailbox command definition is added to the driver.
