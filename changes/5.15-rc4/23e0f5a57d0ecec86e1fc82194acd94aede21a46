drm/etnaviv: stop abusing mmu_context as FE running marker

While the DMA frontend can only be active when the MMU context is set, the
reverse isn't necessarily true, as the frontend can be stopped while the
MMU state is kept. Stop treating mmu_context being set as a indication that
the frontend is running and instead add a explicit property.
