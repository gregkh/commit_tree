kunit: tool: make --raw_output support only showing kunit output

--raw_output is nice, but it would be nicer if could show only output
after KUnit tests have started.

So change the flag to allow specifying a string ('kunit').
Make it so `--raw_output` alone will default to `--raw_output=all` and
have the same original behavior.

Drop the small kunit_parser.raw_output() function since it feels wrong
to put it in "kunit_parser.py" when the point of it is to not parse
anything.

E.g.

$ ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --raw_output=kunit
