cpuset: Honour task_cpu_possible_mask() in guarantee_online_cpus()

Asymmetric systems may not offer the same level of userspace ISA support
across all CPUs, meaning that some applications cannot be executed by
some CPUs. As a concrete example, upcoming arm64 big.LITTLE designs do
not feature support for 32-bit applications on both clusters.

Modify guarantee_online_cpus() to take task_cpu_possible_mask() into
account when trying to find a suitable set of online CPUs for a given
task. This will avoid passing an invalid mask to set_cpus_allowed_ptr()
during ->attach() and will subsequently allow the cpuset hierarchy to be
taken into account when forcefully overriding the affinity mask for a
task which requires migration to a compatible CPU.
