habanalabs: expose server type in INFO IOCTL

Add the server type property to the hl_info_hw_ip_info structure
that is exposed to the user via the INFO IOCTL.

This is needed by the userspace s/w stack to know the connections map
of the internal links that connect the ASIC among themselves inside the
server.

The F/W will tell us, as part of the NIC information, the server type
that the GAUDI is located in.
