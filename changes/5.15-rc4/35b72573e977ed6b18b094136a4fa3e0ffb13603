fscache: Fix cookie key hashing

The current hash algorithm used for hashing cookie keys is really bad,
producing almost no dispersion (after a test kernel build, ~30000 files
were split over just 18 out of the 32768 hash buckets).

Borrow the full_name_hash() hash function into fscache to do the hashing
for cookie keys and, in the future, volume keys.

I don't want to use full_name_hash() as-is because I want the hash value to
be consistent across arches and over time as the hash value produced may
get used on disk.

I can also optimise parts of it away as the key will always be a padded
array of aligned 32-bit words.
