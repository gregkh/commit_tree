hrtimer: Force clock_was_set() handling for the HIGHRES=n, NOHZ=y case

When CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS is disabled, but NOHZ is enabled then
clock_was_set() is not doing anything. With HIGHRES=n the kernel relies on
the periodic tick to update the clock offsets, but when NOHZ is enabled and
active then CPUs which are in a deep idle sleep do not have a periodic tick
which means the expiry of timers affected by clock_was_set() can be
arbitrarily delayed up to the point where the CPUs are brought out of idle
again.

Make the clock_was_set() logic unconditionaly available so that idle CPUs
are kicked out of idle to handle the update.
