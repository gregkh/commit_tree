fs/ntfs3: Restyle comments to better align with kernel-doc

Capitalize comments and end with period for better reading.

Also function comments are now little more kernel-doc style. This way we
can easily convert them to kernel-doc style if we want. Note that these
are not yet complete with this style. Example function comments start
with /* and in kernel-doc style they start /**.

Use imperative mood in function descriptions.

Change words like ntfs -> NTFS, linux -> Linux.

Use "we" not "I" when commenting code.
