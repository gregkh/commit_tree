kbuild: Switch to 'f' variants of integrated assembler flag

It has been brought up a few times in various code reviews that clang
3.5 introduced -f{,no-}integrated-as as the preferred way to enable and
disable the integrated assembler, mentioning that -{no-,}integrated-as
are now considered legacy flags.

Switch the kernel over to using those variants in case there is ever a
time where clang decides to remove the non-'f' variants of the flag.

Also, fix a typo in a comment ("intergrated" -> "integrated").
