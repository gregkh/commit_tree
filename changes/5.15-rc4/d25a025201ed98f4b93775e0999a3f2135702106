clocksource: Make clocksource watchdog test safe for slow-HZ systems

The clocksource watchdog test sets a local JIFFIES_SHIFT macro and assumes
that HZ is >= 100. For smaller HZ values this shift value is too large and
causes undefined behaviour.

Move the HZ-based definitions of JIFFIES_SHIFT from kernel/time/jiffies.c
to kernel/time/tick-internal.h so the clocksource watchdog test can utilize
them, which makes it work correctly with all HZ values.
