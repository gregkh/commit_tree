bpf: Reconfigure libbpf docs to remove unversioned API

This removes the libbpf_api.rst file from the kernel documentation.
The intention for this file was to pull documentation from comments
above API functions in libbpf. However, due to limitations of the
kernel documentation system, this API documentation could not be
versioned, which is counterintuative to how users expect to use it.
There is also currently no doc comments, making this a blank page.

Once the kernel comment documentation is actually contributed, it
will still exist in the kernel repository, just in the code itself.

A seperate site is being spun up to generate documentaiton from those
comments in a way in which it can be versioned properly.

This also reconfigures the bpf documentation index page to make it
easier to sync to the previously mentioned documentaiton site.
