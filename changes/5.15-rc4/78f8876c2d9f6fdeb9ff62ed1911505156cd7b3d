io-wq: exclusively gate signal based exit on get_signal() return

io-wq threads block all signals, except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP. We should not
need any extra checking of signal_pending or fatal_signal_pending, rely
exclusively on whether or not get_signal() tells us to exit.

The original debugging of this issue led to the false positive that we
were exiting on non-fatal signals, but that is not the case. The issue
was around races with nr_workers accounting.
