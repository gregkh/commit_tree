mm: Fully initialize invalidate_lock, amend lock class later

The function __init_rwsem() is not part of the official API, it just a helper
function used by init_rwsem().
Changing the lock's class and name should be done by using
lockdep_set_class_and_name() after the has been fully initialized. The overhead
of the additional class struct and setting it twice is negligible and it works
across all locks.

Fully initialize the lock with init_rwsem() and then set the custom class and
name for the lock.
