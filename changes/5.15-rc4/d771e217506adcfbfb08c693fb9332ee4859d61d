samples: bpf: Add cpumap tracepoint statistics support

This consolidates retrieval and printing into the XDP sample helper. For
the kthread stats, it expands xdp_stats separately with its own per-CPU
stats. For cpumap enqueue, we display FROM->TO stats also with its
per-CPU stats.

The help out explains in detail the various aspects of the output.
