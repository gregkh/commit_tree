ice: add AQC get link topology handle support

Add AQC get link topology handle support. This is needed to determine
Direct Attach (DA) or backplane media type for PHY types that support
either. Get link topology handle cage node type request can be used to
determine if a cage is present or not. If a cage is present for PHY
types that supports both DA and backplane media type, then the media
type is DA, else the media type is backplane.
