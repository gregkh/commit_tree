iwlegacy: Check the return value of pcie_capability_read_*()

On failure pcie_capability_read_dword() sets it's last parameter, val
to 0. However, with Patch 14/14, it is possible that val is set to ~0 on
failure. This would introduce a bug because (x & x) == (~0 & x).

This bug can be avoided without changing the function's behaviour if the
return value of pcie_capability_read_dword is checked to confirm success.

Check the return value of pcie_capability_read_dword() to ensure success.
