usb: typec: tcpm: Add tcpm_queue_vdm_unlocked() helper

Various callers (all the typec_altmode_ops) take the port-lock just for
the tcpm_queue_vdm() call.

Add a new tcpm_queue_vdm_unlocked() helper which takes the lock, so that
its callers don't have to do this themselves.

This is a preparation patch for fixing an AB BA lock inversion between
the tcpm code and some altmode drivers.
