drm/i915/selftests: Flush the submission, not cancel it!

Use intel_engine_flush_submission() when we want to ensure that the
tasklet is run. tasklet_kill(), while it may ensure that an ongoing
tasklet is completed, also prevents the tasklet from running if it's
already scheduled and hasn't yet been run.
