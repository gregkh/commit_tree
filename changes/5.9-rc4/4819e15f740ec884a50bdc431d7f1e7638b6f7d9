x86/mm/32: Bring back vmalloc faulting on x86_32

One can not simply remove vmalloc faulting on x86-32. Upstream

	commit: 7f0a002b5a21 ("x86/mm: remove vmalloc faulting")

removed it on x86 alltogether because previously the
arch_sync_kernel_mappings() interface was introduced. This interface
added synchronization of vmalloc/ioremap page-table updates to all
page-tables in the system at creation time and was thought to make
vmalloc faulting obsolete.

But that assumption was incredibly naive.

It turned out that there is a race window between the time the vmalloc
or ioremap code establishes a mapping and the time it synchronizes
this change to other page-tables in the system.

During this race window another CPU or thread can establish a vmalloc
mapping which uses the same intermediate page-table entries (e.g. PMD
or PUD) and does no synchronization in the end, because it found all
necessary mappings already present in the kernel reference page-table.

But when these intermediate page-table entries are not yet
synchronized, the other CPU or thread will continue with a vmalloc
address that is not yet mapped in the page-table it currently uses,
causing an unhandled page fault and oops like below:

	BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: fe80c000
	#PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
	#PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
	*pde = 33183067 *pte = a8648163
	Oops: 0002 [#1] SMP
	CPU: 1 PID: 13514 Comm: cve-2017-17053 Tainted: G
	...

	 do_SYSENTER_32+0x15/0x20
	 entry_SYSENTER_32+0x9f/0xf2
	EIP: 0xb7eef549

So the arch_sync_kernel_mappings() interface is racy, but removing it
would mean to re-introduce the vmalloc_sync_all() interface, which is
even more awful. Keep arch_sync_kernel_mappings() in place and catch
the race condition in the page-fault handler instead.

Do a partial revert of above commit to get vmalloc faulting on x86-32
back in place.
