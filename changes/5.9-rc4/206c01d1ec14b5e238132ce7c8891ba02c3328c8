ARM: dts: ux500: Supply nodes for the other 2 AB8500 PWM devices

As per 'struct mfd_cell ab8500_devs[]' there are not 1, but 3 PWM
devices on the AB8500.  Until now, each of them have referenced
the same Device Tree node.  This change ensures each device has
their own.

Due to recent `dtc` checks [0], nodes cannot share the same node
name, so we are forced to rename the affected nodes by appending
their associated numeric 'bank ID'.

      /soc/prcmu@80157000/ab8500/ab8500-pwm: Duplicate node name
