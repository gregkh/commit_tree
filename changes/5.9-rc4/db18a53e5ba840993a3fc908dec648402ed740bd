blk-cgroup: remove blkcg_bio_issue_check

blkcg_bio_issue_check is a giant inline function that does three entirely
different things.  Factor out the blk-cgroup related bio initalization
into a new helper, and the open code the sequence in the only caller,
relying on the fact that all the actual functionality is stubbed out for
non-cgroup builds.
