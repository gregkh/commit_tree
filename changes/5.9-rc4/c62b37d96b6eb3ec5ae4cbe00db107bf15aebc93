block: move ->make_request_fn to struct block_device_operations

The make_request_fn is a little weird in that it sits directly in
struct request_queue instead of an operation vector.  Replace it with
a block_device_operations method called submit_bio (which describes much
better what it does).  Also remove the request_queue argument to it, as
the queue can be derived pretty trivially from the bio.
