scsi: ufs: No need to send Abort Task if the task in DB was cleared

If the bit corresponding to a task in the Doorbell register has been
cleared, no need to poll the status of the task on the device side and to
send an Abort Task TM. Instead, let it directly goto cleanup.

In addition, to keep original debug output, move the goto below the debug
print.
