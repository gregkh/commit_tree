PM / EM: introduce em_dev_register_perf_domain function

Add now function in the Energy Model framework which is going to support
new devices. This function will help in transition and make it smoother.
For now it still checks if the cpumask is a valid pointer, which will be
removed later when the new structures and infrastructure will be ready.
