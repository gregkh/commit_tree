usbip: tools: add in man page how to load the client's module

While the man page usbipd.8 already informs the user on which
kernel module has to be used on server side, the man page usbip.8
does not provide any equivalent information on client side.
Also, it could be hard for a newbie to identify the proper usbip
client kernel module, due to the name "vhci-hcd" that has no
immediate assonance with usbip.

Add in usbip.8 the command to add the module vhci-hcd, similarly
as it's already present in usbipd.8 for usbip-host.
While there, rephrase the description of the command "usbip list
--remote=server".
