remoteproc: stm32: Remove memory translation from DT parsing

Other than one has to be done after the other, there is no correlation
between memory translation and DT parsing.  As such move function
stm32_rproc_of_memory_translations() to stm32_rproc_probe() so that
stm32_rproc_parse_dt() can be extended to look for attach bindings
in a clean way.
