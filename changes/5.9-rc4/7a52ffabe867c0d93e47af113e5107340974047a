powerpc/powernv/pci: Always tear down DMA windows on PE release

Currently we have these two functions:

	pnv_pci_ioda2_release_dma_pe(), and
	pnv_pci_ioda2_release_pe_dma()

The first is used when tearing down VF PEs and the other is used for normal
devices. There's very little difference between the two though. The latter
(non-VF) will skip a call to pnv_pci_ioda2_unset_window() unless
CONFIG_IOMMU_API=y is set. There's no real point in doing this so fold the
two together.
