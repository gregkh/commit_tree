ice: port fix for chk_linearlize

This is a port of commit 248de22e638f ("i40e/i40evf: Account for frags
split over multiple descriptors in check linearize")

As part of testing workloads (read/write) using larger IO size (128K)
tx_timeout is observed and whenever it happens, it was due to
tx_linearize.
