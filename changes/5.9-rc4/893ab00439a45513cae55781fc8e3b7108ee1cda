kbuild: remove cc-option test of -fno-stack-protector

Some Makefiles already pass -fno-stack-protector unconditionally.
For example, arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/Makefile, arch/x86/xen/Makefile.

No problem report so far about hard-coding this option. So, we can
assume all supported compilers know -fno-stack-protector.

GCC 4.8 and Clang support this option (https://godbolt.org/z/_HDGzN)

Get rid of cc-option from -fno-stack-protector.

Remove CONFIG_CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE, which is always 'y'.

Note:
arch/mips/vdso/Makefile adds -fno-stack-protector twice, first
unconditionally, and second conditionally. I removed the second one.
