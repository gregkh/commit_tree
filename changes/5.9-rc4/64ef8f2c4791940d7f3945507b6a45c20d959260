powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Move cpumask file to top folder of hv-24x7 driver

Commit 792f73f747b8 ("powerpc/hv-24x7: Add sysfs files inside hv-24x7
device to show cpumask") added cpumask file as part of hv-24x7 driver
inside the interface folder. The cpumask file is supposed to be in the
top folder of the PMU driver in order to make hotplug work.

This patch fixes that issue and creates new group 'cpumask_attr_group'
to add cpumask file and make sure it added in top folder.

  command:# cat /sys/devices/hv_24x7/cpumask
  0
