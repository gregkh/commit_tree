net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Pass GENMASK() signed bits

Oddly, GENMASK() requires signed bit numbers, so that it can compare
them for < 0. If passed an unsigned type, we get warnings about the
test never being true. There is no danger of overflow here, udf is
always a u8, so there is plenty of space when expanding to an int.
