scsi: iscsi: Delay freeing target_id

If we are doing async removal of the session, we could be doing a
scsi_remove_target from the removal workqueue, and for the offload case we
could be doing a new session addition and scan to the same host. The
add/scan might then end up trying to use the target_id of the target we are
removing.

This patch just has a delay the freeing of the target_id until after the
scsi_remove_target has completed, so we know it's no longer in use.
