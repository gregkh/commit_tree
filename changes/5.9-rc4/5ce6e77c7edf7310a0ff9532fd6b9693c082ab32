bpf: Implement bpf iterator for sock local storage map

The bpf iterator for bpf sock local storage map
is implemented. User space interacts with sock
local storage map with fd as a key and storage value.
In kernel, passing fd to the bpf program does not
really make sense. In this case, the sock itself is
passed to bpf program.
