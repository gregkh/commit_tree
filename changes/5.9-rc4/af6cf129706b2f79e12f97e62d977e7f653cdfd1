perf/x86: Expose CPUID enumeration bits for arch LBR

The LBR capabilities of Architecture LBR are retrieved from the CPUID
enumeration once at boot time. The capabilities have to be saved for
future usage.

Several new fields are added into structure x86_pmu to indicate the
capabilities. The fields will be used in the following patches.
