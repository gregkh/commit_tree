nvme-tcp: serialize controller teardown sequences

In the timeout handler we may need to complete a request because the
request that timed out may be an I/O that is a part of a serial sequence
of controller teardown or initialization. In order to complete the
request, we need to fence any other context that may compete with us
and complete the request that is timing out.

In this case, we could have a potential double completion in case
a hard-irq or a different competing context triggered error recovery
and is running inflight request cancellation concurrently with the
timeout handler.

Protect using a ctrl teardown_lock to serialize contexts that may
complete a cancelled request due to error recovery or a reset.
