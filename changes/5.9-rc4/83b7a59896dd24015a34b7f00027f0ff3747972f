fanotify: add basic support for FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID

For now, the flag is mutually exclusive with FAN_REPORT_FID.
Events include a single info record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID
with a directory file handle.

For now, events are only reported for:
- Directory modification events
- Events on children of a watching directory
- Events on directory objects

Soon, we will add support for reporting the parent directory fid
for events on non-directories with filesystem/mount mark and
support for reporting both parent directory fid and child fid.
