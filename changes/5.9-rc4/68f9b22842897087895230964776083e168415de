pm-graph v5.7 - important s2idle fixes

Important fixes:

 - in s2idle, use timekeeping_freeze trace mark instead of
   machine_suspend to denote entry into s2idle mode.

 - in s2idle, use machine_suspend trace mark to create a new virtual
   device called "s2idle_enter_<n>x". It denotes an s2idle_enter call
   loop of <n> iterations where s2idle was never actually achieved.
   It isn't counted as "freeze time" in the header.

 - in s2idle, only show multiple freeze times if s2idle went in and
   out of resume_noirq. Otherwise multiple freezes are shown with
   "waking" time subtracted (waking time is time spent outside s2idle
   dealing with wakeups).

 - in s2idle summaries, include "FREEZEWAKE" as an issue when at
   least 1ms is spent waking from s2idle. A clean run should only
   wake for the rtc timer.

 - add support for device callbacks with matching names in the same
   phase. In rare cases some devices register multiple callbacks from
   separate drivers using the same name. Without this fix only one is
   shown.

 - add kparamsfmt string back to fix bootgraph

General updates:

 - when suspend_machine is missing, error says "failed in
   suspend_machine"

 - extract target count/time and add to summary title if -multi
   used

 - include any instances of "timeout" in dmesg as issues to be
   logged.

 - fix ftrace parse to handle any number of flags (instead of
   just 4).

 - remove sync/async_device string from device detail, remains in
   hover.

 - when using callgraph (-f) add driver name to callgraph titles.
