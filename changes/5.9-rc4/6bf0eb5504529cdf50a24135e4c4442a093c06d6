sbitmap: Consider cleared bits in sbitmap_bitmap_show()

sbitmap works by maintaining separate bitmaps of set and cleared bits.
The set bits are cleared in a batch, to save the burden of continuously
locking the "word" map to unset.

sbitmap_bitmap_show() only shows the set bits (in "word"), which is not
too much use, so mask out the cleared bits.
