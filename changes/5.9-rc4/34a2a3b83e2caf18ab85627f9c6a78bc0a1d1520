net/intel: remove driver versions from Intel drivers

As with other networking drivers, remove the unnecessary driver version
from the Intel drivers. The ethtool driver information and module version
will then report the kernel version instead.

For ixgbe, i40e and ice drivers, the driver passes the driver version to
the firmware to confirm that we are up and running.  So we now pass the
value of UTS_RELEASE to the firmware.  This adminq call is required per
the HAS document.  The Device then sends an indication to the BMC that the
PF driver is present. This is done using Host NC Driver Status Indication
in NC-SI Get Link command or via the Host Network Controller Driver Status
Change AEN.

What the BMC may do with this information is implementation-dependent, but
this is a standard NC-SI 1.1 command we honor per the HAS.
