media: v4l2-async: Accept endpoints and devices for fwnode matching

fwnode matching was designed to match on nodes corresponding to a
device. Some drivers, however, needed to match on endpoints, and have
passed endpoint fwnodes to v4l2-async. This works when both the subdev
and the notifier use the same fwnode types (endpoint or device), but
makes drivers that use different types incompatible.

Fix this by extending the fwnode match to handle fwnodes of different
types. When the types (deduced from the presence of remote endpoints)
are different, retrieve the device fwnode for the side that provides an
endpoint fwnode, and compare it with the device fwnode provided by the
other side. This allows interoperability between all drivers, regardless
of which type of fwnode they use for matching.
