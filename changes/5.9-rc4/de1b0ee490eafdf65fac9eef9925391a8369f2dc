block: ensure bdi->io_pages is always initialized

If a driver leaves the limit settings as the defaults, then we don't
initialize bdi->io_pages. This means that file systems may need to
work around bdi->io_pages == 0, which is somewhat messy.

Initialize the default value just like we do for ->ra_pages.
