drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Check the regmap return value when setting a GPIO

The ti_sn_bridge_gpio_set() got the return value of
regmap_update_bits() but didn't check it.  The function can't return
an error value, but we should at least print a warning if it didn't
work.

This fixes a compiler warning about setting "ret" but not using it.
