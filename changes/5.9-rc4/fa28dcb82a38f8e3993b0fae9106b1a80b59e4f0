bpf: Introduce helper bpf_get_task_stack()

Introduce helper bpf_get_task_stack(), which dumps stack trace of given
task. This is different to bpf_get_stack(), which gets stack track of
current task. One potential use case of bpf_get_task_stack() is to call
it from bpf_iter__task and dump all /proc/<pid>/stack to a seq_file.

bpf_get_task_stack() uses stack_trace_save_tsk() instead of
get_perf_callchain() for kernel stack. The benefit of this choice is that
stack_trace_save_tsk() doesn't require changes in arch/. The downside of
using stack_trace_save_tsk() is that stack_trace_save_tsk() dumps the
stack trace to unsigned long array. For 32-bit systems, we need to
translate it to u64 array.
