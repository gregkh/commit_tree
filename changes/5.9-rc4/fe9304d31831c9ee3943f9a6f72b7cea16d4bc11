KVM: x86: drop superfluous mmu_check_root() from fast_pgd_switch()

The mmu_check_root() check in fast_pgd_switch() seems to be
superfluous: when GPA is outside of the visible range
cached_root_available() will fail for non-direct roots
(as we can't have a matching one on the list) and we don't
seem to care for direct ones.

Also, raising #TF immediately when a non-existent GFN is written to CR3
doesn't seem to mach architectural behavior. Drop the check.
