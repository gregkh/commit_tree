selftests/bpf: Fix test_lwt_seg6local.sh hangs

OpenBSD netcat (Debian patchlevel 1.195-2) does not seem to react to
SIGINT for whatever reason, causing prefix.pl to hang after
test_lwt_seg6local.sh exits due to netcat inheriting
test_lwt_seg6local.sh's file descriptors.

Fix by using SIGTERM instead.
