tools/bpf: Sync btf_ids.h to tools

Sync kernel header btf_ids.h to tools directory.
Also define macro CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF before
including btf_ids.h in prog_tests/resolve_btfids.c
since non-stub definitions for BTF_ID_LIST etc. macros
are defined under CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF. This
prevented test_progs from failing.
