powerpc/perf: Ignore the BHRB kernel address filtering for P10

Commit bb19af816025 ("powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak to
userspace via BHRB buffer") added a check in bhrb_read() to filter
the kernel address from BHRB buffer. This patch modified it to avoid
that check for PowerISA v3.1 based processors, since PowerISA v3.1
allows only MSR[PR]=1 address to be written to BHRB buffer.
