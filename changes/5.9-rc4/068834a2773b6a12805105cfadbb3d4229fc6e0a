USB: quirks: Ignore duplicate endpoint on Sound Devices MixPre-D

The Sound Devices MixPre-D audio card suffers from the same defect
as the Sound Devices USBPre2: an endpoint shared between a normal
audio interface and a vendor-specific interface, in violation of the
USB spec.  Since the USB core now treats duplicated endpoints as bugs
and ignores them, the audio endpoint isn't available and the card
can't be used for audio capture.

Along the same lines as commit bdd1b147b802 ("USB: quirks: blacklist
duplicate ep on Sound Devices USBPre2"), this patch adds a quirks
entry saying to ignore ep5in for interface 1, leaving it available for
use with standard audio interface 2.
