s390/ptrace: fix storage key handling

The key member of the runtime instrumentation control block contains
only the access key, not the complete storage key. Therefore the value
must be shifted by four bits. Since existing user space does not
necessarily query and set the access key correctly, just ignore the
user space provided key and use the correct one.
Note: this is only relevant for debugging purposes in case somebody
compiles a kernel with a default storage access key set to a value not
equal to zero.
