s390/zcrypt: code beautification and struct field renames

Some beautifications related to the internal only used
struct ap_message and related code. Instead of one int carrying
only the special flag now a u32 flags field is used.

At struct CPRBX the pointers to additional data are now marked
with __user. This caused some changes needed on code, where
these structs are also used within the zcrypt misc functions.

The ica_rsa_* structs now use the generic types __u8, __u32, ...
instead of char, unsigned int.

zcrypt_msg6 and zcrypt_msg50 use min_t() instead of min().
