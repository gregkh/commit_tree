mm, oom: show process exiting information in __oom_kill_process()

When the OOM killer finds a victim and tryies to kill it, if the victim is
already exiting, the task mm will be NULL and no process will be killed.
But the dump_header() has been already executed, so it will be strange to
dump so much information without killing a process.  We'd better show some
helpful information to indicate why this happens.
