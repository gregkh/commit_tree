sched,tracing: Convert to sched_set_fifo()

One module user of sched_setscheduler() was overlooked and is
obviously causing build failures.

Convert ring_buffer_benchmark to use sched_set_fifo_low() when fifo==1
and sched_set_fifo() when fifo==2. This is a bit of an abuse, but it
makes the thing 'work' again.

Specifically, it enables all combinations that were previously
possible:

  producer higher than consumer
  consumer higher than producer
