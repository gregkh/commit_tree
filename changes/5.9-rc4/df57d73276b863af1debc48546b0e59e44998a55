mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix SDHCI_RESET_ALL for CQHCI for Intel GLK-based controllers

For Intel controllers, SDHCI_RESET_ALL resets also CQHCI registers.
Normally, SDHCI_RESET_ALL is not used while CQHCI is enabled, but that can
happen on the error path. e.g. if mmc_cqe_recovery() fails, mmc_blk_reset()
is called which, for a eMMC that does not support HW Reset, will cycle the
bus power and the driver will perform SDHCI_RESET_ALL.

So whenever performing SDHCI_RESET_ALL ensure CQHCI is deactivated.
That will force the driver to reinitialize CQHCI when it is next used.

A similar change was done already for sdhci-msm, and other drivers using
CQHCI might benefit from a similar change, if they also have CQHCI reset
by SDHCI_RESET_ALL.
