serial: samsung: Removes the IRQ not found warning

In few older Samsung SoCs like s3c2410, s3c2412
and s3c2440, UART IP is having 2 interrupt lines.
However, in other SoCs like s3c6400, s5pv210,
exynos5433, and exynos4210 UART is having only 1
interrupt line. Due to this, "platform_get_irq(platdev, 1)"
call in the driver gives the following false-positive error:
"IRQ index 1 not found" on newer SoC's.

This patch adds the condition to check for Tx interrupt
only for the those SoC's which have 2 interrupt lines.
