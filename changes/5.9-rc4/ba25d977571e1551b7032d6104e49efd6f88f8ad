drm/i915/gvt: Do not destroy ppgtt_mm during vGPU D3->D0.

When system enters S3 state, device enters D3 state while RAM remains
powered. From vGPU/GVT perspective, ppgtt_mm is residual in guest memory
during vGPU in D3 state, so that when guest state transits from S3->S0,
ppgtt_mm can be re-used and no need rebuild.

Previous implementation invalidate and destroy ppgtt_mm at DMLR,
regardless the power state transition is S0->S3->S0 (guest suspend or
resume) or OFF->S0 (normal boot/reboot), invalidate and destroy ppgtt_mm
is unnecessary in the former transition case.

The patch saves the vGPU D3/D0 transition state when guest writes the
PCI_PM_CTRL in vGPU's configure space, then in later DMLR, GVT can decide
whether or not invalidate and destroy ppgtt_mm is required. The
d3_entered flags is reset after DMLR.

To test this feature, make sure S3 is enabled in QEMU parameters:
i440fx: PIIX4_PM.disable_s3=0
q35: ICH9-LPC.disable_s3=0
Also need enable sleep option in guest OS if it's disabled.

v2:
- Revise commit message to more accurate description. (Kevin)
- Split patch by logic. (Zhenyu)
