firmware: arm_scmi: Use HAVE_ARM_SMCCC_DISCOVERY instead of ARM_PSCI_FW

Commit e5bfb21d98b6 ("firmware: smccc: Add HAVE_ARM_SMCCC_DISCOVERY to
identify SMCCC v1.1 and above") introduced new config option to identify
the availability of SMCCC discoverability of version and features
transparently hiding the indirect dependency on ARM_PSCI_FW.

Commit 5a897e3ab429 ("firmware: arm_scmi: fix psci dependency") just
worked around the build dependency making SCMI SMC/HVC transport depend
on ARM_PSCI_FW at the time. Since it really just relies on SMCCC directly
and not on ARM_PSCI_FW, let us move to use CONFIG_HAVE_ARM_SMCCC_DISCOVERY
instead of CONFIG_ARM_PSCI_FW.
