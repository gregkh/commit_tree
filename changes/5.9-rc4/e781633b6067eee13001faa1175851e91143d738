arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for Sony Xperia XA2/Plus/Ultra (Nile platform)

Add device tree support for the Sony Xperia XA2, XA2 Plus and
XA2 Ultra smartphones. They are all based on the Sony Nile
platform (sdm630) and share a lot of common code. The
differences are really minor, so a Nile-common DTSI
has been created to reduce clutter.

XA2 - Pioneer
XA2 Plus - Voyager
XA2 Ultra - Discovery

The boards currently support:
* Screen console
* SDHCI
* I2C
* pstore log dump
* GPIO keys
* PSCI idle states
