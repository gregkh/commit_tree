fanotify: create overflow event type

The special overflow event is allocated as struct fanotify_path_event,
but with a null path.

Use a special event type to identify the overflow event, so the helper
fanotify_has_event_path() will always indicate a non null path.

Allocating the overflow event doesn't need any of the fancy stuff in
fanotify_alloc_event(), so create a simplified helper for allocating the
overflow event.

There is also no need to store and report the pid with an overflow event.
