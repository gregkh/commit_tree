leds: lp55xx: Fix file permissions to use DEVICE_ATTR macros

Fix the checkpatch warnings for the use of the file permission macros.
In converting the file permissions to the DEVICE_ATTR_XX macros the
call back function names needed to be updated within the code.

This means that the lp55xx_ needed to be dropped in the name to keep in
harmony with the ABI documentation.
