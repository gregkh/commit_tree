psi: eliminate kthread_worker from psi trigger scheduling mechanism

Each psi group requires a dedicated kthread_delayed_work and
kthread_worker. Since no other work can be performed using psi_group's
kthread_worker, the same result can be obtained using a task_struct and
a timer directly. This makes psi triggering simpler by removing lists
and locks involved with kthread_worker usage and eliminates the need for
poll_scheduled atomic use in the hot path.
