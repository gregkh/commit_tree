net: disable netpoll on fresh napis

napi_disable() makes sure to set the NAPI_STATE_NPSVC bit to prevent
netpoll from accessing rings before init is complete. However, the
same is not done for fresh napi instances in netif_napi_add(),
even though we expect NAPI instances to be added as disabled.

This causes crashes during driver reconfiguration (enabling XDP,
changing the channel count) - if there is any printk() after
netif_napi_add() but before napi_enable().

To ensure memory ordering is correct we need to use RCU accessors.
