mfd: core: Fix double-free in mfd_remove_devices_fn()

The pdev.mfd_cell is released by platform_device_release(), which is
invoked by platform_device_unregister(). Hence mfd_remove_devices_fn()
shouldn't release the cell variable. The double-free bug is reported KASAN
during of MFD driver module removal.
