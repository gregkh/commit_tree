libbpf: Make bpf_endian co-exist with vmlinux.h

Make bpf_endian.h compatible with vmlinux.h. It is a frequent request from
users wanting to use bpf_endian.h in their BPF applications using CO-RE and
vmlinux.h.

To achieve that, re-implement byte swap macros and drop all the header
includes. This way it can be used both with linux header includes, as well as
with a vmlinux.h.
