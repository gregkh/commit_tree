seqlock: seqcount_t latch: End read sections with read_seqcount_retry()

The seqcount_t latch reader example at the raw_write_seqcount_latch()
kernel-doc comment ends the latch read section with a manual smp memory
barrier and sequence counter comparison.

This is technically correct, but it is suboptimal: read_seqcount_retry()
already contains the same logic of an smp memory barrier and sequence
counter comparison.

End the latch read critical section example with read_seqcount_retry().
