iwlwifi: yoyo: don't print failure if debug firmware is missing

Missing this firmware is not fatal, my wifi card still works. Even more,
I couldn't find any documentation what it is or where to get it. So, I
don't think the users should be notified if it is missing. If you browse
the net, you see the message is present is in quite some logs. Better
remove it.
