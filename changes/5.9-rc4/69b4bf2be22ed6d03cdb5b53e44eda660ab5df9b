cb710/core.c: use generic power management

Drivers should not use legacy power management as they have to manage power
states and related operations, for the device, themselves. This driver was
handling them with the help of PCI helper functions like
pci_save/restore_state(), pci_enable/disable_device(), etc.

With generic PM, all essentials will be handled by the PCI core. Driver
needs to do only device-specific operations.

Compile-tested only.
