xfs: fix boundary test in xfs_attr_shortform_verify

The boundary test for the fixed-offset parts of xfs_attr_sf_entry in
xfs_attr_shortform_verify is off by one, because the variable array
at the end is defined as nameval[1] not nameval[].
Hence we need to subtract 1 from the calculation.

This can be shown by:

# touch file
# setfattr -n root.a file

and verifications will fail when it's written to disk.

This only matters for a last attribute which has a single-byte name
and no value, otherwise the combination of namelen & valuelen will
push endp further out and this test won't fail.
