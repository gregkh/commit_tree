ALSA: hda - Fix silent audio output and corrupted input on MSI X570-A PRO

Following Christian Lachner's patch for Gigabyte X570-based motherboards,
also patch the MSI X570-A PRO motherboard; the ALC1220 codec requires the
same workaround for Clevo laptops to enforce the DAC/mixer connection
path. Set up a quirk entry for that.

I suspect most if all X570 motherboards will require similar patches.
