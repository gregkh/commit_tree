arm64/vdso: use the fault callback to map vvar pages

Currently the vdso has no awareness of time namespaces, which may
apply distinct offsets to processes in different namespaces. To handle
this within the vdso, we'll need to expose a per-namespace data page.

As a preparatory step, this patch separates the vdso data page from
the code pages, and has it faulted in via its own fault callback.
Subsquent patches will extend this to support distinct pages per time
namespace.

The vvar vma has to be installed with the VM_PFNMAP flag to handle
faults via its vma fault callback.
