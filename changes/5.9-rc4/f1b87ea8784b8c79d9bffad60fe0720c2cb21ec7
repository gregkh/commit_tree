KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Move kvmppc_svm_page_out up

kvmppc_svm_page_out() will need to be called by kvmppc_uvmem_drop_pages()
so move it up earlier in this file.

Furthermore it will be interesting to call this function when already
holding the kvm->arch.uvmem_lock, so prefix the original function with __
and remove the locking in it, and introduce a wrapper which call that
function with the lock held.

There is no functional change.
