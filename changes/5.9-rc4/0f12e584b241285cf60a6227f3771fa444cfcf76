bpf: Add BTF_ID_LIST_GLOBAL in btf_ids.h

Existing BTF_ID_LIST used a local static variable
to store btf_ids. This patch provided a new macro
BTF_ID_LIST_GLOBAL to store btf_ids in a global
variable which can be shared among multiple files.

The existing BTF_ID_LIST is still retained.
Two reasons. First, BTF_ID_LIST is also used to build
btf_ids for helper arguments which typically
is an array of 5. Since typically different
helpers have different signature, it makes
little sense to share them. Second, some
current computed btf_ids are indeed local.
If later those btf_ids are shared between
different files, they can use BTF_ID_LIST_GLOBAL then.
