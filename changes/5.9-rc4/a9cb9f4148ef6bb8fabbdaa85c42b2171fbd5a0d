dm: don't call report zones for more than the user requested

Don't call report zones for more zones than the user actually requested,
otherwise this can lead to out-of-bounds accesses in the callback
functions.

Such a situation can happen if the target's ->report_zones() callback
function returns 0 because we've reached the end of the target and then
restart the report zones on the second target.

We're again calling into ->report_zones() and ultimately into the user
supplied callback function but when we're not subtracting the number of
zones already processed this may lead to out-of-bounds accesses in the
user callbacks.
