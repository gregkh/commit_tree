gpiolib: cdev: refactor gpiohandle_flags_to_desc_flags

Refactor the mapping from handle flags to desc flags into a helper
function.

The assign_bit is overkill where it is replacing the set_bit cases, as is
rechecking bits known to be clear in some circumstances, but the DRY
simplification more than makes up for any performance degradation,
especially as this is not a hot path.
