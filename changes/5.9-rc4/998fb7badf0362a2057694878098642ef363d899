bus/fsl-mc: Refactor the MSI domain creation in the DPRC driver

The DPRC driver is not taking into account the msi-map property
and assumes that the icid is the same as the stream ID. Although
this assumption is correct, generalize the code to include a
translation between icid and streamID.

Furthermore do not just copy the MSI domain from parent (for child
containers), but use the information provided by the msi-map property.

If the msi-map property is missing from the device tree retain the old
behaviour for backward compatibility ie the child DPRC objects
inherit the MSI domain from the parent.
