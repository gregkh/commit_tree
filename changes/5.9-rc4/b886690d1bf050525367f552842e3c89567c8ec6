lib/vsprintf: Replace hidden BUILD_BUG_ON() with static_assert()

First of all, there is no compile time check for the SMALL
to be ' ' (0x20, i.e. space). Second, for ZEROPAD the check
is hidden in the code.

For better maintenance replace BUILD_BUG_ON() with static_assert()
for ZEROPAD and move it closer to the definition. While at it,
introduce check for SMALL.
