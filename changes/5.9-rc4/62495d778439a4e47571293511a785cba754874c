remoteproc: qcom: Add notification types to SSR

The SSR subdevice only adds callback for the unprepare event. Add callbacks
for prepare, start and prepare events. The client driver for a particular
remoteproc might be interested in knowing the status of the remoteproc
while undergoing SSR, not just when the remoteproc has finished shutting
down.
