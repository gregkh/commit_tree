net/smc: fix toleration of fake add_link messages

Older SMCR implementations had no link failover support and used one
link only. Because the handshake protocol requires to try the
establishment of a second link the old code sent a fake add_link message
and declined any server response afterwards.
The current code supports multiple links and inspects the received fake
add_link message more closely. To tolerate the fake add_link messages
smc_llc_is_local_add_link() needs an improved check of the message to
be able to separate between locally enqueued and fake add_link messages.
And smc_llc_cli_add_link() needs to check if the provided qp_mtu size is
invalid and reject the add_link request in that case.
