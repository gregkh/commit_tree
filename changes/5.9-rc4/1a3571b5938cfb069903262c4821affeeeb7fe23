ice: restore PHY settings on media insertion

After the transition from no media to media FW will clear the
set-phy-cfg data set by the user. Save initial PHY settings and any
settings later requested by the user and use that data to restore PHY
settings on media insertion. Since PHY configuration is now being stored,
replace calls that were calling FW to get the configuration with the saved
copy.
