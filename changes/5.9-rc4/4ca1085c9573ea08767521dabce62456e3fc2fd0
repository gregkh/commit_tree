kthread: remove incorrect comment in kthread_create_on_cpu()

Originally kthread_create_on_cpu() parked and woke up the new thread.
However, since commit a65d40961dc7 ("kthread/smpboot: do not park in
kthread_create_on_cpu()") this is no longer the case.  This patch removes
the comment that has been left behind and is now incorrect / stale.

Fixes: a65d40961dc7 ("kthread/smpboot: do not park in kthread_create_on_cpu()")
