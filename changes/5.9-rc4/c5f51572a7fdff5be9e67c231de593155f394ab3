ftrace: Do not let direct or IPMODIFY ftrace_ops be added to module and set trampolines

When inserting a module, we find all ftrace_ops referencing it on the
ftrace_ops_list. But FTRACE_OPS_FL_DIRECT and FTRACE_OPS_FL_IPMODIFY
flags are special, and should not be set automatically. So warn and
skip ftrace_ops that have these two flags set and adding new code.
Also check if only one ftrace_ops references the module, in which case
we can use a trampoline as an optimization.
