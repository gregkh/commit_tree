platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Register PD CTRL cmd v2

Recognize EC_CMD_USB_PD_CONTROL command version 2. This is necessary in
order to process Type C mux information (like DP alt mode pin
configuration), which is needed by the Type C Connector class API to
configure the Type C muxes correctly

While we are here, rename the struct member storing this version number
from cmd_ver to pd_ctrl_ver, which more accurately reflects what is
being stored.

Also, slightly change the logic for calling
cros_typec_set_port_params_*(). Now, v0 is called when pd_ctrl_ver is 0,
and v1 is called otherwise.
