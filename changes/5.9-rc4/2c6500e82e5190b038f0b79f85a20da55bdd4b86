net: ethernet: ti: cpsw_new: fix clean up of vlan mc entries for host port

To flush the vid + mc entries from ALE, which is required when a VLAN
interface is removed, driver needs to call cpsw_ale_flush_multicast()
with ALE_PORT_HOST for port mask as these entries are added only for
host port. Without this, these entries remain in the ALE table even
after removing the VLAN interface. cpsw_ale_flush_multicast() calls
cpsw_ale_flush_mcast which expects a port mask to do the job.
