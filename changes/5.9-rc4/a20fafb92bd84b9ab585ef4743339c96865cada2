net: dsa: rtl8366rb: Support the CPU DSA tag

This activates the support to use the CPU tag to properly
direct ingress traffic to the right port.

Bit 15 in register RTL8368RB_CPU_CTRL_REG can be set to
1 to disable the insertion of the CPU tag which is what
the code currently does. The bit 15 define calls this
setting RTL8368RB_CPU_INSTAG which is confusing since the
inverse meaning is implied: programmers may think that
setting this bit to 1 will *enable* inserting the tag
rather than disabling it, so rename this setting in
bit 15 to RTL8368RB_CPU_NO_TAG which is more to the
point.

After this e.g. ping works out-of-the-box with the
RTL8366RB.
