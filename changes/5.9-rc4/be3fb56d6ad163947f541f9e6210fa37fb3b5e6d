net: dsa: sja1105: remove empty structures from config table ops

Sparse is complaining and giving the following warning message:
'Using plain integer as NULL pointer'.

This is not what's going on, instead {0} is used as a zero initializer
for the structure members, to indicate that the particular chip revision
does not support those particular config tables.

But since the config tables are declared globally, the unpopulated
elements are zero-initialized anyway. So, to make sparse shut up, let's
remove the zero initializers.
