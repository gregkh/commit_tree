ALSA: hda: Fix 2 channel swapping for Tegra

The Tegra HDA codec HW implementation has an issue related to not
swapping the 2 channel Audio Sample Packet(ASP) channel mapping.
Whatever the FL and FR mapping specified the left channel always
comes out of left speaker and right channel on right speaker. So
add condition to disallow the swapping of FL,FR during the playback.
