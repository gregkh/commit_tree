tools headers: Adopt verbatim copy of btf_ids.h from kernel sources

It will be needed by bpf selftest for resolve_btfids tool.

Also adding __PASTE macro as btf_ids.h dependency, which is
defined in:

  include/linux/compiler_types.h

but because tools/include do not have this header, I'm putting
the macro into linux/compiler.h header.
