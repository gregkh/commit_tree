atm: eni: avoid accessing the data mapped to streaming DMA

In do_tx(), skb->data is mapped to streaming DMA on line 1111:
  paddr = dma_map_single(...,skb->data,DMA_TO_DEVICE);

Then skb->data is accessed on line 1153:
  (skb->data[3] & 0xf)

This access may cause data inconsistency between CPU cache and hardware.

To fix this problem, skb->data[3] is assigned to a local variable before
DMA mapping, and then the driver accesses this local variable instead of
skb->data[3].
