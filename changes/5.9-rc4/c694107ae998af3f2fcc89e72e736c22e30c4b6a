media: mach-imx: mach-imx27_visstrim_m10.c: remove soc_camera dependencies

The soc_camera.h header driver is about to be removed, so drop camera
support from this board. Note that the soc_camera driver itself has
long since been deprecated and can't be compiled anymore (it depends
on BROKEN), so camera support on this board has been broken for a long
time (at least since 4.6 when the mx2_camera.c was removed from soc_camera).
