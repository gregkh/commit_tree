coredump: add %f for executable filename

The document reads "%e" should be "executable filename" while actually it
could be changed by things like pr_ctl PR_SET_NAME.  People who uses "%e"
in core_pattern get surprised when they find out they get thread name
instead of executable filename.

This is either a bug of document or a bug of code.  Since the behavior of
"%e" is there for long time, it could bring another surprise for users if
we "fix" the code.

So we just "fix" the document.  And more, for users who really need the
"executable filename" in core_pattern, we introduce a new "%f" for the
real executable filename.  We already have "%E" for executable path in
kernel, so just reuse most of its code for the new added "%f" format.
