selftests/bpf: Test_progs indicate to shell on non-actions

When a user selects a non-existing test the summary is printed with
indication 0 for all info types, and shell "success" (EXIT_SUCCESS) is
indicated. This can be understood by a human end-user, but for shell
scripting is it useful to indicate a shell failure (EXIT_FAILURE).
