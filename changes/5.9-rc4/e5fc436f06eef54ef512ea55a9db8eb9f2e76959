sparse: use static inline for __chk_{user,io}_ptr()

__chk_user_ptr() & __chk_io_ptr() are dummy extern functions which
only exist to enforce the typechecking of __user or __iomem pointers
in macros when using sparse.

This typechecking is done by inserting a call to these functions.
But the presence of these calls can inhibit some simplifications
and so influence the result of sparse's analysis of context/locking.

Fix this by changing these calls into static inline calls with
an empty body.
