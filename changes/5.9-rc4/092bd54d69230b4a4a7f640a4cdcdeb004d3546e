bcache: add sysfs file to display feature sets information of cache set

The following three sysfs files are created to display according feature
set information of bcache:
	/sys/fs/bcache/<cache set UUID>/internal/feature_compat
	/sys/fs/bcache/<cache set UUID>/internal/feature_ro_compat
	/sys/fs/bcache/<cache set UUID>/internal/feature_incompat
is added by this patch, to display feature sets information of the cache
set.

Now only an incompat feature 'large_bucket' added in bcache, the sysfs
file content is:
        [large_bucket]
string large_bucket means the running bcache drive supports incompat
feature 'large_bucket', the wrapping [] means the 'large_bucket' feature
is currently enabled on this cache set.

This patch is ready to display compat and ro_compat features, in future
once bcache code implements such feature sets, the according feature
strings will be displayed in their sysfs files too.
