misc: rtsx: Remove rtsx_pci_read/write_config() wrappers

rtsx_pci_read_config_dword() and similar wrappers around the PCI config
accessors add very little value, and they obscure the fact that often we
are accessing standard PCI registers that should be coordinated with the
PCI core.

Remove the wrappers and use the PCI config accessors directly.  No
functional change intended.
