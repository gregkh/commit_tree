usb: mtu3: mtu3_trace: Supply missing mtu3_debug.h include file

If the header file containing a function's prototype isn't included by
the sourcefile containing the associated function, the build system
complains of missing prototypes.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/usb/mtu3/mtu3_trace.c:13:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘mtu3_dbg_trace’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
 13 | void mtu3_dbg_trace(struct device *dev, const char *fmt, ...)
 | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
