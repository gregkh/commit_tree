block: Fix page_is_mergeable() for compound pages

If we pass in an offset which is larger than PAGE_SIZE, then
page_is_mergeable() thinks it's not mergeable with the previous bio_vec,
leading to a large number of bio_vecs being used.  Use a slightly more
obvious test that the two pages are compatible with each other.

Fixes: 52d52d1c98a9 ("block: only allow contiguous page structs in a bio_vec")
