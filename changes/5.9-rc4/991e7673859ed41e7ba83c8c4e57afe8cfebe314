mm: memcontrol: account kernel stack per node

Currently the kernel stack is being accounted per-zone.  There is no need
to do that.  In addition due to being per-zone, memcg has to keep a
separate MEMCG_KERNEL_STACK_KB.  Make the stat per-node and deprecate
MEMCG_KERNEL_STACK_KB as memcg_stat_item is an extension of
node_stat_item.  In addition localize the kernel stack stats updates to
account_kernel_stack().
