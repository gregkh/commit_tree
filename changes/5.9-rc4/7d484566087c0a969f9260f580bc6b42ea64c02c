arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add missing properties for Wifi node

The wlan firmware memory is statically mapped in
the Trusted Firmware, hence the wlan driver does
not need to map/unmap this region dynamically.

Hence add the property to indicate the wlan driver
to not map/unamp the firmware memory region
dynamically.

Also add the chain1 voltage supply for wlan.
