tools/bpftool: Move map/prog parsing logic into common

Move functions that parse map and prog by id/tag/name/etc outside of
map.c/prog.c, respectively. These functions are used outside of those files
and are generic enough to be in common. This also makes heavy-weight map.c and
prog.c more decoupled from the rest of bpftool files and facilitates more
lightweight bootstrap bpftool variant.
