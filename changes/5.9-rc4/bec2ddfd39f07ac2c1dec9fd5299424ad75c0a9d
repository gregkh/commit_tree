media: ti-vpe: cal: Fix compilation on 32-bit ARM

When compiled on 32-bit ARM, the CAL driver fails with the FIELD_PREP()
macro complaining that the mask is not constant. While all callers of
the inline cal_write_field() function pass a constant mask, the mask
parameter itself is a variable, which likely doesn't please the
compiler.

Fix it by replacing FIELD_PREP() with a manual implementation.
