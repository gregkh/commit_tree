dmaengine: dw: Take HC_LLP flag into account for noLLP auto-config

Full multi-block transfers functionality is enabled in DW DMA
controller only if CHx_MULTI_BLK_EN is set. But LLP-based transfers
can be executed only if hardcode channel x LLP register feature isn't
enabled, which can be switched on at the IP core synthesis for
optimization. If it's enabled then the LLP register is hardcoded to
zero, so the blocks chaining based on the LLPs is unsupported.
