ceph: handle zero-length feature mask in session messages

Most session messages contain a feature mask, but the MDS will
routinely send a REJECT message with one that is zero-length.

Commit 0fa8263367db ("ceph: fix endianness bug when handling MDS
session feature bits") fixed the decoding of the feature mask,
but failed to account for the MDS sending a zero-length feature
mask. This causes REJECT message decoding to fail.

Skip trying to decode a feature mask if the word count is zero.
