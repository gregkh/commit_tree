selftests/livepatch: adopt to newer sysctl error format

With procfs v3.3.16, the sysctl command doesn't print the set key and
value on error.  This change breaks livepatch selftest test-ftrace.sh,
that tests the interaction of sysctl ftrace_enabled:

Make it work with all sysctl versions using '-q' option.

Explicitly print the final status on success so that it can be verified
in the log. The error message is enough on failure.
