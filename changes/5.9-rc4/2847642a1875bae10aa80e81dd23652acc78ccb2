drm/amd/display: vbios data table packing

[WHY]
Currently we're copying the entire bios image into vbios.  Loading time
for FW with entire bios(54272 bytes) is 105138us.  By copying only the
sections of bios we're using(4436 bytes), loading time drops to 104326us
which saves us 812us.

[HOW]
ROM header, master data table, and all data tables will be packed in
contiguous manner. The offsets for the data tables are remapped to their
newly packed location.
