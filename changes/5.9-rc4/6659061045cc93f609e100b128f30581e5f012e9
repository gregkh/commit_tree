fs: Move __scm_install_fd() to __receive_fd()

In preparation for users of the "install a received file" logic outside
of net/ (pidfd and seccomp), relocate and rename __scm_install_fd() from
net/core/scm.c to __receive_fd() in fs/file.c, and provide a wrapper
named receive_fd_user(), as future patches will change the interface
to __receive_fd().

Additionally add a comment to fd_install() as a counterpoint to how
__receive_fd() interacts with fput().
