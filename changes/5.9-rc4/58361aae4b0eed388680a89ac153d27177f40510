habanalabs: set max power according to card type

In Gaudi, the default max power setting is different between PCI and PMC
cards. Therefore, the driver need to set the default after knowing what is
the card type.

The current code has a bug where it limits the maximum power of the PMC
card to 200W after a reset occurs.
