ASoC: atmel-pdmic: remove codec component

The CPU and the codec both are represented now as components, so for
PDMIC we are registering two componenets with the same name. Since
there is no actual codec, we will merge the codec component into the
CPU one and use a dummy codec instead, for the DAI link.
As a bonus, debugfs will no longer report an error when will try to
create entries for both componenets with the same name.
