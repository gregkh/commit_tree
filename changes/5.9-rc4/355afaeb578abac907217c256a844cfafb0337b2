io_uring: no read/write-retry on -EAGAIN error and O_NONBLOCK marked file

Actually two things that need fixing up here:

- The io_rw_reissue() -EAGAIN retry is explicit to block devices and
  regular files, so don't ever attempt to do that on other types of
  files.

- If we hit -EAGAIN on a nonblock marked file, don't arm poll handler for
  it. It should just complete with -EAGAIN.
