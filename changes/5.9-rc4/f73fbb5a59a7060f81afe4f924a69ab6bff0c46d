drm/i915/selftests: Check for an initial-breadcrumb in wait_for_submit()

When we look at i915_request_is_started() we must be careful in case we
are using a request that does not have the initial-breadcrumb and
instead the is-started is being compared against the end of the previous
request. This will make wait_for_submit() declare that a request has
been already submitted too early.
