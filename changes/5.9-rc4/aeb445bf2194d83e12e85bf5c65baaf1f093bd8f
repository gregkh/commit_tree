m68k: mac: Don't send IOP message until channel is idle

In the following sequence of calls, iop_do_send() gets called when the
"send" channel is not in the IOP_MSG_IDLE state:

	iop_ism_irq()
		iop_handle_send()
			(msg->handler)()
				iop_send_message()
			iop_do_send()

Avoid this by testing the channel state before calling iop_do_send().

When sending, and iop_send_queue is empty, call iop_do_send() because
the channel is idle. If iop_send_queue is not empty, iop_do_send() will
get called later by iop_handle_send().
