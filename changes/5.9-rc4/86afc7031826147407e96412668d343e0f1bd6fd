tunnel6: add tunnel6_input_afinfo for ipip and ipv6 tunnels

This patch is to register a callback function tunnel6_rcv_cb with
is_ipip set in a xfrm_input_afinfo object for tunnel6 and tunnel46.

It will be called by xfrm_rcv_cb() from xfrm_input() when family
is AF_INET6 and proto is IPPROTO_IPIP or IPPROTO_IPV6.

v1->v2:
  - Fix a sparse warning caused by the missing "__rcu", as Jakub
    noticed.
  - Handle the err returned by xfrm_input_register_afinfo() in
    tunnel6_init/fini(), as Sabrina noticed.
v2->v3:
  - Add "#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_INET6_XFRM_TUNNEL)" to fix the build error
    when xfrm is disabled, reported by kbuild test robot
