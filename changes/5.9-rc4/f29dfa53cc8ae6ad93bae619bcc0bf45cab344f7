x86/bugs/multihit: Fix mitigation reporting when VMX is not in use

On systems that have virtualization disabled or unsupported, sysfs
mitigation for X86_BUG_ITLB_MULTIHIT is reported incorrectly as:

  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
  KVM: Vulnerable

System is not vulnerable to DoS attack from a rogue guest when
virtualization is disabled or unsupported in the hardware. Change the
mitigation reporting for these cases.
