vdpa/mlx5: Add VDPA driver for supported mlx5 devices

Add a front end VDPA driver that registers in the VDPA bus and provides
networking to a guest. The VDPA driver creates the necessary resources
on the VF it is driving such that data path will be offloaded.

Notifications are being communicated through the driver.

Currently, only VFs are supported. In subsequent patches we will have
devlink support to control which VF is used for VDPA and which function
is used for regular networking.
