libata: implement ATA_HORKAGE_MAX_TRIM_128M and apply to Sandisks

All three generations of Sandisk SSDs lock up hard intermittently.
Experiments showed that disabling NCQ lowered the failure rate significantly
and the kernel has been disabling NCQ for some models of SD7's and 8's,
which is obviously undesirable.

Karthik worked with Sandisk to root cause the hard lockups to trim commands
larger than 128M. This patch implements ATA_HORKAGE_MAX_TRIM_128M which
limits max trim size to 128M and applies it to all three generations of
Sandisk SSDs.
