tools/bpftool: Minimize bootstrap bpftool

Build minimal "bootstrap mode" bpftool to enable skeleton (and, later,
vmlinux.h generation), instead of building almost complete, but slightly
different (w/o skeletons, etc) bpftool to bootstrap complete bpftool build.

Current approach doesn't scale well (engineering-wise) when adding more BPF
programs to bpftool and other complicated functionality, as it requires
constant adjusting of the code to work in both bootstrapped mode and normal
mode.

So it's better to build only minimal bpftool version that supports only BPF
skeleton code generation and BTF-to-C conversion. Thankfully, this is quite
easy to accomplish due to internal modularity of bpftool commands. This will
also allow to keep adding new functionality to bpftool in general, without the
need to care about bootstrap mode for those new parts of bpftool.
