x86/ftrace: Make non direct case the default in ftrace_regs_caller

If a direct function is hooked along with one of the ftrace registered
functions, then the ftrace_regs_caller is attached to the function that
shares the direct hook as well as the ftrace hook. The ftrace_regs_caller
will call ftrace_ops_list_func() that iterates through all the registered
ftrace callbacks, and if there's a direct callback attached to that
function, the direct ftrace_ops callback is called to notify that
ftrace_regs_caller to return to the direct caller instead of going back to
the function that called it.

But this is a very uncommon case. Currently, the code has it as the default
case. Modify ftrace_regs_caller to make the default case (the non jump) to
just return normally, and have the jump to the handling of the direct
caller.
