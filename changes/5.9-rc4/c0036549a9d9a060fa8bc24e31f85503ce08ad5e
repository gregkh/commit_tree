powerpc/security: split branch cache flush toggle from code patching

Branch cache flushing code patching has inter-dependencies on both the
link stack and the count cache flushing state.

To make the code clearer and to separate the link stack and count
cache handling, split the "toggle" (setting up variables and printing
enable/disable) from the code patching.
