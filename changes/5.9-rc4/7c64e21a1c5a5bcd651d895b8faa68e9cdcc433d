powerpc/kexec_file: Restrict memory usage of kdump kernel

Kdump kernel, used for capturing the kernel core image, is supposed
to use only specific memory regions to avoid corrupting the image to
be captured. The regions are crashkernel range - the memory reserved
explicitly for kdump kernel, memory used for the tce-table, the OPAL
region and RTAS region as applicable. Restrict kdump kernel memory
to use only these regions by setting up usable-memory DT property.
Also, tell the kdump kernel to run at the loaded address by setting
the magic word at 0x5c.
