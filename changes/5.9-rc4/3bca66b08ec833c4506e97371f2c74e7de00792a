clk: vc5: use a dedicated struct to describe the output drivers

Reusing the generic struct vc5_hw_data for all blocks is handy. However it
implies we allocate space the div_int and div_frc fields even for the
output drivers where they are unused, and the clk_output_cfg0 and
clk_output_cfg0_mask fields for all components even though they are used
only for the output drivers.

Use a dedicated struct for the output drivers so that each block uses
exactly the fields it needs, not more.
