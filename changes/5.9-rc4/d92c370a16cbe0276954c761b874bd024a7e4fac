block: really clone the block cgroup in bio_clone_blkg_association

bio_clone_blkg_association is supposed to clone the associatation, but
actually ends up doing a search with a tryget.  As we know we have a
reference on the source cgroup just get an unconditional additional
reference to it and call it a day.  That also removes the need for
a RCU critical section.
