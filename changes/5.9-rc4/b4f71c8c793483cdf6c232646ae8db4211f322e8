drm/amd/display: Make new dc interface for adding dsc resource

[Why]
dcn20_add_dsc_to_stream_resource is accessed in amdgpu_dm directly.
This creates build error for configuration with DCN disabled.

[How]
Make the function available through a resource pool function so
that dcn20 function need not be called directly.
