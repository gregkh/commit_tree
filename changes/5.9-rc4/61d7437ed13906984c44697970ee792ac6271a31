mmc: sdhci-acpi: Fix HS400 tuning for AMDI0040

The AMD eMMC Controller can only use the tuned clock while in HS200 and
HS400 mode. If we switch to a different mode, we need to disable the
tuned clock. If we have previously performed tuning and switch back to
HS200 or HS400, we can re-enable the tuned clock.

Previously the tuned clock was not getting disabled when switching to
DDR52 which is part of the HS400 tuning sequence.
