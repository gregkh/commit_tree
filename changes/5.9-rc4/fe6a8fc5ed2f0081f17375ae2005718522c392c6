loop: unset GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN on LOOP_CONFIGURE

When LOOP_CONFIGURE is used with LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN we need to propagate
this into the GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN. LOOP_SETSTATUS does this,
LOOP_CONFIGURE doesn't so far. Effect is that setting up a loopback
device with partition scanning doesn't actually work when LOOP_CONFIGURE
is issued, though it works fine with LOOP_SETSTATUS.

Let's correct that and propagate the flag in LOOP_CONFIGURE too.
