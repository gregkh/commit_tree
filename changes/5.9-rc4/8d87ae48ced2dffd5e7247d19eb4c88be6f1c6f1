PM: domains: Fix up terminology with parent/child

The genpd infrastructure uses the terms master/slave, but such uses have
no external exposures (not even in Documentation/driver-api/pm/*) and are
not mandated by nor associated with any external specifications. Change
the language used through-out to parent/child.

There was one possible exception in the debugfs node
"pm_genpd/pm_genpd_summary" but its path has no hits outside of the
kernel itself when performing a code search[1], and it seems even this
single usage has been non-functional since it was introduced due to a
typo in the Python ("apend" instead of correct "append"). Fix the typo
while we're at it.
