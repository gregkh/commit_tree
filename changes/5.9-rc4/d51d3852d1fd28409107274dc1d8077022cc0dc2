docs: watchdog: codify ident.options as superset of possible status flags

The FIXME comment has been in-tree since the very first git commit.
The described behavior has been since relied on by some userspace, e.g.
the util-linux wdctl command and has been ignored by some kernelspace,
like the f71808e_wdt driver.

The functionality is useful to have to be able to differentiate between a
driver that doesn't support WDIOF_CARDRESET and one that does, but hasn't
had a watchdog reset, thus drop the FIXME to encourage drivers adopting
this convention.
