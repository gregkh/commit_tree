perf tools: Correct SNOOPX field offset

perf_event.h has macros that define the field offsets in the data_src
bitmask in perf records. The SNOOPX and REMOTE offsets were both 37.

These are distinct fields, and the bitfield layout in perf_mem_data_src
confirms that SNOOPX should be at offset 38.

Committer notes:

This was extracted from a larger patch that also contained kernel
changes.
