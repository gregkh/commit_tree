random32: add a tracepoint for prandom_u32()

There has been some heat around prandom_u32() lately, and some people
were wondering if there was a simple way to determine how often
it was used, before considering making it maybe 10 times more expensive.

This tracepoint exports the generated pseudo random value.

Tested:

perf list | grep prandom_u32
  random:prandom_u32                                 [Tracepoint event]

perf record -a [-g] [-C1] -e random:prandom_u32 sleep 1
[ perf record: Woken up 0 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 259.748 MB perf.data (924087 samples) ]
