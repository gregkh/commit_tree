powerpc: switch to ->regset_get()

Note: compat variant of REGSET_TM_CGPR is almost certainly wrong;
it claims to be 48*64bit, but just as compat REGSET_GPR it stores
44*32bit of (truncated) registers + 4 32bit zeros... followed by
48 more 32bit zeroes.  Might be too late to change - it's a userland
ABI, after all ;-/
