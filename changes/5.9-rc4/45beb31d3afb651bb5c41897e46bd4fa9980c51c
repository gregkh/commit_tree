PCI: Mark AMD Navi10 GPU rev 0x00 ATS as broken

We are seeing AMD Radeon Pro W5700 doesn't work when IOMMU is enabled:

  iommu ivhd0: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IOTLB_INV_TIMEOUT device=63:00.0 address=0x42b5b01a0]
  iommu ivhd0: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IOTLB_INV_TIMEOUT device=63:00.0 address=0x42b5b01c0]

The error also makes graphics driver fail to probe the device.

It appears to be the same issue as commit 5e89cd303e3a ("PCI: Mark AMD
Navi14 GPU rev 0xc5 ATS as broken") addresses, and indeed the same ATS
quirk can workaround the issue.
