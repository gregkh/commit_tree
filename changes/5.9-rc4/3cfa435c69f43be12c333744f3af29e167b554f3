crypto: ux500/hash - Add namespacing to hash_init()

A recent change to the Regulator consumer API (which this driver
utilises) add prototypes for the some suspend functions.  These
functions require including header file include/linux/suspend.h.

The following tree of includes affecting this driver will be
present:

   In file included from include/linux/elevator.h:6,
                    from include/linux/blkdev.h:288,
                    from include/linux/blk-cgroup.h:23,
                    from include/linux/writeback.h:14,
                    from include/linux/memcontrol.h:22,
                    from include/linux/swap.h:9,
                    from include/linux/suspend.h:5,
                    from include/linux/regulator/consumer.h:35,
                    from drivers/crypto/ux500/hash/hash_core.c:28:

include/linux/elevator.h pulls in include/linux/hashtable.h which
contains its own version of hash_init().  This confuses the build
system and results in the following error (amongst others):

 drivers/crypto/ux500/hash/hash_core.c:1362:19: error: passing argument 1 of '__hash_init' from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
 1362 |  return hash_init(req);

Fix this by namespacing the local hash_init() such that the
source of confusion is removed.
