cail,hsi: fix cfhsi_xmit()'s return type

The method ndo_start_xmit() is defined as returning an 'netdev_tx_t',
which is a typedef for an enum type, but the implementation in this
driver returns an 'int'.

Fix this by returning 'netdev_tx_t' in this driver too and
returning NETDEV_TX_OK instead of 0 accordingly.
