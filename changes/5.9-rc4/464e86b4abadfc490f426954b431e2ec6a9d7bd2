lkdtm: Avoid more compiler optimizations for bad writes

It seems at least Clang is able to throw away writes it knows are
destined for read-only memory, which makes things like the WRITE_RO test
fail, as the write gets elided. Instead, force the variable to be
volatile, and make similar changes through-out other tests in an effort
to avoid needing to repeat fixing these kinds of problems. Also includes
pr_err() calls in failure paths so that kernel logs are more clear in
the failure case.
