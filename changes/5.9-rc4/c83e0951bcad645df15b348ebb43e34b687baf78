arm64: dts: qcom: msm8992: Fix SDHCI1

This commit ensures the correct IRQ type is set
and disables the device by default.
The mmc-hs400-1_8v property is also moved to
Bullhead as it might not be present on all boards.

The node has been renamed to sdhci@ instead of mmc@
and the phandle was changed to sdhc_1 to comply with
the newer DTS style.
