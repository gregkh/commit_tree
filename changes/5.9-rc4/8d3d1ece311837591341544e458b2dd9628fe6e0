ALSA: hda/realtek: Use the new vmaster mute LED helper

Convert the mute LED handling in Realtek codec to the new vmaster mute
helper.  A point to be cautiously handled is that the value passed to
the callback is inverted; the vmaster passes "enabled" (0 = mute),
while LED classdev passes "brightness" (1 = mute).

The code in Thinkpad helper is also converted.   In that case, just
call the new function and remove the open-code.
