hantro: h264: Rename scaling list handling function

Commit e17f08e31666 ("media: hantro: Do not reorder
H264 scaling list") removed the scaling list reordering,
which was wrong and not needed.

However, the name of the function stayed, which is
confusing for anyone reading the code. Rename
from "reorder" to "assemble" which is cleaner.

This is just a cosmetic cleanup.
