pinctrl: sh-pfc: pfc-r8a77951: Add R8A774E1 PFC support

Renesas RZ/G2H (r8a774e1) is pin compatible with R-Car H3 (R8A77951),
however it doesn't have several automotive specific peripherals. Add
automotive-specific pin groups/functions along with common pin
groups/functions for supporting both r8a77951 and r8a774e1 SoC.
