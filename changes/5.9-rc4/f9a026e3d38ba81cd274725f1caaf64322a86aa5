KVM: arm64: Lift instrumentation restrictions on VHE

With VHE and nVHE executable code completely separated, remove build config
that disabled GCOV/KASAN/UBSAN/KCOV instrumentation for VHE as these now
execute under the same memory mappings as the rest of the kernel.

No violations are currently being reported by either KASAN or UBSAN.
