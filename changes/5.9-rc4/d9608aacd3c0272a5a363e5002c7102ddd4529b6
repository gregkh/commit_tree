net: phy: mscc: do not access the MDIO bus lock directly

This patch improves the MSCC driver by using the provided
phy_lock_mdio_bus and phy_unlock_mdio_bus helpers instead of locking and
unlocking the MDIO bus lock directly. The patch is only cosmetic but
should improve maintenance and consistency.
