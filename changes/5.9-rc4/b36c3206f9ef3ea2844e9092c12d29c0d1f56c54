samples: bpf: Add an option for printing extra statistics in xdpsock

Introduce the --extra-stats (or simply -x) flag to the xdpsock application
which prints additional statistics alongside the regular rx and tx
counters. The new statistics printed report error conditions eg. rx ring
full, invalid descriptors, etc.
