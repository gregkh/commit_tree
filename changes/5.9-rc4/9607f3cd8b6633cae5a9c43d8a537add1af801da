usb: dwc2: gadget: Make use of GINTMSK2

The value obtained from GINTSTS2 should be masked with the GINTMSK2
value.  Looks like this has been broken since
dwc2_gadget_wkup_alert_handler() was added back in 2018.

Also fixes the following W=1 warning:

 drivers/usb/dwc2/gadget.c: In function ‘dwc2_gadget_wkup_alert_handler’:
 drivers/usb/dwc2/gadget.c:259:6: warning: variable ‘gintmsk2’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 259 | u32 gintmsk2;
