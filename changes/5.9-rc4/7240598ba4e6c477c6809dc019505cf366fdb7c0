arm64: dts: allwinner: h5: Add CPU Operating Performance Points table

Add an OPP (Operating Performance Points) table for the CPU cores for
boards to include to DVFS (Dynamic Voltage & Frequency Scaling) on the
H5. The table originates from Armbian, but the maximum voltage is raised
slightly to account for boards using slightly higher voltages.

The table and tie in to the CPU cores are put in a separate dtsi file
that board files can include to opt in. Or they can define their own
tables if the standard one does not fit.

This has been tested on the Libre Computer ALL-H3-CC-H5 and the Bananapi
M2+ v1.2 H5, both with adequate cooling. The former has a fixed 1.2V
regulator, while the latter has a GPIO controlled regulator switchable
between 1.1V and 1.3V.
