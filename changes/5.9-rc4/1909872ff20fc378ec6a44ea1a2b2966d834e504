firmware: arm_scmi: Add fast_switch_possible() interface

Add a new fast_switch_possible interface to the existing perf_ops to
export the information of whether or not fast_switch is possible for a
given device.

This can be used by the cpufreq driver and framework to choose proper
mechanism for frequency change.
