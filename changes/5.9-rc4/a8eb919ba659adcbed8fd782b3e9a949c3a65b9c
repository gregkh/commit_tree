net/mlx5e: CT: Restore ct state from lookup in zone instead of tupleid

Remove tupleid, and replace it with zone_restore, which is the zone an
established tuple sets after match. On miss, Use this zone + tuple
taken from the skb, to lookup the ct entry and restore it.

This improves flow insertion rate by avoiding the allocation of a header
rewrite context.
