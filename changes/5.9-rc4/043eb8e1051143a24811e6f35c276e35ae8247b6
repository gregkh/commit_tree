kthread: Switch to cpu_possible_mask

Next patch will switch unbound kernel threads mask to
housekeeping_cpumask(), a subset of cpu_possible_mask. So in order to
ease bisection, lets first switch kthreads default affinity from
cpu_all_mask to cpu_possible_mask.

It looks safe to do so as cpu_possible_mask seem to be initialized
at setup_arch() time, way before kthreadd is created.
