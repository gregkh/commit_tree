ALSA: usb-audio: Disable autosuspend for Lenovo ThinkStation P620

If USB autosuspend is enabled, both front and rear panel can no longer
detect jack insertion.

Enable USB remote wakeup, i.e. needs_remote_wakeup = 1, doesn't help
either.

So disable USB autosuspend to prevent missing jack detection event.
