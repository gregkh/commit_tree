fpga: dfl: parse interrupt info for feature devices on enumeration

DFL based FPGA devices could support interrupts for different purposes,
but current DFL framework only supports feature device enumeration with
given MMIO resources information via common DFL headers. This patch
introduces one new API dfl_fpga_enum_info_add_irq for low level bus
drivers (e.g. PCIe device driver) to pass its interrupt resources
information to DFL framework for enumeration, and also adds interrupt
enumeration code in framework to parse and assign interrupt resources
for enumerated feature devices and their own sub features.

With this patch, DFL framework enumerates interrupt resources for core
features, including PORT Error Reporting, FME (FPGA Management Engine)
Error Reporting and also AFU User Interrupts.
