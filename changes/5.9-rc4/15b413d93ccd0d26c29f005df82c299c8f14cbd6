spi: spi-topcliff-pch: drop call to wakeup-disable

Before generic upgrade, both .suspend() and .resume() were invoking
pci_enable_wake(pci_dev, PCI_D3hot, 0). Hence, disabling wakeup in both
states. (Normal trend is .suspend() enables and .resume() disables the
wakeup.)

This was ambiguous and may be buggy. Instead of replicating the legacy
behavior, drop the wakeup-disable call.
