net: phylink: update PCS when changing interface during resolution

The only PHYs that are used with phylink which change their interface
are the BCM84881 and MV88X3310 family, both of which only change their
interface modes on link-up events.  This will break when drivers are
converted to split-PCS.  Fix this.
