drm/vmwgfx/stdu: Use drm_mode_config_reset

When converting to atomic the state reset was done by directly calling
the functions, and before the modeset object was fully initialized.
This means the various ->dev pointers weren't set up.

    drm/atomic-helper: reset vblank on crtc reset

this started to oops because now we're trying to derefence
drm_crtc->dev. Fix this up by entirely switching over to
drm_mode_config_reset, called once everything is set up.
