net: phylink: simplify phy case for ksettings_set method

When we have a PHY attached, an ethtool ksettings_set() call only
really needs to call through to the phylib equivalent; phylib will
call back to us when the link changes so we can update our state.
Therefore, we can bypass most of our ksettings_set() call for this
case.
