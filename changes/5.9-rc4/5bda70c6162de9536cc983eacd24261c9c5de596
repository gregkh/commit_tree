dt-bindings: arm: fsl: Add msi-map device-tree binding for fsl-mc bus

The existing bindings cannot be used to specify the relationship
between fsl-mc devices and GIC ITSes.
Add a generic binding for mapping fsl-mc devices to GIC ITSes, using
msi-map property.
In addition, deprecate msi-parent property which no longer makes sense
now that we support translating the MSIs.
