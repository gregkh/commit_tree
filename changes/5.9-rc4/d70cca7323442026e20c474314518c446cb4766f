hantro: h264: Refuse to decode unsupported bitstream

The hardware only supports 4:2:0 or 4:0:0 (monochrome),
8-bit depth content.

Verify that the SPS refers to a supported bitstream, and refuse
unsupported bitstreams by failing at TRY_EXT_CTRLS time.

Given the JPEG compression level control is the only one
that needs setting, a specific ops is provided.
