Revert "ALSA: pcm: Use SG-buffer only when direct DMA is available"

This reverts commit 3ad796cbc36a ("ALSA: pcm: Use SG-buffer only when
direct DMA is available") also the modification commit 467fd0e82b62
("ALSA: pcm: Fix build error on m68k and others").

Poking the DMA internal helper is a layer violation, so we should
avoid that.  Meanwhile the actual bug has been addressed by the
Kconfig fix in commit dbed452a078d ("dma-pool: decouple DMA_REMAP from
DMA_COHERENT_POOL"), so we can live without this hack.
