mm/sparse: only sub-section aligned range would be populated

There are two code path which invoke __populate_section_memmap()

  * sparse_init_nid()
  * sparse_add_section()

For both case, we are sure the memory range is sub-section aligned.

  * we pass PAGES_PER_SECTION to sparse_init_nid()
  * we check range by check_pfn_span() before calling
    sparse_add_section()

Also, the counterpart of __populate_section_memmap(), we don't do such
calculation and check since the range is checked by check_pfn_span() in
__remove_pages().

Clear the calculation and check to keep it simple and comply with its
counterpart.
