ARM: dts: omap3: Migrate AES from hwmods to sysc-omap2

Various OMAP3 boards have two AES blocks, but only one is currently
available, because the hwmods are only configured for one.

This patch migrates the hwmods for the AES engine to sysc-omap2
which allows the second AES crypto engine to become available.
