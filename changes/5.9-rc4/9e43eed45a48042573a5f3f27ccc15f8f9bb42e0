staging: rts5208: Use array_size() helper in vmalloc() and memset()

The vmalloc() function has no 2-factor argument form, so multiplication
factors need to be wrapped in array_size(). Also, while there, use
array_size() in memset().

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle and, audited and fixed
manually.
