loop: Set correct device size when using LOOP_CONFIGURE

The device size calculation was done before processing the loop
configuration, which meant that the we set the size on the underlying
block device incorrectly in case lo_offset/lo_sizelimit were set in the
configuration. Delay computing the size until we've setup the device
parameters correctly.
