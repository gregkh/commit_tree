btrfs: set the lockdep class for log tree extent buffers

These are special extent buffers that get rewound in order to lookup
the state of the tree at a specific point in time.  As such they do not
go through the normal initialization paths that set their lockdep class,
so handle them appropriately when they are created and before they are
locked.
