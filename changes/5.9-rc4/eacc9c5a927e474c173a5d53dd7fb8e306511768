cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix intel_pstate_get_hwp_max() for turbo disabled

This fixes the behavior of the scaling_max_freq and scaling_min_freq
sysfs files in systems which had turbo disabled by the BIOS.

Caleb noticed that the HWP is programmed to operate in the wrong
P-state range on his system when the CPUFREQ policy min/max frequency
is set via sysfs.  This seems to be because in his system
intel_pstate_get_hwp_max() is returning the maximum turbo P-state even
though turbo was disabled by the BIOS, which causes intel_pstate to
scale kHz frequencies incorrectly e.g. setting the maximum turbo
frequency whenever the maximum guaranteed frequency is requested via
sysfs.
