entry: Correct __secure_computing() stub

The original version of that used secure_computing() which has no
arguments. Review requested to switch to __secure_computing() which has
one. The function name was correct, but no argument added and of course
compiling without SECCOMP was deemed overrated.

Add the missing function argument.
