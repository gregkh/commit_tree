net: bpf: Add bpf_seq_afinfo in tcp_iter_state

A new field bpf_seq_afinfo is added to tcp_iter_state
to provide bpf tcp iterator afinfo. There are two
reasons on why we did this.

First, the current way to get afinfo from PDE_DATA
does not work for bpf iterator as its seq_file
inode does not conform to /proc/net/{tcp,tcp6}
inode structures. More specifically, anonymous
bpf iterator will use an anonymous inode which
is shared in the system and we cannot change inode
private data structure at all.

Second, bpf iterator for tcp/tcp6 wants to
traverse all tcp and tcp6 sockets in one pass
and bpf program can control whether they want
to skip one sk_family or not. Having a different
afinfo with family AF_UNSPEC make it easier
to understand in the code.

This patch does not change /proc/net/{tcp,tcp6} behavior
as the bpf_seq_afinfo will be NULL for these two proc files.
