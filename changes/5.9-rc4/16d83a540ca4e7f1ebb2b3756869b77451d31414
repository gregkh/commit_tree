Revert "powerpc/powernv/idle: Replace CPU feature check with PVR check"

cpuidle stop state implementation has minor optimizations for P10
where hardware preserves more SPR registers compared to P9. The
current P9 driver works for P10, although does few extra
save-restores. P9 driver can provide the required power management
features like SMT thread folding and core level power savings on a P10
platform.

Until the P10 stop driver is available, revert the commit which allows
for only P9 systems to utilize cpuidle and blocks all idle stop states
for P10. CPU idle states are enabled and tested on the P10 platform
with this fix.

This reverts commit 8747bf36f312356f8a295a0c39ff092d65ce75ae.
