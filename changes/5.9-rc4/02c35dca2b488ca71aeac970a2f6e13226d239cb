arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e: Enable Super-Speed support for USB0

USB0 supports super-speed mode on the EVM. Enable that.
On the EVM, USB0 uses SERDES3 for super-speed lane.

Since USB0 is a type-C port, it needs to support lane swapping
for cable flip support. This is provided using SERDES lane
swap feature. Provide the Type-C cable orientation GPIO
to the SERDES Wrapper driver.
