net: use mptcp setsockopt function for SOL_SOCKET on mptcp sockets

setsockopt(mptcp_fd, SOL_SOCKET, ...)...  appears to work (returns 0),
but it has no effect -- this is because the MPTCP layer never has a
chance to copy the settings to the subflow socket.

Skip the generic handling for the mptcp case and instead call the
mptcp specific handler instead for SOL_SOCKET too.

Next patch adds more specific handling for SOL_SOCKET to mptcp.
