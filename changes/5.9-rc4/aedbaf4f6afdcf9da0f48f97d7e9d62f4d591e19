KVM: x86: Extract kvm_update_cpuid_runtime() from kvm_update_cpuid()

Beside called in kvm_vcpu_ioctl_set_cpuid*(), kvm_update_cpuid() is also
called 5 places else in x86.c and 1 place else in lapic.c. All those 6
places only need the part of updating guest CPUIDs (OSXSAVE, OSPKE, APIC,
KVM_FEATURE_PV_UNHALT, ...) based on the runtime vcpu state, so extract
them as a separate kvm_update_cpuid_runtime().
