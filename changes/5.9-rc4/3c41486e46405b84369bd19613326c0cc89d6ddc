qed: use transceiver data to fill link partner's advertising speeds

Currently qed driver does not take into consideration transceiver's
capabilities when generating link partner's speed advertisement. This
leads to e.g. incorrect ethtool link info on 10GbaseT modules.
Use transceiver info not only for advertisement and support arrays, but
also for link partner's abilities to fix it.

Misc: fix a couple of comments nearby.
