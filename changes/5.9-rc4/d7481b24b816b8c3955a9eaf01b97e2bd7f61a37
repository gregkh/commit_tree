audit: issue CWD record to accompany LSM_AUDIT_DATA_* records

The LSM_AUDIT_DATA_* records for PATH, FILE, IOCTL_OP, DENTRY and INODE
are incomplete without the task context of the AUDIT Current Working
Directory record.  Add it.

This record addition can't use audit_dummy_context to determine whether
or not to store the record information since the LSM_AUDIT_DATA_*
records are initiated by various LSMs independent of any audit rules.
context->in_syscall is used to determine if it was called in user
context like audit_getname.

Please see the upstream issue
https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-kernel/issues/96
