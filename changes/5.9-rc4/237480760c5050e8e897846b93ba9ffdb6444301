nvme-fc: set max_segments to lldd max value

Currently the FC transport is set max_hw_sectors based on the lldds
max sgl segment count. However, the block queue max segments is
set based on the controller's max_segments count, which the transport
does not set.  As such, the lldd is receiving sgl lists that are
exceeding its max segment count.

Set the controller max segment count and derive max_hw_sectors from
the max segment count.
