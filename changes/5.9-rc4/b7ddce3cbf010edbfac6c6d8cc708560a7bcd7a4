io_uring: fix cancel of deferred reqs with ->files

While trying to cancel requests with ->files, it also should look for
requests in ->defer_list, otherwise it might end up hanging a thread.

Cancel all requests in ->defer_list up to the last request there with
matching ->files, that's needed to follow drain ordering semantics.
