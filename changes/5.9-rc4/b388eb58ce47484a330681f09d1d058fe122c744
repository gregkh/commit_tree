cpufreq: intel_pstate: Tweak the EPP sysfs interface

Modify the EPP sysfs interface to reject attempts to change the EPP
to values different from 0 ("performance") in the active mode with
the "performance" policy (ie. scaling_governor set to "performance"),
to avoid situations in which the kernel appears to discard data
passed to it via the EPP sysfs attribute.
