habanalabs: Use pending CS amount per ASIC

Training schemes requires much more concurrent command submissions than
inference does. In addition, training command submissions can be completed
in a non serialized manner. Hence, we add support in which each ASIC will
be able to configure the amount of concurrent pending command submissions,
rather than use a predefined amount. This change will enhance performance
by allowing the user to add more concurrent work without waiting for the
previous work to be completed.
