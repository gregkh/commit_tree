mm: move page-flags include to top of file

Give up on the notion that we can remove page-flags.h from mm.h.  There
are currently 14 inline functions which use a PageFoo function.  Also, two
of the files directly included by mm.h include page-flags.h themselves,
and there are probably more indirect inclusions.  So just include it at
the top like any other header file.
