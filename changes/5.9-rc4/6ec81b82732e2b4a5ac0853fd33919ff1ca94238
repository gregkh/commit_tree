drm/i915/pmu: avoid an maybe-uninitialized warning

Conditional spinlocks make it hard for gcc and for lockdep to
follow the code flow. This one causes a warning with at least
gcc-9 and higher:

In file included from include/linux/irq.h:14,
                 from drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_pmu.c:7:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_pmu.c: In function 'i915_sample':
include/linux/spinlock.h:289:3: error: 'flags' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
  289 |   _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore(lock, flags); \
      |   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_pmu.c:288:17: note: 'flags' was declared here
  288 |   unsigned long flags;
      |                 ^~~~~

Split out the part between the locks into a separate function
for readability and to let the compiler figure out what the
logic actually is.
