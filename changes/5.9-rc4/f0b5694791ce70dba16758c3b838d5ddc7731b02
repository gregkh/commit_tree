PM / EM: change name of em_pd_energy to em_cpu_energy

Energy Model framework now supports other devices than CPUs. Refactor some
of the functions in order to prevent wrong usage. The old function
em_pd_energy has to generic name. It must not be used without proper
cpumask pointer, which is possible only for CPU devices. Thus, rename it
and add proper description to warn of potential wrong usage for other
devices.
