lockdep: Change hardirq{s_enabled,_context} to per-cpu variables

Currently all IRQ-tracking state is in task_struct, this means that
task_struct needs to be defined before we use it.

Especially for lockdep_assert_irq*() this can lead to header-hell.

Move the hardirq state into per-cpu variables to avoid the task_struct
dependency.
