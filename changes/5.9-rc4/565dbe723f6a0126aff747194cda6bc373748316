docs: fs: proc.rst: convert a new chapter to ReST

A new chapter was added to proc.rst. Adjust the markups
to avoid this warning:

	Documentation/filesystems/proc.rst:2194: WARNING: Inconsistent literal block quoting.

And to properly mark the code-blocks there.

Fixes: 37e7647a7212 ("docs: proc: add documentation for "hidepid=4" and "subset=pid" options and new mount behavior")
