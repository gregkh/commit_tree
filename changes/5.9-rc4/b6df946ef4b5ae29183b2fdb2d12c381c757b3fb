drm/amdgpu: fix the nullptr issue as for PWR IP not existing in discovery table

Fixes: c1cf79ca5ced46 ("drm/amdgpu: use IP discovery table for renoir")

This nullptr issue should be specific on the Renoir series during try access the PWR_MISC_CNTL_STATUS
when PWR IP not been detected by discovery table. Moreover the PWR IP not existing in Renoir series is
expected therefore just avoid access PWR register in Renoir series.
