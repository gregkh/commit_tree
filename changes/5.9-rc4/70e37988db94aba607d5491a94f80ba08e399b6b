nvmet-fc: Fix a missed _irqsave version of spin_lock in 'nvmet_fc_fod_op_done()'

The way 'spin_lock()' and 'spin_lock_irqsave()' are used is not consistent
in this function.

Use 'spin_lock_irqsave()' also here, as there is no guarantee that
interruptions are disabled at that point, according to surrounding code.
