introduction of regset ->get() wrappers, switching ELF coredumps to those

Two new helpers: given a process and regset, dump into a buffer.
regset_get() takes a buffer and size, regset_get_alloc() takes size
and allocates a buffer.

Return value in both cases is the amount of data actually dumped in
case of success or -E...  on error.

In both cases the size is capped by regset->n * regset->size, so
->get() is called with offset 0 and size no more than what regset
expects.

binfmt_elf.c callers of ->get() are switched to using those; the other
caller (copy_regset_to_user()) will need some preparations to switch.
