media: i2c: Add MAX9286 driver

The MAX9286 is a 4-channel GMSL deserializer with coax or STP input and
CSI-2 output. The device supports multicamera streaming applications,
and features the ability to synchronise the attached cameras.

CSI-2 output can be configured with 1 to 4 lanes, and a control channel
is supported over I2C, which implements an I2C mux to facilitate
communications with connected cameras across the reverse control
channel.
