btrfs: convert block group refcount to refcount_t

We have refcount_t now with the associated library to handle refcounts,
which gives us extra debugging around reference count mistakes that may
be made.  For example it'll warn on any transition from 0->1 or 0->-1,
which is handy for noticing cases where we've messed up reference
counting.  Convert the block group ref counting from an atomic_t to
refcount_t and use the appropriate helpers.
