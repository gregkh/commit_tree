drm/i915/selftests: Exercise far preemption rollbacks

Not too long ago, we realised we had issues with a rolling back a
context so far for a preemption request we considered the resubmit not
to be a rollback but a forward roll. This means we would issue a lite
restore instead of forcing a full restore, continuing execution of the
old requests rather than causing a preemption. Add a selftest to
exercise such a far rollback, such that if we were to skip the full
restore, we would execute invalid instructions in the ring and hang.

Note that while I was able to confirm that this causes us to do a
lite-restore preemption rollback (with commit e36ba817fa96 ("drm/i915/gt:
Incrementally check for rewinding") disabled), it did not trick the HW
into rolling past the old RING_TAIL. Myybe on other HW.
