RDMA: Add support to dump resource tracker in RAW format

Add support to get resource dump in raw format. It enable drivers to
return the entire device specific QP/CQ/MR context without a need from the
driver to set each field separately.

The raw query returns only the device specific data, general data is still
returned by using the existing queries.

Example:

$ rdma res show mr dev mlx5_1 mrn 2 -r -j
[{"ifindex":7,"ifname":"mlx5_1",
"data":[0,4,255,254,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,28,0,216,...]}]
