clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: Mark clocks as critical only if on at boot

This allows us to add the RWDT clock to the list of critical clocks without
keeping it enabled needlessly if not used.

Changing the semantics of crit_mod_clks in this way is safe for the current
user (INTC-AP) because it is never off at boot time.
