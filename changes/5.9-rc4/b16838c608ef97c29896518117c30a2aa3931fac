kbuild: trace functions in subdirectories of lib/

ccflags-remove-$(CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER) += $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE)

exists here in sub-directories of lib/ to keep the behavior of
commit 2464a609ded0 ("ftrace: do not trace library functions").

Since that commit, not only the objects in lib/ but also the ones in
the sub-directories are excluded from ftrace (although the commit
description did not explicitly mention this).

However, most of library functions in sub-directories are not so hot.
Re-add them to ftrace.

Going forward, only the objects right under lib/ will be excluded.
