lib/test_vmalloc.c: Add test cases for kvfree_rcu()

Introduce four new test cases for testing the kvfree_rcu()
interface. Two of them belong to single argument functionality
and another two for 2-argument functionality.

The aim is to stress and check how kvfree_rcu() behaves under
different load and memory conditions and analyze its performance
throughput.
