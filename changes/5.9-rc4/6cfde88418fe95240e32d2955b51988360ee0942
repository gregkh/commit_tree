clk: drop unused function __clk_get_flags

The function __clk_get_flags has not been used since the April 2019
commit a348f05361c9 ("ARM: omap2+: hwmod: drop CLK_IS_BASIC
flag usage").  Other uses were removed in June 2015, eg by
commit 98d8a60eccee ("clk: Convert __clk_get_flags() to
clk_hw_get_flags()"), which shows how clk_hw_get_flags can easily
be used instead.
