usb: hcd: Fix use after free in usb_hcd_pci_remove()

On the removal stage we put a reference to the controller structure and
if it's not used anymore it gets freed, but later we try to dereference
a pointer to a member of that structure.

Copy necessary field to a temporary variable to avoid use after free.
