nvme: skip noiob for zoned devices

Zoned block devices reuse the chunk_sectors queue limit to define zone
boundaries. If a such a device happens to also report an optimal
boundary, do not use that to define the chunk_sectors as that may
intermittently interfere with io splitting and zone size queries.
