media: videobuf2: add cache management members

Extend vb2_buffer and vb2_queue structs with cache management
members.

V4L2 UAPI already contains two buffer flags which user-space,
supposedly, can use to control buffer cache sync:

- V4L2_BUF_FLAG_NO_CACHE_INVALIDATE
- V4L2_BUF_FLAG_NO_CACHE_CLEAN

None of these, however, do anything at the moment. This patch
set is intended to change it.

Since user-space cache management hints are supposed to be
implemented on a per-buffer basis we need to extend vb2_buffer
struct with two new members ->need_cache_sync_on_prepare and
->need_cache_sync_on_finish, which will store corresponding
user-space hints.

In order to preserve the existing behaviour, user-space cache
managements flags will be handled only by those drivers that
permit user-space cache hints. That's the purpose of vb2_queue
->allow_cache_hints member. Driver must set ->allow_cache_hints
during queue initialisation to enable cache management hints
mechanism.
