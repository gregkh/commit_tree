powerpc/watchpoint: Fix DAWR exception for CACHEOP

'ea' returned by analyse_instr() needs to be aligned down to cache
block size for CACHEOP instructions. analyse_instr() does not set
size for CACHEOP, thus size also needs to be calculated manually.

Fixes: 74c6881019b7 ("powerpc/watchpoint: Prepare handler to handle more than one watchpoint")
