net: dp83869: Fix RGMII internal delay configuration

The RGMII control register at 0x32 indicates the states for the bits
RGMII_TX_CLK_DELAY and RGMII_RX_CLK_DELAY as follows:

  RGMII Transmit/Receive Clock Delay
    0x0 = RGMII transmit clock is shifted with respect to transmit/receive data.
    0x1 = RGMII transmit clock is aligned with respect to transmit/receive data.

This commit fixes the inversed behavior of these bits
