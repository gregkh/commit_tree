KVM: MMU: stop dereferencing vcpu->arch.mmu to get the context for MMU init

kvm_init_shadow_mmu() was actually the only function that could be called
with different vcpu->arch.mmu values.  Now that kvm_init_shadow_npt_mmu()
is separated from kvm_init_shadow_mmu(), we always know the MMU context
we need to use and there is no need to dereference vcpu->arch.mmu pointer.
