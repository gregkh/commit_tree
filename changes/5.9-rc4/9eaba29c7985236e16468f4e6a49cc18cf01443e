s390/runtime_instrumentation: fix storage key handling

The key member of the runtime instrumentation control block contains
only the access key, not the complete storage key. Therefore the value
must be shifted by four bits.
Note: this is only relevant for debugging purposes in case somebody
compiles a kernel with a default storage access key set to a value not
equal to zero.
