scripts/kernel-doc: handle function pointer prototypes

There are some function pointer prototypes inside the net
includes, like this one:

	int (*pcs_config)(struct phylink_config *config, unsigned int mode,
			  phy_interface_t interface, const unsigned long *advertising);

There's nothing wrong using it with kernel-doc, but we need to
add a rule for it to parse such kind of prototype.
