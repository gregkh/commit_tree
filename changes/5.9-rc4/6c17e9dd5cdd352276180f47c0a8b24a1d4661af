ASoC: hda/tegra: Set buffer alignment to 128 bytes

Set chip->align_buffer_size to 1 for Tegra platforms to make the buffer
alignment to be multiple of 128 bytes. This fix is applied as gstreamer
alsasink gets stuck with the default buffer-time and latency-time
parameters with 4 byte buffer alignment.
