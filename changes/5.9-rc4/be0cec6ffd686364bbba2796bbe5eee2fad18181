qed: introduce qed_chain_get_elem_used{,u32}()

Add reverse-variants of qed_chain_get_elem_left{,u32}() to be able to
know current chain occupation. They will be used in the upcoming qede
XDP_REDIRECT code.
They share most of the logics with the mentioned ones, so were reused
to collapse the latters.
