block: add capacity field to zone descriptors

In the zoned storage model, the sectors within a zone are typically all
writeable. With the introduction of the Zoned Namespace (ZNS) Command
Set in the NVM Express organization, the model was extended to have a
specific writeable capacity.

Extend the zone descriptor data structure with a zone capacity field to
indicate to the user how many sectors in a zone are writeable.

Introduce backward compatibility in the zone report ioctl by extending
the zone report header data structure with a flags field to indicate if
the capacity field is available.
