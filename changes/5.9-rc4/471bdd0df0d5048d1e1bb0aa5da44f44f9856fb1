drm/i915/dp_mst: Work around out-of-spec adapters filtering short pulses

Some TypeC -> native DP adapters, at least the Club 3D CAC-1557 adapter,
incorrectly filter out HPD short pulses with a duration less than
~540 usec, leading to MST probe failures.

According to the DP Standard 2.0 section 5.1.4:
- DP sinks should generate short pulses in the 500 usec -> 1 msec range
- DP sources should detect short pulses in the 250 usec -> 2 msec range

According to the DP Alt Mode on TypeC Standard section 3.9.2, adapters
should detect and forward short pulses according to how sources should
detect them as specified in the DP Standard (250 usec -> 2 msec).

Based on the above filtering out short pulses with a duration less than
540 usec is incorrect.

To make such adapters work add support for a driver polling on MST
inerrupt flags, and wire this up in the i915 driver. The sink can clear
an interrupt it raised after 110 msec if the source doesn't respond, so
use a 50 msec poll period to avoid missing an interrupt. Polling of the
MST interrupt flags is explicitly allowed by the DP Standard.

This fixes MST probe failures I saw using this adapter and a DELL U2515H
monitor.

v2:
- Fix the wait event timeout for the no-poll case.
v3 (Ville):
- Fix the short pulse duration limits in the commit log prescribed by the
  DP Standard.
- Add code comment explaining why/how polling is used.
- Factor out a helper to schedule the port's hpd irq handler and move it
  to the rest of hotplug handlers.
- Document the new MST callback.
