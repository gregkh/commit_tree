fanotify: generalize the handling of extra event flags

In fanotify_group_event_mask() there is logic in place to make sure we
are not going to handle an event with no type and just FAN_ONDIR flag.
Generalize this logic to any FANOTIFY_EVENT_FLAGS.

There is only one more flag in this group at the moment -
FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD. We never report it to user, but we do pass it in to
fanotify_alloc_event() when group is reporting fid as indication that
event happened on child. We will have use for this indication later on.
