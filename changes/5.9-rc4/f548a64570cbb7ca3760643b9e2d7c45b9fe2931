MAINTAINERS: update Cavium/Marvell entries

I am leaving Marvell and already do not have access to my @marvell.com
email address.  So switching over to my korg mail address or removing my
address there another maintainer is already listed.  For the entries
there no other maintainer is listed I will keep looking into patches for
Cavium systems for a while until someone from Marvell takes it over.

Since I might have limited access to hardware and also limited time I
changed state to 'Odd Fixes' for those entries.
