media: vb2: Print the queue pointer in debug messages

When debugging issues that involve more than one video queue, messages
related to multiple queues get interleaved without any easy way to tell
which queue they relate to. Fix this by adding a queue name to
vb2_queue, and printing it in all debug messages in the vb2 core and
V4L2 layers. If the name isn't set by drivers, it is automatically
filled with the queue direction and address.
