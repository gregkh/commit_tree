sctp: not disable bh in the whole sctp_get_port_local()

With disabling bh in the whole sctp_get_port_local(), when
snum == 0 and too many ports have been used, the do-while
loop will take the cpu for a long time and cause cpu stuck:

  [ ] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#11 stuck for 22s!
  [ ] RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x4de/0x940
  [ ] Call Trace:
  [ ]  _raw_spin_lock+0xc1/0xd0
  [ ]  sctp_get_port_local+0x527/0x650 [sctp]
  [ ]  sctp_do_bind+0x208/0x5e0 [sctp]

  [ ]  sctp_connect_new_asoc+0x355/0x480 [sctp]
  [ ]  __sctp_connect+0x360/0xb10 [sctp]

There's no need to disable bh in the whole function of
sctp_get_port_local. So fix this cpu stuck by removing
local_bh_disable() called at the beginning, and using
spin_lock_bh() instead.

The same thing was actually done for inet_csk_get_port() in
Commit ea8add2b1903 ("tcp/dccp: better use of ephemeral
ports in bind()").

Thanks to Marcelo for pointing the buggy code out.

v1->v2:
  - use cond_resched() to yield cpu to other tasks if needed,
    as Eric noticed.
