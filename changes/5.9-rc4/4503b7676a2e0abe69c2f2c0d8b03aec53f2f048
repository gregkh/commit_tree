io_uring: catch -EIO from buffered issue request failure

-EIO bubbles up like -EAGAIN if we fail to allocate a request at the
lower level. Play it safe and treat it like -EAGAIN in terms of sync
retry, to avoid passing back an errant -EIO.

Catch some of these early for block based file, as non-mq devices
generally do not support NOWAIT. That saves us some overhead by
not first trying, then retrying from async context. We can go straight
to async punt instead.
