Drivers: hv: vmbus: Use channel_mutex in channel_vp_mapping_show()

The primitive currently uses channel->lock to protect the loop over
sc_list w.r.t. list additions/deletions but it doesn't protect the
target_cpu(s) loads w.r.t. a concurrent target_cpu_store(): while the
data races on target_cpu are hardly of any concern here, replace the
channel->lock critical section with a channel_mutex critical section
and extend the latter to include the loads of target_cpu; this same
pattern is also used in hv_synic_cleanup().
