l2tp: remove build_header callback in struct l2tp_session

The structure of an L2TP data packet header varies depending on the
version of the L2TP protocol being used.

struct l2tp_session used to have a build_header callback to abstract
this difference away.  It's clearer to simply choose the correct
function to use when building the data packet (and we save on the
function pointer in the session structure).

This approach does mean dereferencing the parent tunnel structure in
order to determine the tunnel version, but we're doing that in the
transmit path in any case.
