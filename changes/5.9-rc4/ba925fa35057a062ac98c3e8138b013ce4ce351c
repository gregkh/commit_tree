s390/gmap: improve THP splitting

During s390_enable_sie(), we need to take care of splitting all qemu user
process THP mappings. This is currently done with follow_page(FOLL_SPLIT),
by simply iterating over all vma ranges, with PAGE_SIZE increment.

This logic is sub-optimal and can result in a lot of unnecessary overhead,
especially when using qemu and ASAN with large shadow map. Ilya reported
significant system slow-down with one CPU busy for a long time and overall
unresponsiveness.

Fix this by using walk_page_vma() and directly calling split_huge_pmd()
only for present pmds, which greatly reduces overhead.
