drm/bridge: tfp410: fix de-skew value retrieval from DT

The tfp410 has a data de-skew feature that allows the user to compensate
the skew between IDCK and the pixel data and control signals.

In the driver, the setup and hold times are calculated from the de-skew
value. This retrieves the deskew value from the DT using the proper
datatype and range check as described by the binding (u32 from 0 to 7).

This fix results from a change in the ti,tfp410 DT binding.
