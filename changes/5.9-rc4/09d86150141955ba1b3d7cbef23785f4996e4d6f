fpga: dfl: afu: add AFU interrupt support

AFU (Accelerated Function Unit) is dynamic region of the DFL based FPGA,
and always defined by users. Some DFL based FPGA cards allow users to
implement their own interrupts in AFU. In order to support this,
hardware implements a new UINT (AFU Interrupt) private feature with
related capability register which describes the number of supported
AFU interrupts as well as the local index of the interrupts for
software enumeration, and from software side, driver follows the common
DFL interrupt notification and handling mechanism, and it implements
two ioctls below for user to query number of irqs supported and set/unset
interrupt triggers.

 Ioctls:
 * DFL_FPGA_PORT_UINT_GET_IRQ_NUM
   get the number of irqs, which is used to determine how many interrupts
   UINT feature supports.

 * DFL_FPGA_PORT_UINT_SET_IRQ
   set/unset eventfds as AFU interrupt triggers.
