xen networking: add basic XDP support for xen-netfront

The patch adds a basic XDP processing to xen-netfront driver.

We ran an XDP program for an RX response received from netback
driver. Also we request xen-netback to adjust data offset for
bpf_xdp_adjust_head() header space for custom headers.

synchronization between frontend and backend parts is done
by using xenbus state switching:
Reconfiguring -> Reconfigured- > Connected

UDP packets drop rate using xdp program is around 310 kpps
using ./pktgen_sample04_many_flows.sh and 160 kpps without the patch.
