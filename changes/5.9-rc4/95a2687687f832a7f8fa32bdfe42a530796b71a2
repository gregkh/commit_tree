drm/amdgpu/smu: rework i2c adpater registration

The i2c init/fini functions just register the i2c adapter.
There is no need to call them during hw init/fini.  They only
need to be called once per driver init/fini.  The previous
behavior broke runtime pm because we unregistered the i2c
adapter during suspend.
