MIPS: SGI-IP27: always enable NUMA in Kconfig

When a configuration has NUMA disabled and SGI_IP27 enabled, the build
fails:

Before switch from discontigmem to sparsemem, there always was
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y because it was selected by DISCONTIGMEM.
Without DISCONTIGMEM it is possible to have SPARSEMEM without NUMA for
SGI_IP27 and as many things there rely on custom node definition, the
build breaks.

As Thomas noted "... there are right now too many places in IP27 code,
which assumes NUMA enabled", the simplest solution would be to always
enable NUMA for SGI-IP27 builds.
