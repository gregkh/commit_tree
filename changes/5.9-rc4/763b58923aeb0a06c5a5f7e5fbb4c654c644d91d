block: clarify context for refcount increment helpers

Let us clarify the context under which the helpers to increment the
refcount for the gendisk and request_queue can be called under. We
make this explicit on the places where we may sleep with might_sleep().

We don't address the decrement context yet, as that needs some extra
work and fixes, but will be addressed in the next patch.
