drm/i915: Mark untiled BLT commands as fenced on gen2/3

The BLT commands on gen2/3 utilize the fence registers and so we cannot
modify any fences for the object whilst those commands are in flight.
Currently we marked tiled commands as occupying a fence, but forgot to
restrict the untiled commands from preventing a fence being assigned
before they were completed.

One side-effect is that we ten have to double check that a fence was
allocated for a fenced buffer during move-to-active.
