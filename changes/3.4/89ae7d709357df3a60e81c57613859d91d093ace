Staging: hv: storvsc: Move the storage driver out of the staging area

The storage driver (storvsc_drv.c) handles all block storage devices
assigned to Linux guests hosted on Hyper-V. This driver has been in the
staging tree for a while and this patch moves it out of the staging area.

James was willing to apply this patch during the 3.3-rc phase and a decision
was taken to defer this to 3.4 since Greg had queued up a bunch of storvsc
patches for 3.4. Now that Greg has applied all of the pending storvsc patches,
I am sending this patch to move this driver out of staging. Based on James'
recommendation, this patch gets rid of the unneeded files in the staging/hv
directory.
