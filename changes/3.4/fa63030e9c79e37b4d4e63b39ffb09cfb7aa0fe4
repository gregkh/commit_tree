x86/platform: Move APIC ID validity check into platform APIC code

Move APIC ID validity check into platform APIC code, so it can
be overridden when needed. For NumaChip systems, always trust
MADT, as it's constructed with high APIC IDs.

Behaviour verifies on standard x86 systems and on NumaChip
systems with this, and compile-tested with allyesconfig.
