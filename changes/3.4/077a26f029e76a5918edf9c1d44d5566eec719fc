tipc: Eliminate obsolete support for "not running" mode

Removes all references to TIPC's "not running" mode, since the
removal of support for the native API means that there is no longer
any way to interact with TIPC if it has not been initialized.

The changes made consist of removing mode-based checks that are no
longer needed, along with any associated code lying on non-executable
control paths.
