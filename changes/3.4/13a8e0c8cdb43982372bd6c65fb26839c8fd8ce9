bonding: don't increase rx_dropped after processing LACPDUs

Since commit 3aba891d, bonding processes LACP frames (802.3ad
mode) with bond_handle_frame(). Currently a copy of the skb is
made and the original is left to be processed by other
rx_handlers and the rest of the network stack by returning
RX_HANDLER_ANOTHER.  As there is no protocol handler for
PKT_TYPE_LACPDU, the frame is dropped and dev->rx_dropped
increased.

Fix this by making bond_handle_frame() return RX_HANDLER_CONSUMED
if bonding has processed the LACP frame.
