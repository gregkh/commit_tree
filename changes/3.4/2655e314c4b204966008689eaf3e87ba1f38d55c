iwlwifi: trace debug messages

Make iwlwifi record all debug messages into
tracing, even if debug_level is not enabled.
Due to the lack of APIs, the debug messages
are now recorded up to a max length of 100,
the only one above that is the RXON which is
not needed if you trace the commands as well
as it only dumps the command contents.
