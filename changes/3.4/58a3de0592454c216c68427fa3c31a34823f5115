mlx4_core: fix race on comm channel

Prevent race condition between commands on comm channel.
Happened while unloading the driver when switching from
event to polling mode. VF got completion on the last command
before switching to polling mode, but toggle was not changed.
After the fix - VF will not write the next command before
toggle is updated.
