mmc: sdhci-s3c: Remove usage of clk_type member in platform data

SDHCI controllers on Exynos4 do not include the sdclk divider as per the
sdhci controller specification. This case can be represented using the
sdhci quirk SDHCI_QUIRK_NONSTANDARD_CLOCK instead of using an additional
enum type definition 'clk_types'.

Hence, usage of clk_type member in platform data is removed and the sdhci
quirk is used. In addition to that, since this qurik is SoC specific,
driver data is introduced to represent controllers on SoC's that require
this quirk.
