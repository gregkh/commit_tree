signal: zap_pid_ns_processes: s/SEND_SIG_NOINFO/SEND_SIG_FORCED/

Change zap_pid_ns_processes() to use SEND_SIG_FORCED, it looks more
clear compared to SEND_SIG_NOINFO which relies on from_ancestor_ns logic
send_signal().

It is also more efficient if we need to kill a lot of tasks because it
doesn't alloc sigqueue.

While at it, add the __fatal_signal_pending(task) check as a minor
optimization.
