HID: add support for tivo slide remote

This patch finishes off adding full support for the TiVo Slide remote,
which is a mostly pure HID device from the perspective of the kernel.
There are a few mappings that use a vendor-specific usage page, and a
few keys in the consumer usage page that I think make sense to remap
slightly, to better fit their key labels' intended use. Doing this in a
stand-alone hid-tivo.c makes the modifications only matter for this
specific device.

What's actually connected to the computer is a Broadcom-made usb dongle,
which has an embedded hub, bluetooth adapter, mouse and keyboard
devices. You pair with the dongle, then the remote sends data that its
converted into HID on the keyboard interface (the mouse interface
doesn't do anything interesting, so far as I can tell).

lsusb for this device:
Bus 004 Device 005: ID 0a5c:2190 Broadcom Corp.
Bus 004 Device 004: ID 0a5c:4503 Broadcom Corp.
Bus 004 Device 003: ID 150a:1201
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 0a5c:4500 Broadcom Corp. BCM2046B1 USB 2.0 Hub (part of BCM2046 Bluetooth)

Speaking of the keyboard interface, the remote actually does contain a
keyboard as well. The top slides away, revealing a reasonably functional
qwerty keyboard (not unlike many slide cell phones), thus the product
name.
