usermodehelper: implement UMH_KILLABLE

Implement UMH_KILLABLE, should be used along with UMH_WAIT_EXEC/PROC.
The caller must ensure that subprocess_info->path/etc can not go away
until call_usermodehelper_freeinfo().

call_usermodehelper_exec(UMH_KILLABLE) does
wait_for_completion_killable.  If it fails, it uses
xchg(&sub_info->complete, NULL) to serialize with umh_complete() which
does the same xhcg() to access sub_info->complete.

If call_usermodehelper_exec wins, it can safely return.  umh_complete()
should get NULL and call call_usermodehelper_freeinfo().

Otherwise we know that umh_complete() was already called, in this case
call_usermodehelper_exec() falls back to wait_for_completion() which
should succeed "very soon".

Note: UMH_NO_WAIT == -1 but it obviously should not be used with
UMH_KILLABLE.  We delay the neccessary cleanup to simplify the back
porting.
