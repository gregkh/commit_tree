Bluetooth: Fix init sequence for some CSR based controllers

Some CSR controllers will generate a spontaneous reset during init and
just eat up any pending command without sending a command complete for
it. This patch solves the issue by just resending whatever was the last
sent command. hci_send_cmd is not used since we need to bypass all other
commands in the send queue.
