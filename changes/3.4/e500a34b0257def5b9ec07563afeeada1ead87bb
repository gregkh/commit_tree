[SCSI] libsas: kill invocation of scsi_eh_finish_cmd from sas_ata_task_done

Prior to the conversion to the new-style libata-eh sas_ata_task_done()
may have been the last opportunity to clean up the scmd, but now
libata-eh explicitly handles this case.  It also races against sas-eh.
If a lldd completes a task after SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED is set it could
trigger a spurious decrement of shost->host_failed.  Current lldds have
the band-aid of checking SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED before calling
->task_done(), but better to just let the scmds escalate to libata for
race free cleanup.
