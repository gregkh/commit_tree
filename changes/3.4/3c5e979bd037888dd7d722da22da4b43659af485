net: smsc911x: fix skb handling in receive path

The SMSC911x driver resets the ->head, ->data and ->tail pointers in the
skb on the reset path in order to avoid buffer overflow due to packet
padding performed by the hardware.

This patch fixes the receive path so that the skb pointers are fixed up
after the data has been read from the device, The error path is also
fixed to use number of words consistently and prevent erroneous FIFO
fastforwarding when skipping over bad data.
