gpio: Add a driver for Sodaville GPIO controller

Sodaville has GPIO controller behind the PCI bus. To my suprissed it is
not the same as on PXA.

The interrupt & gpio chip can be referenced from the device tree like
from any other driver. Unfortunately the driver which uses the gpio
interrupt has to use irq_of_parse_and_map() instead of
platform_get_irq(). The problem is that the platform device (which is
created from the device tree) is most likely created before the
interrupt chip is registered and therefore irq_of_parse_and_map() fails.

In theory the driver works as module. In reality most of the irq
functions are not exported to modules and it is possible that _this_
module is unloaded while the provided irqs are still in use.
