cgroup: revert ss_id_lock to spinlock

Commit c1e2ee2dc436 ("memcg: replace ss->id_lock with a rwlock") has now
been seen to cause the unfair behavior we should have expected from
converting a spinlock to an rwlock: softlockup in cgroup_mkdir(), whose
get_new_cssid() is waiting for the wlock, while there are 19 tasks using
the rlock in css_get_next() to get on with their memcg workload (in an
artificial test, admittedly).  Yet lib/idr.c was made suitable for RCU
way back: revert that commit, restoring ss->id_lock to a spinlock.
