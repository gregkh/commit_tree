acerhdf: lowered default temp fanon/fanoff values

Due to new supported hardware, of which the actual temperature limits of
processor, harddisk and other components are unknown, it feels safer with
lower fanon / fanoff settings.

It won't change much for most people, already using acerhdf, as they use
their own fanon/fanoff variable settings when loading the module.

Furthermore seems like kernel and userspace tools have been improved to
work more efficient and netbooks don't get so hot anymore.
