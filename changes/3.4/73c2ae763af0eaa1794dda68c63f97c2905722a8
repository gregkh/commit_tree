enic: remove assignment of random mac on enic vf

This patch removes random mac assignment on vf's. The vf's will start with
a zero mac and with upcoming support in fw/driver, a vf mac can be set
via the pf. vf's also support ndo_set_mac_address. This decision was made
based on the fact that a random mac on a vf is not really needed. And this
will reduce some of the problems with the vf's getting a new mac on
every driver load/unload (one of them being udev renaming the device on ever
load/unload and reboot).
