NFSv4.1: Fix a few issues in filelayout_commit_pagelist

- Fix a race in which NFS_I(inode)->commits_outstanding could potentially
  go to zero (triggering a call to nfs_commit_clear_lock()) before we're
  done sending out all the commit RPC calls.

- If nfs_commitdata_alloc fails, there is no reason why we shouldn't
  try to send off all the commits-to-ds.

- Simplify the error handling.

- Change pnfs_commit_list() to always return either
  PNFS_ATTEMPTED or PNFS_NOT_ATTEMPTED.
