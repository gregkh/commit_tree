mtd: flash drivers set ecc strength

Flash device drivers initialize 'ecc_strength' in struct mtd_info, which is the
maximum number of bit errors that can be corrected in one writesize region.

Drivers using the nand interface intitialize 'strength' in struct nand_ecc_ctrl,
which is the maximum number of bit errors that can be corrected in one ecc step.
Nand infrastructure code translates this to 'ecc_strength'.

Also for nand drivers, the nand infrastructure code sets ecc.strength for ecc
modes NAND_ECC_SOFT, NAND_ECC_SOFT_BCH, and NAND_ECC_NONE.  It is set in the
driver for all other modes.
