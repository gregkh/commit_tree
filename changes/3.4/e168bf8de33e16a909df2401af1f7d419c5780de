KVM: s390: ucontrol: export page faults to user

This patch introduces a new exit reason in the kvm_run structure
named KVM_EXIT_S390_UCONTROL. This exit indicates, that a virtual cpu
has regognized a fault on the host page table. The idea is that
userspace can handle this fault by mapping memory at the fault
location into the cpu's address space and then continue to run the
virtual cpu.
