perf record: Add HEADER_BRANCH_STACK tag

This patch adds a new feature bit, namely,
HEADER_BRANCH_STACK.  When present, it indicates
that sample records may contain branch stack.

This could be useful to a viewer to switch to
branch mode without having to parse all the
samples or without a specific cmdline option.

This will be used in a subsequent patch to
enhance perf report with branch stacks.
