TTY: remove tty driver re-set from tty_reopen

This is from tty_reopen:
    struct tty_driver *driver = tty->driver;
    ...
    tty->driver = driver;
and it doesn't make sense at all. The driver is intended to be set in
initialize_tty_struct from tty_init_dev (initial open). So this set in
tty_reopen is not needed.
