AppArmor: Move path failure information into aa_get_name and rename

Move the path name lookup failure messages into the main path name lookup
routine, as the information is useful in more than just aa_path_perm.

Also rename aa_get_name to aa_path_name as it is not getting a reference
counted object with a corresponding put fn.
