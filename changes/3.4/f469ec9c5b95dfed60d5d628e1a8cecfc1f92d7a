fs: Remove bogus wait in write_inode_now()

inode_sync_wait() in write_inode_now() is just bogus. That function waits for
I_SYNC bit to be cleared but writeback_single_inode() clears the bit on return
so the wait is effectivelly a nop unless someone else submits the inode for
writeback again. All the waiting write_inode_now() needs is achieved by using
WB_SYNC_ALL writeback mode.
