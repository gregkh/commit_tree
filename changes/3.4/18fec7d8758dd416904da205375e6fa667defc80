rcu: Improve synchronize_rcu() diagnostics

Although TREE_PREEMPT_RCU indirectly uses might_sleep() to detect illegal
use of synchronize_sched() and synchronize_rcu_bh() from within an RCU
read-side critical section, this might_sleep() check is bypassed when
there is only a single CPU (for example, when running an SMP kernel on
a single-CPU system).  This patch therefore adds a might_sleep() call
to the rcu_blocking_is_gp() check that is unconditionally invoked from
both synchronize_sched() and synchronize_rcu_bh().
