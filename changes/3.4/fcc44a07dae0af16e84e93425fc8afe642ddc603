mtd: lart: initialize writebufsize

The writebufsize concept was introduce by commit
"0e4ca7e mtd: add writebufsize field to mtd_info struct" and it represents
the maximum amount of data the device writes to the media at a time. This is
an important parameter for UBIFS which is used during recovery and which
basically defines how big a corruption caused by a power cut can be.

Set writebufsize to 4 because this drivers writes at max 4 bytes at a time.
