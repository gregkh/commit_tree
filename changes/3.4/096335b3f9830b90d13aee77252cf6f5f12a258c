mlx4_core: Allow dynamic MTU configuration for IB ports

Set the MTU for IB ports in the driver instead of using the firmware
default of 2KB (the driver defaults to 4KB).  Allow for dynamic mtu
configuration through a new, per-port sysfs entry.

Since there's a dependency between the port MTU and the max number of
HW VLs the port can support, apply a mim/max approach, using a loop
that goes down from the highest possible number of VLs to the lowest,
using the firmware return status to know whether the requested number
of VLs is possible with a given MTU.

For now, as with the dynamic link type change / VPI support, the sysfs
entry to change the mtu is exposed only when NOT running in SR-IOV
mode.  To allow changing the MTU for the master in SR-IOV mode,
primary-function-initiated FLR (Function Level Reset) needs to be
implemented.
