SUNRPC: clear svc pools lists helper introduced

This patch moves removing of service transport from it's pools ready lists to
separated function. Also this clear is now done with list_for_each_entry_safe()
helper.
This is a precursor patch, which would be usefull with service shutdown in
network namespace context, introduced later in the series.
