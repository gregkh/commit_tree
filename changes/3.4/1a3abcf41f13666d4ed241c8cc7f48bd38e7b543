ARM: 7418/1: LPAE: fix access flag setup in mem_type_table

A zero value for prot_sect in the memory types table implies that
section mappings should never be created for the memory type in question.
This is checked for in alloc_init_section().

With LPAE, we set a bit to mask access flag faults for kernel mappings.
This breaks the aforementioned (!prot_sect) check in alloc_init_section().

This patch fixes this bug by first checking for a non-zero
prot_sect before setting the PMD_SECT_AF flag.
