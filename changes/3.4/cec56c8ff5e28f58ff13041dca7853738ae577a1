svcrdma: Cleanup sparse warnings in the svcrdma module

The svcrdma transport was un-marshalling requests in-place. This resulted
in sparse warnings due to __beXX data containing both NBO and HBO data.

The code has been restructured to do byte-swapping as the header is
parsed instead of when the header is validated immediately after receipt.

Also moved extern declarations for the workqueue and memory pools to the
private header file.
