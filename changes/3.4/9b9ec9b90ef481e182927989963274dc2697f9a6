rcutorture: Permit holding off CPU-hotplug operations during boot

When rcutorture is started automatically at boot time, it might well
also start CPU-hotplug operations at that time, which might not be
desirable.  This commit therefore adds an rcutorture parameter that
allows CPU-hotplug operations to be held off for the specified number
of seconds after the start of boot.
