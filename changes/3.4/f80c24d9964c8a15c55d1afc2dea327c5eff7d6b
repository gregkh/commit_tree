tipc: Add check to prevent insertion of duplicate name table entries

Adds a new check to TIPC's name table logic to reject any attempt to
create a new name publication that is identical to an existing one.
(Such an attempt will never happen under normal circumstances, but
could arise if another network node malfunctions and issues a duplicate
name publication message.)
