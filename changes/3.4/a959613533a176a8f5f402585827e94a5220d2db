Revert "kconfig: fix __enabled_ macros definition for invisible and un-selected symbols"

This reverts commit 953742c8fe8ac45be453fee959d7be40cd89f920.

Dumping two lines into autoconf.h for all existing Kconfig options
results in a giant file (~16k lines) we have to process each time we
compile something.  We've weaned IS_ENABLED() and similar off of
requiring the __enabled_ definitions so now we can revert the change
which caused all the extra lines.
