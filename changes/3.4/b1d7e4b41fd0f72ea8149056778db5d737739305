drm/i915: add a "force-dvi" HDMI audio mode

When HDMI-DVI converter is used, it's not only necessary to turn off
audio, but also to disable HDMI_MODE_SELECT and video infoframe. Since
the DVI mode is mainly tied to audio functionality from end user POV,
add a new "force-dvi" audio mode:

	xrandr --output HDMI1 --set audio force-dvi

Note that most users won't need to set this and happily rely on the EDID
based DVI auto detection.
