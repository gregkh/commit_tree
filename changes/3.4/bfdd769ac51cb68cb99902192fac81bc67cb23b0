m68knommu: fix id number for second eth device on 5275 ColdFire

The second ColdFire FEC ethernet device should have an id number of 1,
not 0. Otherwise it clashes with the first FEC ethernet device.

On booting a kernel on a 5275 based board you will get messages out of
the kernel like this:

    <4>------------[ cut here ]------------
    <4>WARNING: at fs/sysfs/dir.c:508 0x0a8b50()
    <4>sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename 'fec.0'

And likely you won't be able to completely boot up after this at all.
