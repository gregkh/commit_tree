hwmon: (k10temp) Add support for AMD Trinity CPUs

The on-chip northbridge's temperature sensor of the upcoming
AMD Trinity CPUs works the same as for the previous CPUs.
Since it has a different PCI-ID, we just add the new one to the list
supported by k10temp.
This allows to use the k10temp driver on those CPUs.
