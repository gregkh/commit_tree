tcp: restore correct limit

Commit c43b874d5d714f (tcp: properly initialize tcp memory limits) tried
to fix a regression added in commits 4acb4190 & 3dc43e3,
but still get it wrong.

Result is machines with low amount of memory have too small tcp_rmem[2]
value and slow tcp receives : Per socket limit being 1/1024 of memory
instead of 1/128 in old kernels, so rcv window is capped to small
values.

Fix this to match comment and previous behavior.
