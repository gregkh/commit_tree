GFS2: Eliminate sd_rindex_mutex

Over time, we've slowly eliminated the use of sd_rindex_mutex.
Up to this point, it was only used in two places: function
gfs2_ri_total (which totals the file system size by reading
and parsing the rindex file) and function gfs2_rindex_update
which updates the rgrps in memory. Both of these functions have
the rindex glock to protect them, so the rindex is unnecessary.
Since gfs2_grow writes to the rindex via the meta_fs, the mutex
is in the wrong order according to the normal rules. This patch
eliminates the mutex entirely to avoid the problem.
