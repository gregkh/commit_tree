rcu: Check for callback invocation from offline CPUs

Because quiescent states are now reported from offline CPUs in
CPU_DYING state, there is some possibility that such a CPU might
note the end of a grace period and attempt to start invoking
callbacks.  This would be a very bad thing, and is supposed to
be prevented by the fact that the CPU_DYING CPU gets rid of all
its callbacks before reporting the quiescent state.  However,
there is other CPU-offline code in the kernel, and it is quite
possible that someone will invoke RCU core processing from that
code.  Therefore, this commit adds a warning for this case.
