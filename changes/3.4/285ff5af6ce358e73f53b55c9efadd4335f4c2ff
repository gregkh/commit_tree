Btrfs: remove the ideal caching code

This is a relic from before we had the disk space cache and it was to make
bootup times when you had btrfs as root not be so damned slow.  Now that we have
the disk space cache this isn't a problem anymore and really having this code
casues uneeded fragmentation and complexity, so just remove it.  Thanks,
