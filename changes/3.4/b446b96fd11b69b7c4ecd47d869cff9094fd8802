UHCI: hub_status_data should indicate if ports are resuming

This patch (as1538) causes uhci_hub_status_data() to return a nonzero
value when any port is undergoing a resume transition while the root
hub is suspended.  This will allow usbcore to handle races between
root-hub suspend and port wakeup.
