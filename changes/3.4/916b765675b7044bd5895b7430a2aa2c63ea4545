TTY: serialP, merge serial_state and async_struct

This is the final step to get rid of the one of the structures.  A
further cleanup will follow. And I struct serial_state deserves cease
to exist after a switch to tty_port too.

While changing the lines, it removes also pointless tty->driver_data
casts.
