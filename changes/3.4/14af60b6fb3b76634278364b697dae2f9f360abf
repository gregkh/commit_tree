spi/pl022: Add high priority message pump support

This switches the PL022 worker to a kthread in order to get
hold of a mechanism to control the message pump priority. On
low-latency systems elevating the message kthread to realtime
priority give a real sleek response curve. This has been
confirmed by measurements. Realtime priority elevation for
a certain PL022 port can be requested from platform data.
