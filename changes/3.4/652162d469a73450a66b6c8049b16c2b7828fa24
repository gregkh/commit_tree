pinctrl: allow concurrent gpio and mux function ownership of pins

Per recent updates to Documentation/gpio.txt, gpiolib drivers should
inform pinctrl when a GPIO is requested. pinctrl then marks that pin as
in-use for that GPIO function.

When an SoC muxes pins in a group, it's quite possible for the group to
contain e.g. 6 pins, but only 4 of them actually be needed by the HW
module that's mux'd to them. In this case, the other 2 pins could be
used as GPIOs. However, pinctrl marks all the pins within the group as
in-use by the selected mux function. To allow the expected gpiolib
interaction, separate the concepts of pin ownership into two parts: One
for the mux function and one for GPIO usage. Finally, allow those two
ownerships to exist in parallel.
