ixgbe: Place skb on first buffer_info structure to avoid using stack space

Instead of keeping a local copy of the skb on the stack for as long as long
as we do it makes sense to instead just place it on the first tx_buffer
structure so that we can save space on the stack and avoid unnecessary
read/write operations copying the pointer out of the stack and onto the
ring later.
