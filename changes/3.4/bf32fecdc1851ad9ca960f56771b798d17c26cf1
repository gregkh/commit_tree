openvswitch: Add length check when retrieving TCP flags.

When collecting TCP flags we check that the IP header indicates that
a TCP header is present but not that the packet is actually long
enough to contain the header.  This adds a check to prevent reading
off the end of the packet.

In practice, this is only likely to result in reading of bad data and
not a crash due to the presence of struct skb_shared_info at the end
of the packet.
