TTY: isdn/gigaset, do not set tty->driver_data to NULL

Close the window in open where driver_data is reset to NULL on each
open. It could cause other processes to get invalid retval from the
tty->ops operations because of the checks all over the code.

With this change we may do other cleanups. Now, the only valid check
for tty->driver_data != NULL is in close. This can happen only if open
fails at gigaset_get_cs_by_tty or try_module_get. The rest of checks
in various tty->ops->* are invalid as driver_data cannot be NULL
there. The same holds for cs->open_count. So remove them.
