ext4: remove unused code from ext4_ext_map_blocks()

Since the commit 'Rewrite punch hole to use ext4_ext_remove_space()'
reworked the punch hole implementation to use ext4_ext_remove_space()
instead of ext4_ext_map_blocks(), we can remove the code which is no
longer needed from the ext4_ext_map_blocks().
