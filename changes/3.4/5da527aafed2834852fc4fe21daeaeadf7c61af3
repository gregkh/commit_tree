printk(): add KERN_CONT where needed in hpet and vt code

A prototype for kmsg records instead of a byte-stream buffer revealed
a couple of missing printk(KERN_CONT ...) uses. Subsequent calls produce
one record per printk() call, while all should have ended up in a single
record.

Instead of:
  ACPI: (supports S0 S5)
  ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] (IRQs 5 *10 11)
  hpet0: at MMIO 0xfed00000, IRQs 2 , 8 , 0

It prints:
  ACPI: (supports S0
   S5
  )
  ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] (IRQs
   5
   *10
   11
  )
  hpet0: at MMIO 0xfed00000, IRQs
   2
  , 8
  , 0
