amba-pl011â€‹/dma: Add check for the residue in DMA callback

In DMA-operated uart, I found that rx data can be taken by the UART
interrupts during the DMA irq handler. pl011_int is occurred just
before it goes inside spin_lock_irq. When it returns to the callback,
DMA buffer already has been flushed. Then, pl011_dma_rx_chars gets
invalid data. So I add check for the residue as the patch bellow.
