e1000e: cleanup: use goto for common work needed by multiple exit points

There are two exit points of e1000e_write_nvm_spi() which require the
nvm->ops.release() function pointer called just before exiting.
Consolidate the two duplicate pieces of common work with a goto.  With
this change, the value ret_val will need to be returned instead of 0.
