ACPI: Fix unprotected smp_processor_id() in acpi_processor_cst_has_changed()

The acpi_processor_cst_has_changed() function is invoked from a
CPU_ONLINE or CPU_DEAD function, which might well execute on CPU 0
even though the CPU being hotplugged is some other CPU.  In addition,
acpi_processor_cst_has_changed() invokes smp_processor_id() without
protection, resulting in splats when onlining CPUs.

This commit therefore changes the smp_processor_id() to pr->id, as is
used elsewhere in the code, for example, in acpi_processor_add().
