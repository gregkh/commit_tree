Bluetooth: Remove HCI-owner field

After unregistering an hci_dev object a bluetooth driver does not have
any callbacks in the hci_dev structure left over. Therefore, there is no
need to keep a reference to the module.

Previously, we needed this to protect the hci-destruct callback.
However, this callback is no longer available so we do not need this
owner field, anymore.  Drivers now call hci_unregister_dev() and they
are done with the object.
