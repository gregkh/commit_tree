net/mlx4_en: Saving mem access on data path

Localized the pdev->dev, and using dma_map instead of pci_map
There are multiple map/unmap operations on data path,
optimizing those by saving redundant pointer access.
Those places were identified as hot-spots when running kernel profiling
during some benchmarks.
The fixes had most impact when testing packet rate with small packets,
reducing several % from CPU load, and in some case being the difference
between reaching wire speed or being CPU bound.
