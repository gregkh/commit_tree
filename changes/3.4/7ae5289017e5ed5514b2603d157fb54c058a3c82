tg3: Fix RSS ring refill race condition

The RSS feature in tg3 hardware has only one rx producer ring for all
RSS rings.  NAPI vector 1 is special and handles the refilling of the
rx producer ring on behalf of all RSS rings.  There is a race condition
between these RSS NAPIs and the NAPI[1].  If NAPI[1] finishes checking
for refill and then another RSS ring empties the rx producer ring
before NAPI[1] exits NAPI, the chip will be completely out of SKBs in
the rx producer ring.

We fix this by adding a flag tp->rx_refill and rely on napi_schedule()/
napi_complete() to help synchronize it to close the race condition.

Update driver version to 3.123.
