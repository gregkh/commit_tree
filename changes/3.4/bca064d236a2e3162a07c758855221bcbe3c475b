libceph: use "do" in CRC-related Boolean variables

Change the name (and type) of a few CRC-related Boolean local
variables so they contain the word "do", to distingish their purpose
from variables used for holding an actual CRC value.

Note that in the process of doing this I identified a fairly serious
logic error in write_partial_msg_pages():  the value of "do_crc"
assigned appears to be the opposite of what it should be.  No
attempt to fix this is made here; this change preserves the
erroneous behavior.  The problem I found is documented here:
