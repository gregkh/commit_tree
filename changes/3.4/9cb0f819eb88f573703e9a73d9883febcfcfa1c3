USB: sa1111: sparse and checkpatch cleanups

Clean up the ohci-sa1111 driver formatting to be more compliant with
current standards, and add 'static' to various function definitions
to avoid sparse complaints about undeclared functions.  Remove the
unnecessary local declaration of 'usb_disabled', which can be found
instead in linux/usb.h.
