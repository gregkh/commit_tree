virtio_balloon: Fix endian bug

Although virtio config space fields are usually in guest-native endian,
the spec for the virtio balloon device explicitly states that both fields
in its config space are little-endian.

However, the current virtio_balloon driver does not have a suitable endian
swap for the 'num_pages' field, although it does have one for the 'actual'
field.  This patch corrects the bug, adding sparse annotation while we're
at it.
