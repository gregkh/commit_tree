[media] V4L2: Add per-device-node capabilities

If V4L2_CAP_DEVICE_CAPS is set, then the new device_caps field is filled with
the capabilities of the opened device node.

The capabilities field traditionally contains the capabilities of the physical
device, being a superset of all capabilities available at the several device
nodes. E.g., if you open /dev/video0, then if it contains VBI caps then that means
that there is a corresponding vbi node as well. And the capabilities field of
both the video and vbi nodes should contain identical caps.

However, it would be very useful to also have a capabilities field that contains
just the caps for the currently open device, hence the new CAP bit and field.
