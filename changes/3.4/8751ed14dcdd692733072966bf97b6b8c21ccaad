powerpc/8xx: Fix NR_IRQ bugs and refactor 8xx interrupt controller

The mpc8xx driver uses a reference to NR_IRQS that is buggy.  It uses
NR_IRQs for the array size of the ppc_cached_irq_mask bitmap, but
NR_IRQs could be smaller than the number of hardware irqs that
ppc_cached_irq_mask tracks.

Also, while fixing that problem, it became apparent that the interrupt
controller only supports 32 interrupt numbers, but it is written as if
it supports multiple register banks which is more complicated.

This patch pulls out the buggy reference to NR_IRQs and fixes the size
of the ppc_cached_irq_mask to match the number of HW irqs.  It also
drops the now-unnecessary code since ppc_cached_irq_mask is no longer
an array.
