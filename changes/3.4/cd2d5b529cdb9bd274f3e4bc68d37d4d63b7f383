sfc: Add SR-IOV back-end support for SFC9000 family

On the SFC9000 family, each port has 1024 Virtual Interfaces (VIs),
each with an RX queue, a TX queue, an event queue and a mailbox
register.  These may be assigned to up to 127 SR-IOV virtual functions
per port, with up to 64 VIs per VF.

We allocate an extra channel (IRQ and event queue only) to receive
requests from VF drivers.

There is a per-port limit of 4 concurrent RX queue flushes, and queue
flushes may be initiated by the MC in response to a Function Level
Reset (FLR) of a VF.  Therefore, when SR-IOV is in use, we submit all
flush requests via the MC.

The RSS indirection table is shared with VFs, so the number of RX
queues used in the PF is limited to the number of VIs per VF.

This is almost entirely the work of Steve Hodgson, formerly
