fs/namei.c: fix warnings on 32-bit

i386 allnoconfig:

  fs/namei.c: In function 'has_zero':
  fs/namei.c:1617: warning: integer constant is too large for 'unsigned long' type
  fs/namei.c:1617: warning: integer constant is too large for 'unsigned long' type
  fs/namei.c: In function 'hash_name':
  fs/namei.c:1635: warning: integer constant is too large for 'unsigned long' type

There must be a tidier way of doing this.
