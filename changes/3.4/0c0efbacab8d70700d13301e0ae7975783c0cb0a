firewire: ohci: fix too-early completion of IR multichannel buffers

handle_ir_buffer_fill() assumed that a completed descriptor would be
indicated by a non-zero transfer_status (as in most other descriptors).
However, this field is written by the controller as soon as (the end of)
the first packet has been written into the buffer.  As a consequence, if
we happen to run into such a descriptor when the interrupt handler is
executed after such a packet has completed, the descriptor would be
taken out of the list of active descriptors as soon as the buffer had
been partially filled, so the event for the buffer being completely
filled would never be sent.

To fix this, handle descriptors only when they have been completely
filled, i.e., when res_count == 0.  (This also matches the condition
that is reported by the controller with an interrupt.)
