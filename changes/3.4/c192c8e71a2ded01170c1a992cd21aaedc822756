USB: qcserial: don't grab QMI port on Gobi 1000 devices

Gobi 1000 devices have a different port layout, which wasn't respected
by the current driver, and thus it grabbed the QMI/net port.  In the
near future we'll be attaching another driver to the QMI/net port for
these devices (cdc-wdm and qmi_wwan) so make sure the qcserial driver
doesn't claim them.  This patch also prevents qcserial from binding to
interfaces 0 and 1 on 1K devices because those interfaces do not
respond.
