rtlwifi/rtl8192c: in _rtl92c_phy_calculate_bit_shift remove comparing bitmask against 1

in _rtl92c_phy_calculate_bit_shift everytime the right shifted bitmask
is AND with 1 and compared against 1. i.e.
       if ((bitmask >> i) & 0x1 == 1)
               break;
which in the if condition is anyway becomes a 1 or 0.
