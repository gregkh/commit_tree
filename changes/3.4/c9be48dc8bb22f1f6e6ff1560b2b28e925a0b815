l2tp: don't overwrite source address in l2tp_ip_bind()

Applications using L2TP/IP sockets want to be able to bind() an L2TP/IP
socket to set the local tunnel id while leaving the auto-assigned source
address alone. So if no source address is supplied, don't overwrite
the address already stored in the socket.
