kdb: Add message about CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA on failure to install breakpoint

On x86, if CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA is set, one cannot set breakpoints
via KDB.  Apparently this is a well-known problem, as at least one distribution
now ships with both KDB enabled and CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA=y for security reasons.

This patch adds an printk message to the breakpoint failure case,
in order to provide suggestions about how to use the debugger.
