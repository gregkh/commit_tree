sparc: use block_sigmask()

Use the new helper function introduced in commit 5e6292c0f28f ("signal:
add block_sigmask() for adding sigmask to current->blocked") which
centralises the code for updating current->blocked after successfully
delivering a signal and reduces the amount of duplicate code across
architectures.  In the past some architectures got this code wrong, so
using this helper function should stop that from happening again.
