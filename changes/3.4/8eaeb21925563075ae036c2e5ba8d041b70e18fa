regmap: add regmap_bulk_write() for register write

The bulk_write() supports the data transfer to multi
register which takes the data into cpu_endianness format
and does formatting of data to device format before
sending to device.
The transfer can be completed in single transfer or multiple
transfer based on data formatting.
