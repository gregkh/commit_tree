x86: kvmclock: abstract save/restore sched_clock_state

Upon resume from hibernation, CPU 0's hvclock area contains the old
values for system_time and tsc_timestamp. It is necessary for the
hypervisor to update these values with uptodate ones before the CPU uses
them.

Abstract TSC's save/restore sched_clock_state functions and use
restore_state to write to KVM_SYSTEM_TIME MSR, forcing an update.

Also move restore_sched_clock_state before __restore_processor_state,
since the later calls CONFIG_LOCK_STAT's lockstat_clock (also for TSC).
Thanks to Igor Mammedov for tracking it down.

Fixes suspend-to-disk with kvmclock.
