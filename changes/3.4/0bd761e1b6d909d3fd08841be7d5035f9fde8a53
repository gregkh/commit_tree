irq_domain/c6x: Convert c6x to use generic irq_domain support.

The C6X IRQ support was copied almost verbatim from the PowerPC virtual IRQ
code. The PowerPC code was used as the basis for generic irq_domain support,
so this patch mostly copies what what done to arch/powerpc by Grant Likely
in his irq_domain patch series.
