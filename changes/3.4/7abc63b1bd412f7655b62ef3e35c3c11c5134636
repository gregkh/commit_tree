sched/rt: Do not throttle when PI boosting

When a runqueue has rt_runtime_us = 0 then the only way it can
accumulate rt_time is via PI boosting. That causes the runqueue
to be throttled and replenishing does not change anything due to
rt_runtime_us = 0. So avoid that situation by clearing rt_time and
skip the throttling alltogether.
