drop_monitor: Make updating data->skb smp safe

Eric Dumazet pointed out to me that the drop_monitor protocol has some holes in
its smp protections.  Specifically, its possible to replace data->skb while its
being written.  This patch corrects that by making data->skb an rcu protected
variable.  That will prevent it from being overwritten while a tracepoint is
modifying it.
