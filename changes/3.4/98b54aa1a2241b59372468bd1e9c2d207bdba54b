kgdb,debug_core: pass the breakpoint struct instead of address and memory

There is extra state information that needs to be exposed in the
kgdb_bpt structure for tracking how a breakpoint was installed.  The
debug_core only uses the the probe_kernel_write() to install
breakpoints, but this is not enough for all the archs.  Some arch such
as x86 need to use text_poke() in order to install a breakpoint into a
read only page.

Passing the kgdb_bpt structure to kgdb_arch_set_breakpoint() and
kgdb_arch_remove_breakpoint() allows other archs to set the type
variable which indicates how the breakpoint was installed.
