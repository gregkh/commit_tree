Btrfs: fix regression in scrub path resolving

In commit 4692cf58 we introduced new backref walking code for btrfs. This
assumes we're searching live roots, which requires a transaction context.
While scrubbing, however, we must not join a transaction because this could
deadlock with the commit path. Additionally, what scrub really wants to do
is resolving a logical address in the commit root it's currently checking.

This patch adds support for logical to path resolving on commit roots and
makes scrub use that.
