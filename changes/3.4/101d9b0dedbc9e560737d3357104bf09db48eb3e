ARM: use set_current_blocked() and block_sigmask()

As described in e6fa16ab ("signal: sigprocmask() should do
retarget_shared_pending()") the modification of current->blocked is
incorrect as we need to check for shared signals we're about to block.

Also, use the new helper function introduced in commit 5e6292c0f28f
("signal: add block_sigmask() for adding sigmask to current->blocked")
which centralises the code for updating current->blocked after
successfully delivering a signal and reduces the amount of duplicate code
across architectures.  In the past some architectures got this code wrong,
so using this helper function should stop that from happening again.
