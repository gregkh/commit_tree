[media] s5p-jpeg: Adapt to new controls

Adapt to new controls (subsampling).

For encoding, the destination format now needs to be set to V4L2_PIX_FMT_JPEG
and the subsampling (4:2:2 or 4:2:0) needs to be set using the respective
control (V4L2_CID_JPEG_CHROMA_SUBSAMPLING). Required buffer size for
destination image during encoding is no longer deduced from the format (which
generally implied overestimation), but needs to be given from userspace in
sizeimage.

Not strictly related to the added controls, this patch also fixes setting the
subsampling of the destination image for decoding, depending on the destination
format.
