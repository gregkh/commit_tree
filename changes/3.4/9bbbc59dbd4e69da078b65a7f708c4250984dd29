tipc: Optimize setting of immutable payload message header fields

Optimizes routines that send payload messages so that they no longer
update the "originating node" and "originating port" fields of the
outgoing message header template, since these fields are initialized
when the sending port is created and never change thereafter. Also
optimizes the routine which updates the message header template when
a connection to a port is established, for the same reason.
