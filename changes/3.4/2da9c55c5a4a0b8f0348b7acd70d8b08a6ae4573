Bluetooth: mgmt: Bump mgmt version

This patch bumps the mgmt version to 1 and resets the revision to 0.
This is in order to indicate API stability to user space. The mgmt API
has reached a point where no major backwards incompatible changes are
expected so it makes sense to do this version bump now.
