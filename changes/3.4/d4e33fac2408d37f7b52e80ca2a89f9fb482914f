serial: Kill off NO_IRQ

We transform the offenders into a test of irq <= 0 which will be ok while
the ARM people get their platform sorted. Once that is done (or in a while
if they don't do it anyway) then we will change them all to !irq checks.

For arch specific drivers that are already using NO_IRQ = 0 we just test
against zero so we don't need to re-review them later.
