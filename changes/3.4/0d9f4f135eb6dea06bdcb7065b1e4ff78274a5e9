MD: Add del_timer_sync to mddev_suspend (fix nasty panic)

Use del_timer_sync to remove timer before mddev_suspend finishes.

We don't want a timer going off after an mddev_suspend is called.  This is
especially true with device-mapper, since it can call the destructor function
immediately following a suspend.  This results in the removal (kfree) of the
structures upon which the timer depends - resulting in a very ugly panic.
Therefore, we add a del_timer_sync to mddev_suspend to prevent this.
