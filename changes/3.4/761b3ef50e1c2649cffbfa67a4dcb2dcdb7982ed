cgroup: remove cgroup_subsys argument from callbacks

The argument is not used at all, and it's not necessary, because
a specific callback handler of course knows which subsys it
belongs to.

Now only ->pupulate() takes this argument, because the handlers of
this callback always call cgroup_add_file()/cgroup_add_files().

So we reduce a few lines of code, though the shrinking of object size
is minimal.
