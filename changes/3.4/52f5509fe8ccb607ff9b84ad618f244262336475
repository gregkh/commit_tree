e1000: fix vlan processing regression

This patch fixes a regression introduced by commit "e1000: do vlan
cleanup (799d531)".

Apparently some e1000 chips (not mine) are sensitive about the order of
setting vlan filter and vlan stripping/inserting functionality. So this
patch changes the order so it's the same as before vlan cleanup.
