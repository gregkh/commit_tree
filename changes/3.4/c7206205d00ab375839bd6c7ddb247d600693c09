perf: Fix mmap_page capabilities and docs

Complete the syscall-less self-profiling feature and address
all complaints, namely:

 - capabilities, so we can detect what is actually available at runtime

     Add a capabilities field to perf_event_mmap_page to indicate
     what is actually available for use.

 - on x86: RDPMC weirdness due to being 40/48 bits and not sign-extending
   properly.

 - ABI documentation as to how all this stuff works.

Also improve the documentation for the new features.
