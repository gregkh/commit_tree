drm/i915: Separate fence pin counting from normal bind pin counting

In order to correctly account for reserving space in the GTT and fences
for a batch buffer, we need to independently track whether the fence is
pinned due to a fenced GPU access in the batch or whether the buffer is
pinned in the aperture. Currently we count the fenced as pinned if the
buffer has already been seen in the execbuffer. This leads to a false
accounting of available fence registers, causing frequent mass evictions.
Worse, if coupled with the change to make i915_gem_object_get_fence()
report EDADLK upon fence starvation, the batchbuffer can fail with only
one fence required...

Fixes intel-gpu-tools/tests/gem_fenced_exec_thrash
