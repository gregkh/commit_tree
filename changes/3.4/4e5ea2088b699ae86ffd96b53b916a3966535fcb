iwlegacy: cleanup/fix memory barriers

wmb(), rmb() are not needed when writel(), readl() are used as
accessors for MMIO. We use them indirectly via iowrite32(),
ioread32().

What is needed mmiowb(), for synchronizing writes coming from
different CPUs on PCIe bridge (see in patch comments). This
fortunately is not needed on x86, where mmiowb() is just
defined as compiler barrier. As iwlegacy devices are most likely
not used on anything other than x86, this is not so important
fix.
