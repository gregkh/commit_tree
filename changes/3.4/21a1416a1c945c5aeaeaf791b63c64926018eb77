KVM: lock slots_lock around device assignment

As pointed out by Jason Baron, when assigning a device to a guest
we first set the iommu domain pointer, which enables mapping
and unmapping of memory slots to the iommu.  This leaves a window
where this path is enabled, but we haven't synchronized the iommu
mappings to the existing memory slots.  Thus a slot being removed
at that point could send us down unexpected code paths removing
non-existent pinnings and iommu mappings.  Take the slots_lock
around creating the iommu domain and initial mappings as well as
around iommu teardown to avoid this race.
