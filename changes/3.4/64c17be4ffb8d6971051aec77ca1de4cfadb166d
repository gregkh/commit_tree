perf annotate: Fix off by one symbol hist size allocation and hit accounting

We were not noticing it because symbol__inc_addr_samples was erroneously
dropping samples that hit the last byte in a function.

Working on a fix for a problem reported by David Miller, Stephane
Eranian and Sorin Dumitru, where addresses < sym->start were causing
problems, I noticed this other problem.
