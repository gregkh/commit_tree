staging: zsmalloc: zsmalloc memory allocation library

This patch creates a new memory allocation library named
zsmalloc.

NOTE: zsmalloc currently depends on SPARSEMEM for the MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS
value needed to determine the format of the object handle. There may
be a better way to do this.  Feedback is welcome.
