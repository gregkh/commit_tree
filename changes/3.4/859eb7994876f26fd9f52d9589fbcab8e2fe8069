libceph: encapsulate connection kvec operations

Encapsulate the operation of adding a new chunk of data to the next
open slot in a ceph_connection's out_kvec array.  Also add a "reset"
operation to make subsequent add operations start at the beginning
of the array again.

Use these routines throughout, avoiding duplicate code and ensuring
all calls are handled consistently.
