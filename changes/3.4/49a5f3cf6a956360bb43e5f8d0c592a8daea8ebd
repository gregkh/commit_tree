TTY: pdc_cons, fix regression in close

The test in pdc_console_tty_close '!tty->count' was always wrong
because tty->count is decremented after tty->ops->close is called and
thus can never be zero. Hence the 'then' branch was never executed and
the timer never deleted.

This did not matter until commit 5dd5bc40f3b6 ("TTY: pdc_cons, use
tty_port").  There we needed to set TTY in tty_port to NULL, but this
never happened due to the bug above.

So change the test to really trigger at the last close by changing the
condition to 'tty->count == 1'.

Well, the driver should not touch tty->count at all.  It should use
tty_port->count and count open count there itself.
