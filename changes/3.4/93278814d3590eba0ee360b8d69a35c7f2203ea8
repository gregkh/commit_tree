mm: fix division by 0 in percpu_pagelist_fraction()

percpu_pagelist_fraction_sysctl_handler() has only considered -EINVAL as
a possible error from proc_dointvec_minmax().

If any other error is returned, it would proceed to divide by zero since
percpu_pagelist_fraction wasn't getting initialized at any point.  For
example, writing 0 bytes into the proc file would trigger the issue.
