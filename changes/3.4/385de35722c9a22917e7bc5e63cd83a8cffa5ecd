thp: allow a hwpoisoned head page to be put back to LRU

Andrea Arcangeli pointed out to me that a check in __memory_failure()
which was intended to prevent THP tail pages from being checked for the
absence of the PG_lru flag (something that is always the case), was also
preventing THP head pages from being checked.

A THP head page could actually benefit from the call to shake_page() by
ending up being put back to a LRU, provided it had been waiting in a
pagevec array.

Andrea suggested that the "!PageTransCompound(p)" in the if-statement
should be replaced by a "!PageTransTail(p)", thus allowing THP head pages
to be checked and possibly shaken.
