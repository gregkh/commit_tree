rbd: protect the rbd_dev_list with a spinlock

The rbd_dev_list is just a simple list of all the current
rbd_devices.  Using the ctl_mutex as a concurrency guard is
overkill.  Instead, use a spinlock for that specific purpose.

This also reduces the window that the ctl_mutex needs to be held in
rbd_add().
