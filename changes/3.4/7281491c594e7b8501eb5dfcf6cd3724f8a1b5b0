dynamic_debug: enlarge command/query write buffer

Current query write buffer is 256 bytes, on stack.  In comparison, the
ddebug_query boot-arg is 1024.  Allocate the buffer off heap, and
enlarge it to 4096 bytes, big enough for ~100 queries (at 40 bytes
each), and error out if not.  This makes it play nicely with large
query sets (to be added later).  The buffer should be enough for most
uses, and others should probably be split into subsets.
