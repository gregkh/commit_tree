rcu: Add lockdep-RCU checks for simple self-deadlock

It is illegal to have a grace period within a same-flavor RCU read-side
critical section, so this commit adds lockdep-RCU checks to splat when
such abuse is encountered.  This commit does not detect more elaborate
RCU deadlock situations.  These situations might be a job for lockdep
enhancements.
