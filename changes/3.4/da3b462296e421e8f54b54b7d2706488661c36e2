SUNRPC: release per-net clients lock before calling PipeFS dentries creation

v3:
1) Lookup for client is performed from the beginning of the list on each PipeFS
event handling operation.

Lockdep is sad otherwise, because inode mutex is taken on PipeFS dentry
creation, which can be called on mount notification, where this per-net client
lock is taken on clients list walk.
