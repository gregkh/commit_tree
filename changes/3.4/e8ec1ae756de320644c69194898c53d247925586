tipc: Eliminate obsolete code for re-sending a message

Removes code that updated the "previous node" field of an out-going
message over TIPC's links. Such updating is unnecessary since the
removal of the prototype multi-cluster capability means that all
outgoing messages are generated locally and already have this field
populated correctly.
