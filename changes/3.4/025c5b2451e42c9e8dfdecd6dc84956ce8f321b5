thp: optimize away unnecessary page table locking

Currently when we check if we can handle thp as it is or we need to split
it into regular sized pages, we hold page table lock prior to check
whether a given pmd is mapping thp or not.  Because of this, when it's not
"huge pmd" we suffer from unnecessary lock/unlock overhead.  To remove it,
this patch introduces a optimized check function and replace several
similar logics with it.
