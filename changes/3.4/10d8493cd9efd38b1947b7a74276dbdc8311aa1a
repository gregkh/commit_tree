bcma: add support for on-chip OTP memory used for SPROM storage

Wireless Broadcom chips can have either their SPROM data stored
on either external SPROM or on-chip OTP memory. Both are accessed
through the same register space. This patch adds support for the
on-chip OTP memory.

Tested with:
BCM43224 OTP and SPROM
BCM4331 SPROM
BCM4313 OTP

This patch is in response to linux-wireless thread [1].
