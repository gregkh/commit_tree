Revert "ALSA: hda - Set codec to D3 forcibly even if not used"

This reverts commit 785f857d1cb0856b612b46a0545b74aa2596e44a.

The commit causes a problem with the wrong D3 state after suspend
because the call of hda_set_power_state() involves with the power-up
sequence, which changes the power_count, and this confuses the resume
sequence that checks the power_count as well.

Originally, this go-to-D3 sequence should be a simple task without the
power-up sequence.  But, it'd need some proper sanity checks in the
case of power-saved state, so it's not too easy to write now in the
3.4-rc cycle.

In short, the safest option now is to revert this affecting commit.

Of course, we need to clean up and robustify the power-saving code
better for 3.5 kernel.
