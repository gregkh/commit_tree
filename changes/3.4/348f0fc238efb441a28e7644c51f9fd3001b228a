tracing: Fix regression with tracing_on

The change to make tracing_on affect only the ftrace ring buffer, caused
a bug where it wont affect any ring buffer. The problem was that the buffer
of the trace_array was passed to the write function and not the trace array
itself.

The trace_array can change the buffer when running a latency tracer. If this
happens, then the buffer being disabled may not be the buffer currently used
by ftrace. This will cause the tracing_on file to become useless.

The simple fix is to pass the trace_array to the write function instead of
the buffer. Then the actual buffer may be changed.
