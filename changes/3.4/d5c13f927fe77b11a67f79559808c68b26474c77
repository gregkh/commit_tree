btrfs: clean_tree_block should panic on observed memory corruption and return void

 The only error condition in clean_tree_block is an accounting bug.
 Returning without modifying dirty_metadata_bytes and as if the cleaning
 as been performed may cause problems later so it should panic instead.

 It should probably be a BUG_ON but we have btrfs_panic now.
