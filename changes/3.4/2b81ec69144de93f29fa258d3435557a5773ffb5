ASoC: fsl: check property 'compatible' for the machine name

Check /compatible rather than /model to determine the machine name.
The p1022ds older device trees get a different /model from the new
ones, while /compatible is consistent there, so checking /compatible
will save the bother of detecting older p1022ds device trees.
