mtd: add offset and length checks to the API function

Add verification of the offset and length to MTD API functions and verify that
MTD device offset and length are within MTD device size.

The modified API functions are:

'mtd_erase()'
'mtd_point()'
'mtd_unpoint()'
'mtd_get_unmapped_area()'
'mtd_read()'
'mtd_write()'
'mtd_panic_write()'
'mtd_lock()'
'mtd_unlock()'
'mtd_is_locked()'
'mtd_block_isbad()'
'mtd_block_markbad()'

This patch also uninlines these functions and exports in mtdcore.c because they
are not performance-critical and do not have to be inlined.
