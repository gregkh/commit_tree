x86/mrst/pci: v4l/atomisp: treat atomisp as real pci device

ATOMISP on Medfield is a real PCI device which should be handled differently
than the fake PCI devices on south complex. PCI type 1 access is used for
accessing config space this also has other impact such as PM D3 delay. There
shouldn't be any need for reading base address from IUNIT via msg bus.
