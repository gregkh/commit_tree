alpha: fix build failures from system.h dismemberment

commit ec2212088c42ff7d1362629ec26dda4f3e8bdad3

    "Disintegrate asm/system.h for Alpha"

combined with commit b4816afa3986704d1404fc48e931da5135820472

    "Move the asm-generic/system.h xchg() implementation to asm-generic/cmpxchg.h"

introduced the concept of asm/cmpxchg.h but the alpha arch
never got one.  Fork the cmpxchg content out of the asm/atomic.h
file to create one.

Some minor whitespace fixups were done on the block of code that
created the new file.
