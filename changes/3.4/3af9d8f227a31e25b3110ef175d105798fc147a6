cifs: fix offset handling in cifs_iovec_write

In the recent update of the cifs_iovec_write code to use async writes,
the handling of the file position was broken. That patch added a local
"offset" variable to handle the offset, and then only updated the
original "*poffset" before exiting.

Unfortunately, it copied off the original offset from the beginning,
instead of doing so after generic_write_checks had been called. Fix
this by moving the initialization of "offset" after that in the
function.
