[SCSI] libsas: poll for ata device readiness after reset

Use ata_wait_after_reset() to poll for link recovery after a reset.
This combined with sas_ha->eh_mutex prevents expander rediscovery from
probing phys in an intermediate state.  Local discovery does not have a
mechanism to filter link status changes during this timeout, so it
remains the responsibility of lldds to prevent premature port teardown.
Although once all lldd's support ->lldd_ata_check_ready() that could be
used as a gate to local port teardown.

The signature fis is re-transmitted when the link comes back so we
should be revalidating the ata device class, but that is left to a future
patch.
