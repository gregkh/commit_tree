mlx4: Enforce device max FMR maps in FMR alloc

ConnectX devices have a limit on the number of mappings that can be
done on an FMR before having to call sync_tpt.  The current
mlx4_ib driver reports the limit correctly in max_map_per_fmr in
.query_device(), but mlx4_core doesn't check it when actually
allocating FMRs.

Add a max_fmr_maps field to struct mlx4_caps and enforce this maximum
value on FMR allocations.
