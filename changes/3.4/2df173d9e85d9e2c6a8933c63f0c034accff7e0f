fadump: Initialize elfcore header and add PT_LOAD program headers.

Build the crash memory range list by traversing through system memory during
the first kernel before we register for firmware-assisted dump. After the
successful dump registration, initialize the elfcore header and populate
PT_LOAD program headers with crash memory ranges. The elfcore header is
saved in the scratch area within the reserved memory. The scratch area starts
at the end of the memory reserved for saving RMR region contents. The
scratch area contains fadump crash info structure that contains magic number
for fadump validation and physical address where the eflcore header can be
found. This structure will also be used to pass some important crash info
data to the second kernel which will help second kernel to populate ELF core
header with correct data before it gets exported through /proc/vmcore. Since
the firmware preserves the entire partition memory at the time of crash the
contents of the scratch area will be preserved till second kernel boot.

Since the memory dump exported through /proc/vmcore is in ELF format similar
to kdump, it will help us to reuse the kdump infrastructure for dump capture
and filtering. Unlike phyp dump, userspace tool does not need to refer any
sysfs interface while reading /proc/vmcore.

NOTE: The current design implementation does not address a possibility of
introducing additional fields (in future) to this structure without affecting
compatibility. It's on TODO list to come up with better approach to
address this.
