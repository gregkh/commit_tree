mwifiex: correct bitrates advertised to cfg80211

1. Driver and firmware do not support 22Mbps and 72Mbps bitrates.
Remove them from the rate table advertised to cfg80211.

2. First 4 rates from mwifiex_rates table are not valid for
5GHz/A band. Set correct bitrate array's index and no of rates for
ieee80211_supported_band for 5GHz band.
