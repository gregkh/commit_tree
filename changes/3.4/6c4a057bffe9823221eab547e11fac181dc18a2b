ARM: OMAP4: clock data: Force a DPLL clkdm/pwrdm ON before a relock

All DPLLs except USB are in ALWON powerdomain. Make sure the
clkdm/pwrdm for USB DPLL (l3init) is turned on before attempting
a DPLL relock. So, mark the database accordingly.

Without this fix, it was seen that DPLL relock fails while testing
relock in a loop of USB DPLL.
