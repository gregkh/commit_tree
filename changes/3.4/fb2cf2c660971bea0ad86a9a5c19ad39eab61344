sched: Fix OOPS when build_sched_domains() percpu allocation fails

Under extreme memory used up situations, percpu allocation
might fail. We hit it when system goes to suspend-to-ram,
causing a kworker panic:

 EIP: [<c124411a>] build_sched_domains+0x23a/0xad0
 Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception
 Pid: 3026, comm: kworker/u:3
 3.0.8-137473-gf42fbef #1

 Call Trace:
  [<c18cc4f2>] panic+0x66/0x16c
  [...]
  [<c1244c37>] partition_sched_domains+0x287/0x4b0
  [<c12a77be>] cpuset_update_active_cpus+0x1fe/0x210
  [<c123712d>] cpuset_cpu_inactive+0x1d/0x30
  [...]

With this fix applied build_sched_domains() will return -ENOMEM and
the suspend attempt fails.

[ So, we fail to deallocate a CPU because we cannot allocate RAM :-/
  I don't like that kind of sad behavior but nevertheless it should
  not crash under high memory load. ]
