irq_domain: Remove irq_domain_add_simple()

irq_domain_add_simple() was a stop-gap measure until complete irq_domain
support was complete.  This patch removes the irq_domain_add_simple()
interface.

This patch also drops the explicit irq_domain initialization performed
by the mach-versatile code because the versatile interrupt controller
already has irq_domain support built into it.  This was a bug that was
hanging around quietly for a while, but with the full irq_domain which
actually verifies that irq_domain ranges are available it would cause
the registration to fail and the system wouldn't boot.

v4: Fixed number of irqs in mx5 gpio code
v2: Updated to pass in host_data pointer on irq_domain allocation.
