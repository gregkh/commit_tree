ep93xx: Use ioremap for backlight driver

The ep93xx backlight driver uses a single register within the
framebuffer's register space. Currently the backlight driver uses a
static IO mapping for the register since the memory cannot be
requested by both drivers.

Convert the static mapping to use ioremap so that we can remove the
dependency on mach/hardware.h. To do so, we need remove the
request_mem_region from both the backlight and framebuffer drivers,
since whichever driver is loaded second will fail with -EBUSY
otherwise.

A proper fix is still required, and a FIXME comment has been added to
both drivers.
