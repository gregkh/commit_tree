regulator: Add a pointer to aat2870_data in struct aat2870_regulator

The reason we add *pdev in struct aat2870_regulator is to use it
to get a pointer to struct aat2870_data.
Save a pointer to struct aat2870_data instead of pdev in struct
aat2870_regulator, this change makes the intention more clear.
