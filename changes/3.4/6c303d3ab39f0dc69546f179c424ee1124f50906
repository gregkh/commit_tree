tracing: let trace_signal_generate() report more info, kill overflow_fail/lose_info

__send_signal()->trace_signal_generate() doesn't report enough info.
The users want to know was the signal actually delivered or not, and
they also need the shared/private info.

The patch moves trace_signal_generate() at the end of __send_signal()
and adds the 2 additional arguments.

This also allows us to kill trace_signal_overflow_fail/lose_info, we
can simply add the appropriate TRACE_SIGNAL_ "result" codes.
