PM / Runtime: don't forget to wake up waitqueue on failure

This patch (as1535) fixes a bug in the runtime PM core.  When a
runtime suspend attempt completes, whether successfully or not, the
device's power.wait_queue is supposed to be signalled.  But this
doesn't happen in the failure pathway of rpm_suspend() when another
autosuspend attempt is rescheduled.  As a result, a task can get stuck
indefinitely on the wait queue (I have seen this happen in testing).

The patch fixes the problem by moving the wake_up_all() call up near
the start of the failure code.
