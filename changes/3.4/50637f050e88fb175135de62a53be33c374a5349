staging: ramster: unbreak my heart

The just-merged ramster staging driver was dependent on a cleanup patch in
cleancache, so was marked CONFIG_BROKEN until that patch could be
merged.  That cleancache patch is now merged (and the correct SHA of the
cleancache patch is 3167760f83899ccda312b9ad9306ec9e5dda06d4 rather than
the one shown in the comment removed in the patch below).

So remove the CONFIG_BROKEN now and the comment that is no longer true...
