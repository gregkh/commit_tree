MFD: mcp-sa11x0: add .owner initializer

Patch partly taken from af9081ae64 (ARM: sa1100: Refactor mcp-sa11x0 to
use platform resources.) by Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>

Move the MODULE_ALIAS() alongside the other MODULE_* definitions, and
use DRIVER_NAME to ensure that the driver is consistently named.
