ARM: 7316/1: kexec: EOI active and mask all interrupts in kexec crash path

The kexec machine crash code can be called in interrupt context via a
sysrq trigger made using the magic key combination. If the irq chip
dealing with the serial interrupt is using the fasteoi flow handler,
then we will never EOI the interrupt because the interrupt handler will
be fatal. In the case of a GIC, this results in the crash kernel not
receiving interrupts on that CPU interface.

This patch adds code (based on the PowerPC implementation) to EOI any
pending interrupts on the crash CPU before masking and disabling all
interrupts. Secondary cores are not a problem since they are placed into
a cpu_relax() loop via an IPI.
