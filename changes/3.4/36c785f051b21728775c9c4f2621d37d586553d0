drm/i915: merge struct intel_gpio into struct intel_gmbus

When we set up the gpio fallback, we always have a 1:1 relationship
with an intel_gmbus. Exploit that to store all gpio related data in
there, too. This is a preparation step to merge the tw i2c adapters
controlling the same bus into one.

Just mundane code-munging in this patch.
