rtc: Expire alarms after the time is set. (v2)

If the alarm time programming in the rtc is ever in the past, it won't fire,
and any other alarm will be queued after it so they won't fire either.

So any time that the alarm might be in the past, we need to trigger
the irq handler to ensure the old alarm is cleared and the timer queue
is fully in the future.

This is done whenever the RTC clock is set.

This is the second revision of this patch, which was earlier reverted.
This version avoids the initialization problem, which is handled by
a different patch.
