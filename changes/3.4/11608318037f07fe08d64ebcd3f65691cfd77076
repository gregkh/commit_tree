xen/pciback: Support pci_reset_function, aka FLR or D3 support.

We use the __pci_reset_function_locked to perform the action.
Also on attaching ("bind") and detaching ("unbind") we save and
restore the configuration states. When the device is disconnected
from a guest we use the "pci_reset_function" to also reset the
device before being passed to another guest.
