ALSA: workaround: change the timing of alsa_sound_last_init()

Current alsa_sound_last_init() was called as __initcall().
So, on current ALSA, only devices that had been properly
registered at this point were shown.
So, it will show "No soundcards found" if driver requests
probe deferment. it's often misleading.
This patch delays the timing of alsa_sound_last_init()
as workaround.
