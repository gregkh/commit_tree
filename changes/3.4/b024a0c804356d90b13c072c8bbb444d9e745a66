ARM: ux500: move top level platform devices in sysfs to /sys/devices/socX

At the request of Arnd Bergmann this patch moves all SoC
platform devices found in sysfs from /sys/devices/platform to
/sys/devices/soc<SoCNum>/. It is believed as the devices are
SoC specific and a /sys/devices/soc node has recently
become available, that this would be a more appropriate place to
display the data.
