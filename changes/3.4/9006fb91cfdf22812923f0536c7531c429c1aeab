xfs: split and cleanup xfs_log_reserve

Split the log regrant case out of xfs_log_reserve into a separate function,
and merge xlog_grant_log_space and xlog_regrant_write_log_space into their
respective callers.  Also replace the XFS_LOG_PERM_RESERV flag, which easily
got misused before the previous cleanups with a simple boolean parameter.
