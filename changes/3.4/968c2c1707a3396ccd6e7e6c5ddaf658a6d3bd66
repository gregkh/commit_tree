regulator: Actually free the regulator in devm_regulator_put()

It turns out that (quite surprisingly) devres_destroy() only undoes the
devres mapping, it doesn't destroy the underlying resource, meaning that
anything using devm_regulator_put() would leak. While we wait for the new
devres_release() which does what we want to get merged open code it in
devm_regulator_put().
