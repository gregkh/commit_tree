[SCSI] fcoe: Rename out_nomod label to out_putmod

The label implies that it should be called when
there is 'nomod.' I read that to mean that the
module reference 'get' failed. However, it's only
called when the module reference 'get' succeeded.

I think it makes more sense to name the label,
'out_putmod' since it should be called when we
need to 'put' the module reference taken in the
routine before returning.
