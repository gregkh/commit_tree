ARM: ux500: export System-on-Chip information ux500 via sysfs

Here we make use of the new System-On-Chip bus driver to export
vital SoC information out to userspace via sysfs. This patch
provides a data structure of strings to populate the base
nodes found in:

/sys/devices/soc[0|1|2|...]/[family|machine|revision|soc_id].

It also adds one more node as requested by ST-Ericsson.
'process' depicts the way in which the silicon was manufactured.
