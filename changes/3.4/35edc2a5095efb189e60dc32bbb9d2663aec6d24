perf, arch: Rework perf_event_index()

Put the logic to compute the event index into a per pmu method. This
is required because the x86 rules are weird and wonderful and don't
match the capabilities of the current scheme.

AFAIK only powerpc actually has a usable userspace read of the PMCs
but I'm not at all sure anybody actually used that.

ARM is restored to the default since it currently does not support
userspace access at all. And all software events are provided with a
method that reports their index as 0 (disabled).
