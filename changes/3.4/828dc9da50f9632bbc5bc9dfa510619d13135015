ipmi: increase KCS timeouts

We currently time out and retry KCS transactions after 1 second of waiting
for IBF or OBF.  This appears to be too short for some hardware.  The IPMI
spec says "All system software wait loops should include error timeouts.
For simplicity, such timeouts are not shown explicitly in the flow
diagrams.  A five-second timeout or greater is recommended".  Change the
timeout to five seconds to satisfy the slow hardware.
