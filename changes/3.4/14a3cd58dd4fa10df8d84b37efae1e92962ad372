staging: ramster: ramster-specific new files

New files for ramster support:  The file ramster.h declares externs
and some pampd bitfield manipulation.  The file zcache.h declares
some zcache functions that now must be accessed from the ramster
glue code.  The file ramster_o2net.c is the glue between
zcache and the o2net messaging code, providing routines called
from zcache that initiate messages, and routines that handle
messages by calling zcache. TODO explains future plans for merging.
