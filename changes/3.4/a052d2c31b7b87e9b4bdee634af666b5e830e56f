sh: fix clock-sh7757 for the latest sh_mobile_sdhi driver

The commit 996bc8aebd2cd5b6d4c5d85085f171fa2447f364 (mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi:
do not manage PM clocks manually) modified the sh_mobile_sdhi driver to
remove the clk_enable/clk_disable. So, we need to change
the "CLKDEV_CON_ID" to "CLKDEV_DEV_ID".

If we don't change this, we will see the following error from the driver:
    sh_mobile_sdhi sh_mobile_sdhi.0: timeout waiting for hardware interrupt (CMD52)
