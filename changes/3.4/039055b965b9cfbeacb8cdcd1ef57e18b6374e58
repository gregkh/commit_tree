qeth: add wake_up on write channel

To send commands on the write channel 8 buffers exist. If all
8 buffers are used, a wait is triggered on the write channel. When
such buffer are freed, a wake_up is needed. This patch adds the
missing wake_up in qeth_release_buffer().
This fix is especially important when running Communications
Controller for Linux on System z.
