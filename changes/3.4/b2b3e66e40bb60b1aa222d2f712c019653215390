pinctrl: Store mapping table as a list of chunks

Instead of storing a single array of mapping table entries, which
requires realloc()ing that array each time it's extended and copying
the new data, simply store a list of pointers to the individual chunks.
This also removes the need to copy the mapping table at all; a pointer
is maintained to the original table, this saving memory.

A macro for_each_maps() is introduced to hide the additional complexity
of iterating over the map entries.

This change will also simplify removing chunks of entries from the mapping
table. This isn't important right now, but will be in the future, when
mapping table entries are dynamically added when parsing them from the
device tree, and removed when drivers no longer need to interact with
pinctrl.
