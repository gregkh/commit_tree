bcma: add support for sprom not found on the device

On SoCs the sprom is stored in the nvram in a special partition on the
flash chip. The nvram contains the sprom for the main bus, but
sometimes also for a pci devices using bcma. This patch makes it
possible for the arch code to register a function to fetch the needed
sprom from the nvram and provide it to the bcma code.
