ARM: tegra: support for secondary cores on Tegra30

Add support for bringing up secondary cores on Tegra30. On Tegra30 secondary
CPU cores are powergated, so we need to turn on the domains before we can bring
the CPU cores online. Bringing secondary cores online happens early during the
sytem boot, so we call powergating initialization from platform early_init
function.
