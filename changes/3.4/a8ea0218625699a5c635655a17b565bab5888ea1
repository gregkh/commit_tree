[media] it913x v1.23 use it913x_config.chip_ver to select firmware

As recommended by Jason at ITE, the chip version should select firmware.

However, to continue to support IT9137 firmware with different configuration
the driver will use udev->descriptor.idVendor to select the difference
between IT9135 and IT9137.
