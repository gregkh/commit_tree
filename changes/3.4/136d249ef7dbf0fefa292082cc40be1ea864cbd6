x86/ioapic: Add io_apic_ops driver layer to allow interception

Xen dom0 needs to paravirtualize IO operations to the IO APIC,
so add a io_apic_ops for it to intercept.  Do this as ops
structure because there's at least some chance that another
paravirtualized environment may want to intercept these.
