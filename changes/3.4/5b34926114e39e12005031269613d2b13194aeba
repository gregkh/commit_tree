tracing: Don't use p->len field to determine output in __print_*() functions

If more than one __print_*() function is used in a tracepoint
(__print_flags(), __print_symbols(), etc), then the temp seq buffer will
not be zero on entry. Using the temp seq buffer's length to know if
data has been printed or not in the current function is incorrect and
may produce incorrect results.

Currently, no in-tree tracepoint causes this bug, but new ones may
be created.
