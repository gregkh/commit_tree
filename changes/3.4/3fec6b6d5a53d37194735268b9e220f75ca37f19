ASoC: set idle_bias_off=1 for all platform DAPM contexts

The ASoC core currently defaults to using STANDBY rather than OFF for
idle ASoC platform devices, which causes a permanent pm_runtime_get() on
them. This keeps the device active unnecessarily. This can be especially
problematic when the ASoC platform device and DAI device are the same
device.

The distinction between OFF and STANDBY is likely not relevant for ASoC
platform drivers, since they aren't analog devices. So, solve this issue
by hard-coding idle_bias_off = 1 for all ASoC platform devices. If this
turns out to be a problem, this value could be sourced from the
snd_soc_platform_driver, similarly to soc_probe_codec().

Note: Prior to this change, this caused a large (10) runtime_active count
for the Tegra I2S controller even when not in use, and a leak in that
value as streams were started and stopped. This change probably hides a
bug.
