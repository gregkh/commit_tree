crypto: pcrypt - Use the online cpumask as the default

We use the active cpumask to determine the superset of cpus
to use for parallelization. However, the active cpumask is
for internal usage of the scheduler and therefore not the
appropriate cpumask for these purposes. So use the online
cpumask instead.
