ALSA: hda/realtek - Replace ALC260 model=replacer with the auto-parser

The support for Replacer 627V in the auto-parser needs the unique unsol
event handling: although the machine has a single output pin 0x0f, it's
used for both the headphone and the speaker, and the driver needs to
toggle the output route via GPIO 1.

In addition, it needs a special COEF setup with 0x3050.
