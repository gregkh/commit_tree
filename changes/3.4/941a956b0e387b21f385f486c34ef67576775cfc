hwmon: (fam15h_power) Increase output resolution

On high CPU load the accumulating values in the running_avg_cap
register are very low (below 10), so averaging them too early leads
to unnecessary poor output resolution. Since we pretend to output
micro-Watt we better keep all the bits we have as long as possible.
