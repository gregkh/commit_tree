usb: cdc-wdm: adding usb_cdc_wdm_register subdriver support

This driver can be used as a subdriver of another USB driver, allowing
it to export a Device Managment interface consisting of a single interrupt
endpoint with no dedicated USB interface.

Some devices provide a Device Management function combined with a wwan
function in a single USB interface having three endpoints (bulk in/out
+ interrupt).  If the interrupt endpoint is used exclusively for DM
notifications, then this driver can support that as a subdriver
provided that the wwan driver calls the appropriate entry points on
probe, suspend, resume, pre_reset, post_reset and disconnect.

The main driver must have full control over all interface related
settings, including the needs_remote_wakeup flag. A manage_power
function must be provided by the main driver.

A manage_power stub doing direct flag manipulation is used in normal
driver mode.
