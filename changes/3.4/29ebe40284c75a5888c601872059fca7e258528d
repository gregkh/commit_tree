ALSA: hda/realtek - Add quirk for Mac Pro 5,1 machines

A user reported that setting model=imac24 used to allow sound to work on their
Mac Pro 5,1 machine.  Commit 5671087ffa "Move ALC885 macpro and imac24 models
to auto-parser" removed this model option.  All Mac machines are now explicitly
handled with a quirk and the auto-parser.  This adds a quirk for the device
found on the Mac Pro 5,1 machines.

This (partially) fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=808559
