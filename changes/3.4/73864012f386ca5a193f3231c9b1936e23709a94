firewire: ohci: simplify iso header pointer arithmetic

When storing the header data of completed iso packets, we effectively
treat the buffers as arrays of quadlets.  Actually declaring the
pointers as u32* avoids repetitive pointer arithmetic, removes the
unhelpfully named "i" variables, and thus makes the code clearer.
