fs: Remove missed ->fds_bits from cessation use of fd_set structs internally

Stephen Rothwell reported that the following commit broke the
linux-next build:

  1fd36adcd98c: Replace the fd_sets in struct fdtable with an array of unsigned longs

Fix places where ->fds_bits needed to be removed as the core
kernel no longer uses fd_set internally for file descriptor
table management.  There are two places:

 (1) drivers/staging/android/binder.c

 (2) arch/mips/kernel/kspd.c

     Question: Should sp_cleanup() in the MIPS arch be using find_next_bit()
     or fls()?
