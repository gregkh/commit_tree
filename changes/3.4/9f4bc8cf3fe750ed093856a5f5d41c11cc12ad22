staging: r8712u: Fix regression introduced by commit a5ee652

In commit a5ee652 "staging: r8712u: Interface-state not fully tracked",
the private boolean "bup" was set false when the interface was brought down,
as that seemed appropriate. This change has not caused any problems when
using NetworkManager or manual control of the device; however, when wicd
control is used, there is a locking problem in wpa_supplicant, as shown in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42818.

This fix reverts the only code change in commit a5ee652. My
analysis is that "bup" is badly named. In its present form, it
seems to indicate the up/down state of the device, but its usage
is more consistent with an initialized/uninitialized state. That
problem will be addressed in a later patch.

Note: Commit 8c213fa, which introdued asynchronous firmware loading
for this driver, exposed this bug to a greater extent. That bug
is addressed in the next patch in this series.

This bug is also responsible for the bug in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42815. and this bug is
also part of the problems discussed at https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/27996#comment89950.
