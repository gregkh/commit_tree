[SCSI] libsas: async ata scanning

libsas ata error handling is already async but this does not help the
scan case.  Move initial link recovery out from under host->scan_mutex,
and delay synchronization with eh until after all port probe/recovery
work has been queued.

Device ordering is maintained with scan order by still calling
sas_rphy_add() in order of domain discovery.

Since we now scan the domain list when invoking libata-eh we need to be
careful to check for fully initialized ata ports.
