sysfs: Kill nlink counting.

Tracking the number of subdirectories requires an extra field that increases
the size of sysfs_dirent.  nlinks are not particularly interesting for sysfs
and the nlink counts are wrong when network namespaces are involved so stop
counting them, and always return nlink == 1.  Userspace already knows that
directories with nlink == 1 have an nlink count they can't use to count
subdirectories.

This reduces the size of sysfs_dirent by 8 bytes on 64bit platforms.
