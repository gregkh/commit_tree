hwmon: (w83793) Fix checkpatch issues

Fixed:
ERROR: code indent should use tabs where possible
ERROR: do not use assignment in if condition
ERROR: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
WARNING: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
WARNING: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
WARNING: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
WARNING: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead

Modify multi-line comments to follow Documentation/CodingStyle.

Also replaced "<constant> == <variable>" with "<variable> == <constant>".
Translation was done with the following coccinelle script to limit risk.

@@
identifier i;
constant C;
@@

<...
- C == i
+ i == C
...>

Not fixed (false positive):
ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parenthesis
