module: add kernel param to force disable module load

Sometimes we need to test a kernel of same version with code or config
option changes.

We already have sysctl to disable module load, but add a kernel
parameter will be more convenient.

Since modules_disabled is int, so here use bint type in core_param.
TODO: make sysctl accept bool and change modules_disabled to bool
