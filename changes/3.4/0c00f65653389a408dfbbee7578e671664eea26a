powerpc/85xx: p2020rdb - move the NAND address.

It is not at 0xffa00000. According to current u-boot source the NAND
controller is always at 0xff800000 and it is either at CS0 or CS1
depending on NAND or NAND+NOR mode. In 36bit mode it is shifted to
0xfff800000 but it has always an eight there and never an A.
