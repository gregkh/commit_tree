mpc5200b/uart: select more tolerant uart prescaler on low baudrates

In addition to the /32 prescaler, the MPC5200B supports a second
baudrate prescaler /4 to reach higher baudrates.

The current calculation (introduced with commit 0d1f22e4) in the kernel
preferes this low prescaler as often as possible, but with some
imprecise counterparts the communication on low baudrates fails.

According a support-mail from freescale the low prescaler (/4) allows
just 1% tolerance in bittiming in contrast to 4% of the high prescaler
(/32).  The prescaler not only affects the baudrate-calculation, but
also the sampling of the bits on the wire.

With this patch, we use the slightly less precise, but higher tolerant
prescaler calculation on low baudrates up to (and including) 115200 baud
and the more precise calculation above.

Tested on a custom MPC5200B board with "fsl,mpc5200b-psc-uart".

Calculation Examples with prescaler (PS) 4 and 32 and divisor (DIV) on
various baudrates. Real stands for the real baudrate generated and Diff
for the differences between:
