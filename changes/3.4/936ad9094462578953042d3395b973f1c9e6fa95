cifs - check S_AUTOMOUNT in revalidate

When revalidating a dentry, if the inode wasn't known to be a dfs
entry when the dentry was instantiated, such as when created via
->readdir(), the DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT flag needs to be set on the
dentry in ->d_revalidate().

The false return from cifs_d_revalidate(), due to the inode now
being marked with the S_AUTOMOUNT flag, might not invalidate the
dentry if there is a concurrent unlazy path walk. This is because
the dentry reference count will be at least 2 in this case causing
d_invalidate() to return EBUSY. So the asumption that the dentry
will be discarded then correctly instantiated via ->lookup() might
not hold.
