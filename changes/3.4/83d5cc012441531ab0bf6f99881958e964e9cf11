mac80211: station state transition error handling

In the future, when we start notifying drivers,
state transitions could potentially fail. To make
it easier to distinguish between programming bugs
and driver failures:
 * rename sta_info_move_state() to
   sta_info_pre_move_state() which can only be
   called before the station is inserted (and
   check this with a new station flag).
 * rename sta_info_move_state_checked() to just
   plain sta_info_move_state(), as it will be
   the regular function that can fail for more
   than just one reason (bad transition or an
   error from the driver)

This makes the programming model easier -- one of
the functions can only be called before insertion
and can't fail, the other can fail.
