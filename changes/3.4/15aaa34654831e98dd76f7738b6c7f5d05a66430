tools turbostat: harden against cpu online/offline

Sometimes users have turbostat running in interval mode
when they take processors offline/online.

Previously, turbostat would survive, but not gracefully.

Tighten up the error checking so turbostat notices
changesn sooner, and print just 1 line on change:

turbostat: re-initialized with num_cpus %d
