dmaengine: at_hdmac: remove clear-on-read in atc_dostart()

This loop on EBCISR register was designed to clear IRQ sources before enabling
a DMA channel. This register is clear-on-read so a race condition can appear if
another channel is already active and has just finished its transfer.
Removing this read on EBCISR is fixing the issue as there is no case where an IRQ
could be pending: we already make sure that this register is drained at probe()
time and during resume.
