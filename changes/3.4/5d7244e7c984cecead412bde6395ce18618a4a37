x86-64: Fix memset() to support sizes of 4Gb and above

While currently there doesn't appear to be any reachable in-tree
case where such large memory blocks may be passed to memset()
(alloc_bootmem() being the primary non-reachable one, as it gets
called with suitably large sizes in FLATMEM configurations), we
have recently hit the problem a second time in our Xen kernels.

Rather than working around it a second time, prevent others from
falling into the same trap by fixing this long standing
limitation.
