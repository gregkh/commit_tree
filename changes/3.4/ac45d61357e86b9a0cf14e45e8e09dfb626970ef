fuse: fix nlink after unlink

Anand Avati reports that the following sequence of system calls fail on a fuse
filesystem:


 	create("filename") => 0
 	link("filename", "linkname") => 0
 	unlink("filename") => 0
 	link("linkname", "filename") => -ENOENT ### BUG ###

vfs_link() fails with ENOENT if i_nlink is zero, this is done to prevent
resurrecting already deleted files.

Fuse clears i_nlink on unlink even if there are other links pointing to the
file.
