ASoC: core: Add support for masking out parts of coefficient blocks

Chip designers frequently include things like the enable and disable
controls for algorithms in the register blocks which also hold the
coefficients. Since it's desirable to split out the enable/disable
control from userspace the plain SND_SOC_BYTES() isn't optimal for
these devices.

Add a SND_SOC_BYTES_MASK() which allows a bitmask from the first word
of the block to be excluded from the control. This supports the needs
of devices I've looked at and lets us have a reasonably simple API.
Further controls can be added in future if that's needed.
