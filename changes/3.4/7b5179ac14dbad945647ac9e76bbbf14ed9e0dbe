PM / Hibernate: Disable usermode helpers right before freezing tasks

There is no reason to call usermodehelper_disable() before creating
memory bitmaps in hibernate() and software_resume(), so call it right
before freeze_processes(), in accordance with the other suspend and
hibernation code.  Consequently, call usermodehelper_enable() right
after the thawing of tasks rather than after freeing the memory
bitmaps.
