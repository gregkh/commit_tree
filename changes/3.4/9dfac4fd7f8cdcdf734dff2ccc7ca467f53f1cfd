pinctrl: delete raw device pointers in pinmux maps

After discussion with Mark Brown in an unrelated thread about
ADC lookups, it came to my knowledge that the ability to pass
a struct device * in the regulator consumers is just a
historical artifact, and not really recommended. Since there
are no in-kernel users of these pointers, we just kill them
right now, before someone starts to use them.
