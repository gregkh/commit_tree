jbd2: cleanup journal tail after transaction commit

Normally, we have to issue a cache flush before we can update journal tail in
journal superblock, effectively wiping out old transactions from the journal.
So use the fact that during transaction commit we issue cache flush anyway and
opportunistically push journal tail as far as we can. Since update of journal
superblock is still costly (we have to use WRITE_FUA), we update log tail only
if we can free significant amount of space.
