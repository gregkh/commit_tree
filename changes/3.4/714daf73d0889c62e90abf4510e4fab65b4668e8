ARM: LPC32xx: clock.c: Fix lpc-eth clock reference

During a complex merge for v3.4, one line of the commit
c20b909be9ba27173294a52d08cab293ec030a2c ("ARM: LPC32xx: Ethernet support") was
reverted wrongly ("lpc-eth.0" -> "lpc-net.0") while the other conflicts were
merged correctly. This patch re-applies the clock name "lpc-eth.0".
