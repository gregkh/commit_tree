[SCSI] scsi_lib: use correct DMA device in __scsi_alloc_queue

Currently, __scsi_alloc_queue uses SCSI host's parent device
as DMA device to set segment boundary. But the parent device may not
refer to the DMA device. For example, for ATA disk, SCSI host's parent
device now refers to ATA port.

Since commit d139b9b([SCSI] scsi_lib_dma: fix bug with dma maps on
nested scsi objects), a new field Scsi_Host->dma_dev was introduced
to refer to the real DMA device.

Use ->dma_dev in __scsi_alloc_queue to correctly set segment
boundary.
