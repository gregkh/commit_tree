net: implement IP_RECVTOS for IP_PKTOPTIONS

Currently, it is not easily possible to get TOS/DSCP value of packets from
an incoming TCP stream. The mechanism is there, IP_PKTOPTIONS getsockopt
with IP_RECVTOS set, the same way as incoming TTL can be queried. This is
not actually implemented for TOS, though.

This patch adds this functionality, both for IPv4 (IP_PKTOPTIONS) and IPv6
(IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS). For IPv4, like in the IP_RECVTTL case, the value of
the TOS field is stored from the other party's ACK.

This is needed for proxies which require DSCP transparency. One such example
is at http://zph.bratcheda.org/.
