sh-eth: use netdev stats structure and fix dma_map_single

No need to maintain a parallel net_device_stats structure in
sh_eth_private, since we have a generic one in netdev

Fix two dma_map_single() incorrect parameters, passing skb->tail instead
of skb->data. Seems that there is no corresponding dmap_unmap_single()
calls for the moment in this driver.
