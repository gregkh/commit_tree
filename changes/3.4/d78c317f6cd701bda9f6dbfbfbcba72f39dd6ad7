[SCSI] libfc: Add support for FDMI

This patch adds support for Fabric Device Management
Interface as per FC-GS-4 spec. in libfc. Any driver
making use of libfc can enable fdmi state machine
for a given lport.

If lport has enabled FDMI support the lport state
machine will transition into FDMI after completing
the DNS states and before entering the SCR state.
The FDMI state transition is such that if there is an
error, it won't stop the lport state machine from
transitioning and the it will behave as if there was
no FDMI support.

The FDMI HBA attributes are registed with the Management
server via Register HBA (RHBA) command and the port
attributes are reigstered using the Register Port(RPA)
command.
