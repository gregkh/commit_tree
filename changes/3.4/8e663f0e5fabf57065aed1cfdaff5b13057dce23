NFSv4.1: Fix matching of the stateids when returning a delegation

nfs41_validate_delegation_stateid is broken if we supply a stateid with
a non-zero sequence id. Instead of trying to match the sequence id,
the function assumes that we always want to error. While this is
true for a delegation callback, it is not true in general.

Also fix a typo in nfs4_callback_recall.
