drm/udl: initial UDL driver (v4)

This is an initial drm/kms driver for the displaylink devices.

Supports fb_defio,
supports KMS dumb interface
supports 24bpp via conversion to 16bpp, hw can do this better.
supports hot unplug using new drm core features.

On an unplug, it disables connector polling, unplugs connectors
from sysfs, unplugs fbdev layer (using Kay's API), drops all the
USB device URBs, and call the drm core to unplug the device.

This driver is based in large parts on udlfb.c so I've licensed
it under GPLv2.
