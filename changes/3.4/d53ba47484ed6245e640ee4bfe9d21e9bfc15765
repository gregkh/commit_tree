Btrfs: use commit root when loading free space cache

A user reported that booting his box up with btrfs root on 3.4 was way
slower than on 3.3 because I removed the ideal caching code.  It turns out
that we don't load the free space cache if we're in a commit for deadlock
reasons, but since we're reading the cache and it hasn't changed yet we are
safe reading the inode and free space item from the commit root, so do that
and remove all of the deadlock checks so we don't unnecessarily skip loading
the free space cache.  The user reported this fixed the slowness.  Thanks,
