pinctrl: remove pin and hogs locks from struct pinctrl_dev

struct pinctrl_dev's pin_desc_tree_lock and pinctrl_hogs_lock aren't
useful; the data they protect is read-only except when registering or
unregistering a pinctrl_dev, and at those times, it doesn't make sense to
protect one part of the structure independently from the rest.

Move pinctrl_init_device_debugfs() to the end of pinctrl_register() so
that debugfs can't access the struct pinctrl_dev until it's fully
initialized, i.e. after the hogs are set up.
