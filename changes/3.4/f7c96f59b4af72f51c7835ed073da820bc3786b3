Revert "powerpc/usb: fix usb CTRL_PHY_CLK_VALID breaks on some platform"

This reverts commit 79857e8e7b1ba740f8025b540f1e171c9a0a5d31.

To quote Shengzhou Liu:
	I'm sorry, please don't apply this patch.
	It appears not only on P1022 platform.
	There will be more breaks on other platforms regarding
	CTRL_PHY_CLK_VALID bit.
	I will post a new patch with well compatibility on all
	platforms as soon as I get necessary confirmations.
