Revert "serial/8250_pci: init-quirk msi support for kt serial controller"

This reverts commit e86ff4a63c9fdd875ba8492577cd1ad2252f525c.

This tried to enforce the semantics of one interrupt per iir read of the
THRE (transmit-hold empty) status, but events from other sources
(particularly modem status) defeat this guarantee.

This change also broke 8250_pci suspend/resume support as
pciserial_resume_ports() re-runs .init() quirks, but does not run
.exit() quirks in pciserial_suspend_ports() leading to reports like:

  sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:16.3/msi_irqs'

...and a subsequent crash.  The mismatch of init/exit at suspend/resume
seems like a bug in its own right.
