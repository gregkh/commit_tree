mtd: nand/fsmc: Read only 512 + 13 bytes for 8bit NAND devices

The ECC logic of FSMC works on 512 bytes data + 13 bytes ECC to generate error
indices of up to 8 incorrect bits. The FSMC driver reads 14 instead of 13 oob
bytes to accommodate for 16 bit device as well.

Unfortunately, the internal ecc state machine gets corrupted for 8 bit devices
reading 512 + 14 bytes of data resulting in error indices not getting reported.

Fix this by reading 14 bytes only for 16 bit devices
