e100: Support RXALL feature flag.

This allows the NIC to receive packets with bad FCS
and other errors.  Good for sniffing packets on flakey
networks.

v4:  Only flax rx-over-length errors if pkt is beyond
   maximum expected packet size, not just beyond the MTU.
   This matches the existing logic for this counter.
