b43: Load firmware from a work queue and not from the probe routine

Recent changes in udev are causing problems for drivers that load firmware
from the probe routine. As b43 has such a structure, it must be changed.
As this driver loads more than 1 firmware file, changing to the asynchronous routine
request_firmware_nowait() would be complicated. In this implementation, the probe
routine starts a queue that calls the firmware loading routines.
