ALSA: hda - fix printing of high HDMI sample rates

A previous commit af65cbf296 (ALSA: hdmi: fix printout of SAD sampling
rates) fixed the sample rates shown in /proc/asound/cardX/eldY and
kernel log to not be entirely wrong. However, a missing rate from the
array added in the patch causes HDMI rates 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz,
and 192 kHz to be shown as 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz, 192 kHz, and 384 kHz,
respectively.

Fix the reporting by adding the ALSA rate 64 kHz into the conversion
array between 48 kHz and 88.2 kHz.
