KVM: s390: ucontrol: per vcpu address spaces

This patch introduces two ioctls for virtual cpus, that are only
valid for kernel virtual machines that are controlled by userspace.
Each virtual cpu has its individual address space in this mode of
operation, and each address space is backed by the gmap
implementation just like the address space for regular KVM guests.
KVM_S390_UCAS_MAP allows to map a part of the user's virtual address
space to the vcpu. Starting offset and length in both the user and
the vcpu address space need to be aligned to 1M.
KVM_S390_UCAS_UNMAP can be used to unmap a range of memory from a
virtual cpu in a similar way.
