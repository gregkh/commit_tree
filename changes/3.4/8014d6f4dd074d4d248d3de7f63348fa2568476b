ARM: at91: AIC and GPIO IRQ device tree initialization

Both AIC and GPIO controllers are now using the standard of_irq_init()
function to initialize IRQs in case of DT use.
The DT specific initialization functions are now separated from the
non-DT case and are now using "linear" irq domains.
The .map() irqdomain operation is responsible for positioning the IRQ
handlers. In AIC case, the Linux IRQ number is directly programmed in
the hardware to avoid an additional reverse mapping operation.
The AIC position its irq domain as the "default" irq domain.

For DT case, the priority is not yet filled in the SMR. It will be the
subject of another patch.
