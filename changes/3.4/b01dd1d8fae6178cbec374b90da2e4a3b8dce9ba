NFS: Call test_stateid() and free_stateid() with correct stateids

I noticed that test_stateid() was always using the same stateid for open
and lock recovery.  After poking around a bit, I discovered that it was
always testing with a delegation stateid (even if there was no
delegation present).  I figured this wasn't correct, so now delegation
and open stateids are tested during open_expired() and lock stateids are
tested during lock_expired().
