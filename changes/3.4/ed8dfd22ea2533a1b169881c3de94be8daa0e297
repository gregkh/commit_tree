ARM: OMAP2+: I2C: always compile I2C reset code, even if I2C driver is not built

During kernel init, we reset all IP blocks on the OMAP that we can,
even if there is no driver compiled for that IP block.  Unlike most IP
blocks, the I2C block requires some extra programming for this to
work.  This reset code is incorrectly omitted when the I2C driver is
deselected.  In this circumstance, the build breaks.  Fix by compiling
the I2C reset code unconditionally.
