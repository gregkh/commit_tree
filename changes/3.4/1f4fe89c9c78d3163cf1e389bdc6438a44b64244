[SCSI] libsas: Remove redundant phy state notification calls.

In the case of an explicit sas_phy_enable call to disable a phy,
the LLDD provides the calls to sas_phy_disconnected and the
PHYE_LOSS_OF_SIGNAL event.

NOTE: This assumes that the lldd(s) generate the notification, which
appears to be the case, but only verfied on isci.
