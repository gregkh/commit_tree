powerpc: Add support for page fault retry and fatal signals

Other architectures such as x86 and ARM have been growing
new support for features like retrying page faults after
dropping the mm semaphore to break contention, or being
able to return from a stuck page fault when a SIGKILL is
pending.

This refactors our implementation of do_page_fault() to
move the error handling out of line in a way similar to
x86 and adds support for those two features.
