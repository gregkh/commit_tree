KVM: Move gfn_to_memslot() to kvm_host.h

This moves __gfn_to_memslot() and search_memslots() from kvm_main.c to
kvm_host.h to reduce the code duplication caused by the need for
non-modular code in arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rm_mmu.c to call
gfn_to_memslot() in real mode.

Rather than putting gfn_to_memslot() itself in a header, which would
lead to increased code size, this puts __gfn_to_memslot() in a header.
Then, the non-modular uses of gfn_to_memslot() are changed to call
__gfn_to_memslot() instead.  This way there is only one place in the
source code that needs to be changed should the gfn_to_memslot()
implementation need to be modified.

On powerpc, the Book3S HV style of KVM has code that is called from
real mode which needs to call gfn_to_memslot() and thus needs this.
(Module code is allocated in the vmalloc region, which can't be
accessed in real mode.)

With this, we can remove builtin_gfn_to_memslot() from book3s_hv_rm_mmu.c.
