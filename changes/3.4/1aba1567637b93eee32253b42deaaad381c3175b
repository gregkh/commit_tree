nfs4: fix referrals on mounts that use IPv6 addrs

All referrals (IPv4 addr, IPv6 addr, and DNS) are broken on mounts of
IPv6 addresses, because validation code uses a path that is parsed
from the dev_name ("<server>:<path>") by splitting on the first colon and
colons are used in IPv6 addrs.
This patch ignores colons within IPv6 addresses that are escaped by '[' and ']'.
