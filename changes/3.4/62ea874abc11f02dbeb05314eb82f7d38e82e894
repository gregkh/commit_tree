ASoC: Provide REGULATOR_SUPPLY widget type

Modern devices allow systems to enable and disable individual supplies on
the device, allowing additional power saving by switching off regulators
which power portions of the device which are not currently in use. Add a
new SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY widget type factoring out the code for
managing such widgets from individual drivers.

The widget name will be used as the supply name when requesting the
regulator from the regulator API.
