rbd: do some refactoring

A few blocks of code are rearranged a bit here:
    - In rbd_header_from_disk():
	- Don't bother computing snap_count until we're sure the
	  on-disk header starts with a good signature.
	- Move a few independent lines of code so they are *after* a
	  check for a failed memory allocation.
	- Get rid of unnecessary local variable "ret".
    - Make a few other changes in rbd_read_header(), similar to the
      above--just moving things around a bit while preserving the
      functionality.
    - In rbd_rq_fn(), just assign rq in the while loop's controlling
      expression rather than duplicating it before and at the end of
      the loop body.  This allows the use of "continue" rather than
      "goto next" in a number of spots.
    - Rearrange the logic in snap_by_name().  End result is the same.
