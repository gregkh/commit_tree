staging: ramster: local compression + tmem

Copy files from drivers/staging/zcache.  Ramster compresses pages
locally before transmitting them to another node, so we can
leverage the zcache and tmem code directly.  Note: there are
no ramster-specific changes yet to these files.

(Why copy?  The ramster tmem.c/tmem.h changes are definitely shareable
between zcache and ramster; the eventual destination for tmem.c
is the linux lib directory.  Ramster changes to zcache are more substantial
and zcache is currently undergoing some significant unrelated changes
(including a new allocator and breaking zcache-main.c into smaller files),
so it seemed best to branch temporarily and merge later.)
