usb: musb: omap: fix the error check for pm_runtime_get_sync

pm_runtime_get_sync returns a signed integer. In case of errors
it returns a negative value. This patch fixes the error check
by making it signed instead of unsigned thus preventing register
access if get_sync_fails. Also passes the error cause to the
debug message.
