dm raid: handle failed devices during start up

The dm-raid code currently fails to create a RAID array if any of the
superblocks cannot be read.  This was an oversight as there is already
code to handle this case if the values ('- -') were provided for the
failed array position.

With this patch, if a superblock cannot be read, the array position's
fields are initialized as though '- -' was set in the table.  That is,
the device is failed and the position should not be used, but if there
is sufficient redundancy, the array should still be activated.
