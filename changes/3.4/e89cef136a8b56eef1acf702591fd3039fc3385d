perf tool: Fix perf stack to non executable on x86_64

By adding following objects:
  bench/mem-memset-x86-64-asm.o
  bench/mem-memcpy-x86-64-asm.o
the x86_64 perf binary ended up with executable stack.

The reason was that above objects are assembler sourced and are missing the
GNU-stack note section. In such case the linker assumes that the final binary
should not be restricted at all and mark the stack as RWX.

Adding section ".note.GNU-stack" definition to mentioned objects, with all
flags disabled, thus omiting those objects from linker stack flags decision.
