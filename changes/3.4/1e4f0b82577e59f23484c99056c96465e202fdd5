i2c: mxs: disable QUEUE when sending is done

Since the last fixes to this driver ensure now the queue termination is
done correctly, we can finally disable the queue after a transfer
without problems. The gain is that it will only be reenabled after the
next transfer is fully set up. Before, the queue was running all the
time and if the setup of the next message was interrupted by another
thread, an incomplete buffer could have been sent, padded with zeroes.
