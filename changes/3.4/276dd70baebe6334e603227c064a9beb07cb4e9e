ALSA: hda/realtek - Adjust badness calculation for multi-ios

Try harder to fit the multi-io pins also by checking the hard-wired
connections for multi-ios.  Also, the badness values are adjusted to
prioritize the multi-ios as more valuable.  These changes will enable
the multi-io on some machines without losing the current capability.
