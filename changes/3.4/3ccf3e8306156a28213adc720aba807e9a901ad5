printk/sched: Introduce special printk_sched() for those awkward moments

There's a few awkward printk()s inside of scheduler guts that people
prefer to keep but really are rather deadlock prone. Fudge around it
by storing the text in a per-cpu buffer and poll it using the existing
printk_tick() handler.

This will drop output when its more frequent than once a tick, however
only the affinity thing could possible go that fast and for that just
one should suffice to notify the admin he's done something silly..
