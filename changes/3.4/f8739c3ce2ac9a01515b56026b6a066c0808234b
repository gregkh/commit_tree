xfs: per-filesystem dquot LRU lists

Replace the global dquot lru lists with a per-filesystem one.

Note that the shrinker isn't wire up to the per-superblock VFS shrinker
infrastructure as would have problems summing up and splitting the counts
for inodes and dquots.  I don't think this is a major problem as the quota
cache isn't as interwinded with the inode cache as the dentry cache is,
because an inode that is dropped from the cache will generally release
a dquot reference, but most of the time it won't be the last one.
