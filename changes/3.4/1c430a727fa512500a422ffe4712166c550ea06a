net: compare_ether_addr[_64bits]() has no ordering

Neither compare_ether_addr() nor compare_ether_addr_64bits()
(as it can fall back to the former) have comparison semantics
like memcmp() where the sign of the return value indicates sort
order. We had a bug in the wireless code due to a blind memcmp
replacement because of this.

A cursory look suggests that the wireless bug was the only one
due to this semantic difference.
