rbd: fix module sysfs setup/teardown code

Once rbd_bus_type is registered, it allows an "add" operation via
the /sys/bus/rbd/add bus attribute, and adding a new rbd device that
way establishes a connection between the device and rbd_root_dev.
But rbd_root_dev is not registered until after the rbd_bus_type
registration is complete.  This could (in principle anyway) result
in an invalid state.

Since rbd_root_dev has no tie to rbd_bus_type we can reorder these
two initializations and never be faced with this scenario.

In addition, unregister the device in the event the bus registration
fails at module init time.
