[SCSI] pm8001: fix lockup on phy_control hard reset.

pm8001_phy_control PHY_FUNC_HARD_RESET locks up on second try via
smp_phy_control because response HW_EVENT_PHY_START_STATUS fails to complete
previous command. The PM8001F_RUN_TIME flag is not treated as a bit, but a
state in all readers, yet once we are operational or in the run time state,
the flags use a bit-set operation.
