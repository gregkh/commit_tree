includecheck: delete any duplicate instances of module.h

Different tree maintainers picked up independently generated
trivial compile fixes based on linux-next testing, resulting
in some cases where a file would have got more than one addition
of module.h once everything was all merged together.

Delete any duplicates so includecheck isn't complaining about
anything related to module.h/export.h changes.
