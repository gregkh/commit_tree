TTY: simserial, remove static initialization

We do not use any of the preinitialized rs_state members for something
real. So there is no need to initialize them. At the places we used
them for printing, just print the values.

And since only one port is supported, get rid of the loop. This
simplifies simrs_init a heap. Thus we can handle fail paths in a
standard way without panicing.
