ARM: sync sched_clock() state on suspend

Ensure that the software state for sched_clock() is updated at the
point of suspend so that we avoid losing ticks since the last update.

This prevents the platform dependent possibility that sched_clock()
may appear to go backwards across a suspend/resume cycle.
