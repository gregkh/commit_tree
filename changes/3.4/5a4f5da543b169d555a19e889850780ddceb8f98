ARM: 7337/1: ptrace: fix ptrace_read_user for !CONFIG_MMU platforms

Commit 68b7f715 ("nommu: ptrace support") added definitions for
PT_TEXT_ADDR and friends, as well as adding ptrace support for reading
from these magic offsets.

Unfortunately, this has probably never worked, since ptrace_read_user
predicates reading on off < sizeof(struct user), returning -EIO
otherwise.

This patch moves the offset size check until after we have tried to
match it against either a magic value or an offset into pt_regs.
