USB: ehci-tegra: remove redundant gpio_set_value

The immediately preceding gpio_direction_output() already set the value,
so there's no need to repeat it. This also prevents gpio_set_value() from
WARNing when the GPIO is sleepable (e.g. is on an I2C expander); the set
direction API is always sleepable, but plain set_value isn't.
