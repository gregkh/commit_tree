drivers: hv: Increase the number of VCPUs supported in the guest

The current code arbirarily limited the number of CPUs the guest could have.
Change that so that we can support the maximum number of CPUs the guest can
support. While we use NR_CPUS to size the per-cpu state all we are allocating
based on NR_CPUS are the  pointers to per-cpu state that will be allocatted in
the context of the initializing CPU. This patch triggers a checkpatch warning
for the usage of NR_CPU and since all we are allocating a couple of pointers
per CPU, it should be ok.
