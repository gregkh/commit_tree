PM / devfreq: add relation of recommended frequency.

The semantics of "target frequency" given to devfreq driver from
devfreq framework has always been interpretted as "at least" or GLB
(greatest lower bound). However, the framework might want the
device driver to limit its max frequency (LUB: least upper bound),
especially if it is given by thermal framework (it's too hot).

Thus, the target fuction should have another parameter to express
whether the framework wants GLB or LUB. And, the additional parameter,
"u32 flags", does it.

With the update, devfreq_recommended_opp() is also updated.
