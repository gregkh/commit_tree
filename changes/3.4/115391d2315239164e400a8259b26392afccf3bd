Btrfs: only use the existing eb if it's count isn't 0

We can run into a problem where we find an eb for our existing page already on
the radix tree but it has a ref count of 0.  It hasn't yet been removed by RCU
yet so this can cause issues where we will use the EB after free.  So do
atomic_inc_not_zero on the exists->refs and if it is zero just do
synchronize_rcu() and try again.  We won't have to worry about new allocators
coming in since they will block on the page lock at this point.  Thanks,
