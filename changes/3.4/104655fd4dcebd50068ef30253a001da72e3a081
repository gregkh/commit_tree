dm thin: support discards

Support discards in the thin target.

On discard the corresponding mapping(s) are removed from the thin
device.  If the associated block(s) are no longer shared the discard
is passed to the underlying device.

All bios other than discards now have an associated deferred_entry
that is saved to the 'all_io_entry' in endio_hook.  When non-discard
IO completes and associated mappings are quiesced any discards that
were deferred, via ds_add_work() in process_discard(), will be queued
for processing by the worker thread.
