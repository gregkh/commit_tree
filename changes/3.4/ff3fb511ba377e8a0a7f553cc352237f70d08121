perf/x86: Sync branch stack sampling with precise_sampling

If precise sampling is enabled on Intel x86 then perf_event uses PEBS.
To correct for the off-by-one error of PEBS, perf_event uses LBR when
precise_sample > 1.

On Intel x86 PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK is implemented using LBR,
therefore both features must be coordinated as they may not
configure LBR the same way.

For PEBS, LBR needs to capture all branches at the priv level of
the associated event.

This patch checks that the branch type and priv level of BRANCH_STACK
is compatible with that of the PEBS LBR requirement, thereby allowing:

   $ perf record -b any,u -e instructions:upp ....

But:

   $ perf record -b any_call,u -e instructions:upp

Is not possible.
