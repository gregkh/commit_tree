netfilter: nf_conntrack: pass timeout array to l4->new and l4->packet

This patch defines a new interface for l4 protocol trackers:

unsigned int *(*get_timeouts)(struct net *net);

that is used to return the array of unsigned int that contains
the timeouts that will be applied for this flow. This is passed
to the l4proto->new(...) and l4proto->packet(...) functions to
specify the timeout policy.

This interface allows per-net global timeout configuration
(although only DCCP supports this by now) and it will allow
custom custom timeout configuration by means of follow-up
patches.
