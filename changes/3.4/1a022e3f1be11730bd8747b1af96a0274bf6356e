idle, x86: Allow off-lined CPU to enter deeper C states

Currently when a CPU is off-lined it enters either MWAIT-based idle or,
if MWAIT is not desired or supported, HLT-based idle (which places the
processor in C1 state). This patch allows processors without MWAIT
support to stay in states deeper than C1.
