btrfs: Don't BUG_ON() errors in update_ref_for_cow()

The only caller of update_ref_for_cow() is __btrfs_cow_block() which was
originally ignoring any return values. update_ref_for_cow() however doesn't
look like a candidate to become a void function - there are a few places
where errors can occur.

So instead I changed update_ref_for_cow() to bubble all errors up (instead
of BUG_ON). __btrfs_cow_block() was then updated to catch and BUG_ON() any
errors from update_ref_for_cow(). The end effect is that we have no change
in behavior, but about 8 different places where a BUG_ON(ret) was removed.

Obviously a future patch will have to address the BUG_ON() in
__btrfs_cow_block().
