pch_uart: Add Kontron COMe-mTT10 uart clock quirk

Add UART clock quirk for the Kontron COMe-mTT10 module.

The board has previously been called nanoETXexpress-TT, therefore this
is also checked.

As suggested by Darren Hart the comparison in this patch version is
placed after the FRI2 checks to ensure it will also work with possible
upcoming changes to the FRI2 firmware.

This patch follows the patchset submitted by Darren Hart at
commit a46f5533ecfc7bbdd646d84fdab8656031a715c6.
