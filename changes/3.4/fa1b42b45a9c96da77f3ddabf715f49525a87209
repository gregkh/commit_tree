powerpc/qe: Update the SNUM table for MPC8569 Rev2.0

The MPC8569 Rev2.0 has the correct SNUM table as QE Reference Manual, we
must follow it.

However the Rev1.0 silicon need the old SNUM table as workaround due to
Rev1.0 silicon SNUM erratum.

So, we support both snum table, and choose the one FDT tell us.
And u-boot will fixup FDT according to SPRN_SVR.
