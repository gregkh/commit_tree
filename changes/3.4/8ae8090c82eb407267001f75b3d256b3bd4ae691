usb: gadget: udc-core: fix asymmetric calls in remove_driver

During modprobe of gadget driver, pullup is called after
udc_start. In order to make the exit path symmetric when
removing a gadget driver, call pullup before ->udc_stop.

This is needed to avoid issues with PM where udc_stop
disables the module completely (put IP in reset state,
cut functional and interface clocks, and so on), which
prevents us from accessing the IP's address space,
thus creating the possibility of an abort exception
when we try to access IP's address space after clocks
are off.
