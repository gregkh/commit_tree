mfd: Fix modular builds of rc5t583 regulator support

The combination of commit 1b1247dd75aa5cf5fae54a3bec7280046e9c7957

    "mfd: Add support for RICOH PMIC RC5T583"

and commit 6ffc3270210efa2bea526953a142ffc908f5bd86

    "regulator: Add support for RICOH PMIC RC5T583 regulator"

are causing the i386 allmodconfig builds to fail with this:

  ERROR: "rc5t583_update" [drivers/regulator/rc5t583-regulator.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "rc5t583_set_bits" [drivers/regulator/rc5t583-regulator.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "rc5t583_clear_bits" [drivers/regulator/rc5t583-regulator.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "rc5t583_read" [drivers/regulator/rc5t583-regulator.ko] undefined!

and this:

  ERROR: "rc5t583_ext_power_req_config" [drivers/regulator/rc5t583-regulator.ko] undefined!

For the 1st four, make the simple ops static inline, instead of
polluting the namespace with trivial exports.  For the last one,
add an EXPORT_SYMBOL.
