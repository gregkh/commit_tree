ARM: EXYNOS: fix cycle count for periodic mode of clock event timers

EXYNOS SOC series use MCT for kernel timer and MCT has two types of
clock event timers, which are mct-comp and mct-tick.
Because the clock rate of each event timer is diffent from the other,
this patch fixes cycles_per_jiffy for each timer's periodic mode.
