KVM: ensure async PF event wakes up vcpu from halt

If vcpu executes hlt instruction while async PF is waiting to be delivered
vcpu can block and deliver async PF only after another even wakes it
up. This happens because kvm_check_async_pf_completion() will remove
completion event from vcpu->async_pf.done before entering kvm_vcpu_block()
and this will make kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable() return false. The solution
is to make vcpu runnable when processing completion.
