x86/ioapic: Use legacy_pic to set correct gsi-irq mapping

Using compile time NR_LEGACY_IRQS causes the wrong gsi-irq
mapping on non-PC platforms, such as Moorestown. This patch uses
legacy_pic abstraction to set the correct number of legacy
interrupts at runtime. For Moorestown, nr_legacy_irqs = 0. We
have 1:1 mapping for gsi-irq even within the legacy irq range.
