kexec: crash: don't save swapper_pg_dir for !CONFIG_MMU configurations

nommu platforms don't have very interesting swapper_pg_dir pointers and
usually just #define them to NULL, meaning that we can't include them in
the vmcoreinfo on the kexec crash path.

This patch only saves the swapper_pg_dir if we have an MMU.
