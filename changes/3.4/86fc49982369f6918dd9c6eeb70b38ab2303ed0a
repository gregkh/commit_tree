ASoC: cs42l73: don't use negative array index

If cs42l73_get_mclkx_coeff() returns < 0 (which it can) in
sound/soc/codecs/cs42l73.c::cs42l73_set_mclk(), then we'll be using
the (negative) return value as array index on the very next line of
code - that's bad.

Catch the negative return value and propagate it to the caller (which
checks for it) and things are a bit more sane :-)
