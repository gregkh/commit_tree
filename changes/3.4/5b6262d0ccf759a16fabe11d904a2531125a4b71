sfc: Replace some literal constants with EFX_PAGE_SIZE/EFX_BUF_SIZE

The 'page size' for PCIe DMA, i.e. the alignment of boundaries at
which DMA must be broken, is 4KB.  Name this value as EFX_PAGE_SIZE
and use it in efx_max_tx_len().  Redefine EFX_BUF_SIZE as
EFX_PAGE_SIZE since its value is also a result of that requirement,
and use it in efx_init_special_buffer().
