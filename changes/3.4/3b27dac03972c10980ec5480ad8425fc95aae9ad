mtd: unify initialization of erase_info->fail_addr

Initialization of 'erase_info->fail_addr' to MTD_FAIL_ADDR_UNKNOWN prior
erase operation is duplicated accross several MTD drivers, and also taken
care of by some MTD users as well.

Harmonize it: initialize 'fail_addr' within 'mtd_erase()' interface.
