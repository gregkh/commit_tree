perf diff: Fix to work with new hists design

The perf diff command is broken since:
  perf hists: Threaded addition and sorting of entries
  commit 1980c2ebd7020d82c024b8c4046849b38e78e7da

Several places were broken:
  - hists data need to be collected into opened sessions instead
    of into events
  - session's hists data need to be initialized properly when the
    session is created
  - hist_entry__pcnt_snprintf: the percentage and displacement
    buffer preparation must not use 'ret' because it's used
    as a pointer to the final buffer
