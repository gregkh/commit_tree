ASoC: omap McBSP: Clear rx_irq at probe time for OMAP4

On OMAP4 we have one interrupt line per McBSP port.
At probe time tx, and rx irq value will be -ENXIO,
and only the tx irq will get corrected.
In omap_mcbsp_request if the rx_irq is not 0 we proceed,
and try to request the interrupt, which will fail on
OMAP4 (rx_irq == -6).
To avoid this error, clear the rx_irq at probe time
on OMAP4.
