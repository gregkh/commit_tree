staging: ramster: xvmalloc allocation files

RAMster implements peer-to-peer transcendent memory, allowing a "cluster"
of kernels to dynamically pool their RAM.

Zcache is in the process of converting allocators, from xvmalloc to zsmalloc.
Further, RAMster V5 testing to date has been done only with xvmalloc.
To avoid merging problems, a linux-3.2 copy of xvmalloc is incorporated by
this patch.  Later patches will be able to eliminate xvmalloc and use zsmalloc.
