ath6kl: Clear the IE in firmware if not set

Remove check so that IE in firmware is cleared if not set. Without this fix, any
previously set IE will be used incorrectly in the next frame. For example,
consider the scenario where a P2P device scan is followed by a regular station
scan. The P2P IE set by the P2P scan needs to be cleared, otherwise the station
scan will contain the P2P IE.
