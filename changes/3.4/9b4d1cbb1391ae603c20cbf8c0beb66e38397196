ARM: SAMSUNG: add missing MMC_CAP2_BROKEN_VOLTAGE capability

Commit 6e8201f57c935 "mmc: core: add the capability for broken voltage"
introduced a new quirk to indicate that MMC core should ignore voltage
change errors reported by the regulators core. This is required to get
SDHCI working on UniversalC210, NURI and GONI boards again after commit
ceb6143b2df81c ("mmc: sdhci: fix vmmc handling").
