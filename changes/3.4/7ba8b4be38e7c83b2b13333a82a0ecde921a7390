Bluetooth: Add hci_do_le_scan()

This patch adds to hci_core the hci_do_le_scan function which
should be used to scan LE devices.

In order to enable LE scan, hci_do_le_scan() sends commands (Set
LE Scan Parameters and Set LE Scan Enable) to the controller and
waits for its results. If commands were executed successfully a
delayed work is scheduled to disable the ongoing scanning after
some amount of time. This function blocks.
