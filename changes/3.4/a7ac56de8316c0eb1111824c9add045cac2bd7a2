ARM: kirkwood: add missing kexec.h include

Fixes the following build error when CONFIG_KEXEC is enabled:
  CC      arch/arm/mach-kirkwood/board-dt.o

arch/arm/mach-kirkwood/board-dt.c:52:2: error: 'kexec_reinit' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/arm/mach-kirkwood/board-dt.c:52:2: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
