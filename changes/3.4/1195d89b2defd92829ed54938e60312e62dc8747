NFC: Download TI NFC init script

Download TI NFC init script during nfcwilink open operation,
after the NFC channel is registered with TI shared transport.
TI NFC init script is written in BTS format.
First, read the chip version via a special vendor specific command.
Second, we request the relevant BTS file from the user space, and
then send the BTS commands to the chip.
