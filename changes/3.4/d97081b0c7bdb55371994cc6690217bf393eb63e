rbd: move ctl_mutex lock inside rbd_get_client()

Since rbd_get_client() is only called in one place, move the
acquisition of the mutex around that call inside that function.

Furthermore, within rbd_get_client(), it appears the mutex only
needs to be held while calling rbd_client_create().  (Moving
the lock inside that function will wait for the next patch.)
