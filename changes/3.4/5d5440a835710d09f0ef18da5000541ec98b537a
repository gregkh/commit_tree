usbnet: don't clear urb->dev in tx_complete

URB unlinking is always racing with its completion and tx_complete
may be called before or during running usb_unlink_urb, so tx_complete
must not clear urb->dev since it will be used in unlink path,
otherwise invalid memory accesses or usb device leak may be caused
inside usb_unlink_urb.
