Staging: rtl8712/rtl8192u: move USB device ID within staging drivers.

It seems the USB device ID 0bda:8192 is wrongly assigned to the
RTL8192SU chip and not to the RTL8191SU chip in the USB database.
So this patch moves this device ID from the rtl8192u staging
driver to the rtl8712 staging driver.

This patch was tested with a Radicom WIFIHU embedded wireless
module with a RTL8191SU chip and the USB device ID 0bda:8192.
Without the patch the rtl8192u driver claims this device, but
it does not work. With the patch the rtl8712 driver services
this device and it works.
