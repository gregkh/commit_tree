rcu: Set RCU CPU stall times via sysfs

The default CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_TIMEOUT value of 60 seconds has served
Linux users well for production use for quite some time.  However, for
debugging, there will be more than three minutes between subsequent
stall-warning messages.  This can be an annoyingly long wait if you
are trying to work out where the offending infinite loop is hiding.

Therefore, this commit provides a rcu_cpu_stall_timeout sysfs
parameter that may be adjusted at boot time and at runtime to speed
up debugging.
