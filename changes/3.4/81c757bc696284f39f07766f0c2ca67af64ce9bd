[SCSI] libsas: execute transport link resets with libata-eh via host workqueue

Link resets leave ata affiliations intact, so arrange for libsas to make
an effort to avoid dropping the device due to a slow-to-recover link.
Towards this end carry out reset in the host workqueue so that it can
check for ata devices and kick the reset request to libata.  Hard
resets, in contrast, bypass libata since they are meant for associating
an ata device with another initiator in the domain (tears down
affiliations).

Need to add a new transport_sas_phy_reset() since the current
sas_phy_reset() is a utility function to libsas lldds.  They are not
prepared for it to loop back into eh.
