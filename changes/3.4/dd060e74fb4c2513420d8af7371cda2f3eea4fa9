[SCSI] fcoe: remove frame dropping code from fcoe_percpu_clean

commit e7a51997dad4e17395be1209970e18d2e9305b24 ([SCSI] fcoe: flush per-cpu
thread work when destroying interface) added a skb flush to the fcoe_rx_list,
which ensures that we push any pending frames on the list through the per-cpu
receive thread.  Because of this, its redundant to lock and scan the list
first, dropping any arriving frames.
