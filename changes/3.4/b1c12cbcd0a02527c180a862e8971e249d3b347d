mm/hugetlb: fix warning in alloc_huge_page/dequeue_huge_page_vma

Fix a gcc warning (and bug?) introduced in cc9a6c877 ("cpuset: mm: reduce
large amounts of memory barrier related damage v3")

Local variable "page" can be uninitialized if the nodemask from vma policy
does not intersects with nodemask from cpuset.  Even if it doesn't happens
it is better to initialize this variable explicitly than to introduce
a kernel oops in a weird corner case.

mm/hugetlb.c: In function `alloc_huge_page':
mm/hugetlb.c:1135:5: warning: `page' may be used uninitialized in this function
