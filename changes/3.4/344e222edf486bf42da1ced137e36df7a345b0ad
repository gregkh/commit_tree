ACPI throttling: fix endian bug in acpi_read_throttling_status()

Using a u64 here creates an endian bug.  We store a u32 number in the
top byte which is a larger number than intended on big endian systems.
There is no reason to use a 64 bit data type here, I guess it was just
an oversight.

I removed the initialization to zero as well.  It's needed with a u64
but with a u32, the variable gets initialized properly inside the call
to acpi_os_read_port().
