mmc: sh_mmcif: double clock speed

Correct an off-by one error when calculating the clock divisor in cases
where the host clock is a power of two of the target clock.  Previously the
divisor was one greater than the correct value in these cases leading to
the clock being set at half the desired speed.

Thanks to Guennadi Liakhovetski for working with me on the logic for this
change.
