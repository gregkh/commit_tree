GFS2: Clean up log flush header writing

We already send both a pre and post flush to the block device
when writing a journal header. There is no need to wait for
the previous I/O specifically when we do this, unless we've
turned "barriers" off.

As a side effect, this also cleans up the code path for flushing
the journal and makes it more readable.
