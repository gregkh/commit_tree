drm: Validate requested virtual size against allocated fb size

mplayer -vo fbdev tries to create a screen that is twice as tall as the
allocated framebuffer for "doublebuffering". By default, and all in-tree
users, only sufficient memory is allocated and mapped to satisfy the
smallest framebuffer and the virtual size is no larger than the actual.
For these users, we should therefore reject any userspace request to
create a screen that requires a buffer larger than the framebuffer
originally allocated.
