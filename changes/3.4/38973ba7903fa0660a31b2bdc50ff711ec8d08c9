powerpc/PCI: compute I/O space bus-to-resource offset consistently

Make sure we compute CPU addresses (resource start/end) the same way both
when we set up the I/O aperture (hose->io_resource) and when we use
pcibios_bus_to_resource() to convert BAR values into resources.

This fixes a build failure ("cast from pointer to integer of different
size" in configs where resource_size_t is 64 bits but pointers are 32 bits)
I introduced in 6c5705fec63d.
