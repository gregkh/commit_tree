blackfin: fix cmpxchg build fails from system.h fallout

Commit 3bed8d67469c ("Disintegrate asm/system.h for Blackfin [ver #2]")
introduced arch/blackfin/include/asm/cmpxchg.h but has it also including
the asm-generic one which causes this:

  arch/blackfin/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:82:29: note: previous definition of '__xchg' was here
  make[2]: *** [arch/blackfin/kernel/asm-offsets.s] Error 1

It really only needs two simple defines from asm-generic, so just use
those instead.
