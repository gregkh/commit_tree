staging:iio:core set the iio_dev.info pointer to null on unregister under lock.

This prevents use of provider callbacks after it has been unregistered.
Note that all code using this that can be called from a consumer *must*
check the pointer before using and hold the info_exist_lock throughout
the usage of the callbacks in info.
