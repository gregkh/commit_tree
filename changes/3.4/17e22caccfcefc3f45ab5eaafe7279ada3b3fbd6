ARM: omap: pandora: fix usbhs platform data

It turned out wrong OMAP HSUSB port was configured on pandora,
but still managed to work somehow. This was noticed after enabling
in-kernel mux, where USB muxing was causing other devices not to work,
because hsusb1 pins (instead of hsusb2) were wrongly remuxed, which
are used for other things on pandora.
