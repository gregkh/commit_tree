staging: zcache: fix length type mismatch

This fixes a type mismatch in the compression code where
a size_t pointer was cast to a unsigned int pointer.  On
little endian archs, there is no issue.  However on big
endian archs, the value is incorrect, taking the high
order bits and truncating the lower order bits.
