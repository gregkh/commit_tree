DMA: PL330: Merge PL330 driver into drivers/dma/

Currently there were two part of DMAC PL330 driver for
support old styled s3c-pl330 which has been merged into
drivers/dma/pl330.c driver. Actually, there is no reason
to separate them now.

Basically this patch merges arch/arm/common/pl330.c into
drivers/dma/pl330.c driver and removes useless exported
symbol, externed function and so on.

The newer pl330 driver tested on SMDKV310 and SMDK4212 boards
