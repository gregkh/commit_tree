vfs: tidy up sparse warnings in fs/namei.c

While doing the fs/namei.c cleanups, I ran sparse on it, and it pointed
out other large integers and a couple of cases of us using '0' instead
of the proper 'NULL'.

Sparse still doesn't understand some of the conditional locking going
on, but that's no excuse for not fixing up the trivial stuff.
