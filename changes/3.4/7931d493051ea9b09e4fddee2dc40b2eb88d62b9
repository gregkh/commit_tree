x86/spinlocks: Eliminate TICKET_MASK

The definition of it being questionable already (unnecessarily
including a cast), and it being used in a single place that can
be written shorter without it, remove this #define.

Along the same lines, simplify __ticket_spin_is_locked()'s main
expression, which was the more convoluted way because of needs
that went away with the recent type changes by Jeremy.

This is pure cleanup, no functional change intended.
