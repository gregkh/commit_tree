tty: cleanup prohibition of direct opening for unix98 pty master

cleanup hack added in v2.6.27-3203-g15582d3

comment from that patch:

: pty: If the administrator creates a device for a ptmx slave we should not error
:
: The open path for ptmx slaves is via the ptmx device. Opening them any
: other way is not allowed. Vegard Nossum found that previously this was not
: the case and mknod foo c 128 42; cat foo would produce nasty diagnostics

devpts_get_tty() returns non-null only for inodes on devpts, but there is no
inodes for master-devices, /dev/ptmx (/dev/pts/ptmx) is the only way to open them.
Thus we can completely forbid lookup for master-devices and eliminate that hack in
tty_init_dev() because tty_open() will get EIO from tty_driver_lookup_tty().
