tracing: Fix build breakage without CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS

Today's -next fails to build for me:

  CC      kernel/trace/trace_export.o
In file included from kernel/trace/trace_export.c:197: kernel/trace/trace_entries.h:58: error: 'perf_ftrace_event_register' undeclared here (not in a function)
make[2]: *** [kernel/trace/trace_export.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [kernel/trace] Error 2
make: *** [kernel] Error 2

because as of ced390 (ftrace, perf: Add support to use function
tracepoint in perf) perf_trace_event_register() is declared in trace.h
only if CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS is enabled but I don't have that set.

Ensure that we always have a definition of perf_trace_event_register()
by making the definition unconditional.
