serial: PL011: clear pending interrupts

Chanho Min reported that when the boot loader transfers
control to the kernel, there may be pending interrupts
causing the UART to lock up in an eternal loop trying to
pick tokens from the FIFO (since the RX interrupt flag
indicates there are tokens) while in practice there are
no tokens - in fact there is only a pending IRQ flag.

This patch address the issue with a combination of two
patches suggested by Russell King that clears and mask
all interrupts at probe() and clears any pending error
and RX interrupts at port startup time.

We suspect the spurious interrupts are a side-effect of
switching the UART from FIFO to non-FIFO mode.
