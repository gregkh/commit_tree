staging: r8712u: Fix regression caused by commit 8c213fa

In commit 8c213fa "staging: r8712u: Use asynchronous firmware loading",
the command to release the firmware was placed in the wrong routine.

In combination with the bug introduced in commit a5ee652 "staging: r8712u:
Interface-state not fully tracked", the driver attempts to upload firmware
that had already been released. This bug is the source of one of the
problems in https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/27996#comment89833.
