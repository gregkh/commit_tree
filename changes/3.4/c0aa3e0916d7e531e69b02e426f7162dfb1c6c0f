virtio_blk: helper function to format disk names

The current virtio block's naming algorithm just supports 18278
(26^3 + 26^2 + 26) disks. If there are more virtio blocks,
there will be disks with the same name.

Based on commit 3e1a7ff8a0a7b948f2684930166954f9e8e776fe, add
a function "virtblk_name_format()" for virtio block to support mass
of disks naming.

Notes:
- Our naming scheme is ugly. We are stuck with it
  for virtio but don't use it for any new driver:
  new drivers should name their devices PREFIX%d
  where the sequence number can be allocated by ida
- sd_format_disk_name has exactly the same logic.
  Moving it to a central place was deferred over worries
  that this will make people keep using the legacy naming
  in new drivers.
  We kept code idential in case someone wants to deduplicate later.
