mfd: Convert twl6040 to i2c driver, and separate it from twl core

Complete the separation of the twl6040 from the twl core since
it is a separate chip, not part of the twl6030 PMIC.

Make the needed Kconfig changes for the depending drivers at the
same time to avoid breaking the kernel build (vibra, ASoC components).
