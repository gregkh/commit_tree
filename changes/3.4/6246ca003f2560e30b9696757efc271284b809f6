wl12xx: reset link Tx queues when freeing it

Before, the link was first freed (invalidating it in the map), and later
on vif removal, all valid wlvif-related links were reset. Since these
links were already invalid, we failed to reset them.
The bug was made worse by op_stop, which set the tx_queue_count to 0
arbitrarily. This resulted in a negative tx_queue_count in some scenarios.

Fix this by resetting the Tx-queues of a link when freeing it. Add a
WARN_ON and reset all link Tx-queues in op_stop, to avoid a negative
tx_queue_count.

[changed WARN_ON to WARN_ON_ONCE -- Luca]
