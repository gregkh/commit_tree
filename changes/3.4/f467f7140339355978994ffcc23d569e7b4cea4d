selftests: launch individual selftests from the main Makefile

Remove the run_tests script and launch the selftests by calling "make
run_tests" from the selftests top directory instead.  This delegates to
the Makefile in each selftest directory, where it is decided how to launch
the local test.

This removes the need to add each selftest directory to the now removed
"run_tests" top script.
