ARM: versatile: fix build failure in pci.c

commit 9f786d033d025ab7d2c4d1b959aa81d935eb9e19

    "arm/PCI: get rid of device resource fixups"

causes this failure on the versatile:

arch/arm/mach-versatile/pci.c: In function 'pci_versatile_setup_resources':
arch/arm/mach-versatile/pci.c:221: error: 'sys' undeclared (first use in this function)

because the versatile wasn't passing in the full struct pci_sys_data
but only the resource sub-field.  Change it to pass in the full
struct so that sys will be in scope.
