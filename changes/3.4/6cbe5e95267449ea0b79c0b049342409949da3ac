openrisc: sanitize use of orig_gpr11

The pt_regs struct had both a 'syscallno' field and an 'orig_gpr11' field
and it wasn't really clear how these were supposed to be used.  This patch
removes the syscallno field altogether and makes orig_gpr11 work more
like other architectures: keep track of syscall number in progress or
hold -1 for non-syscall exceptions.
