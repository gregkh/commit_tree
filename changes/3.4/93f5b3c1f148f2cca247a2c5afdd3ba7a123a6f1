ixgbe: Modify setup of descriptor flags to avoid conditional jumps

This change makes it more likely that the descriptor flags setup will use
cmov instructions instead of conditional jumps when setting up the flags.
The advantage to this is that the code should just flow a bit more
smoothly.

To do this it is necessary to set the TX_FLAGS_CSUM bit in tx_flags when
doing TSO so that we also do the checksum in addition to the segmentation
offload.
