ARM: tegra: Fix device tree AUXDATA for USB/EHCI

Commit 4a53f4e "USB: ehci-tegra: add probing through device tree" added
AUXDATA for Tegra's USB/EHCI controller. However, it pointed the platform
data at a location containing the address of the intended platform data,
rather than the platform data itself. This change fixes that.
