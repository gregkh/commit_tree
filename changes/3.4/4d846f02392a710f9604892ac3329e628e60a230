tcp: fix tcp_grow_window() for large incoming frames

tcp_grow_window() has to grow rcv_ssthresh up to window_clamp, allowing
sender to increase its window.

tcp_grow_window() still assumes a tcp frame is under MSS, but its no
longer true with LRO/GRO.

This patch fixes one of the performance issue we noticed with GRO on.
