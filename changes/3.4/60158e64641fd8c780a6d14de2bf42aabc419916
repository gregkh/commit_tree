cxgb3: Don't call cxgb_vlan_mode until q locks are initialized

The driver calls cxgb_vlan_mode() from init_one().  This calls into
synchronize_rx(), which locks all the q locks, but the q locks are not
initialized until cxgb_up() -> setup_sge_qsets().  So move the call to
cxgb_vlan_mode() into cxgb_up(), after the call to setup_sge_qsets().
We also move the body of these functions up higher to avoid having to
a forward declaration.

This was found because of the lockdep warning:

    INFO: trying to register non-static key.
    the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
    turning off the locking correctness validator.

Contrary to what lockdep says, the code is not fine: we are locking an
uninitialized spinlock.
