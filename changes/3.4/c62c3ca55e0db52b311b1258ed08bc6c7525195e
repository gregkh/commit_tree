i2c-s3c2410: Add stub runtime power management

Add stub runtime_pm calls which go through the flow of enabling and
disabling but don't actually do anything with the device itself as
there's nothing useful we can do. This provides the core PM framework
with information about when the device is idle, enabling chip wide
power savings.
