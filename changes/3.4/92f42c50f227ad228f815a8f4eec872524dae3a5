x86, efi: Fix endian issues and unaligned accesses

We may need to convert the endianness of the data we read from/write
to 'buf', so let's use {get,put}_unaligned_le32() to do that. Failure
to do so can result in accessing invalid memory, leading to a
segfault.  Stephen Rothwell noticed this bug while cross-building an
x86_64 allmodconfig kernel on PowerPC.

We need to read from and write to 'buf' a byte at a time otherwise
it's possible we'll perform an unaligned access, which can lead to bus
errors when cross-building an x86 kernel on risc architectures.
