KVM: SVM: Add support for AMD's OSVW feature in guests

In some cases guests should not provide workarounds for errata even when the
physical processor is affected. For example, because of erratum 400 on family
10h processors a Linux guest will read an MSR (resulting in VMEXIT) before
going to idle in order to avoid getting stuck in a non-C0 state. This is not
necessary: HLT and IO instructions are intercepted and therefore there is no
reason for erratum 400 workaround in the guest.

This patch allows us to present a guest with certain errata as fixed,
regardless of the state of actual hardware.
