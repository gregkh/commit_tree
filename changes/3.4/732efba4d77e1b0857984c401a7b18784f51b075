tipc: nuke the delimit static inline function.

This "shortform" is actually longer than typing out what it is really
trying to do, and just makes reading the code more difficult, so
lets simply shoot it in the head.

In the case of log.c - the comparison is on a u32, so we can drop the
check for < 0 at the same time.
