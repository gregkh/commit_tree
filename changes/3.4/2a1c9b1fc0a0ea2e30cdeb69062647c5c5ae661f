mm, oom: avoid looping when chosen thread detaches its mm

oom_kill_task() returns non-zero iff the chosen process does not have any
threads with an attached ->mm.

In such a case, it's better to just return to the page allocator and retry
the allocation because memory could have been freed in the interim and the
oom condition may no longer exist.  It's unnecessary to loop in the oom
killer and find another thread to kill.

This allows both oom_kill_task() and oom_kill_process() to be converted to
void functions.  If the oom condition persists, the oom killer will be
recalled.
