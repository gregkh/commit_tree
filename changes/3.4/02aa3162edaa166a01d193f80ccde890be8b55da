ftrace: Allow to specify filter field type for ftrace events

Adding FILTER_TRACE_FN event field type for function tracepoint
event, so it can be properly recognized within filtering code.

Currently all fields of ftrace subsystem events share the common
field type FILTER_OTHER. Since the function trace fields need
special care within the filtering code we need to recognize it
properly, hence adding the FILTER_TRACE_FN event type.

Adding filter parameter to the FTRACE_ENTRY macro, to specify the
filter field type for the event.
