ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Revert "ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Make omap_hwmod_softreset wait for reset status"

This reverts commit f9a2f9c3fa76eec55928e8e06f3094c8f01df7cb.  This
commit caused a regression in the I2C hwmod reset on OMAP2/3/4,
logging messages similar to these during boot:

[    0.200378] omap_hwmod: i2c1: softreset failed (waited 10000 usec)
[    0.222076] omap_hwmod: i2c2: softreset failed (waited 10000 usec)

While the original patch was intended to fix some reset-related timing
issues, it's believed that these problems were actually fixed by
commit 2800852a079504f35f88e44faf5c9c96318c0cca ("ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod:
Restore sysc after a reset"):
