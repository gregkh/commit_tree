e1000e: pass pointer to hw struct for e1000_init_mac_params_XXX()

The e1000_init_mac_params_XXX() functions (where XXX is one of the three
MAC-family types 80003es2lan, 82571 and ich8lan) was not meant to require a
pointer to the adapter struct but does require a pointer to the hw struct.
Pass that pointer in to the functions instead.
