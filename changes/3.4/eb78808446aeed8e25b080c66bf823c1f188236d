ceph: use macros to normalize vxattr table definitions

Entries in the ceph virtual extended attribute tables all follow a
distinct pattern in their definition.  Enforce this pattern through
the use of a macro.

Also, a null name field signals the end of the table, so make that
be the first field in the ceph_vxattr_cb structure.
