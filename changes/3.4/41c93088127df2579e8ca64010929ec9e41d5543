Revert "mm: vmscan: fix misused nr_reclaimed in shrink_mem_cgroup_zone()"

This reverts commit c38446cc65e1f2b3eb8630c53943b94c4f65f670.

Before the commit, the code makes senses to me but not after the commit.
The "nr_reclaimed" is the number of pages reclaimed by scanning through
the memcg's lru lists.  The "nr_to_reclaim" is the target value for the
whole function.  For example, we like to early break the reclaim if
reclaimed 32 pages under direct reclaim (not DEF_PRIORITY).

After the reverted commit, the target "nr_to_reclaim" is decremented each
time by "nr_reclaimed" but we still use it to compare the "nr_reclaimed".
It just doesn't make sense to me...
