PM / Hibernate: fix the number of pages used for hibernate/thaw buffering

Hibernation regression fix, since 3.2.

Calculate the number of required free pages based on non-high memory
pages only, because that is where the buffers will come from.

Commit 081a9d043c983f161b78fdc4671324d1342b86bc introduced a new buffer
page allocation logic during hibernation, in order to improve the
performance. The amount of pages allocated was calculated based on total
amount of pages available, although only non-high memory pages are
usable for this purpose. This caused hibernation code to attempt to over
allocate pages on platforms that have high memory, which led to hangs.
