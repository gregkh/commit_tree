ext4: do not mark superblock as dirty unnecessarily

Commit a0375156ca1041574b5d47cc7e32f10b891151b0 cleaned up superblock
dirtying handling, but missed one place. This patch does what was
intended: if we have the journal, then we update the superblock
through the journal rather than doing this directly.
