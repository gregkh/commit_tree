cifs: fix issue mounting of DFS ROOT when redirecting from one domain controller to the next

This patch fixes an issue when cifs_mount receives a
STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME error during cifs_get_tcon but is able to
continue after an DFS ROOT referral. In this case, the return code
variable is not reset prior to trying to mount from the system referred
to. Thus, is_path_accessible is not executed and the final DFS referral
is not performed causing a mount error.

Use case: In DNS, example.com  resolves to the secondary AD server
ad2.example.com Our primary domain controller is ad1.example.com and has
a DFS redirection set up from \\ad1\share\Users to \\files\share\Users.
Mounting \\example.com\share\Users fails.

Regression introduced by commit 724d9f1.
