md: don't call ->add_disk unless there is good reason.

Commit 7bfec5f35c68121e7b18

   md/raid5: If there is a spare and a want_replacement device, start replacement.

cause md_check_recovery to call ->add_disk much more often.
Instead of only when the array is degraded, it is now called whenever
md_check_recovery finds anything useful to do, which includes
updating the metadata for clean<->dirty transition.
This causes unnecessary work, and causes info messages from ->add_disk
to be reported much too often.

So refine md_check_recovery to only do any actual recovery checking
(including ->add_disk) if MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED is set.

This fix is suitable for 3.3.y:
