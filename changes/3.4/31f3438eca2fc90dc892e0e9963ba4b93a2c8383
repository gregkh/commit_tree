KVM: PPC: Move kvm_vcpu_ioctl_[gs]et_one_reg down to platform-specific code

This moves the get/set_one_reg implementation down from powerpc.c into
booke.c, book3s_pr.c and book3s_hv.c.  This avoids #ifdefs in C code,
but more importantly, it fixes a bug on Book3s HV where we were
accessing beyond the end of the kvm_vcpu struct (via the to_book3s()
macro) and corrupting memory, causing random crashes and file corruption.

On Book3s HV we only accept setting the HIOR to zero, since the guest
runs in supervisor mode and its vectors are never offset from zero.
