kdb: Fix smatch warning on dbg_io_ops->is_console

The Smatch tool warned that the change from commit b8adde8dd
(kdb: Avoid using dbg_io_ops until it is initialized) should
add another null check later in the kdb_printf().

It is worth noting that the second use of dbg_io_ops->is_console
is protected by the KDB_PAGER state variable which would only
get set when kdb is fully active and initialized.  If we
ever encounter changes or defects in the KDB_PAGER state
we do not want to crash the kernel in a kdb_printf/printk.
