ioat: fix size of 'completion' for Xen

Starting with v3.2 Jonathan reports that Xen crashes loading the ioatdma
driver.  A debug run shows:

  ioatdma 0000:00:16.4: desc[0]: (0x300cc7000->0x300cc7040) cookie: 0 flags: 0x2 ctl: 0x29 (op: 0 int_en: 1 compl: 1)
  ...
  ioatdma 0000:00:16.4: ioat_get_current_completion: phys_complete: 0xcc7000

...which shows that in this environment GFP_KERNEL memory may be backed
by a 64-bit dma address.  This breaks the driver's assumption that an
unsigned long should be able to contain the physical address for
descriptor memory.  Switch to dma_addr_t which beyond being the right
size, is the true type for the data i.e. an io-virtual address
inidicating the engine's last processed descriptor.
