powerpc/eeh: Introduce struct eeh_stats for EEH

With the original EEH implementation, the EEH global statistics
are maintained by individual global variables. That makes the
code a little hard to maintain.

The patch introduces extra struct eeh_stats for the EEH global
statistics so that it can be maintained in collective fashion.

It's the rework on the corresponding v5 patch. According to
the comments from David Laight, the EEH global statistics have
been changed for a litte bit so that they have fixed-type of
"u64". Also, the format used to print them has been changed to
"%llu" based on David's suggestion. Also, the output format of
EEH global statistics should be kept as intacted according to
Michael's suggestion that there might be tools parsing them.
