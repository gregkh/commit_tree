ptrace: renumber PTRACE_EVENT_STOP so that future new options and events can match

PTRACE_EVENT_foo and PTRACE_O_TRACEfoo used to match.

New PTRACE_EVENT_STOP is the first event which has no corresponding
PTRACE_O_TRACE option.  If we will ever want to add another such option,
its PTRACE_EVENT's value will collide with PTRACE_EVENT_STOP's value.

This patch changes PTRACE_EVENT_STOP value to prevent this.

While at it, added a comment - the one atop PTRACE_EVENT block, saying
"Wait extended result codes for the above trace options", is not true
for PTRACE_EVENT_STOP.
