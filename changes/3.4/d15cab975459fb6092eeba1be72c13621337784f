swapon: check validity of swap_flags

Most system calls taking flags first check that the flags passed in are
valid, and that helps userspace to detect when new flags are supported.

But swapon never did so: start checking now, to help if we ever want to
support more swap_flags in future.

It's difficult to get stray bits set in an int, and swapon is not widely
used, so this is most unlikely to break any userspace; but we can just
revert if it turns out to do so.
