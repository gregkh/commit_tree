ACPI video: Don't start video device until its associated input device has been allocated

Quoth Dmitry Torokhov:
In addition to bus notifier we do install device notifier explicitly
so it might fire up early. The easiest fox would be to move
acpi_video_bus_start_devices() after input_allocate_device() but
before input_register_device() - unregistered input devices can handle
input_event() calls just fine.
