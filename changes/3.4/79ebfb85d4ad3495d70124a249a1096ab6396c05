mac80211: fix associated vs. idle race

Eliad reports that if a scan finishes in the
middle of processing associated (however it
happens), the interface can go idle. This is
because we set assoc_data to NULL before we
set associated. Change the order so any idle
check will find either one of them.

Doing this requires duplicating the TX sync
processing, but I already have a patch to
delete that completely and will submit that
as soon as my driver changes to no longer
require it are submitted.
