igbvf: refactor Interrupt Throttle Rate code

The existing ITR code is broken and confusing, with lots of similarly-named
variables that do different things. Additionally, after the driver carefully
determines the optimal interrupt rate for the adapter, it then
ignores it and always writes a fixed, suboptimal value.

This patch refactors that code to make variable names more descriptive of
what they actually do, and then actually writes the calculated result to
the hardware.

Preliminary testing shows that netperf TCP_STREAM tests goes from ~918Mbps
to ~940Mbps, and TCP_RR goes from ~2k transactions/sec up to > 8k.
