xhci: Restore event ring dequeue pointer on resume.

The xhci_save_registers() function saved the event ring dequeue pointer
in the s3 register structure, but xhci_restore_registers() never
restored it.  No other code in the xHCI successful resume path would
ever restore it either.  Fix that.

This should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.37, that contain the
commit 5535b1d5f8885695c6ded783c692e3c0d0eda8ca "USB: xHCI: PCI power
management implementation".
