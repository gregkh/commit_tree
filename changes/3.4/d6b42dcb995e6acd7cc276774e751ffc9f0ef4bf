md/raid1,raid10: avoid deadlock during resync/recovery.

If RAID1 or RAID10 is used under LVM or some other stacking
block device, it is possible to enter a deadlock during
resync or recovery.
This can happen if the upper level block device creates
two requests to the RAID1 or RAID10.  The first request gets
processed, blocks recovery and queue requests for underlying
requests in current->bio_list.  A resync request then starts
which will wait for those requests and block new IO.

But then the second request to the RAID1/10 will be attempted
and it cannot progress until the resync request completes,
which cannot progress until the underlying device requests complete,
which are on a queue behind that second request.

So allow that second request to proceed even though there is
a resync request about to start.

This is suitable for any -stable kernel.
