Delete the __FD_*() funcs for operating on fd_set from linux/time.h

Delete the __FD_*() functions for operating on fd_set structs from
linux/time.h as they're no longer used within the kernel with the preceding
patch and are not exported to userspace.

Whilst linux/time.h *does* export the FD_*() equivalents as wrappers around
__FD_*(), userspace provides its own definition of __FD_*().

Note that the definition of FD_ZERO() in linux/time.h may not be used with the
fd_sets associated with struct fdtable as the fd_set may have been allocated in
a truncated fashion.
