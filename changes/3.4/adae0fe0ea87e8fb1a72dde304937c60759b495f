SUNRPC: register PipeFS file system after pernet sybsystem

PipeFS superblock creation routine relays on SUNRPC pernet data presense, which
is created on register_pernet_subsys() call in SUNRPC module init function.
Registering of PipeFS filesystem prior to registering of per-net subsystem
leads to races (mount of PipeFS can dereference uninitialized data).
