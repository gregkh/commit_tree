ALSA: hda/realtek - Rewrite ALC880 model=lg with the auto-parser

ALC880 model=lg could work fine with the auto-parser due to the recent
rewrite, but it still needs the manual adjustment; namely, the BIOS leaves
unused pins as some real active jacks.  This confuses the parser.
Thus we just cover these pins and override the pin-configs as a fix-up.
