pch_uart: Fix dma channel unallocated issue

This driver anticipates pch_uart_verify_port() is not called
during installation.
However, actually pch_uart_verify_port() is called during
installation.
As a result, memory access violation occurs like below.

0. initial value: use_dma=0
1. starup()
    - dma channel is not allocated because use_dma=0
2. pch_uart_verify_port()
    - Set use_dma=1
3. UART processing acts DMA mode because use_dma=1
     - memory access violation occurs!

This patch fixes the issue.

Solution:
Whenever pch_uart_verify_port() is called and then
dma channel is not allocated, the channel should be allocated.
