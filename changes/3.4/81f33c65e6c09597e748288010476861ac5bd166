PCMCIA: sa1111: use new per-socket irq/gpio infrastructure

Convert sa1111 PCMCIA drivers to use the new per-socket irq/gpio
infrastructure.  As the core takes care of handling the IRQs, we
can get rid of sa1111_pcmcia_socket_init(), sa1111_pcmcia_socket_suspend(),
sa1111_pcmcia_hw_init() and sa1111_pcmcia_hw_shutdown(), as well
as the private IRQ table.

We remove the NCR_0 setting in Neponset, as this is duplicating
what's already done via configure_socket in suspend.
