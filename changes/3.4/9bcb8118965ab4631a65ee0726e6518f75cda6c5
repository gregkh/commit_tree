ACPI: Evaluate thermal trip points before reading temperature

An HP laptop (Pavilion G4-1016tx) has the following code in _TMP:

       Store (\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC0.RTMP, Local0)
       If (LGreaterEqual (Local0, S4TP))
       {
           Store (One, HTS4)
       }

S4TP is initialised at 0 and not programmed further until either _HOT or
_CRT is called. If we evaluate _TMP before the trip points then HTS4 will
always be set, causing the firmware to generate a message on boot
complaining that the system shut down because of overheating. The simplest
solution is just to reverse the checking of trip points and _TMP in thermal
init.
