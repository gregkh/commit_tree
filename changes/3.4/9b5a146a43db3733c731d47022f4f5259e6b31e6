ARM: 7338/1: add support for early console output via semihosting

This is a very simple method for code running in an emulator, or under
the supervision of a debugger, to use I/O facilities on the controlling
host.

Tested with OpenOCD, and ARM's Fast Models.

Details on semihosting can be found in chapter 8 of
DUI0203I_rvct_developer_guide.pdf from ARM Ltd.
