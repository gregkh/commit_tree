dm thin metadata: pass correct space map to dm_sm_root_size

Fix a harmless typo.

The root is a chunk of data that gets written to the superblock.  This
data is used to recreate the space map when opening a metadata area.
We have two space maps; one tracking space on the metadata device and
one of the data device.  Both of these use the same format for their
root, so this typo was harmless.
