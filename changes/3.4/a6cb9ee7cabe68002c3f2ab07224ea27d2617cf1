PCI: Retry BARs restoration for Type 0 headers only

Some shortcomings introduced into pci_restore_state() by commit
26f41062f28d ("PCI: check for pci bar restore completion and retry")
have been fixed by recent commit ebfc5b802fa76 ("PCI: Fix regression in
pci_restore_state(), v3"), but that commit treats all PCI devices as
those with Type 0 configuration headers.

That is not entirely correct, because Type 1 and Type 2 headers have
different layouts.  In particular, the area occupied by BARs in Type 0
config headers contains the secondary status register in Type 1 ones and
it doesn't make sense to retry the restoration of that register even if
the value read back from it after a write is not the same as the written
one (it very well may be different).

For this reason, make pci_restore_state() only retry the restoration
of BARs for Type 0 config headers.  This effectively makes it behave
as before commit 26f41062f28d for all header types except for Type 0.
