staging: zram: Rename module parameter

zram accepts number of devices to be created
as a module parameter. This was renamed from
num_devices to zram_num_devices (without updating
the documentation!) since num_devices was declared
as a non-static global variable, polluting the global
namespace. Now, we declare it as a static variable
and revert back the name change.

The documentation (zram.txt) already mentions
num_devices as the module parameter name.
