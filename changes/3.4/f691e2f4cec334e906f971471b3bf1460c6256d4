drm/i915: swizzling support for snb/ivb

We have to do this manually. Somebody had a Great Idea.

I've measured speed-ups just a few percent above the noise level
(below 5% for the best case), but no slowdows. Chris Wilson measured
quite a bit more (10-20% above the usual snb variance) on a more
recent and better tuned version of sna, but also recorded a few
slow-downs on benchmarks know for uglier amounts of snb-induced
variance.

v2: Incorporate Ben Widawsky's preliminary review comments and
elaborate a bit about the performance impact in the changelog.

v3: Add a comment as to why we don't need to check the 3rd memory
channel.

v4: Fixup whitespace.
