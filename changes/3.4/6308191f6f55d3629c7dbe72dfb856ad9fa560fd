tracing, sched, vfs: Fix 'old_pid' usage in trace_sched_process_exec()

1. TRACE_EVENT(sched_process_exec) forgets to actually use the
   old pid argument, it sets ->old_pid = p->pid.

2. search_binary_handler() uses the wrong pid number. tracepoint
   needs the global pid_t from the root namespace, while old_pid
   is the virtual pid number as it seen by the tracer/parent.

With this patch we have two pid_t's in search_binary_handler(),
not really nice. Perhaps we should switch to "struct pid*", but
in this case it would be better to cleanup the current code
first and move the "depth == 0" code outside.
