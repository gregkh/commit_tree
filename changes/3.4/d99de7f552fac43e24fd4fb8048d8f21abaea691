ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: add softreset delay field and OMAP4 data

Due to HW limitation, some IPs should not be accessed just after a
softreset. Since the current hwmod sequence is accessing the sysconfig
register just after the reset, it might lead to OCP bus error in
that case.

Add a new field in the sysconfig structure to specify a delay in usecs
needed after doing a softreset.

In the case of the ISS and FDIF modules, the L3 OCP port will be
disconnected upon a SW reset. That issue was confirmed with HW simulation
and an errata should be available soon. The HW recommendation to avoid
that is to wait for 100 OCP clk cycles, before accessing the IP.

Considering the worse case (OPP50), the L3 bus will run at 100 MHz,
so a 1 usec delay is needed. Add an x2 margin to be safe.

[paul@pwsan.com: dropped FDIF change for now since the hwmod data is not
 yet upstream; the FDIF change will need to be added later once the FDIF
 data is merged]
