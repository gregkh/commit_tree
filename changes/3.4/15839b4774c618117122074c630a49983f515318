To get rid of things like:

arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_hwperf.c:1002:1: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_hwperf.c:1002:1: warning: type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'EXPORT_SYMBOL'
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_hwperf.c:1002:1: warning: parameter names (without types) in function declaration
