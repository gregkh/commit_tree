ixgbe: Let the Rx buffer allocation clear status bits instead of cleanup

This change makes it so that we always clear the status/error bits in the
Rx descriptor in the allocation path instead of the cleanup path.  The
advantage to this is that we spend less time modifying data.  As such we
can modify the data once and then let it go cold in the cache instead of
writing it, reading it, and then writing it again.
