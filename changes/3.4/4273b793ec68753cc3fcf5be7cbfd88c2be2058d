fuse: O_DIRECT support for files

Implement ->direct_IO() method in aops. The ->direct_IO() method combines
the existing fuse_direct_read/fuse_direct_write methods to implement
O_DIRECT functionality.

Reaching ->direct_IO() in the read path via generic_file_aio_read ensures
proper synchronization with page cache with its existing framework.

Reaching ->direct_IO() in the write path via fuse_file_aio_write is made
to come via generic_file_direct_write() which makes it play nice with
the page cache w.r.t other mmap pages etc.

On files marked 'direct_io' by the filesystem server, IO always follows
the fuse_direct_read/write path. There is no effect of fcntl(O_DIRECT)
and it always succeeds.

On files not marked with 'direct_io' by the filesystem server, the IO
path depends on O_DIRECT flag by the application. This can be passed
at the time of open() as well as via fcntl().

Note that asynchronous O_DIRECT iocb jobs are completed synchronously
always (this has been the case with FUSE even before this patch)
