xfs: use common code for quota statistics

Switch the quota code over to use the generic XFS statistics infrastructure.
While the legacy /proc/fs/xfs/xqm and /proc/fs/xfs/xqmstats interfaces are
preserved for now the statistics that still have a meaning with the current
code are now also available from /proc/fs/xfs/stats.
