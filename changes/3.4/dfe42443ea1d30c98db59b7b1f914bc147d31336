serial: reduce number of indirections in 8250 code

The serial_8250_port struct contains within a serial_port struct
and many times one or the other, or both are in scope within
functions via a passed in arg, or via container_of.

However there are a lot of cases where we have access directly
to the port pointer, but yet go through the parent 8250_port
structure instead to get it.  These should just use the port
struct directly.

Similarly there are cases where it makes sense (from a code
cleanliness point of view) to declare a local for the port
struct, so we aren't going through the parent 8250_port struct
repeatedly to get to it.

We get a small reduction in text size, but it appears that
gcc was smart enough to internally be doing most of this
already, so the readability improvement is the larger gain.
