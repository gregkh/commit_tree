drm: base prime/dma-buf support (v5)

This adds the basic drm dma-buf interface layer, called PRIME. This
commit doesn't add any driver support, it is simply and agreed upon starting
point so we can work towards merging driver support for the next merge window.

Current drivers with work done are nouveau, i915, udl, exynos and omap.

The main APIs exposed to userspace allow translating a 32-bit object handle
to a file descriptor, and a file descriptor to a 32-bit object handle.

The flags value is currently limited to O_CLOEXEC.

Acknowledgements:
Daniel Vetter: lots of review
Rob Clark: cleaned up lots of the internals and did lifetime review.

v2: rename some functions after Chris preferred a green shed
fix IS_ERR_OR_NULL -> IS_ERR
v3: Fix Ville pointed out using buffer + kmalloc
v4: add locking as per ickle review
v5: allow re-exporting the original dma-buf (Daniel)
