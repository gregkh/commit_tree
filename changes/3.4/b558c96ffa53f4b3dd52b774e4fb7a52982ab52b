dynamic_debug: make dynamic-debug supersede DEBUG ccflag

If CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG is defined, honor it over DEBUG, so that
pr_debug()s are controllable, instead of always-on.  When DEBUG is
also defined, change _DPRINTK_FLAGS_DEFAULT to enable printing by
default.

Also adding _DPRINTK_FLAGS_INCL_MODNAME would be nice, but there are
numerous cases of pr_debug(NAME ": ...), which would result in double
printing of module-name.  So defer this until things settle.
