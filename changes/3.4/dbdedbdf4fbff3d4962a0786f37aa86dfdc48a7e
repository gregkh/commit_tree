b43: only reload config after successful initialization

Commit 2a19032 (b43: reload phy and bss settings after core restarts)
introduced an unconditional call to b43_op_config() at the end of
b43_op_start(). When firmware fails to load this can wedge the system.
There's no need to reload the configuration after a failed
initialization anyway, so only make the call if initialization was
successful.
