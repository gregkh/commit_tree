MFD: ucb1x00: convert to use genirq

Convert the ucb1x00 driver to use genirq's interrupt services, rather
than its own private implementation.  This allows a wider range of
drivers to use the GPIO interrupts (such as the gpio_keys driver)
without being aware of the UCB1x00's private IRQ system.

This prevents the UCB1x00 core driver from being built as a module,
so adjust the configuration to add that restriction.
