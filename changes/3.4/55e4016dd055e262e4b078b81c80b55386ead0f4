serial: remove back and forth conversions in serial_out_sync

The two callers to serial_out_sync() have a struct port right
there in scope, but then pass in a struct 8250_port which then
is locally resolved back to a struct port.

Delete the needless back and forth and just pass in the struct
port directly.  Rename the function to have "_port" in its
name, so the name <--> args relationship is consistent with the
other serial_in/out vs serial_port_in/out function classes.
