powerpc/8xxx: remove 85xx/86xx restrictions from fsl_guts.h

Remove the check for CONFIG_PPC_85xx and CONFIG_PPC_86xx from fsl_guts.h.
The check was originally intended to allow the same header file to
be used on 85xx and 86xx systems, even though the Global Utilities
register could be different.  It turns out that they're not actually
different, and so the check is not necessary.  In addition, neither
macro is defined for 64-bit e5500 kernels, so that causes a build
break.
