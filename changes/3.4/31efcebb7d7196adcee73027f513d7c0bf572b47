um: fix races between line_open() and line_config()

Pull parse_chan_pair() call into setup_one_line(), under the mutex.
We really don't want open() to succeed before parse_chan_pair() had
been done (or after it has failed, BTW).  We also want "remove con<n>"
to free irqs, etc., same as "config con<n>=none".
