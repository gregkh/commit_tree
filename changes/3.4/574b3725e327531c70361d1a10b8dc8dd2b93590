dynamic_debug: factor vpr_info_dq out of ddebug_parse_query

Factor pr_info(query) out of ddebug_parse_query, into vpr_info_dq(),
for reuse later.  Also change the printed labels: file, func to agree
with the query-spec keywords accepted in the control file.  Pass ""
when string is null, to avoid "(null)" output from sprintf.  For
format print, use precision to skip last char, assuming its '\n', no
great harm if not, its a debug msg.
