perf: Fix perf_event_for_each() to use sibling

In perf_event_for_each() we call a function on an event, and then
iterate over the siblings of the event.

However we don't call the function on the siblings, we call it
repeatedly on the original event - it seems "obvious" that we should
be calling it with sibling as the argument.

It looks like this broke in commit 75f937f24bd9 ("Fix ctx->mutex
vs counter->mutex inversion").

The only effect of the bug is that the PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP parameter
to the ioctls doesn't work.
