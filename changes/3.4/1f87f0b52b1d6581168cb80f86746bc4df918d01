sysctl: Move the implementation into fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c

Move the core sysctl code from kernel/sysctl.c and kernel/sysctl_check.c
into fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c.

Currently sysctl maintenance is hampered by the sysctl implementation
being split across 3 files with artificial layering between them.
Consolidate the entire sysctl implementation into 1 file so that
it is easier to see what is going on and hopefully allowing for
simpler maintenance.

For functions that are now only used in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c remove
their declarations from sysctl.h and make them static in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c
