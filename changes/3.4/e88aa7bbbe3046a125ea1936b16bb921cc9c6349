Fix modpost failures in fedora 17

The symbol table on x86-64 starts to have entries that have names
like:

_GLOBAL__sub_I_65535_0___mod_x86cpu_device_table

They are of type STT_FUNCTION and this one had a length of 18.  This
matched the device ID validation logic and it barfed because the
length did not meet the device type's criteria.

--------------------
FATAL: arch/x86/crypto/aesni-intel: sizeof(struct x86cpu_device_id)=16 is not a modulo of the size of section __mod_x86cpu_device_table=18.
Fix definition of struct x86cpu_device_id in mod_devicetable.h
--------------------

These are some kind of compiler tool internal stuff being emitted and
not something we want to inspect in modpost's device ID table
validation code.

So skip the symbol if it is not of type STT_OBJECT.
