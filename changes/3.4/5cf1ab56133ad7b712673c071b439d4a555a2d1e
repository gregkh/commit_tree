Btrfs: always store the mirror we read the eb from

A user reported a panic where we were trying to fix a bad mirror but the
mirror number we were giving was 0, which is invalid.  This is because we
don't do the transid verification until after the read, so as far as the
read code is concerned the read was a success.  So instead store the mirror
we read from so that if there is some failure post read we know which mirror
to try next and which mirror needs to be fixed if we find a good copy of the
block.  Thanks,
