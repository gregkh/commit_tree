NFS: Fix nfs4_verifier memory alignment

Clean up due to code review.

The nfs4_verifier's data field is not guaranteed to be u32-aligned.
Casting an array of chars to a u32 * is considered generally
hazardous.

Fix this by using a __be32 array to generate a verifier's contents,
and then byte-copy the contents into the verifier field.  The contents
of a verifier, for all intents and purposes, are opaque bytes.  Only
local code that generates a verifier need know the actual content and
format.  Everyone else compares the full byte array for exact
equality.

Also, sizeof(nfs4_verifer) is the size of the in-core verifier data
structure, but NFS4_VERIFIER_SIZE is the number of octets in an XDR'd
verifier.  The two are not interchangeable, even if they happen to
have the same value.
