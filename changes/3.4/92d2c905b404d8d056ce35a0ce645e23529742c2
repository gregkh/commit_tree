tipc: Prevent transmission of outdated link protocol messages

Ensures that a link endpoint discards any previously deferred link
protocol message whenever it attempts to send a new one.

Previously, it was possible for a link protocol message that was unsent
due to congestion to be transmitted after newer protocol messages had
been sent. The stale link protocol message might then cause the receiving
link endpoint to malfunction because of its outdated conent.

Thanks to Osamu Kaminuma [okaminum@avaya.com] for diagnosing the problem
and contributing a prototype patch.
