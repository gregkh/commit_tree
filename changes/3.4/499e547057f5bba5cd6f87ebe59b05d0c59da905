tracing/ring-buffer: Only have tracing_on disable tracing buffers

As the ring-buffer code is being used by other facilities in the
kernel, having tracing_on file disable *all* buffers is not a desired
affect. It should only disable the ftrace buffers that are being used.

Move the code into the trace.c file and use the buffer disabling
for tracing_on() and tracing_off(). This way only the ftrace buffers
will be affected by them and other kernel utilities will not be
confused to why their output suddenly stopped.
