scripts/Kbuild.include: Fix portability problem of "echo -e"

"echo -e" is a GNU extension. When cross-compiling the kernel on a
BSD-like operating system (Mac OS X in my case), this doesn't work.

One could install a GNU version of echo, put that in the $PATH before
the system echo and use "/usr/bin/env echo", but the solution with
printf is simpler.

Since it is no disadvantage on Linux, I hope that gets accepted even if
cross-compiling the Linux kernel on another Unix operating system is
quite a rare use case.
