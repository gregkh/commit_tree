target: Fix bug in handling of FILEIO + block_device resize ops

This patch fixes a bug in the handling of FILEIO w/ underlying block_device
resize operations where the original fd_dev->fd_dev_size was incorrectly being
used in fd_get_blocks() for READ_CAPACITY response payloads.

This patch avoids using fd_dev->fd_dev_size for FILEIO devices with
an underlying block_device, and instead changes fd_get_blocks() to
get the sector count directly from i_size_read() as recommended by hch.
