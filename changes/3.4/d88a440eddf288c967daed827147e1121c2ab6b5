dac960: Remove unused variables from DAC960_CreateProcEntries()

The variables 'StatusProcEntry' and 'UserCommandProcEntry' are
assigned to once and then never used. This patch gets rid of the
variables.

While I was there I also fixed the indentation of the function to use
tabs rather than spaces for the lines that did not already do so.
