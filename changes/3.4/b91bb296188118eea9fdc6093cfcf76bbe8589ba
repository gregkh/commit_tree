[SCSI] libsas: use ->set_dmamode to notify lldds of NCQ parameters

sas_discover_sata() notifies lldds of sata devices twice.  Once to allow
the 'identify' to be sent, and a second time to allow aic94xx (the only
libsas driver that cares about sata_dev.identify) to setup NCQ
parameters before the device becomes known to the midlayer.  Replace
this double notification and intervening 'identify' with an explicit
->lldd_ata_set_dmamode notification.  With this change all ata internal
commands are issued by libata, so we no longer need sas_issue_ata_cmd().

The data from the identify command only needs to be cached in one
location so ata_device.id replaces domain_device.sata_dev.identify.
