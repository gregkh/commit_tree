HWPOISON: Clean up memory_failure() vs. __memory_failure()

There is only one caller of memory_failure(), all other users call
__memory_failure() and pass in the flags argument explicitly. The
lone user of memory_failure() will soon need to pass flags too.

Add flags argument to the callsite in mce.c. Delete the old memory_failure()
function, and then rename __memory_failure() without the leading "__".

Provide clearer message when action optional memory errors are ignored.
