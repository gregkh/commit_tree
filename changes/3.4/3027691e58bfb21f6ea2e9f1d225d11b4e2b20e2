powerpc/pmac: Don't add_timer() twice

If the interrupt and the timeout happen roughly at the same
time, we can get into a situation where the timer function
is run while the interrupt has already been processed. In
this case, the timer function might end up doing an add_timer
on an already pending timer, causing a BUG_ON() to trigger.

Instead, just skip the whole timeout operation if we see that
the timer is pending. The spinlock ensures that the only way
that happens is if we already started a new operation and thus
the timeout can be ignored.
