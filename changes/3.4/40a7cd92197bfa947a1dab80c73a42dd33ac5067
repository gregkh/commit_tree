powerpc/eeh: Replace pci_dn with eeh_dev for EEH aux components

The original EEH implementation is heavily depending on struct pci_dn.
We have to put EEH related information to pci_dn. Actually, we could
split struct pci_dn so that the EEH sensitive information to form an
individual struct, then EEH looks more independent.

The patch replaces pci_dn with eeh_dev for EEH aux components like
event and driver. Also, the eeh_event struct has been adjusted for
a little bit since eeh_dev has linked the associated FDT (Flat Device
Tree) node and PCI device. It's not necessary for eeh_event struct to
trace FDT node and PCI device. We can just simply to trace eeh_dev in
eeh_event.

The patch also renames function pcid_name() to eeh_pcid_name(), which
should be missed in the previous patch where the EEH aux components
have been cleaned up.
