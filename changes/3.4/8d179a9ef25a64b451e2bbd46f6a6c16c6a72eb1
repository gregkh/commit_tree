HID: handle all multitouch devices through hid-multitouch

When the quirk HID_QUIRK_MULTITOUCH is present and when hid-multitouch
is loaded, let's pass the device to hid-multitouch even if it has
not been registered in hid-multitouch.

If any other driver wants to take precedence over hid-multitouch,
the usual way of adding it to hid_have_special_driver will work as
the quirk HID_QUIRK_MULTITOUCH won't be set by the generic hid layer.
