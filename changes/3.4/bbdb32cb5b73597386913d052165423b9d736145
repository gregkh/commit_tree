Fix pppol2tp getsockname()

While testing L2TP functionality, I came across a bug in getsockname().  The
IP address returned within the pppol2tp_addr's addr memember was not being
set to the IP  address in use.  This bug is caused by using inet_sk() on the
wrong socket (the L2TP socket rather than the underlying UDP socket), and was
likely introduced during the addition of L2TPv3 support.
