r8169: fix unsigned int wraparound with TSO

The r8169 may get stuck or show bad behaviour after activating TSO :
the net_device is not stopped when it has no more TX descriptors.
This problem comes from TX_BUFS_AVAIL which may reach -1 when all
transmit descriptors are in use. The patch simply tries to keep positive
values.

Tested with 8111d(onboard) on a D510MO, and with 8111e(onboard) on a
Zotac 890GXITX.
