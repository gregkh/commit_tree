i2c: Support for Netlogic XLR/XLS I2C controller.

Add support for the intergrated I2C controller on Netlogic
XLR/XLS MIPS SoC.

The changes are to add a new file i2c/buses/i2c-xlr.c, containing the
i2c bus implementation, and to update i2c/buses/{Kconfig,Makefile} to
add the CONFIG_I2C_XLR option.
