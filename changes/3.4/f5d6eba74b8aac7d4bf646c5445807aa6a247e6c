regmap: Fix future missing prototype of devres_alloc() and friends

[Fix for breakage which will be introduced during the merge window via
header reworks in another tree, the regmap tree does include device.h
but Paul's tree breaks that.  Reworded subject to reflect -- broonie]

regmap.s uses devres_alloc() and others that are prototyped in device.h.
Include that to solve the following:

drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c: In function 'devm_regmap_init':
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:331:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'devres_alloc' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:338:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'devres_add' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:340:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'devres_free' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c: In function '_regmap_raw_write':
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:421:5: error: implicit declaration of function 'dev_err' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
