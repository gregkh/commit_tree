proc/pid/pagemap: correctly report non-present ptes and holes between vmas

Reset the current pagemap-entry if the current pte isn't present, or if
current vma is over.  Otherwise pagemap reports last entry again and
again.

Non-present pte reporting was broken in commit 092b50bacd1c ("pagemap:
introduce data structure for pagemap entry")

Reporting for holes was broken in commit 5aaabe831eb5 ("pagemap: avoid
splitting thp when reading /proc/pid/pagemap")
