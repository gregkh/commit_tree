memcg: remove PCG_MOVE_LOCK flag from page_cgroup

PCG_MOVE_LOCK is used for bit spinlock to avoid race between overwriting
pc->mem_cgroup and page statistics accounting per memcg.  This lock helps
to avoid the race but the race is very rare because moving tasks between
cgroup is not a usual job.  So, it seems using 1bit per page is too
costly.

This patch changes this lock as per-memcg spinlock and removes
PCG_MOVE_LOCK.

If smaller lock is required, we'll be able to add some hashes but I'd like
to start from this.
