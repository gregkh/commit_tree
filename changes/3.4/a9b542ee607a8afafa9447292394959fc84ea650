PM / QoS: unconditionally build the feature

The PM QoS feature originally didn't depend on CONFIG_PM, which was
mistakenly changed by commit e8db0be1245de16a6cc6365506abc392c3c212d4

    PM QoS: Move and rename the implementation files

Later, commit d020283dc694c9ec31b410f522252f7a8397e67d

    PM / QoS: CPU C-state breakage with PM Qos change

partially fixed that by introducing a static inline definition of
pm_qos_request(), but that still didn't allow user space to use
the PM QoS interface if CONFIG_PM was unset (which had been possible
before).  For this reason, remove the dependency of PM QoS on
CONFIG_PM to make it work (as intended) with CONFIG_PM unset.

[rjw: Replaced the original changelog with a new one.]
