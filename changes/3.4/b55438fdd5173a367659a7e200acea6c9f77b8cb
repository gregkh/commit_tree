PCI: prepare pci=realloc for multiple options

Let the user could enable and disable with pci=realloc=on or pci=realloc=off

Also
1. move variable and functions near the place they are used.
2. change macro to function
3. change related functions and variable to static and _init
4. update parameter description accordingly.

This will let us add a config option to control default behavior, and
still allow the user to turn off automatic reallocation if it fails on
their platform until a permanent solution is found.

-v2: still honor pci=realloc, and treat it as pci=realloc=on
     also use enum instead of ...
-v3: update kernel-paramenters.txt according to Jesse.
