iwlwifi: restore PAN support

in iwlwifi: move setting up fw parameters

Meenakshi moved code up to configure the transport layer, but this
code read the sku before it was set (from the EEPROM). This killed
P2P.
Only the ucode_flags are needed to configure the transport layer, not
the sku which _must_ be set after the EEPROM is read.

We need to reconfigure the transport in case the EEPROM disabled PAN
support. This is not the nicest thing to do, but we have no choice.
Document that we are allowed to configure the transport several times
before start_fw, but not after.
