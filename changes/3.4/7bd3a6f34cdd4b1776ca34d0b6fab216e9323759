ASoC: dapm: Supply the DAI and substream when calling stream events

In order to allow us to do something smarter than iterate through widgets
doing strcmp() to work out what to power up for stream events change the
interface used to generate them to be based on the combination of a DAI
and a stream direction rather than just a simple string identifying the
stream.

At some point we'll probably want a set of channels too.
