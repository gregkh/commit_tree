PM / Freezer: Remove references to TIF_FREEZE in comments

This patch removes all the references in the code about the TIF_FREEZE
flag removed by commit a3201227f803ad7fd43180c5195dbe5a2bf998aa

    freezer: make freezing() test freeze conditions in effect instead of TIF_FREEZE

There still are some references to TIF_FREEZE in
Documentation/power/freezing-of-tasks.txt, but it looks like that
documentation needs more thorough work to reflect how the new
freezer works, and hence merely removing the references to TIF_FREEZE
won't really help. So I have not touched that part in this patch.
