spi/pl022: Allow request for higher frequency than maximum possible

Currently, if we request for frequency greater than maximum possible, spi driver
returns error.

For example, if the spi block src frequency is 333/4 MHz, i.e. 83.33.. MHz,
maximum frequency programmable would be src/2. Which would come around 41.6...

It is difficult to pass frequency in these figures. We normally try to program
in round figures, like 42 MHz and it should get programmed to <=
requested_frequency, i.e. 41.6...

For this to happen, we must not return error even if requested freq is higher
than max possible. But should program it to max possible.
