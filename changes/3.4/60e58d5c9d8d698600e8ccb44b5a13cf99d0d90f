crc32: miscellaneous cleanups

Misc cleanup of lib/crc32.c and related files.

- remove unnecessary header files.

- straighten out some convoluted ifdef's

- rewrite some references to 2 dimensional arrays as 1 dimensional
  arrays to make them correct.  I.e.  replace tab[i] with tab[0][i].

- a few trivial whitespace changes

- fix a warning in gen_crc32tables.c caused by a mismatch in the type of
  the pointer passed to output table.  Since the table is only used at
  kernel compile time, it is simpler to make the table big enough to hold
  the largest column size used.  One cannot make the column size smaller
  in output_table because it has to be used by both the le and be tables
  and they can have different column sizes.
