rbd: small changes

Here is another set of small code tidy-ups:
    - Define SECTOR_SHIFT and SECTOR_SIZE, and use these symbolic
      names throughout.  Tell the blk_queue system our physical
      block size, in the (unlikely) event we want to use something
      other than the default.
    - Delete the definition of struct rbd_info, which is never used.
    - Move the definition of dev_to_rbd() down in its source file,
      just above where it gets first used, and change its name to
      dev_to_rbd_dev().
    - Replace an open-coded operation in rbd_dev_release() to use
      dev_to_rbd_dev() instead.
    - Calculate the segment size for a given rbd_device just once in
      rbd_init_disk().
    - Use the '%zd' conversion specifier in rbd_snap_size_show(),
      since the value formatted is a size_t.
    - Switch to the '%llu' conversion specifier in rbd_snap_id_show().
      since the value formatted is unsigned.
