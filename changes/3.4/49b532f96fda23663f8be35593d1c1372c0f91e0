Revert "serial/8250_pci: setup-quirk workaround for the kt serial controller"

This reverts commit 448ac154c957c4580531fa0c8f2045816fe2f0e7.

The semantic of UPF_IIR_ONCE is only guaranteed to workaround the race
condition in the kt serial's iir register if the only source of
interrupts is THRE (fifo-empty) events.  An modem status event at the
wrong time can again cause an iir read to drop the 'empty' status
leading to a hang.  So, revert this in preparation for using the
existing "I don't trust my iir register" workaround in the 8250 core
(UART_BUG_THRE).
