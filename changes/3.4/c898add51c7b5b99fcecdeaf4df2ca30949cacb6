usb/uas: only bind if the hcd supports SG

The UAS driver requires SG support by the HCD operating the device. This
patch stops UAS from operating on a HCD without sg support and prints a
message to let him know.

The spec says:
|For [USB2] backward compatibility, the device shall present [BOT] as
|alternate interface zero (primary) and [UAS] as alternate interface one
|(secondary). A device which does not need backward compatibility with
|[BOT] shall present [UAS] as alternate interface zero. In [USB2]
|systems, the [BOT] driver or an associated filter driver may need to
|issue a SET INTERFACE request for alternate interface one and then allow
|the [UAS] driver to load.

If the user used usb_modeswitch to switch to UAS then he can go back to
BOT or use a different HCD. In case UAS is the only interface then there
is currently no way out.
In future usb_sg_wait() should be extended to provide a non-blocking
interface so it can work with the UAS driver.
