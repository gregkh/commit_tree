IB: Change CQE "csum_ok" field to a bit flag

Use a bit in wc_flags rather then a whole integer to hold the
"checksum OK" flag.  By itself, this change doesn't reduce the size of
struct ib_wc on 64bit machines -- it stays on 56 bytes because of
padding.  However, it will allow to add more fields in the future
without enlarging the struct.  Also, it will let us have a unified
approach with future libibverbs checksum offload reporting, because a
bit flag doesn't break the library ABI.

This patch was suggested during conversation with Liran Liss
