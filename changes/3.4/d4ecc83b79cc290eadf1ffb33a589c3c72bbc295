[media] tea575x-tuner: update to latest V4L2 framework requirements

The tea575x-tuner module has been updated to use the latest V4L2 framework
functionality. This also required changes in the drivers that rely on it.

The tea575x changes are:

- The drivers must provide a v4l2_device struct to the tea module.
- The radio_nr module parameter must be part of the actual radio driver,
  and not of the tea module.
- Changed the frequency range to the normal 76-108 MHz range instead of
  50-150.
- Add hardware frequency seek support.
- Fix broken rxsubchans/audmode handling.
- The application can now select between stereo and mono.
- Support polling for control events.
- Add V4L2 priority handling.

And radio-sf16fmr2.c now uses the isa bus kernel framework.
