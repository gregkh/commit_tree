ASoC: Revert widget I/O locking for 3.4

The widget locking depends on some of the other locking changes which
are queued up for 3.5 not 3.4 so revert the locking changes and reapply
them in 3.5.

This reverts commit 66bf93212f19548f5ed221356b2d70189cc18254 and
96acc357bedad69fbc94d1b923a960af5a411c6f.
