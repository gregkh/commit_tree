ath6kl: Fix bug in using tid given by addba/delba req events

The tid which is given in addba/delba req event is not
just tid but also muxed with the assoc id (MSB 4 bits)
which can be used to determine the corresponding connected
station in softap mode. The actual tid is LSB 4 bits. Using
the tid as it is with rx_tid[] would result in OOB or invalid
memory access in AP mode.
