hugetlb: prevent BUG_ON in hugetlb_fault() -> hugetlb_cow()

Commit 66aebce747eaf ("hugetlb: fix race condition in hugetlb_fault()")
added code to avoid a race condition by elevating the page refcount in
hugetlb_fault() while calling hugetlb_cow().

However, one code path in hugetlb_cow() includes an assertion that the
page count is 1, whereas it may now also have the value 2 in this path.

The consensus is that this BUG_ON has served its purpose, so rather than
extending it to cover both cases, we just remove it.
