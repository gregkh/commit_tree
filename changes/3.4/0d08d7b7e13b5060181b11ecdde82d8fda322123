fs/xattr.c:listxattr(): fall back to vmalloc() if kmalloc() failed

This allocation can be as large as 64k.  As David points out, "falling
back to vmalloc here is much better solution than failing to retreive
the attribute - it will work no matter how fragmented memory gets.  That
means we don't get incomplete backups occurring after days or months of
uptime and successful backups".
