leds-lm3530: set the max_brightness to 127

Only 7 bits are used for updating the brightness.  (register address :
A0h) So the max_brightness property of lm3530 should be set to 127.

On initializing registers, maximum initial brightness is limited to
'max_brightness'.

Division-by-two is removed on updating the brightness.  This arithmetic is
not necessary because the range of brightness is 0 ~ 127= .
