Try to access the pci conf of a pci device that is supposed to show up
in 1s.  If we can read back a valid vendor/device id, we can return
early.

-v2: seperate code to pci_bus_read_dev_vendor_id() from pci_scan_device()
    and reuse it from pciehp code. Suggested by Matthew Wilcox.
-v3: According to Kenj, don't use array in stack, and don't wait too long
    for crs, also return fail status if not found.
    Also separate pci_bus_dev_read_vendor_id() change to another patch.
