[SCSI] libsas: prevent double completion of scmds from eh

We invoke task->task_done() to free the task in the eh case, but at this
point we are prepared for scsi_eh_flush_done_q() to finish off the scmd.

Introduce sas_end_task() to capture the final response status from the
lldd and free the task.

Also take the opportunity to kill this warning.
drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_scsi_host.c: In function ‘sas_end_task’:
drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_scsi_host.c:102:3: warning: case value ‘2’ not in enumerated type ‘enum exec_status’ [-Wswitch]
