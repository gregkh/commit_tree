rcu: Move synchronize_sched_expedited() to rcutree.c

Now that TREE_RCU and TREE_PREEMPT_RCU no longer do anything different
for the single-CPU case, there is no need for multiple definitions of
synchronize_sched_expedited().  It is no longer in any sense a plug-in,
so move it from kernel/rcutree_plugin.h to kernel/rcutree.c.
