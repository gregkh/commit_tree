[SCSI] Revert "[SCSI] libsas: fix sas port naming"

This reverts commit a692b0eec5efae382dfa800e8b4b083f172921a7.

Tom reports:

...and missing 2 out of 4 drives connected to mvsas.  Commit a692b0ee
made the assumption that all the phy ids an lldd registers to libsas are
unique.  However, in the "multi-chip" case mvsas does a rather annoying
duplication of phy ids in the array passed to libsas.  So, for example,
chip0 has phy0-3 at ha phy index 0-3 and chip1 has its phy0-3 at ha phy
index 4-7.  The more natural model would be to create a scsi_host (and
sas_ha) per chip (controller), but for now revert the naming fix which
unfortunately means dealing with unpredictable end-device names for a
bit longer.
