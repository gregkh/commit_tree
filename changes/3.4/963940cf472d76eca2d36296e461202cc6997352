USB: option: make interface blacklist work again

commit 0d905fd "USB: option: convert Huawei K3765, K4505, K4605
reservered interface to blacklist" accidentally ANDed two
blacklist tests by leaving out a return.  This was not noticed
because the two consecutive bracketless if statements made it
syntactically correct.
