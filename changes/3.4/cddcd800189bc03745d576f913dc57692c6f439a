btrfs: Fix kfree of member instead of structure

Correctness fix: The kfree calls in the add_delayed_* functions free
the node that's passed into it, but the node is a member of another
structure. It works because it's always the first member of the
containing structure, but it should really be using the containing
structure itself.
