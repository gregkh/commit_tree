net/9p: handle flushed Tclunk/Tremove

When a Tclunk or Tremove request is flushed, the fid is not freed on the
server.

p9_client_clunk() should retry once on interrupt, then if interrupted
again, leak the fid for the duration of the connection.

p9_client_remove() should call p9_client_clunk() on interrupt
instead of unconditionally destroying the fid.
