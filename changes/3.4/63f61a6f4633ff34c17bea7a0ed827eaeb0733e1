revert "proc: clear_refs: do not clear reserved pages"

Revert commit 85e72aa5384 ("proc: clear_refs: do not clear reserved
pages"), which was a quick fix suitable for -stable until ARM had been
moved over to the gate_vma mechanism:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/14/55

With commit f9d4861f ("ARM: 7294/1: vectors: use gate_vma for vectors user
mapping"), ARM does now use the gate_vma, so the PageReserved check can be
removed from the proc code.
