hugetlb: cleanup hugetlb.h

Make a couple of small cleanups to linux/include/hugetlb.h.  The
set_file_hugepages() function, which was not used anywhere is removed,
and the hugetlbfs_config and hugetlbfs_inode_info structures with its
HUGETLBFS_I helper function are moved into inode.c, the only place they
were used.

These structures are really linked to the hugetlbfs filesystem
specifically not to hugepage mm handling in general, so they belong in
the filesystem code not in a generally available header.

It would be nice to move the hugetlbfs_sb_info (superblock) structure in
there as well, but it's currently needed in a number of places via the
hstate_vma() and hstate_inode().
