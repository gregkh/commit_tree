lcs: Return zero from ccwgroup devs set_offline function

A return code of non-zero of the devs ccwgroup set_offline function
leaves the dev in online state. Having done a partly offlining
may leave the dev in unusable state. To make sure the dev is set to
offline, zero is returned. A setup trace entry is written in case
the offlining steps encountered some trouble.
