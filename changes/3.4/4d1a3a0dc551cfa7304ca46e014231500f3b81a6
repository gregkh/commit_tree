ARM: 7218/1: mmc: mmci: Provide option to configure bus signal direction

The ST Micro variant supports bus signal direction indication. A new
member in the variant struct is added for this.

Moreover the actual signal direction configuration is board specific,
thus the amba mmci platform data is extended with a new member to be
able provide mmci with these specific board configurations.

This patch is based upon a patch from Sebastian Rasmussen.
