mm, hugetlb: add thread name and pid to SHM_HUGETLB mlock rlimit warning

Add the thread name and pid of the application that is allocating shm
segments with MAP_HUGETLB without being a part of
/proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group or having CAP_IPC_LOCK.

This identifies the application so it may be fixed by avoiding using the
deprecated exception (see Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt).
