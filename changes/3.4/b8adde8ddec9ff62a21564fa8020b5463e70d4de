kdb: Avoid using dbg_io_ops until it is initialized

This fixes a bug with setting a breakpoint during kdb initialization
(from kdb_cmds).  Any call to kdb_printf() before the initialization
of the kgdboc serial console driver (which happens much later during
bootup than kdb_init), results in kernel panic due to the use of
dbg_io_ops before it is initialized.
