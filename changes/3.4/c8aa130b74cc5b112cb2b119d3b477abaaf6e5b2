PM / Domains: Add OF support

A device node pointer is added to generic pm domain structure to associate
the domain with a node in the device tree. The platform code parses the
device tree to find available nodes representing the generic power domain,
instantiates the available domains and initializes them by calling
pm_genpd_init().

Nodes representing the devices include a phandle of the power domain to
which it belongs. As these devices get instantiated, the driver code
checkes for availability of a power domain phandle, converts the phandle
to a device node and uses the new pm_genpd_of_add_device() api to
associate the device with a power domain.

pm_genpd_of_add_device() runs through its list of registered power domains
and matches the OF node of the domain with the one specified as the
parameter. If a match is found, the device is associated with the matched
domain.
