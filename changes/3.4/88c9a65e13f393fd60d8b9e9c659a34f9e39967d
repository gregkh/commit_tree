perf/x86: Disable LBR support for older Intel Atom processors

The patch adds a restriction for Intel Atom LBR support. Only
steppings 10 (PineView) and more recent are supported. Older models
do not have a functional LBR. Their LBR does not freeze on PMU
interrupt which makes LBR unusable in the context of perf_events.
