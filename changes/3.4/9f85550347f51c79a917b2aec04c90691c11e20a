ARM: 7359/2: smp_twd: Only wait for reprogramming on active cpus

During booting of cpu1, there is a short window where cpu1
is online, but not active where cpu1 is occupied by waiting
to become active. If cpu0 then decides to schedule something
on cpu1 and wait for it to complete, before cpu0 has set
cpu1 active, we have a deadlock.

Typically it's this CPU frequency transition that happens at
this time, so let's just not wait for it to happen, it will
happen whenever the CPU eventually comes online instead.
