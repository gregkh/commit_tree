PCI: check for pci bar restore completion and retry

On some OEM systems, pci_restore_state() is called while FLR has not yet
completed.  As a result, PCI BAR register restore is not successful.  This fix
reads back the restored value and compares it with saved value and re-tries 10
times before giving up.
