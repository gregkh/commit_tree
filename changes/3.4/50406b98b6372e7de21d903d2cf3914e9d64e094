rcu: Make rcu_sleep_check() also check rcu_lock_map

Although it is OK to be preempted in an RCU read-side critical section
for TREE_PREEMPT_RCU, it is definitely not OK to be preempted, block,
or might_sleep() within an RCU read-side critical section for TREE_RCU.
Unfortunately, rcu_might_sleep() currently only checks for RCU-bh and
RCU-sched read-side critical sections.  This commit therefore makes
rcu_might_sleep() check for RCU read-side critical sections, but only
in TREE_RCU builds.
