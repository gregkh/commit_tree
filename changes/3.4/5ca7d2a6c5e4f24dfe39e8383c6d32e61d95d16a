dynamic_debug: describe_flags with '=[pmflt_]*'

Change describe_flags() to emit '=[pmflt_]+' for current callsite
flags, or just '=_' when they're disabled.  Having '=' in output
allows a more selective grep expression; in contrast '-' may appear
in filenames, line-ranges, and format-strings.  '=' also has better
mnemonics, saying; "the current setting is equal to <flags>".

This allows grep "=_" <dbgfs>/dynamic_debug/control to see disabled
callsites while avoiding the many occurrences of " = " seen in format
strings.

Enlarge flagsbufs to handle additional flag char, and alter
ddebug_parse_flags() to allow flags=0, so that user can turn off all
debug flags via:

  ~# echo =_ > <dbgfs>/dynamic_debug/control
