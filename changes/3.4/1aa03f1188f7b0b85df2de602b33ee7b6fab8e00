rcu: Simplify unboosting checks

This is a port of commit #82e78d80 from TREE_PREEMPT_RCU to
TINY_PREEMPT_RCU.

This commit uses the fact that current->rcu_boost_mutex is set
any time that the RCU_READ_UNLOCK_BOOSTED flag is set in the
current->rcu_read_unlock_special bitmask.  This allows tests of
the bit to be changed to tests of the pointer, which in turn allows
the RCU_READ_UNLOCK_BOOSTED flag to be eliminated.

Please note that the check of current->rcu_read_unlock_special need not
change because any time that RCU_READ_UNLOCK_BOOSTED was set, so was
RCU_READ_UNLOCK_BLOCKED.  Therefore, __rcu_read_unlock() can continue
testing current->rcu_read_unlock_special for non-zero, as before.
