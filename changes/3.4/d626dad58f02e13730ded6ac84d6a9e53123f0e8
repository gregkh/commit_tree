Input: sentelic - filter taps in absolute mode

Taps in absolute positioning single-finger mode are currently reported
as physical clicks by the driver. This should be handled by userspace,
not the kernel.

When a tap occurs, the FSP_PB0_LBTN bit is set, but the FSP_PB0_PHY_BTN
is not. We use this to filter out physical clicks from taps.
