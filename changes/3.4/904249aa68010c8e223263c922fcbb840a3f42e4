mm: fix up the vmscan stat in vmstat

The "pgsteal" stat is confusing because it counts both direct reclaim as
well as background reclaim.  However, we have "kswapd_steal" which also
counts background reclaim value.

This patch fixes it and also makes it match the existng "pgscan_" stats.

Test:
pgsteal_kswapd_dma32 447623
pgsteal_kswapd_normal 42272677
pgsteal_kswapd_movable 0
pgsteal_direct_dma32 2801
pgsteal_direct_normal 44353270
pgsteal_direct_movable 0
