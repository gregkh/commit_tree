ASoC: omap-abe-twl6040: DAI link selection based on platform data

We can have machines without DMIC connected. In this case there is
no need to create amother (unusable) capture PCM on the card.
The existence of the DMIC connection can be checked via
pdata->has_dmic.
Select the correct dai_link structure for the card based on
pdata->has_dmic.
