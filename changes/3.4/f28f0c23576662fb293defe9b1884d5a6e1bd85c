x86: Move some signal-handling definitions to a common header

There are some definitions which are duplicated between
kernel/signal.c and ia32/ia32_signal.c; move them to a common header
file.

Rather than adding stuff to existing header files which contain data
structures, create a new header file; hence the slightly odd name
("all the good ones were taken.")

Note: nothing relied on signal_fault() being defined in
<asm/ptrace.h>.
