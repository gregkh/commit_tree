pch_gbe: fix transmit races

Andy reported pch_gbe triggered "NETDEV WATCHDOG" errors.

May 11 11:06:09 kontron kernel: WARNING: at net/sched/sch_generic.c:261
dev_watchdog+0x1ec/0x200() (Not tainted)
May 11 11:06:09 kontron kernel: Hardware name: N/A
May 11 11:06:09 kontron kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0 (pch_gbe):
transmit queue 0 timed out

It seems pch_gbe has a racy tx path (races with TX completion path)

Remove tx_queue_lock lock since it has no purpose, we must use tx_lock
instead.
