[SCSI] libfcoe: Support extra MAC descriptor to be used as FCoE MAC

Some switch implementations (eg., HP virtual connect FlexFabric) send two MAC
descriptors in FIP FLOGI response, with first MAC descriptor (granted_mac) used
as FPMA, and the second one (fcoe_mac) used as destination address for
sending/receiving FCoE packets. fip_mac continues to be used for FIP traffic.
This patch introduces fcoe_mac in fcoe_fcf structure. For regular switches,
both fcoe_mac and fip_mac will be the same. For the switches that send
additional MAC descriptor, fcoe_mac is updated.
