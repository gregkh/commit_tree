ceph: ensure Boolean options support both senses

Many ceph-related Boolean options offer the ability to both enable
and disable a feature.  For all those that don't offer this, add
a new option so that they do.

Note that ceph_show_options()--which reports mount options currently
in effect--only reports the option if it is different from the
default value.
