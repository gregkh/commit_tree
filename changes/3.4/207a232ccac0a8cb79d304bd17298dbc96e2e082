btrfs: don't add both copies of DUP to reada extent tree

Normally when there are 2 copies of a block, we add both to the
reada extent tree and prefetch only the one that is easier to reach.
This way we can better utilize multiple devices.
In case of DUP this makes no sense as both copies reside on the
same device.
