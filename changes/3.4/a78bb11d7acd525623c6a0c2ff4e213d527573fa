jbd2: protect all log tail updates with j_checkpoint_mutex

There are some log tail updates that are not protected by j_checkpoint_mutex.
Some of these are harmless because they happen during startup or shutdown but
updates in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() and jbd2_journal_flush() can
really race with other log tail updates (e.g. someone doing
jbd2_journal_flush() with someone running jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()). So
protect all log tail updates with j_checkpoint_mutex.
