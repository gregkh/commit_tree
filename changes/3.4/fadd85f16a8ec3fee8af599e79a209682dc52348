x86/mce: Fix return value of mce_chrdev_read() when erst is disabled

Current kernel MCE code reads ERST at the first reading of /dev/mcelog
(maybe in starting mcelogd,) even if the system does not support ERST,
which results in a fake "no such device" message (as described in [1].)
This problem is not critical, but can confuse system admins.
This patch fixes it by filtering the return value from lower (ACPI) layer.
