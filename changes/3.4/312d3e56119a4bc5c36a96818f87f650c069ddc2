[SCSI] libsas: remove ata_port.lock management duties from lldds

Each libsas driver (mvsas, pm8001, and isci) has invented a different
method for managing the ap->lock.  The lock is held by the ata
->queuecommand() path.  mvsas drops it prior to acquiring any internal
locks which allows it to hold its internal lock across calls to
task->task_done().  This capability is important as it is the only way
the driver can flush task->task_done() instances to guarantee that it no
longer has any in-flight references to a domain_device at
->lldd_dev_gone() time.
