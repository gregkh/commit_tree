KVM: PPC: Add HPT preallocator

We're currently allocating 16MB of linear memory on demand when creating
a guest. That does work some times, but finding 16MB of linear memory
available in the system at runtime is definitely not a given.

So let's add another command line option similar to the RMA preallocator,
that we can use to keep a pool of page tables around. Now, when a guest
gets created it has a pretty low chance of receiving an OOM.
