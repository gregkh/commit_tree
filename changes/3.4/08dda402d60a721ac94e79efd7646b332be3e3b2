x86/mce: Replace hard coded hex constants with symbolic defines

Magic constants like 0x0134 in code just invite questions on
where they come from, what they mean, can they be changed.

Provide #defines for the architecturally defined MCACOD values
with a reference to the Intel Software Developers manual which
describes them.
