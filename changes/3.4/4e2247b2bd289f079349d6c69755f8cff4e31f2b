[SCSI] sd: Add runtime pm in the sd_check_events()

The sd_check_event() will be called periodly even when the device is in the
suspended status to check media event. The scsi_test_unit_ready() in the
sd_check_event() will issue scsi cmd request. Issuing scsi request when the
device is in the suspeneded status will cause problem. For example, when a usb
flash disk in the suspended status, scsi_test_unit_ready() issues a scsi
request. The request will be returned as failed because the usb device is not
active. The patch adds scsi_autopm_get_device() and scsi_autopm_put_device()
around scsi_test_unit_ready() in the sd_check_event() to resolve such problem.
