ARM: ux500: db8500: list most devices in the snowball device tree

This adds all devices that are normally present through the
u8500_init_machine function in the device tree as well, which
will duplicate the devices that are visible.

This will not do much by itself because the device from the
device tree are not matched by any device driver until they
are converted as well. The next step is to move over one
device at a time to actually be used from the device tree
instead of the hardcoded device using auxdata to pass the
correct platform_data.
