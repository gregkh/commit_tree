staging, vt6656/wpactl.c: A basic style cleanup

This patch cleans up the coding style in
drivers/staging/vt6656/wpactl.c to closer match the generally accepted
kernel CodingStyle. It is by no means a "make it perfect" patch, but
it does get the file a fair bit closer to matching the accepted style
(whomever was involved in the evolution of this file seriously need to
configure their editors to maintain a consistent style - it was a
mess).

Besides pure style cleanups I also took the liberty of removing some
pointless parens, some unneeded casts and removing some commented out code
(it was obviously not used and git has it if it's ever needed in the
future).
