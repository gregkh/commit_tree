arcnet: rimi: Fix device name in debug output

arcrimi_probe() calls BUGMSG() before register_netdev() happens. BUGMSG()
itself prints dev->name, but as the format string hasn't been expanded by
register_netdev() yet, the output contains bogus device name such as

	arc%d: Given: node 00h, shmem 0h, irq 0

As we don't know the device name yet, just drop the prefix completely from
the debugging messages.
