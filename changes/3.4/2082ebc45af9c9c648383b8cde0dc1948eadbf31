[SCSI] fix the new host byte settings (DID_TARGET_FAILURE and DID_NEXUS_FAILURE)

This patch fixes the host byte settings DID_TARGET_FAILURE and
DID_NEXUS_FAILURE.  The function __scsi_error_from_host_byte, tries to reset
the host byte to DID_OK. But that does not happen because of the OR operation.

Here is the flow.

scsi_softirq_done-> scsi_decide_disposition -> __scsi_error_from_host_byte

Let's take an example with DID_NEXUS_FAILURE. In scsi_decide_disposition,
result will be set as DID_NEXUS_FAILURE (=0x11). Then in
__scsi_error_from_host_byte, when we do OR with DID_OK.  Purpose is to reset
it back to DID_OK. But that does not happen.  This patch fixes this issue.
