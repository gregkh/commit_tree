staging: android/lowmemorykiller: Better mm handling

LMK should not directly check for task->mm. The reason is that the
process' threads may exit or detach its mm via use_mm(), but other
threads may still have a valid mm. To catch this we use
find_lock_task_mm(), which walks up all threads and returns an
appropriate task (with lock held).
