hfsplus: add an ioctl to bless files

Making an hfsplus partition bootable requires the ability to "bless" a
file by putting its inode number in the volume header. Doing this from
userspace on a mounted filesystem is impractical since the kernel will
write back the original values on unmount. Add an ioctl to allow userspace
to update the volume header information based on the target file.
