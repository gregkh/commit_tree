pstore: Introduce get_reason_str() to pstore

Recently, there has been some changes in kmsg_dump() below and they have been applied to linus-tree.
 (1) kmsg_dump(KMSG_DUMP_KEXEC) was removed.

 (2) The order of "enum kmsg_dump_reason" was modified.

Replace the fragile reason_str array with a more robust solution that
will not be broken by future re-arrangements of the enum values.
