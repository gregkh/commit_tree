drm/radeon: add support for evergreen/ni tiling informations v11

evergreen and northern island gpu needs more informations for 2D tiling
than previous r6xx/r7xx. Add field to tiling ioctl to allow userspace
to provide those.

The v8 cs checking change to track color view on r6xx/r7xx doesn't
affect old userspace as old userspace always emited 0 for this register.

v2 fix r6xx/r7xx 2D tiling computation
v3 fix r6xx/r7xx height align for untiled surface & add support for
   tile split on evergreen and newer
v4 improve tiling debugging output
v5 fix tile split code for evergreen and newer
v6 set proper tile split for crtc register
v7 fix tile split limit value
v8 add COLOR_VIEW checking to r6xx/r7xx checker, add evergreen cs
   checking, update safe reg for r600, evergreen and cayman.
   Evergreen checking need some work around for stencil alignment
   issues
v9 fix tile split value range, fix compressed texture handling and
   mipmap calculation, allow evergreen check to be silencious in
   front of current broken userspace (depth/stencil alignment issue)
v10 fix eg 3d texture and compressed texture, fix r600 depth array,
    fix r600 color view computation, add support for evergreen stencil
    split
v11 more verbose debugging in some case
