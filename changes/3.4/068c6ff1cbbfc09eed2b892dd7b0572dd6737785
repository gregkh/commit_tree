drm/i915: Remove the upper limit on the bo size for mapping into the CPU domain

The original intention of comparing the bo against the mappable GTT
limits was to prevent a subsequent faulting of the bo into the GTT from
clearing the entire GTT in vain. However, that was clearly a cut'n'paste
mistake as a CPU mapping never binds the bo into the aperture. Whilst
there may be some merit to limiting the maximum size of the bo to
something that can be utilized by the GPU, that limit itself does not
belong as a safeguard to mmapping the bo, so remove the check entirely.
