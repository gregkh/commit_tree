dmaengine: consolidate tx_status functions

Now that we have the completed cookie in the dma_chan structure, we
can consolidate the tx_status functions by providing a function to set
the txstate structure and returning the DMA status.  We also provide
a separate helper to set the residue for cookies which are still in
progress.
