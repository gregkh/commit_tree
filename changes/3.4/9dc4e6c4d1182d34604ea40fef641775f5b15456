nfsd: don't fail unchecked creates of non-special files

Allow a v3 unchecked open of a non-regular file succeed as if it were a
lookup; typically a client in such a case will want to fall back on a
local open, so succeeding and giving it the filehandle is more useful
than failing with nfserr_exist, which makes it appear that nothing at
all exists by that name.

Similarly for v4, on an open-create, return the same errors we would on
an attempt to open a non-regular file, instead of returning
nfserr_exist.

This fixes a problem found doing a v4 open of a symlink with
O_RDONLY|O_CREAT, which resulted in the current client returning EEXIST.

Thanks also to Trond for analysis.
