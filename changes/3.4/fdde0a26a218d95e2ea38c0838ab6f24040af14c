Bluetooth: Set security level on incoming pairing request

If a master would like to raise the security level, it will send a
pairing request. While the pending security level is set on an incoming
security request (from a slave), it is not set on a pairing request. As
a result, the security level would not be raised on the slave in such
case.

Fix this by setting the pending security when receiving pairing
requests according to the requested authorization.
