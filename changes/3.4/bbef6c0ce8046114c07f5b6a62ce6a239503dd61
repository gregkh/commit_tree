[SCSI] hpsa: make target and lun match what SCSI REPORT LUNs returns

Some distros have a "rescan-scsi-bus.sh" script which depends on
SCSI REPORT LUNs not reporting something different than what the
driver tells the kernel, even if the driver uses scan_start and
scan_finished methods of the SCSI host template to override the
usual SCSI midlayer discovery code.  Previously, 1 was added to
the LUN to make room to insert the RAID controller device at
LUN 0.  Now, the RAID controller is moved to bus 3, and 1 is no
longer added to the LUN.  However, SCSI REPORT LUNS on Smart Array
doesn't report physical devices like tape drives or auto-loaders
as it turns out, so those particular device types still won't match.
Generally the logical drives are reported first however, so at
least those should match.
