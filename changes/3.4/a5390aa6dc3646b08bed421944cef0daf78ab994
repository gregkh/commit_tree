PCI: don't publish new root bus until it's fully initialized

When pci_create_root_bus() adds the new struct pci_bus to the global
pci_root_buses list, the bus becomes visible to other parts of the
kernel, so it should be fully initialized.

This patch delays adding the bus to the pci_root_buses list until after
all the struct pci_bus initialization is finished.
