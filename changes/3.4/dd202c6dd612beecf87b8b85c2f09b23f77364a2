drm/i915: use gtfifodbg

Add register definitions for GTFIFODBG, and clear it during init time to
make sure state is correct.

This register tells us if either a read, or a write occurred while the
fifo was full. It seems like bit 2 is an OR of bit 0 and bit 1, so we
check that as well, but the documents are not quite clear.
