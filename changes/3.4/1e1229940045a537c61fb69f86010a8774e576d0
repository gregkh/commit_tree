crypto: user - Fix lookup of algorithms with IV generator

We lookup algorithms with crypto_alg_mod_lookup() when instantiating via
crypto_add_alg(). However, algorithms that are wrapped by an IV genearator
(e.g. aead or genicv type algorithms) need special care. The userspace
process hangs until it gets a timeout when we use crypto_alg_mod_lookup()
to lookup these algorithms. So export the lookup functions for these
algorithms and use them in crypto_add_alg().
