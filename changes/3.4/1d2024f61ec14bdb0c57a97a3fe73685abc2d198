ixgbe: Address fact that RSC was not setting GSO size for incoming frames

This patch is meant to address the fact that RSC has not been setting the
gso_size value on the skb.  As a result performance on lossy TCP
connections was negatively impacted.  This change resolves the issue by
setting gso_size to the average size for incoming packets.
