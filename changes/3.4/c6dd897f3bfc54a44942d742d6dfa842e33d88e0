mm: move page-types.c from Documentation to tools/vm

tools/ is the better place for vm tools which are used by many people.
Moving them to tools also make them open to more users instead of hide in
Documentation folder.

This patch moves page-types.c to tools/vm/page-types.c.  Also add a
Makefile in tools/vm and fix two coding style problems: a) change const
arrary to 'const char * const', b) change a space to tab for indent.
