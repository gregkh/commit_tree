brcmsmac: "INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU" only when tracing

I keep getting the following messages on the log buffer:
[ 2167.097507] ieee80211 phy0: brcms_c_dotxstatus: INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU
[ 2281.331305] ieee80211 phy0: brcms_c_dotxstatus: INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU
[ 2281.332539] ieee80211 phy0: brcms_c_dotxstatus: INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU
[ 2329.876605] ieee80211 phy0: brcms_c_dotxstatus: INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU
[ 2329.877354] ieee80211 phy0: brcms_c_dotxstatus: INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU
[ 2462.280756] ieee80211 phy0: brcms_c_dotxstatus: INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU
[ 2615.651689] ieee80211 phy0: brcms_c_dotxstatus: INTERMEDIATE but not AMPDU

From the code comment I understand that this something that can -
and does, quite frequently - happen.
