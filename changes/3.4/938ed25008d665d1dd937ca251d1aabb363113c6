m68knommu: make sure 2nd FEC eth interface pins are enabled on 5275 ColdFire

The CONFIG_FEC2 define was removed from the kernel many versions ago.
But it is still being used to set the multi-function pins when compiling
for a ColdFire 527[45] SoC that has 2 ethernet interfaces. Remove the
last remaining uses of this define, and so fix the setting of the pins
for the 2nd ethernet interface.
