staging: android-alarm: Support old drivers via preprocessor aliasing

Older out of tree drivers that were desgined to the Android Alarm
in-kernel API may not build due to the namespace collision fixed in
an earlier patch. Per Arve's suggestion, this patch provides
preprocessor macros that allow older drivers to build.
