ARM: tegra: select required CPU and L2 errata options

The ARM IP revisions in Tegra are:
Tegra20: CPU r1p1, PL310 r2p0
Tegra30: CPU A01=r2p7/>=A02=r2p9, NEON r2p3-50, PL310 r3p1-50

Based on work by Olof Johansson, although the actual list of errata is
somewhat different here, since I added a bunch more and removed one PL310
erratum that doesn't seem applicable.
