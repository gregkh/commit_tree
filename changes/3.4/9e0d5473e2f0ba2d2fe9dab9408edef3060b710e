KVM: s390: do store status after handling STOP_ON_STOP bit

In handle_stop() handle the stop bit before doing the store status as
described for "Stop and Store Status" in the Principles of Operation.
We have to give up the local_int.lock before calling kvm store status
since it calls gmap_fault() which might sleep. Since local_int.lock
only protects local_int.* and not guest memory we can give up the lock.
