KVM: s390: make sigp restart return busy when stop pending

On reboot the guest sends in smp_send_stop() a sigp stop to all CPUs
except for current CPU.  Then the guest switches to the IPL cpu by
sending a restart to the IPL CPU, followed by a sigp stop to the
current cpu. Since restart is handled by userspace it's possible that
the restart is delivered before the old stop.  This means that the IPL
CPU isn't restarted and we have no running CPUs. So let's make sure
that there is no stop action pending when we do the restart.
