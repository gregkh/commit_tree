r8169: add byte queue limit support.

Nothing fancy:
- sent bytes count is notified in the start_xmit path right before
  updating the owner bit in the hardware Tx descriptor (E. Dumazet)
- avoid useless tp->dev dereferencing in start_xmit (E. Dumazet)

Use of netdev_reset_queue is favored over proper accounting in
rtl8169_tx_clear_range since the latter would need more work for the
same result (nb: said accounting degenerates to nothing in xmit_frags).
