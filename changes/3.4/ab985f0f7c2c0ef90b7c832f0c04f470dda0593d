gpio/omap: cleanup omap_gpio_mod_init function

With register offsets now defined for respective OMAP versions we can get rid
of cpu_class_* checks. This function now has common initialization code for
all OMAP versions. Initialization specific to OMAP16xx has been moved within
omap16xx_gpio_init().
