staging: android: persistent_ram: refactor ecc support

Remove CONFIG_ANDROID_RAM_CONSOLE_ERROR_CORRECTION and related
 #ifdefs.  Also allow persistent ram zones without ecc enabled.
For some use cases, like the data portion of the upcoming
persistent_vars patches, or a persistent ftrace ringbuffer,
ecc on every update is too expensive.
