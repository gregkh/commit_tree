libata: skip old error history when counting probe trials

Commit d902747("[libata] Add ATA transport class") introduced
ATA_EFLAG_OLD_ER to mark entries in the error ring as cleared.

But ata_count_probe_trials_cb() didn't check this flag and it still
counts the old error history. So wrong probe trials count is returned
and it causes problem, for example, SATA link speed is slowed down from
3.0Gbps to 1.5Gbps.

Fix it by checking ATA_EFLAG_OLD_ER in ata_count_probe_trials_cb().
