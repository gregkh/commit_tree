sched: Fix more load-balancing fallout

Commits 367456c756a6 ("sched: Ditch per cgroup task lists for
load-balancing") and 5d6523ebd ("sched: Fix load-balance wreckage")
left some more wreckage.

By setting loop_max unconditionally to ->nr_running load-balancing
could take a lot of time on very long runqueues (hackbench!). So keep
the sysctl as max limit of the amount of tasks we'll iterate.

Furthermore, the min load filter for migration completely fails with
cgroups since inequality in per-cpu state can easily lead to such
small loads :/

Furthermore the change to add new tasks to the tail of the queue
instead of the head seems to have some effect.. not quite sure I
understand why.

Combined these fixes solve the huge hackbench regression reported by
Tim when hackbench is ran in a cgroup.
