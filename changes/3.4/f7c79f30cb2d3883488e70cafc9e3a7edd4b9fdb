Btrfs: adjust the write_lock_level as we unlock

btrfs_search_slot sometimes needs write locks on high levels of
the tree.  It remembers the highest level that needs a write lock
and will use that for all future searches through the tree in a given
call.

But, very often we'll just cow the top level or the level below and we
won't really need write locks on the root again after that.  This patch
changes things to adjust the write lock requirement as it unlocks
levels.
