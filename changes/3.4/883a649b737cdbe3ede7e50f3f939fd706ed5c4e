iwlegacy: do not nulify il->vif on reset

This il->vif is dereferenced in different part of iwlegacy code, so do
not nullify it. This should fix random crashes observed in companion
with microcode errors i.e. crash in il3945_config_ap().

Additionally this should address also
WARNING: at drivers/net/wireless/iwlegacy/common.c:4656 il_mac_remove_interface
at least one of the possible reasons of that warning.
