[S390] kernel: Use local_irq_save() for memcpy_real()

Currently in the memcpy_real() function interrupts are disabled with
__arch_local_irq_stnsm(). In order to notify lockdep that interrupts
are disabled, with this patch local_irq_save() is used instead. The
function __arch_local_irq_stnsm() is still used for switching to
real mode.
