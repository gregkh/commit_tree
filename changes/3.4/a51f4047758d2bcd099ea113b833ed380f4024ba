x86, build: Fix portability issues when cross-building

It would appear that we never actually generated a correct CRC when
building on a bigendian machine.  Depending on the word size, we would
either generate an all-zero CRC (64-bit machine) or a byte-swapped
CRC (32-bit machine.)  Fix the types used so we don't arbitrarily use
a 64-bit word to hold 32-bit numbers, and pass the CRC through
put_unaligned_le32() like all the other numbers.
