sfc: Correct interrupt timer quantum for Siena (normal and turbo mode)

We currently assume that the timer quantum for Siena is 5 us, the same
as for Falcon.  This is not correct; timer ticks are generated on a
rota which takes a minimum of 768 cycles (each event delivery or other
timer change will delay it by 3 cycles).  The timer quantum should be
6.144 or 3.072 us depending on whether turbo mode is active.

Replace EFX_IRQ_MOD_RESOLUTION with a timer_quantum_ns field in struct
efx_nic, initialised by the efx_nic_type::probe function.

While we're at it, replace EFX_IRQ_MOD_MAX with a timer_period_max
field in struct efx_nic_type.
