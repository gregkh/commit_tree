memcg swap: use mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap fix

Although mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap has an empty placeholder for
!CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP the definition is placed in the
CONFIG_SWAP ifdef block so we are missing the same definition for
!CONFIG_SWAP which implies !CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP.

This has not been an issue before, because mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap was
not called from !CONFIG_SWAP context.  But Hugh Dickins has a cleanup
patch to call __mem_cgroup_commit_charge_swapin which is defined also
for !CONFIG_SWAP.

Let's move both the empty definition and declaration outside of the
CONFIG_SWAP block to avoid the following compilation error:

  mm/memcontrol.c: In function '__mem_cgroup_commit_charge_swapin':
  mm/memcontrol.c:2837: error: implicit declaration of function 'mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap'

if CONFIG_SWAP is disabled.
