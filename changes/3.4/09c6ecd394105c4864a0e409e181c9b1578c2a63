regmap: Add support for writing to regmap registers via debugfs

To enable writing to the regmap debugfs registers file users will
need to modify the source directly and #define REGMAP_ALLOW_WRITE_DEBUGFS.
The reason for this is that it is dangerous to expose this
functionality in general where clients could potentially be PMICs.
