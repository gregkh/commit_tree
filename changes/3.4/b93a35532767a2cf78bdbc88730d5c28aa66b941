KVM: fix error handling for out of range irq

find_index_from_host_irq returns 0 on error
but callers assume < 0 on error. This should
not matter much: an out of range irq should never happen since
irq handler was registered with this irq #,
and even if it does we get a spurious msix irq in guest
and typically nothing terrible happens.

Still, better to make it consistent.
