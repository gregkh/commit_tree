KVM: PPC: booke: Check for MSR[WE] in prepare_to_enter

This prevents us from inappropriately blocking in a KVM_SET_REGS
ioctl -- the MSR[WE] will take effect when the guest is next entered.

It also causes SRR1[WE] to be set when we enter the guest's interrupt
handler, which is what e500 hardware is documented to do.
