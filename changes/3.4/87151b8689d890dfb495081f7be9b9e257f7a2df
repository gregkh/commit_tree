net: allow pskb_expand_head() to get maximum tailroom

Marc Merlin reported many order-1 allocations failures in TX path on its
wireless setup, that dont make any sense with MTU=1500 network, and non
SG capable hardware.

Turns out part of the problem comes from pskb_expand_head() not using
ksize() to get exact head size given by kmalloc(). Doing the same thing
than __alloc_skb() allows more tailroom in skb and can prevent future
reallocations.

As a bonus, struct skb_shared_info becomes cache line aligned.
