Tools: hv: Fully support the new KVP verbs in the user level daemon

Now fully support the new KVP messages in the user level daemon. Hyper-V defines
multiple persistent pools to which the host can write/read/modify KVP tuples.
In this patch we implement a file for each specified pool, where the KVP tuples
will be stored in the guest.
