USB: sierra: avoid QMI/wwan interface on MC77xx

These devices have a number of non serial interfaces as well.  Use
the existing "Direct IP" blacklist to prevent binding to interfaces
which are handled by other drivers.

We also extend the "Direct IP" blacklist with with interfaces only
seen in "QMI" mode, assuming that these devices use the same
interface numbers for serial interfaces both in "Direct IP" and in
"QMI" mode.
