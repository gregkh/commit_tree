staging: ramster: ramster-specific changes to cluster code

Ramster-specific changes to ocfs2 cluster foundation, including:
A method for fooling the o2 heartbeat into starting without
an ocfs2 filesystem; a new message mechanism ("data magic") for handling
a reply to a message requesting data; a hack for keeping the cluster
alive even after timeouts so cluster machines can be rebooted separately.
