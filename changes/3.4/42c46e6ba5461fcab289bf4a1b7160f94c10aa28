xen/xenbus: ignore console/0

Unfortunately xend creates a bogus console/0 frotend/backend entry pair
on xenstore that console backends cannot properly cope with.
Any guest behavior that is not completely ignoring console/0 is going
to either cause problems with xenconsoled or qemu.
Returning 0 or -ENODEV from xencons_probe is not enough because it is
going to cause the frontend state to become 4 or 6 respectively.
The best possible thing we can do here is just ignore the entry from
xenbus_probe_frontend.
