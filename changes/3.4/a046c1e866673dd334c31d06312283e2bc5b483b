staging:iio:events: Use non-atmoic bitops

We always hold the waitqueue lock when modifying the flags field. So it is safe
to use the non-atomic bitops here instead of the atomic versions.

The lock has to be held, because we need to clear the busy flag and flush the
event FIFO in one atomic operation when closing the event file descriptor.
