usb: gadgetfs: return number of bytes on ep0 read request

A read from GadgetFS endpoint 0 during the data stage of a control
request would always return 0 on success (as returned by
wait_event_interruptible) despite having written data into the user
buffer.
This patch makes it correctly set the return value to the number of
bytes read.
