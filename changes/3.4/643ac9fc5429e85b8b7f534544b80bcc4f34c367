mm: fix testorder interaction between two kswapd patches

Adjusting cc715d99e529 "mm: vmscan: forcibly scan highmem if there are
too many buffer_heads pinning highmem" for -stable reveals that it was
slightly wrong once on top of fe2c2a106663 "vmscan: reclaim at order 0
when compaction is enabled", which specifically adds testorder for the
zone_watermark_ok_safe() test.
