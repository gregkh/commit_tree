sched/rt: Document scheduler related skip-resched-check sites

Create a distinction between scheduler related preempt_enable_no_resched()
calls and the nearly one hundred other places in the kernel that do not
want to reschedule, for one reason or another.

This distinction matters for -rt, where the scheduler and the non-scheduler
preempt models (and checks) are different. For upstream it's purely
documentational.
