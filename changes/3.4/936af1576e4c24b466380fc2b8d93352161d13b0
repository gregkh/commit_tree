aio: don't bother with unmapping when aio_free_ring() is coming from exit_aio()

... since exit_mmap() is coming and it will munmap() everything anyway.
In all other cases aio_free_ring() has ctx->mm == current->mm; moreover,
all other callers of vm_munmap() have mm == current->mm, so this will
allow us to get rid of mm argument of vm_munmap().
