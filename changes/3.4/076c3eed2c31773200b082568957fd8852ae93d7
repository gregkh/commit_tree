sysctl: Rewrite proc_sys_lookup introducing find_entry and lookup_entry.

Replace the helpers that proc_sys_lookup uses with helpers that work
in terms of an entire sysctl directory.  This is worse for sysctl_lock
hold times but it is much better for code clarity and the code cleanups
to come.

find_in_table is no longer needed so it is removed.

find_entry a general helper to find entries in a directory is added.

lookup_entry is a simple wrapper around find_entry that takes the
sysctl_lock increases the use count if an entry is found and drops
the sysctl_lock.
