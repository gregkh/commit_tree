KVM: PPC: refer to paravirt docs in header file

Instead of keeping separate copies of struct kvm_vcpu_arch_shared (one in
the code, one in the docs) that inevitably fail to be kept in sync
(already sr[] is missing from the doc version), just point to the header
file as the source of documentation on the contents of the magic page.
