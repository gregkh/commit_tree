ARM: 7368/1: fault.c: correct how the tsk->[maj|min]_flt gets incremented

commit 8878a539ff19a43cf3729e7562cd528f490246ae was done by me
to make the page fault handler retryable as well as interruptible.

Due to this commit, there is a mistake in the way in which
tsk->[maj|min]_flt counter gets incremented for VM_FAULT_ERROR:
If VM_FAULT_ERROR is returned in the fault flags by handle_mm_fault,
then either maj_flt or min_flt will get incremented. This is wrong
as in the case of a VM_FAULT_ERROR we need to be skip ahead to the
error handling code in do_page_fault.

Added a check after the call to __do_page_fault() to check for
(fault & VM_FAULT_ERROR).
