mfd: Fix ACPI conflict check

The code is currently always checking the first resource of every
device only (several times.) This has been broken since the ACPI check
was added in February 2010 in commit
91fedede0338eb6203cdd618d8ece873fdb7c22c.

Fix the check to run on each resource individually, once.
