powerpc/PCI: make pci_probe_only default to 0

pci_probe_only is set on ppc64 to prevent resource re-allocation
by the core. It's meant to be used in very specific circumstances
such as when operating under a hypervisor that may prevent such
re-allocation.

Instead of default to 1, we make it default to 0 and explicitly
set it in the few cases where we need it.

This fixes FSL PCI which wants it clear among others.
