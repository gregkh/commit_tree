PM / Freezer / Docs: Update documentation about freezing of tasks

The file Documentation/power/freezing-of-tasks.txt was still referencing
the TIF_FREEZE flag, that was removed by the commit
d88e4cb67197d007fb778d62fe17360e970d5bfa(freezer: remove now unused
TIF_FREEZE).

This patch removes all the references of TIF_FREEZE that were left
behind.
