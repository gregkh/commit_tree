staging: tidspbridge: remove ref counting in nldr.c

The nldr module has a nldr_init() and a nldr_exit() whose only purpose
is to keep a reference counting which is not used at all.

This patch only removes the reference count variable, but not the
functions, because they are used through an interface.

There is no functional changes.
