powerpc/85xx: mpc85xxcds - Fix PCI I/O space resource of PCI bridge

There is a PCI bridge(Tsi310) between the MPC8548 and a VIA
southbridge chip.

The bootloader sets the PCI bridge to open a window from 0x0000
to 0x1fff on the PCI I/O space. But the kernel can't set the I/O
resource. In the routine pci_read_bridge_io(), if the base which
is read from PCI_IO_BASE is equal to zero, the routine don't set
the I/O resource of the child bus.

To allow the legacy I/O space on the VIA southbridge to be accessed,
use the fixup to fix the PCI I/O space of the PCI bridge.
