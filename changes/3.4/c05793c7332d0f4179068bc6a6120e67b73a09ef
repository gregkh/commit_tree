m68knommu: clean up init code in ColdFire 532x startup

We can move all the init calls in the initcall code into the more general
arch setup code (which is config_BSP() here). That makes the 532x consistent
with other ColdFire CPUs setup code. It means we can get rid of the initcall
setup here all together. Also make sure we set the arch mach_reset function
pointer to get the local arch reset code called on reset.
