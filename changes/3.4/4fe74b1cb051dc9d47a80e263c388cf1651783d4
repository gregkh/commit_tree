[SCSI] virtio-scsi: SCSI driver for QEMU based virtual machines

The virtio-scsi HBA is the basis of an alternative storage stack
for QEMU-based virtual machines (including KVM).  Compared to
virtio-blk it is more scalable, because it supports many LUNs
on a single PCI slot), more powerful (it more easily supports
passthrough of host devices to the guest) and more easily
extensible (new SCSI features implemented by QEMU should not
require updating the driver in the guest).
