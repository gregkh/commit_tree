tcp: fix retransmit of partially acked frames

Alexander Beregalov reported skb_over_panic errors and provided stack
trace.

I occurs commit a21d45726aca (tcp: avoid order-1 allocations on wifi and
tx path) added a regression, when a retransmit is done after a partial
ACK.

tcp_retransmit_skb() tries to aggregate several frames if the first one
has enough available room to hold the following ones payload. This is
controlled by /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retrans_collapse tunable (default :
enabled)

Problem is we must make sure _pskb_trim_head() doesnt fool
skb_availroom() when pulling some bytes from skb (this pull is done when
receiver ACK part of the frame).
