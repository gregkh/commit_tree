sched/nohz: Correctly initialize 'next_balance' in 'nohz' idle balancer

The 'next_balance' field of 'nohz' idle balancer must be initialized
to jiffies. Since jiffies is initialized to negative 300 seconds the
'nohz' idle balancer does not run for the first 300s (5mins) after
bootup. If no new processes are spawed or no idle cycles happen, the
load on the cpus will remain unbalanced for that duration.
