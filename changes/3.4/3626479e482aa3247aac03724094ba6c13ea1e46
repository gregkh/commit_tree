[media] dvb_frontend: Fix a regression when switching back to DVB-S

There are some softwares (Kaffeine and likely xine) that uses a
DVBv5 call to switch to DVB-S2, but expects that a DVBv3 call to
switch back to DVB-S. Well, this is not right, as a DVBv3 call
doesn't know anything about delivery systems.

However, as, by accident, this used to work, we need to restore its
behavior, in order to avoid regressions with those softwares.
