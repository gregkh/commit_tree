HSI: hsi: Rework hsi_event interface

Remove custom hack and make use of the notifier chain interfaces for
delivering events from the ports to their associated clients.
Clients that want to receive port events need to register their callbacks
using hsi_register_port_event(). The callbacks can be called in interrupt
context. Use hsi_unregestier_port_event() to undo the registration.
