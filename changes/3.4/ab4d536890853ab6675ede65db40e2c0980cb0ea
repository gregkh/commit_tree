ARM: 7398/1: l2x0: only write to debug registers on PL310

PL310 errata #588369 and #727915 require writes to the debug registers
of the cache controller to work around known problems. Writing these
registers on L220 may cause deadlock, so ensure that we only perform
this operation when we identify a PL310 at probe time.
