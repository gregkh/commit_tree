fadump: Reserve the memory for firmware assisted dump.

Reserve the memory during early boot to preserve CPU state data, HPTE region
and RMA (real mode area) region data in case of kernel crash. At the time of
crash, powerpc firmware will store CPU state data, HPTE region data and move
RMA region data to the reserved memory area.

If the firmware-assisted dump fails to reserve the memory, then fallback
to existing kexec-based kdump.

Most of the code implementation to reserve memory has been
adapted from phyp assisted dump implementation written by Linas Vepstas
and Manish Ahuja

This patch also introduces a config option CONFIG_FA_DUMP for firmware
assisted dump feature on Powerpc (ppc64) architecture.
