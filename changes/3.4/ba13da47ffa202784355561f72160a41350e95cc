md: add proper merge_bvec handling to RAID0 and Linear.

These personalities currently set a max request size of one page
when any member device has a merge_bvec_fn because they don't
bother to call that function.

This causes extra works in splitting and combining requests.

So make the extra effort to call the merge_bvec_fn when it exists
so that we end up with larger requests out the bottom.
