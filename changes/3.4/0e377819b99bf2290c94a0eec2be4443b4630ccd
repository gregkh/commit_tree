stb0899: fix the limits for signal strength values

stb0899_read_signal_strength() adds an offset to the result of the table lookup.
That offset must correspond to the lowest value in the lookup table, to make sure
the result doesn't get below 0, which would mean a "very high" value since the
parameter is unsigned.
'strength' and 'snr' need to be initialized to 0 to make sure they have a
defined result in case there is no "internal->lock".
