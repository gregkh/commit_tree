ARM: pxa: fix build failure for regulator consumer in em-x270.c

Commit 737f360d5bef5e01c6cfa755dca0b449a154c1e0

"regulator: Remove support for supplies specified by struct device"

caused this file to break, since it was still relying on the
device field to be present.  Map it onto dev_name appropriately

Since there are two consumers with the name "reg-userspace-consumer",
we have to supply the ID as a suffix in the REGULATOR_CONSUMER calls.
