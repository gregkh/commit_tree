mtd: docg3 fix inbound calculations

The last erase block was not accessible, as the out of bound
check was incorrectly rejecting the last block.
The read/write/erase offset checks were forbidding the usage of the
last block, because of the calculation which was considering the
byte after the last instead of the last byte.
