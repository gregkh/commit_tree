ARM: OMAP2+: Fix OMAP_HDQ_BASE build error

If CONFIG_SOC_OMAP3430 is not set and CONFIG_HDQ_MASTER_OMAP
is selected for w1 driver we get the following error:

arch/arm/mach-omap2/devices.c:662:13: error:
'OMAP_HDQ_BASE' undeclared here (not in a function)

Looks like OMAP_HDQ_BASE is valid for all omaps except
2420, so we can remove the ifdef and not register
the device on 2420.
