sysrq: use SEND_SIG_FORCED instead of force_sig()

Change send_sig_all() to use do_send_sig_info(SEND_SIG_FORCED) instead
of force_sig(SIGKILL).  With the recent changes we do not need force_ to
kill the CLONE_NEWPID tasks.

And this is more correct.  force_sig() can race with the exiting thread,
while do_send_sig_info(group => true) kill the whole process.

Some more notes from Oleg Nesterov:

> Just one note. This change makes no difference for sysrq_handle_kill().

Also,

So, this patch fixes the issue.
