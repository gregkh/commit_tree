powerpc/atomic: Implement atomic*_inc_not_zero

Implement atomic_inc_not_zero and atomic64_inc_not_zero. At the
moment we use atomic*_add_unless which requires us to put 0 and
1 constants into registers. We can also avoid a subtract by
saving the original value in a second temporary.

This removes 3 instructions from fget:

- c0000000001b63c0:       39 00 00 00     li      r8,0
- c0000000001b63c4:       39 40 00 01     li      r10,1
...
- c0000000001b63e8:       7c 0a 00 50     subf    r0,r10,r0
