[CPUFREQ] EXYNOS: Initialize locking_frequency with initial frequency

As per definition, locking_frequency is the initial frequency which is
set by boot-loader. Hence the value is updated with the initial value
during boot time init call.

This code was present in exynos210-cpufreq.c before this consolidation
patch.
