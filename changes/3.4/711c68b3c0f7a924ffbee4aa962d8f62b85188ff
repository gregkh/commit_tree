cdc-wdm: Fix more races on the read path

We must not allow the input buffer length to change while we're
shuffling the buffer contents.  We also mustn't clear the WDM_READ
flag after more data might have arrived.  Therefore move both of these
into the spinlocked region at the bottom of wdm_read().

When reading desc->length without holding the iuspin lock, use
ACCESS_ONCE() to ensure the compiler doesn't re-read it with
inconsistent results.
