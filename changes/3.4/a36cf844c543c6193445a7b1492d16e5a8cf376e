firmware_class: Move request_firmware_nowait() to workqueues

Oddly enough a work_struct was already part of the firmware_work
structure but nobody was using it. Instead of creating a new
kthread for each request_firmware_nowait() call just schedule the
work on the system workqueue. This should avoid some overhead
in forking new threads when they're not strictly necessary.
