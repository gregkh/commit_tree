perf tools: Fix getrusage() related build failure on glibc trunk

On a system running glibc trunk perf doesn't build:

    CC builtin-sched.o
builtin-sched.c: In function ‘get_cpu_usage_nsec_parent’: builtin-sched.c:399:16: error: storage size of ‘ru’ isn’t known builtin-sched.c:403:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘getrusage’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    [...]

Fix it by including sys/resource.h.
