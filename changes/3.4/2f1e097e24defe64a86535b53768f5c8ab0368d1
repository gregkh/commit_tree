X86: Introduce HW-Pstate scattered cpuid feature

It is rather similar to CPB (boot capability) feature
and exists since fam10h (can be looked up in AMD's BKDG).

The feature is needed for powernow-k8 to cleanup init functions and to
provide proper autoloading matching with the new x86cpu modalias
feature.
