rcu: Add RCU_NONIDLE() for idle-loop RCU read-side critical sections

RCU, RCU-bh, and RCU-sched read-side critical sections are forbidden
in the inner idle loop, that is, between the rcu_idle_enter() and the
rcu_idle_exit() -- RCU will happily ignore any such read-side critical
sections.  However, things like powertop need tracepoints in the inner
idle loop.

This commit therefore provides an RCU_NONIDLE() macro that can be used to
wrap code in the idle loop that requires RCU read-side critical sections.
