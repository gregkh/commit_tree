be2net: allocate more headroom in incoming skbs

Allocation of 64 bytes in skb headroom is not enough if we have to pull
ethernet + ipv6 + tcp headers, and/or extra tunneling header.

Its currently not noticed because netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align(64) give us
more room, thanks to power-of-two kmalloc() roundups.

Make sure we ask for 128 bytes so that side effects of upcoming patches
from Ian Campbell dont decrease benet rx performance, because of extra
skb head reallocations.
