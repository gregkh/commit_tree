Bluetooth: mgmt: Fix updating EIR when updating the name

Whenever we update the local device name the EIR data also needs to be
updated to reflect this. The update_eir() function in mgmt.c depends on
hdev->dev_name to be up to date so the patch also makes sure that the
mgmt function is called from hci_event.c after the update has happened.
