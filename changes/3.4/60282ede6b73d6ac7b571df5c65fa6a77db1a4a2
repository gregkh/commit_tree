ASoC: imx: move eukrea audmux call into ASoC machine driver

It moves eukrea audmux configuration call from board file into ASoC
machine driver eukrea-tlv320, so that it gets aligned wm1133-ev1 and
mx27vis-aic32x4, and more importantly it will ease the moving of audmux
into sound/soc/imx as a platform driver later.
