tools/include: Add byteshift headers for endian access

There are various hostprogs in the kernel that are rolling their own
implementations of {get,put}_unaligned_le*(). Copy the byteshift
headers from include/linux/unaligned so that they can all use a single
implementation.

This requires changing some of the data types to the userspace
exported ones (u32 -> __u32, etc).
