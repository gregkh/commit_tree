ASoC: core: Split the union for CODEC/platform in the DAI

There's now core code which falls back to global CODEC operations for
DAI calls that needs to be able to tell if it's dealing with a CPU or
CODEC DAI and given the small number of DAIs in a typical system and
overall memory usage pattern saving a pointer per DAI is really not
worth the effort.
