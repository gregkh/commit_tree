mmc: sdhci-s3c: use devm_ functions

The various devm_ functions allocate memory that is released when a driver
detaches.  This patch uses these functions for data that is allocated in
the probe function of a platform device and is only freed in the remove
function.

By using devm_ioremap, it also removes a potential memory leak, because
there was no call to iounmap in the probe function.

The call to platform_get_resource was moved just to make it closer to the
place where its result it used.
