PM / Domains: Provide a dummy dev_gpd_data() when generic domains are not used

dev_gpd_data() is a generic macro, also useful for drivers. Hence it should
be available also when CONFIG_PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS is not selected. OTOH,
to_gpd_data() is so far unused outside of the generic PM domain code and
does not seem to be very useful without CONFIG_PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS.
