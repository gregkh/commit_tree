ARM: 7332/1: extract out code patch function from kprobes

Extract out the code patching code from kprobes so that it can be used
from the jump label code.  Additionally, the separated code:

 - Uses the IS_ENABLED() macros instead of the #ifdefs for THUMB2
   support

 - Unifies the two separate functions in kprobes, providing one function
   that uses stop_machine() internally, and one that can be called from
   stop_machine() directly

 - Patches the text on all CPUs only on processors requiring software
   broadcasting of cache operations
