[media] m88rs2000 ver 1.13 Correct deseqc and tuner gain functions

Remove incorrect SEC_MINI_B settings-TODO complete this section.

Correct break and remove return -EINVAL within set tone. It appears
there is a bug that occasionally something other than ON/OFF is
sent stalling the driver. Just continue and write back registers.

Set register b2 in setup. This is the set voltage pin which
isn't used in lmedm04 driver but it is always set to 0x1.

Correct the if statements in set_tuner_rf.
