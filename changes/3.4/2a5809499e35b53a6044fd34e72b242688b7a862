asix: Fix tx transfer padding for full-speed USB

The asix.c USB Ethernet driver avoids ending a tx transfer with a zero-
length packet by appending a four-byte padding to transfers whose length
is a multiple of maxpacket. However, the hard-coded 512 byte maxpacket
length is valid for high-speed USB only; full-speed USB uses 64 byte
packets.
