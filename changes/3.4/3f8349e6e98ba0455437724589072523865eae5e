mfd: Clear twl6030 IRQ status register only once

TWL6030 family of PMIC use a shadow interrupt status register
while kernel processes the current interrupt event.
However, any write(0 or 1) to register INT_STS_A, INT_STS_B or
INT_STS_C clears all 3 interrupt status registers.

Since clear of the interrupt is done on 32k clk, depending on I2C
bus speed, we could in-adverently clear the status of a interrupt
status pending on shadow register in the current implementation.
This is due to the fact that multi-byte i2c write operation into
three seperate status register could result in multiple load
and clear of status and result in lost interrupts.

Instead, doing a single byte write to INT_STS_A register with 0x0
will clear all three interrupt status registers without the related
risk.
