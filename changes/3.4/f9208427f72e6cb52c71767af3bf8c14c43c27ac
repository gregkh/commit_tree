PPC: Fix race in mtmsr paravirt implementation

The current implementation of mtmsr and mtmsrd are racy in that it does:

  * check (int_pending == 0)
  ---> host sets int_pending = 1 <---
  * write shared page
  * done

while instead we should check for int_pending after the shared page is written.
