HID: default HID_BATTERY_STRENGTH to no

Commit 4f5ca836b "HID: hid-input: add support for HID devices reporting
Battery Strength" added the CONFIG_HID_BATTERY_STRENGTH option to report
the battery strength of HID devices.  The commit log explicitly mentions
it not working properly with recent userspace, but it is default y
anyway.  This is rather odd, and actually causes problems on real
systems.

This works around Fedora bug
