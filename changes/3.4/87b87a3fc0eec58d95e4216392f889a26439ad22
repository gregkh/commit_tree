mmc: sdhci: refine non-removable card checking for card detection

Commit c79396c191bc19 ("mmc: sdhci: prevent card detection activity
for non-removable cards") disables card detection where the cards
are marked as non-removable.

This makes sense, but the implementation detail of calling
mmc_card_is_removable() causes some problems, because
mmc_card_is_removable() is overloaded with CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
semantics.

In the OLPC XO case, we need CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME because our root
filesystem is stored on SD, but we also have external SD card slots
where we want automatic card detection.

Refine the check to only apply to hosts marked as MMC_CAP_NONREMOVABLE,
which is defined to mean that the card is *really* nonremovable. This
could be revisited in future if we find a way to improve
CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME semantics.
