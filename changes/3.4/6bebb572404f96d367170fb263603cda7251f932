ARM: 7268/1: integrator: defconfig for both AP and CP

This updates the Integrator defconfig to include the hardware
found on the Integrator/CP: SMC91X, CLCD, MMCI/PL180. Further
the sometimes disrupting VGA_CONSOLE is disabled (those who
have a VGA card can enable it) and typical default VFAT
layouts of the MMC cards are supported by enabling VFAT and
CP437 encoding of the file system.

After this my default kernels boot successfully on Integrator
AP and CP alike.
