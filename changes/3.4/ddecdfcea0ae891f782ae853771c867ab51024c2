ARM: 7259/3: net: JIT compiler for packet filters

Based of Matt Evans's PPC64 implementation.

The compiler generates ARM instructions but interworking is
supported for Thumb2 kernels.

Supports both little and big endian. Unaligned loads are emitted
for ARMv6+. Not all the BPF opcodes that deal with ancillary data
are supported. The scratch memory of the filter lives on the stack.
Hardware integer division is used if it is available.

Enabled in the same way as for x86-64 and PPC64:

	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable

A value greater than 1 enables opcode output.
