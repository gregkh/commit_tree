cpupower: Fix number of idle states

The number of idle states was wrong.
The POLL idle state (on X86) was missed out:
Number of idle states: 4
Available idle states: C1-NHM C3-NHM C6-NHM

While the POLL is not a real idle state, its
statistics should still be shown. It's now also
explained in a detailed manpage.
This should fix a bug of missing the first idle
state on other archs.
