ARM: 7386/1: jump_label: fixup for rename to static_key

c5905afb0 ("static keys: Introduce 'struct static_key'...") renamed
struct jump_label_key to struct static_key.  Fixup ARM for this to
eliminate these build warnings:

  include/linux/jump_label.h:113:2:
  warning: passing argument 1 of 'arch_static_branch' from incompatible pointer type
  include/asm/jump_label.h:17:82:
  note: expected 'struct jump_label_key *' but argument is of type 'struct static_key *'
