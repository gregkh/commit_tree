dmaengine/amba-pl08x : reset phychan_hold on terminate all

When a client calls pl08x_control with DMA_TERMINATE_ALL, it is correct
to terminate and release the phy channel currently in use (if one is in use),
but the phychan_hold counter must also be reset (otherwise it could get
trapped in an unbalanced state).
