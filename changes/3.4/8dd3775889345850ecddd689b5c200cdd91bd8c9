NFSv4.1: Clean ups and bugfixes for the pNFS read/writeback/commit code

Move more pnfs-isms out of the generic commit code.

Bugfixes:

- filelayout_scan_commit_lists doesn't need to get/put the lseg.
  In fact since it is run under the inode->i_lock, the lseg_put()
  can deadlock.

- Ensure that we distinguish between what needs to be done for
  commit-to-data server and what needs to be done for commit-to-MDS
  using the new flag PG_COMMIT_TO_DS. Otherwise we may end up calling
  put_lseg() on a bucket for a struct nfs_page that got written
  through the MDS.

- Fix a case where we were using list_del() on an nfs_page->wb_list
  instead of list_del_init().

- filelayout_initiate_commit needs to call filelayout_commit_release
  on error instead of the mds_ops->rpc_release(). Otherwise it won't
  clear the commit lock.

Cleanups:

- Let the files layout manage the commit lists for the pNFS case.
  Don't expose stuff like pnfs_choose_commit_list, and the fact
  that the commit buckets hold references to the layout segment
  in common code.

- Cast out the put_lseg() calls for the struct nfs_read/write_data->lseg
  into the pNFS layer from whence they came.

- Let the pNFS layer manage the NFS_INO_PNFS_COMMIT bit.
