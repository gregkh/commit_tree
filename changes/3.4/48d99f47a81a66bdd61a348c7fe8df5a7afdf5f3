ARM: orion5x: Fix GPIO enable bits for MPP9

Commit 554cdaefd1cf7bb54b209c4e68c7cec87ce442a9 ('ARM: orion5x: Refactor
mpp code to use common orion platform mpp.') seems to have accidentally
inverted the GPIO valid bits for MPP9 (only).  For the mv2120 platform
which uses MPP9 as a GPIO LED device, this results in the error:

[   12.711476] leds-gpio: probe of leds-gpio failed with error -22
