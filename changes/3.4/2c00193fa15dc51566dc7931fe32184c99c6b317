staging:iio:events: Use kfifo for event queue

The current IIO event code uses a list to emulate FIFO like behavior.
Just use a kfifo directly instead to implement the event queue. As part of this
patch the maximum of events in the queue is increased from 10 to 16 since kfifo
requires a power of two for the number of FIFO elements.
