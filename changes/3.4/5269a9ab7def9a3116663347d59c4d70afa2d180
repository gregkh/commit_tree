irq_domain: fix type mismatch in debugfs output format

sizeof(void*) returns an unsigned long, but it was being used as a width parameter to a "%-*s" format string which requires an int.  On 64 bit platforms this causes a type mismatch:

    linux/kernel/irq/irqdomain.c:575: warning: field width should have type
    'int', but argument 6 has type 'long unsigned int'

This change casts the size to an int so printf gets the right data type.
