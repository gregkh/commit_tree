ceph: encode type in vxattr callback routines

The names of the callback functions used for virtual extended
attributes are based only on the last component of the attribute
name.  Because of the way these are defined, this precludes allowing
a single (lowest) attribute name for different callbacks, dependent
on the type of file being operated on.  (For example, it might be
nice to support both "ceph.dir.layout" and "ceph.file.layout".)

Just change the callback names to avoid this problem.
