[SCSI] libsas: don't recover end devices attached to disabled phys

If userspace has decided to disable a phy the kernel should honor that
and not inadvertantly re-enable the phy via error recovery.  This is
more straightforward in the sata case where link recovery (via
libata-eh) is separate from sas_task cancelling in libsas-eh.  Teach
libsas to accept -ENODEV as a successful response from I_T_nexus_reset
('successful' in terms of not escalating further).

This is a more comprehensive fix then "libsas: don't recover 'gone'
devices in sas_ata_hard_reset()", as it is no longer sata-specific.

aic94xx does check the return value from sas_phy_reset() so if the phy
is disabled we proceed with clearing the I_T_nexus.
