rbd: restore previous rbd id sequence behavior

It used to be that selecting a new unique identifier for an added
rbd device required searching all existing ones to find the highest
id is used.  A recent change made that unnecessary, but made it
so that id's used were monotonically non-decreasing.  It's a bit
more pleasant to have smaller rbd id's though, and this change
makes ids get allocated as they were before--each new id is one more
than the maximum currently in use.
