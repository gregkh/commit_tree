powerpc/eeh: Platform dependent EEH operations

EEH has been implemented on RTAS-compliant pSeries platform.
That's to say, the EEH operations will be implemented through RTAS
calls eventually. The situation limited feasible extension on EEH.
In order to support EEH on multiple platforms like pseries and powernv
simutaneously. We have to split the platform dependent EEH options
up out of current implementation.

The patch addresses supporting EEH on multiple platforms. The pseries
platform dependent EEH operations will be abstracted by struct eeh_ops.
EEH core components will be built based on the registered EEH operations.
With the mechanism, what the individual platform needs to do is implement
platform dependent EEH operations.

For now, the pseries platform is covered under the mechanism. That means
we have to think about other platforms to support EEH, like powernv.
Besides, we only have framework for the mechanism and we have to implement
it for pseries platform later.
