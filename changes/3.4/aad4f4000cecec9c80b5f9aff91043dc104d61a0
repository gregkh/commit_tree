PCI: Add helper macro for pci_register_driver boilerplate

This patch introduces the module_pci_driver macro which is a convenience
macro for PCI driver modules similar to module_platform_driver. It is
intended to be used by drivers which init/exit section does nothing but
register/unregister the PCI driver. By using this macro it is possible
to eliminate a few lines of boilerplate code per PCI driver.

Based on work done by Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de> for other
busses (i2c and spi).
