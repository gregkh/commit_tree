ARM: 7414/1: SMP: prevent use of the console when using idmap_pgd

Commit 4e8ee7de227e3ab9a72040b448ad728c5428a042 (ARM: SMP: use
idmap_pgd for mapping MMU enable during secondary booting)
switched secondary boot to use idmap_pgd, which is initialized
during early_initcall, instead of a page table initialized during
__cpu_up.  This causes idmap_pgd to contain the static mappings
but be missing all dynamic mappings.

If a console is registered that creates a dynamic mapping, the
printk in secondary_start_kernel will trigger a data abort on
the missing mapping before the exception handlers have been
initialized, leading to a hang.  Initial boot is not affected
because no consoles have been registered, and resume is usually
not affected because the offending console is suspended.
Onlining a cpu with hotplug triggers the problem.

A workaround is to the printk in secondary_start_kernel until
after the page tables have been switched back to init_mm.
