ext4: fix trimmed block count accunting

Currently when there is not enough free blocks in the block group to
discard (grp->bb_free < minlen) the 'trimmed' is bumped up anyway with
the number of discarded blocks from the previous iteration. Fix this
by bumping up 'trimmed' only if the ext4_trim_all_free() was actually
run.
