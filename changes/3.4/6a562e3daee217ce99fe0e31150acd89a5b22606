Revert "drm/i915: reenable gmbus on gen3+ again"

This reverts commit c3dfefa0a6d235bd465309e12f4c56ea16e71111.

gmbus in 3.4 has simply too many known issues:
- gmbus is too noisy, we need to rework the logging:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48248
- zero-length writes cause an OOPS, and they are
  userspace-triggerable:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/30/176
- same for zero-length reads:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48269

We can try again for 3.5.
