xz: Enable BCJ filters on SPARC and 32-bit x86

The BCJ filters were meant to be enabled already on these
archs, but the xz_wrap.sh script was buggy. Enabling the
filters should give smaller kernel images.

xz_wrap.sh will now use $SRCARCH instead of $ARCH to detect
the architecture. That way it doesn't need to care about the
subarchs (like i386 vs. x86_64) since the BCJ filters don't
care either.
