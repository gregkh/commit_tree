fsl/mpic: Document and use the "big-endian" device-tree flag

The MPIC code checks for a "big-endian" property and sets the flag
MPIC_BIG_ENDIAN if one is present, although prior to the "mpic->flags"
fixup that would never have worked anways.

Unfortunately, even now that it works properly, the Freescale mpic
device-node (the "PowerQUICC-III"-compatible one) does not specify it,
so all of the board ports need to manually pass it to mpic_alloc().

Document the flag and add it to the pq3 device tree.  Existing code will
still need to pass the MPIC_BIG_ENDIAN flag because their dtb may not
have this property, but new platforms shouldn't need to do so.
