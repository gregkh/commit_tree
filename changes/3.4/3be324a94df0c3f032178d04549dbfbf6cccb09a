samsung-laptop: make the dmi check less strict

This enable the driver for everything that look like
a laptop and is from vendor "SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD.".
Note that laptop supported by samsung-q10 seem to have a different
vendor strict.

Also remove every log output until we know that we have a SABI interface
(except if the driver is forced to load, or debug is enabled).

Keeping a whitelist of laptop with a model granularity is something that can't
work without close vendor cooperation (and we don't have that).
