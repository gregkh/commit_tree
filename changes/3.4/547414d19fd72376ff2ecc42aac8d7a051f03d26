md/raid10: remove unnecessary smp_mb() from end_sync_write

Recent commit 4ca40c2ce099e4f1ce3 (md/raid10: Allow replacement device ...)
added an smp_mb in end_sync_write.
This was to close a possible race with raid10_remove_disk.
However there is no such race as it is never attempted to remove a
disk while resync (or recovery) is happening.
so the smp_mb is just noise.
