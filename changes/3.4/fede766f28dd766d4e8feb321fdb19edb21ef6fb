Btrfs: avoid deadlocks from GFP_KERNEL allocations during btrfs_real_readdir

Btrfs has an optimization where it will preallocate dentries during
readdir to fill in enough information to open the inode without an extra
lookup.

But, we're calling d_alloc, which is doing GFP_KERNEL allocations, and
that leads to deadlocks because our readdir code has tree locks held.

For now, disable this optimization.  We'll fix the gfp mask in the next
merge window.
