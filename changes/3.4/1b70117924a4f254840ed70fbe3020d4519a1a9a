powerpc: Improve behaviour of irq tracing on 64-bit exception entry

Some exceptions would unconditionally disable interrupts on entry,
which is fine, but calling lockdep every time not only adds more
overhead than strictly needed, but also means we get quite a few
"redudant" disable logged, which makes it hard to spot the really
bad ones.

So instead, split the macro used by the exception code into a
normal one and a separate one used when CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS is
enabled, and make the later skip th tracing if interrupts were
already disabled.
