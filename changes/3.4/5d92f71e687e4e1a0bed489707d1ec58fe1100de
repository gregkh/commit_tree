Staging: android: timed_gpio: Fix resource leak in timed_gpio_probe error paths

If gpio_request fails, we need to free all allocated resources.
Current code uses wrong array index to access gpio_data array.
So current code actually frees gpio_data[i].gpio by j times.

This patch moves the error handling code to err_out and thus improves
readability.
