ktest: Fix SWITCH_TO_GOOD to also reboot the machine

When the option SWITCH_TO_GOOD is set, it will be called when the system
needs to reboot to the good server. But currently, this keeps the reboot
from happening. The SWITCH_TO_GOOD is just a way to get to a new kernel,
it may not mean to not reboot.
