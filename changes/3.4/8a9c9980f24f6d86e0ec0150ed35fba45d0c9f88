xfs: log timestamp updates

Timestamps on regular files are the last metadata that XFS does not update
transactionally.  Now that we use the delaylog mode exclusively and made
the log scode scale extremly well there is no need to bypass that code for
timestamp updates.  Logging all updates allows to drop a lot of code, and
will allow for further performance improvements later on.

Note that this patch drops optimized handling of fdatasync - it will be
added back in a separate commit.
