rcu: Print scheduling-clock information on RCU CPU stall-warning messages

There have been situations where RCU CPU stall warnings were caused by
issues in scheduling-clock timer initialization.  To make it easier to
track these down, this commit causes the RCU CPU stall-warning messages
to print out the number of scheduling-clock interrupts taken in the
current grace period for each stalled CPU.
