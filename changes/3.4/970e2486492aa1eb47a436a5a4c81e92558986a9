Documentation: remove references to /etc/modprobe.conf

Usage of /etc/modprobe.conf file was deprecated by module-init-tools and
is no longer parsed by new kmod tool. References to this file are
replaced in Documentation, comments and Kconfig according to the
context.

There are also some references to the old /etc/modules.conf from 2.4
kernels that are being removed.
