ARM: at91/tc/clocksource: Add 32 bit variant to Timer Counter

Some SoC have a 32 bit variant of Timer Counter Blocks. We do not
need the chaining of two 16 bit counters anymore for them.

The SoC nature is deduced from the device tree "compatible" string.
For non-device-tree configurations, backward compatibility is maintained
by using the default 16 bit counter configuration.

This patch addresses both the atmel_tclib and its user: tcb_clksrc
clocksource.
