md/raid10: set dev_sectors properly when resizing devices in array.

raid10 stores dev_sectors in 'conf' separately from the one in
'mddev' because it can have a very significant effect on block
addressing and so need to be updated carefully.

However raid10_resize isn't updating it at all!

To update it correctly, we need to make sure it is a proper
multiple of the chunksize taking various details of the layout
in to account.
This calculation is currently done in setup_conf.   So split it
out from there and call it from raid10_resize as well.
Then set conf->dev_sectors properly.
