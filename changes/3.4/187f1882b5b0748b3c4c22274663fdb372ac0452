BUG: headers with BUG/BUG_ON etc. need linux/bug.h

If a header file is making use of BUG, BUG_ON, BUILD_BUG_ON, or any
other BUG variant in a static inline (i.e. not in a #define) then
that header really should be including <linux/bug.h> and not just
expecting it to be implicitly present.

We can make this change risk-free, since if the files using these
headers didn't have exposure to linux/bug.h already, they would have
been causing compile failures/warnings.
