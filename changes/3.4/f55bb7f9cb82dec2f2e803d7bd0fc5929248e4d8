unix: Support peeking offset for datagram and seqpacket sockets

The sk_peek_off manipulations are protected with the unix_sk->readlock mutex.
This mutex is enough since all we need is to syncronize setting the offset
vs reading the queue head. The latter is fully covered with the mentioned lock.

The recently added __skb_recv_datagram's offset is used to pick the skb to
read the data from.
