mm: raise MemFree by reverting percpu_pagelist_fraction to 0

Why is there less MemFree than there used to be?  It perturbed a test,
so I've just been bisecting linux-next, and now find the offender went
upstream yesterday.

Commit 93278814d359 "mm: fix division by 0 in percpu_pagelist_fraction()"
mistakenly initialized percpu_pagelist_fraction to the sysctl's minimum 8,
which leaves 1/8th of memory on percpu lists (on each cpu??); but most of
us expect it to be left unset at 0 (and it's not then used as a divisor).

  MemTotal: 8061476kB  8061476kB  8061476kB  8061476kB  8061476kB  8061476kB
  Repetitive test with percpu_pagelist_fraction 8:
  MemFree:  6948420kB  6237172kB  6949696kB  6840692kB  6949048kB  6862984kB
  Same test with percpu_pagelist_fraction back to 0:
  MemFree:  7945000kB  7944908kB  7948568kB  7949060kB  7948796kB  7948812kB
