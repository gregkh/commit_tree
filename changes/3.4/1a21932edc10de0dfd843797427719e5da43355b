ARM: OMAP: igep0020: fix smsc911x dummy regulator id

id 0 is already used and causes errors at boot:

WARNING: at fs/sysfs/dir.c:508 sysfs_add_one+0x9c/0xac()
sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/platform/reg-fixed-voltage.0'

Fix it by using the next available one (id=1).

This was caused by 5b3689f4 (ARM: OMAP2+: smsc911x: Add fixed
board regulators) that did not account for some regulators
already being used.
