rtlwifi: Preallocate USB read buffers and eliminate kalloc in read routine

The current version of rtlwifi for USB operations uses kmalloc to
acquire a 32-bit buffer for each read of the device. When
_usb_read_sync() is called with the rcu_lock held, the result is
a "sleeping function called from invalid context" BUG. This is
reported for two cases in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42775.
The first case has the lock originating from within rtlwifi and could
be fixed by rearranging the locking; however, the second originates from
within mac80211. The kmalloc() call is removed from _usb_read_sync()
by creating a ring buffer pointer in the private area and
allocating the buffer data in the probe routine.
