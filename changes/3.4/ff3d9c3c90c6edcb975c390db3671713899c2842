staging: sep: SEP update

This is basically a rewrite so there isn't a nice easy to present way of
providing this as a patch series. This patch is a pull of Mark's new driver into
the upstream staging area. On top of that are a series of patches by
Andy Shevchenko to make it build on the current tree, fix a few things and
even get it passed sparse.

The new driver supports the kernel crypto layer, passes the coding style checks,
passes human taste checks and has proper kernel-doc formatted comments.

I've then folded back in some later fixes it was missing that got applied to
to the kernel tree.

This should be ready for more serious review with a view to migration from
the staging tree shortly.
