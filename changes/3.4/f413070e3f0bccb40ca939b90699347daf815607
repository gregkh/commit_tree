fbdev: da8xx: add support for SP10Q010 display

Add timing data for Hitachi SP10Q010 display and allow configuration
of the 4bpp palette. For 4bpp framebuffer enable reversed order of
pixels in a byte. This requires defining FB_CFB_REV_PIXELS_IN_BYTE
and additionally setting var.nonstd to the value FB_NONSTD_REV_PIX_IN_B.
Note that it is not enough to set da8xx_fb_var.nonstd to this value
statically, since FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO ioctl might pass var struct with
.nonstd field set to zero or another value. Therefore this setting must
be adjusted in fb_check_var() according to the requested bpp value.
