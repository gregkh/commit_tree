ARM: LPC32xx: clock.c: Fix mutex lock issues

This patch fixes the mutex issue in clock.c, as done in Kevin Wells' original
driver update:

In some cases, the clock drivers could grab a mutex twice in an improper
context. This patch changes the mutex mechanism to a simple irq lock/unlock
mechanism and removes un-needed locks from some functions.
