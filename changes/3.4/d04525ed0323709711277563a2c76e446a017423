dma: mxs-dma: enable channel in device_issue_pending call

Enable channel in device_issue_pending call, so that the order between
cookie assignment and channel enabling can be ensured naturally.

It fixes the mxs gpmi-nand breakage which is caused by the incorrect
order of cookie assigning and channel enabling.
