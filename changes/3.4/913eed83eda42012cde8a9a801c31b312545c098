ext4: fix start and len arguments handling in ext4_trim_fs()

The overflow can happen when we are calling get_group_no_and_offset()
which stores the group number in the ext4_grpblk_t type which is
actually int. However when the blocknr is big enough the group number
might be bigger than ext4_grpblk_t resulting in overflow. This will
most likely happen with FITRIM default argument len = ULLONG_MAX.

Fix this by using "end" variable instead of "start+len" as it is easier
to get right and specifically check that the end is not beyond the end
of the file system, so we are sure that the result of
get_group_no_and_offset() will not overflow. Otherwise truncate it to
the size of the file system.
