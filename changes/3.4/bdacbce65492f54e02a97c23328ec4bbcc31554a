ARM: OMAP2+: smsc911x: Remove regulator support from gmpc-smsc911x

Adding in support for regulators here creates several headaches.
 - Boards that declare their own regulator cannot use this function.
 - Multiple calls to this function require special handling.
 - Boards that declare id's other than '0' need special handling.

Now that there is a simple regulator_register_fixed, we can push
this registration back into the board files.
