dccp ccid-3: replace incorrect BUG_ON

This replaces an unjustified BUG_ON(), which could get triggered under normal
conditions: X_calc can be 0 when p > 0. X would in this case be set to the
minimum, s/t_mbi. Its replacement avoids t_ipi = 0 (unbounded sending rate).

Thanks to Jordi, Victor and Xavier who reported this.
