Bluetooth: Fix init request completion with old controllers

With Bluetooth 1.1 controllers the last command in the HCI init sequence
will be a write_local_name, however there was no callback to indicate
init request completion in this case. This patch fixes the issue by
adding the necessary callback to the write_local_name_complete handler.
