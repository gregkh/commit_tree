NFSv4.0: Re-establish the callback channel on NFS4ERR_CB_PATHDOWN

When the NFSv4.0 server tells us that it can no-longer talk to us
on the callback channel, we should attempt a new SETCLIENTID in
order to re-transmit the callback channel information.

Note that as long as we do not change the boot verifier, this is
a safe procedure; the server is required to keep our state.

Also move the function nfs_handle_cb_pathdown to fs/nfs/nfs4state.c,
and change the name in order to mark it as being specific to NFSv4.0.
