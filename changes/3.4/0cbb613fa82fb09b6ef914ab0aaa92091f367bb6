staging: fix powerpc linux-next break on zsmalloc

linux/vmalloc.h added to zsmalloc-main.c to resolve implicit
declaration errors.

X86 dependency added to zsmalloc and dependent drivers zcache and zram.

This X86 only requirement is not ideal.  Working to find portable
functions for __flush_tlb_one and set_pte.
