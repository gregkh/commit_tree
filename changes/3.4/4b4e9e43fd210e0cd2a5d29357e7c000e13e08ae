regmap: rbtree: Fix register default look-up in sync

The code currently passes the register offset in the current block to
regcache_lookup_reg. This works fine as long as there is only one block and with
base register of 0, but in all other cases it will look-up the default for a
wrong register, which can cause unnecessary register writes. This patch fixes
it by passing the actual register number to regcache_lookup_reg.
