perf tools: Do not disable members of group event

When event group is enabled for forked task (i.e. no target task/cpu
was specified) all events were disabled and marked ->enable_on_exec.
However they wouldn't be counted at all since only group leader will
be enabled on exec actually.

In contrast to perf stat, perf record doesn't have a real problem
as it enables all the event before proceeding. But it needs to be
fixed anyway IMHO.
