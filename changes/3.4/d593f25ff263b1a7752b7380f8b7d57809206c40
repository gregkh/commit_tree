irq_domain: Centralize definition of irq_dispose_mapping()

Several architectures define their own empty irq_dispose_mapping().  Since
the irq_domain code is centralized now, there is little need to do so.  This
patch removes them and creates a new empty copy when !CONFIG_IRQ_DOMAIN is
selected.

The patch also means that IRQ_DOMAIN becomes selectable on all architectures.
