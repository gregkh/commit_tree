Staging, rtl8192e, softmac: remove redundant memset and fix mem leak

In drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib_softmac.c::rtllib_rx_assoc_resp()
we allocate memory for 'network' with kzalloc() and then proceed to
zero the already zeroed mem we got from kzalloc() with
memset(). That's redundant, so remove the memset()

We also fail to kfree() the memory we allocated for 'network' if we do not enter

  if (ieee->current_network.qos_data.supported == 1) {

and the variable then goes out of scope.

To fix that I simply moved the kfree() that was inside that 'if'
statement to instead be just after it. It then covers both the case
where we take the branch and when we don't.
