sched: Ensure cpu_power periodic update

With a lot of small tasks, the softirq sched is nearly never called
when no_hz is enabled. In this case load_balance() is mainly called
with the newly_idle mode which doesn't update the cpu_power.

Add a next_update field which ensure a maximum update period when
there is short activity.

Having stale cpu_power information can skew the load-balancing
decisions, this is cured by the guaranteed update.
