KVM: Simplify ifndef conditional usage in __kvm_set_memory_region()

Narrow down the controlled text inside the conditional so that it will
include lpage_info and rmap stuff only.

For this we change the way we check whether the slot is being created
from "if (npages && !new.rmap)" to "if (npages && !old.npages)".

We also stop checking if lpage_info is NULL when we create lpage_info
because we do it from inside the slot creation code block.
