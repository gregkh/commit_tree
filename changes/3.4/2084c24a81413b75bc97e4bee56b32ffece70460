do not export kernel's NULL #define to userspace

GCC's NULL is actually __null, which allows detecting some questionable
NULL usage and warn about it.  Moreover each platform/compiler should
have its own stddef.h anyway (which is different from linux/stddef.h).

So there's no good reason to leak kernel's NULL to userspace and
override what the compiler provides.
