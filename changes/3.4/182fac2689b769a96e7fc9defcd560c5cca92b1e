net/ceph: Only clear SOCK_NOSPACE when there is sufficient space in the socket buffer

The Ceph messenger would sometimes queue multiple work items to write
data to a socket when the socket buffer was full.

Fix this problem by making ceph_write_space() use SOCK_NOSPACE in the
same way that net/core/stream.c:sk_stream_write_space() does, i.e.,
clearing it only when sufficient space is available in the socket buffer.
