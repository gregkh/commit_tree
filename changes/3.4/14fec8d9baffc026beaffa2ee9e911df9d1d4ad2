ath9k_hw: remove duplicate initvals

Comparing SHA1 checksums of the initval tables has shown that there are many
tables that are 100% identical.

iniBank{0,1,2,3,7} and iniBB_RfGain are shared by AR5416, AR913x, AR9160
iniBank6 is shared between AR5416 and AR9160
iniBank6TPC is shared between AR913x and AR9160

iniPcieSerdes is the same for all AR9002 based devices

The CCK FIR coefficients are shared between AR9271 and AR9287

Getting rid of those duplicates saves about 7.5k uncompressed (on MIPS).

For AR9003 and later there are some duplicates as well, but I've decided to
leave them in for now, as the initvals for those chips are still actively
maintained by QCA.
