USB: create module_usb_serial_driver macro

Now that Alan Stern has cleaned up the usb serial driver registration,
we have the ability to create a module_usb_serial_driver macro to make
things a bit simpler, like the other *_driver macros created.

But, as we need two functions here, we can't reuse the existing
module_driver() macro, so we need to roll our own.

Here's a patch implementing module_usb_serial_driver() and it converts
the pl2303 driver to use it, showing a nice cleanup.
