staging: android/lowmemorykiller: Don't grab tasklist_lock

Grabbing tasklist_lock has its disadvantages, i.e. it blocks
process creation and destruction. If there are lots of processes,
blocking doesn't sound as a great idea.

For LMK, it is sufficient to surround tasks list traverse with
rcu_read_{,un}lock().

>From now on using force_sig() is not safe, as it can race with an
already exiting task, so we use send_sig() now. As a downside, it
won't kill PID namespace init processes, but that's not what we
want anyway.
