ath6kl: Use a mutex_lock to avoid race in diabling and handling irq

Currently this race is handled but in a messy way an atomic
variable is being checked in a loop which sleeps upto ms
in every iteration. Remove this logic and use a mutex
to make sure irq is not disabled when irq handling is in
progress.
