[SCSI] libfc: update fc_host mfs along with updating lport->mfs

Currently fc_host mfs is not getting updated in
case its changed during FLOGI and that leaves fc_host
to show its initial old value in sysfs, so instead
have fc_host mfs updated along with updating lport mfs
during FLOGI.

Also in case of bad mfs during flogi, error out
instead of continuing with flogi.

[ Changes made by Robert Love: condition to '>=' and
  added printing of lport->mfs in DBG statement. FLOGI
  resp processing failed without being able to compare
  FCoE MFS 2112 against an incoming MFS of 2112 ]
