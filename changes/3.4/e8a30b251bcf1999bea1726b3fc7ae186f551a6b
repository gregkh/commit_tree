ARM: OMAP2+: Remove __init from DSI mux functions

Commit d1589f0912533e6cb2ac8fd6f1feb3d5989fe8cb (ARM: OMAP2+: Mark
omap_hsmmc_init and omap_mux related functions as __init) changed DSI
muxing functions to __init. This doesn't work, as the muxing functions
are used every time a DSI display is enabled or disabled.

This patch removes the __inits from DSI mux functions that were
accidentally marked as __init, and makes omap4_hdmi_mux_pads __init
like it should be.
