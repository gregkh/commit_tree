[SCSI] scsi_lib: use correct DMA device in __scsi_alloc_queue
 
Caused a regression where we oops in every legacy mode SCSI host driver
because they supply a NULL pointer to scsi_add_host().  Fix this by checking
for the NULL in scsi_add_host_with_dma() and changing the DMA device to being
the platform_bus in that case (which replicates the original behaviour).
