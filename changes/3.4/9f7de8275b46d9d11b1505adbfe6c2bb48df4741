idr: make idr_get_next() good for rcu_read_lock()

Make one small adjustment to idr_get_next(): take the height from the top
layer (stable under RCU) instead of from the root (unprotected by RCU), as
idr_find() does: so that it can be used with RCU locking.  Copied comment
on RCU locking from idr_find().
