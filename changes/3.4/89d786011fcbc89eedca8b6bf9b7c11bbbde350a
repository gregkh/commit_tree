m68knommu: move and fix the 68VZ328 platform bootlogo.h

The 68EZ328/bootlogo.h is not actually used in the 68EZ328 platform code
at all. It is used by the 68VZ328 platform code though, so move it to be
with the rest of the 68VZ328 platform code.

Commit c0e0c89c089f4bd66dbbd1a44da90abe74fe3f02 ("fix broken boot logo
inclusion") modified the bootlogo code to not be included in asm code.
Modify 68VZ328/bootlogo.h so that the bootlogo bit map is named correctly
for direct use in the C code.
