epoll: comment the funky #ifdef

Looking for a bug in -rt, I stumbled across this code here from: commit
2dfa4eeab0fc ("epoll keyed wakeups: teach epoll about hints coming with
the wakeup key"), specifically:

  #ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC
  static inline void ep_wake_up_nested(wait_queue_head_t *wqueue,
                                      unsigned long events, int subclass)
  {
         unsigned long flags;

         spin_lock_irqsave_nested(&wqueue->lock, flags, subclass);
         wake_up_locked_poll(wqueue, events);
         spin_unlock_irqrestore(&wqueue->lock, flags);
  }
  #else
  static inline void ep_wake_up_nested(wait_queue_head_t *wqueue,
                                      unsigned long events, int subclass)
  {
         wake_up_poll(wqueue, events);
  }
  #endif

You change the function of ep_wake_up_nested() depending on whether
CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC is set or not.  This looks awfully suspicious,
and there's no comment to explain why.  I initially thought that this
was trying to fool lockdep, and hiding a real bug.

Investigating it, I found the creation of wake_up_nested() (which no
longer exists) but was created for the sole purpose of epoll and its
strange wake ups, as explained in commit 0ccf831cbee9 ("lockdep:
annotate epoll")

Although the commit message says "annotate epoll" the change log is much
better at explaining what is happening than what is in the actual code.
Thus a comment is really necessary here.  And to save the time of other
developers from having to go trudging through the git logs trying to
figure out why this code exists.

I took parts of the change log and placed it into a comment above the
affected code.  This will make the description of what is happening more
visible to new developers that have to look at this code for the first
time.
