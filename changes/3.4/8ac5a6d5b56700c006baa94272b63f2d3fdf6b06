drm/i915: Don't lock panel registers when downclocking

This patch replaces the locking from the downclock routines with an assert
to ensure the registers are indeed unlocked. Without this patch, pre-SNB
devices would lock the registers when downclocking which would cause a
WARNING on suspend/resume with downclocking enabled.

Note: To hit this bug, you need to have lvds downclocking enabled.
