staging: zcache: avoid AB-BA deadlock condition

Commit 9256a47 fixed a deadlock condition, being sure that the buddy
list spinlock is always taken before the page spinlock.

However in zbud_free_and_delist() locking order is the opposite
(page lock -> list lock).

Possible unsafe locking scenario (reported by lockdep):

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
   lock(&(&zbpg->lock)->rlock);
                                lock(zbud_budlists_spinlock);
                                lock(&(&zbpg->lock)->rlock);
   lock(zbud_budlists_spinlock);

Fix by grabbing the locks in opposite order in zbud_free_and_delist().
