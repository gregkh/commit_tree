net: fix a potential rcu_read_lock() imbalance in rt6_fill_node()

Commit f2c31e32b378 (net: fix NULL dereferences in check_peer_redir() )
added a regression in rt6_fill_node(), leading to rcu_read_lock()
imbalance.

Thats because NLA_PUT() can make a jump to nla_put_failure label.

Fix this by using nla_put()

Many thanks to Ben Greear for his help
