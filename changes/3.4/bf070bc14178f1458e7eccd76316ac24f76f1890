usb: musb: wake the device before ulpi transfers

musb can be suspended at the time some other driver wants to do ulpi
transfers using usb_phy_io_* functions, and that can cause data abort,
as it happened with isp1704_charger:

Add pm_runtime to ulpi functions to rectify this. This also adds io_dev
to usb_phy so that pm_runtime_* functions can be used.
