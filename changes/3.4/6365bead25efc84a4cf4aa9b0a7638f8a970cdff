DMA: sa11x0: add SA-11x0 DMA driver

Add support for the SA-11x0 DMA driver, which replaces the private
API version in arch/arm/mach-sa1100/dma.c.

We model this as a set of virtual DMA channels, one for each request
signal, and assign the virtual DMA channel to a physical DMA channel
when there is work to be done.  This allows DMA users to claim their
channels, and hold them while not in use, without affecting the
availability of the physical channels.

Another advantage over this approach, compared to the private version,
is that a channel can be reconfigured on the fly without having to
release and re-request it - which for the IrDA driver, allows us to
use DMA for SIR mode transmit without eating up three physical
channels.  As IrDA is half-duplex, we actually only need one physical
channel, and this architecture allows us to achieve that.
