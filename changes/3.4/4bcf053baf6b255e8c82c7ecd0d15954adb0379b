e1000e: remove test that is always false

warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false

Remove an unnecessary test that is reported when compiling driver with W=1.
The test is unnecessary because Intel wired GbE hardware older (i.e. less)
than 82571 is not supported by this driver.
