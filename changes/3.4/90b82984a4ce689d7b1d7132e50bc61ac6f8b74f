e1000e: update workaround for 82579 intermittently disabled during S0->Sx

The workaround which toggles the LANPHYPC (LAN PHY Power Control) value bit
to force the MAC-Phy interconnect into PCIe mode from SMBus mode during
driver load and resume should always be done except if PHY resets are
blocked by the Manageability Engine (ME).  Previously, the toggle was done
only if PHY resets are blocked and the ME was disabled.

The rest of the patch is just indentation changes as a consequence of the
updated workaround.
