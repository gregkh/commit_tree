Btrfs: remove lock assert from get_restripe_target()

This fixes a regression introduced by fc67c450.  spin_is_locked() always
returns 0 on UP kernels, which caused assert in get_restripe_target() to
be fired on every call from btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile() on UP systems.
Remove it completely for now, it's not clear if it's going to be needed
in future.
