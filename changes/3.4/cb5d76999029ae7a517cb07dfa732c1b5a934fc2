perf: Add ABI reference sizes

This patch adds reference sizes for revision 1
and 2 of the perf_event ABI, i.e., the size of
the perf_event_attr struct.

With Rev1: config2 was added = +8 bytes
With Rev2: branch_sample_type was added = +8 bytes

Adds the definition for Rev1, Rev2.

This is useful for tools trying to decode the revision
numbers based on the size of the struct.
