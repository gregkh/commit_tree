PM / Sleep: Initialize wakeup source locks in wakeup_source_add()

Initialize wakeup source locks in wakeup_source_add() instead of
wakeup_source_create(), because otherwise the locks of the wakeup
sources that haven't been allocated with wakeup_source_create()
aren't initialized and handled properly.
