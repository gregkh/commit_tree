drivers/rtc/rtc-twl.c: return correct RTC event from ISR

Following changes are made as part of this change:

1. As TWL RTC supports periodic interrupt, the correct event should be
   RTC_PF instead of RTC_UF.

2. No need to initialize variable "events" to 0 & then OR it with the
   event values.  Hence fixing it.
