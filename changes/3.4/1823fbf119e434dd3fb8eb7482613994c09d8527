powerpc/eeh: pseries platform EEH configure bridge

In order to enable particular PCI device, which has been included
in the parent PE. The involved PCI bridges should be enabled explicitly
if there has. On pSeries platform, there're dedicated RTAS calls
to fulfil the purpose.

The patch implements the function of configuring PCI bridges through
the dedicated RTAS calls. Besides, the function has been abstracted
by struct eeh_ops::configure_bridge so that the EEH core components
could support multiple platforms in future.
