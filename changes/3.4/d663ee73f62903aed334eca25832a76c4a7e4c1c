iwlwifi: abstract out missing SEQ_RX_FRAME workaround

Mohammed Shafi ran into [1] the SEQ_RX_FRAME workaround
warning with a statistics notification, this means we
can't just remove it as we'd hoped.

Abstract it out so that the higher layer can configure
this as a kind of "filter" in the transport.
