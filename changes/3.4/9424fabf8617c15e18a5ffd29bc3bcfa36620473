powerpc: Fix 64-bit BookE FP unavailable exceptions

We were using CR0.EQ after EXCEPTION_COMMON, hoping it still
contained whether we came from userspace or kernel space.

However, under some circumstances, EXCEPTION_COMMON will
call C code and clobber non-volatile registers, so we really
need to re-load the previous MSR from the stackframe and
re-test.

While there, invert the condition to make the fast path more
obvious and remove the BUG_OPCODE which was a debugging
leftover and call .ret_from_except as we should.
