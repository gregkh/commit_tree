bnx2x: Track active PFs with bitmap

The recovery register (to which a hardware lock has been added in previous
patch) is used amongst other things to track the active PFs. The old
implementation which used a per path counter is not viable in a virtualized
environment where a pf may increment the counter and then have the kernel
crash around it preventing the counter from ever reaching zero.
In the new implementation the scenario described will result in the PF timing
out against the mcp, which will clear the PF's bit in the bitmask allowing
recovery process to proceed.
