target: Make target_release_cmd_kref release on empty list

This patch changes target_release_cmd_kref() to make TFO->release_cmd()
call when list_empty(&se_cmd->se_cmd_list) is TRUE.  This is required
for TMR_ABORT_TASK operation where the referenced tag descriptor may
have already been pulled of the session command list.
