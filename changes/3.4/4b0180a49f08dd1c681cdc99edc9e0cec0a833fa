Squashfs: add mount time sanity check for block_size and block_log match

Squashfs currently has a sanity check for block_size less than or
equal to the maximum block_size (1 Mbyte).  This catches some
superblock corruption, but obviously with a block_size maximum
of 1 Mbyte there's 7 correct values (4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, ... etc) and
a lot of incorrect values which are not caught by this check.

The Squashfs superblock, however, has both a block_size and
a block_log (2^block_log == block_size).  Checking that the block_size
matches the block_log is a much more robust check.  Corruption of the
superblock is unlikely to produce values which match, and it also
ensures the block_size is an exact power of two.
