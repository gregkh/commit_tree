rtc: Disable the alarm in the hardware (v2)

Currently, the RTC code does not disable the alarm in the hardware.

This means that after a sequence such as the one below (the files are in the
RTC sysfs), the box will boot up after 2 minutes even though we've
asked for the alarm to be turned off.

	# echo $((`cat since_epoch`)+120) > wakealarm
	# echo 0 > wakealarm
	# poweroff

Fix this by disabling the alarm when there are no timers to run.

The original version of this patch was reverted. This version
disables the irq directly instead of setting a disabled timer
in the future.
