mtd: check for zero length in OTP functions

This patch changes all the OTP functions like 'mtd_get_fact_prot_info()' and
makes them return zero immediately if the input 'len' parameter is 0. This is
not really needed currently, but most of the other functions do this, and it is
just consistent to do the same in the OTP functions.

This patch also moves the OTP functions from the header file to mtdcore.c
because they become a bit too big for being inlined.
