pinctrl: factor pin control handles over to the core

This moves the per-devices struct pinctrl handles and device map
over from the pinmux part of the subsystem to the core pinctrl part.
This makes the device handles core infrastructure with the goal of
using these handles also for pin configuration, so that device
drivers (or boards etc) will need one and only one handle to the
pin control core.
