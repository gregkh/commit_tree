PCI: Fix "cardbus bridge resources as optional" size handling

We should not set the requested size to -2; that will confuse the
resource list sorting with align when SIZEALIGN is used.

Change to STARTALIGN and pass align from start;  we are safe to do that
just as we do that regular pci bridge.  In the long run, we should just
treat cardbus like a regular pci bridge.

Also fix the case when realloc_head is not passed: we should keep the
requested size.
