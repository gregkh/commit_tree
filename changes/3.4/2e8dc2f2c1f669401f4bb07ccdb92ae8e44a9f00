usb/usbmon: correct the data interpretation of usbmon's output

The doc says that the data
| 55534243 5e000000 00000000 00000600 00000000 00000000 00000000 000000
is the SCSI command 0x5e. According to the usbmon source, it dumps one
byte after the other. The first 4 bytes are US_BULK_CB_SIGN which is
correct. After that we see the TAG which is 0x5e. The cdb is 0x00 in
this example.
In order to correct this, I change the example to a READ_10 command
which is 0x28 so it is not just a zero somewhere in the stream.
