Revert "wl12xx: Change claiming of the SDIO bus"

This reverts commit 393fb560d328cc06e6a5c7b7473901ad724f82e7.

Commit b6ad726 ("mmc: core: Prevent too long response times
for suspend") fails the suspend if the mmc host can't be
claimed before suspend. As the host is claimed by us as long
as the chip is powered on, suspend will always fail.

Revert to claiming the sdio bus only when needed.
