cpuidle: add a sysfs entry to disable specific C state for debug purpose.

Some C states of new CPU might be not good.  One reason is BIOS might
configure them incorrectly.  To help developers root cause it quickly, the
patch adds a new sysfs entry, so developers could disable specific C state
manually.

In addition, C state might have much impact on performance tuning, as it
takes much time to enter/exit C states, which might delay interrupt
processing.  With the new debug option, developers could check if a deep C
state could impact performance and how much impact it could cause.

Also add this option in Documentation/cpuidle/sysfs.txt.
