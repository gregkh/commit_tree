hwmon: (ad7314) Adds missing spi_dev initialization

This driver was recently moved from IIO (where it worked) to hwmon (where
it doesn't.) This breakage occured because the hwmon version neglected to
correctly initialize a reference to spi_dev in its drvdata. The result is a
segfault every time the temperature is queried.
