ARM: SAMSUNG: support the second capability for samsung-soc

In mmc, there are capabilities and use the host_caps.
That capability is expressed with bit[0:31].
But now..already filled the bit[0:31]...
so we need to denote with the other capability field.
(if we want to use the cache, powerclass, etc for eMMC..
 this field is necessary)
