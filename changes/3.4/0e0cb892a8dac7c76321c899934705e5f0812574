init/do_mounts.c: print error code on mount failure

Printing the error code makes it easier to debug the cause of a mount
failure.  For example I had the problem that the root file system could
not be mounted read-writeable because my SD card was write-protected.
Without an error code it looks like the SD card was not detected at all.
