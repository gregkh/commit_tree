AppArmor: Fix error returned when a path lookup is disconnected

The returning of -ESATLE when a path lookup fails as disconnected is wrong.
Since AppArmor is rejecting the access return -EACCES instead.

This also fixes a bug in complain (learning) mode where disconnected paths
are denied because -ESTALE errors are not ignored causing failures that
can change application behavior.
