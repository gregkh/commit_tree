staging: android: ram_console: split out persistent ram

Split ram_console into two halves.

persistent_ram is a set of apis that handle a block of memory
that does not get erased across a reboot.  It provides functions
to fill it as a single buffer or a ring buffer, and to extract
the old data after a reboot.  It handles ecc on the data to
correct bit errors introduced during reboot.

ram_console is now a small wrapper around persistent_ram that
feeds console data into the ringbuffer, and exports the old
data to /proc/last_kmsg after a reboot.
