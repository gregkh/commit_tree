SUNRPC: split SUNPRC PipeFS pipe data and inode creation

Generally, pipe data is used only for pipes, and thus allocating space for it
on every RPC inode allocation is redundant. This patch splits private SUNRPC
PipeFS pipe data and inode, makes pipe data allocated only for pipe inodes.
This patch is also is a next step towards to to removing PipeFS inode
references from kernel code other than PipeFS itself.
