ASoC: mxs-pcm: Request DMA channel early

Request the DMA channel in the PCM open callback instead of the hwparams
callback, this allows us to let open fail if no dma channel is available. This
also fixes a bug where the channel will be requested multiple times if hwparams
is called multiple times.
