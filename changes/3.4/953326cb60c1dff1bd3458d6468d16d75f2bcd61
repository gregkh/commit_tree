drivers/staging/telephony/ixj.c: fix warning about sequence points

In the statement

	j->caplist[j->caps].handle = j->caps++;

there is no sequence point between the usage of j->caps on the LHS of
the assignment and the incrementation on its RHS.  So it's not defined
in Standard C if j->caps is already incremented when used on the LHS
even though the postfix ++ operator is used.  To properly fix that the
incrementation has to be done in a separate expression.

This fixes:
