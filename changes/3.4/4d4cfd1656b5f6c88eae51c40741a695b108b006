regmap: Allow drivers to sync only part of the register cache

Provide a regcache_sync_region() operation which allows drivers to
write only part of the cache back to the hardware. This is intended
for use in cases like power domains or DSP memories where part of the
device register map may be reset without fully resetting the device.

Fully supporting these devices is likely to require additional work to
make specific regions of the register map cache only while they are in
reset, but this is enough for most devices.
