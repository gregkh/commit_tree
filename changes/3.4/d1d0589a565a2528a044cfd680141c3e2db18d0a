arch/x86/platform/geode/net5501.c: change active_low to 0 for LED driver

It seems that there was an error with the active_low = 1 for the
LED, since it should be set to 0 (meaning that active is high,
since 0 is false, hence the confusion.

The wiki article about it confuses it, since it contradicts itself,
regarding what turns on the LED.

I have tested 3.4-rc2 on my net5501 with this patch, and it makes the LED
behave correctly, where "none" turns it off, and "default-on" turns it on,
when echoed onto the trigger "file" in /sys/class/leds.
