tty: serial: OMAP: Fix oops due to NULL pdata in DT boot

The following commit: be4b0281956c5cae4f63f31f11d07625a6988766
(tty: serial: OMAP: block idle while the UART is transferring data in PIO mode),
is introducing an oops if OMAP is booted using device tree blob because
the pdata will not be initialized.

Check if pdata is set before de-referencing it.
