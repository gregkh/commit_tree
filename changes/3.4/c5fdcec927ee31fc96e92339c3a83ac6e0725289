lockdep: Add CPU-idle/offline warning to lockdep-RCU splat

It is illegal to use RCU from a CPU that has reported idleness or
offlinedness to RCU.  However, it can be quite difficult to determine
from a stack trace whether or not a given CPU is idle or offline.
Therefore, this commit adds idle/offline diagnostics to the lockdep-RCU
error message.
