rcu: Add diagnostic for misaligned rcu_head structures

The push for energy efficiency will require that RCU tag rcu_head
structures to indicate whether or not their invocation is time critical.
This tagging is best carried out in the bottom bits of the ->next
pointers in the rcu_head structures.  This tagging requires that the
rcu_head structures be properly aligned, so this commit adds the required
diagnostics.
