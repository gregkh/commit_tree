ftrace, perf: Add open/close tracepoint perf registration actions

Adding TRACE_REG_PERF_OPEN and TRACE_REG_PERF_CLOSE to differentiate
register/unregister from open/close actions.

The register/unregister actions are invoked for the first/last
tracepoint user when opening/closing the event.

The open/close actions are invoked for each tracepoint user when
opening/closing the event.
