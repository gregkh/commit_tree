TTY: remove re-assignments to tty_driver members

All num, magic and owner are set by alloc_tty_driver. No need to
re-set them on each allocation site.

pti driver sets something different to what it passes to
alloc_tty_driver. It is not a bug, since we don't use the lines
parameter in any way. Anyway this is fixed, and now we do the right
thing.
