tipc: Remove obsolete comments about routing table updates

Eliminates a block of comments that describe how routing table updates
are to be handled. These comments no longer apply following the removal
of TIPC's prototype multi-cluster support.

Note that these changes are essentially cosmetic in nature, and have
no impact on the actual operation of TIPC.
