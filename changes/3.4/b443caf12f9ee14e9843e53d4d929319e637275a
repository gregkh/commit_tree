ARM: mach-msm: fix compile fail from system.h fallout

To fix:

  In file included from arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:28:0:
  arm/mach-msm/include/mach/uncompress.h: In function 'putc':
  arch/arm/mach-msm/include/mach/uncompress.h:48:3: error: implicit
  declaration of function 'smp_mb' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

The putc does a cpu_relax which for this platform is smp_mb.
