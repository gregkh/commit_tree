staging: tidspbridge: Rename module from bridgedriver to tidspbridge

tidspbridge when built as a module is named bridgedriver.

bridgedriver is not a particularly good module name.

tidspbridge is what the source is named.  That seems
a more appropriate module name too as it describes
the hardware function better.
