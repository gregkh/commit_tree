be2net: event queue re-design

v2: Fixed up the bad typecasting pointed out by David...

In the current design 8 TXQs are serviced by 1 EQ, while each RSS queue
is serviced by a separate EQ. This is being changed as follows:

- Upto 8 EQs will be used (based on the availabilty of msix vectors).
Each EQ will handle 1 RSS and 1 TX ring. The default non-RSS RX queue and
MCC queue are handled by the last EQ.

- On cards which provide support, upto 8 RSS rings will be used, instead
of the current limit of 4.

The new design allows spreading the TX multi-queue completion processing
across multiple CPUs unlike the previous design.
