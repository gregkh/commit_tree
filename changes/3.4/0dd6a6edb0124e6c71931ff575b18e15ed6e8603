KVM: Dont mark TSC unstable due to S4 suspend

During a host suspend, TSC may go backwards, which KVM interprets
as an unstable TSC.  Technically, KVM should not be marking the
TSC unstable, which causes the TSC clocksource to go bad, but we
need to be adjusting the TSC offsets in such a case.

Dealing with this issue is a little tricky as the only place we
can reliably do it is before much of the timekeeping infrastructure
is up and running.  On top of this, we are not in a KVM thread
context, so we may not be able to safely access VCPU fields.
Instead, we compute our best known hardware offset at power-up and
stash it to be applied to all VCPUs when they actually start running.
