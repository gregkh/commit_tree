[media] cx22702: Fix signal strength

The signal strength value returned is not quite correct, it decreases
when I increase the gain of my antenna, and vice versa. It also
doesn't span over the whole 0x0000-0xffff range. Compute a value which
at least increases when signal strength increases, and spans the whole
allowed range.

In practice I get 67% with my antenna fully amplified and 51% with
no amplification. This is close enough to what I get on my other
DVB-T adapter with the same antenna.
