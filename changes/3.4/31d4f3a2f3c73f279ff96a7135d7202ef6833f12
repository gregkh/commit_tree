ext4: check for zero length extent

Explicitly test for an extent whose length is zero, and flag that as a
corrupted extent.

This avoids a kernel BUG_ON assertion failure.

Tested: Without this patch, the file system image found in
tests/f_ext_zero_len/image.gz in the latest e2fsprogs sources causes a
kernel panic.  With this patch, an ext4 file system error is noted
instead, and the file system is marked as being corrupted.
