rcu: No interrupt disabling for rcu_prepare_for_idle()

The rcu_prepare_for_idle() function is always called with interrupts
disabled, so there is no reason to disable interrupts again within
rcu_prepare_for_idle().  Therefore, this commit removes all of the
interrupt disabling, also removing a latent disabling-unbalance bug.
