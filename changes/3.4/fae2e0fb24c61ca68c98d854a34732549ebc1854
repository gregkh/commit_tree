powerpc: Fix typo in runlatch code

Commit fe1952fc0afb9a2e4c79f103c08aef5d13db1873
"powerpc: Rework runlatch code" has a nasty typo
where it uses "TLF_RUNLATCH" instead of "_TLF_RUNLATCH"
(bit number instead of bit mask), causing some flags to
be potentially lost such as _TLF_RESTORE_SIGMASK

(Brown paper bag for me ! We should be able to make
that break at compile time with a bit of magic, any
volunteer ?)
