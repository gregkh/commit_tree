[IA64] hpsim, fix SAL handling in fw-emu

The switch-cases of SAL_FREQ_BASE generate non-relocatable code. The
same as for the ifs one level upper. This causes oopses early in boot
because the kernel jumps to the hell instead of the offset in sal
callback.

So use ifs here for SAL_FREQ_BASE decision too.

Isn't there any compiler directive or settings to solve that cleanly?
