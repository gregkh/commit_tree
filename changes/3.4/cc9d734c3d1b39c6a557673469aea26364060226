rbd: use a single value of snap_name to mean no snap

There's already a constant for this anyway.

Since rbd_header_set_snap() is only used to set the rbd device
snap_name field, just do that within that function rather than
having it take the snap_name as an argument.

v2: Changed interface rbd_header_set_snap() so it explicitly updates
    the snap_name in the rbd_device.  Also added a BUILD_BUG_ON()
    to verify the size of the snap_name field is sufficient for
    SNAP_HEAD_NAME.
