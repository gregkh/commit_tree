ARM: 7382/1: mm: truncate memory banks to fit in 4GB space for classic MMU

If a bank of memory spanning the 4GB boundary is added on a !CONFIG_LPAE
kernel then we will hang early during boot since the memory bank will
have wrapped around to zero.

This patch truncates memory banks for !LPAE configurations when the end
address is not representable in 32 bits.
