vfs: remove unused superblock helpers

Remove the 'sb_mark_dirty()', 'sb_mark_clean()' and 'sb_is_dirty()'
helpers which are not used. I introduced them 2 years and the
intention was to make all file-systems use them in order to be able to
optimize 'sync_supers()'.  However, Al Viro vetoed my patches at the
end and asked me to push superblock management down to file-systems
and get rid of the 's_dirt' flag completely, as well as kill
'sync_supers()' altogether. Thus, remove the helpers.
