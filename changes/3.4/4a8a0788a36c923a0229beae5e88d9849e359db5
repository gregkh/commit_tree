parisc: move definition of PAGE0 to asm/page.h

This was defined in asm/pdc.h which needs to include asm/page.h for
__PAGE_OFFSET. This leads to an include loop so that page.h eventually will
include pdc.h again. While this is no problem because of header guards, it is
a problem because some symbols may be undefined. Such an error is this:
