tipc: Prevent broadcast link stalling in dual LAN environments

Ensure that sequence number information about incoming broadcast link
messages is initialized only by the activation of the first link to a
given cluster node.  Previously, a race condition allowed reset and/or
activation messages for a second link to re-initialize this sequence
number information with obsolete values. This could trigger TIPC to
request the retransmission of previously acknowledged broadcast link
messages from that node, resulting in broadcast link processing becoming
stalled if the node had already released one or more of those messages
and was unable to perform the required retransmission.

and assisting in the development of this fix.
