x86, boot: Restrict CFLAGS for hostprogs

Currently tools/build has access to all the kernel headers in
$(srctree). This is unnecessary and could potentially allow
tools/build to erroneously include kernel headers when it should only
be including userspace-exported headers.

Unfortunately, mkcpustr still needs access to some of the asm kernel
headers, so explicitly special case that hostprog.
