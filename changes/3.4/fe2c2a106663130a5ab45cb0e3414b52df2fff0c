vmscan: reclaim at order 0 when compaction is enabled

When built with CONFIG_COMPACTION, kswapd should not try to free
contiguous pages, because it is not trying hard enough to have a real
chance at being successful, but still disrupts the LRU enough to break
other things.

Do not do higher order page isolation unless we really are in lumpy
reclaim mode.

Stop reclaiming pages once we have enough free pages that compaction can
deal with things, and we hit the normal order 0 watermarks used by kswapd.

Also remove a line of code that increments balanced right before exiting
the function.
