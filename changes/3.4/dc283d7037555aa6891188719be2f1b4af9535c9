ARM: 7351/1: ftrace: remove useless memory checks

Before replacing an instruction, the ftrace code determines what the old
instruction should be and verifies that that's what's really there in
memory before replacing it.  This is useful if for example a bug in
mcountrecord causes it to record wrong locations.

However, in cases where we replace call sites in entry-common.S, these
checks are not needed.  For these, we currently just memcpy() the memory
content and then "verify" it -- this is quite useless and can be
removed.
