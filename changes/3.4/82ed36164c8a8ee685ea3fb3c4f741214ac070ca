KVM: PPC: Book3s HV: Implement get_dirty_log using hardware changed bit

This changes the implementation of kvm_vm_ioctl_get_dirty_log() for
Book3s HV guests to use the hardware C (changed) bits in the guest
hashed page table.  Since this makes the implementation quite different
from the Book3s PR case, this moves the existing implementation from
book3s.c to book3s_pr.c and creates a new implementation in book3s_hv.c.
That implementation calls kvmppc_hv_get_dirty_log() to do the actual
work by calling kvm_test_clear_dirty on each page.  It iterates over
the HPTEs, clearing the C bit if set, and returns 1 if any C bit was
set (including the saved C bit in the rmap entry).
