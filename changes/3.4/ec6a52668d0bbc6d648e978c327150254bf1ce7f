sysctl: Add ctl_table chains into cstring paths

For any component of table passed to __register_sysctl_paths
that actually serves as a path, add that to the cstring path
that is passed to __register_sysctl_table.

The result is that for most calls to __register_sysctl_paths
we only pass a table to __register_sysctl_table that contains
no child directories.
