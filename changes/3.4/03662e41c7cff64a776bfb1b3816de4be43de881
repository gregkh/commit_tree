atl1: fix kernel panic in case of DMA errors

Problem:
There was two separate work_struct structures which share one
handler. Unfortunately getting atl1_adapter structure from
work_struct in case of DMA error was done from incorrect
offset which cause kernel panics.

Solution:
The useless work_struct for DMA error removed and
handler name changed to more generic one.
