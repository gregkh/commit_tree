ARM: davinci: create new common platform header for davinci

Remove individual platform header files for dm365, dm355, dm644x
and dm646x and consolidate it into a single and common
header file davinci.h placed in arch/arm/mach-davinci.

This reduces the pollution in the include/mach and is consistent
with Russell's suggestions as part of his "pet peaves" mail.
(See #4 in: http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2011-November/071516.html)

While at it, fix the forward declaration of spi_board_info,
and include the right header file instead.

The further patches in the series take  advantage of this consolidation
for easy implementation of IO_ADDRESS elimination.
