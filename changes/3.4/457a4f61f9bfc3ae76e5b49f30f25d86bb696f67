xHCI: add XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME quirk for VIA xHCI host

The suspend operation of VIA xHCI host have some issues and
hibernate operation works fine, so The XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME
quirk is added for it.

This patch should base on "xHCI: Don't write zeroed pointer
to xHC registers" that is released by Sarah. Otherwise, the
host system error will ocurr in the hibernate operation
process.

This should be backported to stable kernels as old as 2.6.37,
that contain the commit c877b3b2ad5cb9d4fe523c5496185cc328ff3ae9
"xhci: Add reset on resume quirk for asrock p67 host".
