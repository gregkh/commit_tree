perf stat: Fix event grouping on forked task

When event group is enabled for forked task (i.e. no target task was
specified) all events were disabled and marked ->enable_on_exec.
However they are not counted at all since only group leader will be
enabled on exec actually. So the result looked like below:

 $ ./perf stat --group -- sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'sleep 1':

          0.554926 task-clock                #    0.001 CPUs utilized
     <not counted> context-switches
     <not counted> CPU-migrations
     <not counted> page-faults
     <not counted> cycles
   <not supported> stalled-cycles-frontend
   <not supported> stalled-cycles-backend
     <not counted> instructions
     <not counted> branches
     <not counted> branch-misses

       1.001228093 seconds time elapsed

Fix it by disabling group leader only.
