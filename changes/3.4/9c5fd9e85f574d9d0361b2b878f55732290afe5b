ARM: 7379/1: DT: fix atags_to_fdt() second call site

atags_to_fdt() returns 1 when it fails to find a valid FDT signature.
The CONFIG_ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT code is supposed to retry with another
location, but only does so when the initial call doesn't fail.

Fix this by using the correct condition in the assembly code.
