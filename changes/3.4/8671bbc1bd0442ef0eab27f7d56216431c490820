PM / Sleep: Add more wakeup source initialization routines

The existing wakeup source initialization routines are not
particularly useful for wakeup sources that aren't created by
wakeup_source_create(), because their users have to open code
filling the objects with zeros and setting their names.  For this
reason, introduce routines that can be used for initializing, for
example, static wakeup source objects.
