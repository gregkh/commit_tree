mac80211: remove dummy STA support

The dummy STA support was added because I didn't
want to change the driver API at the time. Now
that we have state transitions triggering station
add/remove in the driver, we only call add once a
station reaches ASSOCIATED, so we can remove the
dummy station stuff again.

While at it, tighten the RX check and accept only
port control (EAP) frames from the AP station if
it's not associated yet -- in other cases there's
no race.
