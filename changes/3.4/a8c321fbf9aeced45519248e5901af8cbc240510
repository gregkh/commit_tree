x86/mce: Handle "action required" errors

All non-urgent actions (reporting low severity errors and handling
"action-optional" errors) are now handled by a work queue. This
means that TIF_MCE_NOTIFY can be used to block execution for a
thread experiencing an "action-required" fault until we get all
cpus out of the machine check handler (and the thread that hit
the fault into mce_notify_process().

We use the new mce_{save,find,clear}_info() API to get information
from do_machine_check() to mce_notify_process(), and then use the
newly improved memory_failure(..., MF_ACTION_REQUIRED) to handle
the error (possibly signalling the process).

Update some comments to make the new code flows clearer.
