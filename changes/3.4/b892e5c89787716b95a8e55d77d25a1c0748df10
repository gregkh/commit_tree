tracing: Keep NMI watchdog from triggering when dumping trace

As ftrace_dump() (called by ftrace_dump_on_oops) disables interrupts
as it dumps its output to the console, it can keep interrupts disabled
for long periods of time. This is likely to trigger the NMI watchdog,
and it can disrupt the output of critical data.

Add a touch_nmi_watchdog() to each event that is written to the screen
to keep the NMI watchdog from affecting the output.
