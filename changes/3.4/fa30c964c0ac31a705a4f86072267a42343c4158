perf tools: Fix bug in raw sample parsing

In perf_event__parse_sample(), the array variable was not incremented
by the amount of data used by the raw_data.

That was okay until we added PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK which depends on
the array variable pointing to the beginning of the branch stack data.

But that was not the case if branch stack was combined with raw mode
sampling. That led to bogus branch stack addresses and count.

The bug would show up with:
$ perf record -R -b foo

This patch fixes the problem by correctly moving the array pointer
forward for RAW samples.
