ext4: fix handling of journalled quota options

Commit 26092bf5 broke handling of journalled quota mount options by
trying to parse argument of every mount option as a number.  Fix this
by dealing with the quota options before we call match_int().

Thanks to Jan Kara for discovering this regression.
