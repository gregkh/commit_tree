perf record: Add support for sampling taken branch

This patch adds a new option to enable taken branch stack
sampling, i.e., leverage the PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK feature
of perf_events.

There is a new option to active this mode: -b.
It is possible to pass a set of filters to select the type of
branches to sample.

The following filters are available:

 - any : any type of branches
 - any_call : any function call or system call
 - any_ret : any function return or system call return
 - any_ind : any indirect branch
 - u:  only when the branch target is at the user level
 - k: only when the branch target is in the kernel
 - hv: only when the branch target is in the hypervisor

Filters can be combined by passing a comma separated list
to the option:

$ perf record -b any_call,u -e cycles:u branchy
