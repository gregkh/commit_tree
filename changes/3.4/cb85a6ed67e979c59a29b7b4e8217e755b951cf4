proc: stats: Use arch_idle_time for idle and iowait times if available

Git commit a25cac5198d4ff28 "proc: Consider NO_HZ when printing idle and
iowait times" changes the code for /proc/stat to use get_cpu_idle_time_us
and get_cpu_iowait_time_us if the system is running with nohz enabled.
For architectures which define arch_idle_time (currently s390 only)
this is a change for the worse. The result of arch_idle_time is supposed
to be the exact sleep time of the target cpu and should be used instead
of the value kept by the scheduler.
