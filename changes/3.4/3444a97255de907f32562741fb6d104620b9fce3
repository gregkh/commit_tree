btrfs: Factor out tree->ops->merge_bio_hook call

In submit_extent_page, there's a visually noisy if statement that, in
the midst of other conditions, does the tree dependency for tree->ops
and tree->ops->merge_bio_hook before calling it, and then another
condition afterwards. If an error is returned from merge_bio_hook,
there's no way to catch it. It's considered a routine "1" return
value instead of a failure.

This patch factors out the dependency check into a new local merge_bio
routine and BUG's on an error. The if statement is less noisy as a side-
effect.
