NFS: null dereference in dev_remove()

In commit 5ffaf85541 "NFS: replace global bl_wq with per-net one" we
made "msg" a pointer instead of a struct stored in stack memory.  But we
forgot to change the memset() here so we're still clearing stack memory
instead clearing the struct like we intended.  It will lead to a kernel
crash.
