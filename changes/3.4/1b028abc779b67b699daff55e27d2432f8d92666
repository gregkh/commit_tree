sched/rt: Improve pick_next_highest_task_rt()

Avoid extra work by continuing on to the next rt_rq if the highest
prio task in current rt_rq is the same priority as our candidate
task.

More detailed explanation:  if next is not NULL, then we have found a
candidate task, and its priority is next->prio.  Now we are looking
for an even higher priority task in the other rt_rq's.  idx is the
highest priority in the current candidate rt_rq.  In the current 3.3
code, if idx is equal to next->prio, we would start scanning the tasks
in that rt_rq and replace the current candidate task with a task from
that rt_rq.  But the new task would only have a priority that is equal
to our previous candidate task, so we have not advanced our goal of
finding a higher prio task.  So we should avoid the extra work by
continuing on to the next rt_rq if idx is equal to next->prio.
