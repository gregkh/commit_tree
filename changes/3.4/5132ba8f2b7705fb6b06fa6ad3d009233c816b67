xfs: don't cache inodes read through bulkstat

When we read inodes via bulkstat, we generally only read them once
and then throw them away - they never get used again. If we retain
them in cache, then it simply causes the working set of inodes and
other cached items to be reclaimed just so the inode cache can grow.

Avoid this problem by marking inodes read by bulkstat not to be
cached and check this flag in .drop_inode to determine whether the
inode should be added to the VFS LRU or not. If the inode lookup
hits an already cached inode, then don't set the flag. If the inode
lookup hits an inode marked with no cache flag, remove the flag and
allow it to be cached once the current reference goes away.

Inodes marked as not cached will get cleaned up by the background
inode reclaim or via memory pressure, so they will still generate
some short term cache pressure. They will, however, be reclaimed
much sooner and in preference to cache hot inodes.
