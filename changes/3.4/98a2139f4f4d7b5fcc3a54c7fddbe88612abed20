nfs: Enclose hostname in brackets when needed in nfs_do_root_mount

When hostname contains colon (e.g. when it is an IPv6 address) it needs
to be enclosed in brackets to make parsing of NFS device string possible.
Fix nfs_do_root_mount() to enclose hostname properly when needed. NFS code
actually does not need this as it does not parse the string passed by
nfs_do_root_mount() but the device string is exposed to userspace in
/proc/mounts.
