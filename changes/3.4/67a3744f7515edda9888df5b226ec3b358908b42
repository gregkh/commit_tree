drm/i915: check gtfifodbg after possibly failed writes

If we don't have a sufficient number of free entries in the FIFO, we
proceed to do a write anyway. With this check we should have a clue if
that write actually failed or not.

After some discussion with Daniel Vetter regarding his original
complaint, we agreed upon this.
