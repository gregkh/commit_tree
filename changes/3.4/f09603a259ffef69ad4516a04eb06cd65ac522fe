mac80211: add sta_state callback

(based on Eliad's patch)

Add a callback to notify the low-level driver whenever
the state of a station changes. The driver is only
notified when the station is actually in the mac80211
hash table, not for pre-insert state transitions.

To allow the driver to replace sta_add/remove calls
with this, call extra transitions with the NOTEXIST
state.

This callback can fail, so we need to be careful in
handling it when a station is inserted, particularly
in the IBSS case where we still keep the station entry
around for mac80211 purposes.
