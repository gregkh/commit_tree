drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_cs.c: eliminate possible double free

The function radeon_cs_parser_init is only called from two places, in
drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_cs.c and drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r600_cs.c.
In each case, if the call fails another function is called that frees all
of the kdata and dpage information in the chunks array.  So this
information should not be freed in radeon_cs_parser_init as well.
