udlfb: remove sysfs framebuffer device with USB .disconnect()

The USB graphics card driver delays the unregistering of the framebuffer
device to a workqueue, which breaks the userspace visible remove uevent
sequence. Recent userspace tools started to support USB graphics card
hotplug out-of-the-box and rely on proper events sent by the kernel.

The framebuffer device is a direct child of the USB interface which is
removed immediately after the USB .disconnect() callback. But the fb device
in /sys stays around until its final cleanup, at a time where all the parent
devices have been removed already.

To work around that, we remove the sysfs fb device directly in the USB
.disconnect() callback and leave only the cleanup of the internal fb
data to the delayed work.

Before:
 add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2 (usb)
 add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/2-1.2:1.0 (usb)
 add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/2-1.2:1.0/graphics/fb0 (graphics)
 remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/2-1.2:1.0 (usb)
 remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2 (usb)
 remove   /2-1.2:1.0/graphics/fb0 (graphics)

After:
 add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2 (usb)
 add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/2-1.2:1.0 (usb)
 add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/2-1.2:1.0/graphics/fb1 (graphics)
 remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/2-1.2:1.0/graphics/fb1 (graphics)
 remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/2-1.2:1.0 (usb)
 remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2 (usb)
