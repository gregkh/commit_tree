w1_bq27000: remove unnecessary NULL test.

As recent change means that we now dereference 'dev' before testing
for NULL.

That means either the change was wrong, or the test isn't needed.
As this function is only called from one driver (bq27x000_battery) and
it always passed a non-NULL dev, it seems good to assume that the
test isn't needed.

So remove it.
