mm, counters: remove task argument to sync_mm_rss() and __sync_task_rss_stat()

sync_mm_rss() can only be used for current to avoid race conditions in
iterating and clearing its per-task counters.  Remove the task argument
for it and its helper function, __sync_task_rss_stat(), to avoid thinking
it can be used safely for anything other than current.
