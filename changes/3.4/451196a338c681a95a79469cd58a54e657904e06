staging: tidspbridge: remove CONFIG_TIDSPBRIDGE_DEBUG

Since all the asserts and DBC macros are gone, the kconfig macro
CONFIG_TIDSPBRIDGE_DEBUG is not almost used, but for printing trace messages.

Since it is almost not used, I don't see any case for keep it churning the
configuration menu.

This patch removes completely the kconfig macro CONFIG_TIDSPBRIDGE_DEBUG,
using only TIDSPBRIDGE_BACKTRACE for enabling the debug trace messages.
