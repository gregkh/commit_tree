libceph: move prepare_write_banner()

One of the arguments to prepare_write_connect() indicates whether it
is being called immediately after a call to prepare_write_banner().
Move the prepare_write_banner() call inside prepare_write_connect(),
and reinterpret (and rename) the "after_banner" argument so it
indicates that prepare_write_connect() should *make* the call
rather than should know it has already been made.

This was split out from the next patch to highlight this change in
logic.
