md/raid10 - support resizing some RAID10 arrays.

'resizing' an array in this context means making use of extra
space that has become available in component devices, not adding new
devices.
It also includes shrinking the array to take up less space of
component devices.

This is not supported for array with a 'far' layout.  However
for 'near' and 'offset' layout arrays, adding and removing space at
the end of the devices is easy to support, and this patch provides
that support.
