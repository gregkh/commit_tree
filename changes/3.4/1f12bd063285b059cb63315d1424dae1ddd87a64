Btrfs: fix the mismatch of page->mapping

commit 600a45e1d5e376f679ff9ecc4ce9452710a6d27c
(Btrfs: fix deadlock on page lock when doing auto-defragment)
fixes the deadlock on page, but it also introduces another bug.

A page may have been truncated after unlock & lock.
So we need to find it again to get the right one.

And since we've held i_mutex lock, inode size remains unchanged and
we can drop isize overflow checks.
