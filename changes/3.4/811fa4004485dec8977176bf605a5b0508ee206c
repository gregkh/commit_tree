firmware_class: Split _request_firmware() into three functions, v2

Split _request_firmware() into three functions,
_request_firmware_prepare() doing preparatory work that need not be
done under umhelper_sem, _request_firmware_cleanup() doing the
post-error cleanup and _request_firmware() carrying out the remaining
operations.

This change is requisite for moving the acquisition of umhelper_sem
from _request_firmware() to the callers, which is going to be done
subsequently.
