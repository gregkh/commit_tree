ALSA: hda - Enable sync_write and reset for Conexant codecs

This is an attempt to fix S3-resume problems reported for a few
laptops with different Conexant codecs.  They show the communication
stalls at some time in S3, and the driver falls back into the
single-cmd mode.  This leads to the silent output or the lack of
auto-mute feature.

As a workaround, here enables the sync_write and the bus-reset flags
to make the communication more stable.
