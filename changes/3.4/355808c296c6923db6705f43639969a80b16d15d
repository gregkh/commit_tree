btrfs: ->submit_bio_hook error push-up

This pushes failures from the submit_bio_hook callbacks,
btrfs_submit_bio_hook and btree_submit_bio_hook into the callers, including
callers of submit_one_bio where it catches the failures with BUG_ON.

It also pushes up through the ->readpage_io_failed_hook to
end_bio_extent_writepage where the error is already caught with BUG_ON.
