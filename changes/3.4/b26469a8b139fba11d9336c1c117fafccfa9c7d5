serial: samsung: fix s3c2442 platform data

Without that fix machines having a s3c2442 CPU have something
  like that in dmesg:
    samsung-uart s3c2440-uart.0: could not find driver data
    samsung-uart s3c2440-uart.1: could not find driver data
    samsung-uart s3c2440-uart.2: could not find driver data
  And serial is never initialized.

The previous log was obtained trough early printk on the gta02
  machine.
