checkpatch: high precedence operators do not require additional parentheses in #defines

With any very high precedence operator it is not necessary to enforce
additional parentheses around simple negated expressions.  This prevents
us requesting further perentheses around the following:

    #define PMEM_IS_FREE(id, index) !(pmem[id].bitmap[index].allocated)

For now add logical and bitwise not and unary minus.
