drm/i915: properly compute dp dithering for user-created modes

We've only computed whether we need to fall back to 6bpc due to dp
link bandwidth constrains in mode_valid, but not mode_fixup. Under
various circumstances X likes to create new modes which then lack
proper 6bpc flags (if required), resulting in mode_fixup failures and
ultimately black screens.

Chris Wilson pointed out that we still get things wrong for bpp > 24,
but that should be fixed in another patch (and it'll be easier because
this patch consolidates the logic).

The likely culprit for this regression is

    drm/i915: Force explicit bpp selection for intel_dp_link_required

v2: Fix indentation and tune down the too bold claim that this should
fix the world. Both noticed by Chris Wilson.

v3: Try to really git add things.
