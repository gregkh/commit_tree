net: export netdev_stats_to_stats64

Some drivers use internal netdev stats member to store part of their
stats, yet advertize ndo_get_stats64() to implement some 64bit fields.

Allow them to use netdev_stats_to_stats64() helper to make the copy of
netdev stats before they compute their 64bit counters.
