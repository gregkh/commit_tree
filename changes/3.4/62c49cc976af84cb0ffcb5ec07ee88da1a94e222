KVM: Do not take reference to mm during async #PF

It turned to be totally unneeded. The reason the code was introduced is
so that KVM can prefault swapped in page, but prefault can fail even
if mm is pinned since page table can change anyway. KVM handles this
situation correctly though and does not inject spurious page faults.

Fixes:
 "INFO: SOFTIRQ-safe -> SOFTIRQ-unsafe lock order detected" warning while
 running LTP inside a KVM guest using the recent -next kernel.
