rcu: Stop spurious warnings from synchronize_sched_expedited

synchronize_sched_expedited() is spamming CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
users with an unintended warning from the cpu_is_offline() check: use
raw_smp_processor_id() instead of smp_processor_id() there.

Because the warning is under a get_online_cpus(), it is not possible
for any CPUs to go offline, though it is quite possible that the
task might migrate between the raw_smp_processor_id() and the check
of cpu_is_offline().  This is not a problem because the task cannot
migrate from an offline CPU to an online one or vice versa.  The point
of the check is to verify that synchronize_sched_expedited() is not
called from an offline CPU, for example, from a CPU_DYING notifier, or,
more important, from an outgoing CPU making its way from its CPU_DYING
notifiers to the idle loop.
