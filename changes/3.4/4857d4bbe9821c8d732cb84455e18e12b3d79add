[S390] kernel: Add OS info memory interface

In order to allow kdump based stand-alone dump, some information
has to be passed from the old kernel to the new dump kernel. This
is done via a the struct "os_info" that contains the following fields:
 * crashkernel base and size
 * reipl block
 * vmcoreinfo
 * init function
A pointer to os_info is stored at a well known storage location
and the whole structure as well as all fields are secured with
checksums.
