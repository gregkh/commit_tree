NFS: Properly handle the case where the delegation is revoked

If we know that the delegation stateid is bad or revoked, we need to
remove that delegation as soon as possible, and then mark all the
stateids that relied on that delegation for recovery. We cannot use
the delegation as part of the recovery process.

Also note that NFSv4.1 uses a different error code (NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED)
to indicate that the delegation was revoked.

Finally, ensure that setlk() and setattr() can both recover safely from
a revoked delegation.
