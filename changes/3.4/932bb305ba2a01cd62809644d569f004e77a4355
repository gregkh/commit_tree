jbd2: remove bh_state lock from checkpointing code

All accesses to checkpointing entries in journal_head are protected
by j_list_lock. Thus __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint() doesn't really
need bh_state lock.

Also the only part of journal head that the rest of checkpointing code
needs to check is jh->b_transaction which is safe to read under
j_list_lock.

So we can safely remove bh_state lock from all of checkpointing code which
makes it considerably prettier.
