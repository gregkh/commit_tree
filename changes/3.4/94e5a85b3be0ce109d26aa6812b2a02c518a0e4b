ARM: earlier initialization of vectors page

Initialize the contents of the vectors page immediately after we
allocate the page, but before we map it.  This avoids any possible
aliases with other mappings which may need to be flushed after the
page has been mapped irrespective of the cache type.

We follow this later with a flush_cache_all() after all static memory
mappings have been initialized, which ensures that this is safe from
any cache effects.
