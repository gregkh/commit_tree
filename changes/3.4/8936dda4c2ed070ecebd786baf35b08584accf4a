KVM: PPC: Keep a record of HV guest view of hashed page table entries

This adds an array that parallels the guest hashed page table (HPT),
that is, it has one entry per HPTE, used to store the guest's view
of the second doubleword of the corresponding HPTE.  The first
doubleword in the HPTE is the same as the guest's idea of it, so we
don't need to store a copy, but the second doubleword in the HPTE has
the real page number rather than the guest's logical page number.
This allows us to remove the back_translate() and reverse_xlate()
functions.

This "reverse mapping" array is vmalloc'd, meaning that to access it
in real mode we have to walk the kernel's page tables explicitly.
That is done by the new real_vmalloc_addr() function.  (In fact this
returns an address in the linear mapping, so the result is usable
both in real mode and in virtual mode.)

There are also some minor cleanups here: moving the definitions of
HPT_ORDER etc. to a header file and defining HPT_NPTE for HPT_NPTEG << 3.
