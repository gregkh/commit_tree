[SCSI] virtio_scsi: fix TMF use-after-free

Fix a use-after-free in the TMF path, where cmd may have been already
freed by virtscsi_complete_free when wait_for_completion restarts
executing virtscsi_tmf.  Technically a race, but in practice the command
will always be freed long before the completion waiter is awoken.

The fix is to make callers specifying a completion responsible for
freeing the command in all cases.
