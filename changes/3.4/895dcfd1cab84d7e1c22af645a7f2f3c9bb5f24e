ipmi: fix message handling during panics

The part of the IPMI driver that delivered panic information to the event
log and extended the watchdog timeout during a panic was not properly
handling the messages.  It used static messages to avoid allocation, but
wasn't properly waiting for these, or wasn't properly handling the
refcounts.
