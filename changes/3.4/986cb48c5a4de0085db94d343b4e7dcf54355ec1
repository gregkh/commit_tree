x86-32/irq: Don't switch to irq stack for a user-mode irq

If the irq happens in user mode, our kernel stack is empty
(apart from the pt_regs themselves, of course), so there's no
need or advantage to switch.

And it really doesn't save any stack space, quite the reverse:
it means that a nested interrupt cannot switch irq stacks. So
instead of saving kernel stack space, it actually causes the
potential for *more* stack usage.

Also simplify the preemption count copy when we do switch
stacks: just copy the whole preemption count, rather than just
the softirq parts of it.  There is no advantage to the partial
copy: it is more effort to get a less correct result.
