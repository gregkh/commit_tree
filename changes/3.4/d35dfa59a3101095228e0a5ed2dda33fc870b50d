ARM: LPC32xx: clock.c: Clock registration fixes

This patch adjusts the clock registration list, ported from the latest version
of Kevin Wells' latest version of clock.c: i2s0_ck, i2s1_ck and dev:mmc0 have
NULL pointers associated as the .dev_id and .con_id, respectively. The old
values were not useful.
