ASoC: tlv312aic23: unbreak resume

* commit f9dfbf9 "ASoC: tlv320aic23: convert to soc-cache" leads to
a bug preventing resumeof the codec as regmap expects a 9 bits data
register but 0xFFFF is passed in tlv320aic23_set_bias_level and this
values gets cached preventing any write to the TLV320AIC23_PWR
register as the final value produced by regmap is (register << 9) | value

* this patch solves the problem by only working on the 9 bits the
register contains.
