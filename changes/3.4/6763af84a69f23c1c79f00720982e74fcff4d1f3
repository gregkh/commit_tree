btrfs: Remove set bits return from clear_extent_bit

There is only one caller of clear_extent_bit that checks the return value
and it only checks if it's negative. Since there are no users of the
returned bits functionality of clear_extent_bit, stop returning it
and avoid complicating error handling.
