clk: introduce the common clock framework

The common clock framework defines a common struct clk useful across
most platforms as well as an implementation of the clk api that drivers
can use safely for managing clocks.

The net result is consolidation of many different struct clk definitions
and platform-specific clock framework implementations.

This patch introduces the common struct clk, struct clk_ops and an
implementation of the well-known clock api in include/clk/clk.h.
Platforms may define their own hardware-specific clock structure and
their own clock operation callbacks, so long as it wraps an instance of
struct clk_hw.

See Documentation/clk.txt for more details.

This patch is based on the work of Jeremy Kerr, which in turn was based
on the work of Ben Herrenschmidt.
