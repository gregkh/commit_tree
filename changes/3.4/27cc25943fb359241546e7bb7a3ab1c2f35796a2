rbd: simplify error handling in rbd_add()

If a couple pointers are initialized to NULL then a single
"out_nomem" label can be used for all of the memory allocation
failure cases in rbd_add().

Also, get rid of the "irc" local variable there.  There is no
real need for "rc" to be type ssize_t, and it can be used in
the spot "irc" was.
