SCSI & usb-storage: add flags for VPD pages and REPORT LUNS

This patch (as1507) adds a skip_vpd_pages flag to struct scsi_device
and a no_report_luns flag to struct scsi_target.  The first is used to
control whether sd will look at VPD pages for information on block
provisioning, limits, and characteristics.  The second prevents
scsi_report_lun_scan() from issuing a REPORT LUNS command.

The patch also modifies usb-storage to set the new flag bits for all
USB devices and targets, and to stop adjusting the scsi_level value.

Historically we have seen that USB mass-storage devices often don't
support VPD pages or REPORT LUNS properly.  Until now we have avoided
these things by setting the scsi_level to SCSI_2 for all USB devices.
But this has the side effect of storing the LUN bits into the second
byte of each CDB, and now we have a report of a device which doesn't
like that.  The best solution is to stop abusing scsi_level and
instead have separate flags for VPD pages and REPORT LUNS.
