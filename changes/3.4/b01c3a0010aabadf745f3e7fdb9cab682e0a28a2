perf: Move mmap page data_head offset assertion out of header

Having the build time assertion in header is making the perf
build fail on x86 with:

  ../../include/linux/perf_event.h:411:32: error: variably modified \
		‘__assert_mmap_data_head_offset’ at file scope [-Werror]

I'm moving the build time validation out of the header, because
I think it's better than to lessen the perf build warn/error
check.
