arm/PCI: remove arch pci_flags definition

The PCI core provides a pci_flags definition (currently __weak), so drop
the arm definition in favor of that.

We EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_flags) as arm did previously.  I'm dubious about
this: no other architecture exports it, and I didn't see any modules in
the tree that reference it.
