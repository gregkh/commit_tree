SUNRPC: service destruction in network namespace context

v2: Added comment to BUG_ON's in svc_destroy() to make code looks clearer.

This patch introduces network namespace filter for service destruction
function.
Nothing special here - just do exactly the same operations, but only for
tranports in passed networks namespace context.
BTW, BUG_ON() checks for empty service transports lists were returned into
svc_destroy() function. This is because of swithing generic svc_close_all() to
networks namespace dependable svc_close_net().
