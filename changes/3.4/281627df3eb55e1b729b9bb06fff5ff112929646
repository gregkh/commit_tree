xfs: log file size updates at I/O completion time

Do not use unlogged metadata updates and the VFS dirty bit for updating
the file size after writeback.  In addition to causing various problems
with updates getting delayed for far too long this also drags in the
unscalable VFS dirty tracking, and is one of the few remaining unlogged
metadata updates.
