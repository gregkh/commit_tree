compat: Add helper functions to read/write struct timeval, timespec

Add helper functions to read and write struct timeval and struct
timespec from userspace.  We already had helper functions for reading
and writing struct compat_timespec; add a set of functions to do the
same with struct timeval, and add a second suite of functions which
can be sensitive to COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME and access either 32- or
64-bit time structures.

This also exports these helper functions to modules.

Rename the existing inlines for converting between struct
compat_timeval and native struct timespec so we can have a saner
naming convention for the exported functions.
