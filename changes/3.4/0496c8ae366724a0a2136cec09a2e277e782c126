PM / Domains: Run late/early device suspend callbacks at the right time

After the introduction of the late/early phases of device
suspend/resume during system-wide power transitions it is possible
to make the generic PM domains code execute its default late/early
device suspend/resume callbacks during those phases instead of the
corresponding _noirq phases.  The _noirq device suspend/resume
phases were only used for executing those callbacks, because this
was the only way it could be done, but now we can do better.
