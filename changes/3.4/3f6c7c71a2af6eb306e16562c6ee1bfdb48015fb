untangling do_lookup() - isolate !dentry stuff from the rest of it.

Duplicate the revalidation-related parts into if (!dentry) branch.
Next step will be to pull them under i_mutex.

This and the next 8 commits are more or less a splitup of patch
by Miklos; folks, when you are working with something that convoluted,
carve your patches up into easily reviewed steps, especially when
a lot of codepaths involved are rarely hit...
