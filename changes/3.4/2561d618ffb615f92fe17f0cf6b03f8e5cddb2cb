NFS: remove RPC PipeFS mount point reference from blocklayout routines

This is a cleanup patch. We don't need this reference anymore, because
blocklayout pipes dentries now creates and destroys in per-net operations and
on PipeFS mount/umount notification.
Note that nfs4blocklayout_register_net() now returns 0 instead of -ENOENT in
case of PipeFS superblock absence. This is ok, because blocklayout pipe dentry
will be created on PipeFS mount event.
