cciss: Initialize scsi host max_sectors for tape drive support

The default is too small (1024 blocks), use h->cciss_max_sectors (8192 blocks)
Without this change, if you try to set the block size of a tape drive above
512*1024, via "mt -f /dev/st0 setblk nnn" where nnn is greater than 524288,
it won't work right.
