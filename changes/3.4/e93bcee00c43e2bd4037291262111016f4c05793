pinctrl: move generic functions to the pinctrl_ namespace

Since we want to use the former pinmux handles and mapping tables for
generic control involving both muxing and configuration we begin
refactoring by renaming them from pinmux_* to pinctrl_*.

ChangeLog v1->v2:
- Also rename the PINMUX_* macros in machine.h to PIN_ as indicated
  in the documentation so as to reflect the generic nature of these
  mapping entries from now on.
