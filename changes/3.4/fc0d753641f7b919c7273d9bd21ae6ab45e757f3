unix: Support peeking offset for stream sockets

The same here -- we can protect the sk_peek_off manipulations with
the unix_sk->readlock mutex.

The peeking of data from a stream socket is done in the datagram style,
i.e. even if there's enough room for more data in the user buffer, only
the head skb's data is copied in there. This feature is preserved when
peeking data from a given offset -- the data is read till the nearest
skb's boundary.
