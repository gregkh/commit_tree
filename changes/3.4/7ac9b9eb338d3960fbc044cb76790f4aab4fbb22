ARM: highbank: convert to twd_local_timer_register() interface

Add support for the new smp_twd runtime registration interface
to the highbank platforms, and remove the old compile-time support.

The highbank DTS file is updated to match the TWD DT documentation
and fixes the timer trigger (rising edge).
