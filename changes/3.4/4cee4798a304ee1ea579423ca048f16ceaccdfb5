KVM: x86 emulator: Allow PM/VM86 switch during task switch

Task switches can switch between Protected Mode and VM86. The current
mode must be updated during the task switch emulation so that the new
segment selectors are interpreted correctly.

In order to let privilege checks succeed, rflags needs to be updated in
the vcpu struct as this causes a CPL update.
