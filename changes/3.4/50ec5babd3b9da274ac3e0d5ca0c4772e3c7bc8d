[SCSI] pm8001: Fix possible racing condition.

There is a possble racing scenario.

'process_oq' is called by two routines, as shown below.

pm8001_8001_dispatch = {
         .......

        .isr             = pm8001_chip_isr --> process_oq,// A
        .isr_process_oq  = process_oq,                   //  B
        .....
}

process_oq() --> process_one_iomb() --> mpi_sata_completion()

In 'mpi_sata_completion', "pm8001_ha->lock" is first released.
It means lock is taken before,  which is true for
the context A, as 'pm8001_ha->lock' is taken in 'pm8001_chip_isr()'

But for context B there is no lock taken before and pm8001_ha->lock
is unlocked in 'mpi_sata_completion()'. This may unlock the lock
taken in context A. Possible racing ??

If 'pm8001_ha->lock' is taken in 'process_oq()' instead of
'pm8001_chip_isr' then the above issue can be avoided.
