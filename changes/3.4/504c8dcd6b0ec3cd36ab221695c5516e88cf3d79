Bluetooth: mgmt: Fix update_eir/class with HCI_AUTO_OFF flag set

If we're powered but still have the HCI_AUTO_OFF flag set the
update_eir and update_class functions should not do anything.
Additionally these functions need to be called when the flag is finally
cleared through set_powered or when powering on for real.
