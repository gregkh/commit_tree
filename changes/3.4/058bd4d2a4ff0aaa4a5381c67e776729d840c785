net: Convert printks to pr_<level>

Use a more current kernel messaging style.

Convert a printk block to print_hex_dump.
Coalesce formats, align arguments.
Use %s, __func__ instead of embedding function names.

Some messages that were prefixed with <foo>_close are
now prefixed with <foo>_fini.  Some ah4 and esp messages
are now not prefixed with "ip ".

The intent of this patch is to later add something like
  #define pr_fmt(fmt) "IPv4: " fmt.
to standardize the output messages.

Text size is trivially reduced. (x86-32 allyesconfig)
