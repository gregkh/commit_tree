[S390] rework idle code

Whenever the cpu loads an enabled wait PSW it will appear as idle to the
underlying host system. The code in default_idle calls vtime_stop_cpu
which does the necessary voodoo to get the cpu time accounting right.
The udelay code just loads an enabled wait PSW. To correct this rework
the vtime_stop_cpu/vtime_start_cpu logic and move the difficult parts
to entry[64].S, vtime_stop_cpu can now be called from anywhere and
vtime_start_cpu is gone. The correction of the cpu time during wakeup
from an enabled wait PSW is done with a critical section in entry[64].S.
As vtime_start_cpu is gone, s390_idle_check can be removed as well.
