iio: core: constitfy available_scan_mask

The core must not modify available_scan_mask, because it causes problems
with drivers where multiple instances of the driver share the same mask set.
So make this explicit by marking available scan masks as const.

The max1363 driver needs some minor adjustment to accommodate this change.
Pull scan mask allocation into a separate function.
