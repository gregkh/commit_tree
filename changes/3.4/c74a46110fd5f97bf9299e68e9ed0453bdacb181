tipc: Remove duplicate check of message destination node

Eliminates a check in the processing of TIPC messages arriving from
off node that ensures the message is destined for this node, since this
check duplicates an earlier check. (The check would be necessary if TIPC
needed to be able to route incoming messages to another node, but the
elimination of multi-cluster support means that this never happens and
all incoming messages are consumed by the receiving node.)

Note: This change involves the elimination of a single "if" statement
with a large "then" clause; consequently, a significant number of lines
end up getting re-indented. In addition, a simple message header access
routine that is no longer referenced is eliminated. However, the only
functional change is the elimination of the single check described above.
