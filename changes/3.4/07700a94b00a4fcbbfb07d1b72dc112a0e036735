KVM: Allow host IRQ sharing for assigned PCI 2.3 devices

PCI 2.3 allows to generically disable IRQ sources at device level. This
enables us to share legacy IRQs of such devices with other host devices
when passing them to a guest.

The new IRQ sharing feature introduced here is optional, user space has
to request it explicitly. Moreover, user space can inform us about its
view of PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE so that we can avoid unmasking the
interrupt and signaling it if the guest masked it via the virtualized
PCI config space.
