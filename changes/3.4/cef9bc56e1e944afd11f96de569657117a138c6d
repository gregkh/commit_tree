Dynamic ID addition doesn't need get_driver()

As part of the removal of get_driver()/put_driver(), this patch
(as1511) changes all the places that add dynamic IDs for drivers.
Since these additions are done by writing to the drivers' sysfs
attribute files, and the attributes are removed when the drivers are
unregistered, there is no reason to take an extra reference to the
drivers.

The one exception is the pci-stub driver, which calls pci_add_dynid()
as part of its registration.  But again, there's no reason to take an
extra reference here, because the driver can't be unloaded while it is
being registered.
