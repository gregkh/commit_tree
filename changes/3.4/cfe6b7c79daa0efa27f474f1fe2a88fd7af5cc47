um: switch line.c tty drivers to dynamic device creation

Current code doesn't update the symlinks in /sys/dev/char when we add/remove
tty lines.  Fixing that allows to stop messing with ->valid before the driver
registration, which is a Good Thing(tm) - we shouldn't have it set before we
really have the things set up and ready for line_open().

We need tty_driver available to call tty_{un,}register_device(), so we just
stash a reference to it into struct line_driver.
