HWPOISON: Add code to handle "action required" errors.

Add new flag bit "MF_ACTION_REQUIRED" to be used by machine check
code to force a signal with si_code = BUS_MCEERR_AR in the case
where the error occurs in processor execution context. Pass the
flags argument along call chain:
	memory_failure()
	  hwpoison_user_mappings()
	    kill_procs()
	      kill_proc()

Drop the "_ao" suffix from kill_procs_ao() and kill_proc_ao() since
they can now handle "action required" as well as "action optional" errors.
