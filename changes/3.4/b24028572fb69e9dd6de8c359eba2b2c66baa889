memcg: remove PCG_CACHE page_cgroup flag

We record 'the page is cache' with the PCG_CACHE bit in page_cgroup.
Here, "CACHE" means anonymous user pages (and SwapCache).  This doesn't
include shmem.

Considering callers, at charge/uncharge, the caller should know what the
page is and we don't need to record it by using one bit per page.

This patch removes PCG_CACHE bit and make callers of
mem_cgroup_charge_statistics() to specify what the page is.

About page migration: Mapping of the used page is not touched during migra
tion (see page_remove_rmap) so we can rely on it and push the correct
charge type down to __mem_cgroup_uncharge_common from end_migration for
unused page.  The force flag was misleading was abused for skipping the
needless page_mapped() / PageCgroupMigration() check, as we know the
unused page is no longer mapped and cleared the migration flag just a few
lines up.  But doing the checks is no biggie and it's not worth adding
another flag just to skip them.
