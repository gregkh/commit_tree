drivers/rtc/rtc-twl.c: use static register while reading time

RTC stores time and date in several registers.  Due to the fact that
these registers can't be read instantaneously, there is a chance that
reading from counting registers gives an error of one minute, one hour,
one day, etc.

To address this issue, the RTC has hardware support to copy the RTC
counting registers to static shadowed registers.  The current
implementation does not use this feature, and in a stress test, we can
reproduce this error at a rate of around two times per 300000 readings.

Fix the implementation to ensure that the right snapshot of time is
captured.
