gpiolib: Add comments explaining the _cansleep() WARN_ON()s

I've seen users getting very confused by the WARN_ON()s for can_sleep
GPIOs in the atomic-safe paths, the discoverability of the non-atomic
version of the API seems to be hampered by the fact that it's defined
in a header file not the .c file where the warnings are.

Add a couple of comments next to the warnings to help people on their
way.
