pktgen: fix module unload for good

commit c57b5468406 (pktgen: fix crash at module unload) did a very poor
job with list primitives.

1) list_splice() arguments were in the wrong order

2) list_splice(list, head) has undefined behavior if head is not
initialized.

3) We should use the list_splice_init() variant to clear pktgen_threads
list.
