ASoC: wm8994: Prevent ABBA deadlock with CODEC and accdet mutexes

Currently we can the accdet mutex from within DAPM when updating the device
state which means we take accdet then the CODEC mutex but we also do the
locking the other way around when responding to the jackdet IRQ. Move all
the jackdet use of the CODEC mutex out of the accdet lock to avoid this.
Since all the DAPM interactions depend only on a single threaded IRQ this
is still serialised.

The locking improvements in 3.5 allow a better solution there.
