memcg: simplify move_account() check

In memcg, for avoiding take-lock-irq-off at accessing page_cgroup, a
logic, flag + rcu_read_lock(), is used.  This works as following

     CPU-A                     CPU-B
                             rcu_read_lock()
    set flag
                             if(flag is set)
                                   take heavy lock
                             do job.
    synchronize_rcu()        rcu_read_unlock()
    take heavy lock.

In recent discussion, it's argued that using per-cpu value for this flag
just complicates the code because 'set flag' is very rare.

This patch changes 'flag' implementation from percpu to atomic_t.  This
will be much simpler.
