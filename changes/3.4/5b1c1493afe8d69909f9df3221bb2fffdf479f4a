KVM: s390: ucontrol: export SIE control block to user

This patch exports the s390 SIE hardware control block to userspace
via the mapping of the vcpu file descriptor. In order to do so,
a new arch callback named kvm_arch_vcpu_fault  is introduced for all
architectures. It allows to map architecture specific pages.
