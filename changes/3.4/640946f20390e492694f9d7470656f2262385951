dentry leak in simple_fill_super() failure exit

d_genocide() does _not_ evict dentries; it just removes extra ref
pinning each of those.  Normally it's followed by shrinking the
tree (it's done just before generic_shutdown_super() by kill_litter_super()),
but in case of simple_fill_super() nothing of that kind will follow.
Just do shrink_dcache_parent() manually.
