gpio/omap: cleanup set_gpio_triggering function

Getting rid of ifdefs within the function by adding register offset intctrl
and associating OMAPXXXX_GPIO_INT_CONTROL in respective SoC specific files.
Also, use wkup_status register consistently instead of referring to wakeup
clear and wakeup set register offsets. Get rid of cpu_is_xxxx checks in
set_gpio_trigger() using irqctrl.
