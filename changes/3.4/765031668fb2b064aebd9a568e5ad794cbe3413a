HID: logitech: fix mask to enable DJ mode

The user can only experience the bug if she pairs 6 devices to a Unifying
receiver. The sixth paired device would not work.

The value changed is actually a bitmask that enables reporting from each
paired device. As the sixth bit was not set, the sixth device reports are
ignored by the receiver and never get to the driver.
