[SCSI] pm8001: Fix bogus interrupt state flag issue.

Static checker is giving following warning:
" error: calling 'spin_unlock_irqrestore()' with bogus flags"

The code flow is as shown below:
process_oq() --> process_one_iomb --> mpi_sata_completion

In 'mpi_sata_completion'
the first call for 'spin_unlock_irqrestore()' is with flags=0,
which is as good as 'spin_unlock_irq()' ( unconditional interrupt
enabling).

So for better performance 'spin_unlock_irqrestore()' can be replaced
with 'spin_unlock_irq()' and 'spin_lock_irqsave()' can be replaced by
'spin_lock_irq()'.
