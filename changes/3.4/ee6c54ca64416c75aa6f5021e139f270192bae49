rtc/rtc-spear: call platform_set_drvdata() before registering rtc device

rtc_device_register() calls rtc-spear routines internally.  These
routines call dev_get_drvdata() to get struct spear_rtc_config.
Currently, platform_set_drvdata is called after rtc device is
registered.  This causes system to crash, as dev_get_drvdata returns
NULL.

For this we need to call platform_set_drvdata() before registering rtc
device.  This requires further cleanup, that leads to removal of
dev_set_drvdata on rtc->dev, which was just not required at all.

Also, we change the parameter to request_irq and pass pointer to config
instead of pointer to rtc struct.

This patch brings all above changes.
