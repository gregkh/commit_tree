ASoC: core: Add support for DAI and machine kcontrols.

Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device
handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for
SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to
the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily
get it's private data.

This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing
calls (card and dai are new) :-

snd_soc_add_card_controls()
snd_soc_add_codec_controls()
snd_soc_add_dai_controls()
snd_soc_add_platform_controls()

This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers
to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().

It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().

Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-

1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required.
2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.

In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct
component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer
via the codec pointer).
