[SCSI] foce: remove bh disable from fcoe sw transport rcv function

The fcoe sw recive packet function (fcoe_rcv) only ever executes in softirq
context.  Given that, and the fact that no use of the fcoe_rx_list is made in
irq context, its not necessecary to disable bottom halves while actually
receiving the frame.  Convert spin_*_bh calls in that function to their
lock-only equivalents
