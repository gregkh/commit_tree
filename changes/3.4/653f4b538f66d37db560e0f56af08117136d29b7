ACPICA: Expand OSL memory read/write interfaces to 64 bits

This change expands acpi_os_read_memory and acpi_os_write_memory to a
full 64 bits. This allows 64 bit transfers via the acpi_read and
acpi_write interfaces. Note: The internal acpi_hw_read and acpi_hw_write
interfaces remain at 32 bits, because 64 bits is not needed to
access the standard ACPI registers.
