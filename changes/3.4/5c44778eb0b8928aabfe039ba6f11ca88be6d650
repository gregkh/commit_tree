video: s3c-fb: Add support EXYNOS5 FIMD

This patch adds s3c_fb_driverdata s3c_fb_data_exynos5 for EXYNOS5
and adds extended timing control setting.

EXYNOS5 FIMD needs extended setting for video timing control.
Additional bits are added to VIDTCON2, VIDWxxADD2, VIDOSDxA and
VIDOSDxB registers in order to set timing value for lager resolution.

Also, address offset of VIDTCONx registers is changed from 0x0
to 0x20000, thus variable type should be changed to int type
to handle the address offset of VIDTCONx registers for EXYNOS5 FIMD.
