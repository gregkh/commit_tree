ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix mem leak (and rid us of trailing whitespace).

In sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c::alc_auto_fill_dac_nids(), in the
'for (;;)' loop, if the 'badness' value returned from
fill_and_eval_dacs() is negative, then we'll return from the function
without freeing the memory we allocated for 'best_cfg', thus leaking.
Fix the leak by kfree()'ing the memory when badness is negative.

While I was there I also noticed some trailing whitespace in the
function that I removed (along with all other trailing whitespace in
the file) - it didn't seem worth-while to do that as two patches, so I
hope it's OK that I just did it all as one patch.
