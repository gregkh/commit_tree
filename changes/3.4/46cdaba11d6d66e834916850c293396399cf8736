ARM: S3C24XX: Reuse S3C2443 dma for S3C2416

The dma controller is similar in S3C2443 and S3C2416 and has also
the same register layout with the same REQSEL-bits in the source
select.

The only small difference is the SIO channel of the S3C2443 for the
non-hsmmc controller which is not present on S3C2416/2450 and
second spi channel which is not present on the S3C2416.
