hwmon: (w83795) Unconditionally support manual fan speed control

Manual fan speed control uses a standard interface and has received
sufficient testing and review by now, it can be enabled
unconditionally. This includes attributes pwm[1-8], pwm[1-8]_enable,
pwm[1-8]_mode and pwm[1-8]_freq.

We only let the user switch from automatic mode to manual mode, but
not the other way around, as automatic control settings may not have
been set properly by the BIOS.
