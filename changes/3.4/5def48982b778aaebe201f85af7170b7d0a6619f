mtd: do not duplicate length and offset checks in drivers

We already verify that offset and length are within the MTD device size
in the MTD API functions. Let's remove the duplicated checks in drivers.
This patch only affects the following API's:

'mtd_erase()'
'mtd_point()'
'mtd_unpoint()'
'mtd_get_unmapped_area()'
'mtd_read()'
'mtd_write()'
'mtd_panic_write()'
'mtd_lock()'
'mtd_unlock()'
'mtd_is_locked()'
'mtd_block_isbad()'
'mtd_block_markbad()'

This patch adds a bit of noise by removing too sparse empty lines, but this is
not too bad.
