ARM: 7330/1: ftrace: use canonical Thumb-2 wide instruction format

As commit 592201a9f15 (ARM: Thumb-2: Support Thumb-2 in undefined
instruction handler) says:

    32-bit Thumb instructions are specified in the form:
        ((first_half << 16 ) | second_half)
    which matches the layout used by the ARM ARM.

Convert the ftrace code to use the same format to avoid the usage of
different formats in kernel code.
