ARM: 7294/1: vectors: use gate_vma for vectors user mapping

The current user mapping for the vectors page is inserted as a `horrible
hack vma' into each task via arch_setup_additional_pages. This causes
problems with the MM subsystem and vm_normal_page, as described here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/14/55

Following the suggestion from Hugh in the above thread, this patch uses
the gate_vma for the vectors user mapping, therefore consolidating
the horrible hack VMAs into one.
