mtd: maps: pcmciamtd: Add reference counter to set_vpp()

This patch is part of a set which fixes unnecessary flash erase and write errors
resulting from the MTD CFI driver turning off vpp while an erase is in progress.
This patch allows pcmciamtd_set_vpp() calls to be nested by adding a reference
counter.
