gpio/omap: use pm-runtime framework

Call runtime pm APIs pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put()
for enabling/disabling clocks appropriately. Remove syscore_ops and
instead use SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS macro.

There is no more need to call omap_device_disable_idle_on_suspend
since driver is PM runtime adapted now.
