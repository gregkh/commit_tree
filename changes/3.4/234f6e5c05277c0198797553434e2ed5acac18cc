orinoco: Remove old mailing lists from MAINTAINERS

The two orinoco mailing lists on sourceforge were set up many years
ago and are now more or less moribund.  I'd like to shut them down, so
I don't have to keep filtering the spam from them (which is most of
what comes through now).  In preparation, this patch removes the
reference to them from the MAINTAINERS file.  Any remaining discussion
of this approaching obsolete driver can go to the linux-wireless list.
