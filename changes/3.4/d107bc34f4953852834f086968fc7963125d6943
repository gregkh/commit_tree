mtd: docg3 reduce read alignment burden

The read function was so far requiring the reads to be aligned on page
boundaries, and be page length multiples in size. Relieve these
constraints to ease the userspace ubifs programs runs, which read ubifs
headers of 64 bytes.

Artem: squashed a later fix from Robert Jarzmik into this patch.
