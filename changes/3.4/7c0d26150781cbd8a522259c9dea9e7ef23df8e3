microblaze: Fix mapin_ram function

Fix how many pages are allocated in mapin_ram. It is lowmem_size
not setup CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE because it is the same for all systems.
Which means that wrong pages are allocated if memory size is smaller
than CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE. It has dramatic impact on bootup time.
On sp605 MMU full hw design is 7s.
