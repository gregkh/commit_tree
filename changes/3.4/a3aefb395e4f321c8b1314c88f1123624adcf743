dm persistent data: remove redundant value_size arg from value_ptr

Now that the value_size is held within every node of the btrees we can
remove this argument from value_ptr().

For the last few months a BUG_ON has been checking this argument is
the same as that held in the node.  No issues were reported.  So this
is a safe change.
