mmc: core: hs200 fixes

This patch fixes following issues when HS200 is enabled:

1. If executing_tuning() host ops is called without mmc_host_clk_hold(),
   card clocks might get turned off (if MMC_CLK_GATING is enabled)
   while execute_tuning() is in progress. So this patch makes sure
   that execute_tuning() is called with mmc_host_clk_hold().

2. If host timing mode is set to HS200 mode, there should not be
   any communication with the card until execute_tuning() is completed.
   But there is a chance that CMD6 might be sent to enable set HPI_EN
   (of HPI_MGMT field in EXT_CSD) before execute_tuning() is called.
   So this patch moves this operation after execute_tuning() is completed.
