powerpc/eeh: pseries platform EEH operations

There're 4 EEH operations that are covered by the dedicated RTAS
call <ibm,set-eeh-option>: enable or disable EEH, enable MMIO and
enable DMA. At early stage of system boot, the EEH would be tried
to enable on PCI device related device node. MMIO and DMA for
particular PE should be enabled when doing recovery on EEH errors
so that the PE could function properly again.

The patch implements it and abstract that through struct
eeh_ops::set_eeh. It would be help for EEH to support multiple
platforms in future.
