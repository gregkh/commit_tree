x86-64: Fix CFI annotations for NMI nesting code

The saving and restoring of %rdx wasn't annotated at all, and the
jumping over sections where state gets partly restored wasn't handled
either.

Further, by folding the pushing of the previous frame in repeat_nmi
into that which so far was immediately preceding restart_nmi (after
moving the restore of %rdx ahead of that, since it doesn't get used
anymore when pushing prior frames), annotations of the replicated
frame creations can be made consistent too.

v2: Fully fold repeat_nmi into the normal code flow (adding a single
    redundant instruction to the "normal" code path), thus retaining
    the special protection of all instructions between repeat_nmi and
    end_repeat_nmi.
