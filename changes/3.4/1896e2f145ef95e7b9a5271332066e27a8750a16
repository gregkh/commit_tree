OMAPFB: Remove video SRAM support (old omapfb)

OMAP SRAM can be used as video memory on OMAP1 and 2. However, there
usually is very little SRAM available, thus limiting its use, and no
board supported by the kernel currently uses it.

This patch removes the use of SRAM as video ram for the old omapfb
driver to simplify memory handling.
