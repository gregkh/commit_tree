TTY: pty, remove superfluous ptm test

The code looks like:
if (tty->driver->subtype == PTY_TYPE_MASTER) {
  ...
  if (tty->driver == ptm_driver)

But the second if is superfluous because only the ptm_driver is of
PTY_TYPE_MASTER subtype.

Also we can remove the #if now because devpts_pty_kill is defined as
an empty function for non-CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS configs.
