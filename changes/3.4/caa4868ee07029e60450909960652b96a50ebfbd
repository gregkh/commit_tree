ARM: tegra: add support for tegra30 interrupts

Tegra30 has 1 extra legacy interrupt controller. Use the GIC ITLinesNumber
field to determine how many interrupt controllers we have and initialize
appropriately. Also make room for the extra tegra30 interrupts by moving
the GPIO IRQ base. This shouldn't affect existing code as it determines the
correct IRQ number for GPIOs using TEGRA_GPIO_TO_IRQ().
