PM / Sleep: Make enter_state() in kernel/power/suspend.c static

The enter_state() function in kernel/power/suspend.c should be
static and state_store() in kernel/power/suspend.c should call
pm_suspend() instead of it, so make that happen (which also reduces
code duplication related to suspend statistics).
