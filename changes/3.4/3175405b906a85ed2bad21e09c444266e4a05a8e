Bluetooth: Return updated name state with hci_inquiry_cache_update

If user-space has already confirmed the name for a remote device we
shouldn't request confirmation again. The simplest way to do this is to
return the name state from hci_inquiry_cache_update (if it is anything
else than unknown then we do not need confirmation from user-space).
