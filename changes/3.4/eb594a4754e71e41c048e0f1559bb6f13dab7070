powerpc/eeh: pseries platform PE state retrieval

On pSeries platform, there're 2 dedicated RTAS calls introduced to
retrieve the corresponding PE's state: ibm,read-slot-reset-state and
ibm,read-slot-reset-state2.

The patch implements the retrieval of PE's state according to the
given PE address. Besides, the implementation has been abstracted by
struct eeh_ops::get_state so that EEH core components could support
multiple platforms in future.
