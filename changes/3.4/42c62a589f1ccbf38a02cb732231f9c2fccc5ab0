sched/rt: Keep period timer ticking when rt throttling is active

When a runqueue is throttled we cannot disable the period timer
because that timer is the only way to undo the throttling.

We got stale throttling entries when a rq was throttled and then the
global sysctl was disabled, which stopped the timer.
