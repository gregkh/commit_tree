btrfs: Add btrfs_panic()

As part of the effort to eliminate BUG_ON as an error handling
technique, we need to determine which errors are actual logic errors,
which are on-disk corruption, and which are normal runtime errors
e.g. -ENOMEM.

Annotating these error cases is helpful to understand and report them.

This patch adds a btrfs_panic() routine that will either panic
or BUG depending on the new -ofatal_errors={panic,bug} mount option.
Since there are still so many BUG_ONs, it defaults to BUG for now but I
expect that to change once the error handling effort has made
significant progress.
