consolidate WARN_...ONCE() static variables

Due to the alignment of following variables, these typically consume
more than just the single byte that 'bool' requires, and as there are a
few hundred instances, the cache pollution (not so much the waste of
memory) sums up.  Put these variables into their own section, outside of
any half way frequently used memory range.

Do the same also to the __warned variable of rcu_lockdep_assert().
(Don't, however, include the ones used by printk_once() and alike, as
they can potentially be hot.)
