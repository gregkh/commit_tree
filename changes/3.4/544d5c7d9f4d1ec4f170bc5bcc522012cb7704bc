netfilter: ctnetlink: allow to set expectfn for expectations

This patch allows you to set expectfn which is specifically used
by the NAT side of most of the existing conntrack helpers.

I have added a symbol map that uses a string as key to look up for
the function that is attached to the expectation object. This is
the best solution I came out with to solve this issue.
