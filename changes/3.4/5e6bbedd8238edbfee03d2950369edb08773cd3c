drivers/net: strip unused module code from sun3_82586.c

This code is clearly unused, since it has a #error right
in it.  Given the vintage of sun3 hardware, it is probably
safe to assume that there is little interest in adding new
functionality to the driver now, so just delete the unused
block of code.
