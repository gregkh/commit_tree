[SCSI] libsas: revert ata srst

libata issues follow up srsts when the controller has a hard time
recording the signature-fis after a reset, or if the link supports port
multipliers.  libsas does not support port multipliers and no current
libsas lldds appear to need help retrieving the signature fis.  Revert
it for now to remove confusion.
