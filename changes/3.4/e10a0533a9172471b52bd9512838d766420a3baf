iwlwifi: add wrappers for command sending

Add wrappers to send commands from the DVM
op-mode (which essentially consists of the
current driver). This will allow us to move
specific sanity checks there.

Also, this removes iwl_trans_send_cmd_pdu()
since that can now be taken care of in the
DVM-specific wrapper.
