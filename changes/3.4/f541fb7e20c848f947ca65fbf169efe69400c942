dccp: fix bug in sequence number validation during connection setup

This fixes a bug in the sequence number validation during the initial handshake.

The code did not treat the initial sequence numbers ISS and ISR as read-only and
did not keep state for GSR and GSS as required by the specification. This causes
problems with retransmissions during the initial handshake, causing the
budding connection to be reset.

This patch now treats ISS/ISR as read-only and tracks GSS/GSR as required.
