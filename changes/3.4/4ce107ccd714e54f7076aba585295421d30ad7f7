ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix wrong SYSC_TYPE1_XXX_MASK bit definitions

In the SYSC_TYPE1_XXX_MASK configuration, SYSC_XXX_SHIFT macro
is used which is not defined anywhere in the kernel.
Until now the build was going through successfully, since it
is not being used anywhere in kernel.

This bug got introduced by the commit
358f0e630d5409ab3837b86db3595560eae773b6 ("OMAP3: hwmod: support
to specify the offset position of various SYSCONFIG register bits.")
