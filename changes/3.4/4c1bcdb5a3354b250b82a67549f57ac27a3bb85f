wl1251: fix crash on remove due to leftover work item

This driver currently leaves elp_work behind when stopping, which
occasionally results in data corruption because work function ends
up accessing freed memory, typical symptoms of this are various
worker_thread crashes. Fix it by cancelling elp_work.
