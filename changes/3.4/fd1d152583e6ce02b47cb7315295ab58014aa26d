HID: multitouch: add more eGalax devices

This is a list of devices that should be handled by hid-multitouch.  They all
present the HID usage "Contact ID" and won't be handled by hid-input.  Some of
them have _not_ been tested (though I have their report descriptors), but I've
been guaranted by eeti that they follow the same protocol.  The tested ones are
also blacklisted in hid-core.c.
