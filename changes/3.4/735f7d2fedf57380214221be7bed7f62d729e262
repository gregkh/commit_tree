[SCSI] libsas: fix domain_device leak

Arrange for the deallocation of a struct domain_device object when it no
longer has:
1/ any children
2/ references by any scsi_targets
3/ references by a lldd

The comment about domain_device lifetime in
Documentation/scsi/libsas.txt is stale as it appears mainline never had
a version of a struct domain_device that was registered as a kobject.
We now manage domain_device reference counts on behalf of external
agents.
