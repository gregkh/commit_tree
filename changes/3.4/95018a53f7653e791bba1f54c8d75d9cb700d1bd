xHCI: Correct the #define XHCI_LEGACY_DISABLE_SMI

Re-define XHCI_LEGACY_DISABLE_SMI and used it in right way. All SMI enable
bits will be cleared to zero and flag bits 29:31 are also cleared to zero.
Other bits should be presvered as Table 146.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31.
