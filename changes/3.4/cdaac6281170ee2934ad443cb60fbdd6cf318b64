wl12xx: fw api change - add role_id to set_template

The set_template commands now takes the role_id as
parameter.

Usually, we'll use the vif's main role_id.
However, sometimes we'll want to use
wlvif->dev_role_id instead of wlvif->role_id,
so pass the wanted role_id as param.

Update WL127X_FW_NAME/WL128X_FW_NAME.

(This commit starts a series of fw update patches,
and changes the start() callback to return an error
in order to prevent the use of the driver during the
transition. This change will be reverted in the
last patch of series)
