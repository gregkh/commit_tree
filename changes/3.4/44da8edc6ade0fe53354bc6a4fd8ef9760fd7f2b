powerpc/eeh: Replace pci_dn with eeh_dev for EEH sysfs

With original EEH implementation, all EEH related statistics have
been put into struct pci_dn. We've introduced struct eeh_dev to
replace struct pci_dn in EEH core components, including EEH sysfs
component.

The patch shows EEH statistics from struct eeh_dev instead of struct
pci_dn in EEH sysfs component. Besides, it also fixed the EEH device
retrieval from PCI device, which was introduced by the previous patch
in the series of patch.
