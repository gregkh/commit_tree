perf bench: Also allow measuring alternative memcpy implementations

Intended to be able to support the current selection of the preferred
memcpy() implementation, this patch adds the ability to also measure the
two alternative implementations, again by way of using some
pre-processsor replacement.

While on my Westmere system this proves that the movsb based variant is
worse than the movsq based one (since the ERMS feature isn't there), it
also shows that here for the default as well as small sizes the unrolled
variant outperforms the movsq one.
