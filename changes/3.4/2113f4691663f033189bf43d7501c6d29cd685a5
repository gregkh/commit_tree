xen: use this_cpu_xxx replace percpu_xxx funcs

percpu_xxx funcs are duplicated with this_cpu_xxx funcs, so replace them
for further code clean up.

I don't know much of xen code. But, since the code is in x86 architecture,
the percpu_xxx is exactly same as this_cpu_xxx serials functions. So, the
change is safe.
