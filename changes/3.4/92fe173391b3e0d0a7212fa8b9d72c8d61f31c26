e1000e: issues in Sx on 82577/8/9

A workaround was previously put in the driver to reset the device when
transitioning to Sx in order to activate the changed settings of the PHY
OEM bits (Low Power Link Up, or LPLU, and GbE disable configuration) for
82577/8/9 devices.  After further review, it was found such a reset can
cause the 82579 to confuse which version of 82579 it actually is and broke
LPLU on all 82577/8/9 devices.  The workaround during an S0->Sx transition
on 82579 (instead of resetting the PHY) is to restart auto-negotiation
after the OEM bits are configured; the restart of auto-negotiation
activates the new OEM bits as does the reset.  With 82577/8, the reset is
changed to a generic reset which fixes the LPLU bits getting set wrong.
