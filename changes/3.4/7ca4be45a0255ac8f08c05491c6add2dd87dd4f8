Btrfs: don't use crc items bigger than 4KB

With the big metadata blocks, we can have crc items
that are much bigger than a page.  There are a few
places that we try to kmalloc memory to hold the
items during a split.

Items bigger than 4KB don't really have a huge benefit
in efficiency, but they do trigger larger order allocations.
This commits changes the csums to make sure they stay under
4KB.  This is not a format change, just a #define to limit
huge items.
