sysctl: Create local copies of directory names used in paths

Creating local copies of directory names is a good idea for
two reasons.
- The dynamic names used by callers must be copied into new
  strings by the callers today to ensure the strings do not
  change between register and unregister of the sysctl table.

- Sysctl directories have a potentially different lifetime
  than the time between register and unregister of any
  particular sysctl table.
