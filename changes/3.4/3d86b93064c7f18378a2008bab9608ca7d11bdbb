rtlwifi: Fix PCI probe error path orphaned memory

Memory allocated by ieee80211_alloc_hw() will get orphaned
if any subsequent initializations fail.

Also don't pci_set_drvdata(pdev, NULL) until just before disabling
the PCI device. Functions called by rtl_deinit_core(hw) may eventually need
the context (when its actually implemented).
