ext3: fix start and len arguments handling in ext3_trim_fs()

The overflow might happen when passing blocknr into
ext3_get_group_no_and_offset(), because it expects type ext3_fsblk_t
which might be smaller than uint64_t. This will most likely happen when
calling FITRIM with the default argument len = ULLONG_MAX.

Fix this by using "end" variable instead of "start+len" as it is easier
to get right and specifically check that the end is not beyond the end
of the file system, so we are sure that the result of
get_group_no_and_offset() will not overflow. Otherwise truncate it to
the size of the file system.
