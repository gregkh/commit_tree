powerpc/irq: Fix another case of lazy IRQ state getting out of sync

So we have another case of paca->irq_happened getting out of
sync with the HW irq state. This can happen when a perfmon
interrupt occurs while soft disabled, as it will return to a
soft disabled but hard enabled context while leaving a stale
PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS flag set.

This patch fixes it, and also adds a test for the condition
of those flags being out of sync in arch_local_irq_restore()
when CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS is enabled.

This helps catching those gremlins faster (and so far I
can't seem see any anymore, so that's good news).
