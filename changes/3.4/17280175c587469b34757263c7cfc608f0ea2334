NFS: Fix a number of sparse warnings

Fix a number of "warning: symbol 'foo' was not declared. Should it be
static?" conditions.

Fix 2 cases of "warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer"

fs/nfs/delegation.c:263:31: warning: restricted fmode_t degrades to integer
  - We want to allow upgrades to a WRITE delegation, but should otherwise
    consider servers that hand out duplicate delegations to be borken.
