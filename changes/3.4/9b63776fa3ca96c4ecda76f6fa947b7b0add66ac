tracing: Do not enable function event with enable

With the adding of function tracing event to perf, it caused a
side effect that produces the following warning when enabling all
events in ftrace:

 # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/enable

[console]
event trace: Could not enable event function

This is because when enabling all events via the debugfs system
it ignores events that do not have a ->reg() function assigned.
This was to skip over the ftrace internal events (as they are
not TRACE_EVENTs). But as the ftrace function event now has
a ->reg() function attached to it for use with perf, it is no
longer ignored.

Worse yet, this ->reg() function is being called when it should
not be. It returns an error and causes the above warning to
be printed.

By adding a new event_call flag (TRACE_EVENT_FL_IGNORE_ENABLE)
and have all ftrace internel event structures have it set,
setting the events/enable will no longe try to incorrectly enable
the function event and does not warn.
