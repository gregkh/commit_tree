[media] dvb: earth-pt1: stop polling data when no one accesses the device

The driver started a kthread to poll the DMA buffers soon after probing,
which relsuleted in 1000/sec sleeps and wakeups of the thread doing nothing
useful until someone started feeding.
This patch changes the creation and destruction of the kthread depending on the number of users.
