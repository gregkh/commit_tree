frv: delete incorrect task prototypes causing compile fail

Commit 41101809a865 ("fork: Provide weak arch_release_[task_struct|
thread_info] functions") in -tip highlights a problem in the frv arch,
where it has needles prototypes for alloc_task_struct_node and
free_task_struct.  This now shows up as:

  kernel/fork.c:120:66: error: static declaration of 'alloc_task_struct_node' follows non-static declaration
  kernel/fork.c:127:51: error: static declaration of 'free_task_struct' follows non-static declaration

since that commit turned them into real functions.  Since arch/frv does
does not define define __HAVE_ARCH_TASK_STRUCT_ALLOCATOR (i.e.  it just
uses the generic ones) it shouldn't list these at all.
