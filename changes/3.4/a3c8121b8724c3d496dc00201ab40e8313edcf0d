x86/olpc: Add debugfs interface for EC commands

Add a debugfs interface for sending commands to the OLPC
Embedded Controller (EC) and reading the responses.  The EC
provides functionality for machine identification, battery and
AC control, wakeup control, etc.

Having a debugfs interface available is useful for EC
development and debugging.

Based on code by Paul Fox (who also approves of the end result).
