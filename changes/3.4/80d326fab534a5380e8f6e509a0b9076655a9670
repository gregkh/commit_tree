netlink: add netlink_dump_control structure for netlink_dump_start()

Davem considers that the argument list of this interface is getting
out of control. This patch tries to address this issue following
his proposal:

struct netlink_dump_control c = { .dump = dump, .done = done, ... };

netlink_dump_start(..., &c);
