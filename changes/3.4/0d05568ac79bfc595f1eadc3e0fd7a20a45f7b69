staging:rts_pstor:Fix possible panic by NULL pointer dereference

rtsx_transport.c (rtsx_transfer_sglist_adma_partial):
pointer struct scatterlist *sg, which is mapped in dma_map_sg,
is used as an iterator in later transfer operation. It is corrupted and
passed to dma_unmap_sg, thus causing fatal unmap of some erroneous address.
Fix it by duplicating *sg_ptr for iterating.
