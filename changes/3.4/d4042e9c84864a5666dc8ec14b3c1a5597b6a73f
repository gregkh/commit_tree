[SCSI] libfc: Fix panic in fc_exch_recv

Adding and removing the host into the zone causes this panic.

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000000000000a0
IP: [<ffffffffa0491707>] fc_exch_recv+0xc57/0xe70 [libfc]
Call Trace:
[<ffffffffa050e04b>] bnx2fc_l2_rcv_thread+0x37b/0x430 [bnx2fc]
[<ffffffffa050dcd0>] ? bnx2fc_l2_rcv_thread+0x0/0x430 [bnx2fc]

[<ffffffff810907f0>] ? kthread+0x0/0xa0
[<ffffffff8100c140>] ? child_rip+0x0/0x20

During fc_exch_reset, the active exchanges are aborted and the exch is deleted.
As part of processing ABTS response, due to 'ep' being NULL, any access to ep in
fc_exch_recv_bls() causes this panic. Fixed to access 'ep' only if non-NULL.
