ppp: Replace uses of <linux/if_ppp.h> with <linux/ppp-ioctl.h>

Since all that include/linux/if_ppp.h does is #include <linux/ppp-ioctl.h>,
this replaces the occurrences of #include <linux/if_ppp.h> with
#include <linux/ppp-ioctl.h>.

It also corrects an error in Documentation/networking/l2tp.txt, where
it referenced include/linux/if_ppp.h as the source of some definitions
that are actually now defined in include/linux/if_pppol2tp.h.
