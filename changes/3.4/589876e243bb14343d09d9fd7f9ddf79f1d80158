ALSA: hda/realtek - Apply probe-fixup really after probing

Move the call of alc_apply_fixup() with ALC_FIXUP_ACT_PROBE after the
whole setups of patch_ops & co, so that the fix-up function may override
the default setup.  This will be needed for installing the own unsol
event handler (e.g. for volume-knob controls).
