firewire: allow explicit flushing of iso packet completions

Extend the kernel and userspace APIs to allow reporting all currently
completed isochronous packets, even if the next interrupt packet has not
yet been reached.  This is required to determine the status of the
packets at the end of a paused or stopped stream, and useful for more
precise synchronization of audio streams.
