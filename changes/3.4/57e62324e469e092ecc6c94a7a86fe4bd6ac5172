NFS: Store the legacy idmapper result in the keyring

This patch removes the old hashmap-based caching and instead uses a
"request key actor" to place an upcall to the legacy idmapper rather
than going through /sbin/request-key.  This will only be used as a
fallback if /etc/request-key.conf isn't configured to use nfsidmap.
