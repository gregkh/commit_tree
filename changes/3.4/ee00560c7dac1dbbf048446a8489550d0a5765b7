ptrace: remove PTRACE_SEIZE_DEVEL bit

PTRACE_SEIZE code is tested and ready for production use, remove the
code which requires special bit in data argument to make PTRACE_SEIZE
work.

Strace team prepares for a new release of strace, and we would like to
ship the code which uses PTRACE_SEIZE, preferably after this change goes
into released kernel.
