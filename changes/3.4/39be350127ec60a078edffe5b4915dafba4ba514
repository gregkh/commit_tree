sched, block: Unify cache detection

The block layer has some code trying to determine if two CPUs share a
cache, the scheduler has a similar function. Expose the function used
by the scheduler and make the block layer use it, thereby removing the
block layers usage of CONFIG_SCHED* and topology bits.
