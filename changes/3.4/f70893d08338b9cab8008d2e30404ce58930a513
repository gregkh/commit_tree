i2c: tegra: Add delay before resetting the controller after NACK

NACK interrupt is generated before I2C controller generates the STOP
condition on bus. Because of this reset of controller is happening
before I2C controller could complete STOP condition. So wait for some
time before resetting the controller so that STOP condition has
delivered properly on bus.

Added delay of 2 clock period before resetting the controller in case of
NACK error.
