ACPI: Add support for exposing BGRT data

ACPI 5.0 adds the BGRT, a table that contains a pointer to the firmware
boot splash and associated metadata. This simple driver exposes it via
/sys/firmware/acpi in order to allow bootsplash applications to draw their
splash around the firmware image and reduce the number of jarring graphical
transitions during boot.
