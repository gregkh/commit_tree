ASoC: fsl: p1022ds: tell the WM8776 codec driver that it's the master

The WM8776 codec driver requires the machine driver to set one of the
SND_SOC_DAIFMT_CBx_xxx values.  The P1022DS machine driver should be setting
SND_SOC_DAIFMT_CBM_CFM, but since that value was zero, no one noticed.

Commit 75d9ac46 ("ASoC: Allow DAI formats to be specified in the
dai_link"), however, changed the value of SND_SOC_DAIFMT_CBM_CFM from zero
to a non-zero value, which means that it now needs to be specifically set
by the machine driver.

We also set SND_SOC_DAIFMT_NB_NF, for the same reason.
