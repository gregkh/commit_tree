libceph: get rid of zero_page_address

There's not a lot of benefit to zero_page_address, which basically
holds a mapping of the zero page through the life of the messenger
module.  Even with our own mapping, the sendpage interface where
it's used may need to kmap() it again.  It's almost certain to
be in low memory anyway.

So stop treating the zero page specially in write_partial_msg_pages()
and just get rid of zero_page_address entirely.
