x86, boot: Correct CFLAGS for hostprogs

This is a partial revert of commit:
    d40f833 "Restrict CFLAGS for hostprogs"

The endian-manipulation macros in tools/include need <linux/types.h>,
but the hostprogs in arch/x86/boot need several headers from the
kernel build tree, which means we have to add the kernel headers to
the include path.  This picks up <linux/types.h> from the kernel tree,
which gives a warning.

Since this use of <linux/types.h> is intentional, add
-D__EXPORTED_HEADERS__ to the command line to silence the warning.

A better way to fix this would be to always install the exported
kernel headers into $(objtree)/usr/include as a standard part of the
kernel build, but that is a lot more involved.
