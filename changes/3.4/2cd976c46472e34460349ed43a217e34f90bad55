ARM: 7223/1: mmc: mmci: Fixup use of runtime PM and use autosuspend

Added use of runtime PM autosuspend feature, with a fixed
timeout of 50 ms. This will prevent adding a latency,
although very minor, for _every_ request.

Moreover the runtime_get_sync is now also used in set_ios and
suspend since the runtime resourses are needed here as well.
