Resurrect Intel740 driver: i740fb

This is a resurrection of an old (like 2.4.19) out-of-tree driver for
Intel740 graphics cards and adaptation for recent kernels. The old driver by
Andrey Ulanov is located at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/i740fbdev/files/

This is a new driver based on skeletonfb, using most of the low level HW code
from the old driver. The DDC code is completely new.

The driver was tested on two 8MB cards: Protac AG240D and Diamond Stealth II
G460.
