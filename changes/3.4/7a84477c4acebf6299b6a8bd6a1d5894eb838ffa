mtd: fix oops in dataflash driver

I'm seeing an oops in mtd_dataflash.c with Linux 3.3. What appears to
be happening is that otp_select_filemode calls mtd_read_fact_prot_reg
with -1 for offset and length and a NULL buffer to test if OTP
operations are supported. This finds its way down to otp_read in
mtd_dataflash.c and causes an oops when memcpying the returned data
into the NULL buf.

None of the checks in otp_read catches the negative length and offset.
Changing the length of the dummy read to 0 prevents the oops.
