mtd: docg3 add protection against concurrency

As docg3 is intolerant against reentrancy, especially
because of its weird register access (ie. a register read is
performed by a first register write), each access to the
docg3 IO space must be locked.

Lock the IO space with a mutex, shared by all chips on the
same cascade, as they all share the same IO space.
