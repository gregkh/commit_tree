af_iucv: handle netdev events

In case of transport through HiperSockets the underlying network
interface may switch to DOWN state or the underlying network device
may recover. In both cases the socket must change to IUCV_DISCONN
state. If the interface goes down, af_iucv has a chance to notify
its connection peer in addition.
