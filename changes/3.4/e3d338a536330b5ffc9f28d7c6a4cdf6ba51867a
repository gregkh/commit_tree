[SCSI] libiscsi: fix cmd timeout/completion race

If the driver/lib has called scsi_done and cleaned up internally but
scsi layer has not yet called blk_mark_rq_complete when the command
times out we hit a problem if the timeout code calls blk_mark_rq_complete first.
When the time out code calls into the driver we were returning
BLK_EH_RESET_TIMER and that causes the timeout code to just call
us again later.

We need to be calling BLK_EH_HANDLED so the timeout code can complete
the completion process because it had called blk_mark_rq_complete
on the command and now owns its processing.
