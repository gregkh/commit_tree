ALSA: hda/realtek - Drop all ALC880 static quirks

Finally the all static quirks for ALC880 are converted to the
auto-parser.  Since we are never sure whether the BIOS on so many old
machines are really correct, the quirk table entries are copied as
they are, but just providing the proper pin-config values
accordingly.

Since alc880_quirks.c is removed, alc882_quirks.c has to be adjusted
slightly to be built again.  There might be some compile warnings due
to the remaining alc882 quirks, but these shall be killed sooner or
later, I don't care it much at this point.
