ACPI / PCI / PM: Fix device PM regression related to D3hot/D3cold

Commit 1cc0c998fdf2 ("ACPI: Fix D3hot v D3cold confusion") introduced a
bug in __acpi_bus_set_power() and changed the behavior of
acpi_pci_set_power_state() in such a way that it generally doesn't work
as expected if PCI_D3hot is passed to it as the second argument.

First off, if ACPI_STATE_D3 (equal to ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD) is passed to
__acpi_bus_set_power() and the explicit_set flag is set for the D3cold
state, the function will try to execute AML method called "_PS4", which
doesn't exist.

Fix this by adding a check to ensure that the name of the AML method
to execute for transitions to ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD is correct in
__acpi_bus_set_power().  Also make sure that the explicit_set flag
for ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD will be set if _PS3 is present and modify
acpi_power_transition() to avoid accessing power resources for
ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD, because they don't exist.

Second, if PCI_D3hot is passed to acpi_pci_set_power_state() as the
target state, the function will request a transition to
ACPI_STATE_D3_HOT instead of ACPI_STATE_D3.  However,
ACPI_STATE_D3_HOT is now only marked as supported if the _PR3 AML
method is defined for the given device, which is rare.  This causes
problems to happen on systems where devices were successfully put
into ACPI D3 by pci_set_power_state(PCI_D3hot) which doesn't work
now.  In particular, some unused graphics adapters are not turned
off as a result.

To fix this issue restore the old behavior of
acpi_pci_set_power_state(), which is to request a transition to
ACPI_STATE_D3 (equal to ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD) if either PCI_D3hot or
PCI_D3cold is passed to it as the argument.

This approach is not ideal, because generally power should not
be removed from devices if PCI_D3hot is the target power state,
but since this behavior is relied on, we have no choice but to
restore it at the moment and spend more time on designing a
better solution in the future.
