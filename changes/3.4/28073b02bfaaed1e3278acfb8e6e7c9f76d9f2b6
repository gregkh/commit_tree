mm: hugetlb: defer freeing pages when gathering surplus pages

When gathering surplus pages, the number of needed pages is recomputed
after reacquiring hugetlb lock to catch changes in resv_huge_pages and
free_huge_pages.  Plus it is recomputed with the number of newly allocated
pages involved.

Thus freeing pages can be deferred a bit to see if the final page request
is satisfied, though pages could be allocated less than needed.
