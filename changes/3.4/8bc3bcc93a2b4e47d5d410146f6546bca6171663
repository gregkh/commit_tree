lib: reduce the use of module.h wherever possible

For files only using THIS_MODULE and/or EXPORT_SYMBOL, map
them onto including export.h -- or if the file isn't even
using those, then just delete the include.  Fix up any implicit
include dependencies that were being masked by module.h along
the way.
