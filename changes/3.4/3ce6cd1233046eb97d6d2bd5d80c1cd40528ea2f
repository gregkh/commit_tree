ceph: avoid repeatedly computing the size of constant vxattr names

All names defined in the directory and file virtual extended
attribute tables are constant, and the size of each is known at
compile time.  So there's no need to compute their length every
time any file's attribute is listed.

Record the length of each string and use it when needed to determine
the space need to represent them.  In addition, compute the
aggregate size of strings in each table just once at initialization
time.
