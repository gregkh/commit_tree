ARM: ux500: update defconfig

Some new drivers and changed Kconfig dependencies for the v3.4
kernel affecting the U8500 defconfig:

- The SOC config options are now brought in by default
- No need to explicitly select misc devices anymore
- I2C is selected by default
- We now have support for charging from the AB8500 so compile
  in this
- The regulator framework needs to be explictly selected
