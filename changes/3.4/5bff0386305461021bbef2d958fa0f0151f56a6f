SUNRPC: remove non-exclusive pipe creation from RPC pipefs

This patch-set was created in context of clone of git branch:
git://git.linux-nfs.org/projects/trondmy/nfs-2.6.git.

v2:
1) Rebased of current repo state (i.e. all commits were pulled before apply)

I feel it is ready for inclusion if no objections will appear.

SUNRPC pipefs non-exclusive pipe creation code looks obsolete. IOW, as I see
it, all pipes are creating with unique full path and only once.
