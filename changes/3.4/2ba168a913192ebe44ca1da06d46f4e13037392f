m68knommu: clean up init code in ColdFire 523x startup

We can move the QSPI init call to the more general config_BSP() code on
the 523x platorm setup code. Then we can remove the initcall code all
together.

We can also remove the un-needed include of mcfuart.h while we are
cleaning up here too.

Also I noticed that we are not calling the fec_init() code here, and we
should be doing that. Put that back in too.
