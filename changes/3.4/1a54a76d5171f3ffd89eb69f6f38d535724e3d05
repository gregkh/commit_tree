TTY: let alloc_tty_driver deduce the owner automatically

Like the rest of the kernel, make a stub from alloc_tty_driver which
calls __alloc_tty_driver with proper owner. This will save us one more
assignment on the driver side.

Also this fixes some drivers which didn't set the owner. This allowed
user to remove the module from the system even though a tty from the
driver is still open.
