rbd: have rbd_get_client() return a rbd_client

Since rbd_get_client() currently returns an error code.  It assigns
the rbd_client field of the rbd_device structure it is passed if
successful.  Instead, have it return the created rbd_client
structure and return a pointer-coded error if there is an error.
This makes the assignment of the client pointer more obvious at the
call site.
