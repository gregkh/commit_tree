e1000e: rename e1000e_config_collision_dist() and call as function pointer

Rename e1000e_config_collision_dist() to
e1000e_config_collision_dist_generic() to signify the function is used for
more than one MAC-family type, and set and use it as a MAC ops function
pointer to be consistent with the driver design.
