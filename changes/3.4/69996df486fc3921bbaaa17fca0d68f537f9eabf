perf tools: Enable reading of perf.data files from different ABI rev

This patch allows perf to process perf.data files generated
using an ABI that has a different perf_event_attr struct size,
i.e., a different ABI version.

The perf_event_attr can be extended, yet perf needs to cope with
older perf.data files. Similarly, perf must be able to cope with
a perf.data file which is using a newer version of the ABI than
what it knows about.

This patch adds read_attr(), a routine that reads a
perf_event_attr struct from a file incrementally based on its
advertised size. If the on-file struct is smaller than what perf
knows, then the extra fields are zeroed. If the on-file struct
is bigger, then perf only uses what it knows about, the rest is
skipped.
