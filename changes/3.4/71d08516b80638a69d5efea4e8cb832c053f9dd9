ASoC: core: Add SND_SOC_BYTES control for coefficient blocks

Allow devices to export blocks of registers to the application layer,
intended for use for reading and writing coefficient data which can't
usefully be worked with by the kernel at runtime (for example, due to
requiring complex and expensive calculations or being the results of
callibration procedures). Currently drivers are using platform data to
provide configurations for coefficient blocks which isn't at all
convenient for runtime management or configuration development.

Currently only devices using regmap are supported, an error will be
generated for any attempt to work with a byte control on a non-regmap
device. There's no fundamental block to other devices so support could
be added if required.
