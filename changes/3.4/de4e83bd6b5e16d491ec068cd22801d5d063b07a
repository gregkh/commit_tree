sysctl: Register the base sysctl table like any other sysctl table.

Simplify the code by treating the base sysctl table like any other
sysctl table and register it with register_sysctl_table.

To ensure this table is registered early enough to avoid problems
call sysctl_init from proc_sys_init.

Rename sysctl_net.c:sysctl_init() to net_sysctl_init() to avoid
name conflicts now that kernel/sysctl.c:sysctl_init() is no longer
static.
