rbd: reduce memory used for rbd_dev fields

The length of the string containing the monitor address
specification(s) will never exceed the length of the string passed
in to rbd_add().  The same holds true for the ceph + rbd options
string.  So reduce the amount of memory allocated for these to
that length rather than the maximum (1024 bytes).
