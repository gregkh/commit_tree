ARM: fix lcd power build failure in collie_defconfig

Commit 086ada54abaa4316e8603f02410fe8ebc9ba2de1

  "FB: sa1100: remove global sa1100fb_.*_power function pointers"

got rid of all instances but one in locomolcd.c -- which was
conditional on CONFIG_SA1100_COLLIE.  The associated .power
field which replaces the global is populated in mach-sa1100/collie.c
so move the assignment there, but make it conditional on the
locomolcd support, so use CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_LOCOMO in that file.
