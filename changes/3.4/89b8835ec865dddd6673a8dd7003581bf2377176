x32, siginfo: Provide proper overrides for x32 siginfo_t

Provide the proper override macros for x32 siginfo_t.  The combination
of a special type here and an overall alignment constraint actually
ends up with all the types being properly aligned, but the hack is
needed to keep the substructures inside siginfo_t from adding padding.

Note: use __attribute__((aligned())) since __aligned() is not exported
to user space.
