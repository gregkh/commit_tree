wl1251: fix sparse warning

The wl1251 driver was generating the following warning:

drivers/net/wireless/wl1251/boot.c:467:21: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/net/wireless/wl1251/boot.c:467:21:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [assigned] [usertype] val
drivers/net/wireless/wl1251/boot.c:467:21:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>

Fix this by removing one cpu_to_le32() call in the wrong place.
