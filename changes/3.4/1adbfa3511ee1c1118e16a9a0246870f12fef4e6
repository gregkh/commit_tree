x86, efi: Allow basic init with mixed 32/64-bit efi/kernel

Traditionally the kernel has refused to setup EFI at all if there's been
a mismatch in 32/64-bit mode between EFI and the kernel.

On some platforms that boot natively through EFI (Chrome OS being one),
we still need to get at least some of the static data such as memory
configuration out of EFI. Runtime services aren't as critical, and
it's a significant amount of work to implement switching between the
operating modes to call between kernel and firmware for thise cases. So
I'm ignoring it for now.

v5:
* Fixed some printk strings based on feedback
* Renamed 32/64-bit specific types to not have _ prefix
* Fixed bug in printout of efi runtime disablement

v4:
* Some of the earlier cleanup was accidentally reverted by this patch, fixed.
* Reworded some messages to not have to line wrap printk strings

v3:
* Reorganized to a series of patches to make it easier to review, and
  do some of the cleanups I had left out before.

v2:
* Added graceful error handling for 32-bit kernel that gets passed
  EFI data above 4GB.
* Removed some warnings that were missed in first version.
