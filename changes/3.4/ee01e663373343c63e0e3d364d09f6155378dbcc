cpuidle: Fix panic in CPU off-lining with no idle driver

Fix a NULL pointer dereference panic in cpuidle_play_dead() during
CPU off-lining when no cpuidle driver is registered.  A cpuidle
driver may be registered at boot-time based on CPU type.  This patch
allows an off-lined CPU to enter HLT-based idle in this condition.
