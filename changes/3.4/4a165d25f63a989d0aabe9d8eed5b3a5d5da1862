ext2: No longer export ext2_fs.h to user space

Since the on-disk format has been stable for quite some time, users
should either use the headers provided by libext2fs or keep a private
copy of this header. For the full discussion, see this thread:

While at it, this commit removes all __KERNEL__ guards, which are now
unnecessary.
