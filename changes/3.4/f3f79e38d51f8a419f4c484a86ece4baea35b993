genirq: Get rid of unneeded force parameter in irq_finalize_oneshot()

The only place irq_finalize_oneshot() is called with force parameter set
is the threaded handler error exit path. But IRQTF_RUNTHREAD is dropped
at this point and irq_wake_thread() is not going to set it again,
since PF_EXITING is set for this thread already. So irq_finalize_oneshot()
will drop the threads bit in threads_oneshot anyway and hence the force
parameter is superfluous.
