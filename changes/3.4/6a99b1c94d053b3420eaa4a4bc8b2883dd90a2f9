ACPICA: Object repair code: Support to add Package wrappers

Repair a common problem with objects that are defined to return
a variable-length Package of sub-objects. If there is only one
sub-object, some BIOS code mistakenly simply declares the single
object instead of a Package with one sub-object.  This function
attempts to repair this error by wrapping a Package object around
the original object, creating the correct and expected Package
with one sub-object.
