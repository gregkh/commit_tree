KVM: x86 emulator: Fix task switch privilege checks

Currently, all task switches check privileges against the DPL of the
TSS. This is only correct for jmp/call to a TSS. If a task gate is used,
the DPL of this take gate is used for the check instead. Exceptions,
external interrupts and iret shouldn't perform any check.
