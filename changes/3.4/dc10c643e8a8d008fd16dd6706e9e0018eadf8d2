md: allow re-add to failed arrays.

When an array is failed (some data inaccessible) then there is no
point attempting to add a spare as it could not possibly be recovered.

However that may be value in re-adding a recently removed device.
e.g. if there is a write-intent-bitmap and it is clear, then access
to the data could be restored by this action.

So don't reject a re-add to a failed array for RAID10 and RAID5 (the
only arrays  types that check for a failed array).
