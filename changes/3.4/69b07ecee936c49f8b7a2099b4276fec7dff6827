mmc: omap_hsmmc: Get rid of omap_hsmmc_1_set_power function

Use omap_hsmmc_235_set_poweri() (now renamed as omap_hsmmc_set_power())
for MMC1 instance as well and get rid of omap_hsmmc_1_set_power()
completely.

omap_hsmmc_235_set_power() seems to be implemented as a superset of
omap_hsmmc_1_set_power() with additional functionality implemented
based on additional checks and hence should just work for MMC1
as well.
