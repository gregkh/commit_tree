net: fix /proc/net/dev regression

Commit f04565ddf52 (dev: use name hash for dev_seq_ops) added a second
regression, as some devices are missing from /proc/net/dev if many
devices are defined.

When seq_file buffer is filled, the last ->next/show() method is
canceled (pos value is reverted to value prior ->next() call)

Problem is after above commit, we dont restart the lookup at right
position in ->start() method.

Fix this by removing the internal 'pos' pointer added in commit, since
we need to use the 'loff_t *pos' provided by seq_file layer.

This also reverts commit 5cac98dd0 (net: Fix corruption
in /proc/*/net/dev_mcast), since its not needed anymore.
