arch/ia64: remove references to cpu_*_map

This was marked as obsolete for quite a while now..  Now it is time to
remove it altogether.  And while doing this, get rid of first_cpu() as
well.  Also, remove the redundant setting of cpu_online_mask in
smp_prepare_cpus() because the generic code would have already set cpu 0
in cpu_online_mask.
