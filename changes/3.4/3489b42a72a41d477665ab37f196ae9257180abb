ceph: fix three bugs, two in ceph_vxattrcb_file_layout()

In ceph_vxattrcb_file_layout(), there is a check to determine
whether a preferred PG should be formatted into the output buffer.
That check assumes that a preferred PG number of 0 indicates "no
preference," but that is wrong.  No preference is indicated by a
negative (specifically, -1) PG number.

In addition, if that condition yields true, the preferred value
is formatted into a sized buffer, but the size consumed by the
earlier snprintf() call is not accounted for, opening up the
possibilty of a buffer overrun.

Finally, in ceph_vxattrcb_dir_rctime() where the nanoseconds part of
the time displayed did not include leading 0's, which led to
erroneous (sub-second portion of) time values being shown.

This fixes these three issues:
