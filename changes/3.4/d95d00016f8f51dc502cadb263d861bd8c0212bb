[SCSI] pm8001: Add FUNC_GET_EVENTS

Jack noticed I dropped a patch fragment associated with a flags automatic
variable in mpi_set_phys_g3_with_ssc (ooops) and that the pre-emptive locking
that piggy-backed this patch was not in-fact necessary because of underlying
atomic accesses to the hardware. Here is the updated patch fixing these two
issues.

The pm8001 driver is missing the FUNC_GET_EVENTS handler in the phy control
function. Since the pm8001_bar4_shift function was not designed to be called
at runtime, added locking surrounding the adjustment for all accesses.
