NFSD: Fix nfs4_verifier memory alignment

Clean up due to code review.

The nfs4_verifier's data field is not guaranteed to be u32-aligned.
Casting an array of chars to a u32 * is considered generally
hazardous.

We can fix most of this by using a __be32 array to generate the
verifier's contents and then byte-copying it into the verifier field.

However, there is one spot where there is a backwards compatibility
constraint: the do_nfsd_create() call expects a verifier which is
32-bit aligned.  Fix this spot by forcing the alignment of the create
verifier in the nfsd4_open args structure.

Also, sizeof(nfs4_verifer) is the size of the in-core verifier data
structure, but NFS4_VERIFIER_SIZE is the number of octets in an XDR'd
verifier.  The two are not interchangeable, even if they happen to
have the same value.
