mtd: fsmc: Move ALE, CLE defines to their respective platform

Address Latch Enable (ALE) and Command Latch Enable (CLE) defines are
platform specific and were wrongly put in driver specific fsmc.h file.
Move such defines to their respective platform.

Also instead of relying on fsmc driver, pass ALE, CLE offsets explicitly
from individual platform.
