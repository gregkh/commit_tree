[SCSI] bfa: Fix to avoid vport delete hang on request queue full scenario.

Fixed the LPS (Logical Port Services) state machine to send a
FDISC/FLOGI to the FW from the request queue wait state, when
there is space available again on the request queue.
Made changes to free the vport on LOGO/cleanup complete instead
of free'ing it from vport_delete_handler in the module unload scenario.
