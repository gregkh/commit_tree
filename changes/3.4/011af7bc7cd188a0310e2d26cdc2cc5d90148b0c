drivers/leds/leds-lp5521.c: support led pattern data

The lp5521 has autonomous operation mode without external control.
Using lp5521_platform_data, various led patterns can be configurable.
For supporting this feature, new functions and device attribute are
added.

Structure of lp5521_led_pattern: 3 channels are supported - red, green
and blue.  Pattern(s) of each channel and numbers of pattern(s) are
defined in the pla= tform data.  Pattern data are hexa codes which
include pattern commands such like set pwm, wait, ramp up/down, branch
and so on.

Pattern mode functions:
 * lp5521_clear_program_memory
	Before running new led pattern, program memory should be cleared.
 * lp5521_write_program_memory
	Pattern data updated in the program memory via the i2c.
 * lp5521_get_pattern
	Get pattern from predefined in the platform data.
 * lp5521_run_led_pattern
	Stop current pattern or run new pattern.
	Transition time is required between different operation mode.

Device attribute - 'led_pattern': To load specific led pattern, new device
attribute is added.

When the lp5521 driver is unloaded, stop current led pattern mode.

Documentation updated : description about how to define the led patterns
and example.
