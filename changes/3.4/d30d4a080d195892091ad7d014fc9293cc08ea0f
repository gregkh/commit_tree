perf tools: Remove unnecessary ctype.h inclusion

There are unnecessary #include <ctype.h> out there, and they might cause
a nasty build failure in some environment. As we already have most of
ctype macros in util.h, just get rid of them.

A few of exceptions are util/symbol.c which needs isupper() macro util.h
doesn't provide and perl scripting support code which includes ctype.h
internally.
