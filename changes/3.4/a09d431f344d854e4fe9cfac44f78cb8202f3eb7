drm/radeon: fix load detect on rn50 with hardcoded EDIDs.

When the force changes went in back in 3.3.0, we ended up returning
disconnected in the !force case, and the connected in when forced,
as it hit the hardcoded check.

Fix it so all exits go via the hardcoded check and stop spurious
modesets on platforms with hardcoded EDIDs.
