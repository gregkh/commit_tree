clockevents: tTack broadcast device mode change in tick_broadcast_switch_to_oneshot()

In the commit 77b0d60c5adf39c74039e2142a1d3cd1e4d53799,
"clockevents: Leave the broadcast device in shutdown mode when not needed",
we were bailing out too quickly in tick_broadcast_switch_to_oneshot(),
with out tracking the broadcast device mode change to 'TICKDEV_MODE_ONESHOT'.

This breaks the platforms which need broadcast device oneshot services during
deep idle states. tick_broadcast_oneshot_control() thinks that it is
in periodic mode and fails to take proper decisions based on the
CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_[ENTER, EXIT] notifications during deep
idle entry/exit.

Fix this by tracking the broadcast device mode as 'TICKDEV_MODE_ONESHOT',
before leaving the broadcast HW device in shutdown mode if there are no active
requests for the moment.
