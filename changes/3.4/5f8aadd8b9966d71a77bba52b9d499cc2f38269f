CLONE_PARENT shouldn't allow to set ->exit_signal

The child must not control its ->exit_signal, it is the parent who
decides which signal the child should use for notification.

This means that CLONE_PARENT should not use "clone_flags & CSIGNAL",
the forking task is the sibling of the new process and their parent
doesn't control exit_signal in this case.

This patch uses ->exit_signal of the forking process, but perhaps
we should simply use SIGCHLD.

We read group_leader->exit_signal lockless, this can race with the
ORIGINAL_SIGNAL -> SIGCHLD transition, but this is fine.

Potentially this change allows to kill self_exec_id/parent_exec_id.
