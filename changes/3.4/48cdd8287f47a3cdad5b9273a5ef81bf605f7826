xen/cpufreq: Disable the cpu frequency scaling drivers from loading.

By using the functionality provided by "[CPUFREQ]: provide
disable_cpuidle() function to disable the API."

Under the Xen hypervisor we do not want the initial domain to exercise
the cpufreq scaling drivers. This is b/c the Xen hypervisor is
in charge of doing this as well and we can end up with both the
Linux kernel and the hypervisor trying to change the P-states
leading to weird performance issues.
