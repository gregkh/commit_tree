[SCSI] libsas: restore scan order

ata devices are always scanned after ssp.  Prior to the ata error
handling reworks libsas would tend to scan devices in ascending expander
phy order.  Restore this ordering by deferring ssp discovery to a
DISCE_PROBE event, and keep the probe order consistent with the
discovery order, not the placement of sata devices.
