[media] v4l: Add driver for Micron MT9M032 camera sensor

The MT9M032 is a parallel 1.6MP sensor from Micron controlled through I2C.

The driver creates a V4L2 subdevice. It currently supports cropping, gain,
exposure and v/h flipping controls in monochrome mode with an
external pixel clock.

[Lots of clean up, fixes and enhancements]
