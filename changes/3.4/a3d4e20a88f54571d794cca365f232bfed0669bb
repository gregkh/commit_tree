Bluetooth: Sort to-be-resolved devices by RSSI during discovery

This patch makes sure that devices with stronger signal (RSSI closer to
0) are sorted first in the resolve list and will therefore get their
names resolved first during device discovery. Since it's more likely
that the device the user is trying to discover has a strong signal due
to its proximity this ensures that the user gets the "device found"
event for it more quickly.
