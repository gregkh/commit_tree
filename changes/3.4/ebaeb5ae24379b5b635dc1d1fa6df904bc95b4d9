fadump: Convert firmware-assisted cpu state dump data into elf notes.

When registered for firmware assisted dump on powerpc, firmware preserves
the registers for the active CPUs during a system crash. This patch reads
the cpu register data stored in Firmware-assisted dump format (except for
crashing cpu) and converts it into elf notes and updates the PT_NOTE program
header accordingly. The exact register state for crashing cpu is saved to
fadump crash info structure in scratch area during crash_fadump() and read
during second kernel boot.
