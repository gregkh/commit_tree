arch/tile: fix finv_buffer_remote() for tilegx

There were some correctness issues with this code that are now fixed
with this change.  The change is likely less performant than it could
be, but it should no longer be vulnerable to any races with memory
operations on the memory network while invalidating a range of memory.
This code is run infrequently so performance isn't critical, but
correctness definitely is.
