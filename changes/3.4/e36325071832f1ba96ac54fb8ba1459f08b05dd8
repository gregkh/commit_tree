drm/radeon/kms: fix the regression of DVI connector check

The check of the encoder type in the commit [e00e8b5e: drm/radeon/kms:
fix analog load detection on DVI-I connectors] is obviously wrong, and
it's the culprit of the regression on my workstation with DVI-analog
connection resulting in the blank output.

Fixed the typo now.
