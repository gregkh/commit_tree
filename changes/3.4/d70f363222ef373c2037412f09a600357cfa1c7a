ALSA: hda/conexant - Set up the missing docking-station pins

ThinkPad 410,420,510,520 and X201 with cx50585 & co chips have the
docking-station ports, but BIOS doesn't initialize for these pins.
Thus, like the former X200, we need to set up the pins manually in the
driver.

The odd part is that the same PCI SSID is used for X200 and T400, thus
we need to prepare individual fixup tables for cx5051 and others.
