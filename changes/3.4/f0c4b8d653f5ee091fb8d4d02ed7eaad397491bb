ARM: 7396/1: errata: only handle ARM erratum #326103 on affected cores

Erratum #326103 ("FSR write bit incorrect on a SWP to read-only memory")
only affects the ARM 1136 core prior to r1p0. The workaround
disassembles the faulting instruction to determine whether it was a read
or write access on all v6 cores.

An issue has been reported on the ARM 11MPCore whereby loading the
faulting instruction may happen in parallel with that page being
unmapped, resulting in a deadlock due to the lack of TLB broadcasting
in hardware:

This patch limits the workaround so that it is only used on affected
cores, which are known to be UP only. Other v6 cores can rely on the
FSR to indicate the access type correctly.
