cpufreq: Add support for x86 cpuinfo auto loading v4

This marks all the x86 cpuinfo tables to the CPU specific device drivers,
to allow auto loading by udev. This should simplify the distribution
startup scripts for this greatly.

I didn't add MODULE_DEVICE_IDs to the centrino and p4-clockmod drivers,
because those probably shouldn't be auto loaded and the acpi driver
be used instead (not fully sure on that, would appreciate feedback)

The old nforce drivers autoload based on the PCI ID.

ACPI cpufreq is autoloaded in another patch.

v3: Autoload gx based on PCI IDs only. Remove cpu check (Dave Jones)
v4: Use newly introduce HW_PSTATE feature for powernow-k8 loading
