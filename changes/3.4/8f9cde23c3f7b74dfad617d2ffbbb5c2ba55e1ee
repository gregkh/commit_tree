staging:iio:adc:adt7310/7410 sticking plaster fix for broken event attrs.

Neither of these drivers has ever been anywhere near the iio abi.
Probably as a result of this the fact they had two event groups
each was not picked up when we restricted IIO to having only
1 event line per device (as part of the chrdev merge set).

As such these definitely didn't work before.  This patch squishes
the only element from the 'comparator' event line that isn't in the
'interrupt' one into it and kills off the 'comparator' one.

Ultimately both of these drivers belong in hwmon not IIO and are just
waiting here because I don't want to kill off a driver that may
prove useful to someone.  (Ultimately I will ask Greg to scrap
these two if no one steps up to deal with them.)
