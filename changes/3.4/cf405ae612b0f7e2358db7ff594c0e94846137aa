xen/smp: Fix crash when booting with ACPI hotplug CPUs.

When we boot on a machine that can hotplug CPUs and we
are using 'dom0_max_vcpus=X' on the Xen hypervisor line
to clip the amount of CPUs available to the initial domain,
we get this:

(XEN) Command line: com1=115200,8n1 dom0_mem=8G noreboot dom0_max_vcpus=8 sync_console mce_verbosity=verbose console=com1,vga loglvl=all guest_loglvl=all

With this patch, we cap the amount of vCPUS that the initial domain
can run, to exactly what dom0_max_vcpus=X has specified.

In the future, if there is a hypercall that will allow a running
domain to expand past its initial set of vCPUS, this patch should
be re-evaluated.
