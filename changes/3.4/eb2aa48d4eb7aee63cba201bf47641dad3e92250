dm thin: prepare to support discard

This patch contains the ground work needed for dm-thin to support discard.

  - Adds endio function that replaces shared_read_endio.

  - Introduce an explicit 'quiesced' flag into the new_mapping structure.
    Before, this was implicitly indicated by m->list being empty.

  - The map_info->ptr remains constant for the duration of a bio's trip
    through the thin target.  Make it easier to reason about it.
