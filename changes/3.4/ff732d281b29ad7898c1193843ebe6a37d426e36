[media] media: Initialize the media core with subsys_initcall()

Media-related drivers living outside drivers/media/ (such as the UVC
gadget driver in drivers/usb/gadget/) rely on the media core being
initialized before they're probed. As drivers/usb/ is linked before
drivers/media/, this is currently not the case and will lead to crashes
if the drivers are not compiled as modules.

Register media_devnode_init() as a subsys_initcall() instead of
module_init() to fix this.
