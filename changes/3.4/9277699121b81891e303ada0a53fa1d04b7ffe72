[SCSI] isci: fix interpretation of "hard" reset

A hard reset to isci in the direct-attached case is one where the driver
internally manages debouncing the link.  In the sas-expander-attached
case a hard reset is one that clears affiliations.  The driver should
not be prematurely dropping affiliations at run time, that decision (to
force expander hard resets to ata devices) is left to userspace to
manage.  So, arrange for I_T_nexus resets to be sas-link-resets in the
expander-attached case and isci-hard-resets in the direct-attached case.
