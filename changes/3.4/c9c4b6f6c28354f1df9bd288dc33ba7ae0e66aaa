drm/i915: fix swizzle detection for gen3

It looks like the desktop variants of i915 and i945 also have the DCC
register to control dram channel interleave and cpu side bit6
swizzling.

Unfortunately internal Cspec/ConfigDB documentation for these ancient chips
have already been dropped and there seem to be no archives. Also
somebody thought the swizzling behaviour is surely a worthy secret to
keep and redacted any mention of these fields from the published Intel
datasheets.

I suspect the hw engineers were really proud of the page coloring
they've achieved in their first dual channel dram controller with
bit17 - after all Bspec explains in great length the optimal layout of
page frame numbers modulo 4 for the color and depth buffers, too.
Later on when they've started to work on VT-d they shamefully
discoverd their stupidity and tried to cover the tracks ...
