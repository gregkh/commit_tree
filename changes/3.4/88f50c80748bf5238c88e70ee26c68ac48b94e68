drm/radeon/kms: add htile support to the cs checker v3

For 6xx+.  Required for mesa to use htile support for HiZ/HiS.
Userspace will check radeon version 2.14 with is bumped either
by tiling patch or stream out patch. This patch only add support
for htile relocation which should be enough for any userspace
to implement the hyperz (using htile buffer) feature.

v2: Jerome: Fix size checking for htile buffer.
v3: Jerome: Adapt on top of r600/evergreen cs checker changes,
            also check htile surface in case only stencil is
            present.
