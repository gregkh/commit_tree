vfs: check i_nlink limits in vfs_{mkdir,rename_dir,link}

New field of struct super_block - ->s_max_links.  Maximal allowed
value of ->i_nlink or 0; in the latter case all checks still need
to be done in ->link/->mkdir/->rename instances.  Note that this
limit applies both to directoris and to non-directories.
