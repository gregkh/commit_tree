xHCI: count free TRBs on transfer ring

In the past, the room_on_ring() check was implemented by walking all over
the ring, which is wasteful and complicated.

Count the number of free TRBs instead. The free TRBs number should be
updated when enqueue/dequeue pointer is updated, or upon the completion
of a set dequeue pointer command.
