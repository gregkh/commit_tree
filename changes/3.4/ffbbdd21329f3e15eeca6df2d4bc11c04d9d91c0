spi: create a message queueing infrastructure

This rips the message queue in the PL022 driver out and pushes
it into (optional) common infrastructure. Drivers that want to
use the message pumping thread will need to define the new
per-messags transfer methods and leave the deprecated transfer()
method as NULL.

Most of the design is described in the documentation changes that
are included in this patch.

Since there is a queue that need to be stopped when the system
is suspending/resuming, two new calls are implemented for the
device drivers to call in their suspend()/resume() functions:
spi_master_suspend() and spi_master_resume().

ChangeLog v1->v2:
- Remove Kconfig entry and do not make the queue support optional
  at all, instead be more agressive and have it as part of the
  compulsory infrastructure.
- If the .transfer() method is implemented, delete print a small
  deprecation notice and do not start the transfer pump.
- Fix a bitrotted comment.
ChangeLog v2->v3:
- Fix up a problematic sequence courtesy of Chris Blair.
- Stop rather than destroy the queue on suspend() courtesy of
  Chris Blair.
