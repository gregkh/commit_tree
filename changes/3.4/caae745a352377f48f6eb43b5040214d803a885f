drm/i915: Fix single msg gmbus_xfers writes

gmbus_xfer with a single message (particularly a single message write) would
set Bus Cycle Select to 100b, the Gen Stop cycle, instead of 101b,
No Index, Stop cycle. This would not start single message i2c transactions.

Also, gmbus_xfer done: will disable the interface without checking if
it is idle. In the case of writes, there will be no wait on status or delay
to ensure the write starts and completes before the interface is turned off.

Fixed the former issue by using the same cycle selection as used in the
I2C_M_RD for the write case.
GMBUS_CYCLE_WAIT | (i + 1 == num ? GMBUS_CYCLE_STOP : 0)
Fixed the latter by waiting on GMBUS_ACTIVE to deassert before disable.

Note from the grumpy d-i-n maintainer: The first hunk that changes the
gmbus read path is just cosmetics to align the code with the write
path.  I.e. the commit message above is slightly lying because the
first issue is _only_ with writes (and not simply "particularly").
