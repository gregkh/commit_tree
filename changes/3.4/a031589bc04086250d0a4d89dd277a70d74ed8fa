sparc/PCI: convert devtree and arch-probed bus addresses to resource

Normal PCI enumeration via PCI config space uses __pci_read_base(), where
the PCI core applies any bus-to-resource offset.  But sparc sometimes
reads PCI config space itself, and sometimes it gets addresses from the
device tree.

In ac1edcc579b6, I converted sparc to use the PCI core bus-to-resource
conversion, but I missed these sparc-specific paths.  I don't have a way
to test it, but I think sparc is broken between that commit and this one.

This patch replaces the sparc-specific pci_resource_adjust() with the
generic pcibios_bus_to_resource() in the following paths:

    pci_cfg_fake_ranges()       (addresses read from PCI config)
    apb_fake_ranges()           (addresses computed based on PCI config)
    of_scan_pci_bridge()        (addresses from OF "ranges" property)

N.B.: Resources of non-P2P bridge devices are set in pci_parse_of_addrs()
and, as far as I can see, never converted to CPU addresses.  I do not
understand why these would be treated differently than bridge windows.
