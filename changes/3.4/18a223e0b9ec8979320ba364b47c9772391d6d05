tcp: fix tcp_rcv_rtt_update() use of an unscaled RTT sample

Fix a code path in tcp_rcv_rtt_update() that was comparing scaled and
unscaled RTT samples.

The intent in the code was to only use the 'm' measurement if it was a
new minimum.  However, since 'm' had not yet been shifted left 3 bits
but 'new_sample' had, this comparison would nearly always succeed,
leading us to erroneously set our receive-side RTT estimate to the 'm'
sample when that sample could be nearly 8x too high to use.

The overall effect is to often cause the receive-side RTT estimate to
be significantly too large (up to 40% too large for brief periods in
my tests).
