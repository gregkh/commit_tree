TTY: tty_driver, document tty->ops->shutdown limitation

Note that tty->ops->shutdown is called from whatever context the user
drops the last tty reference from. E.g. if one takes a reference in
an ISR, tty close happens on other CPU and the final tty put is from
the ISR, tty->ops->shutdown will be called from that hard irq context.

We would have a problem in vt if we start using tty refcounting from
other contexts than user there. It is because vt's shutdown uses
mutexes. This is yet to be fixed.
