x86, efi: Fix pointer math issue in handle_ramdisks()

"filename" is a efi_char16_t string so this check for reaching the end
of the array doesn't work.  We need to cast the pointer to (u8 *) before
doing the math.

This patch changes the "filename" to "filename_16" to avoid confusion in
the future.
