[media] s5p-fimc: Replace the crop ioctls with VIDIOC_S/G_SELECTION

Add support for cropping and composition setup on the video capture
node through VIDIOC_S/G_SELECTION ioctls. S/G_CROP, CROPCAP ioctls
are still  supported for applications since the core will translate
them to *_selection handler calls.
