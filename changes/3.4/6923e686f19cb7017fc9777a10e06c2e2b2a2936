xfs: do not require an ioend for new EOF calculation

Replace xfs_ioend_new_eof with a new inline xfs_new_eof helper that
doesn't require and ioend, and is available also outside of xfs_aops.c.

Also make the code a bit more clear by using a normal if statement
instead of a slightly misleading MIN().
