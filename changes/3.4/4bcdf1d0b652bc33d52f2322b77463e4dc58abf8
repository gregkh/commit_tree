genirq: Get rid of unnecessary irqaction field in task_struct

When a new thread handler is created, an irqaction is passed to it as
data. Not only that irqaction is stored in task_struct by the handler
for later use, but also a structure associated with the kernel thread
keeps this value as long as the thread exists.

This fix kicks irqaction out off task_struct. Yes, I introduce new bit
field. But it allows not only to eliminate the duplicate, but also
shortens size of task_struct.
