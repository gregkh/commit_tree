KVM: PPC: Add generic single register ioctls

Right now we transfer a static struct every time we want to get or set
registers. Unfortunately, over time we realize that there are more of
these than we thought of before and the extensibility and flexibility of
transferring a full struct every time is limited.

So this is a new approach to the problem. With these new ioctls, we can
get and set a single register that is identified by an ID. This allows for
very precise and limited transmittal of data. When we later realize that
it's a better idea to shove over multiple registers at once, we can reuse
most of the infrastructure and simply implement a GET_MANY_REGS / SET_MANY_REGS
interface.
