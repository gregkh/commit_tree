serial: introduce generic port in/out helpers

Looking at the existing serial drivers (esp. the 8250 derived
variants) we see a common trend.  They create a hardware specific
port struct, which in turn contains a generic serial_port struct.

The other trend, is that they all create some sort of shortcut
to go through the hardware specific struct, to the serial_port
struct, which has the basic in/out operations within.  Looking
for the serial_in and serial_out in several drivers shows this.

Rather than let this continue, lets create a generic set of
similar helper wrappers that can be used on a struct port, so
we can eliminate bouncing out through hardware specific struct
pointers just to come back into struct port where possible.
