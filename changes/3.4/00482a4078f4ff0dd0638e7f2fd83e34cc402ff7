ARM: at91: implement the standby function for pm/cpuidle

This patch groups the self-refresh on/cpu_do_idle/self-refresh off into
a single 'standby' function.

The standby routine for rm9200 has been turned into an asm routine to have
a better control of the self refresh and to prevent a memory access when
running this code.

Draining the write buffer is done automatically when switching for the self
refresh on sam9, so the instruction is added to the rm9200 only.
