tcm_loop: Set residual field for SCSI commands

If the target core signals an over- or under-run, tcm_loop should call
scsi_set_resid() to tell the SCSI midlayer about the residual data length.

The difference can be seen by doing something like

    strace -eioctl sg_raw -r 1024 /dev/sda 8 0 0 0 1 0 > /dev/null

and looking at the "resid=" part of the SG_IO ioctl -- after this patch,
the field is correctly reported as 512.
