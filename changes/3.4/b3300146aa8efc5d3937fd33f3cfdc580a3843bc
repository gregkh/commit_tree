phy:icplus:fix Auto Power Saving in ip101a_config_init.

This patch fixes Auto Power Saving configuration in ip101a_config_init
which was broken as there is no phy register write followed after
setting IP101A_APS_ON flag.

This patch also fixes the return value of ip101a_config_init.

Without this patch ip101a_config_init returns 2 which is not an error
accroding to IS_ERR and the mac driver will continue accessing 2 as
valid pointer to phy_dev resulting in memory fault.
