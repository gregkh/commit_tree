irq_domain: Move irq_virq_count into NOMAP revmap

This patch replaces the old global setting of irq_virq_count that is only
used by the NOMAP mapping and instead uses a revmap_data property so that
the maximum NOMAP allocation can be set per NOMAP irq_domain.

There is exactly one user of irq_virq_count in-tree right now: PS3.
Also, irq_virq_count is only useful for the NOMAP mapping.  So,
instead of having a single global irq_virq_count values, this change
drops it entirely and added a max_irq argument to irq_domain_add_nomap().
That makes it a property of an individual nomap irq domain instead of
a global system settting.
