drm/i915: merge gmbus and gpio i2c adpater into one

... and directly call the newly exported i2c bit-banging functions.

The code is still pretty convoluted because we only set up the gpio
i2c stuff when actually falling back, resulting in more complexity
than necessary. This will be fixed up in the next patch.

v2: Use exported i2c_bit_algo vtable instead of exported functions.
