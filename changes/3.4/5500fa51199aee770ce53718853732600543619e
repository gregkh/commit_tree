ftrace, perf: Add filter support for function trace event

Adding support to filter function trace event via perf
interface. It is now possible to use filter interface
in the perf tool like:

  perf record -e ftrace:function --filter="(ip == mm_*)" ls

The filter syntax is restricted to the the 'ip' field only,
and following operators are accepted '==' '!=' '||', ending
up with the filter strings like:

  ip == f1[, ]f2 ... || ip != f3[, ]f4 ...

with comma ',' or space ' ' as a function separator. If the
space ' ' is used as a separator, the right side of the
assignment needs to be enclosed in double quotes '"', e.g.:

  perf record -e ftrace:function --filter '(ip == do_execve,sys_*,ext*)' ls
  perf record -e ftrace:function --filter '(ip == "do_execve,sys_*,ext*")' ls
  perf record -e ftrace:function --filter '(ip == "do_execve sys_* ext*")' ls

The '==' operator adds trace filter with same effect as would
be added via set_ftrace_filter file.

The '!=' operator adds trace filter with same effect as would
be added via set_ftrace_notrace file.

The right side of the '!=', '==' operators is list of functions
or regexp. to be added to filter separated by space.

The '||' operator is used for connecting multiple filter definitions
together. It is possible to have more than one '==' and '!='
operators within one filter string.
