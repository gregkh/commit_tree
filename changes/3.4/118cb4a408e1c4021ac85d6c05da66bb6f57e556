ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix regression on Quanta/Gericom KN1

Through the transition to the auto-parser, the support for
Quanta/Gericom KN1 got broken.  There are two problems behind it:

- This machine doesn't like the default COEF setup for ALC260 we take
  now as default

- BIOS doesn't set the pins correctly at all; especially the machine
  uses only the pin 0x0f for both headphone and speaker

This patch adds the fixup as a workaround for these issues.
