mtd: mtdblock: call mtd_sync() only if opened for write

Because it is useless to call it if the device is opened in R/O mode, and also
harmful: on CFI NOR flash it may block for long time waiting for erase
operations to complete is another partition with a R/W file-system on this
chip.

Artem Bityutskiy: write commit message, amend the patch to match the latest
tree (we use mtd_sync(), not mtd->sync() nowadays).
