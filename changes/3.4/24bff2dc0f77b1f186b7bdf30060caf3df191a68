perf report: Fix annotate double quit issue in branch view mode

This patch fixes perf report to not go back two levels when
pressing the 'q' key while annotating in branch view mode.

When pressing 'q' in annotate mode and if the branch source
and target belong to different functions, perf now brings
up the annotation popup menu again to offer the option to
annotate the other branch source or target.

As part of the code restructuring in perf_evsel__hists_browse()
we also fix a memory leak on options[] in case of error.
