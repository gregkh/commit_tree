arch/tile: fix single-stepping over swint1 instructions on tilegx

If we are single-stepping and make a syscall, we call ptrace_notify()
explicitly on the return path back to user space, since we are returning
to a pc value set artificially to the next instruction, and otherwise
we won't register that we stepped over the syscall instruction (swint1).
