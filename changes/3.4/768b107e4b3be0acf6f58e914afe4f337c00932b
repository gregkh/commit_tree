drm/i915: disable sdvo hotplug on i945g/gm

Chris Wilson dug out a hw erratum saying that there's noise on the
interrupt line on i945G chips. We also have a bug report from a i945GM
chip with an sdvo hotplug interrupt storm (and no apparent cause).

Play it safe and disable sdvo hotplug on all i945 variants.

Note that this is a regression that has been introduced in 3.1,
when we've enabled sdvo hotplug support with
