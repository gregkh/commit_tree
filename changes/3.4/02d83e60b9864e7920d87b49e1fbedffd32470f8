mac80211: fix ieee80211_set_disassoc() sending DelBA

When ieee80211_set_disassoc() is called with the
tx argument set to true, it will send DelBA out
to the peer. This isn't useful or necessary in a
few cases where we do it today, those being when
we lost the connection or when the supplicant
explicitly asked us to not tell the AP.
