tcp: fix TCP_MAXSEG for established IPv6 passive sockets

Commit f5fff5d forgot to fix TCP_MAXSEG behavior IPv6 sockets, so IPv6
TCP server sockets that used TCP_MAXSEG would find that the advmss of
child sockets would be incorrect. This commit mirrors the advmss logic
from tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock in tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock. Eventually this
logic should probably be shared between IPv4 and IPv6, but this at
least fixes this issue.
