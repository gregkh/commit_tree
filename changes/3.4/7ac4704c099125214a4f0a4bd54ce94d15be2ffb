usb/storage: a couple defines from drivers/usb/storage/transport.h to include/linux/usb/storage.h

This moves the BOT data structures for CBW and CSW from drivers internal
header file to global include able file in include/.
The storage gadget is using the same name for CSW but a different for
CBW so I fix it up properly. The same goes for the ub driver and keucr
driver in staging.
