gpio/davinci: fix enabling unbanked GPIO IRQs

Unbanked GPIO IRQ handling code made a copy of just
the irq_chip structure for GPIO IRQ lines which caused
problems after the generic IRQ chip conversion because
there was no valid irq_chip_type structure with the
right "regs" populated. irq_gc_mask_set_bit() was
therefore accessing random addresses.

Fix it by making a copy of irq_chip_type structure
instead. This will ensure sane register offsets.
