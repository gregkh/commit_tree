rcu: Hold off RCU_FAST_NO_HZ after timer posted

This commit handles workloads that transition quickly between idle and
non-idle, and where the CPU's callbacks cannot be invoked, but where
RCU does not have anything immediate for the CPU to do.  Without this
patch, the RCU_FAST_NO_HZ code can be invoked repeatedly on each entry
to idle.  The commit sets the per-CPU rcu_dyntick_holdoff variable to
hold off further attempts for a tick.
