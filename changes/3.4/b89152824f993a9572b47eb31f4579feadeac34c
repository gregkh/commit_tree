mmc: unbreak sdhci-esdhc-imx on i.MX25

This was broken by me in 37865fe91582582a6f6c00652f6a2b1ff71f8a78
("mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: fix timeout on i.MX's sdhci") where more
extensive tests would have shown that read or write of data to the
card were failing (even if the partition table was correctly read).
