KVM: Ensure all vcpus are consistent with in-kernel irqchip settings

If some vcpus are created before KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP, then
irqchip_in_kernel() and vcpu->arch.apic will be inconsistent, leading
to potential NULL pointer dereferences.

Fix by:
- ensuring that no vcpus are installed when KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP is called
- ensuring that a vcpu has an apic if it is installed after KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP

This is somewhat long winded because vcpu->arch.apic is created without
kvm->lock held.

Based on earlier patch by Michael Ellerman.
