HID: multitouch: add control of the feature "Maximum Contact Number"

Some devices, like Perixx Peripad 701 do not work if the feature
"Maximum Contact Number" is not set to the right value.
This patch allows hid-multitouch to control this feature.

If the programmer fills the field maxcontacts in the mt_class,
then the driver will set the feature to this value. It is safe
for current drivers as the feature is read/write in the HID norm
and all devices should implement the norm.
