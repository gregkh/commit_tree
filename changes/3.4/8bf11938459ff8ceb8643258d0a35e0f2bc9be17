intel_idle: Revert change of auto_demotion_disable_flags for Nehalem

Commit b66b8b9a4a79087dde1b358a016e5c8739ccf186 ('intel-idle: convert
to x86_cpu_id auto probing') added a distinction between Nehalem and
Westemere processors and changed auto_demotion_disable_flags for the
former to 0.  This was not explained in the commit message, so change
it back.
