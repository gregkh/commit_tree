bnx2x: off by one in bnx2x_ets_e3b0_sp_pri_to_cos_set()

The sp_pri_to_cos[] array size depends on the config but lets say it is
BX_E3B0_MAX_NUM_COS_PORT0 and max_num_of_cos is also
DCBX_E3B0_MAX_NUM_COS_PORT0.  In the original code
"pri == max_num_of_cos" was accepted but it is one past the end of the
array.

Also we used "pri" before capping it.  It's a harmless read past the end
of the array, but it would affect which error message gets printed.
