compat: Fix RT signal mask corruption via sigprocmask

compat_sys_sigprocmask reads a smaller signal mask from userspace than
sigprogmask accepts for setting.  So the high word of blocked.sig[0]
will be cleared, releasing any potentially blocked RT signal.

This was discovered via userspace code that relies on get/setcontext.
glibc's i386 versions of those functions use sigprogmask instead of
rt_sigprogmask to save/restore signal mask and caused RT signal
unblocking this way.

As suggested by Linus, this replaces the sys_sigprocmask based compat
version with one that open-codes the required logic, including the merge
of the existing blocked set with the new one provided on SIG_SETMASK.
