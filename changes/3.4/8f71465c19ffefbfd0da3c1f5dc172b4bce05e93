cifs: don't cap ra_pages at the same level as default_backing_dev_info

While testing, I've found that even when we are able to negotiate a
much larger rsize with the server, on-the-wire reads often end up being
capped at 128k because of ra_pages being capped at that level.

Lifting this restriction gave almost a twofold increase in sequential
read performance on my craptactular KVM test rig with a 1M rsize.

I think this is safe since the actual ra_pages that the VM requests
is run through max_sane_readahead() prior to submitting the I/O. Under
memory pressure we should end up with large readahead requests being
suppressed anyway.
