[media] media i.MX27 camera: improve discard buffer handling

The way discard buffer was previously handled lead
to possible races that made a buffer that was not
yet ready to be overwritten by new video data. This
is easily detected at 25fps just adding "#define DEBUG"
to enable the "memset" check and seeing how the image
is corrupted.

A new "discard" queue and two discard buffers have
been added to make them flow trough the pipeline
of queues and thus provide suitable event ordering.
