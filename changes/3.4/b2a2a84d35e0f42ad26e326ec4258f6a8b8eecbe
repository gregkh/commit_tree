mtd: phram: dot not crash when built-in and passing boot param

This patch is based on Ville Herva's similar patch to block2mtd.

Trying to pass a parameter through the kernel command line when built-in would
crash the kernel, as phram_setup() was called so early that kmalloc() was not
functional yet.

This patch only saves the parameter string at the early boot stage, and parses
it later when init_phram() is called. The same happens in both module and
built-in cases.

With this patch, I can boot with a statically-compiled phram, and mount a
ext2 root fs from physical RAM, without the need for a initrd.

This has been tested in built-in and module cases, with and without a
parameter string.
