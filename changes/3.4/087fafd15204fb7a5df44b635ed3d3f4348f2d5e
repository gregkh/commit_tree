Introduce CONFIG_GENERIC_IO

There are situations where CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM is too restrictive.
For example CONFIG_MTD_NAND_NANDSIM depends on CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM
but it works perfectly fine if an architecture without io memory
just includes asm-generic/io.h or implements everything defined in it.
UML is such a corner case.
