TTY: speakup, do not use serialP

The structures there are going away. And speakup has enough troubles
already.

So define a structure similar to what 8250 does: old_serial_port.
There define an array of speed, port base and so on needed for
configuration. Then use this structure instead of serial_state defined
in serialP.h.
