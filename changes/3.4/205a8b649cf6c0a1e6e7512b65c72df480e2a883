ctcm: use correct idal word list for ctcmpc

Communication Server Linux uses the ctcmpc code of the ctcm driver.
Sending problems have shown up caused by a wrong idal word list for
the first ccw. Function ctcmpc_chx_txdone() invokes the function
to prepare the idal word list without setting an appropriate length
for the first ccw, which may lead to an incomplete idal word list.
This patch sets the maximum buffer size as data length of the first
ccw. Thus correct idal word lists are guaranteed in all cases.
