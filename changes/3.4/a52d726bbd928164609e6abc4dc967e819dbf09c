nfsd: convert nfs4_client->cl_cb_flags to a generic flags field

We'll need a way to flag the nfs4_client as already being recorded on
stable storage so that we don't continually upcall. Currently, that's
recorded in the cl_firststate field of the client struct. Using an
entire u32 to store a flag is rather wasteful though.

The cl_cb_flags field is only using 2 bits right now, so repurpose that
to a generic flags field. Rename NFSD4_CLIENT_KILL to
NFSD4_CLIENT_CB_KILL to make it evident that it's part of the callback
flags. Add a mask that we can use for existing checks that look to see
whether any flags are set, so that the new flags don't interfere.

Convert all references to cl_firstate to the NFSD4_CLIENT_STABLE flag,
and add a new NFSD4_CLIENT_RECLAIM_COMPLETE flag.
