ARM: OMAP2+: OPP: allow OPP enumeration to continue if device is not present

On platforms such as OMAP3, certain variants may not have IVA, SGX
or some specific component. We currently have a check to aid fixing
wrong population of OPP entries for issues such as typos. This however
causes a conflict with valid requirement where the SoC variant does
not actually have the module present.

So, reduce the severity of the print to a debug statement and skip
registering that specific OPP, but continue down the list.
