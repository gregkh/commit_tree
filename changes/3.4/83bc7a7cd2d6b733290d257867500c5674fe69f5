staging: ramster: ramster-specific new files

RAMster implements peer-to-peer transcendent memory, allowing a "cluster"
of kernels to dynamically pool their RAM.

This patch adds new files necessary for ramster support:  The file
ramster.h declares externs and some pampd bitfield manipulation.  The
file zcache.h declares some zcache functions that now must be accessed
from the ramster glue code.  The file r2net.c is the glue between zcache
and the messaging layer, providing routines called from zcache that
initiate messages, and routines that handle messages by calling zcache.
TODO explains future plans for merging.
