PCI: add struct pci_host_bridge_window with CPU/bus address offset

Some PCI host bridges apply an address offset, so bus addresses on PCI are
different from CPU addresses.  This patch adds a way for architectures to
tell the PCI core about this offset.  For example:

    LIST_HEAD(resources);
    pci_add_resource_offset(&resources, host->io_space, host->io_offset);
    pci_add_resource_offset(&resources, host->mem_space, host->mem_offset);
    pci_scan_root_bus(parent, bus, ops, sysdata, &resources);
