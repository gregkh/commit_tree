vmscan: only defer compaction for failed order and higher

Currently a failed order-9 (transparent hugepage) compaction can lead to
memory compaction being temporarily disabled for a memory zone.  Even if
we only need compaction for an order 2 allocation, eg.  for jumbo frames
networking.

The fix is relatively straightforward: keep track of the highest order at
which compaction is succeeding, and only defer compaction for orders at
which compaction is failing.
