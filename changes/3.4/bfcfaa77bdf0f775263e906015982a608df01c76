vfs: use 'unsigned long' accesses for dcache name comparison and hashing

Ok, this is hacky, and only works on little-endian machines with goo
unaligned handling.  And even then only with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
disabled, since it can access up to 7 bytes after the pathname.

But it runs like a bat out of hell.
