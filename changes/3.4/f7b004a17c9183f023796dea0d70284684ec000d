ACPICA: Add acpi_os_physical_table_override interface

This interface allows the host to override a table via a
physical address, instead of the logical address required by
acpi_os_table_override. This simplifies the host implementation.
Initial implementation by Thomas Renninger. ACPICA implementation
creates a single function for table overrides that attempts both
a logical and a physical override.
