arm: tegra: dts: Support host/device selection and legacy mode

Some USB ports can support host and device operation. We add the dr_mode
property (as found in Freescale) for this.

One USB port has a 'legacy mode', left over from the days of pre-Tegra
chips. I don't believe this is actually used, except that we must know
to turn this off in the driver.
