perf tools: Fix broken build by defining _GNU_SOURCE in Makefile

When building on my Debian/mips system, util/util.c fails to build
because commit 1aed2671738785e8f5aea663a6fda91aa7ef59b5 (perf kvm: Do
guest-only counting by default) indirectly includes stdio.h before the
feature selection in util.h is done.  This prevents _GNU_SOURCE in
util.h from enabling the declaration of getline(), from now second
inclusion of stdio.h, and the build is broken.

There is another breakage in util/evsel.c caused by include ordering,
but I didn't fully track down the commit that caused it.

The root cause of all this is an inconsistent definition of _GNU_SOURCE,
so I move the definition into the Makefile so that it is passed to all
invocations of the compiler and used uniformly for all system header
files.  All other #define and #undef of _GNU_SOURCE are removed as they
cause conflicts with the definition passed to the compiler.

All the features.h definitions (_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
and _GNU_SOURCE) are needed by the python glue code too, so they are
moved to BASIC_CFLAGS, and the misleading comments about BASIC_CFLAGS
are removed.

This gives me a clean build on x86_64 (fc12) and mips (Debian).
