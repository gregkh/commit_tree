i2c-i801: Use usleep_range to wait for command completion

Use usleep_range instead of msleep when waiting for command
completion. Most SMBus commands complete in less than 2 jiffies so
this brings a pleasant performance boost.

Strongly inspired from a similar change by Olivier Sobrie to the
i2c-isch driver.
