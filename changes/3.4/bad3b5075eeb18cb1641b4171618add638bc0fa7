KVM: PPC: Book3s HV: Maintain separate guest and host views of R and C bits

This allows both the guest and the host to use the referenced (R) and
changed (C) bits in the guest hashed page table.  The guest has a view
of R and C that is maintained in the guest_rpte field of the revmap
entry for the HPTE, and the host has a view that is maintained in the
rmap entry for the associated gfn.

Both view are updated from the guest HPT.  If a bit (R or C) is zero
in either view, it will be initially set to zero in the HPTE (or HPTEs),
until set to 1 by hardware.  When an HPTE is removed for any reason,
the R and C bits from the HPTE are ORed into both views.  We have to
be careful to read the R and C bits from the HPTE after invalidating
it, but before unlocking it, in case of any late updates by the hardware.
