nfsd: vfs_llseek() with 32 or 64 bit offsets (hashes)

Use 32-bit or 64-bit llseek() hashes for directory offsets depending on
the NFS version. NFSv2 gets 32-bit hashes only.

NOTE: This patch got rather complex as Christoph asked to set the
filp->f_mode flag in the open call or immediatly after dentry_open()
in nfsd_open() to avoid races.
Personally I still do not see a reason for that and in my opinion
FMODE_32BITHASH/FMODE_64BITHASH flags could be set nfsd_readdir(), as it
follows directly after nfsd_open() without a chance of races.
