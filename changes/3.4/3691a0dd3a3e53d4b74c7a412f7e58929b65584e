[media] it913x v1.25 support different for remotes

Support for different types of remote.

ITE remotes share common device IDs with differently assigned keys.

Two versions of remote maps have been created there are likely to be more.
v1 for all other IDs
v2 for USB_PID_ITETECH_IT9135_9005.

This patch also separates the configuration parts from it913x_identify_state function.

TODO
