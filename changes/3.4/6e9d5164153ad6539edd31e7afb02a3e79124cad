sysctl: Add support for register sysctl tables with a normal cstring path.

Make __register_sysctl_table the core sysctl registration operation and
make it take a char * string as path.

Now that binary paths have been banished into the real of backwards
compatibility in kernel/binary_sysctl.c where they can be safely
ignored there is no longer a need to use struct ctl_path to represent
path names when registering ctl_tables.

Start the transition to using normal char * strings to represent
pathnames when registering sysctl tables.  Normal strings are easier
to deal with both in the internal sysctl implementation and for
programmers registering sysctl tables.

__register_sysctl_paths is turned into a backwards compatibility wrapper
that converts a ctl_path array into a normal char * string.
