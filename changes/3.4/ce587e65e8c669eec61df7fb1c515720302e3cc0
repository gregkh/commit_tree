mm: memcg: move pc lookup point to commit_charge()

None of the callsites actually need the page_cgroup descriptor
themselves, so just pass the page and do the look up in there.

We already had two bugs (6568d4a 'mm: memcg: update the correct soft
limit tree during migration' and 'memcg: fix Bad page state after
replace_page_cache') where the passed page and pc were not referring
to the same page frame.
