[media] s5p-jpeg: Add JPEG controls support

This patch replaces VIDIOC_S/G_JPEGCOMP ioctl handlers with
V4L2_CID_JPEG_QUALITY control. Additionally it enables JPEG subsampling
and the restart interval configuration through V4L2_CID_JPEG_SUBSAMPLING
and V4L2_CID_JPEG_RESTART_INTERVAL controls. For the decoder video node
only V4L2_CID_JPEG_SUBSAMPLING is available as a read-only control.
