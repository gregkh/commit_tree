x86/PCI: don't fall back to defaults if _CRS has no apertures

Host bridges that lead to things like the Uncore need not have any
I/O port or MMIO apertures.  For example, in this case:

    ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [UNC1] (domain 0000 [bus ff])
    PCI: root bus ff: using default resources
    PCI host bridge to bus 0000:ff
    pci_bus 0000:ff: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0xffff]
    pci_bus 0000:ff: root bus resource [mem 0x00000000-0x3fffffffffff]

we should not pretend those default resources are available on bus ff.
