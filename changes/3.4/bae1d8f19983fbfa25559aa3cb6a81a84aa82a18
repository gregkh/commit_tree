irq_domain/powerpc: Use common irq_domain structure instead of irq_host

This patch drops the powerpc-specific irq_host structures and uses the common
irq_domain strucutres defined in linux/irqdomain.h.  It also fixes all
the users to use the new structure names.

Renaming irq_host to irq_domain has been discussed for a long time, and this
patch is a step in the process of generalizing the powerpc virq code to be
usable by all architecture.

An astute reader will notice that this patch actually removes the irq_host
structure instead of renaming it.  This is because the irq_domain structure
already exists in include/linux/irqdomain.h and has the needed data members.
