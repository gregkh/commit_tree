xfs: split in-core and on-disk inode log item fields

Add a new ili_fields member to the inode log item to isolate the in-memory
flags from the ones that actually go to the log.  This will allow tracking
timestamp-only updates for fdatasync and O_DSYNC in the next patch and
prepares for divorcing the on-disk log format from the in-memory log item
a little further down the road.
