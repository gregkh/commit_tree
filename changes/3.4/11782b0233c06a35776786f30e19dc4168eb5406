drm/i915: consolidate swizzling control bit frobbing

On gen5 we also need to correctly set up swizzling in the display
scanout engine, but only there. Consolidate this into the same
function.

This has a small effect on ums setups - the kernel now also sets this
bit in addition to userspace setting it. Given that this code only
runs when userspace either can't (resume, gpu reset) or explicitly
won't(gem_init) touch the hw this shouldn't have an adverse effect.
