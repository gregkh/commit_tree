ixgbe: Do no clear Tx status bits since eop_desc provides enough info

There isn't any need to clear the status bits in the descriptors due to the
fact that the eop_desc provides enough information for us to know
that we have cleaned to the last packet that the software has put on the
ring.  The status bits are cleared as a part of putting the frame on the
ring so as long as we do not read the descriptor bit prior to reading the
value eop_desc we should be able to guarantee that we will not clean beyond
the end of the current data stream.
