perf tools: fix endianness detection in perf.data

The current version of perf detects whether or not the perf.data file is
written in a different endianness using the attr_size field in the
header of the file. This field represents sizeof(struct perf_event_attr)
as known to perf record. If the sizes do not match, then perf tries the
byte-swapped version. If they match, then the tool assumes a different
endianness.

The issue with the approach is that it assumes the size of
perf_event_attr always has to match between perf record and perf report.
However, the kernel perf_event ABI is extensible.  New fields can be
added to struct perf_event_attr. Consequently, it is not possible to use
attr_size to detect endianness.

This patch takes another approach by using the magic number written at
the beginning of the perf.data file to detect endianness. The magic
number is an eight-byte signature.  It's primary purpose is to identify
(signature) a perf.data file. But it could also be used to encode the
endianness.

The patch introduces a new value for this signature. The key difference
is that the signature is written differently in the file depending on
the endianness. Thus, by comparing the signature from the file with the
tool's own signature it is possible to detect endianness. The new
signature is "PERFILE2".

Backward compatiblity with existing perf.data file is ensured.
