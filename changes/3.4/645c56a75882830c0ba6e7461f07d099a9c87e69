ARM: OMAP2xxx: PM: remove obsolete timer disable code in the suspend path

Remove omap_{read,write}l() from the 24xx PM code.  The clocksource
code should now handle what this was supposed to do.

Tested on N800 -- but it's hard to say whether this fixes anything.
OMAP24xx static suspend path is currently broken, and this patch
doesn't change that.
