pinctrl: add usecount to pins for muxing

Multiple mapping table entries could reference the same pin, and hence
"own" it. This would be unusual now that pinctrl_get() represents a single
state for a client device, but in the future when it represents all known
states for a device, this is quite likely. Implement reference counting
for pin ownership to handle this.
