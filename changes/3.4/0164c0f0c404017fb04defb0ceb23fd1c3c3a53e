KVM: PPC: e500: clear up confusion between host and guest entries

Split out the portions of tlbe_priv that should be associated with host
entries into tlbe_ref.  Base victim selection on the number of hardware
entries, not guest entries.

For TLB1, where one guest entry can be mapped by multiple host entries,
we use the host tlbe_ref for tracking page references.  For the guest
TLB0 entries, we still track it with gtlb_priv, to avoid having to
retranslate if the entry is evicted from the host TLB but not the
guest TLB.
