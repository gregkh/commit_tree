net/hyperv: Adding cancellation to ensure rndis filter is closed

Although the network interface is down, the RX packets number which
could be observed by ifconfig may keep on increasing.

This is because the WORK scheduled in netvsc_set_multicast_list()
may be executed after netvsc_close(). That means the rndis filter
may be re-enabled by do_set_multicast() even if it was closed by
netvsc_close().

By canceling possible WORK before close the rndis filter, the issue
could be never happened.
