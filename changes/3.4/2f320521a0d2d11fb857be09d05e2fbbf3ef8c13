PCI: Make rescan bus increase bridge resource size if needed

Current rescan will not touch bridge MMIO and IO.

Try to reuse pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources(bridge) to update bridge
resources, if child devices need more resources.

Only do that for bridges whose children are all removed already; i.e. don't
release resources that could already be in use by drivers on child devices.
