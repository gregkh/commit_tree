PM / QoS: add pm_qos_update_request_timeout() API

The new API, pm_qos_update_request_timeout() is to provide a timeout
with pm_qos_update_request.

For example, pm_qos_update_request_timeout(req, 100, 1000), means that
QoS request on req with value 100 will be active for 1000 microseconds.
After 1000 microseconds, the QoS request thru req is reset. If there
were another pm_qos_update_request(req, x) during the 1000 us, this
new request with value x will override as this is another request on the
same req handle. A new request on the same req handle will always
override the previous request whether it is the conventional request or
it is the new timeout request.
