ASoC: bf5xx-ssm2602: Set DAI format

Commit 980b0bc69 ("ASoC: blackfin: Use dai_fmt") converted the blackfin ASoC
machine drivers to use the dai_links dai_fmt field to setup their DAI format.
For the bf5xx-ssm2602 the commit removed the manual call to snd_soc_dai_set_fmt,
but missed to set the dai_links dai_fmt field.
