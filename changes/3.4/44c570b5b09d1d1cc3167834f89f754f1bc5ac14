[SCSI] bnx2fc: Handle LOGO flooding from the target

Host drops sessions when flood of unsolicited LOGOs are received from the
target. Because of unsufficient PLOGI retries, upon exceeding the retry count
of 3, the target sessions are dropped. Increased the retry count to 255 to
allow sufficient retries in this scenario.
