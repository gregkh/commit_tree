powerpc/pseries: Cleanup comments in EEH aux components

There're several EEH aux components and the patch does some cleanup
for them so that they look more clean.

        * Duplicated comments have been removed from the header file.
        * Comments have been reorganized so that it looks more clean.
        * The leading comments of functions are adjusted for a little
          bit so that the result of "make pdfdocs" would be more
          unified.
        * Function calls "xxx ()" has been replaced by "xxx()".
