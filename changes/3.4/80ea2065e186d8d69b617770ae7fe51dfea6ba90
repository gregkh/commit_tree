ARM: sa11x0: fix section mismatch warnings

Neponset calls sa1110_mb_disable() from __devinit code, but
sa1110_mb_disable() is marked __init, and so causes a section
mismatch warning.

As sa1110_mb_enable() and sa1110_mb_disable() need to be callable
from suspend/resume paths as well, they must not be marked __init
or __devinit.
