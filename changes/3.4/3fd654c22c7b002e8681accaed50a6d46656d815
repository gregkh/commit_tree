Staging: rts_pstor: off by one in for loop

I already fixed the other similar for loop in this file.  I'm not sure
how I missed this one.  We use seg_no+1 inside the loop so we can't go
right up to the end of the loop.

Also if we don't break out of the loop then we end up past the end of
the array, but with this fix we end up on the last element.
