firewire: move fw_device reference counting from drivers to core

fw_unit device drivers invariably need to talk to the fw_unit's parent
(an fw_device) and grandparent (an fw_card).  firewire-core already
maintains an fw_card reference for the entire lifetime of an fw_device.
Likewise, let firewire-core maintain an fw_device reference for the
entire lifetime of an fw_unit so that fw_unit drivers don't have to.
