rcu: Add CPU-stall capability to rcutorture

Add module parameters to rcutorture that induce a CPU stall.
The stall_cpu parameter specifies how long to stall in seconds,
defaulting to zero, which indicates no stalling is to be undertaken.
The stall_cpu_holdoff parameter specifies how many seconds after
insmod (or boot, if rcutorture is built into the kernel) that this
stall is to start.  The default value for stall_cpu_holdoff is ten
seconds.
