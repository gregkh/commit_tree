ext4: give more helpful error message in ext4_ext_rm_leaf()

The error message produced by the ext4_ext_rm_leaf() when we are
removing blocks which accidentally ends up inside the existing extent,
is not very helpful, because we would like to also know which extent did
we collide with.

This commit changes the error message to get us also the information
about the extent we are colliding with.
