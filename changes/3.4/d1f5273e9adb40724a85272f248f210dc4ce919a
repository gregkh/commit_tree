ext4: return 32/64-bit dir name hash according to usage type

Traditionally ext2/3/4 has returned a 32-bit hash value from llseek()
to appease NFSv2, which can only handle a 32-bit cookie for seekdir()
and telldir().  However, this causes problems if there are 32-bit hash
collisions, since the NFSv2 server can get stuck resending the same
entries from the directory repeatedly.

Allow ext4 to return a full 64-bit hash (both major and minor) for
telldir to decrease the chance of hash collisions.  This still needs
integration on the NFS side.
