checkpatch: add some --strict coding style checks

Argument alignment across multiple lines should match the open
parenthesis.

Logical continuations should be at the end of the previous line, not the
start of a new line.

These are not required by CodingStyle so make the tests active only when
using --strict.

Improved by some examples from Bruce Allen.
