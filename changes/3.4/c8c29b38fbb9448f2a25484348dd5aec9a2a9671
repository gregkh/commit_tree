powerpc/eeh: pseries platform EEH PE address retrieval

There're 2 types of addresses used for EEH operations. The first
one would be BDF (Bus/Device/Function) address which is retrieved
from the reg property of the corresponding FDT node. Another one
is PE address that should be enquired from firmware through RTAS
call on pSeries platform. When issuing EEH operation, the PE address
has precedence over BDF address.

The patch implements retrieving PE address according to the given
BDF address on pSeries platform. Also, the struct eeh_early_enable_info
has been removed since the information can be figured out from
dn->pdn->phb->buid directly and that simplifies the code.
