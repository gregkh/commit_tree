pinctrl: introduce PINCTRL_STATE_DEFAULT, define hogs as that state

This provides a single centralized name for the default state.

Update PIN_MAP_* macros to use this state name, instead of requiring the
user to pass a state name in.

With this change, hog entries in the mapping table are defined as those
with state name PINCTRL_STATE_DEFAULT, i.e. all entries have the same
name. This interacts badly with the nested iteration over mapping table
entries in pinctrl_hog_maps() and pinctrl_hog_map() which would now
attempt to claim each hog mapping table entry multiple times. Replacing
the custom hog code with a simple pinctrl_get()/pinctrl_enable().

Update documentation and mapping tables to use this.
