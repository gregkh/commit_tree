KVM: PPC: booke: Improve timer register emulation

Decrementers are now properly driven by TCR/TSR, and the guest
has full read/write access to these registers.

The decrementer keeps ticking (and setting the TSR bit) regardless of
whether the interrupts are enabled with TCR.

The decrementer stops at zero, rather than going negative.

Decrementers (and FITs, once implemented) are delivered as
level-triggered interrupts -- dequeued when the TSR bit is cleared, not
on delivery.
