drm/nouveau/pm: improve memory timing generation

- Rename several VBIOS entries to closer match the real world
- Add the missing 0x100238 and 0x100240 register values
- Parse bit 14 of the VBIOS timing table
- "Magic value" -> tCWL, fixing some minor bugs in the process
- Also name a few more by their name rather than their number.
- Some values seem to be dependent on the memory type. Fix
