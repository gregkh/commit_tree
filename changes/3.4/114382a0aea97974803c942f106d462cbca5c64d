perf tools: Make perf able to read files from older ABIs

This patches provides a way to handle legacy perf.data
files.  Legacy files are those using the older PERFFILE
signature.

For those, it is still necessary to detect endianness but
without comparing their header->attr_size with the
tool's own version as it may be different. Instead, we use
a reference table for all known sizes from the legacy era.

We try all the combinations for sizes and endianness. If we find
a match, we proceed, otherwise we return: "incompatible file
format".

This is also done for the pipe-mode file format.
