ALSA: echoaudio: Remove incorrect part of assertion

This assertion seems to imply that chip->dsp_code_to_load is a pointer.
It's actually an integer handle on the actual firmware, and 0 has no
special meaning.

The assertion prevents initialisation of a Darla20 card, but would also
affect other models. It seems it was introduced in commit dd7b254d.
