pinctrl: re-order struct pinctrl_map

The lookup key in struct pinctrl_map is (.dev_name, .name). Re-order the
struct definition to put the lookup key fields first, and the result
values afterwards. To me at least, this slightly better reflects the
lookup process.

Update the documentation in a similar fashion.

Note: PIN_MAP*() macros aren't updated; I plan to update this once later
when enhancing the mapping table format to support pin config to reduce
churn.
