powerpc: Make SPARSE_IRQ required

All IRQs on powerpc are managed via irq_domain anyway, there isn't really
any advantage to turning SPARSE_IRQ off, and it's the direction we want
to take the kernel design anyway.  This patch makes powerpc always use
SPARSE_IRQ.

On pseries_defconfig, SPARSE_IRQ adds only about 0x300 bytes to the
.text sections, and removes about 0x20000 from the data section for the
static irq_desc table.
