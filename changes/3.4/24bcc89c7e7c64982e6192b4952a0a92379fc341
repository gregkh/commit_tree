jbd2: split updating of journal superblock and marking journal empty

There are three case of updating journal superblock. In the first case, we want
to mark journal as empty (setting s_sequence to 0), in the second case we want
to update log tail, in the third case we want to update s_errno. Split these
cases into separate functions. It makes the code slightly more straightforward
and later patches will make the distinction even more important.
