ALSA: hda - Remove CD control from model=benq for CX20549

The ID used for detection of the BenQ R55E actually identifies the
Quanta TW3 ODM design, which is also used for the Gigabyte W551 laptop
series. Schematics on the internet clearly indicate that the "Port C"
(analog input connected to record source #4 and mixer input #4) is
unconnected.

Playing an audio CD through analog playback (using cdplay from cdtools)
produces no sound, even with the mixer input labelled "CD" enabled, and
the volume control in the CD drive set to maximum. This indicates the
connection is really not present.
