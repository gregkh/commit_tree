ext4: fix race when setting bitmap_uptodate flag

In ext4_read_{inode,block}_bitmap() we were setting bitmap_uptodate()
before submitting the buffer for read.  The is bad, since we check
bitmap_uptodate() without locking the buffer, and so if another
process is racing with us, it's possible that they will think the
bitmap is uptodate even though the read has not completed yet,
resulting in inodes and blocks potentially getting allocated more than
once if we get really unlucky.
