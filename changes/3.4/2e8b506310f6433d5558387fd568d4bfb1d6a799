    Subject: [PATCH] btusb: add device entry for Broadcom SoftSailing

and noticed it wasn't working on an HP Elitebook.  Looking into the patch I
noticed a very subtle typo in the ids.  The patch has '0x05ac' instead of
'0x0a5c'.  A snippet of the lsusb -v output also shows this:

Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0a5c:21e1 Broadcom Corp.
Device Descriptor:
  bLength                18
  bDescriptorType         1
  bcdUSB               2.00
  bDeviceClass          255 Vendor Specific Class
  bDeviceSubClass         1
  bDeviceProtocol         1
  bMaxPacketSize0        64
  idVendor           0x0a5c Broadcom Corp.
  idProduct          0x21e1
  bcdDevice            1.12
  iManufacturer           1 Broadcom Corp
  iProduct                2 BCM20702A0
  iSerial                 3 60D819F0338C
  bNumConfigurations      1

Looking at other Broadcom ids, the fix matches them whereas the original patch
matches Apple's ids.

Tested on an HP Elitebook 8760w.  The btusb binds and the userspace stuff loads
correctly.
