nfsd4: don't set cl_firststate on first reclaim in 4.1 case

We set cl_firststate when we first decide that a client will be
permitted to reclaim state on next boot.  This happens:

	- for new 4.0 clients, when they confirm their first open
	- for returning 4.0 clients, when they reclaim their first open
	- for 4.1+ clients, when they perform reclaim_complete

We also use cl_firststate to decide whether a reclaim_complete has
already been performed, in the 4.1+ case.

We were setting it on 4.1 open reclaims, which caused spurious
COMPLETE_ALREADY errors on RECLAIM_COMPLETE from an nfs4.1 client with
anything to reclaim.
