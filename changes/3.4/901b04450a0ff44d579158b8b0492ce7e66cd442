x86/numa: Improve internode cache alignment

Currently cache alignment among nodes in the kernel is still 128
bytes on x86 NUMA machines - we got that X86_INTERNODE_CACHE_SHIFT
default from old P4 processors.

But now most modern x86 CPUs use the same size: 64 bytes from L1 to
last level L3. so let's remove the incorrect setting, and directly
use the L1 cache size to do SMP cache line alignment.

This patch saves some memory space on kernel data, and it also
improves the cache locality of kernel data.

The System.map is quite different with/without this change:

	before patch			after patch

  000000000000b000 d tlb_vector_|  000000000000b000 d tlb_vector
  000000000000b080 d cpu_loops_p|  000000000000b040 d cpu_loops_
  ...
