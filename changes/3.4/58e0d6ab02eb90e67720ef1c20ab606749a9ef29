OMAP: N770: remove HWA742 platform data

In an effort to clean up the old omapfb driver, this patch removes
HWA742 (the display chip used in N770) platform data. This can be done
as N770 is the only user of HWA742, and the platform data contains only
one field, te_connected, which we can just presume to be true in the
HWA742 driver.

This allows us to remove omapfb_set_ctrl_platform_data(), and the
mechanism to pass the platform data, in a later patch.
