ACPI: Add interface to register/unregister device to/from power resources

Devices may share same list of power resources in _PR0, for example

Device(Dev0)
{
	Name (_PR0, Package (0x01)
	{
		P0PR,
		P1PR
	})
}

Device(Dev1)
{
	Name (_PR0, Package (0x01)
	{
		P0PR,
		P1PR
	}
}

Assume Dev0 and Dev1 were runtime suspended.
Then Dev0 is resumed first and it goes into D0 state.
But Dev1 is left in D0_Uninitialised state.

This is wrong. In this case, Dev1 must be resumed too.

In order to hand this case, each power resource maintains a list of
devices which relies on it.

When power resource is ON, it will check if the devices on its list
can be resumed. The device can only be resumed when all the power
resouces of its _PR0 are ON.
