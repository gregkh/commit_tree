staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: Advantech PCI-1739U support

This patch is ported over by me (Ian Abbott) from the out-of-tree Comedi
git repository at "git://comedi.org/git/comedi/comedi.git".

The original patch is by Nicholas Nell.

Advantech PCI-1739U support

Hello,

I've added a bit of simple configuration to adv_pci_dio.c in order to
make the PCI-1739U work with the adv_pci_dio driver. I have tested
inputs only so far but they seem to work. A git style patch is
attached.

Thanks,
