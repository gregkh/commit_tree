ARM: OMAP3xxx: clock data: fix DPLL4 CLKSEL masks

Commit 2a9f5a4d455 "OMAP3 clock: remove unnecessary duplicate of dpll4_m2_ck,
added for 36xx" consolidated dpll4 clock structures between 34xx and 36xx,
but left 34xx CLKSEL masks for most dpll4 related clocks, which causes
clock code to not behave correctly when booting on DM3730 with higher
(36xx only) divisors set:
[    0.000000] WARNING: at arch/arm/mach-omap2/clkt_clksel.c:375 omap2_init_clksel_parent+0x104/0x114()
[    0.000000] clock: dpll4_m3_ck: init parent: could not find regval 0
[    0.000000] WARNING: at arch/arm/mach-omap2/clkt_clksel.c:194 omap2_clksel_recalc+0xd4/0xe4()
[    0.000000] clock: Could not find fieldval 0 for clock dpll4_m3_ck parent dpll4_ck

Fix this by switching to 36xx masks, as valid divisors will be limited
by clksel_rate lists.
