powerpc/mpic: Add "last-interrupt-source" property to override hardware

The FreeScale PowerQUICC-III-compatible (mpc85xx/mpc86xx) MPICs do not
correctly report the number of hardware interrupt sources, so software
needs to override the detected value with "256".

To avoid needing to write custom board-specific code to detect that
scenario, allow it to be easily overridden in the device-tree.
