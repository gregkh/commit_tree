x86-64: Improve insn scheduling in SAVE_ARGS_IRQ

In one case, use an address register that was computed earlier (and
with a simpler instruction), thus reducing the risk of a stall.

In the second case, eliminate a branch by using a conditional move (as
is already done in call_softirq and xen_do_hypervisor_callback).
