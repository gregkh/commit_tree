UBI: reduce memory consumption

Remove the pre-allocated 'peb_buf2' buffer because we do not really need it.
The only reason UBI has it is to check that the data were written correctly.
But we do not have to have 2 buffers for this and waste RAM - we can just
compare CRC checksums instead. This reduces UBI memory consumption.
