mtip32xx: fix handling of commands in various scenarios

* If a ncq  command time out and a non-ncq command is active, skip restart port
* Queue(pause) ncq commands during operations spanning more than one non-ncq commands - secure erase, download microcode
* When a non-ncq command is active, allow incoming non-ncq commands to wait instead of failing back
* Changed timeout for download microcode and smart commands
* If the device in write protect mode, fail all writes (do not send to device)
* Set maximum retries to 2
