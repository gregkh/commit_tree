iwlwifi: virtualize command queue full behaviour

When the command queue is full, the transport
will return -ENOSPC, but the reaction to that
depends on the op_mode. Virtualize that, the
DVM op_mode checks for CT-kill and restarts
the hardware otherwise.

We may be able to get rid of this callback by
putting the behaviour check into the wrapper
but that needs more careful evaluation.
