sysctl: fix write access to dmesg_restrict/kptr_restrict

Commit bfdc0b4 adds code to restrict access to dmesg_restrict,
however, it incorrectly alters kptr_restrict rather than
dmesg_restrict.

The original patch from Richard Weinberger
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/14/362) alters dmesg_restrict as
expected, and so the patch seems to have been misapplied.

This adds the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to both dmesg_restrict and
kptr_restrict, since both are sensitive.
