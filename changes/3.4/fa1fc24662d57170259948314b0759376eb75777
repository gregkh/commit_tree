m68knommu: merge common ColdFire QSPI platform setup code

The ColdFire QSPI is common to quite a few ColdFire CPUs. No need to duplicate
its platform setup code for every CPU family member that has it. Merge all the
setup code into a single shared file.

This also results in few platforms no longer needing any local platform
setup code. In those cases remove the empty devices array and initcall
code as well.
