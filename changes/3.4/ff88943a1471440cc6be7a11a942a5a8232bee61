aio: Use __kernel_ulong_t to define aio_context_t

Rather than using "unsigned long" which is ABI-dependent, use
__kernel_ulong_t to define the externally visible type aio_context_t.

Note: the change in this form will cause unsigned long/unsigned int
differences on existing ABIs.  If that is unacceptable we may have to
define a new type.
