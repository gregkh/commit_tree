kgdb,debug-core,gdbstub: Hook the reboot notifier for debugger detach

The gdbstub and kdb should get detached if the system is rebooting.
Calling gdbstub_exit() will set the proper debug core state and send a
message to any debugger that is connected to correctly detach.

An attached debugger will receive the exit code from
include/linux/reboot.h based on SYS_HALT, SYS_REBOOT, etc...
