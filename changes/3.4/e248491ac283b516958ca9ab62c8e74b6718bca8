ftrace: Add enable/disable ftrace_ops control interface

Adding a way to temporarily enable/disable ftrace_ops. The change
follows the same way as 'global' ftrace_ops are done.

Introducing 2 global ftrace_ops - control_ops and ftrace_control_list
which take over all ftrace_ops registered with FTRACE_OPS_FL_CONTROL
flag. In addition new per cpu flag called 'disabled' is also added to
ftrace_ops to provide the control information for each cpu.

When ftrace_ops with FTRACE_OPS_FL_CONTROL is registered, it is
set as disabled for all cpus.

The ftrace_control_list contains all the registered 'control' ftrace_ops.
The control_ops provides function which iterates ftrace_control_list
and does the check for 'disabled' flag on current cpu.

Adding 3 inline functions:
  ftrace_function_local_disable/ftrace_function_local_enable
  - enable/disable the ftrace_ops on current cpu
  ftrace_function_local_disabled
  - get disabled ftrace_ops::disabled value for current cpu
