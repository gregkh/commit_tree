arm/tegra: fix harmony pinmux for PCIe

Commit 6e96aca397 (arm/tegra: Harmony PCIe: Don't touch pinmux)
removed runtime tri-state toggling for PCIe related pinmux groups,
but it seems that the fact that all of them are tri-state by default
has been overlooked. Change defaults for these groups to TEGRA_TRI_NORMAL.
