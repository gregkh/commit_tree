x86: Remove some noise from boot log when starting cpus

Printing the "start_ip" for every secondary cpu is very noisy on a large
system - and doesn't add any value. Drop this message.

Console log before:
Booting Node   0, Processors  #1
smpboot cpu 1: start_ip = 96000
 #2
smpboot cpu 2: start_ip = 96000
 #3
smpboot cpu 3: start_ip = 96000
 #4
smpboot cpu 4: start_ip = 96000
       ...
 #31
smpboot cpu 31: start_ip = 96000
Brought up 32 CPUs

Console log after:
Booting Node   0, Processors  #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 Ok.
Booting Node   1, Processors  #8 #9 #10 #11 #12 #13 #14 #15 Ok.
Booting Node   0, Processors  #16 #17 #18 #19 #20 #21 #22 #23 Ok.
Booting Node   1, Processors  #24 #25 #26 #27 #28 #29 #30 #31
Brought up 32 CPUs
