ath6kl: Support for TCP checksum offload to firmware

The change enables offloading TCP checksum calculation to firmware.
There are still some issues with the checksum offload so better to
disable it by default until the issues are resolved.

To enable TCP checksum offload for tx and rx paths, use
the ethtool as follows:
ethtool -K <interface> tx on
ethtool -K <interface> rx on

To disable TCP checksum offload, for tx and rx paths, use
the ethtool as follows:
ethtool -K <interface> tx off
ethtool -K <interface> rx off
