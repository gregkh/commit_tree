SUNRPC: Fix a few sparse warnings

net/sunrpc/svcsock.c:412:22: warning: incorrect type in assignment
(different address spaces)
 - svc_partial_recvfrom now takes a struct kvec, so the variable
   save_iovbase needs to be an ordinary (void *)

Make a bunch of variables in net/sunrpc/xprtsock.c static

Fix a couple of "warning: symbol 'foo' was not declared. Should it be
static?" reports.

Fix a couple of conflicting function declarations.
