geos: Platform driver for Geos and Geos2 single-board computers.

Trivial platform driver for Traverse Technologies Geos and Geos2
single-board computers. Uses SMBIOS to identify platform.
Based on progressive revisions of the leds-net5501 driver that
was rewritten by Ed Wildgoose as a platform driver.

Supports GPIO-based LEDs (3) and 1 polled button which is
typically used for a soft reset.
