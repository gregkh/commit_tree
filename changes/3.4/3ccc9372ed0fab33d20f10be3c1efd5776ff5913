virtio_balloon: fix handling of PAGE_SIZE != 4k

As reported by David Gibson, current code handles PAGE_SIZE != 4k
completely wrong which can lead to guest memory corruption errors:

- page_to_balloon_pfn is wrong: e.g. on system with 64K page size
 it gives the same pfn value for 16 different pages.

- we also need to convert back to linux pfns when we free.

- for each linux page we need to tell host about multiple balloon
  pages, but code only adds one pfn to the array.

This patch fixes all that, tested with a 64k ppc64 kernel.
