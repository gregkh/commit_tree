mmc: core: Detect card removal on I/O error

To prevent I/O as soon as possible at card removal, a new detect work is
re-scheduled without a delay to let a rescan remove the card device as
soon as possible.

Additionally, MMC_CAP2_DETECT_ON_ERR can now be used to handle "slowly"
removed cards that a scheduled detect work did not detect as removed.
To prevent further I/O requests for these lingering removed cards,
check if card has been removed and then schedule a detect work to
properly remove it.
