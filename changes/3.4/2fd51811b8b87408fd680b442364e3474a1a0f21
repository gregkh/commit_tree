remoteproc: remove unused resource type

RSC_VIRTIO_CFG isn't being used, so remove it.

Originally it was introduced to overcome a resource table limitation
that prevented describing a virtio device in a single resource table
entry.

The plan though is to describe resource table entries in a TLV fashion,
where each entry will consume the amount of space it requires,
so the original limitation is anyway temporary.
