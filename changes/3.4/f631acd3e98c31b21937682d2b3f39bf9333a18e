powerpc/eeh: Replace pci_dn with eeh_dev for EEH core

The original EEH implementation is heavily depending on struct pci_dn.
We have to put EEH related information to pci_dn. Actually, we could
split struct pci_dn so that the EEH sensitive information to form an
individual struct, then EEH looks more independent.

The patch replaces pci_dn with eeh_dev for EEH core.
