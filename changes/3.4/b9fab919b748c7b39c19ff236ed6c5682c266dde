Btrfs: avoid sleeping in verify_parent_transid while atomic

verify_parent_transid needs to lock the extent range to make
sure no IO is underway, and so it can safely clear the
uptodate bits if our checks fail.

But, a few callers are using it with spinlocks held.  Most
of the time, the generation numbers are going to match, and
we don't want to switch to a blocking lock just for the error
case.  This adds an atomic flag to verify_parent_transid,
and changes it to return EAGAIN if it needs to block to
properly verifiy things.
