ARM: add dma coherent region reporting via procfs

Add a new seqfile for reporting coherent DMA allocations.  This contains
the address range, size and the function which was used to allocate
each region, allowing these allocations to be viewed in much the same
way as /proc/vmallocinfo.

The DMA coherent region has limited space, so this allows allocation
failures to be viewed, as well as finding out how much space is being
used.

Make sure this file is only readable by root - same as vmallocinfo - to
prevent information leakage.
