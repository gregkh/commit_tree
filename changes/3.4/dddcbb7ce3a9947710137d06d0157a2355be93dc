kbuild: Fix out-of-tree build for 'make deb-pkg'

The out-of-tree build is broken in 'make deb-pkg'. The
header checks and the header install works on the source and
not on the object tree.
While fixing this also replace the direct 'make' invocations
with the $MAKE variable to be consistent within the script.
