ACPI: Load acpi-cpufreq from processor driver automatically

The only left over hole in automatic cpufreq driver loading was the loading
of ACPI cpufreq. This driver should be loaded when ACPI supports a _PDC
method and the CPU vendor wants to use acpi cpufreq.

Simply add a request module call to the acpi processor core driver
when this is true. This seems like the simplest solution for this.
