[SCSI] libsas: pre-clean commands that won the eh vs completion race

When scrolling forward through the eh list (in a clear_q scenario) it is
possible to encounter commands that won the completion vs eh race.  Rather
than sprinkle more "if (!task)" throughout the handler just make a pass
through the list and delete the race winners before handling the rest.
