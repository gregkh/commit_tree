TTY: ipwireless, fix tty->index handling

* do not test if tty->index is in bounds. It is always.
* tty->index is not a minor! Fix that.

>From now on, let's assume that the parameter of the function is tty
index with base being zero. This makes also the code more readable.

Factually, there is no real change as tty_driver->minor_start is zero,
so the tests are equivalent. But it did not make sense. And if this
had changed eventually, it would have caused troubles.
