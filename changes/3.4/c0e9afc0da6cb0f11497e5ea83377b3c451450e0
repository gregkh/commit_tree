x86: Use -mno-avx when available

On gccs that support AVX it's a good idea to disable that too, similar to
how SSE2, SSE1 etc. are already disabled. This prevents the compiler
from generating AVX ever implicitely.

No failure observed, just from review.

[ hpa: Marking this for urgent and stable, simply because the patch
  will either have absolutely no effect *or* it will avoid potentially
  very hard to debug failures. ]
