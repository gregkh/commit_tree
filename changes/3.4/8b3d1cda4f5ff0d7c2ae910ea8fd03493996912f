posix_types: Remove fd_set macros

<asm/posix_types.h> includes a set of macros that operate on file
descriptors.  Way long ago those were exported to user space, but
nowadays they are #ifdef __KERNEL__.

However, they are nothing but standard (nonatomic) bit operations, and
we already have optimized versions of bit operations in the kernel.
We can't include <linux/bitops.h> in <asm/posix_types.h> but we can
move the definitions to <linux/time.h> and define them there in terms
of standard kernel bitops.

[ v2: folds the following fixes in:

  a) Stray space in __FD_SET(), reported by Andrew Morton
  b) #include <linux/string.h> needed for memset(), reported by Tony Luck ]
