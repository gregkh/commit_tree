gma500, lvds: Fix use after free and mem leak in psb_intel_lvds_init()

In psb_intel_lvds_init(), if we fail to allocate memory for
'psb_intel_connector' we free the memory we previously allocated for
'psb_intel_encoder', but we then proceed to use that free'd pointer
when we do 'psb_intel_encoder->dev_priv = lvds_priv;'.

We may also leak the memory we allocated for 'psb_intel_encoder' if we
'goto failed_connector;' and the variable goes out of scope.

While I was there anyway, I also removed the pointless 'if
(psb_intel_connector)' before freeing it at the 'failed_connector:'
label - kfree() deals gracefully with NULL pointers, so it is not
needed.
