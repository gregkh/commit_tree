Bluetooth: Fix RFCOMM session reference counting issue

There is an imbalance in the rfcomm_session_hold / rfcomm_session_put
operations which causes the following crash:

This issue has been brought up earlier here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/21/127

The issue appears to be the rfcomm_session_put in rfcomm_recv_ua. This
operation doesn't seem be to required as for the non-initiator case we
have the rfcomm_process_rx doing an explicit put and in the initiator
case the last dlc_unlink will drive the reference counter to 0.

There have been several attempts to fix these issue:

6c2718d Bluetooth: Do not call rfcomm_session_put() for RFCOMM UA on closed socket
683d949 Bluetooth: Never deallocate a session when some DLC points to it

but AFAICS they do not fix the issue just make it harder to reproduce.
