ARM: 7361/1: provide XIP_VIRT_ADDR for no-MMU builds

XIP_VIRT_ADDR is needed for XIP builds and currently only defined for
builds with CONFIG_MMU.

Also provide it for no-MMU builds to make it possible to build an XIP
kernel for MMU-less machines. As these lack an MMU it has to be an
identity mapping.
