mtd: nand/fsmc: Add DMA support

The fsmc_nand driver uses cpu to read/write onto the device. This is inefficient
because of two reasons
- the cpu gets locked on AHB bus while reading from NAND
- the cpu is unnecessarily used when dma can do the job

This patch adds the support for accessing the device through DMA
