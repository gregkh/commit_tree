mac80211: rename mesh static path_lookup()

If you want to use mesh support from mac80211 on a recent
kernel on 2.6.24 you'll run into a name clash when compiling
against include/linux/namei.h, so rename this routine.

/home/mcgrof/tmp/compat-wireless-3.2.5-1/net/mac80211/mesh_pathtbl.c: At top level:
/home/mcgrof/tmp/compat-wireless-3.2.5-1/net/mac80211/mesh_pathtbl.c:342:26: error: conflicting types for ‘path_lookup’
include/linux/namei.h:71:12: note: previous declaration of ‘path_lookup’ was here

Although this could sit as a separate patch in compat-wireless it seems
best to just merge upstream.
