ARM: OMAP: clock: cleanup CPUfreq leftovers, fix build errors

Now that we have OPP layer, and OMAP CPUfreq driver is using it, we no
longer need/use the clock framework code for filling up CPUfreq
tables.  Remove it.

Removing this code also eliminates build errors when CPU_FREQ_TABLE
support is not enabled.

Thanks to Russell King for pointing out the parts I missed under
plat-omap in the original version and also pointing out the build
errors when CPUFREQ_TABLE support was not enabled.
