Bluetooth: Update device_connected and device_found events to latest API

This patch updates mgmt_ev_device_connected and mgmt_ev_device found to
include an EIR-encoded remote name and class whenever possible. With
this addition the mgmt_ev_remote_name event becomes unnecessary and can
be removed. Since the connected event doesn't map to hci_conn_complete
anymore a HCI_CONN_MGMT_CONNECTED flag is added to track when mgmt has
been notified about a connection.
