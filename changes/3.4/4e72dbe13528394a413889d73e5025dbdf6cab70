KVM: PPC: Make wakeups work again for Book3S HV guests

When commit f43fdc15fa ("KVM: PPC: booke: Improve timer register
emulation") factored out some code in arch/powerpc/kvm/powerpc.c
into a new helper function, kvm_vcpu_kick(), an error crept in
which causes Book3s HV guest vcpus to stall.  This fixes it.
On POWER7 machines, guest vcpus are grouped together into virtual
CPU cores that share a single waitqueue, so it's important to use
vcpu->arch.wqp rather than &vcpu->wq.
