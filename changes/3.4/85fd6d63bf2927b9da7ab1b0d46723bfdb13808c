ARM: S3C2410: move mach-s3c2410/* into mach-s3c24xx/

This patch moves S3C2410 stuff into mach-s3c24xx/ directory
so that we can merge the s3c24 series' directories to the
just one mach-s3c24xx/ directory.

And this patch is including following.
- re-ordered alphabetically by option text at Kconfig and Makefile
- removed unused option, MACH_N35
- fixed duplcated option name, S3C2410_DMA to S3C24XX_DMA which is
  in plat-s3c24xx/
