tipc: Fix problem with broadcast link synchronization between nodes

Corrects a problem in which a link endpoint that activates as the
result of receiving a RESET/STATE sequence of link protocol messages
fails to properly record the broadcast link status information about
the node to which it is now communicating with. (The problem does
not occur with the more common RESET/ACTIVATE sequence of messages.)
The fix ensures that the broadcast link status info is updated after
the RESET message resets the link endpoint, rather than before, thereby
preventing new information from being overwritten by the reset operation.
