xen/blkback: Fix warning error.

drivers/block/xen-blkback/xenbus.c: In function 'xen_blkbk_discard':
drivers/block/xen-blkback/xenbus.c:419:4: warning: passing argument 1 of 'dev_warn' makes pointer from integer without a cast
+[enabled by default]
include/linux/device.h:894:5: note: expected 'const struct device *' but argument is of type 'long int'

It is unclear how that mistake made it in. It surely is wrong.
