staging: tidspbridge: remove usage of OMAP2_L4_IO_ADDRESS

Instead now use ioremap. This is needed for 3.4 since this change
emerged in mainline during one of the previous rc cycles.

These solves the following compilation breaks:

drivers/staging/tidspbridge/core/tiomap3430.c:
    In function ‘bridge_brd_start’:
drivers/staging/tidspbridge/core/tiomap3430.c:425:4:
    error: implicit declaration of function ‘OMAP2_L4_IO_ADDRESS’

drivers/staging/tidspbridge/core/wdt.c: In function ‘dsp_wdt_init’:
drivers/staging/tidspbridge/core/wdt.c:56:2:
    error: implicit declaration of function ‘OMAP2_L4_IO_ADDRESS’

For control registers a new function needs to be defined so we
can get rid of a layer violation, but that approach must be queued
for the next merge window.
