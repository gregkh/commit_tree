hwmon: (adt7411) fix checkpatch issues

fixed:
WARNING: please, no space before tabs
#11: FILE: adt7411.c:11:
+ * ^I  use power-down mode for suspend?, interrupt handling?$

not fixed as all other macros around it are the same structure and this one is only 2 chars longer:
WARNING: line over 80 characters
#229: FILE: adt7411.c:229:
+static ADT7411_BIT_ATTR(fast_sampling, ADT7411_REG_CFG3, ADT7411_CFG3_ADC_CLK_225);
