x86, memblock: Move mem_hole_size() to .init

mem_hole_size() is being called only from __init-marked functions, and as
such should be moved to .init section as well. Fixes this warning:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x35511): Section mismatch in reference from the function mem_hole_size() to the function .init.text:absent_pages_in_range()
