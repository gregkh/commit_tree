GFS2: Allow caching of rindex glock

This patch allows caching of the rindex glock. We were previously
setting the GL_NOCACHE bit when the glock was released. That forced
the rindex inode to be invalidated, which caused us to re-read
rindex at the next access. However, it caused the glock to be
unnecessarily bounced around the cluster. This patch allows
the glock to remain cached, but it still causes the rindex to be
re-read once it has been written to by gfs2_grow.

Ben and I have tested single-node gfs2_grow cases and I've tested
clustered gfs2_grow cases on my four-node cluster.
