ARM: tegra: uncompress.h: Don't depend on kernel headers

This fixes the following compile error:

  CC      arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.o
In file included from arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:28:0:
arch/arm/mach-tegra/include/mach/uncompress.h: In function 'arch_decomp_setup':
arch/arm/mach-tegra/include/mach/uncompress.h:125:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
cc1: some warnings being treated as errors

This is due to use of the ARRAY_SIZE() macro. Typically, this would be
solved by including <linux/bug.h>, but the compressor code isn't part of
the kernel, and so should not include kernel headers. Instead, define
the few macros the code uses directly, and in a way that doesn't depend
on <linux/bug.h>.
