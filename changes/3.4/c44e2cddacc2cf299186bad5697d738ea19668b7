rcu: Check for idle-loop entry while in RCU read-side critical section

The inner idle loop is an extended quiescent state for all flavors
of RCU, but there have been recent bug involving use of RCU read-side
primitives from within the idle loop.  Therefore, this commit enlists
lockdep-RCU to detect attempts to enter the inner idle loop while in
an RCU read-side critical section, emitting a lockdep-RCU splat if so.
