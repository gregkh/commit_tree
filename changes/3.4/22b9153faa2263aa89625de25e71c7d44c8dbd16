[SCSI] libsas: introduce sas_work to fix sas_drain_work vs sas_queue_work

When requeuing work to a draining workqueue the last work instance may
not be idle, so sas_queue_work() must not touch work->entry.  Introduce
sas_work with a drain_node list_head to have a private list for
collecting work deferred due to drain collision.

Fixes reports like:
  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at           (null)
  IP: [<ffffffff810410d4>] process_one_work+0x2e/0x338
