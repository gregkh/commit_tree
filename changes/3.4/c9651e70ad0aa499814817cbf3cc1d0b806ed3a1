ASPM: Fix pcie devices with non-pcie children

Since 3.2.12 and 3.3, some systems are failing to boot with a BUG_ON.
Some other systems using the pata_jmicron driver fail to boot because no
disks are detected.  Passing pcie_aspm=force on the kernel command line
works around it.

The cause: commit 4949be16822e ("PCI: ignore pre-1.1 ASPM quirking when
ASPM is disabled") changed the behaviour of pcie_aspm_sanity_check() to
always return 0 if aspm is disabled, in order to avoid cases where we
changed ASPM state on pre-PCIe 1.1 devices.

This skipped the secondary function of pcie_aspm_sanity_check which was
to avoid us enabling ASPM on devices that had non-PCIe children, causing
trouble later on.  Move the aspm_disabled check so we continue to honour
that scenario.
