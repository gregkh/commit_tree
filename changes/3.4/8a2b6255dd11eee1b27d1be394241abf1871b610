ARM: fix ioremap/iounmap for !CONFIG_MMU

With commit 4fe7ef3a081 (ARM: provide runtime hook for ioremap/iounmap),
compiles with !CONFIG_MMU were broken. Rename nommu __iounmap to
__arm_iounmap and add arch_ioremap_caller and arch_iounmap. Its
not expected that these need to be overriden for !CONFIG_MMU, so setting
the function ptrs has no effect in this case.
