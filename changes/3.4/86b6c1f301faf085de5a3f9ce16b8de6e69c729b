ptrace: simplify PTRACE_foo constants and PTRACE_SETOPTIONS code

Exchange PT_TRACESYSGOOD and PT_PTRACE_CAP bit positions, which makes
PT_option bits contiguous and therefore makes code in
ptrace_setoptions() much simpler.

Every PTRACE_O_TRACEevent is defined to (1 << PTRACE_EVENT_event)
instead of using explicit numeric constants, to ensure we don't mess up
relationship between bit positions and event ids.

PT_EVENT_FLAG_SHIFT was not particularly useful, PT_OPT_FLAG_SHIFT with
value of PT_EVENT_FLAG_SHIFT-1 is easier to use.

PT_TRACE_MASK constant is nuked, the only its use is replaced by
(PTRACE_O_MASK << PT_OPT_FLAG_SHIFT).
