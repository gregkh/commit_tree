libceph: separate CRC calculation from byte swapping

Calculate CRC in a separate step from rearranging the byte order
of the result, to improve clarity and readability.

Use offsetof() to determine the number of bytes to include in the
CRC calculation.

In read_partial_message(), switch which value gets byte-swapped,
since the just-computed CRC is already likely to be in a register.
