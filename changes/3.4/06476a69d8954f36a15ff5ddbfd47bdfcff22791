ceph: pass inode rather than table to ceph_match_vxattr()

All callers of ceph_match_vxattr() determine what to pass as the
first argument by calling ceph_inode_vxattrs(inode).  Just do that
inside ceph_match_vxattr() itself, changing it to take an inode
rather than the vxattr pointer as its first argument.

Also ensure the function works correctly for an empty table (i.e.,
containing only a terminating null entry).
