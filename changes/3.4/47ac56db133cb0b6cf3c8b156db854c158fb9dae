[SCSI] scsi_error: classify some ILLEGAL_REQUEST sense as a permanent TARGET_ERROR

Permanent target failures are non-retryable and should be classified as
TARGET_ERROR; otherwise dm-multipath will retry an IO request that will
always fail at the target.

A SCSI command that fails with ILLEGAL_REQUEST sense and Additional
sense 0x20, 0x21, 0x24 or 0x26 represents a permanent TARGET_ERROR.
