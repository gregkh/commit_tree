[S390] Ensure that vmcore_info pointer is never accessed directly

Because the vmcore_info pointer is not 8 byte aligned it never should
not be accessed directly. The reason is that the compiler assumes that
64 bit pointer are always double word aligned. To ensure save access,
the vmcore_info type in struct lowcore is changed from u64 to an u8[8]
array and a comment is added.
