batman-adv: add tt_initialised flag to the orig_node struct

(ttvn == 0) is currently used as initial condition. However this is not a good
idea because ttvn gets the vale zero each time after reaching the maximum value
(wrap around). For this reason a new flag is added in order to define whether a
node has an initialised table or not. Moreover, after invoking
tt_global_del_orig(), tt_initialised has to be set to false
