perf hists: Catch and handle out-of-date hist entry maps.

When a process exec()'s, all the maps are retired, but we keep the hist
entries around which hold references to those outdated maps.

If the same library gets mapped in for which we have hist entries, a new
map will be created.  But when we take a perf entry hit within that map,
we'll find the existing hist entry with the older map.

This causes symbol translations to be done incorrectly.  For example,
the perf entry processing will lookup the correct uptodate map entry and
use that to calculate the symbol and DSO relative address.  But later
when we update the histogram we'll translate the address using the
outdated map file instead leading to conditions such as out-of-range
offsets in symbol__inc_addr_samples().

Therefore, update the map of the hist_entry dynamically at lookup/
creation time.
