pinctrl: enhance mapping table to support pin config operations

The pinctrl mapping table can now contain entries to:
* Set the mux function of a pin group
* Apply a set of pin config options to a pin or a group

This allows pinctrl_select_state() to apply pin configs settings as well
as mux settings.

v3: Fix find_pinctrl() to iterate over the correct list.
   s/_MUX_CONFIGS_/_CONFIGS_/ in mapping table macros.
   Fix documentation to use correct mapping table macro.
v2: Added numerous extra PIN_MAP_*() special-case macros.
   Fixed kerneldoc typo. Delete pinctrl_get_pin_id() and
   replace it with pin_get_from_name(). Various minor fixes.
   Updates due to rebase.
