ixgbe: Replace eitr_low and eitr_high with static values in ixgbe_update_itr

There isn't much point in using variables to store the values of eitr_low
and eitr_high since they are not user changeable.  As such I am replacing
them with the constants 10 and 20 in order to avoid any confusion on what
the values actually are.
