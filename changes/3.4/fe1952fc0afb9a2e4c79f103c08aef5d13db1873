powerpc: Rework runlatch code

This moves the inlines into system.h and changes the runlatch
code to use the thread local flags (non-atomic) rather than
the TIF flags (atomic) to keep track of the latch state.

The code to turn it back on in an asynchronous interrupt is
now simplified and partially inlined.
