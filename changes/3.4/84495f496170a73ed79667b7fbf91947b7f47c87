libceph: some simple changes

Nothing too big here.
    - define the size of the buffer used for consuming ignored
      incoming data using a symbolic constant
    - simplify the condition determining whether to unmap the page
      in write_partial_msg_pages(): do it for crc but not if the
      page is the zero page
