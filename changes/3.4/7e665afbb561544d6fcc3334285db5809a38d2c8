qeth: allow change of blkt default values

There exist qeth sysfs blkt attributes to change the default blkt
values. But blkt changes are reset during online setting due to a 2nd
invocation of qeth_determine_capabilites(). This patch makes sure
blkt default values are configured during 1st run of
qeth_determine_capabilities() only. Thus blkt changes are kept
during online setting.
