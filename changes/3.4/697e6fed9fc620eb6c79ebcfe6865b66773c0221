writeback: Remove outdated comment

The comment is hopelessly outdated and misplaced. We no longer have 'bdi'
part of writeback work, the comment about blockdev super is outdated,
comment about throttling as well. Information about list handling is in
more detail at queue_io(). So just move the bit about older_than_this to
close to move_expired_inodes() and remove the rest.
