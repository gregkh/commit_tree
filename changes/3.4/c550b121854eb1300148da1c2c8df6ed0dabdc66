e1000e: use hardware default values for Transmit Control register

This code snippet is simply writing default values to the register which is
unnecessary since the values are programmed into the register by default.
There is a special case for 80003es2lan needing the Retransmit on Late
Collision bit set but that is also done in e1000_init_hw_80003es2lan().
