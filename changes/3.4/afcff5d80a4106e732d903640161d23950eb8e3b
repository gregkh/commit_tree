ext4: remove restrictive checks for EOFBLOCKS_FL

We are going to remove the EOFBLOCKS_FL flag in the future, so this is
the first part of the removal. We can not remove it entirely just now,
since the e2fsck is still checking for it and it might cause headache to
some people. Instead, remove the restrictive checks now and the rest
later, when the new e2fsck code is out and common enough.

This is also needed because punch hole already breaks the EOFBLOCKS_FL
semantics, so it might cause the some troubles. So simply remove it.
