pinctrl: API changes to support multiple states per device

The API model is changed from:

p = pinctrl_get(dev, "state1");
pinctrl_enable(p);
...
pinctrl_disable(p);
pinctrl_put(p);
p = pinctrl_get(dev, "state2");
pinctrl_enable(p);
...
pinctrl_disable(p);
pinctrl_put(p);

to this:

p = pinctrl_get(dev);
s1 = pinctrl_lookup_state(p, "state1");
s2 = pinctrl_lookup_state(p, "state2");
pinctrl_select_state(p, s1);
...
pinctrl_select_state(p, s2);
...
pinctrl_put(p);

This allows devices to directly transition between states without
disabling the pin controller programming and put()/get()ing the
configuration data each time. This model will also better suit pinconf
programming, which doesn't have a concept of "disable".

The special-case hogging feature of pin controllers is re-written to use
the regular APIs instead of special-case code. Hence, the pinmux-hogs
debugfs file is removed; see the top-level pinctrl-handles files for
equivalent data.
