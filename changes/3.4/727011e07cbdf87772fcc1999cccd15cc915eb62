Btrfs: allow metadata blocks larger than the page size

A few years ago the btrfs code to support blocks lager than
the page size was disabled to fix a few corner cases in the
page cache handling.  This fixes the code to properly support
large metadata blocks again.

Since current kernels will crash early and often with larger
metadata blocks, this adds an incompat bit so that older kernels
can't mount it.

This also does away with different blocksizes for nodes and leaves.
You get a single block size for all tree blocks.
