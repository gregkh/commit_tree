libceph: a few small changes

This gathers a number of very minor changes:
    - use %hu when formatting the a socket address's address family
    - null out the ceph_msgr_wq pointer after the queue has been
      destroyed
    - drop a needless cast in ceph_write_space()
    - add a WARN() call in ceph_state_change() in the event an
      unrecognized socket state is encountered
    - rearrange the logic in ceph_con_get() and ceph_con_put() so
      that:
        - the reference counts are only atomically read once
	- the values displayed via dout() calls are known to
	  be meaningful at the time they are formatted
