Staging: bcm: fix possible memory leak of 'pstAddIndication' in CmHost.c and removes a whitespace

Memory is being allocated by kmalloc and stored in
variable pstAddIndication.  However, this memory is
not being freed in all cases. Therefore, this patch
frees it on several exit paths. This patch also
removes a whitespace.
