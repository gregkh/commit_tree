netlink: allow to pass data pointer to netlink_dump_start() callback

This patch allows you to pass a data pointer that can be
accessed from the dump callback.

Netfilter is going to use this patch to provide filtered dumps
to user-space. This is specifically interesting in ctnetlink that
may handle lots of conntrack entries. We can save precious
cycles by skipping the conversion to TLV format of conntrack
entries that are not interesting for user-space.

More specifically, ctnetlink will include one operation to allow
to filter the dumping of conntrack entries by ctmark values.
