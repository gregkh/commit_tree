x86: atomic64 assembly improvements

In the "xchg" implementation, %ebx and %ecx don't need to be copied
into %eax and %edx respectively (this is only necessary when desiring
to only read the stored value).

In the "add_unless" implementation, swapping the use of %ecx and %esi
for passing arguments allows %esi to become an input only (i.e.
permitting the register to be re-used to address the same object
without reload).

In "{add,sub}_return", doing the initial read64 through the passed in
%ecx decreases a register dependency.

In "inc_not_zero", a branch can be eliminated by or-ing together the
two halves of the current (64-bit) value, and code size can be further
reduced by adjusting the arithmetic slightly.

v2: Undo the folding of "xchg" and "set".
