OMAPDSS: HDMI: Move Avi-infoframe struct to hdmi_ip_data

With AVI infoframe various parameters of video stream such as
aspect ratio, quantization range, videocode etc will be indicated
from source to sink.Thus AVI information needs to be set/accessed
by the middle ware based on the video content.
Thus this parameter is now moved to the ip_data structure.
