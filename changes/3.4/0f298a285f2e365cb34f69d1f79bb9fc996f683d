netfilter: ctnetlink: support kernel-space dump filtering by ctmark

This patch adds CTA_MARK_MASK which, together with CTA_MARK, allows
you to selectively send conntrack entries to user-space by
returning those that match mark & mask.

With this, we can save cycles in the building and the parsing of
the entries that may be later on filtered out in user-space by using
the ctmark & mask.
