tile: fix multiple build failures from system.h dismantle

Commit bd119c69239322caafdb64517a806037d0d0c70a

    "Disintegrate asm/system.h for Tile"

created the asm/switch_to.h file, but did not add an include
of it to all its users.

Also, commit b4816afa3986704d1404fc48e931da5135820472

        "Move the asm-generic/system.h xchg() implementation to asm-generic/cmpxchg.h"

introduced the concept of asm/cmpxchg.h but the tile arch
never got one.  Fork the cmpxchg content out of the asm/atomic.h
file to create one.
