KVM: s390: ucontrol: interface to inject faults on a vcpu page table

This patch allows the user to fault in pages on a virtual cpus
address space for user controlled virtual machines. Typically this
is superfluous because userspace can just create a mapping and
let the kernel's page fault logic take are of it. There is one
exception: SIE won't start if the lowcore is not present. Normally
the kernel takes care of this [handle_validity() in
arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c] but since the kernel does not handle
intercepts for user controlled virtual machines, userspace needs to
be able to handle this condition.
