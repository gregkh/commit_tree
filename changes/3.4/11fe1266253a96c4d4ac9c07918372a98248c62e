drm/radeon/kms: reduce probe latency on digital connectors

On a system with one HDMI and one VGA connector the latter
causes output polling to run every ten seconds. This causes
full EDID re-fetch on every poll and approx. 100ms rendering
stalls are experienced by full screen page-flipping applications.
Optimisation is to trust HPD sense on R600+ ASICs and to skip
doing these expensive probes unless HPD sense has changed.
