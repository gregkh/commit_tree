Btrfs: reduce lock contention during extent insertion

We're spending huge amounts of time on lock contention during
end_io processing because we unconditionally assume we are overwriting
an existing extent in the file for each IO.

This checks to see if we are outside i_size, and if so, it uses a
less expensive readonly search of the btree to look for existing
extents.
