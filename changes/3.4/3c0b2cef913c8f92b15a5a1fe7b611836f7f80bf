ARM: OMAP1: Fix pm_idle during suspend

Commit 9ccdac3662dbf3c75e8f8851a214bdf7d365a4bd ([ARM] idle:
clean up pm_idle calling, obey hlt_counter) removed a check
for NULL pm_idle.

Replace the NULL assignment in the OMAP1 code with disable_hlt()
to be in sync with the core code and restore the intended behavior.
