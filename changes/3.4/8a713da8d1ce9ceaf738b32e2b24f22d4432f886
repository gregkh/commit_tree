ASoC: Use regmap update bits operation for drivers using regmap

If a driver is using regmap directly ensure that we're coherent with
non-ASoC register updates by using the regmap API directly to do our
read/modify/write cycles. This will bypass the ASoC cache but drivers
using regmap directly should not be using the ASoC cache.
