    ixgbe: driver fix for link flap

The BIT_APP_UPCHG bit is no longer set when ixgbe_dcbnl_set_all() is
called. This results in the FCoE app user priority never getting set
and the driver will not configure the tx_rings correctly for FCoE
packets which use the SAN MTU and FCoE offloads.

We resolve this regression by fixing ixgbe_copy_dcb_cfg() to also
check for FCoE application changes. Additionally, we can drop the
IEEE variants of get_dcb_app() because this path is never called
with the IEEE mode enabled.
