mac80211: call rate control only after init

There are situations where we don't have the
necessary rate control information yet for
station entries, e.g. when associating. This
currently doesn't really happen due to the
dummy station handling; explicitly disabling
rate control when it's not initialised will
allow us to remove dummy stations.
