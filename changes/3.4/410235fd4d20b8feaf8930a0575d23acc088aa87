TTY: remove unneeded tty->index checks

Checking if tty->index is in bounds is not needed. The tty has the
index set in the initial open. This is done in get_tty_driver. And it
can be only in interval <0,driver->num).

So remove the tests which check exactly this interval. Some are
left untouched as they check against the current backing device count.
(Leaving apart that the check is racy in most of the cases.)
