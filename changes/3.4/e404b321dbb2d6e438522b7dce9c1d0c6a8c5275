tracing: Don't print an extra separator of flags

If __print_flags() is used after another __print_*() function, the
temp seq_file buffer will not be empty on entry, and the delimiter will
be printed even though there's just one field. We get something like:

	|S

instead of just:

	S

This is because the length of the temp seq buffer is used to determine
if the delimiter is printed or not. But this algorithm fails when
the seq buffer is not empty on entry, and the delimiter will be printed
because it thinks that a previous field was already printed.
