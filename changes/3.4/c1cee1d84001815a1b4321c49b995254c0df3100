USB: Microchip VID mislabeled as Hornby VID in ftdi_sio.

Microchip VID (0x04d8) was mislabeled as Hornby VID according to USB-IDs.

A Full Speed USB Demo Board PID (0x000a) was mislabeled as
Hornby Elite (an Digital Command Controller Console for model railways).

Most likely the Hornby based their design on
PIC18F87J50 Full Speed USB Demo Board.
