spi: Trivial warning fix

The loop count i traverses for ntrans which is unsigned
so make the loop count i also unsigned.

Fix the below warning
In file included from drivers/spi/spi-omap2-mcspi.c:38:
include/linux/spi/spi.h: In function 'spi_message_alloc':
include/linux/spi/spi.h:556: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
