firmware_class: Reorganize fw_create_instance()

Recent patches to split up the three phases of request_firmware()
lead to a casting away of const in fw_create_instance(). We can
avoid this cast by splitting up fw_create_instance() a bit.

Make _request_firmware_setup() return a struct fw_priv and use
that struct instead of passing struct firmware to
_request_firmware(). Move the uevent and device file creation
bits to the loading phase and rename the function to
_request_firmware_load() to better reflect its purpose.
