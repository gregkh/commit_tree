AppArmor: Fix dropping of allowed operations that are force audited

The audit permission flag, that specifies an audit message should be
provided when an operation is allowed, was being ignored in some cases.

This is because the auto audit mode (which determines the audit mode from
system flags) was incorrectly assigned the same value as audit mode. The
shared value would result in messages that should be audited going through
a second evaluation as to whether they should be audited based on the
auto audit, resulting in some messages being dropped.
