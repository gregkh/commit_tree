ASoC: dapm: Export mixer|mux_update_power() to public API.

Allow for the operation of custom mixer and mux DAPM widgets that can call
snd_soc_dapm_mixer_update_power() and snd_soc_dapm_mux_update_power() directly
after updating their status. This is useful with complex DAPM Mixer operations
where we need to do additional work in addition to setting a few mixer register
bits.
