gpio/omap: cleanup prepare_for_idle and resume_after_idle

Since *_prepare_for_idle() and *_resume_after_idle() are called
with interrupts disabled they should be kept as simple as possible.
So, moving most of the stuff to *_runtime_suspend/resume() callbacks.

To avoid invalid context restore happening in *_runtime_resume()
callback as a result of *_get_sync() call in *_gpio_probe(), update
bank->context_loss_count. This would make context restore condition
check false in the callback and skip restore until further
initialization take place. The workaround_enabled static variable
is now a member of struct gpio_bank.

Unlike most GPIO registers the OE has 0xffffffff as the default value.
To make sure invalid context is not restored, updating the OE context
with default value.
