dm persistent data: fix btree rebalancing after remove

When we remove an entry from a node we sometimes rebalance with it's
two neighbours.  This wasn't being done correctly; in some cases
entries have to move all the way from the right neighbour to the left
neighbour, or vice versa.  This patch pretty much re-writes the
balancing code to fix it.

This code is barely used currently; only when you delete a thin
device, and then only if you have hundreds of them in the same pool.
Once we have discard support, which removes mappings, this will be used
much more heavily.
