Revert "video:uvesafb: Fix oops that uvesafb try to execute NX-protected page"

This reverts commit ec0d22e4d563e7cce9f6678e2000900755c2989d.

This patch requires exporting 'pcibios_enabled' to avoid breaking
modular uvesafb builds. As this gets some opposition by Alan Cox it
needs more discussion, revert the patch for now.
