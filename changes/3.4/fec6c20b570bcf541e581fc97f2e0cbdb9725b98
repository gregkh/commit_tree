efi: Validate UEFI boot variables

A common flaw in UEFI systems is a refusal to POST triggered by a malformed
boot variable. Once in this state, machines may only be restored by
reflashing their firmware with an external hardware device. While this is
obviously a firmware bug, the serious nature of the outcome suggests that
operating systems should filter their variable writes in order to prevent
a malicious user from rendering the machine unusable.
