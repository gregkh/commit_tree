Staging: bcm: fix CodingStyle warnings/errors reported by checkpatch.pl in led_control.h

This is a patch to the led_control.h file that fixes numerous warnings
and errors reported by the checkpatch.pl tool. There still remain a few
more, but as this is my first attempt at a commit, I'm not going to be
too adventurous!
