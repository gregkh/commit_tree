drm/radeon: fix deferred page-flip detection logic on Avivo-based ASICs

This fixes page-flip-related flickering observed on Iconia Tab W500.

The update_pending status returned by radeon_page_flip is very accurate on
Avivo-based ASICs when vpos is negative.

Experiments were conducted on several ASIC generations ranging from RS690
to Cayman where the page flip was artificially timed to occur at a specific
vpos. With negative vpos, overriding update_pending always lead to
flickering.

The same experiment on RV380 and RV410 showed that update_pending is not
accurate with negative vpos. In most cases update_pending == 1 is returned
although the flip would complete before the start of the next frame.
Therefore I left the behaviour unchanged for pre-AVIVO ASICs for
performance reasons, although this may result in flickering in rare cases.

This change also makes the logic a little easier to understand.
