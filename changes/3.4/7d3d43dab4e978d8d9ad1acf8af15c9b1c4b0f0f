net: In unregister_netdevice_notifier unregister the netdevices.

We already synthesize events in register_netdevice_notifier and synthesizing
events in unregister_netdevice_notifier allows to us remove the need for
special case cleanup code.

This change should be safe as it adds no new cases for existing callers
of unregiser_netdevice_notifier to handle.
