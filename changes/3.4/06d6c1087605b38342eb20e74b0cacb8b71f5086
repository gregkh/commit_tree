netxen: qlogic ethernet : Fix endian bug.

Change the datatype of "ip_addr" to __be32 as 'ip' should be in
big endian format.

Adapter needs "ip address" in big endian format stored at lower 32bit
of req.word[1]. netxen_config_ipaddr() now receives 'ip' in big endian
format. To satisfy adapter's need, use memcpy() to copy byte by byte
of 'ip' into lower 32bit of req.word[1].

Mac address and serial number of adapter need to be in little endian format.
Change the data type of the related  variables to __le32 / __le64 or cast it
explicitly to __le32 / __le64 depending upon the requirement.
