gpio: gpiolib: Support for open drain/collector gpios

Adding support for the open drain gpio on which client
can specify the open drain property through GPIO flag
GPIOF_OPEN_DRAIN at the time of gpio request.
The open drain pins are normally pulled high and it
cannot be driven to output with value of 1 and so
when client request for setting the pin to HIGH, the
gpio will be set to input direction to make pin in tristate
and hence PULL-UP on pins will make the state to HIGH.
The open drain pin can be driven to LOW by setting output
with value of 0.
