xen/acpi: Workaround broken BIOSes exporting non-existing C-states.

We did a similar check for the P-states but did not do it for
the C-states. What we want to do is ignore cases where the DSDT
has definition for sixteen CPUs, but the machine only has eight
CPUs and we get:
xen-acpi-processor: (CX): Hypervisor error (-22) for ACPI CPU14
