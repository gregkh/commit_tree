PCI: Annotate PCI quirks in initcall_debug style

While diagnosing some boot time issues on a platform, all that I
could see in the bootgraph/dmesg was that the system was spending
a lot of time in applying one or more PCI quirks... which
was virtually undebuggable.

This patch adds printk's in "initcall_debug" style to the dmesg,
which are added when the user asks for the initcall_debug
(the nr one tool to use when debugging boot hangs or boot time issues)
kernel command line option.

v2: add #includes so quirks can build on non-x86
