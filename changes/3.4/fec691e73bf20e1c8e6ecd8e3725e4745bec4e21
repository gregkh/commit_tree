ASoC: fsi: PortA/B information was controlled by sh_fsi_port_info

Current FSI got each PortA/B parameter by porta_flags/portb_flags from platform.
And .set_rate function was shared for PortA/B.
This structure was not readable and not flexible.
This patch adds sh_fsi_port_info, and its own settings was added on each platform.
it is preparation for DMAEngine support
