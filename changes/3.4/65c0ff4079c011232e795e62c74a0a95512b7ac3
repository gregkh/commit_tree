x86: Stop recursive fault in print_context_stack after stack overflow

After printing out the first line of a stack backtrace,
print_context_stack() calls print_ftrace_graph_addr() to check
if it's making a graph of function calls, usually not the case.

But unfortunate ordering of assignments causes this to oops if
an earlier stack overflow corrupted threadinfo->task.  Reorder
to avoid that irritation.

( The fact that there was a stack overflow may often be more
  interesting than the stack that can now be shown; but
  integrating that information with this stacktrace is awkward,
  so leave it to overflow reporting. )
