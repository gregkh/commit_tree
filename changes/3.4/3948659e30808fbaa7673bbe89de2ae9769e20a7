xfs: Account log unmount transaction correctly

There have been a few reports of this warning appearing recently:

XFS (dm-4): xlog_space_left: head behind tail
 tail_cycle = 129, tail_bytes = 20163072
 GH   cycle = 129, GH   bytes = 20162880

The common cause appears to be lots of freeze and unfreeze cycles,
and the output from the warnings indicates that we are leaking
around 8 bytes of log space per freeze/unfreeze cycle.

When we freeze the filesystem, we write an unmount record and that
uses xlog_write directly - a special type of transaction,
effectively. What it doesn't do, however, is correctly account for
the log space it uses. The unmount record writes an 8 byte structure
with a special magic number into the log, and the space this
consumes is not accounted for in the log ticket tracking the
operation. Hence we leak 8 bytes every unmount record that is
written.
