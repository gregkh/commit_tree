Btrfs: set page->private to the eb

We spend a lot of time looking up extent buffers from pages when we could just
store the pointer to the eb the page is associated with in page->private.  This
patch does just that, and it makes things a little simpler and reduces a bit of
CPU overhead involved with doing metadata IO.  Thanks,
