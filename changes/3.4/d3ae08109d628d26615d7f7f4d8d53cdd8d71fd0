drm/i915: fix up locking inconsistency around gem_do_init

The locking in our setup and teardown paths is rather arbitrary, but
generally we try to protect gem stuff with dev->struct_mutex. Further,
the ums/gem ioctl to setup gem _does_ take the look. So fix up this
benign inconsistency.

Notice while reading through code.

v2: Rebased on top of the ppgtt code.
