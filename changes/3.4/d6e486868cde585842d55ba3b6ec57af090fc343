debugfs: add mode, uid and gid options

Cautious admins may want to restrict access to debugfs. Currently a
manual chown/chmod e.g. in an init script is needed to achieve that.
Distributions that want to make the mount options configurable need
to add extra config files. By allowing to set the root inode's uid,
gid and mode via mount options no such hacks are needed anymore.
Instead configuration becomes straight forward via fstab.
