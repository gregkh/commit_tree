mmc: cd-gpio: Include header to pickup exported symbol prototypes

Include the linux/mmc/cd-gpio.h header to pickup the prototypes
for the two exported symbols.

This quiets the sparse warnings:

warning: symbol 'mmc_cd_gpio_request' was not declared. Should it be static?
warning: symbol 'mmc_cd_gpio_free' was not declared. Should it be static?
