mtd: harmonize mtd_point interface implementation

Some MTD drivers return -EINVAL if the 'phys' parameter is not NULL, trying to
convey that they cannot return the physical address. However, this is not very
logical because they still can return the virtual address ('virt'). But some
drivers (lpddr) just ignore the 'phys' parameter instead, which is a more
logical thing to do.

Let's harmonize this and:

1. Always initialize 'virt' and 'phys' to 'NULL' in 'mtd_point()'.
2. Do not return an error if the physical address cannot be found.

So as a result, all drivers will set 'phys' to 'NULL' if it is not supported.
None of the 'mtd_point()' users use 'phys' anyway, so this should not break
anything. I guess we could also just delete this parameter later.
