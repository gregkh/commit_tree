xfs: remove xfs_trans_unlocked_item

There is no reason to wake up log space waiters when unlocking inodes or
dquots, and the commit log has no explanation for this function either.

Given that we now have exact log space wakeups everywhere we can assume
the reason for this function was to paper over log space races in earlier
XFS versions.
