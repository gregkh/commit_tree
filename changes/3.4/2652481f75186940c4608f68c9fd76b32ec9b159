powerpc/eeh: pseries platform EEH reset PE

On RTAS compliant pSeries platform, there is a dedicated RTAS call
(ibm,set-slot-reset) to reset the specified PE. Furthermore, two
types of resets are supported: hot and fundamental. the type of
reset is to be used actually depends on the included PCI device's
requirements.

The patch implements resetting PE on pSeries platform through RTAS
call. Besides, it has been abstracted through struct eeh_ops::reset
so that EEH core components could support multiple platforms in future.
