x86: Merge the x86_32 and x86_64 cpu_idle() functions

Both functions are mostly identical.
The differences are:

- x86_32's cpu_idle() makes use of check_pgt_cache(), which is a
  nop on both x86_32 and x86_64.

- x86_64's cpu_idle() uses enter/__exit_idle/(), on x86_32 these
  function are a nop.

- In contrast to x86_32, x86_64 calls rcu_idle_enter/exit() in
  the innermost loop because idle notifications need RCU.
  Calling these function on x86_32 also in the innermost loop
  does not hurt.

So we can merge both functions.
