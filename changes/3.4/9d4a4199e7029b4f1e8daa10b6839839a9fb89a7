ARM: OMAP2+: board-omap4-*: Do not use anymore TWL6030_IRQ_BASE in board files

With the introduction of dynamically allocated IRQ in the twl6030 driver,
the board files can no longer rely of static IRQ defines like before.

Retrieve the value dynamically allocated from the mmc -> twl6030 init
callback.

Note: The Panda board does not seems to use the card detect IRQ.
