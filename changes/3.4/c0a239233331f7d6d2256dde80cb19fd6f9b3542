cs5535-clockevt: Allow the MFGPT IRQ to be shared

Shared timer IRQs are not a good solution, however the Geode platform has
no APIC, IRQs are a scarce resource and there is no technical reason to
forbid it rightaway.  Increased latencies and overhead due to sharing are
still better than a driver refusing to load.
