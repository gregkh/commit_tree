PM / Sleep: Make __pm_stay_awake() delete wakeup source timers

If __pm_stay_awake() is called after __pm_wakeup_event() for the same
wakep source object before its timer expires, it won't cancel the
timer, so the wakeup source will be deactivated from the timer
function as scheduled by __pm_wakeup_event().  In that case
__pm_stay_awake() doesn't have any effect beyond incrementing
the wakeup source's event_count field, although it should cancel
the timer and make the wakeup source stay active until __pm_relax()
is called for it.

To fix this problem make __pm_stay_awake() delete the wakeup source's
timer and ensure that it won't be deactivated from the timer funtion
afterwards by clearing its timer_expires field.
