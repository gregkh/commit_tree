ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: clean up init data section assignments

The main purpose of this patch is to fix several section mismatch
warnings from the board file and a few board specific drivers,
introduced with recent Amstrad Delta patch series, some of them rising
up only when building with CONFIG_MODULES not set.

While being at it, section tagging of all init data found in the board
file have been revised and hopefully corrected and/or optimized.
