md/bitmap: ensure to load bitmap when creating via sysfs.

When commit 69e51b449d383e (md/bitmap:  separate out loading a bitmap...)
created bitmap_load, it missed calling it after bitmap_create when a
bitmap is created through the sysfs interface.
So if a bitmap is added this way, we don't allocate memory properly
and can crash.

This is suitable for any -stable release since 2.6.35.
