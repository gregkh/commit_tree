ARM: provide runtime hook for ioremap/iounmap

We have compile time over-ride of ioremap and iounmap, but an run-time
override is needed for multi-platform builds. This adds an extra function
pointer check, but ioremap is not peformance critical. The option for
compile time selection remains.

The caller variant is used here to provide correct caller information as
ARM can only support level 0 for __builtin_return_address.
