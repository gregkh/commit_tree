ixgbe: Address issues with Tx WHTRESH value not being set correctly

This change is meant to address the fact that the tx_itr_setting was
dropping to 0 when no separate Tx vectors were provided.  This had resulted
in the driver incorrectly configuring the Tx ring with a WTHRESH of 1 in
order to avoid Tx hangs even though that was not necessary. This change
makes it so that we instead take a look at the Tx ring's q_vector to
determine if the ring will have an ITR value less than 8us.
