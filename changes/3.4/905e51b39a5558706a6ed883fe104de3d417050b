dm thin: commit outstanding data every second

Commit unwritten data every second to prevent too much building up.

Released blocks don't become available until after the next commit
(for crash resilience).  Prior to this patch commits were only
triggered by a message to the target or a REQ_{FLUSH,FUA} bio.  This
allowed far too big a position to build up.

The interval is hard-coded to 1 second.  This is a sensible setting.
I'm not making this user configurable, since there isn't much to be
gained by tweaking this - and a lot lost by setting it far too high.
