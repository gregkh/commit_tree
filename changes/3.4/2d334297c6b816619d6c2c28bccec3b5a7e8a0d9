ARM: ux500: Initial Device Tree support for Snowball

This provides very basic Device Tree support for ST-Ericsson's
low-cost development platform, Snowball. If Device Tree for
ux500 is enabled and the correct board is configured within the
Device Tree blob, the correct *_init_machine() will be called.

This patch is based on some original work completed by:
