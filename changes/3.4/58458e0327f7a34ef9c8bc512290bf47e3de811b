ARM: imx6q: convert to twd_local_timer_register() interface

Add support for the new smp_twd runtime registration interface
to the imx6q platforms, and remove the old compile-time support.

The imx6q DTS file is updated to match the TWD DT documentation.
Also present in this patch a DTS fix to the timer interrupt routing
(the PPI connection uses bits [15:8]) and trigger (rising edge).
