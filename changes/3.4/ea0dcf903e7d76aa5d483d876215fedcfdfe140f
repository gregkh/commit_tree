x86/apic: Use x2apic physical mode based on FADT setting

Provide systems that do not support x2apic cluster mode
a mechanism to select x2apic physical mode using the
FADT FORCE_APIC_PHYSICAL_DESTINATION_MODE bit.

Changes from v1: (based on Suresh's comments)
 - removed #ifdef CONFIG_ACPI
 - removed #include <linux/acpi.h>
