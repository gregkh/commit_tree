USB: sa1111: reorganize ohci-sa1111.c

Combine usb_hcd_sa1111_probe() and ohci_hcd_sa1111_drv_probe(), doing
the same for the remove methods.

Move sa1111_start_hc and sa1111_stop_hc to be located next to these
the probe/release functions, as they're only called from them.

Get rid of the /*----*/ breaker lines.
