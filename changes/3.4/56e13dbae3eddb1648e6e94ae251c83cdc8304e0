KVM: PPC: Fix PR KVM on POWER7 bare metal

When running on a system that is HV capable, some interrupts use HSRR
SPRs instead of the normal SRR SPRs. These are also used in the Linux
handlers to jump back to code after an interrupt got processed.

Unfortunately, in our "jump back to the real host handler after we've
done the context switch" code, we were only setting the SRR SPRs,
rendering Linux to jump back to some invalid IP after it's processed
the interrupt.

This fixes random crashes on p7 opal mode with PR KVM for me.
