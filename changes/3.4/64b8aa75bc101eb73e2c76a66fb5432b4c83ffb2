[SCSI] bfa: don't leak mem in bfad_im_bsg_els_ct_request()

If 'drv_fcxp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct bfad_fcxp), GFP_KERNEL);' fails
and returns NULL, then we'll leak the memory allocated to 'bsg_fcpt'
when we jump to 'out:' and the variable subsequently goes out of
scope.

Also remove the cast of the kzalloc() return value. kzalloc() returns
a void* which is implicitly converted, so the explicit cast is
pointless.
