drm/i915: catch gtfifo errors on forcewake_put

This is similar to a patch I wrote several months ago. It's been updated
for the new FORCEWAKE_MT. As recommended by Chris Wilson, use WARN()
instead of DRM_ERROR, so we can get a backtrace.

This shouldn't impact performance too much as the extra register read
can replace the POSTING_READ we had previously.
