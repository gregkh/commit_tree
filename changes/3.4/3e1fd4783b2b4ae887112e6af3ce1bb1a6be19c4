[media] fintek-cir: change || to &&

The current condition is always true, so everything uses
LOGICAL_DEV_CIR_REV2 (8).  It should be that Fintek products
0x0408(F71809) and 0x0804(F71855) use logical device
LOGICAL_DEV_CIR_REV1 (5) and other chip ids use logical device 8.

In other words, this fixes hardware detection for 0x0408 and 0x0804.
