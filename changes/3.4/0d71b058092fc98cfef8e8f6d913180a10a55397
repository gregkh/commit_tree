NFS: Extend the -overs= mount option to allow 4.x minorversions

Allow the user to mount an NFSv4.0 or NFSv4.1 partition using a
standard syntax of '-overs=4.0', or '-overs=4.1' rather than the
more cumbersome '-overs=4,minorversion=1'.

See also the earlier patch by Dros Adamson, which added the
Linux-specific syntax '-ov4.0', '-ov4.1'.
