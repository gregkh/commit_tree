swap: don't do discard if no discard option added

When swapon() was not passed the SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD option, sys_swapon()
will still perform a discard operation.  This can cause problems if
discard is slow or buggy.

Reverse the order of the check so that a discard operation is performed
only if the sys_swapon() caller is attempting to enable discard.
