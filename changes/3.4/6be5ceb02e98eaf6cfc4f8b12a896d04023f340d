VM: add "vm_mmap()" helper function

This continues the theme started with vm_brk() and vm_munmap():
vm_mmap() does the same thing as do_mmap(), but additionally does the
required VM locking.

This uninlines (and rewrites it to be clearer) do_mmap(), which sadly
duplicates it in mm/mmap.c and mm/nommu.c.  But that way we don't have
to export our internal do_mmap_pgoff() function.

Some day we hopefully don't have to export do_mmap() either, if all
modular users can become the simpler vm_mmap() instead.  We're actually
very close to that already, with the notable exception of the (broken)
use in i810, and a couple of stragglers in binfmt_elf.
