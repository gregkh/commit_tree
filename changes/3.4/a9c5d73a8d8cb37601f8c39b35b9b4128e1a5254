Lockd: pernet usage counter introduced

Lockd is going to be shared between network namespaces - i.e. going to be able
to handle lock requests from different network namespaces. This means, that
network namespace related resources have to be allocated not once (like now),
but for every network namespace context, from which service is requested to
operate.
This patch implements Lockd per-net users accounting. New per-net counter is
used to determine, when per-net resources have to be freed.
