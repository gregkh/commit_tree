memcg: fix Bad page state after replace_page_cache

My 9ce70c0240d0 "memcg: fix deadlock by inverting lrucare nesting" put a
nasty little bug into v3.3's version of mem_cgroup_replace_page_cache(),
sometimes used for FUSE.  Replacing __mem_cgroup_commit_charge_lrucare()
by __mem_cgroup_commit_charge(), I used the "pc" pointer set up earlier:
but it's for oldpage, and needs now to be for newpage.  Once oldpage was
freed, its PageCgroupUsed bit (cleared above but set again here) caused
"Bad page state" messages - and perhaps worse, being missed from newpage.
(I didn't find this by using FUSE, but in reusing the function for tmpfs.)
