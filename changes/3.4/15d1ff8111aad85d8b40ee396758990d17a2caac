Btrfs: fix deadlock during allocating chunks

This deadlock comes from xfstests 251.

We'll hold the chunk_mutex throughout the whole of a chunk allocation.
But if we find that we've used up system chunk space, we need to allocate a
new system chunk, but this will lead to a recursion of chunk allocation and end
up with a deadlock on chunk_mutex.
So instead we need to allocate the system chunk first if we find we're in ENOSPC.
