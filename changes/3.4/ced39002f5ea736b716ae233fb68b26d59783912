ftrace, perf: Add support to use function tracepoint in perf

Adding perf registration support for the ftrace function event,
so it is now possible to register it via perf interface.

The perf_event struct statically contains ftrace_ops as a handle
for function tracer. The function tracer is registered/unregistered
in open/close actions.

To be efficient, we enable/disable ftrace_ops each time the traced
process is scheduled in/out (via TRACE_REG_PERF_(ADD|DELL) handlers).
This way tracing is enabled only when the process is running.
Intentionally using this way instead of the event's hw state
PERF_HES_STOPPED, which would not disable the ftrace_ops.

It is now possible to use function trace within perf commands
like:

  perf record -e ftrace:function ls
  perf stat -e ftrace:function ls

Allowed only for root.
