xen/xenbus: Add quirk to deal with misconfigured backends.

A rather annoying and common case is when booting a PVonHVM guest
and exposing the PV KBD and PV VFB - as broken toolstacks don't
always initialize the backends correctly.

Normally The HVM guest is using the VGA driver and the emulated
keyboard for this (though upstream version of QEMU implements
PV KBD, but still uses a VGA driver). We provide a very basic
two-stage wait mechanism - where we wait for 30 seconds for all
devices, and then for 270 for all them except the two mentioned.

That allows us to wait for the essential devices, like network
or disk for the full 6 minutes.

To trigger this, put this in your guest config:

vfb = [ 'vnc=1, vnclisten=0.0.0.0 ,vncunused=1']

instead of this:
vnc=1
vnclisten="0.0.0.0"
