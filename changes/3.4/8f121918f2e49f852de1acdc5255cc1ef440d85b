cgroup: cgroup_attach_task() could return -errno after success

61d1d219c4 "cgroup: remove extra calls to find_existing_css_set" made
cgroup_task_migrate() return void.  An unfortunate side effect was
that cgroup_attach_task() was depending on that function's return
value to clear its @retval on the success path.  On cgroup mounts
without any subsystem with ->can_attach() callback,
cgroup_attach_task() ended up returning @retval without initializing
it on success.

For some reason, gcc failed to warn about it and it didn't cause
cgroup_attach_task() to return non-zero value in many cases, probably
due to difference in register allocation.  When the problem
materializes, systemd fails to populate /systemd cgroup mount and
fails to boot.

Fix it by initializing @retval to zero on declaration.
