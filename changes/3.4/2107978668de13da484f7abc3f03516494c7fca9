rbd: a few small cleanups

Some minor cleanups in "drivers/block/rbd.c:
    - Use the more meaningful "RBD_MAX_OBJ_NAME_LEN" in place if "96"
      in the definition of RBD_MAX_MD_NAME_LEN.
    - Use DEFINE_SPINLOCK() to define and initialize node_lock.
    - Drop a needless (char *) cast in parse_rbd_opts_token().
    - Make a few minor formatting changes.
