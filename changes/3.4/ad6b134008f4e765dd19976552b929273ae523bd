SUNRPC: fix pipe->ops cleanup on pipe dentry unlink

This patch looks late due to GSS AUTH patches sent already. But it fixes a flaw
in RPC PipeFS pipes handling.
I've added this patch in the series, because this series related to pipes. But
it should be a part of previous series named "SUNPRC: cleanup PipeFS for
network-namespace-aware users".

Pipe dentry can be created and destroyed many times during pipe life cycle.
This actually means, that we can't set pipe->ops to NULL in rpc_close_pipes()
and use this variable as a flag, indicating, that pipe's dentry is unlinking.
To follow this restriction, this patch replaces "pipe->ops = NULL" assignment
and checks for NULL with "pipe->dentry = NULL" assignment and checks for
NULL respectively.
This patch also removes check for non-NULL pipe->ops (or pipe->dentry) in
rpc_close_pipes() because it always non-NULL now.
