watchdog: watchdog_dev: Let the driver update the timeout field on set_timeout success

When a set_timeout operation succeeds this does not necessarily mean that
the exact timeout requested has been achieved, because the watchdog does not
necessarily have a 1 second resolution. So rather then have the core set
the timeout member of the watchdog_device struct to the exact requested
value, instead the driver should set it to the actually achieved timeout value.
