cpufreq: OMAP: fix build errors: depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS

The OMAP driver needs a 'depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS' since it only
builds for OMAP2+ platforms.

This 'depends on' was in the original patch from Russell King, but was
erroneously removed by me when making this option user-selectable in
commit b09db45c (cpufreq: OMAP driver depends CPUfreq tables.)  This
patch remedies that.

Apologies to Russell King for breaking his originally working patch.

Also, thanks to Grazvydas Ignotas for reporting the same problem.
