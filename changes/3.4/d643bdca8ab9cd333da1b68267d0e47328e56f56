asm-generic: Allow overriding clock_t and add attributes to siginfo_t

For the particular issue of x32, which shares code with i386 in the
handling of compat_siginfo_t, the use of a 64-bit clock_t bumps the
sigchld structure out of alignment, which triggers a messy cascade of
padding.

This was already handled on the kernel compat side, but it needs
handling on the user space side, which uses the generic header.  To
make that possible:

1. Allow __kernel_clock_t to be overridden in struct siginfo;
2. Allow there to be attributes added to struct siginfo.
