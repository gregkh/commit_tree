cpupower tool: allow to build in a separate directory

This patch allows cpupower tool to generate its output files in a
seperate directory. This is now possible by passing the 'O=<path>' to
the command line.

This can be usefull for a normal user if the kernel source code is
located in a read only location.

This is patch stole some bits of the perf makefile.
