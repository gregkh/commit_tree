ixgbe: Add module parameter to allow untested and unsafe SFP+ modules

The X520 family of network devices, with the 82599 chip, support a
small number of Intel-verified SFP+ modules on their NICs.  To maintain
stability and quality, the current devices restrict untested 3rd party
SFP+ modules.

This patch introduces a module parameter for ixgbe to allow these untested
modules at the user's peril.  It also includes a warning to the syslog
alerting users that the modules aren't supported, and results may
vary.
