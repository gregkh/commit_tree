gpio: gpiolib: Support for open source/emitter gpios

Adding support for the open source gpio on which client
can specify the open source property through GPIO flag
GPIOF_OPEN_SOURCE at the time of gpio request.
The open source pins are normally pulled low and it
cannot be driven to output with value of 0 and so
when client request for setting the pin to LOW, the
gpio will be set to input direction to make pin in tristate
and hence PULL-DOWN on pins will make the state to LOW.
The open source pin can be driven to HIGH by setting output
with value of 1.
