libceph: rename "page_shift" variable to something sensible

In write_partial_msg_pages() there is a local variable used to
track the starting offset within a bio segment to use.  Its name,
"page_shift" defies the Linux convention of using that name for
log-base-2(page size).

Since it's only used in the bio case rename it "bio_offset".  Use it
along with the page_pos field to compute the memory offset when
computing CRC's in that function.  This makes the bio case match the
others more closely.
