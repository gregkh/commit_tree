mtd: ixp4xx: oops in ixp4xx_flash_probe

In commit "c797533 mtd: abstract last MTD partition parser argument" the
third argument of "mtd_device_parse_register()" changed from start address
of the MTD device to a pointer to a struct.

The "ixp4xx_flash_probe()" function was not converted properly, causing
an oops during boot.

This patch fixes the problem by filling the needed information into a
"struct mtd_part_parser_data" and passing it to
"mtd_device_parse_register()".
