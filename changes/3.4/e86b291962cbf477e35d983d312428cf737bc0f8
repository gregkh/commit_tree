tcp: introduce tcp_data_queue_ofo

Split tcp_data_queue() in two parts for better readability.

tcp_data_queue_ofo() is responsible for queueing incoming skb into out
of order queue.

Change code layout so that the skb_set_owner_r() is performed only if
skb is not dropped.

This is a preliminary patch before "reduce out_of_order memory use"
following patch.
