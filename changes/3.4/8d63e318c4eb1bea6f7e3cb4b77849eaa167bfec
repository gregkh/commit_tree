libceph: isolate kmap() call in write_partial_msg_pages()

In write_partial_msg_pages(), every case now does an identical call
to kmap(page).  Instead, just call it once inside the CRC-computing
block where it's needed.  Move the definition of kaddr inside that
block, and make it a (char *) to ensure portable pointer arithmetic.

We still don't kunmap() it until after the sendpage() call, in case
that also ends up needing to use the mapping.
