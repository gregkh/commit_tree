bnx2x: Lock PF-common resources

Use hardware locks to protect resources common to several Physical Functions. In
a virtualized environment the RTNL lock only protects a PF's driver against
the PFs sharing it's VMs with regard to device resources. Other PFs may reside
in other VMs under other OSs, and are not subject to the lock. Such resources
which were previously protected implicitly by the RTNL lock must now be
protected explicitly with dedicated HW locks.
