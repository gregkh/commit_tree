This reverts commit 9f85550347f51c79a917b2aec04c90691c11e20a.

Peter Zijlstra says:
| Argh, how did that ever make it upstream, please drop.
|
| Russell, please make that go away upstream.
|
| Like I said, this is both completely the wrong way to solve, and you're
| so not paying attention, see:
|
|   5fbd036b552f633abb394a319f7c62a5c86a9cd7
|   2baab4e90495ebc9826c93f79d74d6e60a828d24
|   e3831edd59edf57ca11fc289f08961b20baf5146
|
| What's even worse:
|
| git describe --contains 9f85550347f51c79a917b2aec04c90691c11e20a --match "v*"
| v3.4-rc3~1^2~3
|
| that nonsense got merged long after those other commits.

Linus Walleij says:
| My bad, was because the initial patch was submitted march 9th before
| these fixes were merged:
| http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=133159655513844&w=2
|
| It was pending for a while in Russell's patch tracker and I
| rebased it to -rc2 without paying enough attention to recent
| related scheduler fixes ... lesson learned.
