md/bitmap: fix calculation of 'chunks' - missing shift.

commit 61a0d80c "md/bitmap: discard CHUNK_BLOCK_SHIFT macro"
replaced CHUNK_BLOCK_RATIO() by the same text that was
replacing CHUNK_BLOCK_SHIFT() - which is clearly wrong.

The result is that 'chunks' is often too small by 1,
which can sometimes result in a crash (not sure how).

So use the correct replacement, and get rid of CHUNK_BLOCK_RATIO
which is no longe used.
