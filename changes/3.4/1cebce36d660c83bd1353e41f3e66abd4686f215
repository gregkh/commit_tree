tcp: fix infinite cwnd in tcp_complete_cwr()

When the cwnd reduction is done, ssthresh may be infinite
if TCP enters CWR via ECN or F-RTO. If cwnd is not undone, i.e.,
undo_marker is set, tcp_complete_cwr() falsely set cwnd to the
infinite ssthresh value. The correct operation is to keep cwnd
intact because it has been updated in ECN or F-RTO.
