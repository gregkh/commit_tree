KVM: PPC: Add an interface for pinning guest pages in Book3s HV guests

This adds two new functions, kvmppc_pin_guest_page() and
kvmppc_unpin_guest_page(), and uses them to pin the guest pages where
the guest has registered areas of memory for the hypervisor to update,
(i.e. the per-cpu virtual processor areas, SLB shadow buffers and
dispatch trace logs) and then unpin them when they are no longer
required.

Although it is not strictly necessary to pin the pages at this point,
since all guest pages are already pinned, later commits in this series
will mean that guest pages aren't all pinned.
