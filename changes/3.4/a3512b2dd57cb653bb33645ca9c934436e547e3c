powerpc/irq: Make alignment & program interrupt behave the same

Alignment was the last user of the ENABLE_INTS macro, which we can
now remove. All non-syscall exceptions now disable interrupts on
entry, they get re-enabled conditionally from C code. Don't
unconditionally re-enable in program check either, check the
original context.
