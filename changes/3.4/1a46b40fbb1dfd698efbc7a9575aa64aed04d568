e1000e: cleanup: rename e1000e_setup_link() and call as function pointer

Rename e1000e_setup_link() to e1000e_setup_link_generic() to signify the
function is used for more than one MAC-family type.  The 82571-family has
a custom setup_link function which also calls the generic function.  The
ich8lan-family has a custom function which should just be called via the
function pointer.  The 80003es2lan-family just uses the generic function.
