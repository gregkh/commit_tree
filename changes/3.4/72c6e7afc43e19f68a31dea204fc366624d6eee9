dm crypt: add missing error handling

Always set io->error to -EIO when an error is detected in dm-crypt.

There were cases where an error code would be set only if we finish
processing the last sector. If there were other encryption operations in
flight, the error would be ignored and bio would be returned with
success as if no error happened.

This bug is present in kcryptd_crypt_write_convert, kcryptd_crypt_read_convert
and kcryptd_async_done.
