ARM: 7366/3: amba: Remove AMBA level regulator support

The AMBA bus regulator support is being used to model on/off switches
for power domains which isn't terribly idiomatic for modern kernels with
the generic power domain code and creates integration problems on platforms
which don't use regulators for their power domains as it's hard to tell
the difference between a regulator that is needed but failed to be provided
and one that isn't supposed to be there (though DT does make that easier).

Platforms that wish to use the regulator API to manage their power domains
can indirect via the power domain interface.

This feature is only used with the vape supply of the db8500 PRCMU
driver which supplies the UARTs and MMC controllers, none of which have
support for managing vcore at runtime in mainline (only pl022 SPI
controller does).  Update that supply to have an always_on constraint
until the power domain support for the system is updated so that it is
enabled for these users, this is likely to have no impact on practical
systems as probably at least one of these devices will be active and
cause AMBA to hold the supply on anyway.
