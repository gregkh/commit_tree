tipc: Fix bug in broadcast link duplicate message statistics

Modifies broadcast link so that it increments the "received duplicate
message" count if an incoming message cannot be added to the deferred
message queue because it is already present in the queue. (The aligns
broadcast link behavior with that of TIPC's unicast links.)
