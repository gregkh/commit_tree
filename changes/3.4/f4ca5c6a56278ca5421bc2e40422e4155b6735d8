PCI: Add class support in quirk handling

Recently added support to allow quirks to report duration also make the
boot log very crowded when initcall_debug is specified.

One thing we can to do mitigate this is to not call quirks unnecessarily
by adding a new quirk declaration macro that takes a class argument.

The new macro takes a class value and a class shift value (since it can
vary) so that quirks will be limited to certain device classes, greatly
reducing the number we call on every PCI device addition.

-v2: fix v1 that left over of sparated patch.
-v3: according to Jesse, change cls to class, cls_shift, to class_shift.
