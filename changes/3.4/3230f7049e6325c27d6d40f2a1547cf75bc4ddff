hwmon: (hwmon-vid) Add new entries to VRM model table

The VRM model table was missing several Intel CPUs, resulting in wrong VRM table
entries to be used for many recent CPUs. Update it. Also, use values from
struct cpuinfo_x86 to retrieve CPU model information instead of re-calculating
it locally.
