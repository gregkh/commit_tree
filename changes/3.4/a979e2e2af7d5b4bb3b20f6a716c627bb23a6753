samsung-laptop: unregister ACPI video module for some well known laptops

On these laptops, the ACPI video is not functional, and very unlikely
to be fixed by the vendor. Note that intel_backlight works for some
of these laptops, and the backlight from samsung-laptop always work.

The good news is that newer laptops have functional ACPI video device
and won't end up growing this list.
