[media] m88rs2000 1.12 v2 DVB-S frontend and tuner module

Support for m88rs2000 chip used in lmedm04 driver.

Note there are still lock problems.

Slow channel change due to the large block of registers sent in set_frontend.

Version 2 differences.
Front end is completely shut down when in sleep mode. This allow user to regain
control of device.
Kaffeine scan problem solved by removing register calls from get_frontend.
Kaffeine seems to call get_frontend when updating signal data. This can happen
in the middle of a tune stalling the driver.
Change calculations to those in the DS3000 driver.
