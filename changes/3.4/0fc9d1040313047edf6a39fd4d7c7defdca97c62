radix-tree: use iterators in find_get_pages* functions

Replace radix_tree_gang_lookup_slot() and
radix_tree_gang_lookup_tag_slot() in page-cache lookup functions with
brand-new radix-tree direct iterating.  This avoids the double-scanning
and pointer copying.

Iterator don't stop after nr_pages page-get fails in a row, it continue
lookup till the radix-tree end.  Thus we can safely remove these restart
conditions.

Unfortunately, old implementation didn't forbid nr_pages == 0, this corner
case does not fit into new code, so the patch adds an extra check at the
beginning.
