rcu: Simplify offline processing

Move ->qsmaskinit and blkd_tasks[] manipulation to the CPU_DYING
notifier.  This simplifies the code by eliminating a potential
deadlock and by reducing the responsibilities of force_quiescent_state().
Also rename functions to make their connection to the CPU-hotplug
stages explicit.
