ARM: OMAP2+: PM: share some suspend-related functions across OMAP2, 3, 4

The platform_suspend_ops can be shared across OMAP2, 3, and 4, along
with all of the functions referenced in that structure.  This patch
shares them.  It also removes the suspend_state file-scoped variable
in the OMAP2 and 3 PM code; it does not appear to be actually needed
by anything.
