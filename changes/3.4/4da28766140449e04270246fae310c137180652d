[media] it913x: fix firmware loading errors

On some systems the device does not respond or give obscure values after cold,
warm or firmware reboot.

This patch retries to get chip version and type 5 times. If it
fails it applies chip version 0x1 and type 0x9135.

This patch does not fix warm cycle problems from other operating
systems and indeed the reverse applies. Users should power off cold boot.
