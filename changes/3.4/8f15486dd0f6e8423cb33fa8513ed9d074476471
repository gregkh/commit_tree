ixgbe: Default to queue pairs when number of queues is less than CPUs

The old code had several errors in how it was determining the vector
budget.  In order to simplify things this patch updates the code so that it
will attempt to always allocated paired Rx/Tx vectors instead of attempting
to allocate individual vectors when the number of queues is less than the
number of CPUs.
