KVM: Add barriers to allow mmu_notifier_retry to be used locklessly

This adds an smp_wmb in kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end() and an
smp_rmb in mmu_notifier_retry() so that mmu_notifier_retry() will give
the correct answer when called without kvm->mmu_lock being held.
PowerPC Book3S HV KVM wants to use a bitlock per guest page rather than
a single global spinlock in order to improve the scalability of updates
to the guest MMU hashed page table, and so needs this.
