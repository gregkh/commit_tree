VM: don't bother with feeding upper limit to tlb_finish_mmu() in exit_mmap()

no point, really - the only instance that cares about those arguments of
tlb_finish_mmu() is itanic and there we explicitly check if that's called
from exit_mmap() (i.e. that ->fullmm is set), in which case we ignore those
arguments completely.
