simple_open: automatically convert to simple_open()

Many users of debugfs copy the implementation of default_open() when
they want to support a custom read/write function op.  This leads to a
proliferation of the default_open() implementation across the entire
tree.

Now that the common implementation has been consolidated into libfs we
can replace all the users of this function with simple_open().

This replacement was done with the following semantic patch:

<smpl>
@ open @
identifier open_f != simple_open;
identifier i, f;
@@
-int open_f(struct inode *i, struct file *f)
-{
(
-if (i->i_private)
-f->private_data = i->i_private;
|
-f->private_data = i->i_private;
)
-return 0;
-}

@ has_open depends on open @
identifier fops;
identifier open.open_f;
@@
struct file_operations fops = {
...
-.open = open_f,
+.open = simple_open,
...
};
</smpl>
