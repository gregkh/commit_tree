USB/PCI/PCMCIA: Clean up new_id and remove_id sysfs attribute routines

This patch (as1514) cleans up some places where new_id and remove_id
sysfs attributes are created and deleted.  Handling both attributes in
a single routine rather than a pair of routines makes the code
smaller.  It also prevents certain kinds of errors, like one we
currently have in the USB subsystem: The removeid attribute is often
created even when newid isn't (because the driver's no_dynamid_id flag
is set).

In the case of the PCMCIA subsystem, the newid attribute is created
but never explicitly deleted.  The patch adds a deletion routine.
