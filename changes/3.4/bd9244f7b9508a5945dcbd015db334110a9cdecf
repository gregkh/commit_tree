[SCSI] hpsa: update device attributes when they change

Certain types of changes to devices should not be interpreted as a device
change that would cause the device to be removed and re-added.  These include
RAID level and Firmware revision changes.  However, these attribute changes DO
need to be reflected in the controller info structure's dev structure list, so
that sysfs and /proc info files for the devices will reflect the new values.
