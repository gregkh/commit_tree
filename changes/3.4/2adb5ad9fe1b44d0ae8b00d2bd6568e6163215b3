KVM: x86 emulator: Remove byte-sized MOVSX/MOVZX hack

Currently we treat MOVSX/MOVZX with a byte source as a byte instruction,
and change the destination operand size with a hack.  Change it to be
a word instruction, so the destination receives its natural size, and
change the source to be SrcMem8.
