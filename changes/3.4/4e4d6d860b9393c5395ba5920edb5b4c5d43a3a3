sysfs: Add s_hash to sysfs_dirent and order directory entries by hash

Compute a 31 bit hash of directory entries (that can fit in a signed
32bit off_t) and index the sysfs directory entries by that hash,
replacing the per directory indexes by name and by inode.  Because we
now only use a single rbtree this reduces the size of sysfs_dirent by 2
pointers.  Because we have fewer cases to deal with the code is now
simpler.

For now I use the simple hash that the dcache uses as that is easy to
use and seems simple enough.

In addition to makeing the code simpler using a hash for the file
position in readdir brings sysfs in line with other filesystems that
have non-trivial directory structures.
