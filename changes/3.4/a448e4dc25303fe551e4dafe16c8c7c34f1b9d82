EHCI: keep track of ports being resumed and indicate in hub_status_data

This patch (as1537) adds a bit-array to ehci-hcd for keeping track of
which ports are undergoing a resume transition.  If any of the bits
are set when ehci_hub_status_data() is called, the routine will return
a nonzero value even if no ports have any status changes pending.
This will allow usbcore to handle races between root-hub suspend and
port wakeup.
