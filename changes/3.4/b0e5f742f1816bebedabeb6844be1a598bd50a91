powerpc/eeh: pseries platform EEH wait PE state

On pSeries platform, the PE state might be temporarily unavailable.
In that case, the firmware will return the corresponding wait time.
That means the kernel has to wait for appropriate time in order to
get the PE state.

The patch does the implementation for that. Besides, the function
has been abstracted through struct eeh_ops::wait_state so that EEH core
components could support multiple platforms in future.
