net/sched: sch_plug - Queue traffic until an explicit release command

The qdisc supports two operations - plug and unplug. When the
qdisc receives a plug command via netlink request, packets arriving
henceforth are buffered until a corresponding unplug command is received.
Depending on the type of unplug command, the queue can be unplugged
indefinitely or selectively.

This qdisc can be used to implement output buffering, an essential
functionality required for consistent recovery in checkpoint based
fault-tolerance systems. Output buffering enables speculative execution
by allowing generated network traffic to be rolled back. It is used to
provide network protection for Xen Guests in the Remus high availability
project, available as part of Xen.

This module is generic enough to be used by any other system that wishes
to add speculative execution and output buffering to its applications.

This module was originally available in the linux 2.6.32 PV-OPS tree,
used as dom0 for Xen.

Changes in V3:
  * Removed debug output (printk) on queue overflow
  * Added TCQ_PLUG_RELEASE_INDEFINITE - that allows the user to
    use this qdisc, for simple plug/unplug operations.
  * Use of packet counts instead of pointers to keep track of
    the buffers in the queue.
