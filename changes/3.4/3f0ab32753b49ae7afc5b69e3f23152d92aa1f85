serial: make 8250's serial_in shareable to other drivers.

Currently 8250.c has serial_in and serial_out as shortcuts
to doing the port I/O.  They are implemented as macros a
ways down in the file.  This isn't by accident, but is
implicitly required, so cpp doesn't mangle other instances
of the common string "serial_in", as it exists as a field
in the port struct itself.

The above mangling avoidance violates the principle of least
surprise, and it also prevents the shortcuts from being
relocated up to the top of file, or into 8250.h -- either
being a better location than the current one.

Move them to 8250.h so other 8250-like drivers can also use
the shortcuts, and in the process, make the conflicting
names go away by using static inlines instead of macros.
The object file size remains unchanged with this modification.
