dm: add verity target

This device-mapper target creates a read-only device that transparently
validates the data on one underlying device against a pre-generated tree
of cryptographic checksums stored on a second device.

Two checksum device formats are supported: version 0 which is already
shipping in Chromium OS and version 1 which incorporates some
improvements.
