m68knommu: clean up init code in ColdFire 528x startup

We can move all the init calls in the initcall code into the more general
arch setup code (which is config_BSP() here). That makes the 528x consistent
with other ColdFire CPUs setup cod. It means we can get rif of the initcall
setup here all together.
