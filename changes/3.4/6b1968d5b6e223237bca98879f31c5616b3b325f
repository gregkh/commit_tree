HID: make it possible to force hid-core claim the device

Introduce 'hid_ignore_special_drivers' module parameter that makes hid-core
claim the device even if it's listed in hid_have_special_driver[]. This
is useful mostly for debugging purposes and specialized initrds, where
all the hid drivers are not avaiable.
