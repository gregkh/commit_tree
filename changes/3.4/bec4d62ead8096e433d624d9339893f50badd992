kgdb,debug_core: add the ability to control the reboot notifier

Sometimes it is desirable to stop the kernel debugger before allowing
a system to reboot either with kdb or kgdb.  This patch adds the
ability to turn the reboot notifier on and off or enter the debugger
and stop kernel execution before rebooting.

It is possible to change the setting after booting the kernel with the
following:

echo 1 > /sys/module/debug_core/parameters/kgdbreboot

It is also possible to change this setting using kdb / kgdb to
manipulate the variable directly.

Using KDB:
   mm kgdbreboot 1

Using gdb:
   set kgdbreboot=1
