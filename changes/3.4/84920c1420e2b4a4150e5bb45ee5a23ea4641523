net: Allow ipv6 proxies and arp proxies be shown with iproute2

Add ability to return neighbour proxies list to caller if
it sent full ndmsg structure and has NTF_PROXY flag set.

Before this patch (and before iproute2 patches):
$ ip neigh add proxy 2001::1 dev eth0
$ ip -6 neigh show
$

After it and with applied iproute2 patches:
$ ip neigh add proxy 2001::1 dev eth0
$ ip -6 neigh show
2001::1 dev eth0  proxy
$

Compatibility with old versions of iproute2 is not broken,
kernel checks for incoming structure size and properly
works if old structure is came.

[v2]
* changed comments style.
* removed useless line with continue and curly bracket.
* changed incoming message size check from equal to more or
  equal.
