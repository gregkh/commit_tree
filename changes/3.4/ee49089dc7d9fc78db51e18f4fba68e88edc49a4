ACPI, APEI, EINJ, new parameter to control trigger action

Some APEI firmware implementation will access injected address
specified in param1 to trigger the error when injecting memory
error, which means if one SRAR error is injected, the crash
always happens because it is executed in kernel context. This
new parameter can disable trigger action and control is taken
over by the user. In this way, an SRAR error can happen in user
context instead of crashing the system. This function is highly
depended on BIOS implementation so please ensure you know the
BIOS trigger procedure before you enable this switch.

v2:
  notrigger should be created together with param1/param2
