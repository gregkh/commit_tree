[SCSI] libsas: close error handling vs sas_ata_task_done() race

Since sas_ata does not implement ->freeze(), completions for scmds and
internal commands can still arrive concurrent with
ata_scsi_cmd_error_handler() and sas_ata_post_internal() respectively.
By the time either of those is called libata has committed to completing
the qc, and the ATA_PFLAG_FROZEN flag tells sas_ata_task_done() it has
lost the race.

In the sas_ata_post_internal() case we take on the additional
responsibility of freeing the sas_task to close the race with
sas_ata_task_done() freeing the the task while sas_ata_post_internal()
is in the process of invoking ->lldd_abort_task().
