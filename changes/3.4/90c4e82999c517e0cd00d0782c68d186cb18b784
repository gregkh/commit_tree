SUNRPC: put pipefs superblock link on network namespace

We have modules (like, pNFS blocklayout module) which creates pipes on
rpc_pipefs. Thus we need per-net operations for them. To make it possible we
require appropriate super block. So we have to put sb link on network namespace
context. Note, that it's not strongly required to create pipes in per-net
operations. IOW, if pipefs wasn't mounted yet, that no sb link reference will
present on network namespace and in this case we need just need to pass through
pipe creation. Pipe dentry will be created during pipefs mount notification.
