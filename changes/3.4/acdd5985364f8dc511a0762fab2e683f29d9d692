sctp: Allow struct sctp_event_subscribe to grow without breaking binaries

getsockopt(..., SCTP_EVENTS, ...) performs a length check and returns
an error if the user provides less bytes than the size of struct
sctp_event_subscribe.

Struct sctp_event_subscribe needs to be extended by an u8 for every
new event or notification type that is added.

This obviously makes getsockopt fail for binaries that are compiled
against an older versions of <net/sctp/user.h> which do not contain
all event types.

This patch changes getsockopt behaviour to no longer return an error
if not enough bytes are being provided by the user. Instead, it
returns as much of sctp_event_subscribe as fits into the provided buffer.

This leads to the new behavior that users see what they have been aware
of at compile time.

The setsockopt(..., SCTP_EVENTS, ...) API is already behaving like this.
