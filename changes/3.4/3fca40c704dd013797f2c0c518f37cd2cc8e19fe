irq: Add IRQ_TYPE_DEFAULT for use by PIC drivers

This is meant typically to allow a PIC driver's irq domain map() callback
to establish sane defaults for the interrupt (and make sure that the HW
and the irq_desc are in sync as far as the trigger is concerned).

The irq core may not call the set_trigger callback if it thinks the
trigger is already set to the right setting, so we need to ensure new
descriptors are properly synchronized with the hardware.
