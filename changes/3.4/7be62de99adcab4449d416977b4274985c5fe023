vmscan: kswapd carefully call compaction

With CONFIG_COMPACTION enabled, kswapd does not try to free contiguous
free pages, even when it is woken for a higher order request.

This could be bad for eg.  jumbo frame network allocations, which are done
from interrupt context and cannot compact memory themselves.  Higher than
before allocation failure rates in the network receive path have been
observed in kernels with compaction enabled.

Teach kswapd to defragment the memory zones in a node, but only if
required and compaction is not deferred in a zone.
