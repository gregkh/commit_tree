iwlwifi: Sanity check for sta_id

On my testing, I saw some strange behavior

[  421.739708] iwlwifi 0000:01:00.0: ACTIVATE a non DRIVER active station id 148 addr 00:00:00:00:00:00
[  421.739719] iwlwifi 0000:01:00.0: iwl_sta_ucode_activate Added STA id 148 addr 00:00:00:00:00:00 to uCode

not sure how it happen, but adding the sanity check to prevent memory
corruption
