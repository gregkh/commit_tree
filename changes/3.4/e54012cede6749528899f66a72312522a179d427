sysctl: Move sysctl_check_dups into insert_header

Simplify the callers of insert_header by removing explicit calls to check
for duplicates and instead have insert_header do the work.

This makes the code slightly more maintainable by enabling changes to
data structures where the insertion of new entries without duplicate
suppression is not possible.

There is not always a convenient path string where insert_header
is called so modify sysctl_check_dups to use sysctl_print_dir
when printing the full path when a duplicate is discovered.
