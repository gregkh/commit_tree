target: replace various cmd flags with a transport state

Replace various atomic_ts used as flags in struct se_cmd with a single
transport_state bitmap that requires t_state_lock to be held for modifications.

In the target core that assumption generally is true, but some recently added
code in the SRP target had to grow new lock calls.  I can't say I like the way
how it messes with the command state directly, but let's leave that for later.

(Re-add missing ib_srpt.c changes that nab dropped..)
