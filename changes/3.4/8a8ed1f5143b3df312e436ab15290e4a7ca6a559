drm/i915: Fix race condition in accessing GMBUS

GMBUS has several ports and each has it's own corresponding
I2C adpater. When multiple I2C adapters call gmbus_xfer() at
the same time there is a race condition in using the underlying
GMBUS controller. Fixing this by adding a mutex lock when calling
gmbus_xfer().

v2: Moved gmbus_mutex below intel_gmbus and added comments.
Rebased to drm-intel-next-queued.

revision comment to the commit message.]
