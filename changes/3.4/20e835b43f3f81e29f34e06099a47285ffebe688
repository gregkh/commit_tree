[SCSI] qla4xxx: Fix verify boot idx correctly

qla4xxx_verify_boot_idx can falsely report a DDB to be boot target
if ha->pri_ddb_idx and ha->sec_ddb_idx are not initialized correctly.
What this could cause is if there is DDB entry in FLash at index 0, then
qla4xxx_verify_boot_idx would return wrong result as ha->pri_ddb_idx is not
set correctly. Fixed the qla4xxx_get_boot_info to set the ha->pri_ddb_idx and
ha->sec_ddb_idx correctly.
