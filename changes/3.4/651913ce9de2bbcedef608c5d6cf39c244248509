tcp: clean up use of jiffies in tcp_rcv_rtt_measure()

Clean up a reference to jiffies in tcp_rcv_rtt_measure() that should
instead reference tcp_time_stamp. Since the result of the subtraction
is passed into a function taking u32, this should not change any
behavior (and indeed the generated assembly does not change on
x86_64). However, it seems worth cleaning this up for consistency and
clarity (and perhaps to avoid bugs if this is copied and pasted
somewhere else).
