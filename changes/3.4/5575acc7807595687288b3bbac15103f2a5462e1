xfs: fix deadlock in xfs_rtfree_extent

To fix the deadlock caused by repeatedly calling xfs_rtfree_extent

 - removed xfs_ilock() and xfs_trans_ijoin() from xfs_rtfree_extent(),
   instead added asserts that the inode is locked and has an inode_item
   attached to it.
 - in xfs_bunmapi() when dealing with an inode with the rt flag
   call xfs_ilock() and xfs_trans_ijoin() so that the
   reference count is bumped on the inode and attached it to the
   transaction before calling into xfs_bmap_del_extent, similar to
   what we do in xfs_bmap_rtalloc.
