Revert "nouveau/bios: Fix tracking of BIOS image data"

This reverts commit d06221c0617ab6d0bc41c4980cefdd9c8cc9a1c1.

It turns out to trigger the "BUG_ON(!PageCompound(page))" in kfree(),
apparently because the code ends up trying to free somethng that was
never kmalloced in the first place.

BenH points out that the patch was untested and wasn't meant to go into
the upstream kernel that quickly in the first place.
