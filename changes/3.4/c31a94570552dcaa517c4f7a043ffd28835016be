perf report: Add a simple GTK2-based 'perf report' browser

This patch adds a simple GTK2-based browser to 'perf report' that's
based on the TTY-based browser in builtin-report.c.

To launch "perf report" using the new GTK interface just type:

  $ perf report --gtk

The interface is somewhat limited in features at the moment:

  - No callgraph support

  - No KVM guest profiling support

  - No color coding for percentages

  - No sorting from the UI

  - ..and many, many more!

That said, I think this patch a reasonable start to build future features on.
