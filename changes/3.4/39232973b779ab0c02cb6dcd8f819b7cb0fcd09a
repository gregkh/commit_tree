ipv4/ipv6: Prepare for new route gateway semantics.

In the future the ipv4/ipv6 route gateway will take on two types
of values:

1) INADDR_ANY/IN6ADDR_ANY, for local network routes, and in this case
   the neighbour must be obtained using the destination address in
   ipv4/ipv6 header as the lookup key.

2) Everything else, the actual nexthop route address.

So if the gateway is not inaddr-any we use it, otherwise we must use
the packet's destination address.
