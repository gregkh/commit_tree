e1000e: cleanup e1000_init_mac_params_80003es2lan()

Combine two switch statements into one, convert a nebulous pointer to one
that is a bit more in keeping with the rest of the driver code and remove
some dead code (there are no 80003es2lan devices with fiber).  No change in
functionality, just cosmetic changes.
