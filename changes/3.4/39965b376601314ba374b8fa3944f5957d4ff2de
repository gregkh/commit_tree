drm/i915: don't trash the gtt when running out of fences

With the fence accounting fixed up in the previous commit not finding
enough fences is a fatal error and userspace bug. Trashing the entire
gtt is not gonna turn up that missing fence, so don't to this by
returning another error thatn ENOSPC.

This has the added benefit that it's easier to distinguish fence
accounting errors from gtt space accounting issues.

TTM serves as precendence for the EDEADLK error code - it returns it
when the reservation code needs resources already blocked by the
current reservation.
