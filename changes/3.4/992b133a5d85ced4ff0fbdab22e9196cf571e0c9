mfd: Spawned db8500 regulators update

As drivers have progressed and got some more review we have
consequently moved things around:

- Some device drivers have changed name and some were wrong
  from the beginning.
- We removed the dependency from some domains to the VAPE
  domain -  SIA MMDSP, SIA PIPE, SVA MMDSP and SVA PIPE power
  domains are handled outside the framework while ESRAM12
  and ESRAM34 are actually handled inside the PRCMU.
