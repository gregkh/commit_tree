net: qmi_wwan: add Gobi and Pantech UML290 device IDs

Adding the Pantech UML290 and all non-QDL Gobi device IDs from the
qcserial driver now that we have support for shared net/QMI USB
interfaces.  Most of these are not yet tested with this driver, but
should be mostly identical to tested devices, except for device IDs.

Gobi devices provide several different interfaces (serial/net/other)
using the exact same class, subclass and protocol values.  This driver
will only support the net/QMI function while there are other drivers
supporting other device functions. The net/QMI interface number may
also differ from device to device.  It has been noted that all the
other interfaces have additional functional descriptors, so we use that
to detect the interface supported by this driver.
