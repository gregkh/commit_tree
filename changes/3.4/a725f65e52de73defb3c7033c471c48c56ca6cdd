rbd: encapsulate argument parsing for rbd_add()

Move the code that parses the arguments provided to rbd_add() (which
are supplied via /sys/bus/rbd/add) into a separate function.

Also rename the "mon_dev_name" variable in rbd_add() to be
"mon_addrs".   The variable represents a list of one or more
comma-separated monitor IP addresses, each with an optional port
number.  I think "mon_addrs" captures that notion a little better.
