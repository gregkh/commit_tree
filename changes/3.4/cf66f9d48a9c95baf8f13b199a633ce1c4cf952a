xen/netfront: add netconsole support.

add polling interface to xen-netfront device to support netconsole

This patch also alters the spin_lock usage to use irqsave variant.
Documentation/networking/netdevices.txt states that start_xmit
can be called with interrupts disabled by netconsole and therefore using
the irqsave/restore locking in this function is looks correct.
