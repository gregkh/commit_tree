ARM: OMAP3: USB: Fix the EHCI ULPI PHY reset issue

It is observed that the echi ports of 3430 sdp board
are not working due to the random timing of programming
the associated GPIOs of the ULPI PHYs of the EHCI for reset.
If the PHYs are reset at during usbhs core driver, host ports will
not work because EHCI driver is loaded after the resetting PHYs.
The PHYs should be in reset state while initializing the EHCI
controller.
The code which does the GPIO pins associated with the PHYs
are programmed to reset is moved from the USB host core driver
to EHCI driver.
