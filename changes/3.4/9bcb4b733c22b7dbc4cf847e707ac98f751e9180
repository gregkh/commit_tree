vfs: turn generic_drop_inode() into static inline

Once upon a time it used to be much bigger, but these days there's
no point whatsoever keeping it in fs/inode.c, especially since
it's not even needed as initializer for ->drop_inode() - it's the
default and leaving ->drop_inode NULL will do just as well.
