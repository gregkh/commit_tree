x86, apic: APIC code touches invalid MSR on P5 class machines

Current APIC code assumes MSR_IA32_APICBASE is present for all systems.
Pentium Classic P5 and friends didn't have this MSR. MSR_IA32_APICBASE
was introduced as an architectural MSR by Intel @ P6.

Code paths that can touch this MSR invalidly are when vendor == Intel &&
cpu-family == 5 and APIC bit is set in CPUID - or when you simply pass
lapic on the kernel command line, on a P5.

The below patch stops Linux incorrectly interfering with the
MSR_IA32_APICBASE for P5 class machines. Other code paths exist that
touch the MSR - however those paths are not currently reachable for a
conformant P5.
