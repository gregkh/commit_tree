ixgbe: Two minor fixes for RSS and FDIR set queues functions

This change fixes two minor issues. The first was the fact that we were
setting the return value to false twice in the set_rss_queues function.
The second is the fact that we should have been using "min_t(int," instead
of "min((int)" in set_fdir_queues.
