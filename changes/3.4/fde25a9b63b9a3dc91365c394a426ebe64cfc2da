Driver core: driver_find() drops reference before returning

As part of the removal of get_driver()/put_driver(), this patch
(as1510) changes driver_find(); it now drops the reference it acquires
before returning.  The patch also adjusts all the callers of
driver_find() to remove the now unnecessary calls to put_driver().

In addition, the patch adds a warning to driver_find(): Callers must
make sure the driver they are searching for does not get unloaded
while they are using it.  This has always been the case; driver_find()
has never prevented a driver from being unregistered or unloaded.
Hence the patch will not introduce any new bugs.  The existing callers
all seem to be okay in this respect, however I don't understand the
video drivers well enough to be certain about them.
