drm/i915: Handle unmappable buffers during error state capture

As the buffer is not necessarily accessible through the GTT at the time
of a GPU hang, and capturing some of its contents is far more valuable
than skipping it, provide a clflushed fallback read path. We still
prefer to read through the GTT as that is more consistent with the GPU
access of the same buffer. So example it will demonstrate any errorneous
tiling or swizzling of the command buffer as seen by the GPU.

This becomes necessary with use of CPU relocations and lazy GTT binding,
but could potentially happen anyway as a result of a pathological error.
