bus: arm-ccn: Move event cleanup routine

The function cleaning up an initialized event
was called from the "event_del" handler, instead
of being used as the "destroy" callback. In case of
events group allocation this caused NULL pointer
dereference (as events are added and deleted
multiple times then). Fixed now.
