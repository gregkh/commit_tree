sched/numa: Always try to migrate to preferred node at task_numa_placement() time

It is possible that at task_numa_placement() time, the task's
numa_preferred_nid does not change, but the task is not
actually running on the preferred node at the time.

In that case, we still want to attempt migration to the
preferred node.
