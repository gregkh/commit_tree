powerpc/fsl-booke: Add support for T2080/T2081 SoC

The T2080 QorIQ multicore processor combines four dual-threaded e6500 Power
Architecture processor cores with high-performance datapath acceleration
logic and network and peripheral bus interfaces required for networking,
telecom/datacom, wireless infrastructure, and mil/aerospace applications.

The T2080 SoC includes the following function and features:
- Four dual-threaded 64-bit Power architecture e6500 cores, up to 1.8GHz
- 2MB L2 cache and 512KB CoreNet platform cache (CPC)
- Hierarchical interconnect fabric
- One 32-/64-bit DDR3/3L SDRAM memory controllers with ECC and interleaving
- Data Path Acceleration Architecture (DPAA) incorporating acceleration
- 16 SerDes lanes up to 10.3125 GHz
- 8 Ethernet interfaces (multiple 1G/2.5G/10G MACs)
- High-speed peripheral interfaces
  - Four PCI Express controllers (two PCIe 2.0 and two PCIe 3.0)
  - Two Serial RapidIO 2.0 controllers/ports running at up to 5 GHz
- Additional peripheral interfaces
  - Two serial ATA (SATA 2.0) controllers
  - Two high-speed USB 2.0 controllers with integrated PHY
  - Enhanced secure digital host controller (SD/SDXC/eMMC)
  - Enhanced serial peripheral interface (eSPI)
  - Four I2C controllers
  - Four 2-pin UARTs or two 4-pin UARTs
  - Integrated Flash Controller supporting NAND and NOR flash
- Three eight-channel DMA engines
- Support for hardware virtualization and partitioning enforcement
- QorIQ Platform's Trust Architecture 2.0

T2081 is a reduced personality of T2080 with following difference:
Feature               T2080 T2081
1G Ethernet numbers:  8     6
10G Ethernet numbers: 4     2
SerDes lanes:         16    8
Serial RapidIO,RMan:  2     no
SATA Controller:      2     no
Aurora:               yes   no
SoC Package:          896-pins 780-pins
