spi: rspi: Relax DMA dependency and increase build coverage

As of commit ab116a4df4942c78c189d9b0744dd940ab9e00b9 ("dmaengine:
shdma: fix a build failure on platforms with no DMA support"), the DMA
filter function shdma_chan_filter() is sufficiently abstracted to allow
building without DMA support. Hence drop the SH_DMAE_BASE dependency on
SUPERH.
Also increase build coverage by allowing the driver to be enabled if
COMPILE_TEST=y.
