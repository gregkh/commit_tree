alarmtimer: Return relative times in timer_gettime

Returns the time remaining for an alarm timer, rather than the time at
which it is scheduled to expire.  If the timer has already expired or it
is not currently scheduled, the it_value's members are set to zero.

This new behavior matches that of the other posix-timers and the POSIX
specifications.

This is a change in user-visible behavior, and may break existing
applications.  Hopefully, few users rely on the old incorrect behavior.
