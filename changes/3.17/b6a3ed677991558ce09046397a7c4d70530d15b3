USB: storage: Add quirk for Ariston Technologies iConnect USB to SCSI adapter

Hi,

The Ariston Technologies iConnect 025 and iConnect 050 (also known as e.g.
iSCSI-50) are SCSI-USB converters which use Shuttle Technology/SCM
Microsystems chips. Only the connectors differ; both have the same USB ID.
The US_FL_SCM_MULT_TARG quirk is required to use SCSI devices with ID other
than 0.

I don't have one of these, but based on the other entries for Shuttle/
SCM-based converters this patch is very likely correct. I used 0x0000 and
0x9999 for bcdDeviceMin and bcdDeviceMax because I'm not sure which
bcdDevice value the products use.
