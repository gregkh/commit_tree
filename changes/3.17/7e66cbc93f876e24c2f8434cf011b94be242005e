ARM: LPAE: drop wrong carry flag correction after adding TTBR1_OFFSET

In commit 7fb00c2fca4b6c58be521eb3676cf4b4ba8dde3b ("ARM: 8114/1: LPAE:
load upper bits of early TTBR0/TTBR1") part which fixes carrying in adding
TTBR1_OFFSET to TTRR1 was wrong:

        addls   ttbr1, ttbr1, #TTBR1_OFFSET
        adcls   tmp, tmp, #0

addls doesn't update flags, adcls adds carry from cmp above:

        cmp     ttbr1, tmp                    @ PHYS_OFFSET > PAGE_OFFSET?

Condition 'ls' means carry flag is clear or zero flag is set, thus only one
case is affected: when PHYS_OFFSET == PAGE_OFFSET.

It seems safer to remove this fixup. Bug is here for ages and nobody
complained. Let's fix it separately.
