ARM: add SMP support for Broadcom mobile SoCs

This patch adds SMP support for BCM281XX and BCM21664 family SoCs.

This feature is controlled with a distinct config option such that
an SMP-enabled multi-v7 binary can be configured to run these SoCs
in uniprocessor mode.  Since this SMP functionality is used for
multiple Broadcom mobile chip families the config option is called
ARCH_BCM_MOBILE_SMP (for lack of a better name).

On SoCs of this type, the secondary core is not held in reset on
power-on.  Instead it loops in a ROM-based holding pen.  To release
it, one must write into a special register a jump address whose
low-order bits have been replaced with a secondary core's id, then
trigger an event with SEV.  On receipt of an event, the ROM code
will examine the register's contents, and if the low-order bits
match its cpu id, it will clear them and write the value back to the
register just prior to jumping to the address specified.

The location of the special register is defined in the device tree
using a "secondary-boot-reg" property in a node whose "enable-method"
matches.
