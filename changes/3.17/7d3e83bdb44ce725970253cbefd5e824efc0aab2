ACPICA: Hardware: back port of a recursive locking fix

This patch is a back port result of the following Linux commit:
 Commit: f7f71cfbf0c276ee3d8d856d0f35a41aed997fa4
 Author: Rakib Mullick <rakib.mullick@gmail.com>
 Subject: ACPI: Fix possible recursive locking in hwregs.c

As a result of different coding style rules, the back ported code generates
source code differences between the Linux kernel and the ACPICA upstream.
This patch reduces such source code differences.
