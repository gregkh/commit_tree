Revert "Btrfs: device_list_add() should not update list when mounted"

This reverts commit b96de000bc8bc9688b3a2abea4332bd57648a49f.

This commit is triggering failures to mount by subvolume id in some
configurations.  The main problem is how many different ways this
scanning function is used, both for scanning while mounted and
unmounted.  A proper cleanup is too big for late rcs.

For now, just revert the commit and we'll put a better fix into a later
merge window.
