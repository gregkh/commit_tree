ASoC: Auto disconnect pins from all DAPM contexts

Currently only pins in CODEC DAPM contexts are automatically marked as
non-connected if the card has the fully_routed flag set. This makes sense since
widgets which qualify for auto-disconnection are only found in CODEC DAPM
contexts. But with componentisation this is going to change, so consider all
widgets for auto-disconnection.

Also it is probably faster to walk the widgets list only once rather than once
for each CODEC.
