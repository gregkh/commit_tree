serial: 8250_dw: use UPF_* constants when define flags

The flags member has upf_t type and corresponding macros to define them. This
patch converts ASYNC_SKIP_TEST to UPF_SKIP_TEST in 8250_dw.c.

Otherwise we got a sparse warning:
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c:302:46: warning: restricted upf_t degrades to integer
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c:302:62: warning: restricted upf_t degrades to integer
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c:302:26: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c:302:26:    expected restricted upf_t [usertype] flags
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c:302:26:    got unsigned int
