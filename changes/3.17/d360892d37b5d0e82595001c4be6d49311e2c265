irqchip: crossbar: Allow for quirky hardware with direct hardwiring of GIC

On certain platforms such as DRA7, SPIs 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 131,
132, 133 are direct wired to hardware blocks bypassing crossbar.
This quirky implementation is *NOT* supposed to be the expectation
of crossbar hardware usage. However, these are already marked in our
description of the hardware with SKIP and RESERVED where appropriate.

Unfortunately, we need to be able to refer to these hardwired IRQs.
So, to request these, crossbar driver can use the existing information
from it's table that these SKIP/RESERVED maps are direct wired sources
and generic allocation/programming of crossbar should be avoided.
