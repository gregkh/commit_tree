arm64: move DBG_MDSCR_* to asm/debug-monitors.h

In order to be able to use the DBG_MDSCR_* macros from the KVM code,
move the relevant definitions to the obvious include file.

Also move the debug_el enum to a portion of the file that is guarded
by #ifndef __ASSEMBLY__ in order to use that file from assembly code.
