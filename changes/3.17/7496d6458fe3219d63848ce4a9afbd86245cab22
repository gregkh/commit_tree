Define kernel API to get address of each state in xsave area

In standard form, each state is saved in the xsave area in fixed offset.
But in compacted form, offset of each saved state only can be calculated during
run time because some xstates may not be enabled and saved.

We define kernel API get_xsave_addr() returns address of a given state saved in a xsave area.

It can be called in kernel to get address of each xstate in xsave area in
either standard format or compacted format.

It's useful when kernel wants to directly access each state in xsave area.
