arm/arm64: KVM: Complete WFI/WFE instructions

The architecture specifies that when the processor wakes up from a WFE
or WFI instruction, the instruction is considered complete, however we
currrently return to EL1 (or EL0) at the WFI/WFE instruction itself.

While most guests may not be affected by this because their local
exception handler performs an exception returning setting the event bit
or with an interrupt pending, some guests like UEFI will get wedged due
this little mishap.

Simply skip the instruction when we have completed the emulation.
