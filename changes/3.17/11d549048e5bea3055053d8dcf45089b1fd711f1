powerpc: Fix "attempt to move .org backwards" error

Once again, we see

arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S: Assembler messages:
arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:865: Error: attempt to move .org backwards
arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:866: Error: attempt to move .org backwards
arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:890: Error: attempt to move .org backwards

when compiling ppc:allmodconfig.

This time the problem has been caused by to commit 0869b6fd209bda
("powerpc/book3s: Add basic infrastructure to handle HMI in Linux"),
which adds functions hmi_exception_early and hmi_exception_after_realmode
into a critical (size-limited) code area, even though that does not appear
to be necessary.

Move those functions to a non-critical area of the file.
