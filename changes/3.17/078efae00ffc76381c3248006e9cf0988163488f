[SCSI] cxgb4i: avoid holding mutex in interrupt context

cxgbi_inet6addr_handler() can be called in interrupt context, so use rcu
protected list while finding netdev.  This is observed as a scheduling in
atomic oops when running over ipv6.

Fixes: 759a0cc5a3e1 ("cxgb4i: Add ipv6 code to driver, call into libcxgbi ipv6 api")
