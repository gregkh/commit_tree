kvm: ppc: bookehv: Added wrapper macros for shadow registers

There are shadow registers like, GSPRG[0-3], GSRR0, GSRR1 etc on
BOOKE-HV and these shadow registers are guest accessible.
So these shadow registers needs to be updated on BOOKE-HV.
This patch adds new macro for get/set helper of shadow register .
