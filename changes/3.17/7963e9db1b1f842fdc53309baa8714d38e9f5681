Revert "drm: drop redundant drm_file->is_master"

This reverts commit 48ba813701eb14b3008edefef4a0789b328e278c.

Thanks to Chris:
"drm_file->is_master is not synomous with having drm_file->master ==
drm_file->minor->master. This is because drm_file->master is the same
for all drm_files of the same generation and so when there is a master,
every drm_file believes itself to be the master. Confusion ensues and
things go pear shaped when one file is closed and there is no master
anymore."
