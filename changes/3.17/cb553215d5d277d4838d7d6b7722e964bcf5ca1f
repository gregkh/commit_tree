include/uapi/linux/virtio_blk.h: introduce feature of VIRTIO_BLK_F_MQ

Current virtio-blk spec only supports one virtual queue for transfering
data between VM and host, and inside VM all kinds of operations on
the virtual queue needs to hold one lock, so cause below problems:

	- bad scalability
	- bad throughput

This patch requests to introduce feature of VIRTIO_BLK_F_MQ
so that more than one virtual queues can be used to virtio-blk
device, then above problems can be solved or eased.
