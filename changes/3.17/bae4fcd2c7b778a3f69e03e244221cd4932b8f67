drm/i915/bdw: poll semaphores

As Ville points out, it's possible/probable we don't actually need this.
Potentially, this validates the letter of the spec, and not the spirit.

Rodrigo: Spec suggests this as an W/A for GT3. However semaphores didn't
worked in my BDW GT2 on Signal Mode. So pool mode is definitely needed.
