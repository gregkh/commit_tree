Input: wacom - create a separate input device for pads

Currently, the pad events are sent through the stylus input device
for the Intuos/Cintiqs, and through the touch input device for the
Bamboos.

To differentiate the buttons pressed on the pad from the ones pressed
on the stylus, the Intuos/Cintiq uses MISC_SERIAL and ABS_MISC. This
lead to a multiplexing of the events into one device, which are then
splitted out in xf86-input-wacom. Bamboos are not using MISC events
because the pad is attached to the touch interface, and only BTN_TOUCH
is used for the finger (and DOUBLE_TAP, etc...). However, the user space
driver still splits out the pad from the touch interface in the same
way it does for the pro line devices.

The other problem we can see with this fact is that some of the Intuos
and Cintiq have a wheel, and the effective range of the reported values
is [0..71]. Unfortunately, the airbrush stylus also sends wheel events
(there is a small wheel on it), but in the range [0..1023]. From the user
space point of view it is kind of difficult to understand that because
the wheel on the pad are quite common, while the airbrush tool is not.

A solution to fix all of these problems is to split out the pad device
from the stylus/touch. This decision makes more sense because the pad is
not linked to the absolute position of the finger or pen, and usually, the
events from the pad are filtered out by the compositor, which then convert
them into actions or keyboard shortcuts.

For backward compatibility with current xf86-input-wacom, the pad devices
still present the ABS_X, ABS_Y and ABS_MISC events, but they can be
completely ignored in the new implementation.
