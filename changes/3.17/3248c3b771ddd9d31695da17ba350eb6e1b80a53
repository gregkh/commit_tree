hwmon: (lm85) Fix various errors on attribute writes

Temperature limit register writes did not account for negative numbers.
As a result, writing -127000 resulted in -126000 written into the
temperature limit register. This problem affected temp[1-3]_min,
temp[1-3]_max, temp[1-3]_auto_temp_crit, and temp[1-3]_auto_temp_min.

When writing pwm[1-3]_freq, a long variable was auto-converted into an int
without range check. Wiring values larger than MAXINT resulted in unexpected
register values.

When writing temp[1-3]_auto_temp_max, an unsigned long variable was
auto-converted into an int without range check. Writing values larger than
MAXINT resulted in unexpected register values.

vrm is an u8, so the written value needs to be limited to [0, 255].
