toshiba_acpi: Add extra check to backlight code

Some Toshiba models (most notably Qosmios) come with an
incomplete backlight method where the AML code doesn't
check for write or read commands and always returns
HCI_SUCCESS and the actual brightness (and in some
cases the max brightness), thus allowing the backlight
interface to be registered without write support.

This patch changes the set_lcd_brightness function,
checking the returned values for values greater than
zero to avoid registering a broken backlight interface.
