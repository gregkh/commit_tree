net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmfmac: Make return type and name reflect actual semantics

Applying ++ to a bool is equivalent to setting it true, regardless of
its initial value (bools are not uint1_t). Hence the function
wl_get_vif_state_all can only ever return true/false. The only in-tree
caller uses its return value as a boolean. So update its return type,
and since the list traversal and bit testing have no side effects,
just return true immediately. Its return value tells if any vif is in
the specified state, so also rename it to brcmf_get_vif_state_any.
