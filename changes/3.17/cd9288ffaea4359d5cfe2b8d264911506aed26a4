NFSv4: Fix another bug in the close/open_downgrade code

James Drew reports another bug whereby the NFS client is now sending
an OPEN_DOWNGRADE in a situation where it should really have sent a
CLOSE: the client is opening the file for O_RDWR, but then trying to
do a downgrade to O_RDONLY, which is not allowed by the NFSv4 spec.
