arm64: Determine the vmalloc/vmemmap space at build time based on VA_BITS

Rather than guessing what the maximum vmmemap space should be, this
patch allows the calculation based on the VA_BITS and sizeof(struct
page). The vmalloc space extends to the beginning of the vmemmap space.

Since the virtual kernel memory layout now depends on the build
configuration, this patch removes the detailed description in
Documentation/arm64/memory.txt in favour of information printed during
kernel booting.
