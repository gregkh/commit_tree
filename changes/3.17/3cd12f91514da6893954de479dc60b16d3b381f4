usb: force warm reset to break link re-connect livelock

Resuming a powered down port sometimes results in the port state being
stuck in the training sequence.

 hub 3-0:1.0: debounce: port 1: total 2000ms stable 0ms status 0x2e0
 port1: can't get reconnection after setting port  power on, status -110
 hub 3-0:1.0: port 1 status 0000.02e0 after resume, -19
 usb 3-1: can't resume, status -19
 hub 3-0:1.0: logical disconnect on port 1

In the case above we wait for the port re-connect timeout of 2 seconds
and observe that the port status is USB_SS_PORT_LS_POLLING (although it
is likely toggling between this state and USB_SS_PORT_LS_RX_DETECT).
This is indicative of a case where the device is failing to progress the
link training state machine.

It is resolved by issuing a warm reset to get the hub and device link
state machines back in sync.

 hub 3-0:1.0: debounce: port 1: total 2000ms stable 0ms status 0x2e0
 usb usb3: port1 usb_port_runtime_resume requires warm reset
 hub 3-0:1.0: port 1 not warm reset yet, waiting 50ms
 usb 3-1: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 2 using xhci_hcd

After a reconnect timeout when we expect the device to be present, force
a warm reset of the device.  Note that we can not simply look at the
link status to determine if a warm reset is required as any of the
training states USB_SS_PORT_LS_POLLING, USB_SS_PORT_LS_RX_DETECT, or
USB_SS_PORT_LS_COMP_MOD are valid states that do not indicate the need
for warm reset by themselves.
