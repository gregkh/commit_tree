ufs: fix DMA mask setting

If the controller doesn't support 64-bit addressing mode, it must not
set the DMA mask to 64-bit.  But it's unconditionally trying to set to
64-bit without checking 64-bit addressing support in the controller
capabilities.

It was correctly checked before commit 3b1d05807a9a68c6d0580e9248247a774a4d3be6
("[SCSI] ufs: Segregate PCI Specific Code"), this aims to restores
the correct behaviour.

To achieve this in a generic way, firstly we should push down the DMA
mask setting routine ufshcd_set_dma_mask() from PCI glue driver to core
driver in order to do it for both PCI glue driver and Platform glue
driver.  Secondly, we should change pci_ DMA mapping API to dma_ DMA
mapping API because core driver is independent of glue drivers.
