brcmfmac: rework debugfs functions in the driver

Reworked the debugfs functions in the driver making it easier for
other driver parts to add a debugfs entry and keeping the information
they want to expose in debugfs private, ie. not in a header.

This is accomplished by providing the function brcmf_debugfs_add_entry()
in which the caller provides a read function in which they provide the
content. The debugfs function will take care of creating the debugfs
entry and cleaning up upon removal.
