[media] media: dib9000: avoid out of bound access

This updated patch also fixes out of bound access to b[].

In dib9000_risc_apb_access_write() an out of bound access to mb[].

The current test to avoid out of bound access to mb[] is insufficient.
For len = 19 non-existent mb[10] will be accessed.

For odd values of len b[] is accessed out of bounds.

For large values of len an of bound access to mb[] may occur in
dib9000_mbx_send_attr.
