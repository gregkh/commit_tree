bbc-i2c: Fix BBC I2C envctrl on SunBlade 2000

Fix regression in bbc i2c temperature and fan control on some Sun systems
that causes the driver to refuse to load due to the bbc_i2c_bussel resource not
being present on the (second) i2c bus where the temperature sensors and fan
control are located. (The check for the number of resources was removed when
the driver was ported to a pure OF driver in mid 2008.)
