bonding: permit enslaving interfaces without set_mac support

Currently we exit if the slave isn't the first slave, doesn't support mac
address setting and fail_over_mac isn't FOM_ACTIVE. It's wrong because we
only require ndo_set_mac_address in case bonding is in active-backup mode
and FOM isn't FOM_ACTIVE.

To fix this - only exit with an error if we're in a/b mode and have
fail_over_mac != FOM_ACTIVE.

Also, maintain current behaviour on the first slave (forcibly change fom to
FOM_ACTIVE) to not break anyone's configuration.
