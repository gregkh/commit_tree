net: filter: split filter.c into two files

BPF is used in several kernel components. This split creates logical boundary
between generic eBPF core and the rest

kernel/bpf/core.c: eBPF interpreter

net/core/filter.c: classic->eBPF converter, classic verifiers, socket filters

This patch only moves functions.
