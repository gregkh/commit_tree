drm/gem: remove misleading gfp parameter to get_pages()

drm_gem_get_pages() currently allows passing a 'gfp' parameter that is
passed to shmem combined with mapping_gfp_mask(). Given that the default
mapping_gfp_mask() is GFP_HIGHUSER, it is _very_ unlikely that anyone will
ever make use of that parameter. In fact, all drivers currently pass
redundant flags or 0.

This patch removes the 'gfp' parameter. The only reason to keep it is to
remove flags like __GFP_WAIT. But in its current form, it can only be used
to add flags. So to remove __GFP_WAIT, you'd have to drop it from the
mapping_gfp_mask, which again is stupid as this mask is used by shmem-core
for other allocations, too.

If any driver ever requires that parameter, we can introduce a new helper
that takes the raw 'gfp' parameter. The caller'd be responsible to combine
it with mapping_gfp_mask() in a suitable way. The current
drm_gem_get_pages() helper would then simply use mapping_gfp_mask() and
call the new helper. This is what shmem_read_mapping_pages{_gfp,} does
right now.

Moreover, the gfp-zone flag-usage is not obvious: If you pass a modified
zone, shmem core will WARN() or even BUG(). In other words, the following
must be true for 'gfp' passed to shmem_read_mapping_pages_gfp():
    gfp_zone(mapping_gfp_mask(mapping)) == gfp_zone(gfp)
Add a comment to drm_gem_read_pages() explaining that constraint.
