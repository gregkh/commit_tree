scsi: fix the {host,target,device}_blocked counter mess

Seems like these counters are missing any sort of synchronization for
updates, as a over 10 year old comment from me noted.  Fix this by
using atomic counters, and while we're at it also make sure they are
in the same cacheline as the _busy counters and not needlessly stored
to in every I/O completion.

With the new model the _busy counters can temporarily go negative,
so all the readers are updated to check for > 0 values.  Longer
term every successful I/O completion will reset the counters to zero,
so the temporarily negative values will not cause any harm.
