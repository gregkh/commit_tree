IB/mlx4: Avoid null pointer dereference in mlx4_ib_scan_netdevs()

When Ethernet netdev is not present for a port (e.g. when the link
layer type of the port is InfiniBand) it's possible to dereference a
null pointer when we do netdevice scanning.

To fix that, we move a section of code that needs to run only when
netdev is present to a proper if () statement.
