ACPICA: OSL: Update acpidump to reduce source code differences

This patch is a result of an ACPICA commit to enables acpidump for EFI. For
Linux kernel, this patch is a no-op. It is only required by the ACPICA
release process to reduce the source code differences between the Linux
kernel and the ACPICA upstream. Lv Zheng.
