ACPI / processor: Introduce ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_ACPI_PDC

The use of _PDC is deprecated in ACPI 3.0 in favor of _OSC,
as ARM platform is supported only in ACPI 5.0 or higher version,
_PDC will not be used in ARM platform, so make Make _PDC only for
platforms with Intel CPUs.

Introduce ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_ACPI_PDC and move _PDC related code in
ACPI processor driver into a single file processor_pdc.c, make x86
and ia64 select it when ACPI is enabled.

This patch also use pr_* to replace printk to fix the checkpatch
warning and factor acpi_processor_alloc_pdc() a little bit to
avoid duplicate pr_err() code.
