net: bcmgenet: handle UMAC_IRQ_MPD_R interrupt bit

Handle UMAC_IRQ_MPD_R interrupt bit in our workqueue to make sure that
we properly re-configure the GENET adapter from Wake-on-LAN.

bcmgenet_power_up() makes sure that we will not leave the UniMAC
hardware in MagicPacket matching mode, since that would prevent any
other packet from being received.
