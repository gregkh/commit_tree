ACPI / RTC: Fix CMOS RTC opregion handler accesses to wrong addresses

The value64 parameter is an u64 point that used to transfer the value
for write to CMOS, or used to return the value that's read from CMOS.

The value64 is an u64 point, so don't need get address again. It causes
acpi_cmos_rtc_space_handler always return 0 to reader and didn't write
expected value to CMOS.
