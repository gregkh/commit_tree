reservation: update api and add some helpers

Move the list of shared fences to a struct, and return it in
reservation_object_get_list().
Add reservation_object_get_excl to get the exclusive fence.

Add reservation_object_reserve_shared(), which reserves space
in the reservation_object for 1 more shared fence.

reservation_object_add_shared_fence() and
reservation_object_add_excl_fence() are used to assign a new
fence to a reservation_object pointer, to complete a reservation.

Changes since v1:
- Add reservation_object_get_excl, reorder code a bit.
