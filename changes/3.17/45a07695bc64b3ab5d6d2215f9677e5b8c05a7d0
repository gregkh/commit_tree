tcp: Fix integer-overflows in TCP veno

In veno we do a multiplication of the cwnd and the rtt. This
may overflow and thus their result is stored in a u64. However, we first
need to cast the cwnd so that actually 64-bit arithmetic is done.

A first attempt at fixing 76f1017757aa0 ([TCP]: TCP Veno congestion
control) was made by 159131149c2 (tcp: Overflow bug in Vegas), but it
failed to add the required cast in tcp_veno_cong_avoid().
