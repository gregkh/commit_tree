virtio-rng: fix stuck of hot-unplugging busy device

When we try to hot-remove a busy virtio-rng device from QEMU monitor,
the device can't be hot-removed. Because virtio-rng driver hangs at
wait_for_completion_killable().

This patch exits the waiting by completing have_data completion before
unregistering, resets data_avail to avoid the hwrng core use wrong
buffer bytes.
