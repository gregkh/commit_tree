arm64: ptrace: fix compat hardware watchpoint reporting

I'm not sure what I was on when I wrote this, but when iterating over
the hardware watchpoint array (hbp_watch_array), our index is off by
ARM_MAX_BRP, so we walk off the end of our thread_struct...

... except, a dodgy condition in the loop means that it never executes
at all (bp cannot be NULL).

This patch fixes the code so that we remove the bp check and use the
correct index for accessing the watchpoint structures.
