ARM: 8127/1: module: add support for R_ARM_TARGET1 relocations

Kernel module build with GCOV profiling fails to load with the
following error:

 $ insmod test_module.ko
   test_module: unknown relocation: 38
   insmod: can't insert 'test_module.ko': invalid module format

This happens because constructor pointers in the .init_array section
have not supported R_ARM_TARGET1 relocation type.

Documentation (ELF for the ARM Architecture) says:
    "The relocation must be processed either in the same way as R_ARM_REL32 or
     as R_ARM_ABS32: a virtual platform must specify which method is used."

Since kernel expects to see absolute addresses in .init_array R_ARM_TARGET1
relocation type should be treated the same way as R_ARM_ABS32.
