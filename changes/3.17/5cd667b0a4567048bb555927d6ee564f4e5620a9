openvswitch: Allow each vport to have an array of 'port_id's.

In order to allow handlers directly read upcalls from datapath,
we need to support per-handler netlink socket for each vport in
datapath.  This commit makes this happen.  Also, it is guaranteed
to be backward compatible with previous branch.
