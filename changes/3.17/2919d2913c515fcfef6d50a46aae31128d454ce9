drm/i915: Extract ringbuffer destroy & generalize alloc to take a ringbuf

More prep work: with Execlists, we are going to start creating a lot
of extra ringbuffers soon, so these functions are handy.

No functional changes.

v2: rename allocate/destroy_ring_buffer to alloc/destroy_ringbuffer_obj
because the name is more meaningful and to mirror a similar function in
the context world: i915_gem_alloc_context_obj(). Change suggested by Brad
Volkin.
