gpio / ACPI: Use pin index and bit length

Fix code when the operation region callback is for an gpio, which
is not at index 0 and for partial pins in a GPIO definition.
For example:
Name (GMOD, ResourceTemplate ()
{
	//3 Outputs that define the Power mode of the device
	GpioIo (Exclusive, PullDown, , , , "\\_SB.GPI2") {10, 11, 12}
	})
}

If opregion callback calls is for:
- Set pin 10, then address = 0 and bit length = 1
- Set pin 11, then address = 1 and bit length = 1
- Set for both pin 11 and pin 12, then address = 1, bit length = 2

This change requires updated ACPICA gpio operation handler code to
send the pin index and bit length.
