timekeeping: Fixup typo in update_vsyscall_old definition

In commit 4a0e637738f0 ("clocksource: Get rid of cycle_last"),
currently in the -tip tree, there was a small typo where cycles_t
was used intstead of cycle_t. This broke ppc64 builds.

Fix this by using the proper cycle_t type for this usage, in
both the definition and the ia64 implementation.

Now, having both cycle_t and cycles_t types seems like a very
bad idea just asking for these sorts of issues. But that
will be a cleanup for another day.
