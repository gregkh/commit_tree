iwlwifi: mvm: disable beacon filtering escape timer in d0i3

The beacon filtering configuration in d0i3 currently uses
the max value defined as 1024. However, with beacon interval
of 100ms we end up with too-frequent wakeups.

Instead, configure the escape timer to 0, asking the fw
to disable it altogether.
