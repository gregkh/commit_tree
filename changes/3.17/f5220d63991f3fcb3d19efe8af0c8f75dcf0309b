ipv4: Make IP_MULTICAST_ALL and IP_MSFILTER work on raw sockets

Currently, although IP_MULTICAST_ALL and IP_MSFILTER ioctl calls succeed on
raw sockets, there is no code to implement the functionality on received
packets; it is only implemented for UDP sockets. The raw(7) man page states:
"In addition, all ip(7) IPPROTO_IP socket options valid for datagram sockets
are supported", which implies these ioctls should work on raw sockets.

To fix this, add a call to ip_mc_sf_allow on raw sockets.

This should not break any existing code, since the current position of
not calling ip_mc_sf_filter makes it behave as if neither the IP_MULTICAST_ALL
nor the IP_MSFILTER ioctl had been called. Adding the call to ip_mc_sf_allow
will therefore maintain the current behaviour so long as IP_MULTICAST_ALL and
IP_MSFILTER ioctls are not called. Any code that currently is calling
IP_MULTICAST_ALL or IP_MSFILTER ioctls on raw sockets presumably is wanting
the filter to be applied, although no filtering will currently be occurring.
