amd-xgbe: Enable interrupts for all management counters

As the management counters reach a threshold they will generate an
interrupt so the value can be saved and the counter reset. The
current code does not enable this interrupt on all counters. This
can result in inaccurate statistics.

Update the code to enable all the counters to generate an interrupt
when its threshold is exceeded.
