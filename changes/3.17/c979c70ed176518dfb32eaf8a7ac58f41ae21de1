powerpc/powernv: Split ioda_eeh_get_state()

Function ioda_eeh_get_state() is used to fetch EEH state for PHB
or PE. We're going to support compound PE and the function becomes
more complicated with that. The patch splits the function into two
functions for PHB and PE cases separately to improve readability.
