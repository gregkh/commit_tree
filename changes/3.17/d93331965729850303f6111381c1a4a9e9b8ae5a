ipv6: Allow accepting RA from local IP addresses.

This can be used in virtual networking applications, and
may have other uses as well.  The option is disabled by
default.

A specific use case is setting up virtual routers, bridges, and
hosts on a single OS without the use of network namespaces or
virtual machines.  With proper use of ip rules, routing tables,
veth interface pairs and/or other virtual interfaces,
and applications that can bind to interfaces and/or IP addresses,
it is possibly to create one or more virtual routers with multiple
hosts attached.  The host interfaces can act as IPv6 systems,
with radvd running on the ports in the virtual routers.  With the
option provided in this patch enabled, those hosts can now properly
obtain IPv6 addresses from the radvd.
