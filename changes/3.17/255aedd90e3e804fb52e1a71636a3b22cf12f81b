kexec: use common function for kimage_normal_alloc() and kimage_crash_alloc()

kimage_normal_alloc() and kimage_crash_alloc() are doing lot of similar
things and differ only little.  So instead of having two separate
functions create a common function kimage_alloc_init() and pass it the
"flags" argument which tells whether it is normal kexec or kexec_on_panic.
 And this function should be able to deal with both the cases.

This consolidation also helps later where we can use a common function
kimage_file_alloc_init() to handle normal and crash cases for new file
based kexec syscall.
