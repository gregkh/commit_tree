i2c: s3c2410: resume the I2C controller earlier

When the wake-up is triggered by the PMIC RTC, the RTC driver is trying
to read the PMIC interrupt status over I2C and fails because the I2C
controller is not resumed yet.
Let's resume the I2C controller earlier in the _noirq phase
(as other hardwares are doing), so we can properly get the wake-up
condition.
