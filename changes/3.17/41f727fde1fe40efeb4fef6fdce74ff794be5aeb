fork/exec: cleanup mm initialization

mm initialization on fork/exec is spread all over the place, which makes
the code look inconsistent.

We have mm_init(), which is supposed to init/nullify mm's internals, but
it doesn't init all the fields it should:

 - on fork ->mmap,mm_rb,vmacache_seqnum,map_count,mm_cpumask,locked_vm
   are zeroed in dup_mmap();

 - on fork ->pmd_huge_pte is zeroed in dup_mm(), immediately before
   calling mm_init();

 - ->cpu_vm_mask_var ptr is initialized by mm_init_cpumask(), which is
   called before mm_init() on both fork and exec;

 - ->context is initialized by init_new_context(), which is called after
   mm_init() on both fork and exec;

Let's consolidate all the initializations in mm_init() to make the code
look cleaner.
