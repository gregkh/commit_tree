usb: host: uhci-grlib.c : use devm_ functions

The various devm_ functions allocate memory that is released when a
driver detaches. This patch uses devm_ioremap_resource for data
that is allocated in the probe function of a platform device and
is only freed in the remove function. The corresponding free functions
are removed and two labels are done away with. Also, linux/device.h
is added to make sure the devm_*() routine declarations are
unambiguously available.
