perf record: Always force PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUND event

The PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUND synthetic record governs queue flushing
in reporting, so it needs to be stored for any kind of event.

The lack of such periodic flushing made the tools use more memory than
needed, as the reordering was being done only after processing all
events.  This was the case when no tracepoints were in the mix.

Forcing the PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUND event to be stored for all event
types.
