ASoC: mcasp: Fix implicit BLCK divider setting

The implicit BLCK divider setting was broken by "ASoC: mcasp: don't
override bclk divider if it was provided by the machine"-patch. After
the BCLK divider is implicitly set for the first time the
mcasp->bclk_div gets a non zero value and the implicit setting is
"turned off".
