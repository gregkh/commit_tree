mlx5: Adjust events to use unsigned long param instead of void *

In the event flow, we currently pass only a port number in the
void *data argument.  Rather than pass a pointer to the event handlers,
we should use an "unsigned long" parameter, and pass the port number
value directly.

In the future, if necessary for some events, we can use the unsigned long
parameter to pass a pointer.
