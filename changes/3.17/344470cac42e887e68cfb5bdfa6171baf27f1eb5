proc: Point /proc/mounts at /proc/thread-self/mounts instead of /proc/self/mounts

In oddball cases where the thread has a different mount namespace than
the thread group leader or more likely in cases where the thread
remains and the thread group leader has exited this ensures that
/proc/mounts continues to work.

This should not cause any problems but if it does this patch can just
be reverted.
