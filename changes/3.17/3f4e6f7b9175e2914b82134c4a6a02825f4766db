mmc: mmci: add explicit clk control

On Controllers like Qcom SD card controller where cclk is mclk and mclk should
be directly controlled by the driver.

This patch adds support to control mclk directly in the driver, and also
adds explicit_mclk_control flag in variant structure giving more flexibility
to the driver.
