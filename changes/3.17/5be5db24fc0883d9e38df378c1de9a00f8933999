HID: hid-sensor-hub: use devm_ functions consistently

Use devm_kzalloc for all calls to kzalloc and not just the first.  Use
devm functions for other allocations as well. The calls to free the
allocated memory in the probe and remove functions are done away with
and a label is removed in the probe function.

The semantic match that finds the inconsistency is as follows:

// <smpl>
@@
@@

*devm_kzalloc(...)
...
*kzalloc(...)
// </smpl>
