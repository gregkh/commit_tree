mm: softdirty: addresses before VMAs in PTE holes aren't softdirty

In PTE holes that contain VM_SOFTDIRTY VMAs, unmapped addresses before
VM_SOFTDIRTY VMAs are reported as softdirty by /proc/pid/pagemap.  This
bug was introduced in commit 68b5a6524856 ("mm: softdirty: respect
VM_SOFTDIRTY in PTE holes").  That commit made /proc/pid/pagemap look at
VM_SOFTDIRTY in PTE holes but neglected to observe the start of VMAs
returned by find_vma.

Tested:
  Wrote a selftest that creates a PMD-sized VMA then unmaps the first
  page and asserts that the page is not softdirty. I'm going to send the
  pagemap selftest in a later commit.
