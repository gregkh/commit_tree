drm/i915/bdw: collect semaphore error state

Since the semaphore information is in an object, just dump it, and let
the user parse it later.

NOTE: The page being used for the semaphores are incoherent with the
CPU. No matter what I do, I cannot figure out a way to read anything but
0s. Note that the semaphore waits are indeed working.

v2: Don't print signal, and wait (they should be the same). Instead,
print sync_seqno (Chris)

v3: Free the semaphore error object (Chris)

v4: Fix semaphore offset calculation during error state collection
(Ville)

v5: VCS2 rebase
Make semaphore object error capture coding style consistent (Ville)
Do the proper math for the signal offset (Ville)

v6: Fix small conflicts on rebase and s/ring_buffer/engine_cs (Rodrigo)
