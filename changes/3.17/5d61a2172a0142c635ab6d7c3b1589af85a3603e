powerpc/nohash: Split __early_init_mmu() into boot and secondary

__early_init_mmu() does some things that are really only needed by the
boot cpu.  On FSL booke, This includes calling
memblock_enforce_memory_limit(), which is labelled __init.  Secondary
cpu init code can't be __init as that would break CPU hotplug.

While it's probably a bug that memblock_enforce_memory_limit() isn't
__init_memblock instead, there's no reason why we should be doing this
stuff for secondary cpus in the first place.
