[media] Kconfig: do not select SPI bus on sub-driver auto-select

We should not select SPI bus when sub-driver auto-select is
selected. That option is meant for auto-selecting all possible
ancillary drivers used for selected board driver. Ancillary
drivers should define needed dependencies itself.

I2C and I2C_MUX are still selected here for a reason described on
