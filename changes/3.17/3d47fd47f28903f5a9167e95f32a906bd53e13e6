drm/msm/mdp5: add support for MDP5 v1.3

MDP5 has several functional blocks (ie: VIG/RGB pipes, LMs, ...).
From one revision to another, these blocks' base addresses might
change due to the number of instances present in the MDP5 hw.
A way of dealing with these offset changes is to introduce
dynamic offsets 'per block'.

This change adds support for the new revision of MDP5: v1.3.
The idea is to define one hw config per MDP version and select
either one of them at runtime, after reading the MDP5 version.

Once the MDP version is known, 'per block' dynamic offsets
are initialized through a global pointer, which is then used for
read/write register access.
