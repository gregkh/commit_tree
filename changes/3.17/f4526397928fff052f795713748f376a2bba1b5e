xfs: support a union-based filter for eofblocks scans

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

The eofblocks scan inode filter uses intersection logic by default.
E.g., specifying both user and group quota ids filters out inodes that
are not covered by both the specified user and group quotas. This is
suitable for behavior exposed to userspace.

Scans that are initiated from within the kernel might require more broad
semantics, such as scanning all inodes under each quota associated with
an inode to alleviate low free space conditions in each.

Create the XFS_EOF_FLAGS_UNION flag to support a conditional union-based
filtering algorithm for eofblocks scans. This flag is intentionally left
out of the valid mask as it is not supported for scans initiated from
userspace.
