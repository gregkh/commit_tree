tcp: tcp_v[46]_conn_request: fix snt_synack initialization

Commit 016818d07 (tcp: TCP Fast Open Server - take SYNACK RTT after
completing 3WHS) changes the code to only take a snt_synack timestamp
when a SYNACK transmit or retransmit succeeds. This behaviour is later
broken by commit 843f4a55e (tcp: use tcp_v4_send_synack on first
SYN-ACK), as snt_synack is now updated even if tcp_v4_send_synack
fails.

Also, commit 3a19ce0ee (tcp: IPv6 support for fastopen server) misses
the required IPv6 updates for 016818d07.

This patch makes sure that snt_synack is updated only when the SYNACK
trasnmit/retransmit succeeds, for both IPv4 and IPv6.
