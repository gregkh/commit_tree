of/irq: Fix lookup to use 'interrupts-extended' property first

In case the Device Tree blob passed by the boot agent supplies both an
'interrupts-extended' and an 'interrupts' property in order to allow for
older kernels to be usable, prefer the new-style 'interrupts-extended'
property which conveys a lot more information.

This allows us to have bootloaders willingly maintaining backwards
compatibility with older kernels without entirely deprecating the
'interrupts' property.

Update the bindings documentation to describe a situation where both the
'interrupts-extended' and the 'interrupts' property are present, and
which one takes precedence over the other.
