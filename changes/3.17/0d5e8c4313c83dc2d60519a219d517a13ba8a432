[media] Fix 64-bit division fall-out from 64-bit control ranges

Commit 0ba2aeb6dab80920edd9cf5b93b1ea4d6913b8f3 increased the internal control ranges
to 64 bit, but that caused problems in drivers that use the minimum/maximum/step/default_value
control values in a division or modulus operations since not all architectures support
those natively.

Luckily, in almost all cases it is possible to just cast to 32 bits (the control value
is known to be 32 bits, so it is safe to cast). Only in v4l2-ctrls.c was it necessary to
use do_div in one function.
