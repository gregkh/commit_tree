powerpc: remove duplicate definition of TEXASR_FS

It appears that commits 7f06f21d40a6 ("powerpc/tm: Add checking to
treclaim/trechkpt") and e4e38121507a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add
transactional memory support") both added definitions of TEXASR_FS.
Remove one of them. At the same time, fix the alignment of the remaining
definition (should be tab-separated like the rest of the #defines).
