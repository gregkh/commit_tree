trace: Fix epoll hang when we race with new entries

Epoll on trace_pipe can sometimes hang in a weird case.  If the ring buffer is
empty when we set waiters_pending but an event shows up exactly at that moment
we can miss being woken up by the ring buffers irq work.  Since
ring_buffer_empty() is inherently racey we will sometimes think that the buffer
is not empty.  So we don't get woken up and we don't think there are any events
even though there were some ready when we added the watch, which makes us hang.
This patch fixes this by making sure that we are actually on the wait list
before we set waiters_pending, and add a memory barrier to make sure
ring_buffer_empty() is going to be correct.
