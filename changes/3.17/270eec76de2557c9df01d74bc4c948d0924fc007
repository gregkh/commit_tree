xtensa: support highmem in aliasing cache flushing code

Use __flush_invalidate_dcache_page_alias with alias set to color of the
page physical address instead of __flush_invalidate_dcache_page: this
works for high memory pages and mapping/unmapping to the TLBTEMP area is
virtually free.

Allow building configurations with aliasing cache and highmem enabled.
