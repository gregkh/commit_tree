net/mlx4_en: Fix mac_hash database inconsistency

Using a local copy of dev_addr in mlx4_en_set_mac() to prevent dev_addr
from being modified during error flow or when dev_addr is modified in
another context (which is another problem that is being discussed over
the mailing list [1]).
Also fixing bad naming of priv->prev_mac into priv->current_mac.
