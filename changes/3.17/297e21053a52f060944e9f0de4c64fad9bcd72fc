KVM: Give IRQFD its own separate enabling Kconfig option

Currently, the IRQFD code is conditional on CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQ_ROUTING.
So that we can have the IRQFD code compiled in without having the
IRQ routing code, this creates a new CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD, makes
the IRQFD code conditional on it instead of CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQ_ROUTING,
and makes all the platforms that currently select HAVE_KVM_IRQ_ROUTING
also select HAVE_KVM_IRQFD.
