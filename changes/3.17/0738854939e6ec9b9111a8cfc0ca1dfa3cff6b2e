blk-merge: fix blk_recount_segments

QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE is set at default for blk-mq devices,
so bio->bi_phys_segment computed may be bigger than
queue_max_segments(q) for blk-mq devices, then drivers will
fail to handle the case, for example, BUG_ON() in
virtio_queue_rq() can be triggerd for virtio-blk:

This patch fixes the issue by ignoring the QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE
flag if the computed bio->bi_phys_segment is bigger than
queue_max_segments(q), and the regression is caused by commit
05f1dd53152173(block: add queue flag for disabling SG merging).
