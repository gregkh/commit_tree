Bluetooth: Add quirk for invalid controller address setting

When a Bluetooth controller does not have a valid public Bluetooth
address, then allow the driver to indicate this. If the quirk is
set, the Bluetooth core will switch to unconfigured state first
and will allow userspace to configure the address before starting
the full initialization of the controller.
