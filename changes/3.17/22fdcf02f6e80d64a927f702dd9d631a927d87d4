lockdep: Revert lockdep check in raw_seqcount_begin()

This commit reverts the addition of lockdep checking to raw_seqcount_begin
for the following reasons:

 1) It violates the naming convention that raw_* functions should not
    do lockdep checks (a convention that is also followed by the other
    raw_*_seqcount_begin functions).

 2) raw_seqcount_begin does not spin, so it can only be part of an ABBA
    deadlock in very special circumstances (for instance if a lock
    is held across the entire raw_seqcount_begin()+read_seqcount_retry()
    loop while also being taken inside the write_seqcount protected area).

 3) It is causing false positives with some existing callers, and there
    is no non-lockdep alternative for those callers to use.

None of the three existing callers (__d_lookup_rcu, netdev_get_name, and
the NFS state code) appear to use the function in a manner that is ABBA
deadlock prone.
