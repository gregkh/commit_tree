mfd: wm8994: Add a bunch of missing defaults/readables

Ever since this commit:

commit d4807ad2c4c0e17b6f00e3be9492c81de0804f40
regmap: Check readable regs in _regmap_read

Regmap will refuse to read a register which is not marked as readable,
this has highlighted a number of controls in this driver which are not
marked as readable/missing defaults.

This patch corrects the situation, by adding the missing
readables/defaults.
