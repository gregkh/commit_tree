drm/i915: gen specific ring init

Gen8 has already had some differentiation with how it handles rings.
Semaphores bring yet more differences, and now is as good a time as any
to do the split.

Also, since gen8 doesn't actually use semaphores up until this point,
put the proper "NULL" values in for the mbox info.

v2: v1 had a stale commit message

v3: Move everything in the is_semaphore_enabled() check

v4: VCS2 rebase
Remove double assignment of signal in render ring (Ville)

v5: Adding missed VCS2 signal init on gen8+ (Rodrigo)
