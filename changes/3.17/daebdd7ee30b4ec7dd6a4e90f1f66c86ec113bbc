HID: rmi: print an error if F11 is not found instead of stopping the device

Currently rmi_probe will return -EIO if the device doesn't report that it has F11.
This would indicate that something happened and the device is in the bootloader.
We can recover the device using a userspace firmware update tool, but it needs
access to the device through the hidraw device file. If the probe returns -EIO
the hidraw device won't be created. So instead of failing the probe, just print
an error message, but leave the device accessible from userspace.
