PCI: Keep original resource if we fail to expand it

If we have space assigned to a resource, we try to expand the resource
(e.g., to accommodate SR-IOV resources), and the expansion attempt fails,
we should keep the original assignment.

After bd064f0a231a ("PCI: Mark resources as IORESOURCE_UNSET if we can't
assign them"), we left the resource marked IORESOURCE_UNSET when the
expansion failed, even if it had originally been set.  That caused errors
like this:

  pci 0003:00:00.0: can't enable device: BAR 15 [mem size 0x0c000000 64bit pref] not assigned
  pci 0003:00:00.0: Error enabling bridge (-22), continuing

Fix this by restoring the original flags when reassignment fails.
