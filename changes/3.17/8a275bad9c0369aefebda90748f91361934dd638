iwlwifi: mvm: reset beacon filtering and BT Coex data upon FW restart

When the firmware asserts, we restart the device and reset
the relevant data we hold in the driver. BT Coex data was
not reset and because of that, the driver wouldn't
reconfigure the firmware properly after firmware restart.
Same for beacon filtering. Fix that.
