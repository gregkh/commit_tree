ARM: dts: rockchip: move oscillator input clock into main dtsi

The clock definitions get a lot shorter due to the soc clocks being handled by
rk3188-cru and only the input clock remains. These can now simply live
in the main rk3xxx.dtsi without affecting readability.

At the same time, rename the node to oscillator, adding a clock-output-names
property to match how the rk3288 handles this.
