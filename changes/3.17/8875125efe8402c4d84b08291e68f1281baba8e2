sched: Transform resched_task() into resched_curr()

We always use resched_task() with rq->curr argument.
It's not possible to reschedule any task but rq's current.

The patch introduces resched_curr(struct rq *) to
replace all of the repeating patterns. The main aim
is cleanup, but there is a little size profit too:

  (before)
	$ size kernel/sched/built-in.o
	   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
	155274	  16445	   7042	 178761	  2ba49	kernel/sched/built-in.o

	$ size vmlinux
	   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
	7411490	1178376	 991232	9581098	 92322a	vmlinux

  (after)
	$ size kernel/sched/built-in.o
	   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
	155130	  16445	   7042	 178617	  2b9b9	kernel/sched/built-in.o

	$ size vmlinux
	   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
	7411362	1178376	 991232	9580970	 9231aa	vmlinux

	I was choosing between resched_curr() and resched_rq(),
	and the first name looks better for me.

A little lie in Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt. I have not
actually collected the tracing again. With a hope the patch
won't make execution times much worse :)
