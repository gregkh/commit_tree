spi: omap2-mcspi: Configure hardware when slave driver changes mode

Commit id 2bd16e3e23d9df41592c6b257c59b6860a9cc3ea
(spi: omap2-mcspi: Do not configure the controller
on each transfer unless needed) does its job too
well so omap2_mcspi_setup_transfer() isn't called
even when an SPI slave driver changes 'spi->mode'.
The result is that the mode requested by the SPI
slave driver never takes effect.

Fix this by adding the 'mode' member to the
omap2_mcspi_cs structure which holds the mode
value that the hardware is configured for.
When the SPI slave driver changes 'spi->mode'
it will be different than the value of this new
member and the SPI master driver will know that
the hardware must be reconfigured (by calling
omap2_mcspi_setup_transfer()).
