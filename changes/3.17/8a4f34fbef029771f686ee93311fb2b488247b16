i40e: Fix a boundary condition and turning off of ntuple

When turning off ntuple with a FD table full situation,
the driver would have auto disabled FD filter additions.
Clear the auto disable flag for FD_SB so that when the
feature is turned on again using "ethtool -K ethx ntuple on"
we can start adding filters once again.
