openvswitch: Avoid memory corruption in queue_userspace_packet()

In queue_userspace_packet(), the ovs_nla_put_flow return value is
not checked. This is fine as long as key_attr_size() returns the
correct value. In case it does not, the current code may corrupt buffer
memory. Add a run time assertion catch this case to avoid silent
failure.
