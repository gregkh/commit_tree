mac80211: set auth flags after other station info

For TDLS, the AUTHORIZED flag arrives with all other important station
info (supported rates, HT/VHT caps, ...). Make sure to set the station
state in the low-level driver after transferring this information to
the mac80211 STA entry.
This aligns the STA information during sta_state callbacks with the
non-TDLS case.
