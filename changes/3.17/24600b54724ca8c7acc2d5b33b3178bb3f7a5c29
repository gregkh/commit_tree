ASoC: edma-pcm: Remove PCM_INFO_BATCH and add PCM_INFO_NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP flag

The SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH will be added back based on the dmaengine driver's
capabilities.
Patches for edma dmaengine driver has been prepared to suppress the
interrupts. We can add this flag right away and have the benefit of not
having interrupts during audio activity when the edma and ASoC patches
are in the same tree.
