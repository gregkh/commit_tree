KVM: x86: emulator injects #DB when RFLAGS.RF is set

If the RFLAGS.RF is set, then no #DB should occur on instruction breakpoints.
However, the KVM emulator injects #DB regardless to RFLAGS.RF. This patch fixes
this behavior. KVM, however, still appears not to update RFLAGS.RF correctly,
regardless of this patch.
