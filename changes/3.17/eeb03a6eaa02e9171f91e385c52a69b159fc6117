powerpc: Fail remap_4k_pfn() if PFN doesn't fit inside PTE

remap_4k_pfn() silently truncates upper bits of input 4K PFN
if it cannot be contained in PTE. This leads invalid memory mapping and could
result in a system crash when the memory is accessed. This patch fails
remap_4k_pfn() and returns -EINVAL if the input 4K PFN cannot be contained in
PTE.

V3 : Added parentheses to protect 'pfn' and entire macro as suggested by Brian.
V2 : Rewritten to avoid helper function as suggested by Stephen Rothwell.
