hwrng: create filler thread

This can be viewed as the in-kernel equivalent of hwrngd;
like FUSE it is a good thing to have a mechanism in user land,
but for some reasons (simplicity, secrecy, integrity, speed)
it may be better to have it in kernel space.

This patch creates a thread once a hwrng registers, and uses
the previously established add_hwgenerator_randomness() to feed
its data to the input pool as long as needed. A derating factor
is used to bias the entropy estimation and to disable this
mechanism entirely when set to zero.
