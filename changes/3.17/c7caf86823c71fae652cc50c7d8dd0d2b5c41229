gpio: remove gpio_ensure_requested()

gpio_ensure_requested() has been introduced in Feb. 2008 by commit
d2876d08d86f2 to force users of the GPIO API to explicitly request GPIOs
before using them.

Hopefully by now all GPIOs are correctly requested and this extra check
can be omitted ; in any case the GPIO maintainers won't feel bad if
machines start failing after 6 years of warnings.

This patch removes that function from the dark ages.
