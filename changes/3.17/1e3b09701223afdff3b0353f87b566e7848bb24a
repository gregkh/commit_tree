backlight: jornada720: Minimise code duplication and handle errors better

Rickard Strandqvi's ran a code analysis application which found that
jornada_lcd_get_contrast(() and jornada_lcd_set_contrast() contained
some code duplication (calling the same functions during various
code execution paths) and failed to return errors in a consistent
manner.  This patch aims to simplify the code, coercing it into
behaving at a level expected of a driver in the Linux kernel.
