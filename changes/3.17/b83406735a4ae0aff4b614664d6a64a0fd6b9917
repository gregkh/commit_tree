MIPS: preserve scalar FP CSR when switching vector context

Switching the vector context implicitly saves & restores the state of
the aliased scalar FP data registers, however the scalar FP control
& status register is distinct from the MSA control & status register.
In order to allow scalar FP to function correctly in programs using
MSA, the scalar CSR needs to be saved & restored along with the MSA
vector context.
