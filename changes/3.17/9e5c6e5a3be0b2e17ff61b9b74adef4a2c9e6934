powerpc/eeh: Wrong place to call pci_get_slot()

pci_get_slot() is called with hold of PCI bus semaphore and it's not
safe to be called in interrupt context. However, we possibly checks
EEH error and calls the function in interrupt context. To avoid using
pci_get_slot(), we turn into device tree for fetching location code.
Otherwise, we might run into WARN_ON() as following messages indicate:
