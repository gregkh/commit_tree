NFS: nfs4_lookup_revalidate: only evaluate parent if it will be used.

nfs4_lookup_revalidate only uses 'parent' to get 'dir', and only
uses 'dir' if 'inode == NULL'.

So we don't need to find out what 'parent' or 'dir' is until we
know that 'inode' is NULL.

By moving 'dget_parent' inside the 'if', we can reduce the number of
call sites for 'dput(parent)'.
