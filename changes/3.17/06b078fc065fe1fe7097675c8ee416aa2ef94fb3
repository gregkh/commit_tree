mm: memcontrol: rearrange charging fast path

The charging path currently starts out with OOM condition checks when
OOM is the rarest possible case.

Rearrange this code to run OOM/task dying checks only after trying the
percpu charge and the res_counter charge and bail out before entering
reclaim.  Attempting a charge does not hurt an (oom-)killed task as much
as every charge attempt having to check OOM conditions.  Also, only
check __GFP_NOFAIL when the charge would actually fail.
