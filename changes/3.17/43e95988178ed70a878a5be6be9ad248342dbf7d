xprtrdma: Limit data payload size for ALLPHYSICAL

When the client uses physical memory registration, each page in the
payload gets its own array entry in the RPC/RDMA header's chunk list.

Therefore, don't advertise a maximum payload size that would require
more array entries than can fit in the RPC buffer where RPC/RDMA
headers are built.
