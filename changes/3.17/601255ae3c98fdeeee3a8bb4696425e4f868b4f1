arm64: vdso: move data page before code pages

Andy pointed out that binutils generates additional sections in the vdso
image (e.g. section string table) which, if our .text section gets big
enough, could cross a page boundary and end up screwing up the location
where the kernel expects to put the data page.

This patch solves the issue in the same manner as x86_32, by moving the
data page before the code pages.
