tracepoint: add generic tracepoint definitions for IPI tracing

The Inter Processor Interrupt is used to make another processor do a
specific action such as rescheduling tasks, signal a timer event or
execute something in another CPU's context. IRQs are already traceable
but IPIs were not. Tracing them is useful for monitoring IPI latency,
or to verify when they are the source of CPU wake-ups with power
management implications.

Three trace hooks are defined: ipi_raise, ipi_entry and ipi_exit. To make
them portable, a string is used to identify them and correlate related
events. Additionally, ipi_raise records a bitmask representing targeted
CPUs.
