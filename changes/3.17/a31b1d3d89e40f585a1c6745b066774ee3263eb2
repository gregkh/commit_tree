xfs: add xfs_mount sysfs kobject

Embed a base kobject into xfs_mount. This creates a kobject associated
with each XFS mount and a subdirectory in sysfs with the name of the
filesystem. The subdirectory lifecycle matches that of the mount. Also
add the new xfs_sysfs.[c,h] source files with some XFS sysfs
infrastructure to facilitate attribute creation.

Note that there are currently no attributes exported as part of the
xfs_mount kobject. It exists solely to serve as a per-mount container
for child objects.
