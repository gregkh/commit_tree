iommu/core: Create central IOMMU group lookup/creation interface

Currently each IOMMU driver that supports IOMMU groups has its own
code for discovering the base device used in grouping.  This code
is generally not specific to the IOMMU hardware, but to the bus of
the devices managed by the IOMMU.  We can therefore create a common
interface for supporting devices on different buses.
