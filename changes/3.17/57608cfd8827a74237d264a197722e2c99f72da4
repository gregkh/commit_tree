perf script: Provide additional sample information on generic events

To python scripts, including pid, tid, and cpu for which the event was
recorded.

At the moment, the pointer to the sample struct is passed to scripts,
which seems to be of little use.

The patch puts this information in dictionaries for easy access by
Python scripts.
