irqchip: crossbar: Initialise the crossbar with a safe value

Since crossbar is s/w configurable, the initial settings of the
crossbar cannot be assumed to be sane. This implies that:
a) On initialization all un-reserved crossbars must be initialized to
   a known 'safe' value.
b) When unmapping the interrupt, the safe value must be written to
   ensure that the crossbar mapping matches with interrupt controller
   usage.

So provide a safe value in the dt data to map if
'0' is not safe for the platform and use it during init and unmap

While at this, fix the below checkpatch warning.
