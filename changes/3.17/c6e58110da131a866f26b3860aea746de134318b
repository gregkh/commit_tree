[media] staging: omap4iss: Fix type of struct iss_device::crashed

The crashed member of struct iss_device is documented to be a bitmask,
but a bool doesn't hold that many (usable) bits. Lines 589 and 659 of
iss.c strongly suggest that "unsigned int" was meant (the same type as
struct iss_pipeline::entities). Currently, any crashed entity will be
blamed on index 0, which is unlikely to be what was intended.
