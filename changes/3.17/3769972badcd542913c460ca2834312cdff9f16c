Bluetooth: Add a new HCI_USE_DEBUG_KEYS flag

To pave the way for actively using debug keys for pairing this patch
adds a new HCI_USE_DEBUG_KEYS flag for the purpose. When the flag is set
we issue a HCI_Write_SSP_Debug mode whenever HCI_Write_SSP_Mode(0x01)
has been issued as well as before issuing a HCI_Write_SSP_Mode(0x00)
command.
