staging: comedi: s626: remove 'set_int_src' callback from encoder private data

There are two functions used for the 'set_int_src' callback, One is used for
the channel 0-2 encoders and the other for the channel 3-5 encoders.

Refactor the two callbacks into a single s626_set_int_src() function and use
the encoder channel number to handle the differences.

Remove the then unnecessary 'set_int_src' member and just call s626_set_int_src()
drectly.
