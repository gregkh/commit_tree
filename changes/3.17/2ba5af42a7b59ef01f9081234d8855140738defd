openvswitch: fix panic with multiple vlan headers

When there are multiple vlan headers present in a received frame, the first
one is put into vlan_tci and protocol is set to ETH_P_8021Q. Anything in the
skb beyond the VLAN TPID may be still non-linear, including the inner TCI
and ethertype. While ovs_flow_extract takes care of IP and IPv6 headers, it
does nothing with ETH_P_8021Q. Later, if OVS_ACTION_ATTR_POP_VLAN is
executed, __pop_vlan_tci pulls the next vlan header into vlan_tci.

This leads to two things:

1. Part of the resulting ethernet header is in the non-linear part of the
   skb. When eth_type_trans is called later as the result of
   OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT, kernel BUGs in __skb_pull. Also, __pop_vlan_tci
   is in fact accessing random data when it reads past the TPID.

2. network_header points into the ethernet header instead of behind it.
   mac_len is set to a wrong value (10), too.
