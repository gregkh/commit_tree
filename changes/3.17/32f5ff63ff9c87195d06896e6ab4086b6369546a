KVM: s390: move finalization of SIGP STOP orders to kvm_s390_vcpu_stop

Let's move the finalization of SIGP STOP and SIGP STOP AND STORE STATUS orders to
the point where the VCPU is actually stopped.

This change is needed to prepare for a user space driven VCPU state change. The
action_bits may only be cleared when setting the cpu state to STOPPED while
holding the local irq lock.
