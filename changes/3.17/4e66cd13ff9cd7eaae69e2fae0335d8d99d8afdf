hwmon: (tmp103) Fix resource leak bug in tmp103 temperature sensor driver

tmp103 temperature sensor driver registers with the hwmon framework by calling
hwmon_device_register_with_groups but does not have a .remove method to call
hwmon_device_unregister to unregister from the framework when the device is no
longer needed. Fix this by calling devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups.
