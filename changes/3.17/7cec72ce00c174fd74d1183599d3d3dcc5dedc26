[media] rc-core: don't use dynamic_pr_debug for IR_dprintk()

The hole point of IR_dprintk() is that, once a level is
given at debug parameter, all enabled IR parsers will show their
debug messages.

While converting it to dynamic_printk might be a good idea,
right now it just makes very hard to debug the drivers, as
one needs to both pass debug=1 or debug=2 to rc-core and
to use the dynamic printk to enable all the desired lines.

That doesn't make sense!

So, revert to the old way, as a single line is changed,
and the debug parameter will now work as expected.
