VFS: allow ->d_manage() to declare -EISDIR in rcu_walk mode.

In REF-walk mode, ->d_manage can return -EISDIR to indicate
that the dentry is not really a mount trap (or even a mount point)
and that any mounts or any DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT flag should be
ignored.

RCU-walk mode doesn't currently support this, so if there is a dentry
with DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT set but which shouldn't be a mount-trap,
lookup_fast() will always drop in REF-walk mode.

With this patch, an -EISDIR from ->d_manage will always cause mounts
and automounts to be ignored, both in REF-walk and RCU-walk.
