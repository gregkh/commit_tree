Input: atmel_mxt_ts - implement T44 message handling

maXTouch chips allow the reading of multiple messages in a single I2C
transaction, which reduces bus overhead and improves performance/latency. The
number of messages available to be read is given by the value in the T44
object which is located directly before the T5 object.
