regulator: core: print error value when constraints are not applied

With commit 064d5cd110f94ce41ca5681dcda8b77fa63d5b95
(regulator: core: Fix the init of DT defined fixed regulators)
We ensure that regulator must be capable of providing it's current
voltage when constraints are used, however adding the return value in
the print is a little more informative to explain the nature of the
failure involved.

So, instead of providing message such as:
smps9: failed to get the current voltage

having error value added to the message such as:
smps9: failed to get the current voltage(-22)

is a little more informative for debugging the error.
