staging: wlags49_h2: avoid PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES warnings

Using an 'if()' inside of an 'extern inline' function causes
a gcc warning when CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES is set every
time the function is called, which gets very noisy:

In file included from /git/arm-soc/drivers/staging/wlags49_h2/wl_wext.c:73:0:
drivers/staging/wlags49_h2/wl_internal.h:1035:216: warning: '______f' is static but declared in inline function 'wl_act_int_off' which is not static [enabled by default]
  if(lp->is_handling_int == WL_HANDLING_INT) {

Fortunately there is a trivial workaround, so we can avoid
the problem by making the functions in question 'static inline'
rather than 'extern inline'.
