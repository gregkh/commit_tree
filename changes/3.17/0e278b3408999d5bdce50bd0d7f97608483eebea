fotg210: Use managed interfaces for allocation of resources

This patch intoduces the use of devm_ioremap_resource instead of
request_mem_region and ioremap_nocache and removes the calls to free the
allocated memory. Some labels are removes and a new label failed
introduced to make it less specific to the context. The call to a
platform get resource with IORESOURCE_IO is removed as it allocates
memory that is not needed.
