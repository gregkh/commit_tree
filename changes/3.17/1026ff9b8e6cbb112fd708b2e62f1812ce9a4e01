ftrace/x86: Have function graph tracer use its own trampoline

The function graph trampoline is called from the function trampoline
and both do a save and restore of registers. The save of registers
done by the function trampoline when only the function graph tracer
is running is a waste of CPU cycles.

As the function graph tracer trampoline in x86 is dependent from
the function trampoline, we can call it directly when a function
is only being traced by the function graph trampoline.
