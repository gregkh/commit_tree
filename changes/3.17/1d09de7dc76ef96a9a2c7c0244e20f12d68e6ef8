MIPS: Alchemy: introduce helpers to access SYS register block.

This patch changes all absolute SYS_XY registers to offsets from the
SYS block base, prefixes them with AU1000 to avoid silent failures due
to changed addresses, and introduces helper functions to read/write
them.

No functional changes, comparing assembly of a few select functions shows
no differences.
