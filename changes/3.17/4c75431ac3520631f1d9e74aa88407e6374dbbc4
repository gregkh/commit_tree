net: prevent of emerging cross-namespace symlinks

Code manipulating sysfs symlinks on adjacent net_devices(s)
currently doesn't take into account that devices potentially
belong to different namespaces.

This patch trying to fix an issue as follows:
- check for net_ns before creating / deleting symlink.
  for now only netdev_adjacent_rename_links and
  __netdev_adjacent_dev_remove are affected, afaics
  __netdev_adjacent_dev_insert implies both net_devs
  belong to the same namespace.
- Drop all existing symlinks to / from all adj_devs before
  switching namespace and recreate them just after.
