ASoC: generic-dmaengine-pcm: Prepare formats mask for valid physical sample sizes

Based on the dma_slave_caps's addr_widths queried from the dma driver
prepare the hw.formats mask to include only formats which is supported by
the DMA engine.
In case the dma driver does not implement the slave_caps the default
assumption is that it supports 1, 2 and 4 bytes widths.
