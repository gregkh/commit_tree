staging: vt6656: put radio power off and on into correct state every time.

When radio is off bit GPIO3_INTMD should be on and off when radio is on.

Add these to the tail of vnt_radio_power_off and vnt_radio_power_on
and remove variable bHWRadioOff.

In device_init_registers just check GPIO3_DATA are in correct state and
always power on.
