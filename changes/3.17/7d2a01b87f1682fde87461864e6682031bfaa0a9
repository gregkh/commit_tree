PCI: Add pci_fixup_suspend_late quirk pass

Add pci_fixup_suspend_late as a new pci_fixup_pass. The pass is called
from suspend_noirq and poweroff_noirq. Using the same pass for suspend
and hibernate is consistent with resume_early which is called by
resume_noirq and restore_noirq.

The new quirk pass is required for Thunderbolt support on Apple
hardware.
