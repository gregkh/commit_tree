[media] Remove checks of struct member addresses

This removes checks of struct member addresses since they likely result
in the condition always being true. Also in the stb6100_get_bandwidth
and tda8261_get_bandwidth functions the pointers frontend_ops and
tuner_ops are assigned the same addresses twice.
