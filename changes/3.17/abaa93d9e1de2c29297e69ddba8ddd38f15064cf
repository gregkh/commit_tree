rcu: Simplify priority boosting by putting rt_mutex in rcu_node

RCU priority boosting currently checks for boosting via a pointer in
task_struct.  However, this is not needed: As Oleg noted, if the
rt_mutex is placed in the rcu_node instead of on the booster's stack,
the boostee can simply check it see if it owns the lock.  This commit
makes this change, shrinking task_struct by one pointer and the kernel
by thirteen lines.
