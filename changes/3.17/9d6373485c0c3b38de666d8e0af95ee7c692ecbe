ARM: mvebu: Don't apply the thermal quirk if the SoC revision is unknown

Currently, the thermal quirk is skipped only if the SoC revision is known to be
one that does not need them, but if the SoC revision cannot be obtained, the
quirk is applied assuming it's needed.

However, this quirk must be applied only we are sure the SoC needs it, for it
breaks the thermal support if applied on a SoC that doesn't need it. The reason
for this is that the quirk consists in changing the thermal devicetree
compatible string and register offsets, to workaround a hardware bug in the
early SoC revision.

Such changes are wrong if the SoC is a new revision and doesn't need
the workaround. Therefore, this commit changes the behavior, by
requiring the SoC revision to be known in order to peform a quirk.
