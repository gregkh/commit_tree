timerfd: Implement timerfd_ioctl method to restore timerfd_ctx::ticks, v3

The read() of timerfd files allows to fetch the number of timer ticks
while there is no way to set it back from userspace.

To restore the timer's state as it was at checkpoint moment we need
a path to bring @ticks back. Initially I thought about writing ticks
back via write() interface but it seems such API is somehow obscure.

Instead implement timerfd_ioctl() method with TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS
command which allows to adjust @ticks into non-zero value waking
up the waiters.

I wrapped code with CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE which can be
dropped off if there users except c/r camp appear.

v2 (by akpm@):
 - Use define timerfd_ioctl NULL for non c/r config

v3:
 - Use copy_from_user for @ticks fetching since
   not all arch support get_user for 8 byte argument
