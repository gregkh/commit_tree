rcu: Allow for NULL tick_nohz_full_mask when nohz_full= missing

If there isn't a nohz_full= kernel parameter specified, then
tick_nohz_full_mask can legitimately be NULL.  This can cause
problems when RCU's boot code tries to cpumask_or() this value into
rcu_nocb_mask.  In addition, if NO_HZ_FULL_ALL=y, there is no point
in doing the cpumask_or() in the first place because this will cause
RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL=y, which in turn will have all bits already set in
rcu_nocb_mask.

This commit therefore avoids the cpumask_or() if NO_HZ_FULL_ALL=y
and checks for !tick_nohz_full_running otherwise, this latter check
catching cases when there was no nohz_full= kernel parameter specified.
