Input: wacom - use a uniq name for the battery device

The current implementation uses "wacom_battery" as a generic name for
batteries. This prevents us to have two Wacom devices with a battery
attached as the power system will complain about the name which is already
registered.

Use an incremental name for each battery attached.
