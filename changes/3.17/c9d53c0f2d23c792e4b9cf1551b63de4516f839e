devres: remove devm_request_and_ioremap()

devm_request_and_ioremap() was obsoleted by the commit 7509657
("lib: devres: Introduce devm_ioremap_resource()") and has been
deprecated for a long time. So, let's remove this function.
In addition, all usages of devm_request_and_ioremap() are also
removed.
