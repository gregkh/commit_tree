s390/3215: fix tty output containing tabs

git commit 37f81fa1f63ad38e16125526bb2769ae0ea8d332
"n_tty: do O_ONLCR translation as a single write"
surfaced a bug in the 3215 device driver. In combination this
broke tab expansion for tty ouput.

The cause is an asymmetry in the behaviour of tty3215_ops->write
vs tty3215_ops->put_char. The put_char function scans for '\t'
but the write function does not.

As the driver has logic for the '\t' expansion remove XTABS
from c_oflag of the initial termios as well.
