ASoC: wm5102: Convert snd_kcontrol_chip to snd_soc_kcontrol_codec

Controls for shaping the ultrasonic frequency response were introduced
in this commit:

commit 720630c002ffc7b0fa2ed5b3f4bfb36fd8f87ca6
ASoC: wm5102: Add controls to allow shaping of ultrasonic response

However, they mistakenly used snd_kcontrol_chip instead of
snd_soc_kcontrol_codec, which has replaced it now the framework is
moving to componentisation. This patch fixes this.
