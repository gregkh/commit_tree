netlink: hold nl_sock_hash_lock during diag dump

Although RCU protection would be possible during diag dump, doing
so allows for concurrent table mutations which can render the
in-table offset between individual Netlink messages invalid and
thus cause legitimate sockets to be skipped in the dump.

Since the diag dump is relatively low volume and consistency is
more important than performance, the table mutex is held during
dump.
