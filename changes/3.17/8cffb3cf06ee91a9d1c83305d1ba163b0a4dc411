staging: vt6656: Remove rx handing from RXvWorkItem

In s_nsBulkInUsbIoCompleteRead reuse or reallocate sb_buff and resubmit
urb.

In device_alloc_bufs allocate memory to rcb individually and
call PIPEnsBulkInUsbRead to submit the urbs

Change handling to free rcb in device_free_rx_bufs

Remove calls to workqueue.
