efi: Use early_mem*() instead of early_io*()

Use early_mem*() instead of early_io*() because all mapped EFI regions
are memory (usually RAM but they could also be ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash,
etc.) not I/O regions. Additionally, I/O family calls do not work correctly
under Xen in our case. early_ioremap() skips the PFN to MFN conversion
when building the PTE. Using it for memory will attempt to map the wrong
machine frame. However, all artificial EFI structures created under Xen
live in dom0 memory and should be mapped/unmapped using early_mem*() family
calls which map domain memory.
