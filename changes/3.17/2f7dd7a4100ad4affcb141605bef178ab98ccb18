mm: memcontrol: do not iterate uninitialized memcgs

The cgroup iterators yield css objects that have not yet gone through
css_online(), but they are not complete memcgs at this point and so the
memcg iterators should not return them.  Commit d8ad30559715 ("mm/memcg:
iteration skip memcgs not yet fully initialized") set out to implement
exactly this, but it uses CSS_ONLINE, a cgroup-internal flag that does
not meet the ordering requirements for memcg, and so the iterator may
skip over initialized groups, or return partially initialized memcgs.

The cgroup core can not reasonably provide a clear answer on whether the
object around the css has been fully initialized, as that depends on
controller-specific locking and lifetime rules.  Thus, introduce a
memcg-specific flag that is set after the memcg has been initialized in
css_online(), and read before mem_cgroup_iter() callers access the memcg
members.
