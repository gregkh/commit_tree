net: xgene: fix possible NULL dereference in xgene_enet_free_desc_rings()

A NULL pointer dereference is possible for the argument ring->buf_pool
which is passed to xgene_enet_free_desc_ring(), as ring could be NULL.

And now since NULL pointers are being checked for before the calls to
xgene_enet_free_desc_ring(), might as well take advantage of them and
not call the function if the argument would be NULL.
