nfs: fix nonblocking calls to nfs_page_group_lock

nfs_page_group_lock was calling wait_on_bit_lock even when told not to
block. Fix by first trying test_and_set_bit, followed by wait_on_bit_lock
if and only if blocking is allowed.  Return -EAGAIN if nonblocking and the
test_and_set of the bit was already locked.
