hrtimer: Cleanup hrtimer accessors to the timekepeing state

Rather then having two similar but totally different implementations
that provide timekeeping state to the hrtimer code, try to unify the
two implementations to be more simliar.

Thus this clarifies ktime_get_update_offsets to
ktime_get_update_offsets_now and changes get_xtime...  to
ktime_get_update_offsets_tick.
