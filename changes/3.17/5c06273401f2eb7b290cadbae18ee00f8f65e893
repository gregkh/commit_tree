virtio: rng: delay hwrng_register() till driver is ready

Instead of calling hwrng_register() in the probe routing, call it in the
scan routine.  This ensures that when hwrng_register() is successful,
and it requests a few random bytes to seed the kernel's pool at init,
we're ready to service that request.

This will also enable us to remove the workaround added previously to
check whether probe was completed, and only then ask for data from the
host.  The revert follows in the next commit.

There's a slight behaviour change here on unsuccessful hwrng_register().
Previously, when hwrng_register() failed, the probe() routine would
fail, and the vqs would be torn down, and driver would be marked not
initialized.  Now, the vqs will remain initialized, driver would be
marked initialized as well, but won't be available in the list of RNGs
available to hwrng core.  To fix the failures, the procedure remains the
same, i.e. unload and re-load the module, and hope things succeed the
next time around.
