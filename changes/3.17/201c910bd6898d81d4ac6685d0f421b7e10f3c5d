of: Transactional DT support.

Introducing DT transactional support.

A DT transaction is a method which allows one to apply changes
in the live tree, in such a way that either the full set of changes
take effect, or the state of the tree can be rolled-back to the
state it was before it was attempted. An applied transaction
can be rolled-back at any time.
