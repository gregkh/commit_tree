GenWQE: Add support for EEH error recovery

This patch implements the callbacks and functions necessary to have EEH
recovery support.

It adds a config option to enable or disable explicit calls to trigger
platform specific mechanisms on error recovery paths. This option is
enabled by default only on PPC64 systems and can be overritten via
debugfs. If this option is enabled, on the error recovery path the
driver will call pci_channel_offline() to check for error condition and
issue non-raw MMIO reads to trigger early EEH detection in case of
hardware failures. This is necessary since the driver MMIO helper
funtions use raw accessors.
