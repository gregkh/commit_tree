ARM: shmobile: r8a7779 dtsi: Correct #address-cells/#size-cells for clocks

Warning (ranges_format): /clocks has empty "ranges" property but its #address-cells (2) differs from / (1)
Warning (ranges_format): /clocks has empty "ranges" property but its #size-cells (2) differs from / (1)

As r8a7779 doesn't support LPAE, change #address-cells and #size-cells from
"<2>" to "<1>", and update the affected "reg" properties to fix this.
