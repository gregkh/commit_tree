net/mlx4_core: Allow not to specify probe_vf in SRIOV IB mode

When the HCA is configured in SRIOV IB mode (that is, at least one of
the ports is IB) and the probe_vf module param isn't specified,
mlx4_init_one() failed because of the following condition:

if (ib_ports && (num_vfs_argc > 1 || probe_vfs_argc > 1)) {
	 .....
}

The root cause for that is a mistake in the initialization of num_vfs_argc
and probe_vfs_argc. When num_vfs / probe_vf aren't given, their argument
count counterpart should be 0, fix that.
