KVM: emulate: protect checks on ctxt->d by a common "if (unlikely())"

There are several checks for "peculiar" aspects of instructions in both
x86_decode_insn and x86_emulate_insn.  Group them together, and guard
them with a single "if" that lets the processor quickly skip them all.
Make this more effective by adding two more flag bits that say whether the
.intercept and .check_perm fields are valid.  We will reuse these
flags later to avoid initializing fields of the emulate_ctxt struct.

This skims about 30 cycles for each emulated instructions, which is
approximately a 3% improvement.
