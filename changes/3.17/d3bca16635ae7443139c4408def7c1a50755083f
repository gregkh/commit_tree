iommu/arm-smmu: fix capability checking prior to device attach

If somebody attempts to check the capability of an IOMMU domain prior to
device attach, then we'll try to dereference a NULL SMMU pointer through
the SMMU domain (since we can't determine the actual SMMU instance until
we have a device attached).

This patch fixes the capability check so that non-global features are
reported as being absent when no device is attached to the domain.
