NFC: digital: Check for NFC-DEP before checking for Type 4 tag

In digital_in_recv_sel_res(), the code that determines
the tag type will interpret bits 7:6 (lsb being b1 as
per the Digital Specification) of a SEL RES set to 11b
as a Type 4 tag.  This is okay except that the neard
will interpret the same value as an NFC-DEP device
(in src/tag.c:set_tag_type() in the neard source).

Make the digital layer's interpretation match neard's
interpretation by changing the order of the checks in
digital_in_recv_sel_res() so that a value of 11b in
bits 7:6 is interpreted as an NFC-DEP device instead
of a Type 4 tag.
