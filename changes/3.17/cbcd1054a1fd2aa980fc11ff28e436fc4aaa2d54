bio-integrity: add "bip_max_vcnt" into struct bio_integrity_payload

Commit 08778795 ("block: Fix nr_vecs for inline integrity vectors") from
Martin introduces the function bip_integrity_vecs(get the useful vectors)
to fix the issue about nr_vecs for inline integrity vectors that reported
by David Milburn.

But it seems that bip_integrity_vecs() will return the wrong number if the
bio is not based on any bio_set for some reason(bio->bi_pool == NULL),
because in that case, the bip_inline_vecs[0] is malloced directly.  So
here we add the bip_max_vcnt to record the count of vector slots, and
cleanup the function bip_integrity_vecs().
