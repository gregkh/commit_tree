usb: gadget: f_fs: fix the redundant ep files problem

Up to now, when endpoint addresses in descriptors were non-consecutive,
there were created redundant files, which could cause problems in kernel,
when user tried to read/write to them. It was result of fact that maximum
endpoint address was taken as total number of endpoints in function.

This patch adds endpoint descriptors counting and storing their addresses
in eps_addrmap to verify their cohesion in each speed.

Endpoint address map would be also useful for further features, just like
vitual endpoint address mapping.
