ARM: tegra: roth: fix unsupported pinmux properties

The pinmux subsystem complained that the nvidia,low-power-mode property
is not supported by the sdio1, sdio3 and gma drive groups. In addition
gma also does not support nvidia,drive-type. Remove these properties so
the pinmux configuration can properly be applied.
