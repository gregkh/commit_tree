KVM: x86: do not check CS.DPL against RPL during task switch

This reverts the check added by commit 5045b468037d (KVM: x86: check CS.DPL
against RPL during task switch, 2014-05-15).  Although the CS.DPL=CS.RPL
check is mentioned in table 7-1 of the SDM as causing a #TSS exception,
it is not mentioned in table 6-6 that lists "invalid TSS conditions"
which cause #TSS exceptions. In fact it causes some tests to fail, which
pass on bare-metal.

Keep the rest of the commit, since we will find new uses for it in 3.18.
