arm64: KVM: allow export and import of generic timer regs

For correct guest suspend/resume behaviour we need to ensure we include
the generic timer registers for 64 bit guests. As CONFIG_KVM_ARM_TIMER is
always set for arm64 we don't need to worry about null implementations.
However I have re-jigged the kvm_arm_timer_set/get_reg declarations to
be in the common include/kvm/arm_arch_timer.h headers.
