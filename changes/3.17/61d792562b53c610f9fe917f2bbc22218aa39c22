vfio-pci: Use mutex around open, release, and remove

Serializing open/release allows us to fix a refcnt error if we fail
to enable the device and lets us prevent devices from being unbound
or opened, giving us an opportunity to do bus resets on release.  No
restriction added to serialize binding devices to vfio-pci while the
mutex is held though.
