CMA: generalize CMA reserved area management functionality

Currently, there are two users on CMA functionality, one is the DMA
subsystem and the other is the KVM on powerpc.  They have their own code
to manage CMA reserved area even if they looks really similar.  From my
guess, it is caused by some needs on bitmap management.  KVM side wants
to maintain bitmap not for 1 page, but for more size.  Eventually it use
bitmap where one bit represents 64 pages.

When I implement CMA related patches, I should change those two places
to apply my change and it seem to be painful to me.  I want to change
this situation and reduce future code management overhead through this
patch.

This change could also help developer who want to use CMA in their new
feature development, since they can use CMA easily without copying &
pasting this reserved area management code.

In previous patches, we have prepared some features to generalize CMA
reserved area management and now it's time to do it.  This patch moves
core functions to mm/cma.c and change DMA APIs to use these functions.

There is no functional change in DMA APIs.
