net-timestamp: document deprecated syststamp

The SO_TIMESTAMPING API defines option SOF_TIMESTAMPING_SYS_HW.
This feature is deprecated. It should not be implemented by new
device drivers. Existing drivers do not implement it, either --
with one exception.

Driver developers are encouraged to expose the NIC hw clock as a
PTP HW clock source, instead, and synchronize system time to the
HW source.

The control flag cannot be removed due to being part of the ABI, nor
can the structure scm_timestamping that is returned. Due to the one
legacy driver, the internal datapath and structure are not removed.

This patch only clearly marks the interface as deprecated. Device
drivers should always return a syststamp value of zero.

We can consider adding a WARN_ON_ONCE in__sock_recv_timestamp
if non-zero syststamp is encountered
