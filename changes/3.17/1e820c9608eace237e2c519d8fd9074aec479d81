locking/mutexes: Delete the MUTEX_SHOW_NO_WAITER macro

MUTEX_SHOW_NO_WAITER() is a macro which checks for if there are
"no waiters" on a mutex by checking if the lock count is non-negative.
Based on feedback from the discussion in the earlier version of this
patchset, the macro is not very readable.

Furthermore, checking lock->count isn't always the correct way to
determine if there are "no waiters" on a mutex. For example, a negative
count on a mutex really only means that there "potentially" are
waiters. Likewise, there can be waiters on the mutex even if the count is
non-negative. Thus, "MUTEX_SHOW_NO_WAITER" doesn't always do what the name
of the macro suggests.

So this patch deletes the MUTEX_SHOW_NO_WAITERS() macro, directly
use atomic_read() instead of the macro, and adds comments which
elaborate on how the extra atomic_read() checks can help reduce
unnecessary xchg() operations.
