nilfs2: add /sys/fs/nilfs2/features group

This patchset implements creation of sysfs groups and attributes with
the purpose to show NILFS2 volume details, internal state of the driver
and to manage internal state of NILFS2 driver.

Sysfs is a virtual file system that exports information about devices
and drivers from the kernel device model to user space, and is also used
for configuration.  NILFS2 is a complex file system that has segctor
thread, GC thread, checkpoint/snapshot model and so on.  Sysfs namespace
provides native and easy way for: (1) getting info and statistics about
volume state; (2) getting info and configuration of internal subsystems
(segctor thread); (3) snapshots management.

Suggested patchset provides basis for managing segctor thread behaviour
and manipulation by snapshots.  Currently, it informs only about segctor
thread's internal parameters and about mounted snapshots.  But sysfs
interface can provide easy and simple way for deep management of segctor
thread and snapshots.

This patchset provides opportunity to manage interval of periodical
update of superblock (in seconds).  Default value is 10 seconds.  Now a
user can increase this value by means of
nilfs2/<device>/superblock/sb_update_frequency attribute in the case of
necessity.

Also the patchset provides opportunity to get information easily about
key volumes's parameters (free blocks, superblock write count,
superblock update frequency, latest segment info, dirty data blocks
count, count of clean segments, count of dirty segments and so on) in
real time manner.  Such information can be used in scripts for subtle
management of filesystem.

Implemented functionality creates such groups:
(1) /sys/fs/nilfs2 - root group
(2) /sys/fs/nilfs2/features - group contains attributes that describe NILFS
file system driver features
(3) /sys/fs/nilfs2/<device> - group contains attributes that describe file
system partition's details
(4) /sys/fs/nilfs2/<device>/superblock - group contains attributes that describe
superblock's details
(5) /sys/fs/nilfs2/<device>/segctor - group contains attributes that describe
segctor thread activity details
(6) /sys/fs/nilfs2/<device>/segments - group contains attributes that describe
details about volume's segments
(7) /sys/fs/nilfs2/<device>/checkpoints - group contains attributes that describe
details about volume's checkpoints
(8) /sys/fs/nilfs2/<device>/mounted_snapshots - group contains group for every
mounted snapshot
(9) /sys/fs/nilfs2/<device>/mounted_snapshots/<snapshot> - group contains
details about mounted snapshot

This patch (of 9):

This patch adds code of creation /sys/fs/nilfs2 group and
/sys/fs/nilfs2/features group.

The features group contains attributes that describe NILFS
file system driver features:
(1) revision - show current revision of NILFS file system driver.

There are two formats of timestamp output - seconds and human-readable
format.  Every showed timestamp has two sysfs files (time-<xxx> and
time-<xxx>-secs).  One sysfs file (time-<xxx>) shows time in
human-readable format.  Another sysfs file (time-<xxx>-secs) shows time in
seconds.

It was reported by Michael Semon that timestamp output in human-readable
format should be changed from "2014-4-12 14:5:38" to "2014-04-12
14:05:38".  Second version of the patch fixes this issue.
