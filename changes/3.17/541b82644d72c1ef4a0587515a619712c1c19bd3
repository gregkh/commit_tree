sched/core: Fix formatting issues in sched_can_stop_tick()

sched_can_stop_tick() is using 7 spaces instead of 8 spaces or a 'tab' at the
beginning of few lines. Which doesn't align well with the Coding Guidelines.

Also remove local variable 'rq' as it is used at only one place and we can
directly use this_rq() instead.
