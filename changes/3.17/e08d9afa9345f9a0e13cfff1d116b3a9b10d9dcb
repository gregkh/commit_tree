Input: synaptics - use firmware data for Cr-48

The profile sensor clickpad in a Cr-48 Chromebook does a reasonable job
of tracking individual fingers. This tracking isn't perfect, but,
experiments show that it works better than just passing "semi-mt" data
to userspace, and making userspace try to deduce where the fingers are
given a bounding box.

This patch tries to report correct two-finger positions instead of the
{(min_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y)} for profile sensor clickpads on Cr-48
chromebooks. Note that this device's firmware always reports the higher
(smaller y) finger in the "sgm" packet, and the lower (larger y) finger
in the "agm" packet. Thus, when a new finger arrives on the pad, the
kernel driver uses input core's contact tracking facilities to match
contacts with slots.
