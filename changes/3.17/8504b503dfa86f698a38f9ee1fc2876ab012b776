xtensa: support aliasing cache in kmap

Define ARCH_PKMAP_COLORING and provide corresponding macro definitions
on cores with aliasing data cache.

Instead of single last_pkmap_nr maintain an array last_pkmap_nr_arr of
pkmap counters for each page color. Make sure that kmap maps physical
page at virtual address with color matching its physical address.
