mm: memcontrol: revert use of root_mem_cgroup res_counter

Dave Hansen reports a massive scalability regression in an uncontained
page fault benchmark with more than 30 concurrent threads, which he
bisected down to 05b843012335 ("mm: memcontrol: use root_mem_cgroup
res_counter") and pin-pointed on res_counter spinlock contention.

That change relied on the per-cpu charge caches to mostly swallow the
res_counter costs, but it's apparent that the caches don't scale yet.

Revert memcg back to bypassing res_counters on the root level in order
to restore performance for uncontained workloads.
