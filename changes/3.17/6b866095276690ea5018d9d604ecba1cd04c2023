drivers/staging/bcm/Misc.c: fix a check

The issue was reported by static analysis.
The value holding flags was &-ed with 0x02, being compared to 0x01
(TRUE) after that. Such comparsion is always false.

Resolution: drop the comparsion to TRUE in the condition.

&-ing with 0x02 is right, according to result variable name
(reporting_mode) and description in drivers/staging/bcm/target_params.h
("bit 1 = 1: CINR reporting in Idlemode Msg").
