ARM: 8151/1: add missing exports for asm functions required by get_user macro

Previous commits that dealt with get_user for 64bit type missed to
export proper functions, so if get_user macro with particular target/value
types are used by kernel module modpost would produce 'undefined!' error.
Solution is to export all required functions.
