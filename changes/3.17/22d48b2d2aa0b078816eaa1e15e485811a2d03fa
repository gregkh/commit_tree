KVM: svm: writes to MSR_K7_HWCR generates GPE in guest

Since commit 575203 the MCE subsystem in the Linux kernel for AMD sets bit 18
in MSR_K7_HWCR. Running such a kernel as a guest in KVM on an AMD host results
in a GPE injected into the guest because kvm_set_msr_common returns 1. This
patch fixes this by masking bit 18 from the MSR value desired by the guest.
