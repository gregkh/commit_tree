crypto: drbg - backport "fix maximum value checks on 32 bit systems"

This is a backport of commit b9347aff91ce4789619168539f08202d8d6a1177.
This backport is needed as without it the code will crash on 32-bit
systems.
    
The maximum values for additional input string or generated blocks is
larger than 1<<32. To ensure a sensible value on 32 bit systems, return
SIZE_MAX on 32 bit systems. This value is lower than the maximum
allowed values defined in SP800-90A. The standard allow lower maximum
values, but not larger values.

SIZE_MAX - 1 is used for drbg_max_addtl to allow
drbg_healthcheck_sanity to check the enforcement of the variable
without wrapping.
