net/hsr: Fix NULL pointer dereference on incomplete hsr_newlink() params.

If none of the slave interfaces are specified, struct nlattr *data[] may
be NULL. Make sure to check for that.

While I'm at it, fix the horrible error messages displayed when only one
of the slave interfaces isn't specified.
