brcmfmac: handle IF event for P2P_DEVICE interface

The firmware notifies about interface changes through the IF event
which has a NO_IF flag that means host can ignore the event. This
behaviour was introduced in the driver by:

  commit 2ee8382fc6c763c76396a6aaff77a27089eed3aa

      brcmfmac: ignore IF event if firmware indicates it

It turns out that the IF event for the P2P_DEVICE also has this
flag set, but the event should not be ignored in this scenario.
The mentioned commit caused a regression in 3.12 kernel in creation
of the P2P_DEVICE interface.
