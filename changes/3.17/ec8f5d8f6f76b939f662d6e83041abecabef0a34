crypto: qce - Qualcomm crypto engine driver

The driver is separated by functional parts. The core part
implements a platform driver probe and remove callbaks.
The probe enables clocks, checks crypto version, initialize
and request dma channels, create done tasklet and init
crypto queue and finally register the algorithms into crypto
core subsystem.

- DMA and SG helper functions
 implement dmaengine and sg-list helper functions used by
 other parts of the crypto driver.

- ablkcipher algorithms
 implementation of AES, DES and 3DES crypto API callbacks,
 the crypto register alg function, the async request handler
 and its dma done callback function.

- SHA and HMAC transforms
 implementation and registration of ahash crypto type.
 It includes sha1, sha256, hmac(sha1) and hmac(sha256).

- infrastructure to setup the crypto hw
 contains functions used to setup/prepare hardware registers for
 all algorithms supported by the crypto block. It also exports
 few helper functions needed by algorithms:
	- to check hardware status
	- to start crypto hardware
	- to translate data stream to big endian form

 Adds register addresses and bit/masks used by the driver
 as well.
