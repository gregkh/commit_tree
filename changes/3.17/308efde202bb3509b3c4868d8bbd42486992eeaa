ARM: tegra: Add resets & has-utmi-pad-registers flag to all USB PHYs

Add new properties to all of the Tegra PHYs that are now required
according to the binding.

In order to stay compatible with old device trees, the USB drivers
will still function without these reset properties but with the old,
potentially buggy behaviour.
