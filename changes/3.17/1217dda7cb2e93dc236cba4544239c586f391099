dt: bindings: add bindings for Broadcom bcm43xx sdio devices

The Broadcom bcm43xx sdio devices are fullmac devices that may be
integrated in ARM platforms. Currently, the brcmfmac driver for
these devices support use of platform data. This patch specifies
the bindings that allow this platform data to be expressed in the
devicetree.
