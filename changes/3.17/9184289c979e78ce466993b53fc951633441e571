xtensa: deprecate fast_xtensa and fast_spill_registers syscalls

These syscalls are not used by userspace tools for some time now, and
they have issues when called with invalid arguments. It's not worth
changing signal delivery mechanism as we don't expect any new users for
these syscalls. Let's keep them for backwards compatibility under #ifdef,
disabled by default.
