nfsd: Allow lockowners to hold several stateids

A lockowner can have more than one lock stateid. For instance, if a
process has more than one file open and has locks on both, then the same
lockowner has more than one stateid associated with it. Change it so
that this reality is better reflected by the objects that nfsd uses.
