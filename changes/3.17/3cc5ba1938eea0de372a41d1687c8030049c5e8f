ntb: Add alignment check to meet hardware requirement

The NTB translate register must have the value to be BAR size aligned.
This alignment check make sure that the DMA memory allocated has the
proper alignment. Another requirement for NTB to function properly with
memory window BAR size greater or equal to 4M is to use the CMA feature
in 3.16 kernel with the appropriate CONFIG_CMA_ALIGNMENT and
CONFIG_CMA_SIZE_MBYTES set.
