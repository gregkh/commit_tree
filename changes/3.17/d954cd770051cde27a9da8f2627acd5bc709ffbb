ath9k: fix pending tx frames accounting

Packets originally buffered for the regular hardware tx queues can end
up being transmitted through the U-APSD queue (via PS-Poll or U-APSD).
When packets are dropped due to retransmit failures, the pending frames
counter is not always updated properly.
Fix this by keeping track of the queue that a frame was accounted for in
the ath_frame_info struct, and using that on completion to decide
whether the counter should be updated.
This fixes some spurious transmit queue hangs.
