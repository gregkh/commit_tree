block SG_IO: add SG_FLAG_Q_AT_HEAD flag

After the SG_IO ioctl was copied into the block layer and
later into the bsg driver, subtle differences emerged.

One difference is the way injected commands are queued through
the block layer (i.e. this is not SCSI device queueing nor SATA
NCQ). Summarizing:
  - SG_IO on block layer device: blk_exec*(at_head=false)
  - sg device SG_IO: at_head=true
  - bsg device SG_IO: at_head=true

Some time ago Boaz Harrosh introduced a sg v4 flag called
BSG_FLAG_Q_AT_TAIL to override the bsg driver default. A
recent patch titled: "sg: add SG_FLAG_Q_AT_TAIL flag"
allowed the sg driver default to be overridden. This patch
allows a SG_IO ioctl sent to a block layer device to have
its default overridden.

ChangeLog:
    - introduce SG_FLAG_Q_AT_HEAD flag in sg.h to cause
      commands that are injected via a block layer
      device SG_IO ioctl to set at_head=true
    - make comments clearer about queueing in sg.h since the
      header is used both by the sg device and block layer
      device implementations of the SG_IO ioctl.
    - introduce BSG_FLAG_Q_AT_HEAD in bsg.h for compatibility
      (it does nothing) and update comments.
