Revert "efi/x86: efistub: Move shared dependencies to <asm/efi.h>"

This reverts commit f23cf8bd5c1f ("efi/x86: efistub: Move shared
dependencies to <asm/efi.h>") as well as the x86 parts of commit
f4f75ad5741f ("efi: efistub: Convert into static library").

The road leading to these two reverts is long and winding.

The above two commits were merged during the v3.17 merge window and
turned the common EFI boot stub code into a static library. This
necessitated making some symbols global in the x86 boot stub which
introduced new entries into the early boot GOT.

The problem was that we weren't fixing up the newly created GOT entries
before invoking the EFI boot stub, which sometimes resulted in hangs or
resets. This failure was reported by Maarten on his Macbook pro.

The proposed fix was commit 9cb0e394234d ("x86/efi: Fixup GOT in all
boot code paths"). However, that caused issues for Linus when booting
his Sony Vaio Pro 11. It was subsequently reverted in commit
f3670394c29f.

So that leaves us back with Maarten's Macbook pro not booting.

At this stage in the release cycle the least risky option is to revert
the x86 EFI boot stub to the pre-merge window code structure where we
explicitly #include efi-stub-helper.c instead of linking with the static
library. The arm64 code remains unaffected.

We can take another swing at the x86 parts for v3.18.
