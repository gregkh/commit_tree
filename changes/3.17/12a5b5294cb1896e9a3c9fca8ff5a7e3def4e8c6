fix copy_tree() regression

Since 3.14 we had copy_tree() get the shadowing wrong - if we had one
vfsmount shadowing another (i.e. if A is a slave of B, C is mounted
on A/foo, then D got mounted on B/foo creating D' on A/foo shadowed
by C), copy_tree() of A would make a copy of D' shadow the the copy of
C, not the other way around.

It's easy to fix, fortunately - just make sure that mount follows
the one that shadows it in mnt_child as well as in mnt_hash, and when
copy_tree() decides to attach a new mount, check if the last child
it has added to the same parent should be shadowing the new one.
And if it should, just use the same logics commit_tree() has - put the
new mount into the hash and children lists right after the one that
should shadow it.
