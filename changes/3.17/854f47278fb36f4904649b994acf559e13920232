Bluetooth: Fix redundant encryption when receiving Security Request

If we're already encrypted with a good enough LTK we should just ignore
an incoming SMP Security Request. The code was already taking care of
this in the smp_conn_security function before calling smp_ltk_encrypt
but failed to do the same in smp_cmd_security_req. This patch fixes the
issue by moving up the smp_sufficient_security function and using it in
the Security Request handler before trying to request encryption.
