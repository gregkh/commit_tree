[media] v4l: vsp1: uds: Fix scaling of alpha layer

Pixel color components can be scaled using either bilinear interpolation
or a multitap filter. The multitap filter provides better results, but
can't be selected when the alpha layer need to be scaled down by more
than 1/2.

Disable alpha scaling when the input has a fixed alpha value, and
program the UDS to output a fixed alpha value in that case. This ensures
the multitap filter will be used whenever possible.
