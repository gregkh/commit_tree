ALSA: hda - Fix probing and stuttering on CMI8888 HD-audio controller

ASUS Phoebus with CMI8888 HD-audio chip (PCI id 13f6:5011) doesn't
work with HD-audio driver as is because of some weird nature.  For
making DMA properly working, we need to disable MSI.  The position
report buffer doesn't work, thus we need to force reading LPIB
instead.  And yet, the codec CORB/RIRB communication gives errors
unless we disable the snooping (caching).

In this patch, all these workarounds are added as a quirk for the
device.  The HD-audio *codec* chip needs yet another workaround, but
it'll be provided in the succeeding patch.
