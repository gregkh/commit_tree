flow_dissector: Use IPv6 flow label in flow_dissector

This patch implements the receive side to support RFC 6438 which is to
use the flow label as an ECMP hash. If an IPv6 flow label is set
in a packet we can use this as input for computing an L4-hash. There
should be no need to parse any transport headers in this case.
