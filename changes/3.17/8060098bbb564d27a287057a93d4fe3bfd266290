ARM: dts: Add cros_ec to exynos5420-peach-pit and exynos5800-peach-pi

This adds cros_ec to exynos5420-peach-pit and exynos5800-peach-pi,
including:
* The keyboard
* The i2c tunnel
* The tps65090 under the i2c tunnel
* The battery under the i2c tunnel

To add extra motivation, it should be noted that tps65090 is one of
the things needed to get display-related FETs turned on for pit and
pi.
