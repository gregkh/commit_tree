asus-wmi: backlight_init: Stop treating -ENODEV as if its not an error

When bl_power support got added to asus-wmi, the error handling for it was
written to ignore -ENODEV, to avoid not registering a backlight interface for
models which have no bl_power control, but do have brightness control.

At the same time the error handling for brightness_max was modified to do the
same, this is wrong, when there is no brightness_max asus-wmi should not
register a backlight interface.

Note the caller of asus_wmi_backlight_init already special cases -ENODEV,
and will not cause the wmi driver regristration to fail because of a
-ENODEV return from asus_wmi_backlight_init.
