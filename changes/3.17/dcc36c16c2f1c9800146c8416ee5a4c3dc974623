Bluetooth: Unify helpers for bdaddr_list manipulations

We already have several lists with struct bdaddr_list entries, and there
will be more in the future. Since the operations for adding, removing,
looking up and clearing entries in these lists are exactly the same it
doesn't make sense to define new functions for every single list. This
patch unifies the functions by passing the list_head to them instead of
a hci_dev pointer.
