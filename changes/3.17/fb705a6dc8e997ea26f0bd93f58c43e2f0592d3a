HID: sony: Format and comment sixaxis_rdesc

Reformat sixaxis_rdesc to reflect its HID structure, and comment each
field. This will make it easier to validate changes to the descriptor in
the future.

No functional changes are introduced, the descriptor is exactly the same
as before byte by byte.

The heavy lifting has been done with the help of hidrd-convert:
