ARM: i.MX: allow disabling supervisor protect via DT

The i.MX SoCs allow to setup fine grained access rights to peripherals on the
AIPS bus.
This is done via the Peripheral Access Register (PAR) in e.g. the i.MX21
or in later SoC versions the Off-Platform Peripheral Access Control Register
(OPACR), e.g. i.MX53.
Under certain circumstances this leads to problems in which bus masters are
not granted their access rights to peripherals.
To be able to disable these restrictions on DT platforms, add a helper function
that looks for AIPS nodes in the DT and disables them for every compatible node
it finds.
The compatible has to be declared in the mach-specific entry file, where this
helper function should then be called.
