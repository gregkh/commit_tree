ARM: shmobile: Move most of irqs.h, keep some for pinctl

Move most of irqs.h so it can be used as #include "irqs.h"
instead of the old style #include <mach/irqs.h>.

Legacy code in drivers/pinctrl needs more work to get rid
of the "mach" portion of the include path, so some part
is left in the original location.
