net: fec: ensure fec_enet_close() copes with resume failure

When the FEC is suspended, the device is detached.  Upon resume failure,
the device is left in detached mode, possibly with some of the required
clocks not running.  We don't want to be poking the device in that state
because as it may cause bus errors.

If the device is marked detached, avoid calling fec_stop().

This depends upon: "net:fec: improve safety of suspend/resume paths"
