net-timestamp: fix missing ACK timestamp

ACK timestamps are generated in tcp_clean_rtx_queue. The TSO datapath
can break out early, causing the timestamp code to be skipped. Move
the code up before the break.

Also fix a boundary condition: tp->snd_una is the next unacknowledged
byte and between tests inclusive (a <= b <= c), so generate a an ACK
timestamp if (prior_snd_una <= tskey <= tp->snd_una - 1).
