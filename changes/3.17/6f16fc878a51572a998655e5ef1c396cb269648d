irqchip: crossbar: Check for premapped crossbar before allocating

If irq_of_parse_and_map is executed twice, the same crossbar is mapped to two
different GIC interrupts. This is completely undesirable. Instead, check
if the requested crossbar event is pre-allocated and provide that GIC
mapping back to caller if already allocated.
