netlink: reset network header before passing to taps

netlink doesn't set any network header offset thus when the skb is
being passed to tap devices via dev_queue_xmit_nit(), it emits klog
false positives due to it being unset like:

  ...
  [  124.990397] protocol 0000 is buggy, dev nlmon0
  [  124.990411] protocol 0000 is buggy, dev nlmon0
  ...

So just reset the network header before passing to the device; for
packet sockets that just means nothing will change - mac and net
offset hold the same value just as before.
