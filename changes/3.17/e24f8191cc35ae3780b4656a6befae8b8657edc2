xen-netback: move netif_napi_add before binding interrupt

Interrupt is enabled when bind_interdomain_evtchn_to_irqhandler returns.
If there's interrupt pending interrupt handler is invoked.

NAPI needs to be initialised before binding interrupt otherwise the
interrupt handler will try to scheduling a NAPI instance that is not
initialised yet, resulting in kernel OOPS.

This fixes a regression introduced in ea2c5e13 ("xen-netback: move NAPI
add/remove calls").

Ideally function calls to create kthreads should also be moved before
binding but I intent to fix this regression with minimal changes and
refactor the code with another patch.
