ARM: DRA7: hwmod: Add dra74x and dra72x specific ocp interface lists

To deal with IPs which are specific to dra74x and dra72x, maintain seperate
ocp interface lists, while keeping the common list for all common IPs.

Move USB OTG SS4 to dra74x only list since its unavailable in
dra72x and is giving an abort during boot. The dra72x only list
is empty for now and a placeholder for future hwmod additions which
are specific to dra72x.
