misc: mic: add a bus driver for virtual MIC devices

This MIC virtual bus driver takes the responsibility of creating all
the virtual devices connected to the PCIe device on the host and the
platform device on the card. The MIC bus hardware operations provide
a way to abstract certain hardware details from the base physical devices.
Examples of devices added on the MIC virtual bus include host DMA and card DMA.
This abstraction enables using a common DMA driver on host and card.
