Bluetooth: Fix connecting devices during LE device discovery

If we have devices set as to be connected we should connect to them even
during normal discovery if we get a connectable advertising event. If we
also have HCI_CONNECTABLE set we should connect ADV_DIRECT_IND events
even to devices that we don't have in our pend_le_conns list. This patch
implements such behavior by passing the advertising report type to
check_pending_le_conn() and calls that function regardless of what type
of scanning we are doing.
