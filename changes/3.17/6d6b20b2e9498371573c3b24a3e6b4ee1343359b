ACPI: move models with win8 brightness problems from win8 blacklist to use_native_backlight

When the windows8 related backlight problems became evident, 2 approaches
were follow in parallel, one was to stop claiming to be windows 8 / 2012,
the other was to tell acpi_video to stop registering a backlight driver.

I've read all the threads and it seems that which approach ended up being
applied to which model laptop was never really a concious decision (AFAIK):

So lets move all the models which are only on the win8 blacklist because of
brightness issues to the use_native_backlight list, which is the smaller
hammer to use to solve the backlight issues.

Making this change is esp. attractive now that 3.16 has
video.use_native_brightness=1 by default. If that new default does not get
reverted because of regressions, then we can drop all the models
with a use_native_backlight quirk, greatly reducing the number of models we've
a quirk for.
