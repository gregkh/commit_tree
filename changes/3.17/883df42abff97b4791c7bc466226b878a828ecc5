USB: tegra: Add resets & has-utmi-pad-registers flag to the PHY binding

When Tegra was converted to use the standard reset bindings, the PHY was
forgotten, probably because all the resetting of the USB blocks were
done in the EHCI driver. What also went unnoticed is that resetting the
1st on-chip USB module also wipes some of the UTMI pad configuration
registers that are also used by the other USB blocks. So this fact needs
to be described in the device tree, and the driver modified not to reset
the 1st module at inappropriate times.

In order to stay compatible with old device trees, the USB drivers will
still function without these properties but with the old,
potentially buggy behaviour.
