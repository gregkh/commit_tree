irqchip: crossbar: Change allocation logic by reversing search for free irqs

Reverse the search algorithm to ensure that address mapping and IRQ
allocation logics are proper. This makes the below bugs visible sooner.

class 1. address space errors -> example:
reg = <a size_b>
ti,max-irqs =  is a wrong parameter

class 2: irq-reserved list - which decides which entries in the
address space is not actually wired in

class 3: wrong list of routable-irqs.

In general allocating from max to min tends to have benefits in
ensuring the different issues that may be present in dts is easily
caught at definition time, rather than at a later point in time.
