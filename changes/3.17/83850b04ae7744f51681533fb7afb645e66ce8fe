ARM: shmobile: rcar-gen2: Update for of_get_flat_dt_prop() update

Commit 9d0c4dfedd96ee54fc075b16d02f82499c8cc3a6 ("of/fdt: update
of_get_flat_dt_prop in prep for libfdt") changed the function prototypes
of of_get_flat_dt_prop():
  - The return type was made const,
  - The last parameter was changed from "unsigned long *" to "int *".
and dt_mem_next_cell():
  - The second parameter was made const.

This causes the following compiler warnings:

Update the variable types in rcar_gen2_scan_mem() to fix this.
