module: Clean up ro/nx after early module load failures

The commit

    4982223e51e8 module: set nx before marking module MODULE_STATE_COMING.

introduced a regression: if a module fails to parse its arguments or
if mod_sysfs_setup fails, then the module's memory will be freed
while still read-only.  Anything that reuses that memory will crash
as soon as it tries to write to it.
