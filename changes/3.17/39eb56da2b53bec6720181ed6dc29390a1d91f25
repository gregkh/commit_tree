pcmcia: Remove m8xx_pcmcia driver

This driver doesn't build, and apparently has not built since
arch/ppc was removed in 2008 (when mk_int_int_mask was removed
from asm/irq.h, among other build errors).

A few weeks ago I asked whether anyone was actively maintaining
this code, and got no positive response:
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/352082/

So, let's remove it.
