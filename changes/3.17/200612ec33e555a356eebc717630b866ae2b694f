dm table: propagate QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE

Commit 05f1dd5 ("block: add queue flag for disabling SG merging")
introduced a new queue flag: QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE.  This gets set by
default in blk_mq_init_queue for mq-enabled devices.  The effect of
the flag is to bypass the SG segment merging.  Instead, the
bio->bi_vcnt is used as the number of hardware segments.

With a device mapper target on top of a device with
QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE set, we can end up sending down more segments
than a driver is prepared to handle.  I ran into this when backporting
the virtio_blk mq support.  It triggerred this BUG_ON, in
virtio_queue_rq:

        BUG_ON(req->nr_phys_segments + 2 > vblk->sg_elems);

The queue's max is set here:
        blk_queue_max_segments(q, vblk->sg_elems-2);

Basically, what happens is that a bio is built up for the dm device
(which does not have the QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE flag set) using
bio_add_page.  That path will call into __blk_recalc_rq_segments, so
what you end up with is bi_phys_segments being much smaller than bi_vcnt
(and bi_vcnt grows beyond the maximum sg elements).  Then, when the bio
is submitted, it gets cloned.  When the cloned bio is submitted, it will
end up in blk_recount_segments, here:

        if (test_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE, &q->queue_flags))
                bio->bi_phys_segments = bio->bi_vcnt;

and now we've set bio->bi_phys_segments to a number that is beyond what
was registered as queue_max_segments by the driver.

The right way to fix this is to propagate the queue flag up the stack.

The rules for propagating the flag are simple:
- if the flag is set for any underlying device, it must be set for the
  upper device
- consequently, if the flag is not set for any underlying device, it
  should not be set for the upper device.
