tcp: switch snt_synack back to measuring transmit time of first SYNACK

Always store in snt_synack the time at which the server received the
first client SYN and attempted to send the first SYNACK.

Recent commit aa27fc501 ("tcp: tcp_v[46]_conn_request: fix snt_synack
initialization") resolved an inconsistency between IPv4 and IPv6 in
the initialization of snt_synack. This commit brings back the idea
from 843f4a55e (tcp: use tcp_v4_send_synack on first SYN-ACK), which
was going for the original behavior of snt_synack from the commit
where it was added in 9ad7c049f0f79 ("tcp: RFC2988bis + taking RTT
sample from 3WHS for the passive open side") in v3.1.

In addition to being simpler (and probably a tiny bit faster),
unconditionally storing the time of the first SYNACK attempt has been
useful because it allows calculating a performance metric quantifying
how long it took to establish a passive TCP connection.
