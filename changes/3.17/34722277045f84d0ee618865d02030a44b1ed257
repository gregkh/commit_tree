Bluetooth: Fix check for re-enabling advertising

There are many different places that can disable LE scanning but we only
want to re-enable advertising in hci_cc_le_set_scan_enable() for a very
specific use case, which is when the active scanning part of Start
Discovery is complete. Because of this, fix the discovery state check to
test for the exact state.
