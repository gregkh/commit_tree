Revert "ACPI / battery: Fix warning message in acpi_battery_get_state()"

This reverts commit d719870b41e0 ("ACPI / battery: Fix warning message in
acpi_battery_get_state()")

Capping 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity' is plain wrong. If this
is necessary to work around some buggy firmware, then the workaround needs
protection against being applied to working firmwares.

Good battery firmwares will allow 'capacity_now' to increase above
'full_charge_capacity', and will update the latter when the battery
is fully charged.  By capping 'capacity_now' we lose accurate capacity
reporting until charging is complete whenever 'full_charge_capacity'
needs to be increased.
