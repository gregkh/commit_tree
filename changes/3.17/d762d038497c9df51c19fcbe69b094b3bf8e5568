net: ppp: reset nextseq counter when enabling SC_MULTILINK

If using a demand-dialled PPP unit for a PPP multilink master, the pppd
daemon needs to reset the sequence counter between two connections. This
allows the daemon to reuse the PPP unit instead of destroying and recreating
it. As there is no API to reset the counter, this patch resets the counter
whenever the SC_MULTILINK flag is set.
