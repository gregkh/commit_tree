timekeeping: Another fix to the VSYSCALL_OLD update_vsyscall

Benjamin Herrenschmidt pointed out that I further missed modifying
update_vsyscall after the wall_to_mono value was changed to a
timespec64.  This causes issues on powerpc32, which expects a 32bit
timespec.

This patch fixes the problem by properly converting from a timespec64 to
a timespec before passing the value on to the arch-specific vsyscall
logic.

[ Thomas is currently on vacation, but reviewed it and wanted me to send
  this fix on to you directly. ]
