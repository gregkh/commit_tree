staging: comedi: das1800: tidy up das1800_probe()

The (*attach) of driver calls this function to probe the 'id' of the
hardware to verify that a valid boardinfo has been selected by the
user.

The dev_dbg() messages when the boardinfo is valid is just added
noise. The printk messages when the id does not match the boardinfo
does have some value.

Refactor the function to remove the noise and use a common message
for the "(probed, not recommended)" message.

Convert the printk() messages to dev_err().
