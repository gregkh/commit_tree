xfrm: Generate queueing routes only from route lookup functions

Currently we genarate a queueing route if we have matching policies
but can not resolve the states and the sysctl xfrm_larval_drop is
disabled. Here we assume that dst_output() is called to kill the
queued packets. Unfortunately this assumption is not true in all
cases, so it is possible that these packets leave the system unwanted.

We fix this by generating queueing routes only from the
route lookup functions, here we can guarantee a call to
dst_output() afterwards.
