metag: hugetlbpage: Remove null pointer checks that could never happen

There are inconsistent NULL checks in
hugetlb_get_unmapped_area_existing(). The last conditional block in the
loop checks vma, but vma is dereferenced after that.

Due to the checks above however (bearing in mind after_huge is either 0
or 1) vma is guaranteed not to be NULL here, so remove that part of the
check.
