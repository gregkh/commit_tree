ACPICA: Common: Enhance cm_get_file_size() to improve portability

This patch uses abstract file IO and acpi_log_error() APIs to enhance
cm_get_file_size() so that applications that invoke this API could have
portability improved.

With actual references added to abstract file IO and acpi_log_error(), the
applications need to link oslibcfs.o, utdebug.o, utexcep.o, utmath.o,
utprint.o and utxferror.o.

It is also required to add acpi_os_initialize() invocations if an
application starts to use acpi_log_error().

acpidump has already invoked acpi_os_initialize() in this way.  Lv Zheng.
