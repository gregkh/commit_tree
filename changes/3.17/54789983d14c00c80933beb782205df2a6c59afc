net: ks8851-ml: Use devm_ioremap_resource

This patch introduces the use of devm_ioremap_resource, devm_kmalloc and
does away with the functions to free the allocated memory in the probe
and remove functions. Also, some labels are done away with. A bug is
fixed as two regions are allocated in the probe function, but only one
is freed in the remove function.
