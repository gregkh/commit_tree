hwspinlock: enable OMAP build for AM33xx, AM43xx & DRA7xx

HwSpinlocks are supported on TI's AM33xx, AM43xx and DRA7xx SoC
device families as well. The IPs are identical to that of
OMAP4/OMAP5, except for the number of locks.

Add a depends on to the above family of SoCs to enable the
build support for OMAP hwspinlock driver for any of the above
SoC configs.
