ASoC: samsung: Correct I2S DAI suspend/resume ops

We should save/restore relevant I2S registers regardless of
the dai->active flag, otherwise some settings are being lost
after system suspend/resume cycle. E.g. I2S slave mode set only
during dai initialization is not preserved and the device ends
up in master mode after system resume.
