drm/nouveau/nvif: import library functions for the ioctl/event interfaces

This is a wrapper around the interfaces defined in an earlier commit,
and is also used by various userspace (either by a libdrm backend, or
libpciaccess) tools/tests.

In the future this will be extended to handle channels, replacing some
long-unloved code we currently use, and allow fifo/display/mpeg (hi
Ilia ;)) engines to all be exposed in the same way.
