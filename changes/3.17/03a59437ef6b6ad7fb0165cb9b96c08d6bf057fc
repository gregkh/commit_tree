mmc: Allow forward compatibility for eMMC

As stated by the eMMC 5.0 specification, a chip should not be rejected
only because of the revision stated in the EXT_CSD_REV field of the
EXT_CSD register.

Remove the control on this value, the control of the CSD_STRUCTURE field
should be sufficient to reject future incompatible changes.
