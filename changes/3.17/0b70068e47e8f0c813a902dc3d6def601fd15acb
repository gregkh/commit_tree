mm: export symbol dependencies of is_zero_pfn()

In order to make the static inline function is_zero_pfn() callable by
modules, export its symbol dependencies 'zero_pfn' and (for s390 and
mips) 'zero_page_mask'.

We need this for KVM, as CONFIG_KVM is a tristate for all supported
architectures except ARM and arm64, and testing a pfn whether it refers
to the zero page is required to correctly distinguish the zero page
from other special RAM ranges that may also have the PG_reserved bit
set, but need to be treated as MMIO memory.
