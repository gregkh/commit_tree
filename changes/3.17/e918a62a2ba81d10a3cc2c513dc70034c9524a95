ARM: 8135/1: Fix in-correct barrier usage in SWP{B} emulation

According to the ARM ARMv7, explicit barriers are necessary when using
synchronisation primitives such as SWP{B}. The use of these
instructions does not automatically imply a barrier and any ordering
requirements by the software must be explicitly expressed with the use
of suitable barriers.

Based on this, remove the barriers from SWP{B} emulation.
