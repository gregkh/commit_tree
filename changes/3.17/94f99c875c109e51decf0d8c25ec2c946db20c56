ASoC: Move name_prefix from CODEC to component

Move the name_prefix from the CODEC struct to the component struct. This will
eventually allow to specify prefixes for all types of components. It is also
necessary to make the DAPM code component type independent (i.e. a DAPM context
does not need to know whether it belongs to a CODEC or a platform or something
else).
