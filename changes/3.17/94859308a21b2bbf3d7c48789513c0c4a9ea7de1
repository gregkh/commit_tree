w1: new w1_ds2406 driver

Some preliminary work at making use of this driver led me to implement
CRC-16 checks on read and write to deal with the occasional glitchiness of
the 1-Wire bus.  The revised driver (attached) returns an I/O error if the
CRC check fails.  When reading the chip's state, either you get a valid
indication or you get an I/O error.  When changing its state, either the
change is successful or an I/O error is returned.
