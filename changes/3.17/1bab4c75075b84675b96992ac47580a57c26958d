inet: frag: set limits and make init_net's high_thresh limit global

This patch makes init_net's high_thresh limit to be the maximum for all
namespaces, thus introducing a global memory limit threshold equal to the
sum of the individual high_thresh limits which are capped.
It also introduces some sane minimums for low_thresh as it shouldn't be
able to drop below 0 (or > high_thresh in the unsigned case), and
overall low_thresh should not ever be above high_thresh, so we make the
following relations for a namespace:
init_net:
 high_thresh - max(not capped), min(init_net low_thresh)
 low_thresh - max(init_net high_thresh), min (0)

all other namespaces:
 high_thresh = max(init_net high_thresh), min(namespace's low_thresh)
 low_thresh = max(namespace's high_thresh), min(0)

The major issue with having low_thresh > high_thresh is that we'll
schedule eviction but never evict anything and thus rely only on the
timers.
