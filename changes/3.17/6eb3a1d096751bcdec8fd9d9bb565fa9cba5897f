nfsd: set stateid access and deny bits in nfs4_get_vfs_file

Cleanup -- ensure that the stateid bits are set at the same time that
the file access refcounts are incremented. Keeping them coherent like
this makes it easier to ensure that we account for all of the
references.

Since the initialization of the st_*_bmap fields is done when it's
hashed, we go ahead and hash the stateid before getting access to the
file and unhash it if that function returns error. This will be
necessary anyway in a follow-on patch that will overhaul deny mode
handling.
