of: Move dynamic node fixups out of powerpc and into common code

PowerPC does an odd thing with dynamic nodes. It uses a notifier to
catch new node additions and set some of the values like name and type.
This makes no sense since that same code can be put directly into
of_attach_node(). Besides, all dynamic node users need this, not just
powerpc. Fix this problem by moving the logic out of arch/powerpc and
into drivers/of/dynamic.c.

It is also important to remove this notifier because we want to move the
firing of notifiers from before the tree is modified to after so that
the receiver gets a consistent view of the tree, but that is
incompatible with notifiers that modify the node.
