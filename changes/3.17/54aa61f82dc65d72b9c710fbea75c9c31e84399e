xfs: tidy up xfs_set_inode32

xfs_set_inode32() caught my eye because it had weird spacing around
the "-1's".  In cleaning that up, I realized that the assignment in
the declaration of "ino" is never used; it's rewritten before it
gets read.

Drop the ino initializer from its declaration since it's not used,
and move the agino initialization into the body of the function,
mostly so that we can have pretty whitespace and not exceed 80
columns.  :)
