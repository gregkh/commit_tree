Revert "drm/i915: Enable PSR by default."

This reverts commit b6d547791fd3ef4ccc89ad2556ab01045640aef7.

The panel self refresh clearly isn't stable yet, and causes my laptop
(Haswell ULT in a Sony Vaio Pro) to have the screen lock up.  Maybe it
doesn't ever get out of self-refresh, or maybe there are gremlins in the
machine that get unhappy.  Regardless, it's broken, and it gets
reverted.
