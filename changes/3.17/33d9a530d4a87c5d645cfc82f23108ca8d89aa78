MIPS: OCTEON: make get_system_type() thread-safe

get_system_type() is not thread-safe on OCTEON. It uses static data,
also more dangerous issue is that it's calling cvmx_fuse_read_byte()
every time without any synchronization. Currently it's possible to get
processes stuck looping forever in kernel simply by launching multiple
readers of /proc/cpuinfo:

	(while true; do cat /proc/cpuinfo > /dev/null; done) &
	(while true; do cat /proc/cpuinfo > /dev/null; done) &
	...

Fix by initializing the system type string only once during the early
boot.
