ALSA: hda/realtek - Avoid setting wrong COEF on ALC269 & co

ALC269 & co have many vendor-specific setups with COEF verbs.
However, some verbs seem specific to some codec versions and they
result in the codec stalling.  Typically, such a case can be avoided
by checking the return value from reading a COEF.  If the return value
is -1, it implies that the COEF is invalid, thus it shouldn't be
written.

This patch adds the invalid COEF checks in appropriate places
accessing ALC269 and its variants.  The patch actually fixes the
resume problem on Acer AO725 laptop.
