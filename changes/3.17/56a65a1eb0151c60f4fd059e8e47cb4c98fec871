[media] staging: lirc: Introduce the use of managed interfaces

This patch introduces the use of managed interfaces like
devm_request_mem_region and devm_request_irq and does away with the
calls to free the allocated memory in the probe and remove functions.
The remove function is no longer required and is removed completely.
