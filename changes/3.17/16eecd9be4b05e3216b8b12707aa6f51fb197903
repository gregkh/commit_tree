dcbnl : Fix misleading dcb_app->priority explanation

Current explanation of dcb_app->priority is wrong. It says priority is
expected to be a 3-bit unsigned integer which is only true when working with
DCBx-IEEE. Use of dcb_app->priority by DCBx-CEE expects it to be 802.1p user
priority bitmap. Updated accordingly

This affects the cxgb4 driver, but I will post those changes as part of a
larger changeset shortly.
