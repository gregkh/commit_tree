net: ppp: access ppp->nextseq only if CONFIG_PPP_MULTILINK is defined

Commit d762d038497c9df51c19fcbe69b094b3bf8e5568 resets the counter holding the
next sequence number for multilink PPP fragments to zero whenever the
SC_MULTILINK flag is set. However, this counter only exists if
CONFIG_PPP_MULTILINK is defined. Consequently, the new code has to be enclosed
within #ifdef CONFIG_PPP_MULTILINK ... #endif.
