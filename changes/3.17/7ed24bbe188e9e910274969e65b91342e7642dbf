net: stmmac: Change MAC interface to support multiple filter configurations

The synopsys EMAC can be configured for different numbers of multicast hash
bins and perfect filter entries at device creation time and there's no way
to query this configuration information at runtime. As a result, a devicetree
parameter is required in order for the driver to program these filters
correctly for a particular device instance. This patch modifies the
10/100/1000 MAC software interface such that these configuration parameters
can be set at initialization time.
