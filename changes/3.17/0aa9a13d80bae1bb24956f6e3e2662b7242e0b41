mm, slub: fix some indenting in cmpxchg_double_slab()

The return statement goes with the cmpxchg_double() condition so it needs
to be indented another tab.

Also these days the fashion is to line function parameters up, and it
looks nicer that way because then the "freelist_new" is not at the same
indent level as the "return 1;".
