ARM: KVM: one_reg coproc set and get BE fixes

Fix code that handles KVM_SET_ONE_REG, KVM_GET_ONE_REG ioctls to work in BE
image. Before this fix get/set_one_reg functions worked correctly only in
LE case - reg_from_user was taking 'void *' kernel address that actually could
be target/source memory of either 4 bytes size or 8 bytes size, and code copied
from/to user memory that could hold either 4 bytes register, 8 byte register
or pair of 4 bytes registers.

In order to work in endian agnostic way reg_from_user to reg_to_user functions
should copy register value only to kernel variable with size that matches
register size. In few place where size mismatch existed fix issue on macro
caller side.
