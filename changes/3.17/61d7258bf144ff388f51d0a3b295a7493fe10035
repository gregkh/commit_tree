staging/lustre/ptlrpc: Protect request buffer changing

*_enlarge_reqbuf class of functions can change request body location
for a request that's already in replay list, as such a parallel
traverser of the list (after_reply -> ptlrpc_free_committed) might
access freed and scrambled memory causing assertion.

Since all such users only can get to this request under imp_lock, take
imp_lock to protect against them in *_enlarge_reqbuf
