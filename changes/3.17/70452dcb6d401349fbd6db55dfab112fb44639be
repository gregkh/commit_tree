tipc: fix a memleak when sending data

This fixes a regression bug caused by:
067608e9d019d6477fd45dd948e81af0e5bf599f ("tipc: introduce direct
iovec to buffer chain fragmentation function")

If data is sent on a nonblocking socket and the destination link
is congested, the buffer chain is leaked. We fix this by freeing
the chain in this case.
