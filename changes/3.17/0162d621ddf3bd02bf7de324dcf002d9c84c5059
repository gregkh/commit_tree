ftrace: Rename ftrace_ops field from trampolines to nr_trampolines

Having two fields within the same struct that is off by one character
can be confusing and error prone. Rename the counter "trampolines"
to "nr_trampolines" to explicitly show it is a counter and not to
be confused by the "trampoline" field.
