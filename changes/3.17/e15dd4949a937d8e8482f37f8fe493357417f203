efi/arm64: Preserve FP/SIMD registers on UEFI runtime services calls

According to the UEFI spec section 2.3.6.4, the use of FP/SIMD
instructions is allowed, and should adhere to the AAPCS64 calling
convention, which states that 'only the bottom 64 bits of each value
stored in registers v8-v15 need to be preserved' (section 5.1.2).

This applies equally to UEFI Runtime Services called by the kernel, so
make sure the FP/SIMD register file is preserved in this case. We do this
by enabling the wrappers for UEFI Runtime Services (CONFIG_EFI_RUNTIME_WRAPPERS)
and inserting calls to kernel_neon_begin()and kernel_neon_end() into
these wrappers.
