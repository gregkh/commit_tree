ASoC: Intel: byt-max98090: Do not enable MAX98090 microphone detection

It turned out there is no need to enable microphone detection in MAX98090
codec. Headset microphone is anyway detected by a GPIO signal from another
chip and headset button presses cannot be detected either because a signal
needed for it is not connected.
