drm/i915: Don't accumulate hangcheck score on forward progress

If the actual head has progressed forward inside a batch (request),
don't accumulate hangcheck score.

As the hangcheck score in increased only by acthd jumping backwards,
the result is that we only declare an active batch as stuck if it is
trapped inside a loop. Or that the looping will dominate the batch
progression so that it overcomes the bonus that forward progress gives.
