ACPI / hotplug: Simplify acpi_set_hp_context()

Since all of the acpi_set_hp_context() callers pass at least one NULL
function pointer and one caller passes NULL function pointers only
to it, drop function pointer arguments from acpi_set_hp_context()
and make the callers initialize the function pointers in struct
acpi_hotplug_context by themselves before passing it to
acpi_set_hp_context().
