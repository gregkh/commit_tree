can: flexcan: put TX mailbox into TX_INACTIVE mode after tx-complete

After sending a RTR frame the TX mailbox becomes a RX_EMPTY mailbox. To avoid
side effects when the RX-FIFO is full, this patch puts the TX mailbox into
TX_INACTIVE mode in the transmission complete interrupt handler. This, of
course, leaves a race window between the actual completion of the transmission
and the handling of tx-complete interrupt. However this is the best we can do
without busy polling the tx complete interrupt.
