drm/i915: extract and improve gen8_irq_power_well_post_enable

Move it from hsw_power_well_post_enable() (intel_pm.c) to i915_irq.c
so we can reuse the nice IRQ macros we have there. The main difference
is that now we're going to check if the IIR register is non-zero when
we try to re-enable the interrupts.
