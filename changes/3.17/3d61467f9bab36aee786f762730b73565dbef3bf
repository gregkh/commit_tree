irqchip: atmel-aic: Implement RTC irq fixup

Provide an implementation to fix RTC irqs before enabling the irqchip.

This was previously done in arch/arm/mach-at91/sysirq_mask.c but as we're
trying to use standard implementation (IRQCHIP_DECLARE and automatic call
of irqchip_init within arch/arm/kernel/irq.c) we need to do those fixups
in the irqchip driver.
