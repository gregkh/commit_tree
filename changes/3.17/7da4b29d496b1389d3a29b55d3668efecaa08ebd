crypto: aesni - disable "by8" AVX CTR optimization

The "by8" implementation introduced in commit 22cddcc7df8f ("crypto: aes
- AES CTR x86_64 "by8" AVX optimization") is failing crypto tests as it
handles counter block overflows differently. It only accounts the right
most 32 bit as a counter -- not the whole block as all other
implementations do. This makes it fail the cryptomgr test #4 that
specifically tests this corner case.

As we're quite late in the release cycle, just disable the "by8" variant
for now.
