Revert "mac80211: disable uAPSD if all ACs are under ACM"

This reverts commit 24aa11ab8ae03292d38ec0dbd9bc2ac49fe8a6dd.

That commit was wrong since it uses data that hasn't even been set
up yet, but might be a hold-over from a previous connection.

Additionally, it seems like a driver-specific workaround that
shouldn't have been in mac80211 to start with.
