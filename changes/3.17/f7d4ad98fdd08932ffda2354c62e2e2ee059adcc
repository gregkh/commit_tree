gpiolib: Export gpiochip_request_own_desc and gpiochip_free_own_desc

Both functions were introduced to let gpio drivers request their own
gpio pins. Without exporting the functions, this can however only be
used by gpio drivers built into the kernel.

Secondary impact is that the functions can not currently be used by
platform initialization code associated with the gpio-pca953x driver.
This code permits auto-export of gpio pins through platform data, but
if this functionality is used, the module can no longer be unloaded due
to the problem solved with the introduction of gpiochip_request_own_desc
and gpiochip_free_own_desc.

Export both function so they can be used from modules and from
platform initialization code.
