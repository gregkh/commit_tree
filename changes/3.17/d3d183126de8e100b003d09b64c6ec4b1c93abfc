be2net: ignore get/set profile FW cmd failures

Old versions of BE3 FW may not support cmds to re-provision (and hence
optimize) resources/queues in SR-IOV config. Do not treat this FW cmd
failure as fatal and fail the function initialization. Instead, just
enable SR-IOV with the resources provided by the FW.

Prior to the "create optimal number of queues on SR-IOV config" patch
such failures were ignored.
Fixes: bec84e6b2 ("create optimal number of queues on SR-IOV config")
