ARM: shmobile: Sync Marzen DTS with Marzen reference DTS

Copy the device nodes from Marzen reference into the Marzen device tree
file. This will allow us to use a single DTS file regardless of kernel
configuration. In case of legacy C board code the device nodes may or
may not be used, but in the multiplatform case all the DT device nodes
will be used.

Based on a similar change for the Lager board by Laurent Pinchart.
