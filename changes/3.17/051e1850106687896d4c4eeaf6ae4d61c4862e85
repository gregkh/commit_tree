workqueue: unfold start_worker() into create_worker()

Simply unfold the code of start_worker() into create_worker() and
remove the original start_worker() and create_and_start_worker().

The only trade-off is the introduced overhead that the pool->lock
is released and regrabbed after the newly worker is started.
The overhead is acceptible since the manager is slow path.

And because this new locking behavior, the newly created worker
may grab the lock earlier than the manager and go to process
work items. In this case, the recheck need_to_create_worker() may be
true as expected and the manager goes to restart which is the
correct behavior.
