MIPS: perf: Add hardware events for P5600

Add cases in perf_event_mipsxx.c for CPU_P5600. All the event numbers
listed for proAptiv also apply to P5600, so we use mipsxxcore_event_map2
and mipsxxcore_cache_map2 too, but the P5600 has 8-bit event numbers so
bit 8 (256) of the user ABI config is used for the parity bit (to
specify odd/even counter events).
