staging: comedi: ni_stc.h: the boardinfo 'name' should be first

By convention, the first member of the boardinfo is a 'const char *' to
the board name, especially for those comedi drivers that rely on the
comedi core to set dev->board_ptr to the entry matching the board name
when doing a legacy (*attach) to a comedi driver.

Modify the ni_board_struct appropriately for consistency, although the
board name is only used for informational purposes by this driver (only
the driver name is matched by the comedi core).

For aesthetics, also move the members in the boardinfo declarations.
