tracing: Clean up trace_seq.c

For using trace_seq_*() functions in NMI context, I posted a patch to move
it to the lib/ directory. This caused Andrew Morton to take a look at the code.
He went through and gave a lot of comments about missing kernel doc,
inconsistent types for the save variable, mix match of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()
and EXPORT_SYMBOL() as well as missing EXPORT_SYMBOL*()s. There were
a few comments about the way variables were being compared (int vs uint).

All these were good review comments and should be implemented regardless of
if trace_seq.c should be moved to lib/ or not.
