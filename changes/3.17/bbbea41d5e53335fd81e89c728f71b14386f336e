net: sctp: deprecate rfc6458, 5.3.2. SCTP_SNDRCV support

With support of SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO as described in RFC6458,
5.3.4/5.3.5, we can now deprecate SCTP_SNDRCV. The RFC already
declares it as deprecated:

  This structure mixes the send and receive path. SCTP_SNDINFO
  (described in Section 5.3.4) and SCTP_RCVINFO (described in
  Section 5.3.5) split this information. These structures should
  be used, when possible, since SCTP_SNDRCV is deprecated.

So whenever a user tries to subscribe to sctp_data_io_event via
setsockopt(2) which triggers inclusion of SCTP_SNDRCV cmsg_type,
issue a warning in the log.
