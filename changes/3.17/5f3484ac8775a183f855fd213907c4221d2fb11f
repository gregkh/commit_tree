ASoC: core: Move non-shared code paths out of snd_soc_post_component_init()

There are two call sites for snd_soc_post_component_init(), one passes 0 and the
other 1 for the 'dailess' parameter of snd_soc_post_component_init(). Depending
on whether 'dailess' is 0 or 1 snd_soc_post_component_init() runs different code
at the beginning and the end of the function. The patch moves this conditional
code out of snd_soc_post_component_init() and into the call sites. This removes
the need for snd_soc_post_component_init() to know whether it is called for a
DAI link or a aux dev.

Also do the initialization of rtd->card when the rtd struct is allocated.
