drm/dp-mst-helper: Don't use uninitialized fields of the sideband message header

We could be using uninitialized fields of the header in
drm_dp_encode_sideband_msg_hdr(), for instance hdr->somt is set to 1 in
the first patcket but never set to 0 otherwise.

Always clear the header at the start then.
