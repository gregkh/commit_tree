dmaengine: of: add common xlate function for matching by channel id

This patch adds a new common OF dma xlate callback function which will match a
channel by it's id. The binding expects one integer argument which it will use to
lookup the channel by the id.

Unlike of_dma_simple_xlate this function is able to handle a system with
multiple DMA controllers. When registering the of dma provider with
of_dma_controller_register a pointer to the dma_device struct which is
associated with the dt node needs to passed as the data parameter.
New function will use this pointer to match only channels which belong to the
specified DMA controller.
