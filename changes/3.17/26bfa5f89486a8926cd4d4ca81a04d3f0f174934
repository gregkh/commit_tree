x86, amd: Cleanup init_amd

Distribute family-specific code to corresponding functions.

Also,

* move the direct mapping splitting around the TSEG SMM area to
bsp_init_amd().

* kill ancient comment about what we should do for K5.

* merge amd_k7_smp_check() into its only caller init_amd_k7 and drop
cpu_has_mp macro.
