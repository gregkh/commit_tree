btrfs: adjust statfs calculations according to raid profiles

This has been discussed in thread:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/32528

and this patch implements this proposal:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/32536

Works fine for "clean" raid profiles where the raid factor correction
does the right job. Otherwise it's pessimistic and may show low space
although there's still some left.

The df nubmers are lightly wrong in case of mixed block groups, but this
is not a major usecase and can be addressed later.

The RAID56 numbers are wrong almost the same way as before and will be
addressed separately.
