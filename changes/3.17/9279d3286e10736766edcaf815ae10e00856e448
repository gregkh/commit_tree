lib: bitmap: change parameter of bitmap_*_region to unsigned

Changing the pos parameter of __reg_op to unsigned allows the compiler
to generate slightly smaller and simpler code.  Also update its callers
bitmap_*_region to receive and pass unsigned int.  The return types of
bitmap_find_free_region and bitmap_allocate_region are still int to
allow a negative error code to be returned.  An int is certainly capable
of representing any realistic return value.
