KVM: Move more code under CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD

Commits e4d57e1ee1ab (KVM: Move irq notifier implementation into
eventfd.c, 2014-06-30) included the irq notifier code unconditionally
in eventfd.c, while it was under CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQCHIP before.

Similarly, commit 297e21053a52 (KVM: Give IRQFD its own separate enabling
Kconfig option, 2014-06-30) moved code from CONFIG_HAVE_IRQ_ROUTING
to CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD but forgot to move the pieces that used to be
under CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQCHIP.

Together, this broke compilation without CONFIG_KVM_XICS.  Fix by adding
or changing the #ifdefs so that they point at CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD.
