random: clean up interrupt entropy accounting for archs w/o cycle counters

For architectures that don't have cycle counters, the algorithm for
deciding when to avoid giving entropy credit due to back-to-back timer
interrupts didn't make any sense, since we were checking every 64
interrupts.  Change it so that we only give an entropy credit if the
majority of the interrupts are not based on the timer.
