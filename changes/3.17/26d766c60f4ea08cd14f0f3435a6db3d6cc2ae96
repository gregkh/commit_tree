s390/3215: fix hanging console issue

The ccw_device_start in raw3215_start_io can fail. raw3215_try_io
does not check if the request could be started and removes any
pending timer. This can leave the system in a hanging state.
Check for pending request after raw3215_start_io and start a
timer if necessary.
