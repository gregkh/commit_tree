drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1742.c: revert "drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1742.c: remove redundant of_match_ptr() helper"

Commit 5516f0971793 ("drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1742.c: remove redundant
of_match_ptr() helper") has description as: "'ds1742_rtc_of_match' is
always compiled in.  Hence the helper macro is not needed".

It is not true, of_match_ptr() macro makes of_device_id parameter unused
and this constant is declared with __maybe_unused attribute, so normally
this variable should be discarded by linker.  This patch revers this
commit, since there are no reason to compile of_device_id constant for
non-DT systems.
