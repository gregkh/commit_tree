radeon: Test for PCI root bus before assuming bus->self

If we assign a Radeon device to a virtual machine, we can no longer
assume a fixed hardware topology, like the GPU having a parent device.
This patch simply adds a few pci_is_root_bus() tests to avoid passing
a NULL pointer to PCI access functions, allowing the radeon driver to
work in a QEMU 440FX machine with an assigned HD8570 on the emulated
PCI root bus.
