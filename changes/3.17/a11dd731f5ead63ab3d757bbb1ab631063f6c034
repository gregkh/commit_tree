ARM: SWP emulation: always enable when SMP is enabled

SWP is deprecated in ARMv6 and ARMv7 CPUs, but more importantly, when
running on a SMP system, SWP doesn't guarantee atomicity.  This means
it can't really be used (by userspace) for locking purposes in a SMP
environment.

Currently, many configurations leave the SWP emulation disabled, which
means we never know if userspace executes this instruction on ARMv7
hardware.  Rectify this by enabling SWP emulation for ARMv7 with SMP
(where we can trap the instruction.)
