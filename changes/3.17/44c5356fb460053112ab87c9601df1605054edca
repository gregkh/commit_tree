slab common: add functions for kmem_cache_node access

The patchset provides two new functions in mm/slab.h and modifies SLAB
and SLUB to use these.  The kmem_cache_node structure is shared between
both allocators and the use of common accessors will allow us to move
more code into slab_common.c in the future.

This patch (of 3):

These functions allow to eliminate repeatedly used code in both SLAB and
SLUB and also allow for the insertion of debugging code that may be
needed in the development process.
