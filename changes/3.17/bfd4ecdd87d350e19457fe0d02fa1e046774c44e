net: fec: consolidate hwtstamp implementation

Both transmit and receive use the same infrastructure for calculating
the packet timestamp.  Rather than duplicating the code, provide a
function to do this common work.  Model this function in the Intel
e1000e version which avoids calling ns_to_ktime() within the spinlock;
the spinlock is critical for timecounter_cyc2time() but not
ns_to_ktime().
