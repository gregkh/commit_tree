ALSA: hda - Fix build error in hda_tegra.c

The "list" field has been omitted from struct azx, but its
initialization remained mistakenly in hda_tegra.c, which leads to a
compile error:
   sound/pci/hda/hda_tegra.c: In function 'hda_tegra_create':
   sound/pci/hda/hda_tegra.c:481:22: error: 'struct azx' has no member
named 'list'
