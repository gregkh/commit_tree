bus: omap_l3_noc: Fix connID for OMAP4

Commit d4d8819e205854c ("bus: omap_l3_noc: fix masterid detection")
did the right thing in dropping the LSB 2 bits which is not part
of the ConnID for NTTP master address. However, as part of that
change, we should also have ensured that existing list of OMAP4 connID
codes are also shifted by 2 bits to ensure that connIDs map to "Table
13-18. ConnID Values" as provided in Technical Reference Manuals for
OMAP4430(Rev AP, April 2014, SWPU220AP) and OMAP4460(Rev AB, April
2014, SWPU234AB)
