staging: comedi: s626: remove 'set_load_trig' callback from encoder private data

There are two functions used for the 'set_load_trig' callback, One is used for
the channel 0-2 encoders and the other for the channel 3-5 encoders.

Refactor the two callbacks into a single s626_set_load_trig() function and use
the encoder channel number to handle the differences.

Remove the then unnecessary 'set_load_trig' member and just call s626_set_load_trig()
drectly.
