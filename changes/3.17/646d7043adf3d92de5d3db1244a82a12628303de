ftrace: Allow archs to specify if they need a separate function graph trampoline

Currently if an arch supports function graph tracing, the core code will
just assign the function graph trampoline to the function graph addr that
gets called.

But as the old method for function graph tracing always calls the function
trampoline first and that calls the function graph trampoline, some
archs may have the function graph trampoline dependent on operations that
were done in the function trampoline. This causes function graph tracer
to break on those archs.

Instead of having the default be to set the function graph ftrace_ops
to the function graph trampoline, have it instead just set it to zero
which will keep it from jumping to a trampoline that is not set up
to be jumped directly too.
