nfsd: print status when nfsd4_open fails to open file it just created

It's possible for nfsd to fail opening a file that it has just created.
When that happens, we throw a WARN but it doesn't include any info about
the error code. Print the status code to give us a bit more info.

Our QA group hit some of these warnings under some very heavy stress
testing. My suspicion is that they hit the file-max limit, but it's hard
to know for sure. Go ahead and add a -ENFILE mapping to
nfserr_serverfault to make the error more distinct (and correct).
