ALSA: dice: fix wrong channel mappping at higher sampling rate

The channel mapping is initialized by amdtp_stream_set_parameters(), however
Dice driver set it before calling this function. Furthermore, the setting is
wrong because the index is the value of array, and vice versa.

This commit moves codes for channel mapping after the function and set it correctly.
