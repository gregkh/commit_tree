netfilter: log: split family specific code to nf_log_{ip,ip6,common}.c files

The plain text logging is currently embedded into the xt_LOG target.
In order to be able to use the plain text logging from nft_log, as a
first step, this patch moves the family specific code to the following
files and Kconfig symbols:

1) net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_log_ip.c: CONFIG_NF_LOG_IPV4
2) net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_log_ip6.c: CONFIG_NF_LOG_IPV6
3) net/netfilter/nf_log_common.c: CONFIG_NF_LOG_COMMON

These new modules will be required by xt_LOG and nft_log. This patch
is based on original patch from Arturo Borrero Gonzalez.
