mm: memcontrol: use root_mem_cgroup res_counter

Due to an old optimization to keep expensive res_counter changes at a
minimum, the root_mem_cgroup res_counter is never charged; there is no
limit at that level anyway, and any statistics can be generated on
demand by summing up the counters of all other cgroups.

However, with per-cpu charge caches, res_counter operations do not even
show up in profiles anymore, so this optimization is no longer
necessary.

Remove it to simplify the code.
