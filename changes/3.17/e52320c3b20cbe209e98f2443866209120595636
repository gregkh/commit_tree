Coccinelle: Script to detect incorrect argument to sizeof

This makes an effort to find cases where the argument to sizeof is wrong
in memory allocation functions by checking the type of the allocated
memory when it is a double pointer and ensuring the sizeof argument takes
a pointer to the the memory being allocated. There are false positives
in cases the sizeof argument is not used in constructing the return value.
