net: moxa: replace build_skb() with netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align() / memcpy()

build_skb() is used to make skbs out of existing RX ring memory
which is bad because the RX ring is allocated only once, on probe.
Memory corruption occur because said memory is reclaimed, i.e.
__kfree_skb() (and eventually put_page()).

Replace build_skb() with netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align() and use memcpy().

Remove SKB_DATA_ALIGN() from RX buffer size while we're at it.
