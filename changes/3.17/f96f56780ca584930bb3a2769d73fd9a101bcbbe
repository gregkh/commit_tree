kprobes: Skip kretprobe hit in NMI context to avoid deadlock

Skip kretprobe hit in NMI context, because if an NMI happens
inside the critical section protected by kretprobe_table.lock
and another(or same) kretprobe hit, pre_kretprobe_handler
tries to lock kretprobe_table.lock again.
Normal interrupts have no problem because they are disabled
with the lock.
