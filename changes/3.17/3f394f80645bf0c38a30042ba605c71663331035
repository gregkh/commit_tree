ARM: tegra: export apb dma readl/writel

Export APB DMA readl and writel. These are needed because we can't
access the fuses directly on Tegra20 without potentially causing a
system hang. Also have the APB DMA readl and writel return an error in
case of a read failure instead of just returning zero or ignore write
failures.
