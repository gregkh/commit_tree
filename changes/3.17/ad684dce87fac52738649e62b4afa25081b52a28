ARM: 8179/1: kprobes-test: Fix compile error "bad immediate value for offset"

When compiling kprobes-test-arm.c the following error has been observed

/tmp/ccoT403o.s:21439: Error: bad immediate value for offset (4168)

This is caused by the compiler spilling it's literal pool too far away
from the site which is trying to reference it with a PC relative load.
This arises because the compiler is underestimating the size of the
inline assembler code present, which apparently it approximates as 4
bytes per line or instruction.

We fix this problem by moving the operations which generate more than
4 bytes out of the text section. Specifically, moving the .ascii
directives to the .rodata section.
