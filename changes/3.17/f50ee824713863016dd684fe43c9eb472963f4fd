cpuidle: mvebu: rename the driver from armada-370-xp to mvebu-v7

This driver will be able to manage the cpuidle for more SoCs than just
Armada 370 and XP. It will also support Armada 38x and potentially
other SoC of the Marvell Armada EBU family. To take this into account,
this patch renames the driver and its symbols.

It also changes the driver name from cpuidle-armada-370-xp to
cpuidle-armada-xp, because separate platform drivers will be
registered for the other SoC types. This change must be done
simultaneously in the cpuidle driver and in the PMSU code in order to
remain bisectable.
