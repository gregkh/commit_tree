mem-hotplug: avoid illegal state prefixed with legal state when changing state of memory_block

We use the following command to online a memory_block:

    echo online|online_kernel|online_movable > /sys/devices/system/memory/memoryXXX/state

But, if we do the following:

    echo online_fhsjkghfkd > /sys/devices/system/memory/memoryXXX/state

the block will also be onlined.

This is because the following code in store_mem_state() does not compare
the whole string, but only the prefix of the string.

  store_mem_state()
  {
       ......
   328         if (!strncmp(buf, "online_kernel", min_t(int, count, 13)))

Here, only compare the first 13 letters of the string. If we give "online_kernelXXXXXX",
it will be recognized as online_kernel, which is incorrect.

   329                 online_type = ONLINE_KERNEL;
   330         else if (!strncmp(buf, "online_movable", min_t(int, count, 14)))

We have the same problem here,

   331                 online_type = ONLINE_MOVABLE;
   332         else if (!strncmp(buf, "online", min_t(int, count, 6)))

here,

(Here is more problematic.  If we give online_movalbe, which is a typo
of online_movable, it will be recognized as online without noticing the
author.)

   333                 online_type = ONLINE_KEEP;
   334         else if (!strncmp(buf, "offline", min_t(int, count, 7)))

and here.

   335                 online_type = -1;
   336         else {
   337                 ret = -EINVAL;
   338                 goto err;
   339         }
       ......
  }

This patch fixes this problem by using sysfs_streq() to compare the
whole string.
