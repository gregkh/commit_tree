xen: Introduce 'xen_nopv' to disable PV extensions for HVM guests.

By default when CONFIG_XEN and CONFIG_XEN_PVHVM kernels are
run, they will enable the PV extensions (drivers, interrupts, timers,
etc) - which is the best option for the majority of use cases.

However, in some cases (kexec not fully working, benchmarking)
we want to disable Xen PV extensions. As such introduce the
'xen_nopv' parameter that will do it.

This parameter is intended only for HVM guests as the Xen PV
guests MUST boot with PV extensions. However, even if you use
'xen_nopv' on Xen PV guests it will be ignored.
