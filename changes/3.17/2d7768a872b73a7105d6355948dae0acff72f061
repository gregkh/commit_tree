iio: st_sensors: add devicetree probing support

The I2C devices that make up the STMicroelectronics MEMS sensors
may be sneakily enabled by cleverly giving the device node the same
name as a string match from the platform device ID table. However
the right method is to use the compatible string.

On detection, the ST sensors use the ID string to probe and
instatiate the right sensor driver, so pass the kernel-internal ID
string in the .data field of the OF match table, and set the I2C
client name to this name when a compatible match is used.

This avoids having misc Linux-specific strings floating around in
the device tree.
