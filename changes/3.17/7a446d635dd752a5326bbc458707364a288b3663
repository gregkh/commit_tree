hyperv: remove meaningless pr_err() in vmbus_recvpacket_raw()

All its callers depends on the return value of -ENOBUFS to reallocate a
bigger buffer and retry the receiving. So there's no need to call
pr_err() here since it was not a real issue, otherwise syslog will be
flooded by this false warning.
