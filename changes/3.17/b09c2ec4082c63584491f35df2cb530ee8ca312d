powerpc/powernv: Interface to register/unregister opal dump region

PowerNV platform is capable of capturing host memory region when system
crashes (because of host/firmware). We have new OPAL API to register/
unregister memory region to be captured when system crashes.

This patch adds support for new API. Also during boot time we register
kernel log buffer and unregister before doing kexec.
