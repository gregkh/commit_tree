scsi: Fix qemu boot hang problem

The latest kernel fails to boot qemu arm images when using scsi
for disk access. Boot gets stuck after the following messages.

brd: module loaded
sym53c8xx 0000:00:0c.0: enabling device (0100 -> 0103)
sym0: <895a> rev 0x0 at pci 0000:00:0c.0 irq 93
sym0: No NVRAM, ID 7, Fast-40, LVD, parity checking
sym0: SCSI BUS has been reset.
scsi host0: sym-2.2.3

Bisect points to commit 71e75c97f97a ("scsi: convert device_busy to
atomic_t"). Code inspection shows the following suspicious change
in scsi_request_fn.

out_delay:
-       if (sdev->device_busy == 0 && !scsi_device_blocked(sdev))
+       if (atomic_read(&sdev->device_busy) && !scsi_device_blocked(sdev))
		blk_delay_queue(q, SCSI_QUEUE_DELAY);
	}

'sdev->device_busy == 0' was replaced with 'atomic_read(&sdev->device_busy)',
meaning the logic was reversed. Changing this expression to
'!atomic_read(&sdev->device_busy)' fixes the problem.
