Drivers: scsi: storvsc: Fix a bug in handling VMBUS protocol version

Based on the negotiated VMBUS protocol version, we adjust the size of the storage
protocol messages. The two sizes we currently handle are pre-win8 and post-win8.
In WS2012 R2, we are negotiating higher VMBUS protocol version than the win8
version. Make adjustments to correctly handle this.
