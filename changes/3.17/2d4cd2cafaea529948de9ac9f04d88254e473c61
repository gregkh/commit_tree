ARM: Kirkwood: allow to use netxbig DTSI for d2net_v2 DTS

The d2 Network v2 board (d2net_v2) shares a lot of hardware
characteristics with the 2Big and 5Big Network v2 boards. This patch
prepares the kirkwood-netxbig.dtsi file in order to allow to include it
from the d2net_v2 DTS file. The DT nodes only relevant for the 2Big and
5Big Network v2 boards are moved into their respective DTS files.
