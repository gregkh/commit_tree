ASoC: fsi: use SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV for sound buffer

Current fsi driver is using SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_CONTINUOUS
for snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages_for_all().
But, it came from original dma-sh7760.c,
and no longer needed.
This patch exchange its parameter, and removed
original dma mapping and un-needed
dma_sync_single_xxx() from driver.
