USB: OHCI: add check for stopped frame counter

This patch adds an extra check to ohci-hcd's I/O watchdog routine.  If
the controller stops updating the frame counter, we will assume it is
dead.  But there has to be an exception: Some controllers stop the
frame counter when no ports are connected.  Check to make sure there
is at least one active port before deciding the controller is dead.

(This test may appear racy, but it isn't.  Enabling a newly connected
port takes several milliseconds, during which time the frame counter
must advance.)
