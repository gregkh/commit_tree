ARM: mvebu: make the snoop disabling optional in mvebu_v7_pmsu_idle_prepare()

On some mvebu v7 SoCs (the ones using a Cortex-A9 core and not a PJ4B
core), the snoop disabling feature does not exist as the hardware
coherency is handled in a different way. Therefore, in preparation to
the introduction of the cpuidle support for those SoCs, this commit
modifies the mvebu_v7_psmu_idle_prepare() function to take several
flags, which allow to decide whether snooping should be disabled, and
whether we should use the deep idle mode or not.
