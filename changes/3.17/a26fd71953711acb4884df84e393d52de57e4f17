x86/uv: Update the UV3 TLB shootdown logic

Update of TLB shootdown code for UV3.

Kernel function native_flush_tlb_others() calls
uv_flush_tlb_others() on UV to invalidate tlb page definitions
on remote cpus. The UV systems have a hardware 'broadcast assist
unit' which can be used to broadcast shootdown messages to all
cpu's of selected nodes.

The behavior of the BAU has changed only slightly with UV3:

  - UV3 is recognized with is_uv3_hub().
  - UV2 functions and structures (uv2_xxx) are in most cases
    simply renamed to uv2_3_xxx.
  - Some UV2 error workarounds are not needed for UV3.
    (see uv_bau_message_interrupt and enable_timeouts)
