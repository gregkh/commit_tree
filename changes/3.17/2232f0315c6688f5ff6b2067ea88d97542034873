    drm/i915: clear up wedged transitions

I've accidentally inverted the EIO/wedged handling in the fault
handler: We want to return the EIO as a SIGBUS only if it's not
because of the gpu having died, to prevent userspace from unduly
dying.

In my defence the comment right above is completely misleading, so fix
both.

v2: Drop the WARN_ON, it's not actually a bug to e.g. receive an -EIO
when swap-in fails.

v3: Don't remove too much ... oops.
