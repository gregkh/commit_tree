bcache: fix use-after-free in btree_gc_coalesce()

If we goto out_nocoalesce after we free new_nodes[0], we end up freeing
new_nodes[0] again. This was generating a lockdep warning. The fix is
to set new_nodes[0] to NULL, since the out_nocoalesce path safely
ignores NULL entries in the new_nodes array.

This regression was introduced in 2d7f9531.
