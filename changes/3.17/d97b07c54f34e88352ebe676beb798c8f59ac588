initramfs: support initramfs that is bigger than 2GiB

Now with 64bit bzImage and kexec tools, we support ramdisk that size is
bigger than 2g, as we could put it above 4G.

Found compressed initramfs image could not be decompressed properly.  It
turns out that image length is int during decompress detection, and it
will become < 0 when length is more than 2G.  Furthermore, during
decompressing len as int is used for inbuf count, that has problem too.

Change len to long, that should be ok as on 32 bit platform long is
32bits.

Tested with following compressed initramfs image as root with kexec.
	gzip, bzip2, xz, lzma, lzop, lz4.
run time for populate_rootfs():
