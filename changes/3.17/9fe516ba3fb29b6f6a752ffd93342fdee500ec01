inet: move ipv6only in sock_common

When an UDP application switches from AF_INET to AF_INET6 sockets, we
have a small performance degradation for IPv4 communications because of
extra cache line misses to access ipv6only information.

This can also be noticed for TCP listeners, as ipv6_only_sock() is also
used from __inet_lookup_listener()->compute_score()

This is magnified when SO_REUSEPORT is used.

Move ipv6only into struct sock_common so that it is available at
no extra cost in lookups.
