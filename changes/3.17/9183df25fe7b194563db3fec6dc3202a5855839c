shm: add memfd_create() syscall

memfd_create() is similar to mmap(MAP_ANON), but returns a file-descriptor
that you can pass to mmap().  It can support sealing and avoids any
connection to user-visible mount-points.  Thus, it's not subject to quotas
on mounted file-systems, but can be used like malloc()'ed memory, but with
a file-descriptor to it.

memfd_create() returns the raw shmem file, so calls like ftruncate() can
be used to modify the underlying inode.  Also calls like fstat() will
return proper information and mark the file as regular file.  If you want
sealing, you can specify MFD_ALLOW_SEALING.  Otherwise, sealing is not
supported (like on all other regular files).

Compared to O_TMPFILE, it does not require a tmpfs mount-point and is not
subject to a filesystem size limit.  It is still properly accounted to
memcg limits, though, and to the same overcommit or no-overcommit
accounting as all user memory.
