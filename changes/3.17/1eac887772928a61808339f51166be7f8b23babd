drm: drop i386 verification

Linux doesn't run on i386, anymore. See:

    commit d55c5a93db2d5fa95f233ab153f594365d95b777

        x86, 386 removal: Remove CONFIG_CMPXCHG

        All 486+ CPUs support CMPXCHG, so remove the fallback 386 support
        code.

Furthermore, as the commit-message states, all 486+ CPUs support the
CMPXCHG instruction and thus even legacy DRM can run fine.

Drop the now superfluous "x86 == 3" check.
