ARM: socfpga: Add missing #reset-cells to socfpga device tree

add #reset-cells to socfpga.dtsi. This was missing from the
latest updates and caused the socfpga reset controller to fail
to load like so:

ffd05000.rstmgr: /soc/rstmgr@ffd05000 missing #reset-cells property
probe of ffd05000.rstmgr failed with error -22
