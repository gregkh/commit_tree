netlabel: fix a problem when setting bits below the previously lowest bit

The NetLabel category (catmap) functions have a problem in that they
assume categories will be set in an increasing manner, e.g. the next
category set will always be larger than the last.  Unfortunately, this
is not a valid assumption and could result in problems when attempting
to set categories less than the startbit in the lowest catmap node.
In some cases kernel panics and other nasties can result.

This patch corrects the problem by checking for this and allocating a
new catmap node instance and placing it at the front of the list.
