alarmtimer: Lock k_itimer during timer callback

Locks the k_itimer's it_lock member when handling the alarm timer's
expiry callback.

The regular posix timers defined in posix-timers.c have this lock held
during timout processing because their callbacks are routed through
posix_timer_fn().  The alarm timers follow a different path, so they
ought to grab the lock somewhere else.
