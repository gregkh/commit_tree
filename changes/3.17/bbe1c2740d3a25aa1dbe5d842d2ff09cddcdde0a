drm/i915: Remove bogus __init annotation from DMI callbacks

The __init annotations for the DMI callback functions are wrong as this
code can be called even after the module has been initialized, e.g. like
this:

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/remove
  # modprobe i915
  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan

The first command will remove the PCI device from the kernel's device
list so the second command won't see it right away. But as it registers
a PCI driver it'll see it on the third command. If the system happens to
match one of the DMI table entries we'll try to call a function in long
released memory and generate an Oops, at best.

Fix this by removing the bogus annotation.

Modpost should have caught that one but it ignores section reference
mismatches from the .rodata section. :/
