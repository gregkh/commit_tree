MIPS: NL: Fix nlm_xlp_defconfig build error

The nlm_xlp_defconfig build fails with

./arch/mips/include/asm/mach-netlogic/topology.h:15:0:
			error: "topology_core_id" redefined [-Werror]
In file included from include/linux/smp.h:59:0,
	[ ...]
                 from arch/mips/mm/dma-default.c:12:
./arch/mips/include/asm/smp.h:41:0:
			note: this is the location of the previous definition

and similar errors.

This is caused by commit bda4584cd943d7 ("MIPS: Support CPU topology files
in sysfs") which adds the defines to arch/mips/include/asm/smp.h.

Remove the defines from arch/mips/include/asm/mach-netlogic/topology.h
as no longer necessary.
