block: fix error handling in sg_io

Before commit 2cada584b200 ("block: cleanup error handling in sg_io"),
we had ret = 0 before entering the last big if block of sg_io.

Since 2cada584b200, ret = -EFAULT, which breaks hdparm:

/dev/sda:
 setting Advanced Power Management level to 0xc8 (200)
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD failed: Bad address
 APM_level      = 128
