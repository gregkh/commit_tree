cgroup: clean up sane_behavior handling

After the previous patch to remove sane_behavior support from
non-default hierarchies, CGRP_ROOT_SANE_BEHAVIOR is used only to
indicate the default hierarchy while parsing mount options.  This
patch makes the following cleanups around it.

* Don't show it in the mount option.  Eventually the default hierarchy
  will be assigned a different filesystem type.

* As sane_behavior is no longer effective on non-default hierarchies
  and the default hierarchy doesn't accept any mount options,
  parse_cgroupfs_options() can consider sane_behavior mount option as
  indicating the default hierarchy and fail if any other options are
  specified with it.  While at it, remove one of the double blank
  lines in the function.

* cgroup_mount() can now simply test CGRP_ROOT_SANE_BEHAVIOR to tell
  whether to mount the default hierarchy or not.

* As CGROUP_ROOT_SANE_BEHAVIOR's only role now is indicating whether
  to select the default hierarchy or not during mount, it doesn't need
  to be set in the default hierarchy itself.  cgroup_init_early()
  updated accordingly.
