ASoC: tas5086: add regulator consumer support

The TAS5086 has two power domains, DVDD and AVDD. Enable them both as
long as the codec is in use.

Also, switch on the power to identify the chip at device probe level,
and switch it off again afterwards. The codec level will take care for
power handling later.
