[media] vb2: fix VBI/poll regression

The recent conversion of saa7134 to vb2 unconvered a poll() bug that
broke the teletext applications alevt and mtt. These applications
expect that calling poll() without having called VIDIOC_STREAMON will
cause poll() to return POLLERR. That did not happen in vb2.

This patch fixes that behavior. It also fixes what should happen when
poll() is called when STREAMON is called but no buffers have been
queued. In that case poll() will also return POLLERR, but only for
capture queues since output queues will always return POLLOUT
anyway in that situation.

This brings the vb2 behavior in line with the old videobuf behavior.
