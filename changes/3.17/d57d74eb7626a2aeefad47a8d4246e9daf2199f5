NFC: st21nfca: Implement stop_poll HCI hook

Send DM_DISCONNECT command to disconnect Terminal Host from the HCI network.

- The persistent states of the terminal host pipes, including registry values,
are not modifies. Therefore, there is no NVRAM update to disconnect the
terminal host.
- The terminal host RF card gates are disabled which means that there will be no event
related to card RF gates until communication has been restored.
- The terminal host RF reader request is reset so the RF reader polling for terminal
host is disabled.

To restore the communication, the terminal host can send any HCI command or event.
