net: sctp: Optimise the way 'sctp_arg_t' values are initialised.

Even if memset() is inlined (as on x86) using it to zero the union
generates a memory word write of zero, followed by a write of the
smaller field, and then a read of the word.
As well as being a lot of instructions the sequence is unlikely to
be optimised by the store-load forward hardware so will be slow.

Instead allocate a field of the union that is the same size as the
entire union and write a zero value to it. The compiler will then
generate the required value in a register.

Zeroing the union shouldn't be necessary, but this patch series isn't
intended to have a behavioural change.
