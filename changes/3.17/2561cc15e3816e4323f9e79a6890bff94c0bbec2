xen-netback: Don't deschedule NAPI when carrier off

In the patch called "xen-netback: Turn off the carrier if the guest is not able
to receive" NAPI was descheduled when the carrier was set off. That's
not what most of the drivers do, and we don't have any specific reason to do so
as well, so revert that change.
