MIPS: cpu-info: Change the cpu options variable to unsigned long long

Long integers which are 4 bytes in MIPS32 can't hold new CPU
options anymore, so the type of the 'options' variable is changed
to unsigned long long which allows 32 more cpu options to be defined
for MIPS32

Also, re-arrange the 'options' struct member to avoid potential 4-byte
alignment gap in the middle of the struct.
