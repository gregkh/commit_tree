mmc: wmt-sdmmc: Fix settting BM_EIGHTBIT_MODE bit in wmt_mci_set_ios()

For MMC_BUS_WIDTH_8 case, current code missed setting BM_EIGHTBIT_MODE bit.
Also has a small refactor to make the code looks better in readability.

So the bit settings witch below logic:

SDMMC_BUSMODE register:
Set EIGHTBIT_MODE bit for 8 bit mode, Set FOURBIT_MODE bit for 4 bit mode.
Clear both EIGHTBIT_MODE and FOURBIT_MODE bits for 1 bit mode.

SDMMC_EXTCTRL register:
Set EXT_EIGHTBIT bit for 8 bit mode, Clear EXT_EIGHTBIT bit for 1/4 bit mode.

Add define for EXT_EIGHTBIT to avoid using magic number.
BM_ONEBIT_MASK is no longer used, thus remove it.

This patch is untested due to lack of platform with 8-bit hardware.
However since the code is there, it's good to make the code match the document.
