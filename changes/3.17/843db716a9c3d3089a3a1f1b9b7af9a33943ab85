drm/i915: Collect gtier properly on HSW.

GTIER and DEIER doesn't have same interface on HSW so this "or" operation
makes the information provided useless.

v2: since we have gtier variable already let's split for everybody
and avoid the strange | op.
    Also avoid overriding the value that was set for vlv. In this case I
    believe that we should reorganize the whole function, but I'll respect
    the comment that ask to not touch the order and let this organization
    work to be done later.
v3: moving VLV check to the right place.
