nfsd: fix return of nfs4_acl_write_who

AFAICT, the only way to hit this error is to pass this function a bogus
"who" value. In that case, we probably don't want to return -1 as that
could get sent back to the client. Turn this into nfserr_serverfault,
which is a more appropriate error for a server bug like this.
