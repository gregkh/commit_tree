staging: rtl8188eu: Rename hal_EfusePgPacketRead_8188e() to Efuse_PgPacketRead()

Rename hal_EfusePgPacketRead_8188e() to Efuse_PgPacketRead()
and remove original EFUSE_GetEfuseDefinition() function,
so that driver can call hal_EfusePgPacketRead_8188e() directly
without going through Efuse_PgPacketRead().
