bin2c: move bin2c in scripts/basic

This patch series does not do kernel signature verification yet.  I plan
to post another patch series for that.  Now distributions are already
signing PE/COFF bzImage with PKCS7 signature I plan to parse and verify
those signatures.

Primary goal of this patchset is to prepare groundwork so that kernel
image can be signed and signatures be verified during kexec load.  This
should help with two things.

- It should allow kexec/kdump on secureboot enabled machines.

- In general it can help even without secureboot. By being able to verify
  kernel image signature in kexec, it should help with avoiding module
  signing restrictions. Matthew Garret showed how to boot into a custom
  kernel, modify first kernel's memory and then jump back to old kernel and
  bypass any policy one wants to.

This patch (of 15):

Kexec wants to use bin2c and it wants to use it really early in the build
process. See arch/x86/purgatory/ code in later patches.

So move bin2c in scripts/basic so that it can be built very early and
be usable by arch/x86/purgatory/
