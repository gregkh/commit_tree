KVM: PPC: Expose helper functions for data/inst faults

We're going to implement guest code interpretation in KVM for some rare
corner cases. This code needs to be able to inject data and instruction
faults into the guest when it encounters them.

Expose generic APIs to do this in a reasonably subarch agnostic fashion.
