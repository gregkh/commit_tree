[media] au8522: Fix demod analog mode setting

There are several issues on the current code:
	1) msleep(1) is actually equivalent to msleep(10);
	2) au8522_video_set() will set reg 0xa4 to the
	   proper value for SIF, CVBS or S-Video. No need
	   to force it to CVBS;
	3) Let's not hardcode 0x9d for CBS on audio_set.
