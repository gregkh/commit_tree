[media] cxusb: increase buffer length to 80 bytes

As reported by Vincent:
	[   16.332247] xc2028 0-0061: Loading firmware for type=BASE F8MHZ (3), id 0000000000000000.
	[   16.344378] cxusb: i2c wr: len=64 is too big!

64 bytes is too short for firmware load on this device. So, increase it
to 80 bytes.
