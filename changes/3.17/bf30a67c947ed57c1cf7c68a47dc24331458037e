NFC: digital: Add 'tg_listen_md' and 'tg_get_rf_tech' driver hooks

The digital layer of the NFC subsystem currently
supports a 'tg_listen_mdaa' driver hook that supports
devices that can do mode detection and automatic
anticollision.  However, there are some devices that
can do mode detection but not automatic anitcollision
so add the 'tg_listen_md' hook to support those devices.

In order for the digital layer to get the RF technology
detected by the device from the driver, add the
'tg_get_rf_tech' hook.  It is only valid to call this
hook immediately after a successful call to 'tg_listen_md'.
