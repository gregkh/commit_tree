sg: relax 16 byte cdb restriction

 - remove the 16 byte CDB (SCSI command) length limit from the sg driver
   by handling longer CDBs the same way as the bsg driver. Remove comment
   from sg.h public interface about the cmd_len field being limited to 16
   bytes.
 - remove some dead code caused by this change
 - cleanup comment block at the top of sg.h, fix urls
