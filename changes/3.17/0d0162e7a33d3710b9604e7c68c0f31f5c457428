net: allow macvlans to move to net namespace

I cannot move a macvlan interface created on top of a bonding interface
to a different namespace:

% ip netns add dummy0
% ip link add link bond0 mac0 type macvlan
% ip link set mac0 netns dummy0
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
%

The problem seems to be that commit f9399814927a ("bonding: Don't allow
bond devices to change network namespaces.") sets NETIF_F_NETNS_LOCAL
on bonding interfaces, and commit 797f87f83b60 ("macvlan: fix netdev
feature propagation from lower device") causes macvlan interfaces
to inherit its features from the lower device.

NETIF_F_NETNS_LOCAL should not be inherited from the lower device
by a macvlan.
Patch tested on 3.16.
