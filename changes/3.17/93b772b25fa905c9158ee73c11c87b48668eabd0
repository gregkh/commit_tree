GenWQE: Improve hardware error recovery

Currently, in the event of a fatal hardware error, the driver tries a
recovery procedure that calls pci_reset_function() to reset the card.
This is not sufficient in some cases, needing a fundamental reset to
bring the card back.

This patch implements a call to the platform fundamental reset procedure
on the error recovery path if GENWQE_PLATFORM_ERROR_RECOVERY is enabled.
This is implemented by default only on PPC64, since this can cause
problems on other archs, e.g. zSeries, where the platform has its own
recovery procedures, leading to a potencial race conditition. For these
cases, the recovery is kept as it was before.
