PCI: Add pci_ignore_hotplug() to ignore hotplug events for a device

Powering off a hot-pluggable device, e.g., with pci_set_power_state(D3cold),
normally generates a hot-remove event that unbinds the driver.

Some drivers expect to remain bound to a device even while they power it
off and back on again.  This can be dangerous, because if the device is
removed or replaced while it is powered off, the driver doesn't know that
anything changed.  But some drivers accept that risk.

Add pci_ignore_hotplug() for use by drivers that know their device cannot
be removed.  Using pci_ignore_hotplug() tells the PCI core that hot-plug
events for the device should be ignored.

The radeon and nouveau drivers use this to switch between a low-power,
integrated GPU and a higher-power, higher-performance discrete GPU.  They
power off the unused GPU, but they want to remain bound to it.

This is a reimplementation of f244d8b623da ("ACPIPHP / radeon / nouveau:
Fix VGA switcheroo problem related to hotplug") but extends it to work with
both acpiphp and pciehp.

This fixes a problem where systems with dual GPUs using the radeon drivers
become unusable, freezing every few seconds (see bugzillas below).  The
resume of the radeon device may also fail, e.g.,

This fixes problems on dual GPU systems where the radeon driver becomes
unusable because of problems while suspending the device, as in bug 79701:
