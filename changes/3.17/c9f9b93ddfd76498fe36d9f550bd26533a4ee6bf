libceph: introduce ceph_osdc_cancel_request()

Introduce ceph_osdc_cancel_request() intended for canceling requests
from the higher layers (rbd and cephfs).  Because higher layers are in
charge and are supposed to know what and when they are canceling, the
request is not completed, only unref'ed and removed from the libceph
data structures.

__cancel_request() is no longer called before __unregister_request(),
because __unregister_request() unconditionally revokes r_request and
there is no point in trying to do it twice.
