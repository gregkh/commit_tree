Staging: unisys Remove BROKEN from Kconfig to allow compilation

The unisys drivers now properly check to make sure they are running
on the s-Par platform before they will initialize.  This was fixed in
commit fcd0157ece so it is safe to allow the unisys drivers to be built.

This has been tested in the same qemu environment that originally
produced the panic and the kernel now runs as expected.
