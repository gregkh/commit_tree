Bluetooth: Fix enabling Authenticated Payload Timeout Expired event

The Authenticated Payload Timeout Expired event is valid for
controllers with BR/EDR Secure Connections support, but also for
LE only controllers supporting LE Ping feature. When either of them
is available enable this event. Previous it was not enabled when
the controller was only supporting LE operation.
