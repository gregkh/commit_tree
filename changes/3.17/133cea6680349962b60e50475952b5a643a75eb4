ARM: dts: mvebu: split SolidRun CuBox into variants

As Mainlining effort for SolidRun CuBox has been carried out on the
Engineering Sample, the board DTS was reflecting this. Actually,
SolidRun CuBox comes in three different variants:
Engineering Sample (ES), production with 1GB RAM (1G),
and production with 2GB RAM (2G).

Therefore, we base current dove-cubox.dts on to the 1G production
variant and add a ES dts to add required quirk for misrouted SDHCI
card detect on top of dove-cubox.dts. For the 2G variant we rely on
the bootloader to setup correct RAM size.
