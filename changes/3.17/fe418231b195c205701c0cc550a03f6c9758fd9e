sunsab: Fix detection of BREAK on sunsab serial console

Fix detection of BREAK on sunsab serial console: BREAK detection was only
performed when there were also serial characters received simultaneously.
To handle all BREAKs correctly, the check for BREAK and the corresponding
call to uart_handle_break() must also be done if count == 0, therefore
duplicate this code fragment and pull it out of the loop over the received
characters.

Patch applies to 3.16-rc6.
