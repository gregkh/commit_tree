drm: fix division-by-zero on dumb_create()

Kinda unexpected, but DIV_ROUND_UP() can overflow if passed an argument
bigger than UINT_MAX - DIVISOR. Fix this by testing for "!cpp" before
using it in the following division.

Note that DIV_ROUND_UP() is defined as:
        #define DIV_ROUND_UP(n,d) (((n) + (d) - 1) / (d))

..this will obviously overflow if (n + d - 1) is bigger than UINT_MAX.
