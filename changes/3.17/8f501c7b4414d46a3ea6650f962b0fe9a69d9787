ASoC: samsung: s3c24xx dmaengine follow-up

Commit ae602456e83c92 ("ASoC: samsung: drop support for legacy
S3C24XX DMA API") removed the old code for the samsung specific
DMA interfaces, now that everybody can use dmaengine.

This picks up the few remaining pieces left over by that patch:

The most important one is the removal of the dma_data->ops->started()
calls in ac97. My understanding is that these are only required
for drivers that do not support cyclic transfers, which the new dma
engine driver now does, so we can simply remove them. This would also
fix at least one bug in the ac97 driver on newer machines, which
currently gives us a NULL pointer dereference from trying to call
dma_data->ops->started().

Further, we must no longer 'select' S3C2410_DMA, which conflicts
with the dmaengine driver. The SND_S3C_DMA symbol is now
useless, because it is always selected, so we can remove it
and build the dmaengine support unconditionally.

Finally, we should not 'select' S3C24XX_DMAC or S3C64XX_PL080,
which may have additional dependencies. This replaces it with
'depends on', to be more conservative.
