HID: rmi: make compututation of the address of Query 12 more careful

There are additional queries which are optional and may not be present
depending on the configuration of the firmware. Knowing which queries are
present is needed to properly compute the address of Query 12 and all
subsequent queries. Additional bits in Query 1 are used to indicate the
presence of these optional queries.
