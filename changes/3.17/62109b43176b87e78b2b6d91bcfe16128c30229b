PM / sleep: Fix test_suspend= command line option

After commit d431cbc53cb7 (PM / sleep: Simplify sleep states sysfs
interface code) the pm_states[] array is not populated initially,
which causes setup_test_suspend() to always fail and the suspend
testing during boot doesn't work any more.

Fix the problem by using pm_labels[] instead of pm_states[] in
setup_test_suspend() and storing a pointer to the label of the
sleep state to test rather than the number representing it,
because the connection between the state numbers and labels is
only established by suspend_set_ops().
