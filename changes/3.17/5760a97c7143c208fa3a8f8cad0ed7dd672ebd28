ocfs2/dlm: do not get resource spinlock if lockres is new

There is a deadlock case which reported by Guozhonghua:
  https://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/ocfs2-devel/2014-September/010079.html

This case is caused by &res->spinlock and &dlm->master_lock
misordering in different threads.

It was introduced by commit 8d400b81cc83 ("ocfs2/dlm: Clean up refmap
helpers").  Since lockres is new, it doesn't not require the
&res->spinlock.  So remove it.
