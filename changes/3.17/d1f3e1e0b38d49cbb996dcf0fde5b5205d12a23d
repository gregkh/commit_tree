drm/tegra: Properly align stride for framebuffers

Tegra20 and Tegra30 both required the buffer line stride to be aligned
on 8 byte boundaries. Tegra114 and Tegra124 increased the alignment to
64 bytes. Introduce a parameter to specify the alignment requirements
for each display controller and round up the pitch of newly allocated
framebuffers appropriately.
