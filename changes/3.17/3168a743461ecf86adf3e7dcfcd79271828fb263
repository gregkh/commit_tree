arm64: report correct stack pointer in KSTK_ESP for compat tasks

The KSTK_ESP macro is used to determine the user stack pointer for a
given task. In particular, this is used to to report the '[stack]' VMA
in /proc/self/maps, which is used by Android to determine the stack
location for children of the main thread.

This patch fixes the macro to use user_stack_pointer instead of directly
returning sp. This means that we report w13 instead of sp, since the
former is used as the stack pointer when executing in AArch32 state.
