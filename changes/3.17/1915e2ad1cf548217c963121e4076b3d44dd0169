arm64: vdso: fix build error when switching from LE to BE

Building a kernel with CPU_BIG_ENDIAN fails if there are stale objects
from a !CPU_BIG_ENDIAN build. Due to a missing FORCE prerequisite on an
if_changed rule in the VDSO Makefile, we attempt to link a stale LE
object into the new BE kernel.

According to Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt, FORCE is required for
if_changed rules and forgetting it is a common mistake, so fix it by
'Forcing' the build of vdso. This patch fixes build errors like these:

arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/note.o: compiled for a little endian system and target is big endian
failed to merge target specific data of file arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/note.o

arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/sigreturn.o: compiled for a little endian system and target is big endian
failed to merge target specific data of file arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/sigreturn.o
