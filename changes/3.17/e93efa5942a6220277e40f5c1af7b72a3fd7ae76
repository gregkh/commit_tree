ARM: multi_v7: enable igb, stmpe, lm95245, pwm leds

The NVIDIA Tegra 3 based Apalis T30 module contains an Intel i210 resp.
i211 gigabit Ethernet controller, an STMPE811 ADC/touch controller, PWM
LEDs generically accessible from user space and an LM95245 temperature
sensor chip. The later three can also be found on the Colibri T30
module.

While at it move the NEON entry down to its proper place to have it all
nicely ordered again.
