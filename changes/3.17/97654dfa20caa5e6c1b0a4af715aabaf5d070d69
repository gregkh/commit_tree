slab: defer slab_destroy in free_block()

In free_block(), if freeing object makes new free slab and number of
free_objects exceeds free_limit, we start to destroy this new free slab
with holding the kmem_cache node lock.  Holding the lock is useless and,
generally, holding a lock as least as possible is good thing.  I never
measure performance effect of this, but we'd be better not to hold the
lock as much as possible.

Commented by Christoph:
  This is also good because kmem_cache_free is no longer called while
  holding the node lock. So we avoid one case of recursion.
