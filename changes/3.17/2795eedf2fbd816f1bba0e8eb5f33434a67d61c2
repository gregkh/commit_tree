dmaengine: of: kconfig: select DMA_ENGINE when DMA_OF is selected

Select DMA_ENGINE when DMA_OF is selected since
of_dma_xlate_by_chan_id() from drivers/dma/of-dma.c uses
dma_get_slave_channel() from drivers/dma/dmaengine.c

This resolves error reported:

drivers/built-in.o: In function `of_dma_xlate_by_chan_id':
drivers/dma/of-dma.c:253: undefined reference to `dma_get_slave_channel'
