rbd: rework rbd_request_fn()

While it was never a good idea to sleep in request_fn(), commit
34c6bc2c919a ("locking/mutexes: Add extra reschedule point") made it
a *bad* idea.  mutex_lock() since 3.15 may reschedule *before* putting
task on the mutex wait queue, which for tasks in !TASK_RUNNING state
means block forever.  request_fn() may be called with !TASK_RUNNING on
the way to schedule() in io_schedule().

Offload request handling to a workqueue, one per rbd device, to avoid
calling blocking primitives from rbd_request_fn().
