drm/i915: Add correct hw/sw config check for DSI encoder

Check in vlv_crtc_clock_get if DPLL is enabled before calling dpio read.
It will not be enabled for DSI and avoid dpio read WARN dumps.

Absence of ->get_config was causing other WARN dumps as well. Update
dpll_hw_state as well correctly

v2: Address review comments by Daniel
    - Check if DPLL is enabled rather than checking pipe output type
    - set adjusted_mode->flags to 0 in compute_config rather than using
      pipe_config->quirks
    - Add helper function in intel_dsi_pll.c and use that in intel_dsi.c
    - updated dpll_hw_state correctly
    - Updated commit message and title

v3: Address review comments by Imre
    - Proper masking of P1, M1 fields while computing divisors
    - assert in case of bpp mismatch
    - guard for divide by 0 while computing pclk
    - Use ARRAY_SIZE instead of direct calculation
