USB: add reset resume quirk for usb3503

The usb device will autoresume from choose_wakeup() if it is
autosuspended with the wrong wakeup setting, but below errors occur
because usb3503 misc driver will switch to standby mode when suspended.

As add USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME, it can stop setting wrong wakeup from
autosuspend_check().
