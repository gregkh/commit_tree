tools lib traceevent: Clean up format of args in cfg80211 plugin

While synchronizing what's in trace-cmd vs what's in perf, I came
across a change that was made when entering the cfg80211 plugin into
the tools/lib/traceevent directory. The function prototype went from:

static unsigned long long process___le16_to_cpup(struct trace_seq *s,
						 unsigned long long *args)

to:

static unsigned long long
process___le16_to_cpup(struct trace_seq *s,
		       unsigned long long *args)

I can understand the line break after the long long, but there's no
reason to keep args on a separate line.
