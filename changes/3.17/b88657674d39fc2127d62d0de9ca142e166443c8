ARM: KVM: user_mem_abort: support stage 2 MMIO page mapping

A userspace process can map device MMIO memory via VFIO or /dev/mem,
e.g., for platform device passthrough support in QEMU.

During early development, we found the PAGE_S2 memory type being used
for MMIO mappings.  This patch corrects that by using the more strongly
ordered memory type for device MMIO mappings: PAGE_S2_DEVICE.
