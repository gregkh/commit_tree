HID: logitech-dj: prevent false errors to be shown

Commit "HID: logitech: perform bounds checking on device_id early
enough" unfortunately leaks some errors to dmesg which are not real
ones:
- if the report is not a DJ one, then there is not point in checking
  the device_id
- the receiver (index 0) can also receive some notifications which
  can be safely ignored given the current implementation

Move out the test regarding the report_id and also discards
printing errors when the receiver got notified.
