e1000e: fix trivial kernel doc typos

The macro E1000_success is meant to be E1000_SUCCESS. As the return
statement in the function is good as is, let's simply correct the
comment for this trivial matter.

Additionally E1000_ERR_HOST_INTERFACE_COMMAND is supposed to be
-E1000_ERR_HOST_INTERFACE_COMMAND.
