MIPS: BCM47XX: Fix reboot problem on BCM4705/BCM4785

This adds some code based on code from the Broadcom GPL tar to fix the
reboot problems on BCM4705/BCM4785. I tried rebooting my device for ~10
times and have never seen a problem. This reverts the changes in the
previous commit and adds the real fix as suggested by Rafa≈Ç.

Setting bit 22 in Reg 22, sel 4 puts the BIU (Bus Interface Unit) into
async mode.

BCM47XX: make reboot more relaiable]
