lib/glob.c: add CONFIG_GLOB_SELFTEST

This was useful during development, and is retained for future
regression testing.

GCC appears to have no way to place string literals in a particular
section; adding __initconst to a char pointer leaves the string itself
in the default string section, where it will not be thrown away after
module load.

Thus all string constants are kept in explicitly declared and named
arrays.  Sorry this makes printk a bit harder to read.  At least the
tests are more compact.
