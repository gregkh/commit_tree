macvlan: Allow setting multicast filter on all macvlan types

Currently, macvlan code restricts multicast and unicast
filter setting only to passthru devices.  As a result,
if a guest using macvtap wants to receive multicast
traffic, it has to set IFF_ALLMULTI or IFF_PROMISC.

This patch makes it possible to use the fdb interface
to add multicast addresses to the filter thus allowing
a guest to receive only targeted multicast traffic.
