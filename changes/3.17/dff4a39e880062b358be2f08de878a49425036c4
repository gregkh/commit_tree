powerpc/powernv: Fix IOMMU table for VFIO dev

On PHB3, PCI devices can bypass IOMMU for DMA access. If we pass
through one PCI device, whose hose driver ever enable the bypass
mode, pdev->dev.archdata.dma_data.iommu_table_base isn't IOMMU
table. However, EEH needs access the IOMMU table when the device
is owned by guest.

The patch fixes pdev->dev.archdata.dma_data.iommu_table when
passing through the device to guest in pnv_pci_ioda2_set_bypass().
