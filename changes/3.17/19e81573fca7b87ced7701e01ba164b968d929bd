Fix problem recognizing symlinks

Changeset eb85d94bd introduced a problem where if a cifs open
fails during query info of a file we
will still try to close the file (happens with certain types
of reparse points) even though the file handle is not valid.

In addition for SMB2/SMB3 we were not mapping the return code returned
by Windows when trying to open a file (like a Windows NFS symlink)
which is a reparse point.
