Btrfs: clone, don't create invalid hole extent map

When cloning a file that consists of an inline extent, we were creating
an extent map that represents a non-existing trailing hole starting at a
file offset that isn't a multiple of the sector size. This happened because
when processing an inline extent we weren't aligning the extent's length to
the sector size, and therefore incorrectly treating the range
[inline_extent_length; sector_size[ as a hole.
