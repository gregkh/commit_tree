arch/x86/xen: Silence compiler warnings

Compiler complains in the following way when x86 32-bit kernel
with Xen support is build:

  CC      arch/x86/xen/enlighten.o
arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c: In function ‘xen_start_kernel’:
arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1726:3: warning: right shift count >= width of type [enabled by default]

Such line contains following EFI initialization code:

boot_params.efi_info.efi_systab_hi = (__u32)(__pa(efi_systab_xen) >> 32);

There is no issue if x86 64-bit kernel is build. However, 32-bit case
generate warning (even if that code will not be executed because Xen
does not work on 32-bit EFI platforms) due to __pa() returning unsigned long
type which has 32-bits width. So move whole EFI initialization stuff
to separate function and build it conditionally to avoid above mentioned
warning on x86 32-bit architecture.
