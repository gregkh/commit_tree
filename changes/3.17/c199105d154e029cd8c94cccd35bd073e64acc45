net-timestamp: only report sw timestamp if reporting bit is set

The timestamping API has separate bits for generating and reporting
timestamps. A software timestamp should only be reported for a packet
when the packet has the relevant generation flag (SKBTX_..) set
and the socket has reporting bit SOF_TIMESTAMPING_SOFTWARE set.

The second check was accidentally removed. Reinstitute the original
behavior.

Tested:
  Without this patch, Documentation/networking/txtimestamp reports
  timestamps regardless of whether SOF_TIMESTAMPING_SOFTWARE is set.
  After the patch, it only reports them when the flag is set.
