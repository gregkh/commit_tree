wlcore: user smaller sqn padding for GEM

On recovery, we increase the current seq num by
WL1271_TX_SQN_POST_RECOVERY_PADDING in order to
compensate for packets we might have missed during
recovery.

It seems that some GEM APs have issues when the
gap is too big, so use a smaller padding in this case.
