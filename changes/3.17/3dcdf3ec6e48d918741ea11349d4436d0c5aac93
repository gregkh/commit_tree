KVM: nVMX: Allow to disable CR3 access interception

We already have this control enabled by exposing a broken
MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS value. This will properly advertise our
capability once the value is fixed by clearing the right bits in
MSR_IA32_VMX_TRUE_PROCBASED_CTLS. We also have to ensure to test the
right value on L2 entry.
