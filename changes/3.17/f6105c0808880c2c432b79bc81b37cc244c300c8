[SCSI] save command pool address of Scsi_Host

If a scsi host driver specifies .cmd_len in it's scsi_host_template, a driver's
private command pool is needed. scsi_find_host_cmd_pool() will locate it, but
scsi_alloc_host_cmd_pool() isn't saving the pool address in the host template.

This will result in an access error when the host is removed.

Avoid the problem by saving the address of a new allocated command pool where
it is expected.
