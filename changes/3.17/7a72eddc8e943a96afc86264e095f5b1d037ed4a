tlan: Don't disable internal PHY on cards that use it in 10 Mbps mode

In tlan_reset_adapter, we disable internal PHY when an external one is used.
On cards which use internal PHY in 10 Mbps mode, we enable it later when
setting 10 Mbps mode but it does not really work (PHY fails to reset).
Leave it enabled instead.
