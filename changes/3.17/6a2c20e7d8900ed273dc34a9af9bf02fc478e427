kexec: support kexec/kdump on EFI systems

This patch does two things.  It passes EFI run time mappings to second
kernel in bootparams efi_info.  Second kernel parse this info and create
new mappings in second kernel.  That means mappings in first and second
kernel will be same.  This paves the way to enable EFI in kexec kernel.

This patch also prepares and passes EFI setup data through bootparams.
This contains bunch of information about various tables and their
addresses.

These information gathering and passing has been written along the lines
of what current kexec-tools is doing to make kexec work with UEFI.
