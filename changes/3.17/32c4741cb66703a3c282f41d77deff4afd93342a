KEYS: validate certificate trust only with builtin keys

Instead of allowing public keys, with certificates signed by any
key on the system trusted keyring, to be added to a trusted keyring,
this patch further restricts the certificates to those signed only by
builtin keys on the system keyring.

This patch defines a new option 'builtin' for the kernel parameter
'keys_ownerid' to allow trust validation using builtin keys.

Simplified Mimi's "KEYS: define an owner trusted keyring" patch

Changelog v7:
- rename builtin_keys to use_builtin_keys
