lib: bitmap: make nbits parameter of bitmap_{and,or,xor,andnot} unsigned

This change is only for consistency with the changes to the other
bitmap_* functions; it doesn't change the size of the generated code:
inside BITS_TO_LONGS there is a sizeof(long), which causes bits to be
interpreted as unsigned anyway.
