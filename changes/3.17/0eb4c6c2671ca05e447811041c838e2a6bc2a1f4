gpio: move sysfs support to its own file

sysfs support is currently entangled within the core GPIO support, while
it should relly just be a (privileged) user of the integer GPIO API.
This patch is a first step towards making the gpiolib code more readable
by splitting it into logical parts.

Move all sysfs support to their own source file, and share static
members of gpiolib that need to be in the private gpiolib.h file. In
the future we will want to put some of them back into gpiolib.c, but this
first patch let us at least identify them.
