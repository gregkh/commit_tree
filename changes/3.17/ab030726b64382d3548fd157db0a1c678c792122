HID: sony: Remove an old and redundant comment

Remove an old redundant comment before sony_report_fixup(), it must have
been a leftover from the first version of the driver:
sony_report_fixup() now handles all the supported devices, not only the
Sony Vaio VGX.

The comment is also redundant as the same information provided by it is
also present in the body of the function.
