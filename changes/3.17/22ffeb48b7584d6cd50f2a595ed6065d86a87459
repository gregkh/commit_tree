scsi_scan: Restrict sequential scan to 256 LUNs

Sequential scan for more than 256 LUNs is very fragile as
LUNs might not be numbered sequentially after that point.

SAM revisions later than SCSI-3 impose a structure on
LUNs larger than 256, making LUN numbers between 256
and 16384 illegal.
SCSI-3, however allows for plain 64-bit numbers with
no internal structure.

So restrict sequential LUN scan to 256 LUNs and add a
new blacklist flag 'BLIST_SCSI3LUN' to scan up to
max_lun devices.
