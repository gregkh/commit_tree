ASoC: fsl_spdif: Add stream names for DPCM usage

DPCM needs extra dapm routes in the machine driver to route audio
between Front-End and Back-End. In order to differ the stream names
in the route map from CODECs, we here add specific stream names to
SPDIF driver so that we can implement ASRC via DPCM to it.
