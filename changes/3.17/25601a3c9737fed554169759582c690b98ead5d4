UBIFS: Add log overlap assertions

We use a circle area to record the log nodes in ubifs. This log area
should not be overlapped. But after researching the code, I found
some conditions may lead log head wraps log ltail. Although we've
fixed the problems discovered, there may be some other issues still
left.

This patch adds assertions where lhead changes to next leb to make
sure ltail is not wrapped.
