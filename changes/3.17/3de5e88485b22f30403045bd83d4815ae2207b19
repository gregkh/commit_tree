workqueue: clear POOL_DISASSOCIATED in rebind_workers()

a9ab775bcadf ("workqueue: directly restore CPU affinity of workers
from CPU_ONLINE") moved pool locking into rebind_workers() but left
"pool->flags &= ~POOL_DISASSOCIATED" in workqueue_cpu_up_callback().

There is nothing necessarily wrong with it, but there is no benefit
either.  Let's move it into rebind_workers() and achieve the following
benefits:

  1) better readability, POOL_DISASSOCIATED is cleared in rebind_workers()
     as expected.

  2) we can guarantee that, when POOL_DISASSOCIATED is clear, the
     running workers of the pool are on the local CPU (pool->cpu).
