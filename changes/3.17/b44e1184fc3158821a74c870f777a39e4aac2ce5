drbd: debugfs: add version tag to debugfs files

Make the first line of debugfs files a version number,
starting now with "v: 0".

If we change content of presentation, we will bump that.
Monitoring or diagnostic scritps that may parse these files
can then easily know when they need to be reviewed.
