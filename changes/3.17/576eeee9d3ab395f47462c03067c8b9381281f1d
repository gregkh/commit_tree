iwlwifi: mvm: add some missing iwl_mvm_ref_sync() calls

Add iwl_mvm_ref_sync() calls (with new ref types) to
flows that might access the device directly.

These calls make sure the device is out of d0i3,
and the bus is available for direct access.

Since some of these functions are reentrant, convert
the refs_bitmap to a ref counter, so multiple refs
of the same type could be taken concurrently.
