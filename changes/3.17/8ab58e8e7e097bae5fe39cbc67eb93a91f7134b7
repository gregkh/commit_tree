ACPI / video: Fix backlight taking 2 steps on a brightness up/down keypress

In various scenarious userspace will respond to brightness up/down keypresses
by increasing/decreasing the backlight brightness itself. If the kernel then
also changes the brightness this results in the brightness having changed 2
steps for a single keypress which is undesirable. See e.g. :

https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnome-settings-daemon/+bug/527157
http://askubuntu.com/questions/173921/why-does-my-thinkpad-brightness-control-skip-steps

This commit delays responding to brightness up/down keypresses by 100 ms and
if userspace in that time responds by changing the backlight itself, cancels
the kernels own handling of these keypresses, fixing the 2 steps issue.

 acpi_video_device instead of having it as a global]

 delay the keypress handling]
