ARM: tegra: initial support for apalis t30

This patch adds the device tree to support Toradex Apalis T30, a
computer on module which can be used on different carrier boards.

The module consists of a Tegra 3 SoC, two PMICs, 1 or 2 GB of DDR3L
RAM, eMMC, an LM95245 temperature sensor chip, an i210 resp. i211
gigabit Ethernet controller, an STMPE811 ADC/touch controller as well
as two MCP2515 CAN controllers. Furthermore, there is an SGTL5000 audio
codec which is not yet supported. Anything that is not self contained
on the module is disabled by default.

The device tree for the Evaluation Board includes the modules device
tree and enables the supported peripherals of the carrier board (the
Evaluation Board supports almost all of them).

While at it also add the device tree binding documentation for Apalis
T30.
