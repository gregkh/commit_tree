team: fix releasing uninitialized pointer to BPF prog

Commit 34c5bd66e5ed introduced the possibility that an
uninitialized pointer on the stack (orig_fp) can call into
sk_unattached_filter_destroy() when its value is non NULL.

Before that commit orig_fp was only destroyed in the same
block where it was assigned a valid BPF prog before. Fix it
up by initializing it to NULL.
