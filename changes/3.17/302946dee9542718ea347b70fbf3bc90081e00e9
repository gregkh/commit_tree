ARM: dts: am437x-gp-evm: Don't use read/write wait monitoring

NAND uses wait pin only to indicate device readiness after
a block/page operation. It is not use to extend individual
read/write cycle and so read/write wait pin monitoring must
be disabled for NAND.

This patch also gets rid of the below warning when NAND is
accessed for the first time.
