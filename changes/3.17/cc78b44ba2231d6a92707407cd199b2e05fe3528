Bluetooth: Skip unconfigured init procedure for raw-only devices

When the driver sets HCI_QUIRK_RAW_DEVICE, the controller will be set
as unconfigured. However running the unconfigured init procecure is
not useful since raw-only devices are not allowed to change its
configuration. This change skips the init procedure and just allows
user channel operation for this device.
