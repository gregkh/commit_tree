nfsd: clean up races in lock stateid searching and creation

Preparation for removal of the client_mutex.

Currently, no lock aside from the client_mutex is held when calling
find_lock_state. Ensure that the cl_lock is held by adding a lockdep
assertion.

Once we remove the client_mutex, it'll be possible for another thread to
race in and insert a lock state for the same file after we search but
before we insert a new one. Ensure that doesn't happen by redoing the
search after allocating a new stid that we plan to insert. If one is
found just put the one that was allocated.
