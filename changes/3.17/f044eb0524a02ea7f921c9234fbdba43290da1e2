Bluetooth: Store latency and supervision timeout in connection params

When the slave updates the connection parameters, store also the
connection latency and supervision timeout information in the
internal list of connection parameters for known devices.

Having these values available allowes the auto-connection
procedure to use the correct values from the beginning without
having to request an update on every connection establishment.
