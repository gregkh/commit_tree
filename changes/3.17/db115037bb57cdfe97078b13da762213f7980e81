net: fix checksum features handling in netif_skb_features()

This is follow-up to

  da08143b8520 ("vlan: more careful checksum features handling")

which introduced more careful feature intersection in vlan code,
taking into account that HW_CSUM should be considered superset
of IP_CSUM/IPV6_CSUM. The same is needed in netif_skb_features()
in order to avoid offloading mismatch warning when vlan is
created on top of a bond consisting of slaves supporting IP/IPv6
checksumming but not vlan Tx offloading.
