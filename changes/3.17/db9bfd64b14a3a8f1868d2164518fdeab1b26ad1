[SCSI] libiscsi: fix potential buffer overrun in __iscsi_conn_send_pdu

This patches fixes a potential buffer overrun in __iscsi_conn_send_pdu.
This function is used by iscsi drivers and userspace to send iscsi PDUs/
commands. For login commands, we have a set buffer size. For all other
commands we do not support data buffers.
