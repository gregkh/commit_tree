iio: adc: at91: don't use the last converted data register

If touchscreen mode is enabled and a conversion is requested on another
channel, the result in the last converted data register can be a
touchscreen relative value. Starting a conversion involves to do a
conversion for all active channel. It starts with ADC channels and ends
with touchscreen channels. Then if ADC_LCD register is not read quickly,
its content may be a touchscreen conversion.
To remove this temporal constraint, the conversion value is taken from
the channel data register.
