ACPICA: Utilities: Introduce acpi_log_error() to improve portability

Invocations like fprintf(stderr) and perror() are not portable, this patch
introduces acpi_log_error() as a replacement, it is implemented using new
portable API - acpi_ut_file_vprintf().

Note that though acpi_os_initialize() need to be invoked prior than using
this new API, since no users are introduced in this patch, such invocations
are not added for applications that link utprint.c in this patch. Futher
patches that introduce users of acpi_log_error() should take care of this.

This patch is only useful for ACPICA applications, most of which are not
shipped in the Linux kernel.

Note that follow-up commits will update acpidump to use this new API to
improve portability. Lv Zheng.
