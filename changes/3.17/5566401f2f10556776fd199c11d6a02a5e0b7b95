stmmac: ptp: fix the reference clock

The PTP reference clock, used for setting the addend in the Timestamp Addend
Register, was erroneously hard-coded (as reported in the databook just as
example).

The patch removes the macro named: STMMAC_SYSCLOCK and allows to use a
reference clock (clk_ptp_ref_i) that can be passed from the platform.

If not passed, the main driver clock will be used as default; note that
this can be fine on some platforms.

Note that, prior this patch, using the old STMMAC_SYSCLOCK on some platforms,
as side effect, the ptp clock can move faster/slower than the system clock.
