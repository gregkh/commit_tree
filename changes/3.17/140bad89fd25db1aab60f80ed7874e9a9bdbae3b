KVM: x86: emulation of dword cmov on long-mode should clear [63:32]

Even if the condition of cmov is not satisfied, bits[63:32] should be cleared.
This is clearly stated in Intel's CMOVcc documentation.  The solution is to
reassign the destination onto itself if the condition is unsatisfied.  For that
matter the original destination value needs to be read.
