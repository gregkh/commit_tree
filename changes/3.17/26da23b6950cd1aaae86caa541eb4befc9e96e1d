mac80211: add functions to stop and wake all queues assigned to a vif

In some cases we may want to stop the queues of a single vif (for
instance during a channel-switch).  Add a function that stops all the
queues that are assigned to a vif.  If a queue is assigned to more
than one vif, the corresponding netdev subqueue of the other vif(s)
will also be stopped.  If the HW doesn't set the
IEEE80211_HW_QUEUE_CONTROL flag, then all queues are stopped.

Also add a corresponding function to wake the queues of a vif back.
