sparc64: remove macro indirection in io_64.h

Most likely for historical reasons io_64.h used an
extra layer of macro indirections.

Fix it so we no longer use these indirections.
In the process we loose a cast to the addr argument for in*()/out*()
but all known affected users has already been fixed so
no warnings are triggered.

For each of the IO functions add a proper define like this:

    #define inb inb

This is done to make the code compatible with the way these
functions are defined in asm-generic/io.h with the objective
to later introduce the generic io.h for sparc64.
