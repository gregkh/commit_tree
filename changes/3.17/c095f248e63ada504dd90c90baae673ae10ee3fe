bridge: Fix br_should_learn to check vlan_enabled

As Toshiaki Makita pointed out, the BRIDGE_INPUT_SKB_CB will
not be initialized in br_should_learn() as that function
is called only from br_handle_local_finish().  That is
an input handler for link-local ethernet traffic so it perfectly
correct to check br->vlan_enabled here.
