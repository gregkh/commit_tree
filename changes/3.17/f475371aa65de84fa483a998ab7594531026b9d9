ALSA: hda - restore the gpio led after resume

On some HP laptops, the mute led is controlled by codec gpio.

When some machine resume from s3/s4, the codec gpio data will be
cleared to 0 by BIOS:
Before suspend:
  IO[3]: enable=1, dir=1, wake=0, sticky=0, data=1, unsol=0
After resume:
  IO[3]: enable=1, dir=1, wake=0, sticky=0, data=0, unsol=0

To skip the AFG node to enter D3 can't fix this problem.

A workaround is to restore the gpio data when the system resume
back from s3/s4. It is safe even on the machines without this
problem.
