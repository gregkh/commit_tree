[SCSI] fix for bidi use after free

When ending a bi-directionional SCSI request, blk_finish_request()
cleans up and frees the request, but scsi_release_bidi_buffers() tries
to indirect through the request to find it's data buffers.  This causes
a panic due to a null pointer dereference.

Move the call to scsi_release_bidi_buffers() before the call to
blk_finish_request().
