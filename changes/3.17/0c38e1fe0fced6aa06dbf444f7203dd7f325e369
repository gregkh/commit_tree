lib: turn CONFIG_STACKTRACE into an actual option.

I was puzzled why /proc/$$/stack had disappeared, until I figured out I
had disabled the last debug option that did a 'select STACKTRACE'.  This
patch makes the option show up at config time, so it can be enabled
without enabling any of the more heavyweight debug options.
