signal: Explain local_irq_save() call

The explicit local_irq_save() in __lock_task_sighand() is needed to avoid
a potential deadlock condition, as noted in a841796f11c90d53 (signal:
align __lock_task_sighand() irq disabling and RCU).  However, someone
reading the code might be forgiven for concluding that this separate
local_irq_save() was completely unnecessary.  This commit therefore adds
a comment referencing the shiny new block comment on rcu_read_unlock().
