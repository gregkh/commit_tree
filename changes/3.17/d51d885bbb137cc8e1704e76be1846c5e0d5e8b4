mm: huge_memory: use GFP_TRANSHUGE when charging huge pages

Transparent huge page charges prefer falling back to regular pages
rather than spending a lot of time in direct reclaim.

Desired reclaim behavior is usually declared in the gfp mask, but THP
charges use GFP_KERNEL and then rely on the fact that OOM is disabled
for THP charges, and that OOM-disabled charges don't retry reclaim.
Needless to say, this is anything but obvious and quite error prone.

Convert THP charges to use GFP_TRANSHUGE instead, which implies
__GFP_NORETRY, to indicate the low-latency requirement.
