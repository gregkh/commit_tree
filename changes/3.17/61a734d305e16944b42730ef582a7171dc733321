xen/manage: Always freeze/thaw processes when suspend/resuming

Always freeze processes when suspending and thaw processes when resuming
to prevent a race noticeable with HVM guests.

This prevents a deadlock where the khubd kthread (which is designed to
be freezable) acquires a usb device lock and then tries to allocate
memory which requires the disk which hasn't been resumed yet.
Meanwhile, the xenwatch thread deadlocks waiting for the usb device
lock.

Freezing processes fixes this because the khubd thread is only thawed
after the xenwatch thread finishes resuming all the devices.
