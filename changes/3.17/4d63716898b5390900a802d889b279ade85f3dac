fnic: reject device resets without assigned tags for the blk-mq case

Current the midlayer fakes up a struct request for the explicit reset
ioctls, and those don't have a tag allocated to them.  The fnic driver pokes
into midlayer structures to paper over this design issue, but that won't
work for the blk-mq case.

Either someone who can actually test the hardware will have to come up with
a similar hack for the blk-mq case, or we'll have to bite the bullet and fix
the way the EH ioctls work for real, but until that happens we fail these
explicit requests here.
