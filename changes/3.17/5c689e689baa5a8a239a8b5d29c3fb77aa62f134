staging/lustre/ptlrpc: race at req processing

Race between ptlrpc_resend_req() and ptlrpc_check_set().
1 thread do ptlrpc_check_set()->after_reply()
2 thread do ptlrpc_resend_req()
The result is request with rq_resend = 1 and MSG_REPLY flag.
When this request will came to server it will cause client eviction.
The patch skip ptlrpc_resend_req logic if rq_replied is set,
and clear rq_resend flag at reply_in_callback() when client got
reply.
