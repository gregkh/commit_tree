ASoC: fsi: use dmaengine_prep_dma_cyclic() for DMA transfer

Current FSI driver is using DMAEngine directly,
but, ASoC is requesting to use common DMA transfer method,
like snd_dmaengine_pcm_trigger() or dmaengine_pcm_ops.
It is difficult to switch at this point, since Renesas
driver is also supporting PIO transfer.
This patch uses dmaengine_prep_dma_cyclic() instead
of dmaengine_prep_slave_single().
It is used in requested method,
and is good first step to switch over.
