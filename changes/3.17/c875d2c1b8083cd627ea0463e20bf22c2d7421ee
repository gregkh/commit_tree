iommu/vt-d: Exclude devices using RMRRs from IOMMU API domains

The user of the IOMMU API domain expects to have full control of
the IOVA space for the domain.  RMRRs are fundamentally incompatible
with that idea.  We can neither map the RMRR into the IOMMU API
domain, nor can we guarantee that the device won't continue DMA with
the area described by the RMRR as part of the new domain.  Therefore
we must prevent such devices from being used by the IOMMU API.
