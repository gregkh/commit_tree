ASoC: fsl: refine DMA/FIQ dependencies

Commit 31ee2bfd724ab ("ASoC: fsl: select SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_DMA
where needed") started selecting SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_DMA and
SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ for two drivers when building for i.MX.
This has turned out too aggressive, as FIQ is only available
for i.mx2 through i.mx5, but not i.mx6 or vybrid.

Further, two more drivers have become user-selectable in the
meantime, and they both depend on DMA for the imx platform
as well.

This changes the selection of FIQ to depend on the TZIC or
AVIC interrupt controllers that actually export the imx
specific FIQ interfaces, and adds the missing select statements
for SAI and ESAI.
