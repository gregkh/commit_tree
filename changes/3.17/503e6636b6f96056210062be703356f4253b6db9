asm-generic: add memfd_create system call to unistd.h

Commit 9183df25fe7b ("shm: add memfd_create() syscall") added a new
system call (memfd_create) but didn't update the asm-generic unistd
header.

This patch adds the new system call to the asm-generic version of
unistd.h so that it can be used by architectures such as arm64.
