md/raid1:  be more cautious where we read-balance during resync.

commit 79ef3a8aa1cb1523cc231c9a90a278333c21f761 made
it possible for reads to happen concurrently with resync.
This means that we need to be more careful where read_balancing
is allowed during resync - we can no longer be sure that any
resync that has already started will definitely finish.

So keep read_balancing to before recovery_cp, which is conservative
but safe.

This bug makes it possible to read from a device that doesn't
have up-to-date data, so it can cause data corruption.
So it is suitable for any kernel since 3.11.
