timerfd: Use ktime_mono_to_real()

We have a few other use cases of ktime_get_monotonic_offset() which
can be optimized with ktime_mono_to_real(). The timerfd code uses the
offset only for comparison, so we can use ktime_mono_to_real(0) for
this as well.

Funny enough text size shrinks with that on ARM and x8664 !?
