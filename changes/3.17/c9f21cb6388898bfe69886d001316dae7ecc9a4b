crypto: ccp - Check for CCP before registering crypto algs

If the ccp is built as a built-in module, then ccp-crypto (whether
built as a module or a built-in module) will be able to load and
it will register its crypto algorithms.  If the system does not have
a CCP this will result in -ENODEV being returned whenever a command
is attempted to be queued by the registered crypto algorithms.

Add an API, ccp_present(), that checks for the presence of a CCP
on the system.  The ccp-crypto module can use this to determine if it
should register it's crypto alogorithms.
