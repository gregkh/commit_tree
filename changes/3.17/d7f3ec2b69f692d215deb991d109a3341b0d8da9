ARM: mvebu: add CA9 MPcore SoC Controller node

The CA9 MPcore SoC Control block is a set of registers that allows to
configure certain internal aspects of the core blocks of the SoC
(Cortex-A9, L2 cache controller, etc.). In most cases, the default
values are fine so they aren't many reasons to touch those registers,
but there is one exception: to support cpuidle on Armada 38x, we need
to modify the value of the CA9 MPcore Reset Control register.

Therefore, this commit adds a new Device Tree binding for this
hardware block, and uses this new binding for the Armada 38x Device
Tree file.
