kernel: time: Add udelay_test module to validate udelay

Create a module that allows udelay() to be executed to ensure that
it is delaying at least as long as requested (with a little bit of
error allowed).

There are some configurations which don't have reliably udelay
due to using a loop delay with cpufreq changes which should use
a counter time based delay instead.  This test aims to identify
those configurations where timing is unreliable.
