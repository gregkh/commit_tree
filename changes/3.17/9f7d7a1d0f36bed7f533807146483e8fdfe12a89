drivers/rtc/rtc-tps65910.c: fix potential NULL-pointer dereference

The interrupt handler gets the driver data associated with the RTC
device and doesn't check it for validity.  This can cause a NULL pointer
being dereferenced when and interrupt fires before the driver data was
properly set up.

Fix this by setting the driver data earlier (before the interrupt is
requested).
