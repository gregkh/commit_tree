iwlwifi: mvm: correctly handle PM/QoS changes from mac80211

When mac80211 requests multiple BSS config changes, as for example
while associating, we ignore power management and QoS changes and
only apply them later. Fix that by removing the "else" and making
the conditions independent.

Also move it after (potential) beacon filter enablement to have
that already enabled when going into power management code.
