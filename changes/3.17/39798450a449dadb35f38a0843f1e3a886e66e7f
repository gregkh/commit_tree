staging: comedi: ni_670x: remove COMEDI_MITE and HAS_DMA dependancy

The mite module provides the DMA interface for the PCI MITE ASIC used on
many National Instruments DAQ boards. This driver does not use DMA and only
depends on the mite module to initialize the MITE ASIC.

Handle the initialization localy and remove the unnecessary dependancies.
