staging: lustre: remove proc function wrappers

ll_proc_dointvec and ll_proc_dolongvec didn't do anything except confuse
things due to a lack of a filep variable in the functions they were used
in.  So remove them and just call the real proc functions.  This enabled
the code to be unwound a bit and a few "empty" proc handlers were
removed and just passed directly to procfs instead.
