staging/nvec: Do not pass resource to mfd_add_devices()

The mfd_add_devices() function takes a struct resource * as fifth
argument, but the nvec driver passes in a void __iomem *. The driver
gets away with it because none of the subdevices ever directly access
the registers.

Since subdevices never need to access the registers we can simply pass
NULL instead.
