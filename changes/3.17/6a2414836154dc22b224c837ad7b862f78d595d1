block: use kmalloc alignment for bio slab

Various subsystems can ask the bio subsystem to create a bio slab cache
with some free space before the bio.  This free space can be used for any
purpose.  Device mapper uses this per-bio-data feature to place some
target-specific and device-mapper specific data before the bio, so that
the target-specific data doesn't have to be allocated separately.

This per-bio-data mechanism is used in place of kmalloc, so we need the
allocated slab to have the same memory alignment as memory allocated
with kmalloc.

Change bio_find_or_create_slab() so that it uses ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN
alignment when creating the slab cache.  This is needed so that dm-crypt
can use per-bio-data for encryption - the crypto subsystem assumes this
data will have the same alignment as kmalloc'ed memory.
