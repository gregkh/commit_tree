net: sctp: implement rfc6458, 5.3.6. SCTP_NXTINFO cmsg support

This patch implements section 5.3.6. of RFC6458, that is, support
for 'SCTP Next Receive Information Structure' (SCTP_NXTINFO) which
is placed into ancillary data cmsghdr structure for each recvmsg()
call, if this information is already available when delivering the
current message.

This option can be enabled/disabled via setsockopt(2) on SOL_SCTP
level by setting an int value with 1/0 for SCTP_RECVNXTINFO in
user space applications as per RFC6458, section 8.1.30.

The sctp_nxtinfo structure is defined as per RFC as below ...

  struct sctp_nxtinfo {
    uint16_t nxt_sid;
    uint16_t nxt_flags;
    uint32_t nxt_ppid;
    uint32_t nxt_length;
    sctp_assoc_t nxt_assoc_id;
  };

... and provided under cmsg_level IPPROTO_SCTP, cmsg_type
SCTP_NXTINFO, while cmsg_data[] contains struct sctp_nxtinfo.

Joint work with Daniel Borkmann.
