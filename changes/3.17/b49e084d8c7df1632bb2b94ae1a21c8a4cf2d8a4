nfsd: do filp_close in sc_free callback for lock stateids

Releasing locks when we unhash the stateid instead of doing so only when
the stateid is actually released will be problematic in later patches
when we need to protect the unhashing with spinlocks. Move it into the
sc_free operation instead.
