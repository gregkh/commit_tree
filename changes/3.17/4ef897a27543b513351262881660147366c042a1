xfs: flush both inodes in xfs_swap_extents

We need to treat both inodes identically from a page cache point of
view when prepareing them for extent swapping. We don't do this
right now - we assume that one of the inodes empty, because that's
what xfs_fsr currently does. Remove this assumption from the code.

While factoring out the flushing and related checks, move the
transactions reservation to immeidately after the flushes so that we
don't need to pick up and then drop the ilock to do the transaction
reservation. There are no issues with aborting the transaction it if
the checks fail before we join the inodes to the transaction and
dirty them, so this is a safe change to make.
