drm/i915: Fix crash when failing to parse MIPI VBT

This particular nasty presented itself while trying to register the
intelfb device (intel_fbdev.c). During the process of registering the device
the driver will disable the crtc via i9xx_crtc_disable. These will
also disable the panel using the generic mipi panel functions in
dsi_mod_vbt_generic.c. The stale MIPI generic data sequence pointers would
cause a crash within those functions. However, all of this is happening
while console_lock is held from do_register_framebuffer inside fbcon.c. Which
means that you got kernel log and just the device appearing to reboot/hang for
no apparent reason.

The fault started from the FB_EVENT_FB_REGISTERED event using the
fb_notifier_call_chain call in fbcon.c.

This regression has been introduced in
