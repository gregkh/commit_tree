drbd: fix bogus resync stats in /proc/drbd

We intentionally do not serialize /proc/drbd access with
internal state changes or statistic updates.

Because of that, cat /proc/drbd  may race with resync just being
finished, still see the sync state, and find information about
number of blocks still to go, but then find the total number
of blocks within this resync has just been reset to 0
when accessing it.

This now produces bogus numbers in the resync speed estimates.

Fix by accessing all relevant data only once,
and fixing it up if "still to go" happens to be more than "total".
