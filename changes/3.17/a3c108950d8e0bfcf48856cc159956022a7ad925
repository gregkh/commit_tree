btrfs: fix leak in qgroup_subtree_accounting() error path

Coverity pointed this out; in the newly added
qgroup_subtree_accounting(), if btrfs_find_all_roots()
returns an error, we leak at least the parents pointer,
and possibly the roots pointer, depending on what failure
occurs.

If btrfs_find_all_roots() returns an error, we need to
free up all allocations before we return.  "roots" is
initialized to NULL, so it should be safe to free
it unconditionally (ulist_free() handles that case).
