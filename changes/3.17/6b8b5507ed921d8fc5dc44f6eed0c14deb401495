sparc64: update IO access functions in PeeCeeI

The PeeCeeI.c code used in*() + out*() for IO access.
But these are in little endian and the native (big) endian
result was required which resulted in some bit-shifting.
Shift the code over to use the __raw_*() variants all over.

This simplifies the code as we can drop the calls
to le16_to_cpu() and le32_to_cpu().
And it should be a little faster too.

With this change we now uses the same type of IO access functions
in all of the file.
