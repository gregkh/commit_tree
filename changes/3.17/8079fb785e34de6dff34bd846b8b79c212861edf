xprtrdma: Handle additional connection events

Commit 38ca83a5 added RDMA_CM_EVENT_TIMEWAIT_EXIT. But that status
is relevant only for consumers that re-use their QPs on new
connections. xprtrdma creates a fresh QP on reconnection, so that
event should be explicitly ignored.

Squelch the alarming "unexpected CM event" message.
