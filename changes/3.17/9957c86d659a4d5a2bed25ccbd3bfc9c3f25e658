KVM: Move all accesses to kvm::irq_routing into irqchip.c

Now that struct _irqfd does not keep a reference to storage pointed
to by the irq_routing field of struct kvm, we can move the statement
that updates it out from under the irqfds.lock and put it in
kvm_set_irq_routing() instead.  That means we then have to take a
srcu_read_lock on kvm->irq_srcu around the irqfd_update call in
kvm_irqfd_assign(), since holding the kvm->irqfds.lock no longer
ensures that that the routing can't change.

Combined with changing kvm_irq_map_gsi() and kvm_irq_map_chip_pin()
to take a struct kvm * argument instead of the pointer to the routing
table, this allows us to to move all references to kvm->irq_routing
into irqchip.c.  That in turn allows us to move the definition of the
kvm_irq_routing_table struct into irqchip.c as well.
