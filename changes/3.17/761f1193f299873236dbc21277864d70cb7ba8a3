virtio-scsi: Implement change_queue_depth for virtscsi targets

change_queue_depth allows changing per-target queue depth via sysfs.

It also allows the SCSI midlayer to ramp down the number of concurrent
inflight requests in response to a SCSI BUSY status response and allows
the midlayer to ramp the count back up to the device maximum when the
BUSY condition has resolved.
