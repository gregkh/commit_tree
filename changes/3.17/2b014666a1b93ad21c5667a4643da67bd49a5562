PM / Sleep: Remove ftrace_stop/start() from suspend and hibernate

ftrace_stop() and ftrace_start() were added to the suspend and hibernate
process because there was some function within the work flow that caused
the system to reboot if it was traced. This function has recently been
found (restore_processor_state()). Now there's no reason to disable
function tracing while we are going into suspend or hibernate, which means
that being able to trace this will help tremendously in debugging any
issues with suspend or hibernate.

This also means that the ftrace_stop/start() functions can be removed
and simplify the function tracing code a bit.
