HID: i2c-hid: call the hid driver's suspend and resume callbacks

Currently, the i2c-hid driver does not call the suspend, resume, and
reset_resume callbacks in the hid_driver struct when those events occur.
This means that HID drivers for i2c-hid devices will not be able to execute
commands which may be needed during suspend or resume. One example is when a
touchpad using the hid-multitouch driver gets reset by i2c-hid coming out of
resume. Since the reset_resume callback never gets called the device is never
put back into the correct input mode. This patch calls the suspend and resume
callbacks and tries to duplicate the functionality of the usb-hid driver.
