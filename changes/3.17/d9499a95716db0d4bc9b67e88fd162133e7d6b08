NFSD: Decrease nfsd_users in nfsd_startup_generic fail

A memory allocation failure could cause nfsd_startup_generic to fail, in
which case nfsd_users wouldn't be incorrectly left elevated.

After nfsd restarts nfsd_startup_generic will then succeed without doing
anything--the first consequence is likely nfs4_start_net finding a bad
laundry_wq and crashing.
