ASoC: rt5677: Convert to use rl6231_pll_calc

The implementation of rt5677_pll_calc() has the same logic of rl6231_pll_calc().
The only difference is the lower boundary checking for freq_in.

This patch calls rl6231_pll_calc() instead of open-coded.
The k_bp of struct rt5677_pll_code is always false, thus also remove the
code to check pll_code.k_bp.
