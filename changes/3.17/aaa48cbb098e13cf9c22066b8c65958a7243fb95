[media] v4l: vsp1: Fix routing cleanup when stopping the stream

Commit d9b45ed3d8b75e8cf38c8cd1563c29217eecba27 ("v4l: vsp1: Support
multi-input entities") reworked pipeline routing configuration and
introduced a bug by writing to the entities routing registers without
first checking whether the entity had a routing register. This results
in overwriting the value at offset 0 of the device register space when
stopping the stream.

Fix this by skipping routing register write for entities without a
routing register.
