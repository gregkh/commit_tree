md/raid10: fix memory leak when reshaping a RAID10.

raid10 reshape clears unwanted bits from a bio->bi_flags using
a method which, while clumsy, worked until 3.10 when BIO_OWNS_VEC
was added.
Since then it clears that bit but shouldn't.  This results in a
memory leak.

So change to used the approved method of clearing unwanted bits.

As this causes a memory leak which can consume all of memory
the fix is suitable for -stable.
