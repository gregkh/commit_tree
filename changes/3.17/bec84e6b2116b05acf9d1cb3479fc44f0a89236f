be2net: create optimal number of queues on SR-IOV config

If SR-IOV is enabled in the adapter, the FW distributes queue resources
evenly across the PF and it's VFs. If the user is not interested in enabling
VFs, the queues set aside for VFs are wasted.
This patch adds support for the PF driver to re-configure the resource
distribution in FW based on the number of VFs enabled by the user.
This also allows for supporting RSS queues on VFs, when less number of VFs
are enabled per PF. When maximum number of VFs are enabled, each VF typically
gets only one RXQ.
