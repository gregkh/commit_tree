nohz: Support nohz full remote kick

Remotely kicking a full nohz CPU in order to make it re-evaluate its
next tick is currently implemented using the scheduler IPI.

However this bloats a scheduler fast path with an off-topic feature.
The scheduler tick was abused here for its cool "callable
anywhere/anytime" properties.

But now that the irq work subsystem can queue remote callbacks, it's
a perfect fit to safely queue IPIs when interrupts are disabled
without worrying about concurrent callers.

So lets implement remote kick on top of irq work. This is going to
be used when a new event requires the next tick to be recalculated:
more than 1 task competing on the CPU, timer armed, ...
