staging: comedi: amplc_dio200: use the comedi_device 'mmio' member

The amplc_dio200_common module currently uses a union in the private
data to determine if the hardware uses port or memory mapped I/O.

Use the new 'mmio' member in the comedi_device for the ioremap'ed
base address and remove all the union code.
