spi: sh-msiof: Fix leaking of unused DMA descriptors

If dmaengine_prep_slave_sg() or dmaengine_submit() fail, we may leak
unused DMA descriptors.

As per Documentation/dmaengine.txt, once a DMA descriptor has been
obtained, it must be submitted. Hence:
  - First prepare and submit all DMA descriptors,
  - Prepare the SPI controller for DMA,
  - Start DMA by calling dma_async_issue_pending(),
  - Make sure to call dmaengine_terminate_all() on all descriptors that
    haven't completed.
