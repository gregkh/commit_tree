drm/nouveau/fifo: allow direct access to channel control registers where possible

The indirect method has been left in-place here as a fallback path, as
it may not be possible to map the non-PAGE_SIZE aligned control areas
across some chipset+interface combinations.

This isn't a problem for the primary use-case where the core and drm
are linked together in kernel-land, but across a VM or (in the case
where it applies now) between the core in the kernel and a userspace
test tool.
