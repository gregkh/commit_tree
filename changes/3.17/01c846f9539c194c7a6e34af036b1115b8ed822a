Input: wacom - compute the HID report size to get the actual packet size

This removes an USB dependency and is more accurate: the computed pktlen
is the actual maximum size of the reports forwarded by the device.

Given that the pktlen is correctly computed/validated, we can store it now
in the features struct instead of having a special handling in the rest of
the code.

Likewise, this information is not mandatory anymore in the description
of devices in wacom_wac.c. They will be removed in a separate patch.
