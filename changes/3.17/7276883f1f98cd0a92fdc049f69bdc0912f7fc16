misc/GenWQE: fix pci_enable_msi usage

GenWQE used to call pci_enable_msi_block to allocate a desired number
of MSI's. If that was not possible pci_enable_msi_block returned with a
smaller number which might be possible to allocate. GenWQE then called
pci_enable_msi_block with that number.

Since commit a30d0108b
"GenWQE: Use pci_enable_msi_exact() instead of pci_enable_msi_block()"
pci_enable_msi_exact is used which fails if the desired number of MSI's
was not possible to allocate. Change GenWQE to use pci_enable_msi_range
to restore the old behavior.
