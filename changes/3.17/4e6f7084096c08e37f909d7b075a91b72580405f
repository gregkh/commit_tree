arm64: topology: add MPIDR-based detection

Create cpu topology based on MPIDR. When hardware sets MPIDR to sane
values, this method will always work. Therefore it should also work well
as the fallback method. [1]

When we have multiple processing elements in the system, we create
the cpu topology by mapping each affinity level (from lowest to highest)
to threads (if they exist), cores, and clusters.
