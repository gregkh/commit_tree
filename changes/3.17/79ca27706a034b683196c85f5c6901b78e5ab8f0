drm/nouveau/core: rework event interface

This is a lot of prep-work for being able to send event notifications
back to userspace.  Events now contain data, rather than a "something
just happened" signal.

Handler data is now embedded into a containing structure, rather than
being kmalloc()'d, and can optionally have the notify routine handled
in a workqueue.

Various races between suspend/unload with display HPD/DP IRQ handlers
automagically solved as a result.
