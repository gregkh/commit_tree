KVM: x86: DR6/7.RTM cannot be written

Haswell and newer Intel CPUs have support for RTM, and in that case DR6.RTM is
not fixed to 1 and DR7.RTM is not fixed to zero. That is not the case in the
current KVM implementation. This bug is apparent only if the MOV-DR instruction
is emulated or the host also debugs the guest.

This patch is a partial fix which enables DR6.RTM and DR7.RTM to be cleared and
set respectively. It also sets DR6.RTM upon every debug exception. Obviously,
it is not a complete fix, as debugging of RTM is still unsupported.
