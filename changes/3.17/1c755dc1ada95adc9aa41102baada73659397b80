nfsd: Add locking to protect the state owner lists

Change to using the clp->cl_lock for this. For now, there's a lot of
cl_lock thrashing, but in later patches we'll eliminate that and close
the potential races that can occur when releasing the cl_lock while
walking the lists. For now, the client_mutex prevents those races.
