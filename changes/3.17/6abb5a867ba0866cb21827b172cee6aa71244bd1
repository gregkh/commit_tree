mm: memcontrol: avoid charge statistics churn during page migration

Charge migration currently disables IRQs twice to update the charge
statistics for the old page and then again for the new page.

But migration is a seamless transition of a charge from one physical
page to another one of the same size, so this should be a non-event from
an accounting point of view.  Leave the statistics alone.
