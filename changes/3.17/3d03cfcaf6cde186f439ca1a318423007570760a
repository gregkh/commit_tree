staging: comedi: drivers: remove unnecessary DRIVER_NAME defines

These defines are usually only used to initialize the driver_name
member of the comedi_driver struct. Some of the drivers also use
the define as part of dev_{level}() messages and/or when doing a
request_irq().

The addition of the DRIVER_NAME to the messages is just added noise
and the dev->board_name is typically used in the request_irq().

Just remove all the DRIVER_NAME defines.
