timerfd: Implement show_fdinfo method

For checkpoint/restore of timerfd files we need to know how exactly
the timer were armed, to be able to recreate it on restore stage.
Thus implement show_fdinfo method which provides enough information
for that.

One of significant changes I think is the addition of @settime_flags
member. Currently there are two flags TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME and
TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET, and the second can be found from
@might_cancel variable but in case if the flags will be extended
in future we most probably will have to somehow remember them
explicitly anyway so I guss doing that right now won't hurt.

To not bloat the timerfd_ctx structure I've converted @expired
to short integer and defined @settime_flags as short too.

v2 (by avagin@, vdavydov@ and tglx@):

 - Add it_value/it_interval fields
 - Save flags being used in timerfd_setup in context

v3 (by tglx@):
 - don't forget to use CONFIG_PROC_FS

v4 (by akpm@):
 -Use define timerfd_show NULL for non c/r config
