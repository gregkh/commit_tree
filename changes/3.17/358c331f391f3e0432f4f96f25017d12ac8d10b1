rtmutex: Simplify and document try_to_take_rtmutex()

The current implementation of try_to_take_rtmutex() is correct, but
requires more than a single brain twist to understand the clever
encoded conditionals.

Untangle it and document the cases proper.

Looks less efficient at the first glance, but actually reduces the
binary code size on x8664 by 80 bytes.
