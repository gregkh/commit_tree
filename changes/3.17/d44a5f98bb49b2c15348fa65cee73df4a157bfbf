ufs: query descriptor API

Introduces the API for sending queries with descriptors.
A descriptor is a block or page of parameters that describe the device.
The descriptors are classified into types and can range in size
from 2 bytes through 255 bytes.
All descriptors have a length value as their first element, and a type
identification element as their second byte.
All descriptors are readable and some may be write once.
They are accessed using their type, index and selector.
