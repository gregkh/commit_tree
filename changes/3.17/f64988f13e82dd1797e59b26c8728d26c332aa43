MIPS: OCTEON: watchdog: don't jump to bootloader without entry address

If CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is set, the driver thinks bootloader entry
address is configured and we should jump there. However, this is
not necessarily true if the kernel is booted on a system
with older/incompatible bootloader.

Add dynamic checks for the bootloader entry address.
