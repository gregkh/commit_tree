mm, thp: only collapse hugepages to nodes with affinity for zone_reclaim_mode

Commit 9f1b868a13ac ("mm: thp: khugepaged: add policy for finding target
node") improved the previous khugepaged logic which allocated a
transparent hugepages from the node of the first page being collapsed.

However, it is still possible to collapse pages to remote memory which
may suffer from additional access latency.  With the current policy, it
is possible that 255 pages (with PAGE_SHIFT == 12) will be collapsed
remotely if the majority are allocated from that node.

When zone_reclaim_mode is enabled, it means the VM should make every
attempt to allocate locally to prevent NUMA performance degradation.  In
this case, we do not want to collapse hugepages to remote nodes that
would suffer from increased access latency.  Thus, when
zone_reclaim_mode is enabled, only allow collapsing to nodes with
RECLAIM_DISTANCE or less.

There is no functional change for systems that disable
zone_reclaim_mode.
