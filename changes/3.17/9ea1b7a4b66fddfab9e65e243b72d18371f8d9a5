[media] v4l2-ctrls: compare values only once

When setting a control the control's new value is compared to the current
value twice: once by new_to_cur(), once by cluster_changed(). Not a big
deal when dealing with simple values, but it can be a problem when dealing
with compound types or arrays. So fix this: cluster_changed() sets the
has_changed flag, which is used by new_to_cur() instead of having to do
another compare.
