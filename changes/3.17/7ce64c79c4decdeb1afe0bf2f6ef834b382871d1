net: fix creation adjacent device symlinks

__netdev_adjacent_dev_insert may add adjust device of different net
namespace, without proper check it leads to emergence of broken
sysfs links from/to devices in another namespace.
Fix: rewrite netdev_adjacent_is_neigh_list macro as a function,
     move net_eq check into netdev_adjacent_is_neigh_list.
     (thanks David)
