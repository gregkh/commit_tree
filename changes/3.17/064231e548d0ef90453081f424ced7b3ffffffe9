MIPS: pm-cps: Prevent use of mips_cps_* without CPS SMP

These symbols will not be defined when CONFIG_MIPS_CPS=n, but although
the CPS_PM_POWER_GATED state will never be used in that case the
compiler doesn't have enough information to figure that out. Add checks
which evaluate to a constant false for CONFIG_MIPS_CPS=n cases in order
to help the compiler out & eliminate the symbol references.
