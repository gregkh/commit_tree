ASoC: rsnd: SSI + DMA can select BUSIF

Sound data needs to be sent to R-Car sound SSI when playback.
But, there are 2 interfaces for it.
1st is SSITDR/SSIRDR which are mapped on SSI.
2nd is SSIn_BUSIF which are mapped on SSIU.

2nd SSIn_BUSIF is used when DMA transfer,
and it is always used if sound data came from via SRC.
But, we can use it when SSI+DMA case too.
(Current driver is assuming 1st SSITDR/SSIRDR for it)

2nd SSIn_BUSIF can be used as FIFO.
This is very helpful/useful for SSI+DMA.

But DMA address / DMA ID are not same between 1st/2nd cases.
This patch care about these settings.
