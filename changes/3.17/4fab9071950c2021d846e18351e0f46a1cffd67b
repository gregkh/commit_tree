tcp: fix tcp_release_cb() to dispatch via address family for mtu_reduced()

Make sure we use the correct address-family-specific function for
handling MTU reductions from within tcp_release_cb().

Previously AF_INET6 sockets were incorrectly always using the IPv6
code path when sometimes they were handling IPv4 traffic and thus had
an IPv4 dst.
