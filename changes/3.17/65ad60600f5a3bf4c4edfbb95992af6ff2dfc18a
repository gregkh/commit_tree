dmaengine: pl330: Change type pl330_chid from void * to struct pl330_thread *

The pl330_chid field of the dma_pl330_chan struct always holds a pointer to the
thread that is associated with the channel. Changing its type form void * to
struct pl330_thread makes things more type safe and removes the need for
unnecessary typecasts. While we are at it also rename the field from the cryptic
pl330_chid to thread.
