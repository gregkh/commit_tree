kexec: implementation of new syscall kexec_file_load

Previous patch provided the interface definition and this patch prvides
implementation of new syscall.

Previously segment list was prepared in user space.  Now user space just
passes kernel fd, initrd fd and command line and kernel will create a
segment list internally.

This patch contains generic part of the code.  Actual segment preparation
and loading is done by arch and image specific loader.  Which comes in
next patch.
