i2c: stub: Add support for banked register ranges

Some chips implement banked register ranges. This allows implementing
more registers than the limited 8-bit address space originally allows.
In order to access a register on these chips, you must first select
the proper bank. Add support for this mechanism to the i2c-stub driver
so that such chips can be emulated. All the bank settings are passed
as module parameters.
