nfsd: ensure atomicity in nfsd4_free_stateid and nfsd4_validate_stateid

Hold the cl_lock over the bulk of these functions. In addition to
ensuring that they aren't freed prematurely, this will also help prevent
a potential race that could be introduced later. Once we remove the
client_mutex, it'll be possible for FREE_STATEID and CLOSE to race and
for both to try to put the "persistent" reference to the stateid.
