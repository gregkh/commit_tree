x86/debug: Drop several unnecessary CFI annotations

With the conversion of the register saving code from macros to
functions, and with those functions not clobbering most of the
registers they spill, there's no need to annotate most of the
spill operations; the only exceptions being %rbx (always
modified) and %rcx (modified on the error_kernelspace: path).

Also remove a bogus commented out annotation - there's no
register %orig_rax after all.
