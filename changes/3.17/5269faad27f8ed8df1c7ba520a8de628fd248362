ktest: Some cleanup for improving readability

Some cleanup for improving readability as follows.

  - Initialize $ktest_config at its definition.
  - Put parentheses around the `config-file' argument in the usage message
    because it's a optional one.
  - Rename get_ktest_config{,s} to more descriptive get_mandatory_config{,s}.
