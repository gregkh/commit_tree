mm, oom: rename zonelist locking functions

try_set_zonelist_oom() and clear_zonelist_oom() are not named properly
to imply that they require locking semantics to avoid out_of_memory()
being reordered.

zone_scan_lock is required for both functions to ensure that there is
proper locking synchronization.

Rename try_set_zonelist_oom() to oom_zonelist_trylock() and rename
clear_zonelist_oom() to oom_zonelist_unlock() to imply there is proper
locking semantics.

At the same time, convert oom_zonelist_trylock() to return bool instead
of int since only success and failure are tested.
