irqchip: or1k-pic: Migrate from arch/openrisc/

In addition to consolidating the or1k-pic with other interrupt
controllers, this makes OpenRISC less tied to its on-cpu
interrupt controller.

All or1k-pic specific parts are moved out of irq.c and into
drivers/irqchip/irq-or1k-pic.c

In that transition, the functionality have been divided into
three chip variants.
One that handles level triggered interrupts, one that handles edge
triggered interrupts and one that handles the interrupt
controller that is present in the or1200 OpenRISC cpu
implementation.
