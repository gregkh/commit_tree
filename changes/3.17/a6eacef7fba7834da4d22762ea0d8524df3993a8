tipc: bump max configurable window size

The maximum window size is limited by the sequence gap field, which
was expanded with bd7845337b105e090dd18912d511139945fa7586
("tipc: Expand link sequence gap field to 13 bits")
We remove the artificial limit that prevents the link window to be
set larger than 150.
