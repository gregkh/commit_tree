arm64: add newline to I-cache policy string

Due to a missing newline in the I-cache policy detection log output,
it's possible to get some ratehr unfortunate output at boot time:

CPU1: Booted secondary processor
Detected VIPT I-cache on CPU1CPU2: Booted secondary processor
Detected VIPT I-cache on CPU2CPU3: Booted secondary processor
Detected VIPT I-cache on CPU3CPU4: Booted secondary processor
Detected PIPT I-cache on CPU4CPU5: Booted secondary processor
Detected PIPT I-cache on CPU5Brought up 6 CPUs
SMP: Total of 6 processors activated.

This patch adds the missing newline to the format string, cleaning up
the output.
