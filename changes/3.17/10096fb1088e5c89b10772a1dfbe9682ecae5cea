Export sync_filesystem() for modular ->remount_fs() use

This patch changes sync_filesystem() to be EXPORT_SYMBOL().

The reason this is needed is that starting with 3.15 kernel, due to
Theodore Ts'o's commit 02b9984d6408 ("fs: push sync_filesystem() down to
the file system's remount_fs()"), all file systems that have dirty data
to be written out need to call sync_filesystem() from their
->remount_fs() method when remounting read-only.

As this is now a generically required function rather than an internal
only function it should be EXPORT_SYMBOL() so that all file systems can
call it.
