spi/rockchip: Fix the wait_for_idle() timeout

The wait_for_idle() could get unlucky and timeout too quickly.
Specifically, the old calculation was effectively:
  timeout = jiffies + 1;
  if (jiffies >= timeout) print warning;

From the above it should be obvious that if jiffies ticks in just the
wrong place then we'll have an effective timeout of 0.

Fix this by effectively changing the above ">=" to a ">".  That gives
us an extra jiffy to finish.
