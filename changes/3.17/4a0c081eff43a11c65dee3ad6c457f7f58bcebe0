net: bcmgenet: call bcmgenet_dma_teardown in bcmgenet_fini_dma

We should not be manipulaging the DMA_CTRL registers directly by writing
0 to them to disable DMA. This is an operation that needs to be timed to
make sure the DMA engines have been properly stopped since their state
machine stops on a packet boundary, not immediately.

Make sure that tha bcmgenet_fini_dma() calls bcmgenet_dma_teardown() to
ensure a proper DMA engine state. As a result, we need to reorder the
function bodies to resolve the use dependency.
