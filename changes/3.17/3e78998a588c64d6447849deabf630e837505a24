drm/i915/bdw: implement semaphore signal

Semaphore signalling works similarly to previous GENs with the exception
that the per ring mailboxes no longer exist. Instead you must define
your own space, somewhere in the GTT.

The comments in the code define the layout I've opted for, which should
be fairly future proof. Ie. I tried to define offsets in abstract terms
(NUM_RINGS, seqno size, etc).

NOTE: If one wanted to move this to the HWSP they could. I've decided
one 4k object would be easier to deal with, and provide potential wins
with cache locality, but that's all speculative.

v2: Update the macro to not need the other ring's ring->id (Chris)
Update the comment to use the correct formula (Chris)

v3: Move the macros the ringbuffer.h to prevent churn in next patch
(Ville)

v4: Fixed compilation rebase conflict
