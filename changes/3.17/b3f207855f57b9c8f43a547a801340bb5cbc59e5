perf: Handle compat ioctl

When running a 32-bit userspace on a 64-bit kernel (eg. i386
application on x86_64 kernel or 32-bit arm userspace on arm64
kernel) some of the perf ioctls must be treated with special
care, as they have a pointer size encoded in the command.

For example, PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID in 32-bit world will be encoded
as 0x80042407, but 64-bit kernel will expect 0x80082407. In
result the ioctl will fail returning -ENOTTY.

This patch solves the problem by adding code fixing up the
size as compat_ioctl file operation.
