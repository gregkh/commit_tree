Revert "USB: option,zte_ev: move most ZTE CDMA devices to zte_ev"

This reverts commit 73228a0538a7 ("USB: option,zte_ev: move most ZTE
CDMA devices to zte_ev").

Move the IDs of the devices that were previously driven by the option
driver back to that driver.

As several users have reported, the zte_ev driver is causing random
disconnects as well as reconnect failures.

A closer analysis of the zte_ev setup code reveals that it consists of
standard CDC requests (SET/GET_LINE_CODING and SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE)
but unfortunately fails to get some of those right. In particular, as
reported by Liu Lei, it fails to lower DTR/RTS on close. It also appears
that the control requests lack the interface argument.

Note that the zte_ev driver is based on code (once) distributed by ZTE
that still appears to originally have been reverse-engineered and bolted
onto the generic driver.

Since line control is already handled properly by the option driver, and
the SET/GET_LINE_CODING requests appears to be redundant (amounts to a
SET 9600 8N1), this is a first step in ultimately removing the redundant
zte_ev driver.

Note that AC2726 had already been moved back to option, and that some
IDs were in the device table of both drivers prior to the commit being
reverted.
