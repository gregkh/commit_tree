autofs4: remove a redundant assignment

The variable 'ino' already exists and already has the correct value.
The d_fsdata of a dentry is never changed after the d_fsdata is
instantiated, so this new assignment cannot be necessary.

It was introduced in commit b5b801779d59 ("autofs4: Add d_manage()
dentry operation").
