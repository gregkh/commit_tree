bnx2x: Fail probe of VFs using an old incompatible driver

There are linux distributions where the inbox bnx2x driver contains SRIOV
support but doesn't contain the changes introduced in b9871bcf
"bnx2x: VF RSS support - PF side".

A VF in a VM running that distribution over a new hypervisor will access
incorrect addresses when trying to transmit packets, causing an attention
in the hypervisor and making that VF inactive until FLRed.

The driver in the VM has to ne upgraded [no real way to overcome this], but
due to the HW attention currently arising upgrading the driver in the VM
would not suffice [since the VF needs also be FLRed if the previous driver
was already loaded].

This patch causes the PF to fail the acquire message from a VF running an
old problematic driver; The VF will then gracefully fail it's probe preventing
the HW attention [and allow clean upgrade of driver in VM].
