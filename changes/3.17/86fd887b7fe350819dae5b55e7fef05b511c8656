vgaarb: Don't default exclusively to first video device with mem+io

Commit 20cde694027e ("x86, ia64: Move EFI_FB vga_default_device()
initialization to pci_vga_fixup()") moved boot video device detection from
efifb to x86 and ia64 pci/fixup.c.

For dual-GPU Apple computers above change represents a regression as code
in efifb did forcefully override vga_default_device while the merge did not
(vgaarb happens prior to PCI fixup).

To improve on initial device selection by vgaarb (it cannot know if PCI
device not behind bridges see/decode legacy VGA I/O or not), move the
screen_info based check from pci_video_fixup() to vgaarb's init function and
use it to refine/override decision taken while adding the individual PCI
VGA devices.  This way PCI fixup has no reason to adjust vga_default_device
anymore but can depend on its value for flagging shadowed VBIOS.

This has the nice benefit of removing duplicated code but does introduce a
#if defined() block in vgaarb.  Not all architectures have screen_info and
would cause compile to fail without it.
