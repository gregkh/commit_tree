x86/efi: Use early_memunmap() to squelch sparse errors

The kbuild reports the following sparse errors,

>> arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:242:23: sparse: incorrect type in >> argument 1 (different address spaces)
   arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:242:23:    expected void [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
   arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:242:23:    got void *[assigned] tablep
>> arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:245:23: sparse: incorrect type in >> argument 1 (different address spaces)
   arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:245:23:    expected void [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
   arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:245:23:    got struct efi_setup_data *[assigned] data

Dave Young had made previous attempts to convert the early_iounmap()
calls to early_memunmap() but ran into merge conflicts with commit
9e5c33d7aeee ("mm: create generic early_ioremap() support").

Now that we've got that commit in place we can switch to using
early_memunmap() since we're already using early_memremap() in
efi_reuse_config().
