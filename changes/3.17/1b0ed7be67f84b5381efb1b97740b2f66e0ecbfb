[media] coda: allow odd width, but still round up bytesperline

Even though the CODA h.264 decoder always decodes complete macroblocks, we can
set the stride to the corresponding multiple of 16 and use a value smaller than
that as real width. Unfortunately the same doesn't work for height, as there
is no vertical linesperframe stride for discontiguous planar YUV frames.
