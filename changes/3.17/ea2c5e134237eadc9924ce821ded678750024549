xen-netback: move NAPI add/remove calls

Originally netif_napi_add was in xenvif_init_queue and netif_napi_del
was in xenvif_deinit_queue, while kthreads were handled in
xenvif_connect and xenvif_disconnect. Move netif_napi_add and
netif_napi_del to xenvif_connect and xenvif_disconnect so that they
reside together with kthread operations.
