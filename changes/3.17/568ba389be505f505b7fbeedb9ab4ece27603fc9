brcmfmac: Fix OOB interrupt not working for BCM43362

It has taken me a long long time to get the OOB interrupt working on the
AP6210 sdio wifi/bt module found on various Allwinner A20 boards. In the
end I found these magic register pokes in the cubietruck kernel tree:

This is also done for the bcm43362 in broadcom's internal/proprietary driver.
