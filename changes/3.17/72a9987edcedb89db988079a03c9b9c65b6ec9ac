drm/radeon: Always flush the HDP cache before submitting a CS to the GPU

This ensures the GPU sees all previous CPU writes to VRAM, which makes it
safe:

* For userspace to stream data from CPU to GPU via VRAM instead of GTT
* For IBs to be stored in VRAM instead of GTT
* For ring buffers to be stored in VRAM instead of GTT, if the HPD flush
  is performed via MMIO
