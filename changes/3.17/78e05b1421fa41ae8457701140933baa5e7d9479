powerpc: Add smp_mb()s to arch_spin_unlock_wait()

Similar to the previous commit which described why we need to add a
barrier to arch_spin_is_locked(), we have a similar problem with
spin_unlock_wait().

We need a barrier on entry to ensure any spinlock we have previously
taken is visibly locked prior to the load of lock->slock.

It's also not clear if spin_unlock_wait() is intended to have ACQUIRE
semantics. For now be conservative and add a barrier on exit to give it
ACQUIRE semantics.
