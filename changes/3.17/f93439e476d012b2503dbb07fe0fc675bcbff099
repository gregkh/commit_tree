RDMA/ocrdma: Do not skip setting deferred_arm

When ib_request_notify_cq() is called for the first time, ocrdma tries
to skip setting deffered_arm flag. This may lead CQ to an un-armed
state thus never generating a CQ event and leaving consumer hung.

This patch removes the part of code that skips setting deferred_arm.
