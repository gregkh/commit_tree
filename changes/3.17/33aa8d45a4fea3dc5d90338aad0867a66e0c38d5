staging: emxx_udc: Add Emma Mobile USB Gadget driver

Add the emxx_udc driver to staging based on an old linux-2.6.35.7
android tree. The driver has been brushed up slightly to complile
but it is still in great need of cleanup.

At this point DT bindings are clearly lacking and I doubt that the
driver even can run with multiple instances (global variables, hurray!).
