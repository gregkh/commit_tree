mmc: sh_mmcif: Fix DMA slave address configuration

Commit e5a233cb647d749de2f188477c9a54b94d90477f ("mmc: sh_mmcif:
Factorize DMA channel request and configuration code") incorrectly
set the destination address for both slave channels instead of setting
the source address for the receive channel. Fix that.
