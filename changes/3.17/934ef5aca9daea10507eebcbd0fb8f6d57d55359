USB: serial: cp210x: Removing unncessary `usb_reset_device` on startup

This `usb_reset_device` command has been around since the driver was
originally reverse engineered. It doesn't cause much issue on single
interface CP210x devices, but on the CP2105 and CP2108 with 2 and 4
interfaces respectively it will cause instability on enumeration and
delays enumeration noticably. There should be no reason to reset a device
at startup, per the CP210x AN571 spec.
