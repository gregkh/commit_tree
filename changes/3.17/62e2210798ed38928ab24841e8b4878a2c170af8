kbuild: drop shared library support from Makefile.host

The shared library feature in Makefile.host is no longer used.
Rip it off to keep the build infrastucture simple.

Update Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt too.
The section "4.3 Definition shared libraries" should be removed
and the following sections should be re-numbered.
