drm/exynos: fimd: support LCD I80 interface

To support MIPI command mode based I80 interface panel,
FIMD should do followings:
- Sets LCD I80 interface timings configuration.
- Uses "lcd_sys" as an IRQ resource and sets relevant IRQ configuration.
- Sets LCD block configuration for I80 interface.
- Sets ideal(pixel) clock is 2 times faster than the original one
  to generate frame done IRQ prior to the next TE signal.
- Implements trigger feature that transfers image data if there is page
  flip request, and implements TE handler to call trigger function.
