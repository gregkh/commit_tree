tools lib traceevent: Clean up format of args in jbd2 plugin

While synchronizing what's in trace-cmd vs what's in perf, I came
across a change that was made when entering the jbd2 plugin into
the tools/lib/traceevent directory. For example, one of the function
prototypes went from:

unsigned long long process_jbd2_dev_to_name(struct trace_seq *s,
					    unsigned long long *args)

to:

static unsigned long long
process_jbd2_dev_to_name(struct trace_seq *s,
			 unsigned long long *args)

I can understand the line break after the long long, but there's no
reason to keep args on a separate line.
