crypto: caam - Correct definition of registers in memory map

Some registers like SECVID, CHAVID, CHA Revision Number,
CTPR were defined as 64 bit resgisters.  The IP provides
a DWT bit(Double word Transpose) to transpose the two words when
a double word register is accessed. However setting this bit
would also affect the operation of job descriptors as well as
other registers which are truly double word in nature.
So, for the IP to work correctly on big-endian as well as
little-endian SoC's, change is required to access all 32 bit
registers as 32 bit quantities.
