defxx: Handle DMA mapping errors

This adds error handling for DMA mapping requests; I think there isn't
much else to say about it.

A good side-effect is the mapping in the transmit path is now made with
the board lock released.  Also if DMA mapping fails for a newly
allocated receive buffer, then data from the old buffer will be copied
out (as is presently done for small frames only whose size does not
exceed SKBUFF_RX_COPYBREAK) and the original buffer returned, with its
mapping unchanged, to the DMA descriptor ring.
