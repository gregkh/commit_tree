ALSA: pcm_dmaengine: Correct support for 24bits physical sample widths

In case of _3LE/_3BE formats the samples are stored in 3 consecutive bytes
without padding it to 4 bytes. This means that the DMA needs to be able to
support 3 bytes word length in order to read/write the samples from memory
correctly. Originally the code treated 24 bits physical length samples as
they were 32 bits which leads to corruption when playing or recording audio.

The hw.formats field has already been prepared to exclude formats not
supported by the DMA engine in use, which means that only on platforms where
3 bytes is supported by the DMA will be able to use this format.
