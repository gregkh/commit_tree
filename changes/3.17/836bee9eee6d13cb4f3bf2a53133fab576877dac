Staging: unisys: remove references to __DATE__ and __TIME__

The use of __DATE__ and __TIME__ is no longer allowed in the kernel so this
commit removes those.  They were once useful when the drivers were being
built externally, but now that the drivers are in the kernel the use of the
macros is redundant since the kernel already has the same information
elsewhere.

In addition, using these macros breaks the build if using gcc 4.9.0
