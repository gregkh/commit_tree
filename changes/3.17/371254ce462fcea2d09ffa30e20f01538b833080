usb: musb: dsps: Add the sw_babble_control() and Enable for newer silicon

Add sw_babble_control() logic to differentiate between transient
babble and real babble condition. Also add the SW babble control
register definitions.

Babble control register logic is implemented in the latest
revision of AM335x.

Find whether we are running on newer silicon. The babble control
register reads 0x4 by default in newer silicon as opposed to 0
in old versions of AM335x. Based on this enable the sw babble
control logic.
