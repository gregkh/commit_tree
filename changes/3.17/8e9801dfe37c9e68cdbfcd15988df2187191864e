ocfs2: o2net: set tcp user timeout to max value

When tcp retransmit timeout(15mins), the connection will be closed.
Pending messages may be lost during this time.  So we set tcp user
timeout to override the retransmit timeout to the max value.  This is OK
for ocfs2 since we have disk heartbeat, if peer crash, the disk
heartbeat will timeout and it will be evicted, if disk heartbeat not
timeout and connection idle for a long time, then this means the cluster
enters split-brain state, since fence can't happen, we'd better keep the
connection and wait network recover.
