xfs: squash prealloc while over quota free space as well

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

Commit 4d559a3b introduced heavy prealloc. squashing to catch the case
of requesting too large a prealloc on smaller filesystems, leading to
repeated flush and retry cycles that occur on ENOSPC. Now that we issue
eofblocks scans on EDQUOT/ENOSPC, squash the prealloc against the
minimum available free space across all applicable quotas as well to
avoid a similar problem of repeated eofblocks scans.
