serial: samsung: get fifosize via device tree

UART modules on some SoCs only differ in the fifosize of each
UART channel. Its useless to duplicate the drv_data structure
or create a compatible name for such a change.

We can get fifosize via the device tree nodes (not mandating it).

Also updates the documentation.
