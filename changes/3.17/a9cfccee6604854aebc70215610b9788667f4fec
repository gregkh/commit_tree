x86, build: Change code16gcc.h from a C header to an assembly header

By changing code16gcc.h from a C header to an assembly header and use
the -Wa,... option to gcc to force it to be added to the assembly
input, we can avoid the problems with gcc reordering code bits on us.

If we have -m16, we still use it, of course.
