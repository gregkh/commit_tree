ftrace-graph: Remove dependency of ftrace_stop() from ftrace_graph_stop()

ftrace_stop() is going away as it disables parts of function tracing
that affects users that should not be affected. But ftrace_graph_stop()
is built on ftrace_stop(). Here's another example of killing all of
function tracing because something went wrong with function graph
tracing.

Instead of disabling all users of function tracing on function graph
error, disable only function graph tracing.

A new function is created called ftrace_graph_is_dead(). This is called
in strategic paths to prevent function graph from doing more harm and
allowing at least a warning to be printed before the system crashes.

NOTE: ftrace_stop() is still used until all the archs are converted over
to use ftrace_graph_is_dead(). After that, ftrace_stop() will be removed.
