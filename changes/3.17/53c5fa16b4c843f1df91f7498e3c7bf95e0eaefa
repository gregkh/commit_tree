nohz: Switch to nohz full remote kick on timer enqueue

When a new timer is enqueued on a full dynticks target, that CPU must
re-evaluate the next tick to handle the timer correctly.

This is currently performed through the scheduler IPI. Meanwhile this
happens at the cost of off-topic workarounds in that fast path to make
it call irq_exit().

As we plan to remove this hack off the scheduler IPI, lets use
the nohz full kick instead. Pretty much any IPI fits for that job
as long at it calls irq_exit(). The nohz full kick just happens to be
handy and readily available here.

If it happens to be too much an overkill in the future, we can still
turn that timer kick into an empty IPI.
