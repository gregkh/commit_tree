seccomp: Replace BUG(!spin_is_locked()) with assert_spin_lock

Current upstream kernel hangs with mips and powerpc targets in
uniprocessor mode if SECCOMP is configured.

Bisect points to commit dbd952127d11 ("seccomp: introduce writer locking").
Turns out that code such as
	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&list_lock));
can not be used in uniprocessor mode because spin_is_locked() always
returns false in this configuration, and that assert_spin_locked()
exists for that very purpose and must be used instead.
