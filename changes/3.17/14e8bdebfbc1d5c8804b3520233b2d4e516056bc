ASoC: Add component level stream_event() and seq_notifier() support

This patch adds stream_event() and seq_notifier() callbacks similar to those
found in the snd_soc_codec_driver and snd_soc_platform driver struct to the
snd_soc_component_driver struct. This is meant to unify the handling of these
callbacks across different types of components and will eventually allow their
removal from the CODEC and platfrom driver structs.

The new callbacks are slightly different from the old ones in that they take a
snd_soc_component as a parameter rather than a snd_soc_dapm_context. This was
done since otherwise casting from the DAPM context to the component would
typically be the first thing to do in the callback. And the interface becomes
slightly cleaner by passing a snd_soc_component to all callbacks in the
snd_soc_component_driver struct.

The patch also already removes the stream_event() callback from the
snd_soc_codec_driver and snd_soc_platform_driver structs as it is currently
unused.
