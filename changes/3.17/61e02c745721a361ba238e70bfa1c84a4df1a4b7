mm: memcontrol: clean up reclaim size variable use in try_charge()

Charge reclaim and OOM currently use the charge batch variable, but
batching is already disabled at that point.  To simplify the charge
logic, the batch variable is reset to the original request size when
reclaim is entered, so it's functionally equal, but it's misleading.

Switch reclaim/OOM to nr_pages, which is the original request size.
