KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add H_SET_MODE hcall handling

This adds support for the H_SET_MODE hcall.  This hcall is a
multiplexer that has several functions, some of which are called
rarely, and some which are potentially called very frequently.
Here we add support for the functions that set the debug registers
CIABR (Completed Instruction Address Breakpoint Register) and
DAWR/DAWRX (Data Address Watchpoint Register and eXtension),
since they could be updated by the guest as often as every context
switch.

This also adds a kvmppc_power8_compatible() function to test to see
if a guest is compatible with POWER8 or not.  The CIABR and DAWR/X
only exist on POWER8.
