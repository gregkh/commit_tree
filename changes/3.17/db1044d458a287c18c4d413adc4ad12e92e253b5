RDMA/uapi: Include socket.h in rdma_user_cm.h

added struct sockaddr_storage to rdma_user_cm.h without also adding an
include for linux/socket.h to make sure it is defined.  Systemtap
needs the header files to build standalone and cannot rely on other
files to pre-include other headers, so add linux/socket.h to the list
of includes in this file.
