net-timestamp: move timestamp flags out of sk_flags

sk_flags is reaching its limit. New timestamping options will not fit.
Move all of them into a new field sk->sk_tsflags.

Added benefit is that this removes boilerplate code to convert between
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_.. and SOCK_TIMESTAMPING_.. in getsockopt/setsockopt.

SOCK_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE is also used to toggle the receive
timestamp logic (netstamp_needed). That can be simplified and this
last key removed, but will leave that for a separate patch.

The u16 in sock can be moved into a 16-bit hole below sk_gso_max_segs,
though that scatters tstamp fields throughout the struct.
