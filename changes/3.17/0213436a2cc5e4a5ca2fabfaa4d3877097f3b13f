scsi: do not issue SCSI RSOC command to Promise Vtrak E610f

Some devices don't like REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES and will
simply timeout causing sd_mod init to take a very very long time.
Introduce BLIST_NO_RSOC scsi scan flag, that stops RSOC from being
issued. Add it to Promise Vtrak E610f entry in scsi scan
blacklist. Fixes bug #79901 reported at
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79901

Fixes: 98dcc2946adb ("SCSI: sd: Update WRITE SAME heuristics")
