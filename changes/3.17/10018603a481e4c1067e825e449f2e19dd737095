drm/i915: preserve user forcewake over system suspend/resume

Atm, the forcewake refcount will be incorrectly set to zero during
system suspend if there is any reference held via the
i915_forcewake_user debugfs entry.

Fix this by simply not zeroing the sw counters during suspend and
restoring the original state using them. Note that the only other
places where we zeroed the counters were driver load and unload time,
where it was redundant anyway.
