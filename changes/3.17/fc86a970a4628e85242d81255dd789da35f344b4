i40evf: set flags before sending message

In some circumstances, the firmware could beat us to the punch, and the
reply from the PF would come back before we were able to properly modify
the aq_pending and aq_required flags. This would mess up the flags and
put the driver in an indeterminate state, much like Schr√∂dinger's cat.
However, unlike the cat, the driver is definitely dead.

To fix this, simply set the flags before sending the request to the AQ.
This way, it won't matter if the interrupt comes back too soon.
