iommu/amd: Don't set pasid_state->mm to NULL in unbind_pasid

With calling te mmu_notifier_register function we hold a
reference to the mm_struct that needs to be released in
mmu_notifier_unregister. This is true even if the notifier
was already unregistered from exit_mmap and the .release
call-back has already run.

So make sure we call mmu_notifier_unregister unconditionally
in amd_iommu_unbind_pasid.
