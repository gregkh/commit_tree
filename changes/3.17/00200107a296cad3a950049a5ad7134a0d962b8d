ASoC: Move card field form platform/codec to component

Both the snd_soc_codec and snd_soc_platform struct do have a pointer to the
parent card and both handle this pointer in mostly the same way. This patch
moves the card field to the component level which will allow further code
consolidation between platforms and CODECS.

Since there are only a handful of users of the snd_soc_codec struct's card field
(and none of the snd_soc_platform's) these are update in this patch as well,
which allows it to be removed from the snd_soc_codec struct.
