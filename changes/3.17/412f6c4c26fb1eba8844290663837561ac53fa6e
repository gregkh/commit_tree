NFSv4: Don't clear the open state when we just did an OPEN_DOWNGRADE

If we did an OPEN_DOWNGRADE, then the right thing to do on success, is
to apply the new open mode to the struct nfs4_state. Instead, we were
unconditionally clearing the state, making it appear to our state
machinery as if we had just performed a CLOSE.
