ufs: fix deadlocks introduced by sb mutex merge

Commit 0244756edc4b ("ufs: sb mutex merge + mutex_destroy") introduces
deadlocks in ufs_new_inode() and ufs_free_inode().
Most callers of that functions acqure the mutex by themselves and
ufs_{new,free}_inode() do that via lock_ufs(),
i.e we have an unavoidable double lock.

The patch proposes to resolve the issue by making sure that
ufs_{new,free}_inode() are not called with the mutex held.
