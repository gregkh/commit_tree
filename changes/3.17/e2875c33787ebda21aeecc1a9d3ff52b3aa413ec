uas: Limit qdepth to 32 when connected over usb-2

Some jmicron uas chipsets act up (they disconnect from the bus) when sending
more then 32 commands to them at once.

Rather then building an ever growing list with usb-id based quirks for
devices using this chipset, simply reduce the qdepth to 32 when connected
over usb-2. 32 should be plenty to keep things close to maximum
possible throughput on usb-2.
