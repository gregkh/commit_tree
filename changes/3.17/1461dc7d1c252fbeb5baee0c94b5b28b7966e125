cpufreq: don't restore policy->cpus on failure to move kobj

While hot-unplugging policy->cpu, we call cpufreq_nominate_new_policy_cpu() to
nominate next owner of policy, i.e. policy->cpu. If we fail to move policy
kobject under the new policy->cpu, we try to update policy->cpus with the old
policy->cpu.

This would have been required in case old-CPU is removed from policy->cpus in
the first place. But its not done before calling
cpufreq_nominate_new_policy_cpu(), but during the POST_DEAD notification which
happens quite late in the hot-unplugging path.

So, this is just some useless code hanging around, get rid of it.
