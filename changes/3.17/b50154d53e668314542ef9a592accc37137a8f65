ACPI: Don't use acpi_lapic in ACPI core code

Now ARM64 support is being added to ACPI so architecture specific
values can not be used in core ACPI code.

Following on the patch "ACPI / processor: Check if LAPIC is present
during initialization" which uses acpi_lapic in acpi_processor.c,
on ARM64 platform, GIC is used instead of local APIC, so acpi_lapic
is not a suitable value for ARM64.

What is actually important at this point is if there is/are CPU
entry/entries (Local APIC/SAPIC, GICC) in MADT, so introduce
acpi_has_cpu_in_madt() to be arch specific and generic.
