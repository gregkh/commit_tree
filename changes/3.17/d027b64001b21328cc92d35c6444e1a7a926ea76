perf machine: Fix the lifetime of the VDSO temporary file

The VDSO temporary file is unlinked when a session is deleted.  That
precludes the possibilities that there is no session or there is more
than one session.

Correctly the vdso belongs to the machine so put the information on
'struct machine' and get rid of the global variables.
