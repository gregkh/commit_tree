ALSA: hda - Fix invalid pin powermap without jack detection

When a driver is set up without the jack detection explicitly (either
by passing a model option or via a specific fixup), the pin powermap
of IDT/STAC codecs is set up wrongly, resulting in the silence
output.  It's because of a logic failure in stac_init_power_map().
It tries to avoid creating a callback for the pins that have other
auto-hp and auto-mic callbacks, but the check is done in a wrong way
at a wrong time.  The stac_init_power_map() should be called after
creating other jack detection ctls, and the jack callback should be
created only for jack-detectable widgets.

This patch fixes the check in stac_init_power_map() and its callee
at the right place, after snd_hda_gen_build_controls().
