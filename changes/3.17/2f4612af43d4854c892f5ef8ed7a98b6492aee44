mm,hugetlb: make unmap_ref_private() return void

This function always returns 1, thus no need to check return value in
hugetlb_cow().  By doing so, we can get rid of the unnecessary WARN_ON
call.  While this logic perhaps existed as a way of identifying future
unmap_ref_private() mishandling, reality is it serves no apparent
purpose.
