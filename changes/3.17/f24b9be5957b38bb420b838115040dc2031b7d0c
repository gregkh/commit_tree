net-timestamp: extend SCM_TIMESTAMPING ancillary data struct

Applications that request kernel tx timestamps with SO_TIMESTAMPING
read timestamps as recvmsg() ancillary data. The response is defined
implicitly as timespec[3].

1) define struct scm_timestamping explicitly and

2) add support for new tstamp types. On tx, scm_timestamping always
   accompanies a sock_extended_err. Define previously unused field
   ee_info to signal the type of ts[0]. Introduce SCM_TSTAMP_SND to
   define the existing behavior.

The reception path is not modified. On rx, no struct similar to
sock_extended_err is passed along with SCM_TIMESTAMPING.
