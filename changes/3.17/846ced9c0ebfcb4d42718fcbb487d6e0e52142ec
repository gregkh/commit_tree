[media] coda: add decoder timestamp queue

The coda driver advertises timestamp_type V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_COPY on
both queues, so we have to copy timestamps from input v4l2 buffers to the
corresponding destination v4l2 buffers. Since the h.264 decoder can reorder
frames, a timestamp queue is needed to keep track of and assign the correct
timestamp to destination buffers.
