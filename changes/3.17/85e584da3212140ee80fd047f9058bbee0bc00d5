xfs: don't zero partial page cache pages during O_DIRECT writes

xfs is using truncate_pagecache_range to invalidate the page cache
during DIO reads.  This is different from the other filesystems who
only invalidate pages during DIO writes.

truncate_pagecache_range is meant to be used when we are freeing the
underlying data structs from disk, so it will zero any partial
ranges in the page.  This means a DIO read can zero out part of the
page cache page, and it is possible the page will stay in cache.

buffered reads will find an up to date page with zeros instead of
the data actually on disk.

This patch fixes things by using invalidate_inode_pages2_range
instead.  It preserves the page cache invalidation, but won't zero
any pages.
