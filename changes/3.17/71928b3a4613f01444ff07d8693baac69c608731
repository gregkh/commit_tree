Staging: bcm: Fixed indention for inner if-block

The inner if-statement was aligned just like the outer one. Why?

This indention was introduced by

    f34c488c3894968e8cdbdc3b1ed617d78315cace

which is a indention-fix patch itself. That's why I'm curious about it.

I did not merge these nested if-statements, as I don't know if I'm
destroying logical seperated checks with it.
