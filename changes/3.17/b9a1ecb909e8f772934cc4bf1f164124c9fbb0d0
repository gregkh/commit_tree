KVM: x86: Setting rflags.rf during rep-string emulation

This patch updates RF for rep-string emulation.  The flag is set upon the first
iteration, and cleared after the last (if emulated). It is intended to make
sure that if a trap (in future data/io #DB emulation) or interrupt is delivered
to the guest during the rep-string instruction, RF will be set correctly. RF
affects whether instruction breakpoint in the guest is masked.
