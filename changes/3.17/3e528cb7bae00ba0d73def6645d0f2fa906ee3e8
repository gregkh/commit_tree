bus: arm-ccn: Fix error handling at event allocation

The bitfield allocation function returns error condition
as a negative value, but in two cases its result
was assigned to an unsigned member of the hw_perf_event
structure, thus the error would not be ever detected.

Fixed by using an intermediate, signed variable.
