video: ARM CLCD: Fix color model capabilities for DT platforms

The DT-based panel capabilities selection was picking up
a subset of available modes based on hardware configuration.
This was wrong, as the capabilities describe available
memory models and adapt the display controller to them
that the RGB output is wired up correctly (as in: R and
B components are not swapped).

This patch fixes it by removing the unnecessary limitation.
