kexec: make kexec_segment user buffer pointer a union

So far kexec_segment->buf was always a user space pointer as user space
passed the array of kexec_segment structures and kernel copied it.

But with new system call, list of kexec segments will be prepared by
kernel and kexec_segment->buf will point to a kernel memory.

So while I was adding code where I made assumption that ->buf is pointing
to kernel memory, sparse started giving warning.

Make ->buf a union.  And where a user space pointer is expected, access it
using ->buf and where a kernel space pointer is expected, access it using
->kbuf.  That takes care of sparse warnings.
