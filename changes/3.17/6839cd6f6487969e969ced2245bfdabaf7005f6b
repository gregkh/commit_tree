regulator: palmas: Rename palmas_regs_info to palmas_generic_regs_info

With commit d6f83370ed978d5570b7c8c22988310cb9376202 (regulator: palmas:
Add tps65917 PMIC support) palmas_regs_info naming is confusing as it is
a driver data parameter and a local variable. To prevent mistaken
updates, rename the local variable to palmas_generic_regs_info.
