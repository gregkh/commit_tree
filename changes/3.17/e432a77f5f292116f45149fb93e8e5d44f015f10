staging: lustre: remove hpdd-discuss list from TODO file

It's a closed mailing list, what's the use of cc:ing patches there if
they never go through.  So remove it from the TODO file.

A real MAINTAINERS entry is probably a good thing for the Lustre code,
maybe someday someone will send a patch to do that...
