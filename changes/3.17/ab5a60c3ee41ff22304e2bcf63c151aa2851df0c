drm/omap: use __GFP_DMA32 for shmem-backed gem

OMAP requires bo-pages to be in the DMA32 zone. Explicitly request this by
setting __GFP_DMA32 as mapping-gfp-mask during shmem initialization. This
drops HIGHMEM from the gfp-mask and uses DMA32 instead. shmem-core takes
care to relocate pages during swap-in in case they have been loaded into
the wrong zone.

It is _not_ possible to pass __GFP_DMA32 to shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp()
as the page might have already been swapped-in at that time. The zone-mask
must be set during initialization and be kept constant for now.

Remove the now superfluous TODO in omap_gem.c.
