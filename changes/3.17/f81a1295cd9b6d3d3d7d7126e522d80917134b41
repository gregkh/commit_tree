Input: wacom - prepare the driver to include BT devices

Now that wacom is a hid driver, there is no point in having a separate
driver for bluetooth devices. This patch prepares the common paths of
Bluetooth devices in the common wacom driver. It also adds the sysfs file
"speed" used by Bluetooth devices.
