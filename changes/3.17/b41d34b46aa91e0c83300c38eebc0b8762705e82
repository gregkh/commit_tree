kexec: remove CONFIG_KEXEC dependency on crypto

New system call depends on crypto.  As it did not have a separate config
option, CONFIG_KEXEC was modified to select CRYPTO and CRYPTO_SHA256.

But now previous patch introduced a new config option for new syscall.
So CONFIG_KEXEC does not require crypto.  Remove that dependency.
