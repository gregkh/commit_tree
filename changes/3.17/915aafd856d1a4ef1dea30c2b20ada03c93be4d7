bnx2i, be2iscsi: fix custom stats length

The custom stats is an array with custom_length indicating the length
of the array. This patch fixes bnx2i and be2iscsi's setting of the
custom stats length. They both just have the one, eh_abort_cnt, so that should
be in the first entry of the custom array and custom_length should then
be one.
