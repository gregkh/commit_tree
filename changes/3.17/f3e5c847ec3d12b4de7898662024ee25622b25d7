arm64: Add __NR_* definitions for compat syscalls

This patch adds __NR_* definitions to asm/unistd32.h, moves the
__NR_compat_* definitions to asm/unistd.h and removes all the explicit
unistd32.h includes apart from the one building the compat syscall
table. The aim is to have the compat __NR_* definitions available but
without colliding with the native syscall definitions (required by
lib/compat_audit.c to avoid duplicating the audit header files between
native and compat).
