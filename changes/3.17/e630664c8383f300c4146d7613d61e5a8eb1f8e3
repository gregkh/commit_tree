mlx4_core: Add helper functions to support MR re-registration

Add few helper functions to support a mechanism of getting an MPT,
modifying it and updating the HCA with the modified object.

The code takes 2 paths, one for directly changing the MPT (and
sometimes its related MTTs) and another one which queries the MPT and
updates the HCA via fw command SW2HW_MPT. The first path is used in
native mode; the second path is slower and is used only in SRIOV.
