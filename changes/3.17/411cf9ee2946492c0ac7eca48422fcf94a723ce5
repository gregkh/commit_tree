x86, vsmp: Remove is_vsmp_box() from apic_is_clustered_box()

When a vSMP Foundation box is detected, the function apic_cluster_num() counts
the number of APIC clusters found. If more than one found, a multi board
configuration is assumed, and TSC marked as unstable. This behavior is
incorrect as vSMP Foundation may use processors from single node only, attached
to memory of other nodes - and such node may have more than one APIC cluster
(typically any recent intel box has more than single APIC_CLUSTERID(x)).

To fix this, we simply remove the code which detects a vSMP Foundation box and
affects apic_is_clusted_box() return value. This can be done because later the
kernel checks by itself if the TSC is stable using the
check_tsc_sync_[source|target]() functions and marks TSC as unstable if needed.
