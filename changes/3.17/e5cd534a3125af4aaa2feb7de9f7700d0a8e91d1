MIPS: Remove incorrect NULL check in local_flush_tlb_page()

We check that the struct vm_area_struct pointer vma is NULL and then
dereference it a few lines below. The intent was to make sure vma is
not NULL but this is not necessary since the bug pre-dates GIT history
and seem to never have caused a problem. The tlb-4k and tlb-8k versions
of local_flush_tlb_page() don't bother checking if vma is NULL, also
vma is dereferenced before being passed to local_flush_tlb_page(),
thus it is safe to remove this NULL check.
