ARM: 8089/1: cpu_pj4b_suspend_size should base on cpu_v7_suspend_size

Since pj4b suspend/resume routines are implemented based on generic
ARMv7 ones, instead of hard-coding cpu_pj4b_suspend_size, we should have
it be cpu_v7_suspend_size plus pj4b specific bytes.  Otherwise, if
cpu_v7_suspend_size gets updated alone, the pj4b suspend/resume will
likely be broken.

While at it, fix the comments in cpu_pj4b_do_resume, as we're restoring
CP15 registers rather than saving in there.
