MIPS: Malta: Fix dispatching of GIC interrupts

The Malta malta_ipi_irqdispatch() routine now checks only IPI interrupts
when handling IPIs. It could previously call do_IRQ() for non-IPIs, and
also call do_IRQ() with an invalid IRQ number if there were no pending
GIC interrupts when gic_get_int() was called.
