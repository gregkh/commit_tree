fs/befs/linuxvfs.c: check superblock before dump operation

befs_dump_super_block was called between befs_load_sb and befs_check_sb.
It has been reported to crash (5/900) with null block testing.

This patch loads, checks and only dump superblock if it's a valid one
then brelse bh.

(befs_dump_super_block uses disk_sb (bh->b_data) so it seems we need to
call it before brelse(bh) but I don't know why befs_check_sb was called
after brelse.  Another thing I don't understand is why this problem
appears now).
