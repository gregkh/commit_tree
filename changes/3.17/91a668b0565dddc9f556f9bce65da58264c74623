Bluetooth: Fix setting HCI_CONNECTABLE from ioctl code

When the white list is in use the code would not update the
HCI_CONNECTABLE flag if it gets changed through the ioctl code (e.g.
hciconfig hci0 pscan). Since the flag is important for properly
accepting incoming connections add code to fix it up if necessary and
emit a New Settings mgmt event.
