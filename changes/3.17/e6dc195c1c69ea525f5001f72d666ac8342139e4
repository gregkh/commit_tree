ARM: integrator: get rid of <mach/memory.h>

The Integrator has a custom <mach/memory.h> header defining the
BUS_OFFSET for *_to_bus and bus_to_* operations as offset from
0x80000000.

This switches the Integrator over to using the mechanism
introduced for the Keystone to provide the same offset using
the device tree, deletes <mach/memory.h> and augments the
Integrator device tree to provide the bus offset.
