nfsd: make NFSv2 null terminate symlink data

It's simple enough for NFSv2 to null-terminate the symlink data.

A bit weird (it depends on knowing that we've already read the following
byte, which is either padding or part of the mode), but no worse than
the conditional kstrdup it otherwise relies on in nfsd_symlink().
