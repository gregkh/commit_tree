net: provide stubs for ip6_set_txhash and ip6_make_flowlabel

Commit cb1ce2ef387b ("ipv6: Implement automatic flow label generation
on transmit") introduced ip6_make_flowlabel, while commit b73c3d0e4f0e
("net: Save TX flow hash in sock and set in skbuf on xmit") introduced
ip6_set_txhash.

ip6_set_tx_hash() uses sk_v6_daddr which references
__sk_common.skc_v6_daddr from struct sock_common, which is gated with
IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6).

ip6_make_flowlabel() uses the ipv6 member from struct net which is
also gated with IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6).

When CONFIG_IPV6 is disabled, we will hit a build failure that looks
like this when the compiler attempts inlining these functions:
