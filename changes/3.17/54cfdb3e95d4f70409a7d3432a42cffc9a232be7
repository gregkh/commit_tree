KVM: emulate: speed up emulated moves

We can just blindly move all 16 bytes of ctxt->src's value to ctxt->dst.
write_register_operand will take care of writing only the lower bytes.

Avoiding a call to memcpy (the compiler optimizes it out) gains about
200 cycles on kvm-unit-tests for register-to-register moves, and makes
them about as fast as arithmetic instructions.

We could perhaps get a larger speedup by moving all instructions _except_
moves out of x86_emulate_insn, removing opcode_len, and replacing the
switch statement with an inlined em_mov.
