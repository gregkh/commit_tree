net-timestamp: ACK timestamp for bytestreams

Add SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_ACK, a request for a tstamp when the last byte
in the send() call is acknowledged. It implements the feature for TCP.

The timestamp is generated when the TCP socket cumulative ACK is moved
beyond the tracked seqno for the first time. The feature ignores SACK
and FACK, because those acknowledge the specific byte, but not
necessarily the entire contents of the buffer up to that byte.
