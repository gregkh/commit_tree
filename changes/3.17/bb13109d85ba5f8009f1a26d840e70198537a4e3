ASoC: Split component registration into two steps

Split snd_soc_component_register() into snd_soc_component_initialize() and
snd_soc_component_add(). Using a 2-stage registration approach has the advantage
that it is possible to modify the component after it has been initialized, but
before it is made visible to the system. This e.g. allows CODECs or platforms to
overwrite some of the default settings made in snd_soc_component_initialize().

Similar snd_soc_component_unregister() is split into two steps as well,
snd_soc_component_delete(), which removes the component from the system, and
snd_soc_component_cleanup(), which frees all the resources allocated by the
component.

Furthermore this patch makes sure that if a component is visible on two list
(e.g. the component list and the CODEC list) it is added or removed to both
lists atomically.
