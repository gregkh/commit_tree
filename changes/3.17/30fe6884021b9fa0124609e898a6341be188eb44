cpuidle: move idle traces to cpuidle_enter_state()

idle_exit event is the first event after a core exits
idle state. So this should be traced before local irq
is ebabled. Likewise idle_entry is the last event before
a core enters idle state. This will ease visualising the
cpu idle state from kernel traces.
