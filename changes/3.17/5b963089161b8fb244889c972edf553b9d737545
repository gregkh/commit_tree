hwmon: (lm92) Prevent overflow problem when writing large limits

On platforms with sizeof(int) < sizeof(long), writing a temperature
limit larger than MAXINT will result in unpredictable limit values
written to the chip. Avoid auto-conversion from long to int to fix
the problem.

The hysteresis temperature range depends on the value of
data->temp[attr->index], since val is subtracted from it.
Use a wider clamp, [-120000, 220000] should do to cover the
possible range. Also add missing TEMP_TO_REG() on writes into
cached hysteresis value.

Also uses clamp_val to simplify the code a bit.
