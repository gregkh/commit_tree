[media] sms: Remove CONFIG_ prefix from Kconfig symbols

X-Patchwork-Delegate: mchehab@redhat.com
Remove the CONFIG_ prefix from two Kconfig symbols in a dependency for
SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS. This prefix is invalid inside Kconfig files.

Note that the current (common sense) dependency on SMS_USB_DRV and
SMS_SDIO_DRV being equal ensures that SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS will not
violate its constraints. These constraint are that:
- it should only be built if SMS_USB_DRV is set;
- it can't be builtin if USB support is modular.

So drop the dependency on SMS_USB_DRV, as it is unneeded.
