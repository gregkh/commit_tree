btrfs: correctly handle return from ulist_add

ulist_add() can return '1' on sucess, which qgroup_subtree_accounting()
doesn't take into account. As a result, that value can be bubbled up to
callers, causing an error to be printed. Fix this by only returning the
value of ulist_add() when it indicates an error.
