virtio-net: rx busy polling support

Add basic support for rx busy polling. Instead of introducing new
states and spinlock to synchronize between NAPI and polling method,
this patch just reuse NAPI state to avoid extra overhead for fast path
and simplified the codes.

Test was done between a kvm guest and an external host. Two hosts were
connected through 40gb mlx4 cards. With both busy_poll and busy_read
are set to 50 in guest, 1 byte netperf tcp_rr shows 127% improvement:
transaction rate was increased from 8353.33 to 18966.87.
