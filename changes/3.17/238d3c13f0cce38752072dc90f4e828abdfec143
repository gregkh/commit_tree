mm, hugetlb: generalize writes to nr_hugepages

Three different interfaces alter the maximum number of hugepages for an
hstate:

 - /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages for global number of hugepages of the default
   hstate,

 - /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-X/nr_hugepages for global number of
   hugepages for a specific hstate, and

 - /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-X/nr_hugepages/mempolicy for number of
   hugepages for a specific hstate over the set of allowed nodes.

Generalize the code so that a single function handles all of these
writes instead of duplicating the code in two different functions.

This decreases the number of lines of code, but also reduces the size of
.text by about half a percent since set_max_huge_pages() can be inlined.
