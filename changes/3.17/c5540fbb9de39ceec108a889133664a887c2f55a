[media] rc-core: remove protocol arrays

The basic API of rc-core used to be:

	dev = rc_allocate_device();
	dev->x = a;
	dev->y = b;
	dev->z = c;
	rc_register_device();

which is a pretty common pattern in the kernel, after the introduction of
protocol arrays the API looks something like:

	dev = rc_allocate_device();
	dev->x = a;
	rc_set_allowed_protocols(dev, RC_BIT_X);
	dev->z = c;
	rc_register_device();

There's no real need for the protocols to be an array, so change it
back to be consistent (and in preparation for the following patches).
