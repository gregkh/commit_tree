usbcore: Fix wrong device in an error message in hub_port_connect()

The commit [5ee0f803cc3a: usbcore: don't log on consecutive debounce
failures of the same port] added the check of the reliable port, but
it also replaced the device argument to dev_err() wrongly, which leads
to a NULL dereference.

This patch restores the right device, port_dev->dev.  Also, since
dev_err() itself shows the port number, reduce the port number shown
in the error message, essentially reverting to the state before the
commit 5ee0f803cc3a.

[The fix suggested by Hannes, and the error message cleanup suggested
 by Alan Stern]
