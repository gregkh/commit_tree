net: arcnet: Remove "#define bool int"

The header file include/linux/arcdevice.h #defines bool to int, if
bool is not already #defined. However, the files which use that header
file seem to rely on that #define (unconditionally) being in effect:
the prototypes for the functions arcrimi_reset, com20020_reset,
com90io_reset, com90xx_reset (whose addresses are assigned to the
hw.reset member of struct arcnet_local) use int explicitly.

Moreover, that #define is an accident waiting to happen (scenario:
inclusion of arcdevice.h followed by inclusion of some header which
declares function prototypes using bool). Also, #include
<linux/types.h> must appear before #include <linux/arcdevice.h> (the
compiler wouldn't like "typedef _Bool int").

Since none of the files using arcdevice.h declare variables of type
"bool", the patch is actually quite simple, unlike the commit message.
