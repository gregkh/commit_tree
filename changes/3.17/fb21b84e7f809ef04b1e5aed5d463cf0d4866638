x86_32, entry: Clean up sysenter_badsys declaration

commit 554086d85e "x86_32, entry: Do syscall exit work on badsys
(CVE-2014-4508)" introduced a new jump label (sysenter_badsys) but
somehow the END statements seem to have gone wrong (at least it
feels that way to me).
This does not seem to be a fatal problem, but just for the sake
of symmetry, change the second syscall_badsys to sysenter_badsys.
