ip_tunnel: Don't allow to add the same tunnel multiple times.

When we try to add an already existing tunnel, we don't return
an error. Instead we continue and call ip_tunnel_update().
This means that we can change existing tunnels by adding
the same tunnel multiple times. It is even possible to change
the tunnel endpoints of the fallback device.

We fix this by returning an error if we try to add an existing
tunnel.
