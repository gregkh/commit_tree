ACPICA: Utilities: Cleanup DEFINE_ACPI_GLOBALS by moving acpi_ut_init_global() from utglobal.c to utinit.c

The utglobal.c is used to define and initialize global variables.  It makes
sense if just adding utglobal.o to applications that are using such
variables. But acpi_ut_init_globals() is preventing us from doing so as
this initialization function references other components' initializations
code, which leads to the requirement that many files should also get linked
if one wants to link utglobal.o.

It is possible to just move acpi_ut_init_global() to utinit.c for
applications that require this function to link.

By linking utglobal.o, we can stop defining DEFINE_ACPI_GLOBALS for
applications (currently only acpidump is affected). Lv Zheng.
