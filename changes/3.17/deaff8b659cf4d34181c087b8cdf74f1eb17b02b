perf tools: Fix jump label always changing during tracing

Intel PT decoding walks the object code to reconstruct the trace.  A
jump label change during tracing causes decoding errors.

The "Enable close-on-exec flag on perf file descriptor" patch caused
there to be always a jump label change.

It was found that using a per-cpu context instead of a per-thread
context for the probe of the close-on-exec feature, made the problem go
away.
