KVM: vmx: handle_cr ignores 32/64-bit mode

On 32-bit mode only bits [31:0] of the CR should be used for setting the CR
value.  Otherwise, the host may incorrectly assume the value is invalid if bits
[63:32] are not zero.  Moreover, the CR is currently being read twice when CR8
is used.  Last, nested mov-cr exiting is modified to handle the CR value
correctly as well.
