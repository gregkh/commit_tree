klist: use same naming scheme as hlist for klist_add_after()

The name was modified from hlist_add_after() to hlist_add_behind() when
adjusting the order of arguments to match the one with
klist_add_after().  This is necessary to break old code when it would
use it the wrong way.

Make klist follow this naming scheme for consistency.
