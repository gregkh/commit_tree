staging: comedi: mite: pass comedi_device to mite_setup()

For aesthetics, pass the comedi_device to mite_setup() and mite_setup2()
so that the dev->class_dev can be used in the dev_{level} message to make
the messages have consistancy with the other comedi drivers.

Remove the extra dev_warn() noise in the drivers when mite_setup() fails.

Rename the 'use_iodwbsr_1' parameter and change it to a bool.
