crypto: caam - Introduce the use of the managed version of kzalloc

This patch moves data allocated using kzalloc to managed data allocated
using devm_kzalloc and cleans now unnecessary kfrees in probe and remove
functions.  Also, linux/device.h is added to make sure the devm_*()
routine declarations are unambiguously available. Earlier, in the probe
function ctrlpriv was leaked on the failure of ctrl = of_iomap(nprop, 0);
as well as on the failure of ctrlpriv->jrpdev = kzalloc(...); . These
two bugs have been fixed by the patch.

The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used for making the change:

identifier p, probefn, removefn;
@@
struct platform_driver p = {
  .probe = probefn,
  .remove = removefn,
};

@prb@
identifier platform.probefn, pdev;
expression e, e1, e2;
@@
probefn(struct platform_device *pdev, ...) {
  <+...
- e = kzalloc(e1, e2)
+ e = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, e1, e2)
  ...

  ...+>
}

@rem depends on prb@
