i40e: Add ndo_get_phys_port_id() callback support

This patch adds a new API to get the port mac address from firmware.
It also adds support to the ndo_get_phys_port_id() callback to provide
port specific unique id to the netdev layer.
If the adapter has a valid per-port mac address then that
would be used for this purpose and is expected to be unique
on a per-port basis.

The information can be viewed by reading the phys_port_id
attribute in sysfs for each netdev or via IF netlink
interface.
