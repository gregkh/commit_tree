sparc64: ldc_connect() should not return EINVAL when handshake is in progress.

The LDC handshake could have been asynchronously triggered
after ldc_bind() enables the ldc_rx() receive interrupt-handler
(and thus intercepts incoming control packets)
and before vio_port_up() calls ldc_connect(). If that is the case,
ldc_connect() should return 0 and let the state-machine
progress.
