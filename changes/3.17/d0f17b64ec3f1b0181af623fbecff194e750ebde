drivers: staging: lustre: Use 'force_die' instead of 'die' to avoid compiling issue

Some of architectures have already defined 'die' as macro, so can not
use it as declaration or definition in other modules, or it will cause
compiling issue.

So use more precise name 'force_die' (like 'wrap_bulk') instead of. And
the related error (with allmodconfig under score):
