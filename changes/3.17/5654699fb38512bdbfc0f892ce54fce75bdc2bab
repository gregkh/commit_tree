USB: serial: fix potential heap buffer overflow

Make sure to verify the number of ports requested by subdriver to avoid
writing beyond the end of fixed-size array in interface data.

The current usb-serial implementation is limited to eight ports per
interface but failed to verify that the number of ports requested by a
subdriver (which could have been determined from device descriptors) did
not exceed this limit.
