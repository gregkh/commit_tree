Documentation: headers_install.txt is part of kbuild

'headers_install.txt' from Documentation/make/ is related to Kbuild
so it must be moved in Documentation/kbuild/ directory.

As Documentation/make/ directory has only one file, it will be removed
as a consequence of moving 'headers_install.txt'.
