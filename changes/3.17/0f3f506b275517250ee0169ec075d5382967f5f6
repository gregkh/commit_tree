MIPS: Support hard limit of cpu count (nr_cpu_ids)

On MIPS currently, only the soft limit of cpu count (maxcpus) has its
effect, this patch enable the hard limit (nr_cpus) as well. Processor
cores which greater than maxcpus and less than nr_cpus can be taken up
via cpu hotplug. The code is borrowed from X86.
