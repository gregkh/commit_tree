f2fs: reduce region of f2fs_lock_op covered for better concurrency

In our rename process, region of f2fs_lock_op covered is too big as some of the
code like f2fs_empty_dir/f2fs_find_entry are not needed to protect by this lock.

So in the extreme case like doing checkpoint when we rename old inode to exist
inode in a large directory could cause lower concurrency.

Let's reduce the region of f2fs_lock_op to fix this.
