xtensa: make fixmap region addressing grow with index

It's much easier to reason about alignment and coloring of regions
located in the fixmap when fixmap index is just a PFN within the fixmap
region. Change fixmap addressing so that index 0 corresponds to
FIXADDR_START instead of the FIXADDR_TOP.
