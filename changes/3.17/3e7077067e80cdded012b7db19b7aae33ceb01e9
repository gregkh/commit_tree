phy: Expand phy speed/duplex settings array

Expand the phy speed/duplex settings array to support more
than just baseT features. This change adds entries to support
the following additional speed/duplex/media types:
	SUPPORTED_10000baseKR_Full
	SUPPORTED_10000baseKX4_Full
	SUPPORTED_2500baseX_Full
	SUPPORTED_1000baseKX_Full

Additionally, it changes the 10GbE baseT entry from using the
hardcoded value 10000 to the SPEED_10000 define.
