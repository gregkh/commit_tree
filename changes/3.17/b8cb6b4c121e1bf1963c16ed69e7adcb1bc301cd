md/raid1: fix_read_error should act on all non-faulty devices.

If a devices is being recovered it is not InSync and is not Faulty.

If a read error is experienced on that device, fix_read_error()
will be called, but it ignores non-InSync devices.  So it will
neither fix the error nor fail the device.

It is incorrect that fix_read_error() ignores non-InSync devices.
It should only ignore Faulty devices.  So fix it.

This became a bug when we allowed reading from a device that was being
recovered.  It is suitable for any subsequent -stable kernel.
