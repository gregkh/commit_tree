Revert "selinux: fix the default socket labeling in sock_graft()"

This reverts commit 4da6daf4d3df5a977e4623963f141a627fd2efce.

Unfortunately, the commit in question caused problems with Bluetooth
devices, specifically it caused them to get caught in the newly
created BUG_ON() check.  The AF_ALG problem still exists, but will be
addressed in a future patch.
