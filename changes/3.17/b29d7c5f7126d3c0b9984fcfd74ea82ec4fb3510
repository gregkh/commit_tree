ASoC: Intel: byt-max98090: Do not change speaker and DMIC with jack state

Kernel should not enable/disable speakers and digital microphone whenever
jack is inserted/removed. This is more use-case than kernel specific
decision. For instance one may want to play VoIP ring tones using both
speakers and headphone but play music only from one of them.

Because of above reason remove "Ext Spk" and "Int Mic" update when jack
state is changed. Also this update was illogical anyway: "Ext Spk" was
enabled when jack was inserted and disabled when jack was removed.
