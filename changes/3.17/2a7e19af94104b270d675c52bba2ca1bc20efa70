e1000e: Fix Runtime PM blocks EEE link negotiation in S5

Adding a function, and associated calls, to flush writes to (read) the LPIC
MAC register before entering the shutdown flow.  This fixes the problem
of the PHY never negotiating a 100M link (if both sides of the link support
EEE and 100M link) when Runtime PM is enabled.
