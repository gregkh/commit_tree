mmc: mmci: Reverse IRQ handling for the arm_variant

Commit "mmc: mmci: Handle CMD irq before DATA irq", caused an issue
when using the ARM model of the PL181 and running QEMU.

The bug was reported for the following QEMU version:
$ qemu-system-arm -version
QEMU emulator version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.1), Copyright
(c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

To resolve the problem, let's restore the old behavior were the DATA
irq is handled prior the CMD irq, but only for the arm_variant, which
the problem was reported for.
