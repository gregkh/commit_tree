MIPS: Alchemy: add helpers to access static memory ctrl registers.

This patch changes the static memory controller registers to offsets
from base, prefixes them with AU1000_ to avoid silent failures due to
changed addresses and introduces helpers to access them.

No functional changes, comparing assembly of a few select functions shows
no differences.
