fuse: honour max_read and max_write in direct_io mode

The third argument of fuse_get_user_pages() "nbytesp" refers to the number of
bytes a caller asked to pack into fuse request. This value may be lesser
than capacity of fuse request or iov_iter.  So fuse_get_user_pages() must
ensure that *nbytesp won't grow.

Now, when helper iov_iter_get_pages() performs all hard work of extracting
pages from iov_iter, it can be done by passing properly calculated
"maxsize" to the helper.

The other caller of iov_iter_get_pages() (dio_refill_pages()) doesn't need
this capability, so pass LONG_MAX as the maxsize argument here.
