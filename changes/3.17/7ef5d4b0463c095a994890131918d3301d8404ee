IB/mad: Update module to [pr|dev]_* style print messages

Use dev_* style print when struct device is available.

Also combine previously line broken user-visible strings as per
Documentation/CodingStyle:

"However, never break user-visible strings such as printk messages,
because that breaks the ability to grep for them."
