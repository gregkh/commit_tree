fbdev: Remove __init from chips_hw_init() to fix build failure

Fix build failure caused as follows:

The function chipsfb_pci_init() references
the function __init chips_hw_init().
This is often because chipsfb_pci_init lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of chips_hw_init is wrong.

make: *** [drivers] Error 2

by removing the __init annotation from chips_hw_init(). The other thing that
could have been done was annotating chipsfb_pci_init(). But that cannot be done
since chipsfb_pci_init() is called from non __init functions.
