drm/radeon: Inline r100_mm_rreg, -wreg, v3

This was originally un-inlined by Andi Kleen in 2011 citing size concerns.
Indeed, a first attempt at inlining it grew radeon.ko by 7%.

However, 2% of cpu is spent in this function. Simply inlining it gave 1% more fps
in Urban Terror.

v2: We know the minimum MMIO size. Adding it to the if allows the compiler to
optimize the branch out, improving both performance and size.

The v2 patch decreases radeon.ko size by 2%. I didn't re-benchmark, but common sense
says perf is now more than 1% better.

v3: Also change _wreg, make the threshold a define.

Inlining _wreg increased the size a bit compared to v2, so now radeon.ko
is only 1% smaller.
