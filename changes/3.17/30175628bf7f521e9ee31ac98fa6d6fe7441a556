[SMB3] Enable fallocate -z support for SMB3 mounts

fallocate -z (FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE) can map to SMB3
FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA SMB3 FSCTL but FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE
when called without the FALLOC_FL_KEEPSIZE flag set could want
the file size changed so we can not support that subcase unless
the file is cached (and thus we know the file size).
