cpufreq: fix cpufreq suspend/resume for intel_pstate

Cpufreq core introduces cpufreq_suspended flag to let cpufreq sysfs nodes
across S2RAM/S2DISK. But the flag is only set in the cpufreq_suspend()
for cpufreq drivers which have target or target_index callback. This
skips intel_pstate driver. This patch is to set the flag before checking
target or target_index callback.
