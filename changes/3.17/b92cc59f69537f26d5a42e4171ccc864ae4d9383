xfs: kill xfs_vnode.h

Move the IO flag definitions to xfs_inode.h and kill the header file
as it is now empty.

Removing the xfs_vnode.h file showed up an implicit header include
path:
	xfs_linux.h -> xfs_vnode.h -> xfs_fs.h

And so every xfs header file has been inplicitly been including
xfs_fs.h where it is needed or not. Hence the removal of xfs_vnode.h
causes all sorts of build issues because BBTOB() and friends are no
longer automatically included in the build. This also gets fixed.
