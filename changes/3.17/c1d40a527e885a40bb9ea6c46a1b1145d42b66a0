scsi: add a blacklist flag which enables VPD page inquiries

Despite supporting modern SCSI features some storage devices continue to
claim conformance to an older version of the SPC spec. This is done for
compatibility with legacy operating systems.

Linux by default will not attempt to read VPD pages on devices that
claim SPC-2 or older. Introduce a blacklist flag that can be used to
trigger VPD page inquiries on devices that are known to support them.
