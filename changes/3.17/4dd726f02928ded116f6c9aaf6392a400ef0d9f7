drbd: get rid of drbd_queue_work_front

The last user was al_write_transaction, if called with "delegate",
and the last user to call it with "delegate = true" was the receiver
thread, which has no need to delegate, but can call it himself.

Finally drop the delegate parameter, drop the extra
w_al_write_transaction callback, and drop drbd_queue_work_front.

Do not (yet) change dequeue_work_item to dequeue_work_batch, though.
