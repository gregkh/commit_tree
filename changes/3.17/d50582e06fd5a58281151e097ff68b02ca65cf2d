xen/arm: remove mach_to_phys rbtree

Remove the rbtree used to keep track of machine to physical mappings:
the frontend can grant the same page multiple times, leading to errors
inserting or removing entries from the mach_to_phys tree.

Linux only needed to know the physical address corresponding to a given
machine address in swiotlb-xen. Now that swiotlb-xen can call the
xen_dma_* functions passing the machine address directly, we can remove
it.
