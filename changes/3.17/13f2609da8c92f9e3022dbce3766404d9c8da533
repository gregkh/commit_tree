staging: comedi: s626: remove 'get_int_src' callback from encoder private data

There are two functions used for the 'get_int_src' callback. One is used for
the channel 0-2 encoders and the other for the channel 3-5 encoders.

Refactor the two callbacks into a single s626_get_int_srsc() function and use
the encoder channel number to handle the differences.

Remove the then unnecessary 'get_int_src' member from the encoder private data.

The 'get_int_src' callbacks were not being used by the driver. For now block
the s626_get_int_src() function with '#ifdef unused' to prevent a compiler
warning.
