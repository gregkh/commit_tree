KVM: vmx: vmx instructions handling does not consider cs.l

VMX instructions use 32-bit operands in 32-bit mode, and 64-bit operands in
64-bit mode.  The current implementation is broken since it does not use the
register operands correctly, and always uses 64-bit for reads and writes.
Moreover, write to memory in vmwrite only considers long-mode, so it ignores
cs.l. This patch fixes this behavior.
