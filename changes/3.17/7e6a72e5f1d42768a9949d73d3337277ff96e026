nfsd: fix file access refcount leak when nfsd4_truncate fails

nfsd4_process_open2 will currently will get access to the file, and then
call nfsd4_truncate to (possibly) truncate it. If that operation fails
though, then the access references will never be released as the
nfs4_ol_stateid is never initialized.

Fix by moving the nfsd4_truncate call into nfs4_get_vfs_file, ensuring
that the refcounts are properly put if the truncate fails.
