CIFS: Use multicredits for SMB 2.1/3 writes

If we negotiate SMB 2.1 and higher version of the protocol and
a server supports large write buffer size, we need to consume 1
credit per 65536 bytes. So, we need to know how many credits
we have and obtain the required number of them before constructing
a writedata structure in writepages and iovec write.
