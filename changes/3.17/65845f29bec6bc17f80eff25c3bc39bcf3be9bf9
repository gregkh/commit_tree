ALSA: firewire-lib/dice: add arrangements of PCM pointer and interrupts for Dice quirk

In IEC 61883-6, one data block transfers one event. In ALSA, the event equals one PCM frame,
hence one data block transfers one PCM frame. But Dice has a quirk at higher sampling rate
(176.4/192.0 kHz) that one data block transfers two PCM frames.

Commit 10550bea44a8 ("ALSA: dice/firewire-lib: Keep dualwire mode but obsolete
CIP_HI_DUALWIRE") moved some codes related to this quirk into Dice driver. But the commit
forgot to add arrangements for PCM period interrupts and DMA pointer updates. As a result, Dice
driver cannot work correctly at higher sampling rate.

This commit adds 'double_pcm_frames' parameter to amdtp structure for this quirk. When this
parameter is set, PCM period interrupts and DMA pointer updates occur at double speed than in
IEC 61883-6.
