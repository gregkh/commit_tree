nfs: remove pgio_header refcount, related cleanup

The refcounting on nfs_pgio_header was related to there being (possibly)
more than one nfs_pgio_data. Now that nfs_pgio_data has been merged into
nfs_pgio_header, there is no reason to do this ref counting.  Just call
the completion callback on nfs_pgio_release/nfs_pgio_error.
