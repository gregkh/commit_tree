be2net: fix return status of some ndo methods

The netlink layer expects a -ve status value to be returned when a driver
ndo method encounters an error. The driver was directly passing the
error status returned by FW (a positive value) to the stack.
This patch fixes this by returning -EIO status when a FW-cmd reports an error.
