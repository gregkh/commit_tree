[media] media: em28xx - remove reset_resume interface

em28xx uses resume interface as its reset_resume interface.
If usb device is reset during suspend, reset_resume doesn't
do the necessary initialization which leads to resume failure.
Many systems don't maintain do not maintain suspend current to
the USB host controllers during hibernation. Remove reset_resume
to allow disconnect to be called followed by device restore
sequence.
