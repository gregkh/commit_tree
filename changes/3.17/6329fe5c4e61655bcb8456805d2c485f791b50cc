defxx: Discard DMA maps on buffer deallocation

Prearranged receive DMA bounce buffer mappings are not released in the
card reboot/shutdown path.  That does not affect frame reception, but
probably explains the random segmentation fault I observed the other day
on interface shutdown.  Card is rebooted as required by the spec in the
process of ring fault recovery when a PC Trace signal has been received.

This change fixes the problem in an obvious manner.
