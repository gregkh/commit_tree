sched/numa: Use group's max nid as task's preferred nid

From task_numa_placement, always try to consolidate the tasks
in a group on the group's top nid.

In case this task is part of a group that is interleaved over
multiple nodes, task_numa_migrate will set the task's preferred
nid to the best node it could find for the task, so this patch
will cause at most one run through task_numa_migrate.
