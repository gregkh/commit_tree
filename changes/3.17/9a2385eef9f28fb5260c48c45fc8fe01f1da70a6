mm: memcontrol: remove ordering between pc->mem_cgroup and PageCgroupUsed

There is a write barrier between setting pc->mem_cgroup and
PageCgroupUsed, which was added to allow LRU operations to lookup the
memcg LRU list of a page without acquiring the page_cgroup lock.

But ever since commit 38c5d72f3ebe ("memcg: simplify LRU handling by new
rule"), pages are ensured to be off-LRU while charging, so nobody else
is changing LRU state while pc->mem_cgroup is being written, and there
are no read barriers anymore.

Remove the unnecessary write barrier.
