tipc: clean up connection protocol reception function

We simplify the code for receiving connection probes, leveraging the
recently introduced tipc_msg_reverse() function. We also stick to
the principle of sending a possible response message directly from
the calling (tipc_sk_rcv or backlog_rcv) functions, hence making
the call chain shallower and easier to follow.

We make one small protocol change here, allowed according to
the spec. If a protocol message arrives from a remote socket that
is not the one we are connected to, we are currently generating a
connection abort message and send it to the source. This behavior
is unnecessary, and might even be a security risk, so instead we
now choose to only ignore the message. The consequnce for the sender
is that he will need longer time to discover his mistake (until the
next timeout), but this is an extreme corner case, and may happen
anyway under other circumstances, so we deem this change acceptable.
