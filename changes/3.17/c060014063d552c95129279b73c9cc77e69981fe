spi: davinci: use spi_device.cs_gpio to store gpio cs per spi device

Rework Davinci SPI driver to store GPIO CS number in cs_gpio field
of SPI device structure (spi_device) for both DT and non-DT cases.
This will make Davinci SPI driver code simpler and allows to reuse
more SPI core functionality.
