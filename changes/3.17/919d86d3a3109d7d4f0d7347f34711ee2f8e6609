perf session: Flag if the event stream is entirely in memory

Flag if the event stream is a file that has been mmapped in one go.

This is useful, for example, if a tool needs to keep an event for later
reference.  If the new flag is set, a pointer to the event can be
retained, otherwise the event must be copied.
