ASoC: samsung: Add I2C dependency for snow

Both codecs used by snow, max98090 and max98095 require the use
of I2C, so we can only select this driver if I2C is there, otherwise
we get a build error like:

codecs/max98090.c:2494:1: warning: data definition has no type or storage class [enabled by default]
 module_i2c_driver(max98090_i2c_driver);
 ^
codecs/max98095.c:2443:1: warning: data definition has no type or storage class [enabled by default]
 module_i2c_driver(max98095_i2c_driver);
 ^

This adds one more I2C dependency to the hundreds we already
have.
