arch/sparc/math-emu/math_32.c: drop stray break operator

This commit is a guesswork, but it seems to make sense to drop this
break, as otherwise the following line is never executed and becomes
dead code. And that following line actually saves the result of
local calculation by the pointer given in function argument. So the
proposed change makes sense if this code in the whole makes sense (but I
am unable to analyze it in the whole).
