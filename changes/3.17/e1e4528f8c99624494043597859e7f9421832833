hwspinlock/omap: enable module before reading SYSSTATUS register

The number of hwspinlocks are determined based on the value read
from the IP block's SYSSTATUS register. However, the module may
not be enabled and clocked, and the read may result in a bus error.

This particular issue is seen rather easily on AM33XX, since the
module wakeup is software controlled, and it is disabled out of
reset. Make sure the module is enabled and clocked before reading
the SYSSTATUS register.
