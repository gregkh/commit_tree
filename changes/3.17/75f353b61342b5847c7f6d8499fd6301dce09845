of/platform: Fix of_platform_device_destroy iteration of devices

of_platform_destroy does not work properly, since the tree
population test was iterating on all devices having as its parent
the given platform device.

The check was intended to check whether any other platform or amba
devices created by of_platform_populate were still populated, but
instead checked for every kind of device. This is wrong, since platform
devices typically create a subsystem regular device and set themselves
as parents.

Instead, go ahead and call the unregister functions for any devices
created with of_platform_populate. The driver core will take care of
unbinding drivers, and drivers are responsible for getting rid of any
child devices that weren't created by of_platform_populate.
