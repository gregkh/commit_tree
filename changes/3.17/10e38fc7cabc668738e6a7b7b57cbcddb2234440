KVM: x86: Emulator flag for instruction that only support 16-bit addresses in real mode

Certain instructions, such as monitor and xsave do not support big real mode
and cause a #GP exception if any of the accessed bytes effective address are
not within [0, 0xffff].  This patch introduces a flag to mark these
instructions, including the necassary checks.
