workqueue: stronger test in process_one_work()

After the recent changes, when POOL_DISASSOCIATED is cleared, the
running worker's local CPU should be the same as pool->cpu without any
exception even during cpu-hotplug.  Update the sanity check in
process_one_work() accordingly.

This patch changes "(proposition_A && proposition_B && proposition_C)"
to "(proposition_B && proposition_C)", so if the old compound
proposition is true, the new one must be true too. so this will not
hide any possible bug which can be caught by the old test.

tj: Minor updates to the description.
