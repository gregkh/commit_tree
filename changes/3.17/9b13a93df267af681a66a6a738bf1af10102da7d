x86, cpufeature: Convert more "features" to bugs

X86_FEATURE_FXSAVE_LEAK, X86_FEATURE_11AP and
X86_FEATURE_CLFLUSH_MONITOR are not really features but synthetic bits
we use for applying different bug workarounds. Call them what they
really are, and make sure they get the proper cross-CPU behavior (OR
rather than AND).
