tipc: make tipc_buf_append() more robust

As per comment from David Miller, we try to make the buffer reassembly
function more resilient to user errors than it is today.

- We check that the "*buf" parameter always is set, since this is
  mandatory input.

- We ensure that *buf->next always is set to NULL before linking in
  the buffer, instead of relying of the caller to have done this.

- We ensure that the "tail" pointer in the head buffer's control
  block is initialized to NULL when the first fragment arrives.
