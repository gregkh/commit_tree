drm/exynos: control blending of mixer graphic layer 0

The mixer graphic layer 0 isn't blended as default by commit
0377f4ed9f1aed30292c4e3c87f24e028ae26f36(drm/exynos: Don't blend mixer
layer 0). But it needs to be blended with graphic layer 0 if video layer
is enabled by vp because video layer is bottom.
