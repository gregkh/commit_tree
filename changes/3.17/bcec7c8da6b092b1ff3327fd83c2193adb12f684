MIPS: asm/reg.h: Make 32- and 64-bit definitions available at the same time

Get rid of the WANT_COMPAT_REG_H test and instead define both the 32-
and 64-bit register offset definitions at the same time with
MIPS{32,64}_ prefixes, then define the existing EF_* names to the
correct definitions for the kernel's bitness.

This patch is a prerequisite of the following bug fix patch.
