vfio-pci: Attempt bus/slot reset on release

Each time a device is released, mark whether a local reset was
successful or whether a bus/slot reset is needed.  If a reset is
needed and all of the affected devices are bound to vfio-pci and
unused, allow the reset.  This is most useful when the userspace
driver is killed and releases all the devices in an unclean state,
such as when a QEMU VM quits.
