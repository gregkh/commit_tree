workqueue: clear POOL_DISASSOCIATED in rebind_workers()

The commit a9ab775bcadf ("workqueue: directly restore CPU affinity of
workers from CPU_ONLINE") moved the pool->lock into rebind_workers()
without also moving "pool->flags &= ~POOL_DISASSOCIATED".

There is nothing wrong with "pool->flags &= ~POOL_DISASSOCIATED" not
being moved together, but there isn't any benefit either. We move it
into rebind_workers() and achieve these benefits:

1) Better readability.  POOL_DISASSOCIATED is cleared in
   rebind_workers() as expected.

2) When POOL_DISASSOCIATED is cleared, we can ensure that all the
   running workers of the pool are on the local CPU (pool->cpu).

tj: Cosmetic updates to the code and description.
