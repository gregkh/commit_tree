clk: flatten clk tree in debugfs

This patch flattens the clk tree in CCF debugfs. Instead of representing the
clocks and their hierarchy as a directory structure under
/sys/kernel/debug/clk, each clock gets a single directory directly under
/sys/kernel/debug/clk. The orphans directory is replaced by a file called
clk_orphan_summary.
