workqueue: remove the misnamed out_unlock label in get_unbound_pool()

After the locking was moved up to the caller of the get_unbound_pool(),
out_unlock label doesn't need to do any unlock operation and the name
became bad, so we just remove this label, and the only usage-site
"goto out_unlock" is subsituted to "return pool".
