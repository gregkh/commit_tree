spi/rockchip: Avoid accidentally turning off the clock

If our client is requesting a clock that is above the maximum clock
then the following division will result in 0:
  rs->max_freq / rs->speed

We'll then program 0 into the SPI_BAUDR register.  The Rockchip TRM
says: "If the value is 0, the serial output clock (sclk_out) is
disabled."

It's much better to end up with the fastest possible clock rather than
a clock that is off, so enforce a minimum value.
