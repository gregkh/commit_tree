ath10k: prevent endless pci rx loop

It was possible to enter an endless loop while
processing a single pci copy engine pipe. This
could effectively render ath10k incapable of
responding to any requests.

An example case when this could happen is when
firmware generates a lot of events, e.g. spectral
scan phyerr via WMI.
