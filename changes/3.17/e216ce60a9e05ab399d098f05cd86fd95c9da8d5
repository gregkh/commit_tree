clk: qcom: Add support for APQ8064 multimedia clocks

The APQ8064 multimedia clock controller is fairly similar to the
8960 multimedia clock controller, except that gfx2d0/1 has been
removed and the gfx3d frequency is slightly faster when using the
newly introduced PLL15. We also add vcap clocks and a couple new
TV clocks.
