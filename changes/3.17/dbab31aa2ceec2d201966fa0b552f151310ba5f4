mm: softdirty: keep bit when zapping file pte

This fixes the same bug as b43790eedd31 ("mm: softdirty: don't forget to
save file map softdiry bit on unmap") and 9aed8614af5a ("mm/memory.c:
don't forget to set softdirty on file mapped fault") where the return
value of pte_*mksoft_dirty was being ignored.

To be sure that no other pte/pmd "mk" function return values were being
ignored, I annotated the functions in arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable.h
with __must_check and rebuilt.

The userspace effect of this bug is that the softdirty mark might be
lost if a file mapped pte get zapped.
