KVM: s390/mm: Fix guest storage key corruption in ptep_set_access_flags

commit 0944fe3f4a32 ("s390/mm: implement software referenced bits")
triggered another paging/storage key corruption. There is an
unhandled invalid->valid pte change where we have to set the real
storage key from the pgste.
When doing paging a guest page might be swapcache or swap and when
faulted in it might be read-only and due to a parallel scan old.
An do_wp_page will make it writeable and young. Due to software
reference tracking this page was invalid and now becomes valid.
