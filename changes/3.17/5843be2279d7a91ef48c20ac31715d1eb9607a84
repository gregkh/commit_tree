arm64: Remove unused variable in head.S

Remove an unused local variable from head.S.  It seems this was never
used even from the initial commit
9703d9d7f77ce129621f7d80a844822e2daa7008 (arm64: Kernel booting and
initialisation), and is a left over from a previous implementation
of __calc_phys_offset.
