powerpc/powernv: Fix IOMMU group lost

When we take full hotplug to recover from EEH errors, PCI buses
could be involved. For the case, the child devices of involved
PCI buses can't be attached to IOMMU group properly, which is
caused by commit 3f28c5a ("powerpc/powernv: Reduce multi-hit of
iommu_add_device()").

When adding the PCI devices of the newly created PCI buses to
the system, the IOMMU group is expected to be added in (C).
(A) fails to bind the IOMMU group because bus->is_added is
false. (B) fails because the device doesn't have binding IOMMU
table yet. bus->is_added is set to true at end of (C) and
pdev->is_added is set to true at (D).

         pci_bus_add_devices()
            pci_bus_add_device()                    D: Add device

If the parent PCI bus isn't involved in hotplug, the IOMMU
group is expected to be bound in (B). (A) should fail as the
sysfs entries aren't populated.

The patch fixes the issue by reverting commit 3f28c5a and remove
WARN_ON() in iommu_add_device() to allow calling the function
even the specified device already has associated IOMMU group.
