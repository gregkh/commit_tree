mm, writeback: prevent race when calculating dirty limits

Setting vm_dirty_bytes and dirty_background_bytes is not protected by
any serialization.

Therefore, it's possible for either variable to change value after the
test in global_dirty_limits() to determine whether available_memory
needs to be initialized or not.

Always ensure that available_memory is properly initialized.
