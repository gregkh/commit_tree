i40e: remove support for vf unicast promiscuous mode

Remove the ability of a VF to set unicast promiscuous mode.
Considered to be a security risk to allow VFs to receive traffic
intended for other VFs so don't allow it, simply ignore the flag.

Also fix it to send the correct seid to aq for multicast promiscuous set.
