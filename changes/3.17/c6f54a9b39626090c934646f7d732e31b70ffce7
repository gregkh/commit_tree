ARM: 8113/1: remove remaining definitions of PLAT_PHYS_OFFSET from <mach/memory.h>

The platforms selecting NEED_MACH_MEMORY_H defined the start address of
their physical memory in the respective <mach/memory.h>. With
ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT=y (which is quite common today) this is useless
though because the definition isn't used but determined dynamically.

So remove the definitions from all <mach/memory.h> and provide the
Kconfig symbol PHYS_OFFSET with the respective defaults in case
ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT isn't enabled.

This allows to drop the dependency of PHYS_OFFSET on !NEED_MACH_MEMORY_H
which prevents compiling an integrator nommu-kernel.
(CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET which has "default PHYS_OFFSET if !MMU" expanded to
"0x" because CONFIG_PHYS_OFFSET doesn't exist as INTEGRATOR selects
NEED_MACH_MEMORY_H.)
