inet: frag: don't account number of fragment queues

The 'nqueues' counter is protected by the lru list lock,
once thats removed this needs to be converted to atomic
counter.  Given this isn't used for anything except for
reporting it to userspace via /proc, just remove it.

We still report the memory currently used by fragment
reassembly queues.
