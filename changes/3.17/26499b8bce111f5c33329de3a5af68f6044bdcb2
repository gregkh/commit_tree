staging: comedi: s626: remove 'reset_cap_flags' callback from encoder private data

There are two functions used for the 'reset_cap_flags' callback, One is used for
the channel 0-2 encoders and the other for the channel 3-5 encoders.

Refactor the two callbacks into a single s626_reset_cap_flags() function and use
the encoder channel number to handle the differences.

Remove the then unnecessary 'reset_cap_flags' member and just call s626_reset_cap_flags()
directly.
