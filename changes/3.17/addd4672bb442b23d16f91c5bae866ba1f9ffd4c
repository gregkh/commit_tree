tty: Document locking for tty_port_open()

The tty lock is held when the tty driver's open method is called
(from the lone call-site, tty_open()). The call-tree audit [1] of
tty_port_open() is a closed graph of the callers of tty_port_open();
ie., all callers originate from only tty_open().

Of these callers, none drop the tty lock.

Also, document that tty_port_block_til_ready() may drop and reacquire
the tty lock when blocking, which means the tty or tty_port may have
changed state.
