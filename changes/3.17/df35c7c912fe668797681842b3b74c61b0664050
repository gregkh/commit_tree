Block: fix unbalanced bypass-disable in blk_register_queue

When a queue is registered, the block layer turns off the bypass
setting (because bypass is enabled when the queue is created).  This
doesn't work well for queues that are unregistered and then registered
again; we get a WARNING because of the unbalanced calls to
blk_queue_bypass_end().

This patch fixes the problem by making blk_register_queue() call
blk_queue_bypass_end() only the first time the queue is registered.
