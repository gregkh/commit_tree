ixgbe: fix use of list_for_each in ixgbe_enumerate_functions

Fix a bug in the misuse of the list_for_each macro to loop over every
entry in the bus_list. Instead of attempting to loop over the list from
a random entry point, go up to the bus and use the real list_head entry
point. This prevents the possible read or write of unallocated or
incorrectly addressed memory.
