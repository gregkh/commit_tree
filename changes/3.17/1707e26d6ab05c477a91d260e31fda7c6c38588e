Btrfs: fill_holes: Fix slot number passed to hole_mergeable() call.

For a non-existent key, btrfs_search_slot() sets path->slots[0] to the slot
where the key could have been present, which in this case would be the slot
containing the extent item which would be the next neighbor of the file range
being punched. The current code passes an incremented path->slots[0] and we
skip to the wrong file extent item. This would mean that we would fail to
merge the "yet to be created" hole with the next neighboring hole (if one
exists). Fix this.
