PM / tools: analyze_suspend.py: update to v3.0

Update of analyze_suspend.py to v3.0

New features include back-2-back suspend testing, device filters to
reduce the html size, the inclusion of device_prepare and device_complete
callbacks, a usb topography list, and the ability to control USB
device autosuspend.

UI upgrades include a device detail window and mini-timeline, the addition
of a suspend_prepare and resume_complete phase to the timeline which includes
the associated device callbacks, automatic highlight of related callbacks,
and general color and name changes for better reability.

The new version relies on two trace point patches that are already in
the kernel:
        enable_trace_events_suspend_resume.patch
        enable_trace_events_device_pm_callback.patch

It has legacy support for older kernels without these trace events, but
when available the tool processes the ftrace output alone (dmesg has
been deprecated as a tool input, and is only gathered for convenience).
