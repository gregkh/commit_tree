KVM: PPC: PR: Handle FSCR feature deselects

We handle FSCR feature bits (well, TAR only really today) lazily when the guest
starts using them. So when a guest activates the bit and later uses that feature
we enable it for real in hardware.

However, when the guest stops using that bit we don't stop setting it in
hardware. That means we can potentially lose a trap that the guest expects to
happen because it thinks a feature is not active.

This patch adds support to drop TAR when then guest turns it off in FSCR. While
at it it also restricts FSCR access to 64bit systems - 32bit ones don't have it.
