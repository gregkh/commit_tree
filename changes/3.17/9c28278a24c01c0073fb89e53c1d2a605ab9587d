percpu: reorder macros in percpu header files

* In include/asm-generic/percpu.h, collect {raw|_this}_cpu_generic*()
  macros into one place.  They were dispersed through
  {raw|this}_cpu_*_N() definitions and the visiual inconsistency was
  making following the code unnecessarily difficult.

* In include/linux/percpu-defs.h, move __verify_pcpu_ptr() later in
  the file so that it's right above accessor definitions where it's
  actually used.

This is pure reorganization.
