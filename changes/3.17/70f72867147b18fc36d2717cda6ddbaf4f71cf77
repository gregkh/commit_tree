staging: comedi: ni_labpc: use the comedi_device 'mmio' member

Use the new 'mmio' member in the comedi_device for the ioremap'ed
base address.

Only the ni_labpc_pci module does the ioremap, its also the only
module that sets the 'has_mmio' member in the boardinfo. Remove
this member from the boardinfo and use dev->mmio to determine if
the I/O is memory mapped.
