net: mvneta: Fix reference counting for phy_node

If there is a "phy" handle the probe function returns with holding a
reference to that node. Make sure that in the fixed phy case there is
also held a reference to yield a consistant state.

Also add the corresponding of_node_put in the error path and the remove
function.
