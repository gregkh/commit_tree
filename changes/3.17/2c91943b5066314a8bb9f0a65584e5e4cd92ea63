btrfs: Return right extent when fiemap gives unaligned offset and len.

When page aligned start and len passed to extent_fiemap(), the result is
good, but when start and len is not aligned, e.g. start = 1 and len =
4095 is passed to extent_fiemap(), it returns no extent.

The problem is that start and len is all rounded down which causes the
problem. This patch will round down start and round up (start + len) to
return right extent.
