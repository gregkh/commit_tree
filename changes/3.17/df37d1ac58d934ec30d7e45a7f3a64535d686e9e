skein_iv.h:39:11: warning: symbol 'SKEIN_256_IV_224' was not declared. Should it be static?
skein_iv.h:47:11: warning: symbol 'SKEIN_256_IV_256' was not declared. Should it be static?

skein_iv.h:167:11: warning: symbol 'SKEIN_1024_IV_1024' was not declared. Should it be static?

by declaring the initialization vectors in question as static.  The header
skein_iv.h is only included by skein.c
