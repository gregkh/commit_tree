workqueue: remove an unneeded UNBOUND test before waking up the next worker

In process_one_work():

	if ((worker->flags & WORKER_UNBOUND) && need_more_worker(pool))
		wake_up_worker(pool);

the first test is unneeded.  Even if the first test is removed, it
doesn't affect the wake-up logic for WORKER_UNBOUND, and it will not
introduce any useless wake-ups for normal per-cpu workers since
nr_running is always >= 1.  It will introduce useless/redundant
wake-ups for CPU_INTENSIVE, but this case is rare and the next patch
will also remove this redundant wake-up.
