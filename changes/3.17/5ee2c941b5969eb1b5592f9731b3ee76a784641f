tcp: Remove unnecessary arg from tcp_enter_cwr and tcp_init_cwnd_reduction

Since Yuchung's 9b44190dc11 (tcp: refactor F-RTO), tcp_enter_cwr is always
called with set_ssthresh = 1. Thus, we can remove this argument from
tcp_enter_cwr. Further, as we remove this one, tcp_init_cwnd_reduction
is then always called with set_ssthresh = true, and so we can get rid of
this argument as well.
