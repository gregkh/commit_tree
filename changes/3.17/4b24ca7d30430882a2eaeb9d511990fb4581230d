nfsd: Allow struct nfsd4_compound_state to cache the nfs4_client

We want to use the nfsd4_compound_state to cache the nfs4_client in
order to optimise away extra lookups of the clid.

In the v4.0 case, we use this to ensure that we only have to look up the
client at most once per compound for each call into lookup_clientid. For
v4.1+ we set the pointer in the cstate during SEQUENCE processing so we
should never need to do a search for it.
