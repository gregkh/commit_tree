irqchip: versatile-fpga: add support for arm,versatile-sic

The secondary controller on ARM Versatile AB and PB is similar to
other ARM platforms, but has a pass-thru register to connect some
interrupts directly to interrupt inputs on the primary interrupt
controller. The PIC_ENABLES register needs to be configured for
proper operation when the matching node is arm,versatile-sic. Add the
the necessary IRQCHIP_DECLARE as well.
