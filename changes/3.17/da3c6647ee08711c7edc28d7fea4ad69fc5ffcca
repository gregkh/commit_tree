I2C/ACPI: Clean up I2C ACPI code and Add CONFIG_I2C_ACPI config

Clean up ACPI related code in the i2c core and add CONFIG_I2C_ACPI
to enable I2C ACPI code.

Current there is a race between removing I2C ACPI operation region
and ACPI AML code accessing. So make i2c core built-in if CONFIG_I2C_ACPI
is set.
