net/phy: micrel: Disable asymmetric pause for KSZ9031

The KSZ9031 appears to suffer from the same hardware bug as described
for the KSZ9021 in commit 32fcafbcd1c9f6c7013016a22a5369b4acb93577
("net/phy: micrel: Disable asymmetric pause for KSZ9021")
you have to unplug the cable and plug it back to get it to work.

Remove the SUPPORTED_Asym_Pause flag for the KSZ9031 to fix this.
