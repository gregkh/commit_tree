cpufreq: intel_pstate: Disable interrupts during MSRs reading

According to Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures SDM, Volume 3,
Chapter 14.2, "Software needs to exercise care to avoid delays
between the two RDMSRs (for example interrupts)".

So, disable interrupts during reading MSRs IA32_APERF and IA32_MPERF.
This should increase the accuracy of the calculations.
