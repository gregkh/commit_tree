i2c: rk3x: fix divisor calculation for SCL frequency

I2C_CLKDIV register descripted in the previous version of
RK3x chip manual is incorrect. Plus 1 is required.

The correct formula:
- T(SCL_HIGH) = T(PCLK) * (CLKDIVH + 1) * 8
- T(SCL_LOW) = T(PCLK) * (CLKDIVL + 1) * 8
- (SCL Divsor) = 8 * ((CLKDIVL + 1) + (CLKDIVH + 1))
- SCL = PCLK / (CLK Divsor)

It will be updated to the latest version of chip manual.
