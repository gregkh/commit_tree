perf machine: Fix map groups of threads with unknown pids

Events like sched_switch do not provide a pid (tgid) which can result in
threads with an unknown pid.  If the pid is later discovered, join the
map groups.

Note the thread's map groups should be empty because they are populated
by MMAP events which do provide the pid and tid.
