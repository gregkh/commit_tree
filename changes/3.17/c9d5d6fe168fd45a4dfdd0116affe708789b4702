spi: dw-pci: fix bug when regs left uninitialized

The commit 04f421e7 "spi: dw: use managed resources" changes drivers to use
managed functions, but seems wasn't properly tested in PCI case. The regs field
of struct dw_spi left uninitialized. Thus, kernel crashes when tries to access
to the SPI controller registers. This patch fixes the issue.
