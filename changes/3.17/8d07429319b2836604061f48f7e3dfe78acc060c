mm: vmscan: remove remains of kswapd-managed zone->all_unreclaimable

shrink_zones() has a special branch to skip the all_unreclaimable()
check during hibernation, because a frozen kswapd can't mark a zone
unreclaimable.

But ever since commit 6e543d5780e3 ("mm: vmscan: fix
do_try_to_free_pages() livelock"), determining a zone to be
unreclaimable is done by directly looking at its scan history and no
longer relies on kswapd setting the per-zone flag.

Remove this branch and let shrink_zones() check the reclaimability of
the target zones regardless of hibernation state.
