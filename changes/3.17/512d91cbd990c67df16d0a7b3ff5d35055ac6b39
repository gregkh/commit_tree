ARM: OMAP2+: clock/dpll: convert bypass check to use clk_features

OMAP2 DPLL code for checking whether DPLL is in bypass mode now uses
clk_features data provided during boot. This avoids the need to use
cpu_is_X type checks runtime, and allows us to eventually move the
clock code under the clock driver.
