xtensa: don't allow overflow/underflow on unaligned stack

Double exceptions that happen during register window overflow/underflow
are handled in the topmost stack frame, as if it was the only exception
that occured. However unaligned access exception handler is special
because it needs to analyze instruction that caused the exception, but
the userspace instruction that triggered window exception is completely
irrelevant. Unaligned data access is rather normal in the generic
userspace code, but stack pointer manipulation must always be done by
architecture-aware code and thus unaligned stack means a serious problem
anyway.
Use the default unaligned access handler that raises SIGBUS in case
of unaligned access in window overflow/underflow handler.
