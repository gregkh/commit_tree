advansys: don't build ARM

The advansys SCSI driver uses the dma_cache_sync function, which is
not available on the ARM architecture, and cannot be implemented
correctly, so we always get this build error:

drivers/scsi/advansys.c: In function 'advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma':
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:7882:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'dma_cache_sync' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  dma_cache_sync(board->dev, scp->sense_buffer,
  ^

It seems nobody has missed this driver so far, so let's just
disable it for ARM to help randconfig builds.
