mac80211: use chanctx reservation for AP CSA

Channel switch finalization is now 2-step. First
step is when driver calls csa_finish(), the other
is when reservation is actually finalized (which
can be deferred for in-place reservation).

It is now safe to call ieee80211_csa_finish() more
than once.
