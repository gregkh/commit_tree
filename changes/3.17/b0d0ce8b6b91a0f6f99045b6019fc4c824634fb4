spi: sh-msiof: Add DMA support

Add DMA support to the MSIOF driver using platform data.

As MSIOF DMA is limited to 32-bit words (requiring byte/wordswapping for
smaller wordsizes), and the group length is limited to 256 words, DMA is
performed on two fixed pages, allocated and mapped at driver initialization
time.

Performance figures (in Mbps) on r8a7791/koelsch at different SPI clock
frequencies for 1024-byte and 4096-byte transfers:

                   1024 bytes           4096 bytes
  -  3.25 MHz: PIO  2.1, DMA  2.6 | PIO  2.8, DMA  3.1
  -  6.5  MHz: PIO  3.2, DMA  4.4 | PIO  5.0, DMA  5.9
  - 13    MHz: PIO  4.2, DMA  6.6 | PIO  8.2, DMA 10.7
  - 26    MHz: PIO  5.9, DMA 10.4 | PIO 12.4, DMA 18.4

Note that DMA is only faster than PIO for transfers that exceed the FIFO
size (typically 64 words / 256 bytes).

Also note that large transfers (larger than the group length for DMA, or
larger than the FIFO size for PIO), should use cs-gpio (with the
appropriate pinmux setup), as the hardware chipselect will be deasserted in
between chunks.
