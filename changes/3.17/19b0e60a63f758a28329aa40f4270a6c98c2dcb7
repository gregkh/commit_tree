ARM: KVM: handle 64bit values passed to mrcc or from mcrr instructions in BE case

In some cases the mcrr and mrrc instructions in combination with the ldrd
and strd instructions need to deal with 64bit value in memory. The ldrd
and strd instructions already handle endianness within word (register)
boundaries but to get effect of the whole 64bit value represented correctly,
rr_lo_hi macro is introduced and is used to swap registers positions when
the mcrr and mrrc instructions are used. That has the effect of swapping
two words.
