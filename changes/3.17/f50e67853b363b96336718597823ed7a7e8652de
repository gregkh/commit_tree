usb: musb/cppi41: call musb_ep_select() before accessing an endpoint's CSR

Before accessing any of an endpoint's CSR registers, make sure the
correct endpoint is selected. Otherwise, data read from or written to
the registers is likely to affect the wrong endpoint as long as the
connected device has more than one endpoint.

This, of course, leads to all sorts of strange effects such as stream
starvation and driver internal state machine confusion due to spurious
interrupts.
