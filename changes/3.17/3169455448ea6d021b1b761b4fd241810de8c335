ARM: mvebu: remove stub implementation of CPU hotplug on Armada 375/38x

In preparation to the addition of CPU hotplug support for Armada XP,
and therefore moving the existing stub functions for hotplug support,
this commit removes the reference from the SMP implementation of
Armada 375/38x to the armada_xp_cpu_die() function. Proper CPU hotplug
support for Armada 375 and 38x will be implemented at a later point.
