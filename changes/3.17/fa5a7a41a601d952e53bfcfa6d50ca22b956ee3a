fs/qnx6: update debugging to current functions

Add DDEBUG in Makefile when CONFIG_QNX6FS_DEBUG is set.  All QNX6DEBUG
messages are replaced by pr_debug which means debugging will be emitted in
debug level only and no more in error and info levels.  debug uses now
pr_fmt and __func__

QNX6DEBUG definition has been removed.
