pinctrl: baytrail: Warn if direct IRQ GPIO set to output

For Baytrail, you should never set a GPIO set to direct_irq
to output mode.  When direct_irq_en is set for a GPIO, it is
tied directly to an APIC internally, and making the pad output
does not make any sense. Assert a WARN() in the event this happens.
