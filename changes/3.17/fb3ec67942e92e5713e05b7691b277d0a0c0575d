KVM: arm64: GICv3: mandate page-aligned GICV region

Just like GICv2 was fixed in 63afbe7a0ac1
(kvm: arm64: vgic: fix hyp panic with 64k pages on juno platform),
mandate the GICV region to be both aligned on a page boundary and
its size to be a multiple of page size.

This prevents a guest from being able to poke at regions where we
have no idea what is sitting there.
