PCI: Remove "no hotplug settings from platform" warning

We print way too many messages like this:

    pci 0000:00:00.0: no hotplug settings from platform
    pci 0000:00:00.0: using default PCI settings

This usually happens when the platform doesn't supply an ACPI _HPP method,
but the method is optional, so there's no point in warning about it.

Not only are the messages useless, but we call pci_configure_slot() far too
many times, so they're repeated many times.  I'll fix the overuse of
pci_configure_slot() too, but that will wait until the next merge window.

For now, just remove both log messages.
