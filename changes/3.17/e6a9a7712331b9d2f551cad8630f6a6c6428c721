workqueue: remove the empty check in too_many_workers()

The commit ea1abd6197d5 ("workqueue: reimplement idle worker rebinding")
used a trick which simply removes all to-be-bound idle workers from the
idle list and lets them add themselves back after completing rebinding.

And this trick caused the @worker_pool->nr_idle may deviate than the actual
number of idle workers on @worker_pool->idle_list.  More specifically,
nr_idle may be non-zero while ->idle_list is empty.  All users of
->nr_idle and ->idle_list are audited.  The only affected one is
too_many_workers() which is updated to check %false if ->idle_list is
empty regardless of ->nr_idle.

The commit/trick was complicated due to it just tried to simplify an even
more complicated problem (workers had to rebind itself). But the commit
a9ab775bcadf ("workqueue: directly restore CPU affinity of workers
from CPU_ONLINE") fixed all these problems and the mentioned trick was
useless and is gone.

So, now the @worker_pool->nr_idle is exactly the actual number of workers
on @worker_pool->idle_list. too_many_workers() should recover as it was
before the trick. So we remove the empty check.
