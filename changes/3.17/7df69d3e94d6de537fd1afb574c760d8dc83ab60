Btrfs: Fix wrong device size when we are resizing the device

total_bytes of device is just a in-memory variant which is used to record
the size of the device, and it might be changed before we resize a device,
if the resize operation fails, it will be fallbacked. But some code used it
to update on-disk metadata of the device, it would cause the problem that
on-disk metadata of the devices was not consistent. We should use the other
variant named disk_total_bytes to update the on-disk metadata of device,
because that variant is updated only when the resize operation is successful.
Fix it.
