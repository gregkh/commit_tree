powerpc/powernv: Enable M64 aperatus for PHB3

This patch enables M64 aperatus for PHB3.

We already had platform hook (ppc_md.pcibios_window_alignment) to affect
the PCI resource assignment done in PCI core so that each PE's M32 resource
was built on basis of M32 segment size. Similarly, we're using that for
M64 assignment on basis of M64 segment size.

   * We're using last M64 BAR to cover M64 aperatus, and it's shared by all
     256 PEs.
   * We don't support P7IOC yet. However, some function callbacks are added
     to (struct pnv_phb) so that we can reuse them on P7IOC in future.
   * PE, corresponding to PCI bus with large M64 BAR device attached, might
     span multiple M64 segments. We introduce "compound" PE to cover the case.
     The compound PE is a list of PEs and the master PE is used as before.
     The slave PEs are just for MMIO isolation.
