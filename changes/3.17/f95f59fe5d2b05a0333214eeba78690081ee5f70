mwifiex: remove redundant TDLS setup action frame check and avoid leaks

The unwanted frame types are already handled in 'default' case
of the switch/case below.
The str_ptr is allocated but it can be leaked if the length check
fails in the REQUEST/RESP cases. Fix it by allocating sta_ptr
after the length checks.
