clk: qcom: Add support for IPQ8064's global clock controller (GCC)

Add a driver for the global clock controller found on IPQ8064 based
platforms. This should allow most non-multimedia device drivers to probe
and control their clocks.

This is currently missing clocks for USB HSIC and networking devices.
