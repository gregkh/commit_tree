net: remove deprecated syststamp timestamp

The SO_TIMESTAMPING API defines three types of timestamps: software,
hardware in raw format (hwtstamp) and hardware converted to system
format (syststamp). The last has been deprecated in favor of combining
hwtstamp with a PTP clock driver. There are no active users in the
kernel.

The option was device driver dependent. If set, but without hardware
support, the correct behavior is to return zero in the relevant field
in the SCM_TIMESTAMPING ancillary message. Without device drivers
implementing the option, this field is effectively always zero.

Remove the internal plumbing to dissuage new drivers from implementing
the feature. Keep the SOF_TIMESTAMPING_SYS_HARDWARE flag, however, to
avoid breaking existing applications that request the timestamp.
