arm64: adjust el0_sync so that a function can be called

To implement the context tracker properly on arm64,
a function call needs to be made after debugging and
interrupts are turned on, but before the lr is changed
to point to ret_to_user(). If the function call
is made after the lr is changed the function will not
return to the correct place.

For similar reasons, defer the setting of x0 so that
it doesn't need to be saved around the function call
(save far_el1 in x26 temporarily instead).
