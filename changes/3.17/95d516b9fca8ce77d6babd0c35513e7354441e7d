ARM: dts: ODROID i2c improvements

Increase max i2c bus frequency beyond the default for faster
data transfers. According to the manual, these faster speeds are
only available when the board is wired up the right way. In this case,
the vendor kernel has run at this speed for a long time.

sda-delay is needed for talking to RTC on PMIC, otherwise the i2c
controller never sees an ACK. Strangely the other PMIC i2c slave (the
main one) works fine even without this delay. I Chose value 100 to
match the vendor kernel.
