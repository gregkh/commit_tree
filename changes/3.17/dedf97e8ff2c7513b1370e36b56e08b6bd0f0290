arm64: KVM: fix 64bit CP15 VM access for 32bit guests

Commit f0a3eaff71b8 (ARM64: KVM: fix big endian issue in
access_vm_reg for 32bit guest) changed the way we handle CP15
VM accesses, so that all 64bit accesses are done via vcpu_sys_reg.

This looks like a good idea as it solves indianness issues in an
elegant way, except for one small detail: the register index is
doesn't refer to the same array! We end up corrupting some random
data structure instead.

Fix this by reverting to the original code, except for the introduction
of a vcpu_cp15_64_high macro that deals with the endianness thing.

Tested on Juno with 32bit SMP guests.
