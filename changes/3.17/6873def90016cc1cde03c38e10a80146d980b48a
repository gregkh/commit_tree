selftests/powerpc: Move core_busy_loop() into asm

There is at least one bug in core_busy_loop(), we use r0, but it's
not in the clobber list. We were getting away with this it seems but
that was luck.

It's also fishy to be touching the stack, even if we do it below the
stack pointer. It seems we get away with it, but looking at the
generated code that may just be luck.

So move it into assembler, do all the stack handling by hand. We create
a stack frame to save the non-volatiles in, so we can muck around with
them.
