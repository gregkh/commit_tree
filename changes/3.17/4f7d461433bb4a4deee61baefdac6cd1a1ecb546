fork: copy mm's vm usage counters under mmap_sem

If a forking process has a thread calling (un)mmap (silly but still),
the child process may have some of its mm's vm usage counters (total_vm
and friends) screwed up, because currently they are copied from oldmm
w/o holding any locks (memcpy in dup_mm).

This patch moves the counters initialization to dup_mmap() to be called
under oldmm->mmap_sem, which eliminates any possibility of race.
