cgroup: distinguish the default and legacy hierarchies when handling cftypes

Until now, cftype arrays carried files for both the default and legacy
hierarchies and the files which needed to be used on only one of them
were flagged with either CFTYPE_ONLY_ON_DFL or CFTYPE_INSANE.  This
gets confusing very quickly and we may end up exposing interface files
to the default hierarchy without thinking it through.

This patch makes cgroup core provide separate sets of interfaces for
cftype handling so that the cftypes for the default and legacy
hierarchies are clearly distinguished.  The previous two patches
renamed the existing ones so that they clearly indicate that they're
for the legacy hierarchies.  This patch adds the interface for the
default hierarchy and apply them selectively depending on the
hierarchy type.

* cftypes added through cgroup_subsys->dfl_cftypes and
  cgroup_add_dfl_cftypes() only show up on the default hierarchy.

* cftypes added through cgroup_subsys->legacy_cftypes and
  cgroup_add_legacy_cftypes() only show up on the legacy hierarchies.

* cgroup_subsys->dfl_cftypes and ->legacy_cftypes can point to the
  same array for the cases where the interface files are identical on
  both types of hierarchies.

* This makes all the existing subsystem interface files legacy-only by
  default and all subsystems will have no interface file created when
  enabled on the default hierarchy.  Each subsystem should explicitly
  review and compose the interface for the default hierarchy.

* A boot param "cgroup__DEVEL__legacy_files_on_dfl" is added which
  makes subsystems which haven't decided the interface files for the
  default hierarchy to present the legacy files on the default
  hierarchy so that its behavior on the default hierarchy can be
  tested.  As the awkward name suggests, this is for development only.

* memcg's CFTYPE_INSANE on "use_hierarchy" is noop now as the whole
  array isn't used on the default hierarchy.  The flag is removed.

v2: Updated documentation for cgroup__DEVEL__legacy_files_on_dfl.

v3: Clear CFTYPE_ONLY_ON_DFL and CFTYPE_INSANE when cfts are removed
    as suggested by Li.
