KVM: check for !is_zero_pfn() in kvm_is_mmio_pfn()

Read-only memory ranges may be backed by the zero page, so avoid
misidentifying it a a MMIO pfn.

This fixes another issue I identified when testing QEMU+KVM_UEFI, where
a read to an uninitialized emulated NOR flash brought in the zero page,
but mapped as a read-write device region, because kvm_is_mmio_pfn()
misidentifies it as a MMIO pfn due to its PG_reserved bit being set.
