mfd: ab8500-debugfs: Simplify invalid debugfs data checking

Noticed during a coding review, if we reorganised the checking a
little, we can rid the code of a pointless 'else'.  Whilst looking
for this particular code hunk I noticed another pointless 'else',
which I've subsequently fixed in this patch.
