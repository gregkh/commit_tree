tty: Document locking for tty_port_block_til_ready()

The tty lock is held when the tty driver's open() method is called
(from tty_open()). The call-tree audit [1] of tty_port_block_til_ready()
is a closed graph of the callers of tty_port_block_til_ready();
ie., all callers originate only from tty_open().

Of these callers, none drop the tty lock.

Also, document tty_port_block_til_ready() may drop and reacquire
the tty lock when blocking, which means the tty or tty_port may have
changed state.

[1]
Call-tree audit of tty_port_block_til_ready()
* does not include call tree of tty_port_open() which is already
  documented in 'tty: Document locking from tty_port_open()'
