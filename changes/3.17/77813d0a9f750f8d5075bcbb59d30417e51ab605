i40e/i40evf: ARQ copy desc data even for failed commands

Copy desc and buffer data even for ARQ events which return error status.
Previously, a check for NVM related AQ commands which is done later in this
function would not recognize that such a command was received and would
not clear nvm_busy flag. This would block access to NVM until a driver reset.
This will fix that.
