sparc: bpf_jit: fix support for ldx/stx mem and SKF_AD_VLAN_TAG

fix several issues in sparc BPF JIT compiler.

ldx/stx related:
. classic BPF instructions that access mem[] slots were not setting
  SEEN_MEM flag, so stack wasn't allocated. Fix that by advertising
  correct flags

. LDX/STX instructions were missing SEEN_XREG, so register value
  could have leaked to user space. Fix it.

. since stack for mem[] slots is allocated with 'sub %sp' instead
  of 'save %sp', use %sp as base register instead of %fp.

. ldx mem[0] means first slot in classic BPF which should have
  -4 offset instead of 0.

. sparc64 needs 2047 stack bias as per ABI to access stack

. emit_stmem() was using LD32I macro instead of ST32I

SKF_AD_VLAN_TAG* related:
. SKF_AD_VLAN_TAG_PRESENT must return 1 or 0 instead of '> 0' or 0
  as per classic BPF de facto standard

. SKF_AD_VLAN_TAG needs to mask the field correctly
