cgroup: reorganize cgroup_subtree_control_write()

Make the following two reorganizations to
cgroup_subtree_control_write().  These are to prepare for future
changes and shouldn't cause any functional difference.

* Move availability above css offlining wait.

* Move cgrp->child_subsys_mask update above new css creation.
