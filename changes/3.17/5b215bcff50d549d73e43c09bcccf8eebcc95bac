drm/i915: lock around link status and link training.

We need to take the connection mutex around the link status
check for non-MST case, but also around the MST link training
on short HPDs.

I suspect we actually should have a dpcd lock in the future as
well, that just lock the local copies of dpcd and flags stored
from that.
