staging: comedi: ni_atmio: remove ATMIO and PCIMIO defines

These defines were probably intended to be used so that ni_mio_common.c
could detect if it was included by a driver that uses ioport or memory
mapped register access. This can actually be detected by checking if
the 'mite' member in the private data has been allocated.

Regardless, the symbols are not used. Just remove them.
