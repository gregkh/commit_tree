Kbuild: Add a option to enable dwarf4 v2

I found that a lot of unresolvable variables when using gdb on the
kernel become resolvable when dwarf4 is enabled. So add a Kconfig flag
to enable it.

It definitely increases the debug information size, but on the other
hand this isn't so bad when debug fusion is used.
