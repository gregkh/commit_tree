cxgb4: Replaced the backdoor mechanism to access the HW memory with PCIe Window method

Rip out a bunch of redundant PCI-E Memory Window Read/Write routines,
collapse the more general purpose routines into a single routine
thereby eliminating the need for a large stack frame (and extra data
copying) in the outer routine, change everything to use the improved
routine t4_memory_rw.
