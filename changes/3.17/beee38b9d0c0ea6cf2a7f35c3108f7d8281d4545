KVM: ARM: vgic: abstract VMCR access

Instead of directly messing with with the GICH_VMCR bits for the CPU
interface save/restore code, add accessors that encode/decode the
entire set of registers exposed by VMCR.

Not the most efficient thing, but given that this code is only used
by the save/restore code, performance is far from being critical.
