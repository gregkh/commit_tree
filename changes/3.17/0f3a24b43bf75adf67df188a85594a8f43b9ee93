nfsd: Ensure that nfsd_create_setattr commits files to stable storage

Since nfsd_create_setattr strips the mode from the struct iattr, it
is quite possible that it will optimise away the call to nfsd_setattr
altogether.
If this is the case, then we never call commit_metadata() on the
newly created file.

Also ensure that both nfsd_setattr() and nfsd_create_setattr() fail
when the call to commit_metadata fails.
