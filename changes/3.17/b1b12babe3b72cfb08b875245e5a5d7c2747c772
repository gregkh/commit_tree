cpufreq: update 'cpufreq_suspended' after stopping governors

Commit 8e30444e1530 ("cpufreq: fix cpufreq suspend/resume for intel_pstate")
introduced a bug where the governors wouldn't be stopped anymore for
->target{_index}() drivers during suspend. This happens because
'cpufreq_suspended' is updated before stopping the governors during suspend
and due to this __cpufreq_governor() would return early due to this check:

	/* Don't start any governor operations if we are entering suspend */
	if (cpufreq_suspended)
		return 0;
