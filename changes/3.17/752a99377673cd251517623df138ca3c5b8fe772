ARM: mvebu: use a local variable to store the resume address

The resume address used by the cpuidle code will not always be the
same depending on the SoC. Using a local variable to store the resume
address allows to keep the same function for the PM notifier but with
a different address. This address will be set during the
initialization of the cpuidle logic in pmsu.c.
