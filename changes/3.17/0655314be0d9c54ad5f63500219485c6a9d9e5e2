usb: dwc2/gadget: fix phy disable sequence

When the driver is removed s3c_hsotg_phy_disable is called three times
instead of once. This results in decreasing of the phy reference counter
below zero and thus consecutive inserts of the module fails.

This patch removes calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from s3c_hsotg_remove
and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop.

s3c_hsotg_udc_stop is called from udc-core.c only after
usb_gadget_disconnect, which in turn calls s3c_hsotg_pullup, which
already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable.

s3c_hsotg_remove must be called only after udc_stop, so there is no
point in disabling phy once again there.
