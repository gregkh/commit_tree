drbd: improve throttling decisions of background resynchronisation

Background resynchronisation does some "side-stepping", or throttles
itself, if it detects application IO activity, and the current resync
rate estimate is above the configured "cmin-rate".

What was not detected: if there is no application IO,
because it blocks on activity log transactions.

Introduce a new atomic_t ap_actlog_cnt, tracking such blocked requests,
and count non-zero as application IO activity.
This counter is exposed at proc_details level 2 and above.

Also make sure to release the currently locked resync extent
if we side-step due to such voluntary throttling.
