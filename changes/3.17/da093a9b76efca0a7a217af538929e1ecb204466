dcache: d_splice_alias should ignore DCACHE_DISCONNECTED

Any IS_ROOT() alias should be safe to use; there's nothing special about
DCACHE_DISCONNECTED dentries.

Note that this is in fact useful for filesystems such as btrfs which can
legimately encounter a directory with a preexisting IS_ROOT alias on a
lookup that crosses into a subvolume.  (Those aliases are currently
marked DCACHE_DISCONNECTED--but not really for any good reason, and
we'll change that soon.)
