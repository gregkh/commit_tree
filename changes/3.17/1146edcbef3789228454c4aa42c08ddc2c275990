rcu: Loosen __call_rcu()'s rcu_head alignment constraint

The m68k architecture aligns only to 16-bit boundaries, which can cause
the align-to-32-bits check in __call_rcu() to trigger.  Because there is
currently no known potential need for more than one low-order bit, this
commit loosens the check to 16-bit boundaries.
