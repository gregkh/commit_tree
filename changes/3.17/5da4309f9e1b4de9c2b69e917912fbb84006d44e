i2c: rk3x: fix bug that cause transfer fails in master receive mode

In rk3x SOC, the I2C controller can receive/transmit up to 32 bytes data
in one chunk, so the size of data to be write/read to/from TXDATAx/RXDATAx
must be less than or equal 32 bytes at a time.

Tested on rk3288-pinky board, elan receive 158 bytes data.
