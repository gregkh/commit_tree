staging: comedi: comedidev.h: introduce some 'range_is_external' helpers

The comedi_krange includes a flags member that currently identifies the
'units' of the range (RF_UNIT) and if the range is from an internal or
external source (RF_EXTERNAL).

Introduce some helper functions to check if a given range is from an
external source.
