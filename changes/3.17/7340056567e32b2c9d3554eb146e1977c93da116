powerpc/pci: Reorder pci bus/bridge unregistration during PHB removal

Commit bcdde7e made __sysfs_remove_dir() recursive and introduced a BUG_ON
during PHB removal while attempting to delete the power managment attribute
group of the bus. This is a result of tearing the bridge and bus devices down
out of order in remove_phb_dynamic. Since, the the bus resides below the bridge
in the sysfs device tree it should be torn down first.

This patch simply moves the device_unregister call for the PHB bridge device
after the device_unregister call for the PHB bus.
