KVM: x86: Emulator support for #UD on CPL>0

Certain instructions (e.g., mwait and monitor) cause a #UD exception when they
are executed in user mode. This is in contrast to the regular privileged
instructions which cause #GP. In order not to mess with SVM interception of
mwait and monitor which assumes privilege level assertions take place before
interception, a flag has been added.
