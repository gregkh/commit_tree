x86/mm: Clean up the TLB flushing code

The

	if (cpumask_any_but(mm_cpumask(mm), smp_processor_id()) < nr_cpu_ids)

line of code is not exactly the easiest to audit, especially when
it ends up at two different indentation levels.  This eliminates
one of the the copy-n-paste versions.  It also gives us a unified
exit point for each path through this function.  We need this in
a minute for our tracepoint.
