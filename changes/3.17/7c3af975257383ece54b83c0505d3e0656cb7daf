nfs: don't sleep with inode lock in lock_and_join_requests

This handles the 'nonblock=false' case in nfs_lock_and_join_requests.
If the group is already locked and blocking is allowed, drop the inode lock
and wait for the group lock to be cleared before trying it all again.
This should fix warnings found in peterz's tree (sched/wait branch), where
might_sleep() checks are added to wait.[ch].
