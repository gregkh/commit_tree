PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp probe

pciehp assumes that dev->subordinate exists.  But we do not assign a bus if
we run out of bus numbers during enumeration.  This leads to a NULL
dereference in init_slot() (and other places).

Change pciehp_probe() to return -ENODEV when no subordinate bus is present.
