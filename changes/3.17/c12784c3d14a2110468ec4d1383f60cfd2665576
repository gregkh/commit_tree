xen/events/fifo: reset control block and local HEADs on resume

When using the FIFO-based event channel ABI, if the control block or
the local HEADs are not reset after resuming the guest may see stale
HEAD values and will fail to traverse the FIFO correctly.

This may prevent one or more VCPUs from receiving any events following
a resume.
