net: fec: clean up duplex mode handling

Many places call fec_restart() with the second parameter being some kind
of previously saved duplex value, but only two places call it with some
other setting.  This is at odds with how the other link settings are
handled, and used to be racy before the rtnl locks were added to
fec_restart()'s various call paths.

Clean this up so all link capabilities are handled in the same way -
saved into the fec_enet_private structure, and then fec_restart() acts
on those settings.
