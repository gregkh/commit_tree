timekeeping: Convert timekeeping core to use timespec64s

Convert the core timekeeping logic to use timespec64s. This moves the
2038 issues out of the core logic and into all of the accessor
functions.

Future changes will need to push the timespec64s out to all
timekeeping users, but that can be done interface by interface.
