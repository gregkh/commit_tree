thunderbolt: Add initial cactus ridge NHI support

Thunderbolt hotplug is supposed to be handled by the firmware. But Apple
decided to implement thunderbolt at the operating system level. The
firmare only initializes thunderbolt devices that are present at boot
time. This driver enables hotplug of thunderbolt of non-chained
thunderbolt devices on Apple systems with a cactus ridge controller.

This first patch adds the Kconfig file as well the parts of the driver
which talk directly to the hardware (that is pci device setup, interrupt
handling and RX/TX ring management).
