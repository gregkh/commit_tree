memory: Freescale CoreNet Coherency Fabric error reporting driver

The CoreNet Coherency Fabric is part of the memory subsystem on
some Freescale QorIQ chips.  It can report coherency violations (e.g.
due to misusing memory that is mapped noncoherent) as well as
transactions that do not hit any local access window, or which hit a
local access window with an invalid target ID.
