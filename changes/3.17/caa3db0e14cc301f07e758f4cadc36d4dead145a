drbd: Remove unnecessary/unused code

Get rid of dump_stack() debug statements.

There is no point whatsoever in registering and unregistering a reboot
notifier that doesn't do anything.

The intention was to switch to an "emergency read-only" mode,
so we won't have to resync the full activity log just because
we had been Primary before the reboot.

Once we have that implemented, we may re-introduce the reboot notifier.
