MIPS: tlbex: Fix a missing statement for HUGETLB

In commit 2c8c53e28f1 (MIPS: Optimize TLB handlers for Octeon CPUs)
build_r4000_tlb_refill_handler() is modified. But it doesn't compatible
with the original code in HUGETLB case. Because there is a copy & paste
error and one line of code is missing. It is very easy to produce a bug
with LTP's hugemmap05 test.
