drm/tilcdc: tfp410: fix dangling sysfs connector node

Add a drm_sysfs_connector_remove call when we destroy the panel to make
sure the connector node in sysfs gets deleted.

This is required for proper unload and re-load of this driver, otherwise
we will get a warning about a duplicate filename in sysfs.
