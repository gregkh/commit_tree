drm/i915: Clean up WRPLL/SPLL #defines

Luckily the bit definitions match, but it's still confusing
to use one when handling the other. So sprinkle some OCD over
the #defines to make them match and use the right version in
each place.

Maybe we should unify these definitions completely, but that
can always be done sometime in the future.
