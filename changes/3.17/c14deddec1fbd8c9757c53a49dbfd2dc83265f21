mtd: spi-nor: add support for flag status register on Micron chips

Some new Micron flash chips require reading the flag status register to
determine when operations have completed.

Furthermore, chips with multi-die stacks of the 65nm 256Mb QSPI also
require reading the status register before reading the flag status
register.

This patch adds support for the flag status register in the n25q512ax3
and n25q00 Micron QSPI flash chips.
