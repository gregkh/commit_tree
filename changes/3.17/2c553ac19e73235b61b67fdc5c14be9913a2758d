ARM: 8164/1: mm: clear SCTLR.HA instead of setting it for LPAE

SCTLR.HA (hardware access flag) is deprecated and not actually
implemented by any CPUs. Furthermore, it can confuse cr_alignment checks
where the whole value of SCTLR is compared against the value sitting in
the hardware, since the bit is actually RAZ/WI and will not match the
saved cr_alignment value.
