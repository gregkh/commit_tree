blk-mq: blk_mq_freeze_queue() should allow nesting

While converting to percpu_ref for freezing, add703fda981 ("blk-mq:
use percpu_ref for mq usage count") incorrectly made
blk_mq_freeze_queue() misbehave when freezing is nested due to
percpu_ref_kill() being invoked on an already killed ref.

Fix it by making blk_mq_freeze_queue() kill and kick the queue only
for the outermost freeze attempt.  All the nested ones can simply wait
for the ref to reach zero.

While at it, remove unnecessary @wake initialization from
blk_mq_unfreeze_queue().
