Btrfs: don't consider the missing device when allocating new chunks

The original code allocated new chunks by the number of the writable devices
and missing devices to make sure that any RAID levels on a degraded FS continue
to be honored, but it introduced a problem that it stopped us to allocating
new chunks, the steps to reproduce is following:

 # mkfs.btrfs -m raid1 -d raid1 -f <dev0> <dev1>
 # mkfs.btrfs -f <dev1>			//Removing <dev1> from the original fs
 # mount -o degraded <dev0> <mnt>
 # dd if=/dev/null of=<mnt>/tmpfile bs=1M

It is because we allocate new chunks only on the writable devices, if we take
the number of missing devices into account, and want to allocate new chunks
with higher RAID level, we will fail becaue we don't have enough writable
device. Fix it by ignoring the number of missing devices when allocating
new chunks.
