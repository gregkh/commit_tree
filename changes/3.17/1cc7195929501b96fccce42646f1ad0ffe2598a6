ASoC: rsnd: care audio local bus data format consistency

R-Car sound uses Audio Local Bus which uses Lch/Rch format.
This bus is used if driver uses BUSIF.
But sound data is written as Rch/Lch format in register.
This means Rch <-> Lch will be inverted.
SSIU :: BUSIF_DALIGN is used to controlling data format.
