xfs: ensure verifiers are attached to recovered buffers

Crash testing of CRC enabled filesystems has resulted in a number of
reports of bad CRCs being detected after the filesystem was mounted.
Errors such as the following were being seen:

XFS (sdb3): Mounting V5 Filesystem
XFS (sdb3): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)
XFS (sdb3): Metadata CRC error detected at xfs_agf_read_verify+0x5a/0x100 [xfs], block 0x1
XFS (sdb3): Unmount and run xfs_repair
XFS (sdb3): First 64 bytes of corrupted metadata buffer:

XFS (sdb3): metadata I/O error: block 0x1 ("xfs_trans_read_buf_map") error 74 numblks 1

The errors were typically being seen in AGF, AGI and their related
btree block buffers some time after log recovery had run. Often it
wasn't until later subsequent mounts that the problem was
discovered. The common symptom was a buffer with the correct
contents, but a CRC and an LSN that matched an older version of the
contents.

Some debug added to _xfs_buf_ioapply() indicated that buffers were
being written without verifiers attached to them from log recovery,
and Jan Kara isolated the cause to log recovery readahead an dit's
interactions with buffers that had a more recent LSN on disk than
the transaction being recovered. In this case, the buffer did not
get a verifier attached, and os when the second phase of log
recovery ran and recovered EFIs and unlinked inodes, the buffers
were modified and written without the verifier running. Hence they
had up to date contents, but stale LSNs and CRCs.

Fix it by attaching verifiers to buffers we skip due to future LSN
values so they don't escape into the buffer cache without the
correct verifier attached.

This patch is based on analysis and a patch from Jan Kara.
