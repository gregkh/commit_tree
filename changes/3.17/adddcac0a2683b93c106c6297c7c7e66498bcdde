mtd: lpc32xx: drop bitflip_threshold initialization

These drivers don't need to explicitly initialize their bitflip
thresholds. The comment is no longer correct, since nand_scan_tail()
performs this initialization as of the following commit:

        mtd: nand: initialize bitflip_threshold prior to BBT scanning

(It seems there were some parallel efforts on writing/submitting these
drivers, and Shmulik's bug fix.)
