powerpc: Remove misleading DISABLE_INTS

DISABLE_INTS has a long and storied history, but for some time now it
has not actually disabled interrupts.

For the open-coded exception handlers, just stop using it, instead call
RECONCILE_IRQ_STATE directly. This has the benefit of removing a level
of indirection, and making it clear that r10 & r11 are used at that
point.

For the addition case we still need a macro, so rename it to clarify
what it actually does.
