nfs: disallow duplicate pages in pgio page vectors

Adjacent requests that share the same page are allowed, but should only
use one entry in the page vector. This avoids overruning the page
vector - it is sized based on how many bytes there are, not by
request count.

This fixes issues that manifest as "Redzone overwritten" bugs (the
vector overrun) and hangs waiting on page read / write, as it waits on
the same page more than once.

This also adds bounds checking to the page vector with a graceful failure
(WARN_ON_ONCE and pgio error returned to application).
