tools: selftests - create a separate hotplug target for full range test

On some systems, hot-plug tests could hang forever waiting for cpu and
memory to be ready to be offlined. A special hot-plug target is created
to run full range of hot-plug tests. In default mode, hot-plug tests run
in safe mode with a limited scope. In limited mode, cpu-hotplug test is
run on a single cpu as opposed to all hotplug capable cpus, and memory
hotplug test is run on 2% of hotplug capable memory instead of 10%. In
addition to the above change, cpu-hotplug is chnged to change processor
affinity to cpu 0 so it doesn't impact itself while the test runs.
