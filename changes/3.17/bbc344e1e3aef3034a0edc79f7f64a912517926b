percpu: introduce arch_raw_cpu_ptr()

Currently, archs can override raw_cpu_ptr() directly; however, we
wanna build a layer of indirection in the generic part of percpu so
that we can implement generic features there without affecting archs.

Introduce arch_raw_cpu_ptr() which is used to define raw_cpu_ptr() by
generic percpu code.  The two are identical for now.  x86 is currently
the only arch which overrides raw_cpu_ptr() and is converted to
define arch_raw_cpu_ptr() instead.

This doesn't introduce any functional difference.
