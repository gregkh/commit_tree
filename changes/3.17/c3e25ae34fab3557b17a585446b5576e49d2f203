drm: fix uninitialized acquire_ctx fields (v2)

The acquire ctx will typically be declared on the stack, which means we
could have garbage values for any uninitialized field.  In this case, it
was triggering WARN_ON()s because 'contended' had garbage value.

Go ahead and use memset() to be more future-proof.

v2: now with extra brown paper bag
