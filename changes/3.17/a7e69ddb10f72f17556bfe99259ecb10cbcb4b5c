USB: storage: add quirk for Newer Technology uSCSI SCSI-USB converter

The uSCSI from Newer Technology is a SCSI-USB converter with USB ID 06ca:2003.
Like several other SCSI-USB products, it's a Shuttle Technology OEM device.
Without a suitable entry in unusual-devs.h, the converter can only access the
(single) device with SCSI ID 0. Copying the entry for device 04e6:0002 allows
it to work with devices with other SCSI IDs too.

There are currently six entries for Shuttle-developed SCSI-USB devices in
unusual-devs.h (grep for euscsi):
  04e6:0002  Shuttle eUSCSI Bridge    USB_SC_DEVICE, USB_PR_DEVICE
  04e6:000b  Shuttle eUSCSI Bridge    USB_SC_SCSI, USB_PR_BULK
  04e6:000c  Shuttle eUSCSI Bridge    USB_SC_SCSI, USB_PR_BULK
  050d:0115  Belkin USB SCSI Adaptor  USB_SC_SCSI, USB_PR_BULK
  07af:0004  Microtech USB-SCSI-DB25  USB_SC_DEVICE, USB_PR_DEVICE
  07af:0005  Microtech USB-SCSI-HD50  USB_SC_DEVICE, USB_PR_DEVICE

lsusb -v output for the uSCSI lists
  bInterfaceSubClass      6 SCSI
  bInterfaceProtocol     80 Bulk (Zip)

This patch adds an entry for the uSCSI to unusual_devs.h.
