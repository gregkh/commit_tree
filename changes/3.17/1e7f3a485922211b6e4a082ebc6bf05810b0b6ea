nfs: move nfs_pgio_data and remove nfs_rw_header

nfs_rw_header was used to allocate an nfs_pgio_header along with an
nfs_pgio_data, because a _header would need at least one _data.

Now there is only ever one nfs_pgio_data for each nfs_pgio_header -- move
it to nfs_pgio_header and get rid of nfs_rw_header.
