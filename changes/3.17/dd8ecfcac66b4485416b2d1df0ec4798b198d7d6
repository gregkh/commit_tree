dmaengine: dw: don't perform DMA when dmaengine_submit is called

Accordingly to discussion [1] and followed up documentation the DMA controller
driver shouldn't start any DMA operations when dmaengine_submit() is called.

This patch fixes the workflow in dw_dmac driver to follow the documentation.
