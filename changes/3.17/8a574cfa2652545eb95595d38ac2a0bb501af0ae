MIPS: mcount: Adjust stack pointer for static trace in MIPS32

Every mcount() call in the MIPS 32-bit kernel is done as follows:

[...]
move at, ra
jal _mcount
addiu sp, sp, -8
[...]

but upon returning from the mcount() function, the stack pointer
is not adjusted properly. This is explained in details in 58b69401c797
(MIPS: Function tracer: Fix broken function tracing).

Commit ad8c396936e3 ("MIPS: Unbreak function tracer for 64-bit kernel.)
fixed the stack manipulation for 64-bit but it didn't fix it completely
for MIPS32.
