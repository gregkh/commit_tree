sd: don't use scsi_setup_blk_pc_cmnd for flush requests

Simplify handling of flush requests by setting up the command directly
instead of initializing request fields and then calling
scsi_setup_blk_pc_cmnd to propagate the information into the command.

Also rename scsi_setup_flush_cmnd to sd_setup_flush_cmnd for consistency.
