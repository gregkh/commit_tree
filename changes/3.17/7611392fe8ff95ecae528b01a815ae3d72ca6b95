Input: add INPUT_PROP_POINTING_STICK property

It is useful for userspace to know that there not dealing with a regular
mouse but rather with a pointing stick (e.g. a trackpoint) so that
userspace can e.g. automatically enable middle button scrollwheel
emulation.

It is impossible to tell the difference from the evdev info without
resorting to putting a list of device / driver names in userspace, this is
undesirable.

Add a property which allows userspace to see if a device is a pointing
stick, and set it on all the pointing stick drivers.
