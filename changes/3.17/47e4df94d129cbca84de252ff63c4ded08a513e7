mac80211: fix channel switch for chanctx-based drivers

The new_ctx pointer is set only for non-chanctx drivers.  This yielded a
crash for chanctx-based drivers during channel switch finalization:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020
  IP: ieee80211_vif_use_reserved_switch+0x71c/0xb00 [mac80211]

Use an adequate chanctx pointer to fix this.
