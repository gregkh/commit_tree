nfsd: declare v4.1+ openowners confirmed on creation

There's no need to confirm an openowner in v4.1 and above, so we can
go ahead and set NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED when we create openowners in
those versions. This will also be necessary when we remove the
client_mutex, as it'll be possible for two concurrent opens to race
in versions >4.0.
