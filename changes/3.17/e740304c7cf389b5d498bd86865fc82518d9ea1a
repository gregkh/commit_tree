ACPICA: Utilities: Add support to read table from files

After the new table reading utility functions are well tested, acpidump can
also switch to use the generic acpi_ut_read_table_xxx() APIs. Currently
this patch is no-op as acpidump does not link to the new APIs.

This patch is only useful for ACPICA applications, most of which are not
shipped in the Linux kernel.
