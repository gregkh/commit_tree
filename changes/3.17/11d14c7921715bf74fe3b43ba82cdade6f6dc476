b43: N-PHY: fix "Data bus error" while working in 5 GHz

When switching from one 5 GHz channel to another 5 GHz channel we need
to make sure BPHY is still in a reset. However to access BPHY register
we have to switch to 2 GHz mode for a moment. Otherwise this may result
in "Data bus error" (noticed by Hauke with BCM43224 connected to the
SoC).
