ASoC: core: Add initial support for DAI multicodec

DAI link assumes a one to one mapping between CPU DAI and CODEC. In
some cases, the same CPU DAI can be connected to several codecs.
This is the case for example, if you connect two mono codecs to the
same I2S link in order to have a stereo card.
The current ASoC implementation does not allow such setup.

Add support for DAI links composed of a single CPU DAI and multiple
CODECs. Sound cards have to pass the CODECs array in the corresponding
DAI link through a new 'snd_soc_dai_link_component' struct. Each CODEC in
this array is described in the same manner single CODEC DAIs are
(either DT/OF node or codec_name).

Multi-codec links are not supported in the case of CODEC to CODEC links.
Just print a warning if it happens.

Based on an original code done by Misael.
