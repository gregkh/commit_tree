blk-mq: Avoid race condition with uninitialized requests

This patch should fix the bug reported in
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/11/249.

We have to initialize at least the atomic_flags and the cmd_flags when
allocating storage for the requests.

Otherwise blk_mq_timeout_check() might dereference uninitialized
pointers when racing with the creation of a request.

Also move the reset of cmd_flags for the initializing code to the point
where a request is freed. So we will never end up with pending flush
request indicators that might trigger dereferences of invalid pointers
in blk_mq_timeout_check().
