arm/arm64: KVM: Fix unaligned access bug on gicv2 access

We were using an atomic bitop on the vgic_v2.vgic_elrsr field which was
not aligned to the natural size on 64-bit platforms.  This bug showed up
after QEMU correctly identifies the pl011 line as being level-triggered,
and not edge-triggered.

These data structures are protected by a spinlock so simply use a
non-atomic version of the accessor instead.
