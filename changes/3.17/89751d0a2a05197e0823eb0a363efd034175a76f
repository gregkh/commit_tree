dmaengine: qcom_bam_dma: Add descriptor flags

This patch adds support for end of transaction (EOT) and notify when done (NWD)
hardware descriptor flags.

The EOT flag requests that the peripheral assert an end of transaction interrupt
when that descriptor is complete.  It also results in special signaling protocol
that is used between the attached peripheral and the core using the DMA
controller.  Clients will specify DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT to enable this flag.

The NWD flag requests that the peripheral wait until the data has been fully
processed by the peripheral before moving on to the next descriptor.  Clients
will specify DMA_PREP_FENCE to enable this flag.
