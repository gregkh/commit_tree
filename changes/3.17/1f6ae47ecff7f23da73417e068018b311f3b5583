PCI: Configure ASPM when enabling device

We can't do ASPM configuration at enumeration-time because enabling it
makes some defective hardware unresponsive, even if ASPM is disabled later
(see 41cd766b0659 ("PCI: Don't enable aspm before drivers have had a chance
to veto it").  Therefore, we have to do it after a driver claims the
device.

We previously configured ASPM in pci_set_power_state(), but that's not a
very good place because it's not really related to setting the PCI device
power state, and doing it there means:

  - We incorrectly skipped ASPM config when setting a device that's
    already in D0 to D0.

  - We unnecessarily configured ASPM when setting a device to a low-power
    state (the ASPM feature only applies when the device is in D0).

  - We unnecessarily configured ASPM when called from a .resume() method
    (ASPM configuration needs to be restored during resume, but
    pci_restore_pcie_state() should already do this).

Move ASPM configuration from pci_set_power_state() to
do_pci_enable_device() so we do it when a driver enables a device.
