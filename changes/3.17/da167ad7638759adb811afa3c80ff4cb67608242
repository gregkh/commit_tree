rtc: ia64: allow other architectures to use EFI RTC

Currently, the rtc-efi driver is restricted to ia64 only.  Newer
architectures with EFI support may want to also use that driver.  This
patch moves the platform device setup from ia64 into drivers/rtc and
allow any architecture with CONFIG_EFI=y to use the rtc-efi driver.
