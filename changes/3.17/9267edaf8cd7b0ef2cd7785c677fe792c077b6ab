usb: musb: cppi41: fix not transmitting zero length packet issue

CPPI TX does not transmit ZLP for TX transfers which
- transfer size is multiple of EP packet size,
- and URB_ZERO_PACKET is set in urb->transfer_flags.

The fix is transmitting the ZLP using PIO mode after the CPPI TX is
done.

Validated using the following usbtest write case in MUSB host mode.

  # testusb -t1 -c1
