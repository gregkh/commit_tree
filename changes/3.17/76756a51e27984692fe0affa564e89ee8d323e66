rbd: use rbd_obj_watch_request_helper() helper

Switch rbd_dev_header_{un,}watch_sync() to use the new helper and fix
rbd_dev_header_unwatch_sync() to destroy watch_request structures
before queuing watch-remove message while at it.  This mistake slipped
into commit b30a01f2a307 ("rbd: fix osd_request memory leak in
__rbd_dev_header_watch_sync()") and could lead to "image still in use"
errors on image removal.
