crypto: drbg - use of kernel linked list

The DRBG-style linked list to manage input data that is fed into the
cipher invocations is replaced with the kernel linked list
implementation.

The change is transparent to users of the interfaces offered by the
DRBG. Therefore, no changes to the testmgr code is needed.
