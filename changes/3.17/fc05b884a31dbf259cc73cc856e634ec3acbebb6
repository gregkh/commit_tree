can: flexcan: correctly initialize mailboxes

Apparently mailboxes may contain random data at startup, causing some of them
being prepared for message reception. This causes overruns being missed or even
confusing the IRQ check for trasmitted messages, increasing the transmit
counter instead of the error counter.

This patch initializes all mailboxes after the FIFO as RX_INACTIVE.
