android: convert sync to fence api, v6

Just to show it's easy.

Android syncpoints can be mapped to a timeline. This removes the need
to maintain a separate api for synchronization. I've left the android
trace events in place, but the core fence events should already be
sufficient for debugging.

v2:
- Call fence_remove_callback in sync_fence_free if not all fences have fired.
v3:
- Merge Colin Cross' bugfixes, and the android fence merge optimization.
v4:
- Merge with the upstream fixes.
v5:
- Fix small style issues pointed out by Thomas Hellstrom.
v6:
- Fix for updates to fence api.
