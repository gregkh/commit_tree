ARM: sun8i: Add reset controller nodes to the DTSI

The A23 has the same MMIO reset controllers matching the clocks gates,
just like in the A31. This patch adds the reset controller nodes and
the reset control phandles for the peripherals needing them to the
DTSI.

Unlike the sun6i DTSI, this patch uses sun6i-a31-clock-reset for
ahb1_rst. sun6i-a31-ahb-reset is for early init, and requires some
additions to the machine code. It is used to support the hstimer.
However the hstimer on sun8i only has 1 timer, which is somewhat
useless. Support for it will probably not be added. Hence the
decision to use sun6i-a31-clock-reset here to avoid the changes to
sun8i machine code.
