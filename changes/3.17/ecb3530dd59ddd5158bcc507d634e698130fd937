clocksource: Add support for the Mediatek SoCs

This patch adds a clock source and clock event for the timer found
on the Mediatek SoCs.

The Mediatek General Purpose Timer block provides five 32 bit timers and
one 64 bit timer.

Two 32 bit timers are used by this driver:
TIMER1: clock events supporting periodic and oneshot events
TIMER2: clock source configured as a free running counter

The General Purpose Timer block can be run with two clocks. A 13 MHz system
clock and the RTC clock running at 32 KHz. This implementation uses the system
clock with no clock source divider.

The interrupts are shared between the different timers and have to be read back
from a register. We just enable one interrupt for the clock event. The clock
event timer is used by all cores.
