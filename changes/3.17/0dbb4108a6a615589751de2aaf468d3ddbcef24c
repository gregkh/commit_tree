xprtrdma: Unclutter struct rpcrdma_mr_seg

Clean ups:
 - make it obvious that the rl_mw field is a pointer -- allocated
   separately, not as part of struct rpcrdma_mr_seg
 - promote "struct {} frmr;" to a named type
 - promote the state enum to a named type
 - name the MW state field the same way other fields in
   rpcrdma_mw are named
