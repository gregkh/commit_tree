staging: vt6655: fixed sparse warnings

This commit fixes a few sparse warnings for missing the 'static' keyword
in array definitions:
    drivers/staging//vt6655/rxtx.c:81:22: warning: symbol 'wTimeStampOff' was not declared. Should it be static?
    drivers/staging//vt6655/rxtx.c:86:22: warning: symbol 'wFB_Opt0' was not declared. Should it be static?
    drivers/staging//vt6655/rxtx.c:90:22: warning: symbol 'wFB_Opt1' was not declared. Should it be static?
