powerpc/thp: Invalidate old 64K based hash page mapping before insert of 4k pte

If we changed base page size of the segment, either via sub_page_protect
or via remap_4k_pfn, we do a demote_segment which doesn't flush the hash
table entries. We do a lazy hash page table flush for all mapped pages
in the demoted segment. This happens when we handle hash page fault
for these pages.

We use _PAGE_COMBO bit along with _PAGE_HASHPTE to indicate whether a
pte is backed by 4K hash pte. If we find _PAGE_COMBO not set on the pte,
that implies that we could possibly have older 64K hash pte entries in
the hash page table and we need to invalidate those entries.

Handle this correctly for 16M pages
