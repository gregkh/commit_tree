MIPS: Remove race window in page fault handling

Multicore MIPSes without I/D hardware coherency suffered from a race
condition in the page fault handler. The page table entry was
published before any pending lazy D-cache flush was committed, hence
it allowed execution of stale page cache data by other VPEs in the
system.

To make the cache handling safe we need to perform flushing already in
the set_pte_at function. MIPSes without coherent I-caches can get a
small increase in flushes due to the unavailability of the execute
flag in set_pte_at.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: outlining set_pte_at() saves a good k in a test
build, so I moved its definition from pgtable.h to cache.c.]
