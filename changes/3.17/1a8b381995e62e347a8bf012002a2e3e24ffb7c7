[media] coda: fix decoder I/P/B frame detection

Currently the rotator unit is used to copy decoded frames out into buffers
provided by videobuf2. Since the CODA reports the I/P/B frame type of the
last decoded frame, and this frame will be copied out in a later device_run,
depending on display order, we have to store the frame type until such time.
This patch also adds the B-frame type.
