vfs: workaround gcc <4.6 build error in link_path_walk()

Commit d6bb3e9075bb ("vfs: simplify and shrink stack frame of
link_path_walk()") introduced build problems with GCC versions older
than 4.6 due to the initialisation of a member of an anonymous union in
struct qstr without enclosing braces.

This hits GCC bug 10676 [1] (which was fixed in GCC 4.6 by [2]), and
causes the following build error:

  fs/namei.c: In function 'link_path_walk':
  fs/namei.c:1778: error: unknown field 'hash_len' specified in initializer

This is worked around by adding explicit braces.
