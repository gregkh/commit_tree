tracing: Change trace event sample to use strlcpy instead of strncpy

Strings should be copied with strlcpy instead of strncpy when they will
later be printed via %s. This guarantees that they terminate with a
NUL '\0' character and do not run pass the end of the allocated string.

This is only for sample code, but it should stil represent a good
role model.
