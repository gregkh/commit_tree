net/mlx4: Correctly configure single ported VFs from the host

Single port VFs are seen PCI wise on both ports of the PF (we don't have
single port PFs with ConnectX). With this in mind, it's possible for
virtualization tools to try and configure a single ported VF through
the "wrong" PF port.

To handle that, we use the PF driver mapping of single port VFs to NIC
ports and adjust the port value before calling into the low level
code that does the actual VF configuration
