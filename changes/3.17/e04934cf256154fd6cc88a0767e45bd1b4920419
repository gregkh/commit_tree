drm/i915: semaphore debugfs

Simple debugfs file to display the current state of semaphores. This is
useful if you want to see the state without hanging the GPU.

NOTE: This patch is optional to the series.

NOTE2: Like the GPU error state collection, the reads are currently
incoherent.

v2 (Rodrigo): * Iterate only on active rings.
   	      * s/ring_buffer/engine_cs.
