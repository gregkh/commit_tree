scsi: restructure command initialization for TYPE_FS requests

We should call the device handler prep_fn for all TYPE_FS requests,
not just simple read/write calls that are handled by the disk driver.

Restructure the common I/O code to call the prep_fn handler and zero
out the CDB, and just leave the call to scsi_init_io to the ULDs.
