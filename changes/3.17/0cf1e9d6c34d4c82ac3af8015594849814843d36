zram: fix incorrect stat with failed_reads

Since we allocate a temporary buffer in zram_bvec_read to handle partial
page operations in commit 924bd88d703e ("Staging: zram: allow partial
page operations"), our ->failed_reads value may be incorrect as we do
not increase its value when failing to allocate the temporary buffer.

Let's fix this issue and correct the annotation of failed_reads.
