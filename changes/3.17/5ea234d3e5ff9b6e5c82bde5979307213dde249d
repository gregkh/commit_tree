Bluetooth: Clear HCI_RAW flag when controller becomes configured

When an unconfigured controllers reaches the configured state, it is

the controller is fully operational.

External configuration allows to bring the controller back into an
unconfigured state. In that case make sure HCI_RAW flag is set again.
