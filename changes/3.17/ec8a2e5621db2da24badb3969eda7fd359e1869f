tipc: same receive code path for connection protocol and data messages

As a preparation to eliminate port_lock we need to bring reception
of connection protocol messages under proper protection of bh_lock_sock
or socket owner.

We fix this by letting those messages follow the same code path as
incoming data messages.

As a side effect of this change, the last reference to the function
net_route_msg() disappears, and we can eliminate that function.
