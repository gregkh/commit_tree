usb: ci_hdrc_imx: Return -EINVAL for missing USB PHY

-ENODEV is interpreted by the generic driver probing function as a
non-matching driver. This leads to a missing probe failure message.

Also a missing USB PHY is more of an invalid configuration of the usb
driver because it is necessary.

This patch returns -EINVAL if devm_usb_get_phy_by_phandle() returned -ENODEV.
