ext4: fix ext4_discard_allocated_blocks() if we can't allocate the pa struct

If there is a failure while allocating the preallocation structure, a
number of blocks can end up getting marked in the in-memory buddy
bitmap, and then not getting released.  This can result in the
following corruption getting reported by the kernel:

EXT4-fs error (device sda3): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:758: group 1126,
12793 clusters in bitmap, 12729 in gd

In that case, we need to release the blocks using mb_free_blocks().

Tested: fs smoke test; also demonstrated that with injected errors,
	the file system is no longer getting corrupted
