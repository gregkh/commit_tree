ftrace: Update all ftrace_ops for a ftrace_hash_ops update

When updating what an ftrace_ops traces, if it is registered (that is,
actively tracing), and that ftrace_ops uses the shared global_ops
local_hash, then we need to update all tracers that are active and
also share the global_ops' ftrace_hash_ops.
