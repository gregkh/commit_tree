workqueue: remove @wakeup from worker_set_flags()

worker_set_flags() has only two callers, each specifying %true and
%false for @wakeup.  Let's push the wake up to the caller and remove
@wakeup from worker_set_flags().  The caller can use the following
instead if wakeup is necessary:

	worker_set_flags();
	if (need_more_worker(pool))
 		wake_up_worker(pool);

This makes the code simpler.  This patch doesn't introduce behavior
changes.
