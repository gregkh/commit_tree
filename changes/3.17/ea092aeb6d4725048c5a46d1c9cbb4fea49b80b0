tools lib traceevent: Add back in kvm plugins nested_vmexit events

The nested vmexit events were removed from the backport from trace-cmd because
they were considered buggy. They have since been updated in trace-cmd but
are still missing from the traceevent library. Add back in the buggy
version to be able to backport the fixes.
