powerpc/perf: Fix ABIv2 kernel backtraces

ABIv2 kernels are failing to backtrace through the kernel. An example:

39.30%  readseek2_proce  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] find_get_entry
            |
            --- find_get_entry
               __GI___libc_read

The problem is in valid_next_sp() where we check that the new stack
pointer is at least STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD below the previous one.

ABIv1 has a minimum stack frame size of 112 bytes consisting of 48 bytes
and 64 bytes of parameter save area. ABIv2 changes that to 32 bytes
with no paramter save area.

STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD is in theory the minimum stack frame size,
but we over 240 uses of it, some of which assume that it includes
space for the parameter area.

We need to work through all our stack defines and rationalise them
but let's fix perf now by creating STACK_FRAME_MIN_SIZE and using
in valid_next_sp(). This fixes the issue:

30.64%  readseek2_proce  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] find_get_entry
            |
            --- find_get_entry
               pagecache_get_page
               generic_file_read_iter
               new_sync_read
               vfs_read
               sys_read
               syscall_exit
               __GI___libc_read
