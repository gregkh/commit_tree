bridge: export knowledge about the presence of IGMP/MLD queriers

With this patch other modules are able to ask the bridge whether an
IGMP or MLD querier exists on the according, bridged link layer.

Multicast snooping can only be performed if a valid, selected querier
exists on a link.

Just like the bridge only enables its multicast snooping if a querier
exists, e.g. batman-adv too can only activate its multicast
snooping in bridged scenarios if a querier is present.

For instance this export avoids having to reimplement IGMP/MLD
querier message snooping and parsing in e.g. batman-adv, when
multicast optimizations for bridged scenarios are added in the
future.
