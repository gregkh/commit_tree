ipv6: clean up anycast when an interface is destroyed

If we try to rmmod the driver for an interface while sockets with
setsockopt(JOIN_ANYCAST) are alive, some refcounts aren't cleaned up
and we get stuck on:

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for ens3 to become free. Usage count = 1

If we LEAVE_ANYCAST/close everything before rmmod'ing, there is no
problem.

We need to perform a cleanup similar to the one for multicast in
addrconf_ifdown(how == 1).
