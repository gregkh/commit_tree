MIPS: GIC: Fix GICBIS macro

The GICBIS macro could update the GIC registers incorrectly, depending
on the data value passed in:

* Bits were only OR'd into the register data, so register fields could
  not be cleared.

* Bits were OR'd into the register data without masking the data to the
  correct field width, corrupting adjacent bits.
