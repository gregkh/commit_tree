drbd: don't implicitly resize Diskless node beyond end of device

During handshake, we compare backend sizes, and user set limits,
and agree on what device size we are going to expose.

We remember that last-agreed-size in our meta data.

But if we come up diskless, we have to accept what the peer
presents us with. We used to accept the peers maximum potential
capacity (backend size), which is wrong, and could lead to IO errors
due to access beyond end of device.

Instead, we need to accept the peer's current size.
Unless that is communicated as 0, in which case we
accept the backend size, or the user set limit, if set.
