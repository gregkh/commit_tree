gpio: move gpio_ensure_requested() into legacy C file

gpio_ensure_requested() only makes sense when using the integer-based
GPIO API, so make sure it is called from there instead of the gpiod
API which we know cannot be called with a non-requested GPIO anyway.

The uses of gpio_ensure_requested() in the gpiod API were kind of
out-of-place anyway, so putting them in gpio-legacy.c helps clearing the
code.

Actually, considering the time this ensure_requested mechanism has been
around, maybe we should just turn this patch into "remove
gpio_ensure_requested()" if we know for sure that no user depend on it
anymore?
