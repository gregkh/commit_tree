Revert "ACPI / battery: fix wrong value of capacity_now reported when fully charged"

This reverts commit 232de5143790 ("ACPI / battery: fix wrong value of
capacity_now reported when fully charged")

There is nothing wrong or unexpected about 'capacity_now' increasing above
the last 'full_charge_capacity' value. Different charging cycles will cause
'full_charge_capacity' to vary, both up and down.  Good battery firmwares
will update 'full_charge_capacity' when the current charging cycle is
complete, increasing it if necessary. It might even go above
'design_capacity' on a fresh and healthy battery.

Capping 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity' is plain wrong, and
printing a warning if this doesn't happen to match the 'design_capacity'
is both annoying and terribly wrong.

This results in bogus warnings on perfectly working systems/firmwares:

 [Firmware Bug]: battery: reported current charge level (39800) is higher than reported maximum charge level (39800).

and wrong values being reported for 'capacity_now' and
'full_charge_capacity' after the warning has been triggered.
