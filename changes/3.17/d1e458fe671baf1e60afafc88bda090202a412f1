svcrdma: remove rdma_create_qp() failure recovery logic

In svc_rdma_accept(), if rdma_create_qp() fails, there is useless
logic to try and call rdma_create_qp() again with reduced sge depths.
The assumption, I guess, was that perhaps the initial sge depths
chosen were too big.  However they initial depths are selected based
on the rdma device attribute max_sge returned from ib_query_device().
If rdma_create_qp() fails, it would not be because the max_send_sge and
max_recv_sge values passed in exceed the device's max.  So just remove
this code.
