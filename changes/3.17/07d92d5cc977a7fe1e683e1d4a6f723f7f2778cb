macvlan: allow to enqueue broadcast pkt on virtual device

Since commit 412ca1550cbe ("macvlan: Move broadcasts into a work queue"), the
driver uses tx_queue_len of the master device as the limit of packets enqueuing.
Problem is that virtual drivers have this value set to 0, thus all broadcast
packets were rejected.
Because tx_queue_len was arbitrarily chosen, I replace it with a static limit
of 1000 (also arbitrarily chosen).
