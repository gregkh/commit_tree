KVM: x86: Avoid emulating instructions on #UD mistakenly

Commit d40a6898e5 mistakenly caused instructions which are not marked as
EmulateOnUD to be emulated upon #UD exception. The commit caused the check of
whether the instruction flags include EmulateOnUD to never be evaluated. As a
result instructions whose emulation is broken may be emulated.  This fix moves
the evaluation of EmulateOnUD so it would be evaluated.
