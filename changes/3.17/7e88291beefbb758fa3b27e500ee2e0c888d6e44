cpuset: make cs->{cpus, mems}_allowed as user-configured masks

Now we've used effective cpumasks to enforce hierarchical manner,
we can use cs->{cpus,mems}_allowed as configured masks.

Configured masks can be changed by writing cpuset.cpus and cpuset.mems
only. The new behaviors are:

- They won't be changed by hotplug anymore.
- They won't be limited by its parent's masks.

This ia a behavior change, but won't take effect unless mount with
sane_behavior.

v2:
- Add comments to explain the differences between configured masks and
effective masks.
