xfs: introduce xfs_bulkstat_grab_ichunk

From: Jie Liu <jeff.liu@oracle.com>

Introduce xfs_bulkstat_grab_ichunk() to look up an inode chunk in where
the given inode resides, then grab the record.  Update the data for the
pointed-to record if the inode was not the last in the chunk and there
are some left allocated, return the grabbed inode count on success.

Refactor xfs_bulkstat() with it.
