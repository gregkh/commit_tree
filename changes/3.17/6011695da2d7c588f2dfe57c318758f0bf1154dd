nfsd: Add reference counting to the lock and open stateids

When we remove the client_mutex, we'll need to be able to ensure that
these objects aren't destroyed while we're not holding locks.

Add a ->free() callback to the struct nfs4_stid, so that we can
release a reference to the stid without caring about the contents.
