sched: Fix clock_gettime(CLOCK_[PROCESS/THREAD]_CPUTIME_ID) monotonicity

If a task has been dequeued, it has been accounted.  Do not project
cycles that may or may not ever be accounted to a dequeued task, as
that may make clock_gettime() both inaccurate and non-monotonic.

Protect update_rq_clock() from slight TSC skew while at it.
