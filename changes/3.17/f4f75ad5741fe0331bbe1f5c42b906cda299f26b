efi: efistub: Convert into static library

This patch changes both x86 and arm64 efistub implementations
from #including shared .c files under drivers/firmware/efi to
building shared code as a static library.

The x86 code uses a stub built into the boot executable which
uncompresses the kernel at boot time. In this case, the library is
linked into the decompressor.

In the arm64 case, the stub is part of the kernel proper so the library
is linked into the kernel proper as well.
