ARM: tegra: rebuild tegra_defconfig

Run "make tegra_defconfig; make savedefconf" on v3.16-rc1. This allows
other people to do the same thing to adjust the defconfig file without
their patch bringing in a bunch of irrelevant diffs.

All of the removed options either have been removed from Kconfig, or
are now default y.
