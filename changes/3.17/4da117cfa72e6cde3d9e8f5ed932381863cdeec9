rcu: Remove redundant ACCESS_ONCE() from tick_do_timer_cpu

In kernels built with CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL, tick_do_timer_cpu is constant
once boot completes.  Thus, there is no need to wrap it in ACCESS_ONCE()
in code that is built only when CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL.  This commit therefore
removes the redundant ACCESS_ONCE().
