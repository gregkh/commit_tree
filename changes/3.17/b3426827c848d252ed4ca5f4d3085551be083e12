KEYS: make partial key id matching as a dedicated function

To avoid code duplication this patch refactors asymmetric_key_match(),
making partial ID string match a separate function.

This patch also implicitly fixes a bug in the code.  asymmetric_key_match()
allows to match the key by its subtype. But subtype matching could be
undone if asymmetric_key_id(key) would return NULL. This patch first
checks for matching spec and then for its value.
