perf script: Handle the num array type in python properly

The raw_syscalls:sys_enter tracer for instance passes has one argument
named 'arg' which is an array of 6 integers. Right the python scripts
gets only 0 passed as an argument. The reason is that
pevent_read_number() can not handle data types of 48 and returns always
0.
This patch changes this by passing num array as list of nums which fit
the description. As a result python will now see a list named arg which
contains 6 (integer) items.
