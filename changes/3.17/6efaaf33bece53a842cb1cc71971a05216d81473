iwlwifi: mvm: enable scheduled scan on newest firmware

Scheduled scan was disabled because of a bug in the firmware.
The firmware reported support for this feature, but enabling
it led to assertions.
The bugs have been fixes in latest firmware versions, so that
we can re-enable the feature on latest firmwares only.
