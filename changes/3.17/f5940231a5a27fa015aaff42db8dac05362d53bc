Input: atmel_mxt_ts - improve description of gpio-keymap property

The below patch improves the documentation for the gpio-property. Stephen
Warren has a good example here:
https://github.com/swarren/linux-tegra/commit/09789801

trackpad@4b {
  compatible = "atmel,maxtouch";
  reg = <0x4b>;
  interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
  interrupts = <TEGRA_GPIO(W, 3) IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
  linux,gpio-keymap = <0 0 0 BTN_LEFT>;
};

This maps BTN_LEFT to the 4th bit of the T19 message.
