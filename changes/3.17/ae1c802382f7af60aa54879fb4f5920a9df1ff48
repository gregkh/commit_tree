cpuset: apply cs->effective_{cpus,mems}

Now we can use cs->effective_{cpus,mems} as effective masks. It's
used whenever:

- we update tasks' cpus_allowed/mems_allowed,
- we want to retrieve tasks_cs(tsk)'s cpus_allowed/mems_allowed.

They actually replace effective_{cpu,node}mask_cpuset().

effective_mask == configured_mask & parent effective_mask except when
the reault is empty, in which case it inherits parent effective_mask.
The result equals the mask computed from effective_{cpu,node}mask_cpuset().

This won't affect the original legacy hierarchy, because in this case we
make sure the effective masks are always the same with user-configured
masks.
