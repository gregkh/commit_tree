iwlwifi: mvm: read the mac address in family 8000

In family 8000 products the MAC address in the OTP could be in either:
- WFPM address
- PCIE address
In sdio product we should read it from the WFPM, in pcie product we
should read it from the PCIe location.
This is relevant only from otp version 0xE08 and above.
While at it, fix the bytes order in version 0xE08.
