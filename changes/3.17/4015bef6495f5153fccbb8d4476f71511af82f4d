[media] media: davinci: vpif_capture: drop unneeded module params

Remove bogus 'numbuffers' and 'bufsize' module options. The number of buffers and
buffer sizes are determined by VIDIOC_REQBUFS and VIDIOC_S_FMT and the amount of
available memory (in the case of the MMAP stream I/O mode) and not by module
options.

These module params are a left-over from the original montavista code that used
these parameters to pre-allocate the memory needed for the buffers. The code that
allocated those buffers was never upstreamed since by the time the drivers were
added to the kernel the TI cmem module could be used in combination with the
USERPTR mode to reserve and pass physically contiguous memory pointers around.

These days of course CMA is used instead of cmem.

This patch removes these module options altogether since they no longer do what
they originally were designed for. They should never have been part of the
upstreamed code in the first place, so they've been pointless ever since
2.6.32 when this driver first appeared in the mainline kernel.
