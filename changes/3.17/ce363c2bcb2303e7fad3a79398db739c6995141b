ideapad-laptop: Change Lenovo Yoga 2 series rfkill handling

It seems that the same problems which lead to adding an rfkill blacklist and
putting the Lenovo Yoga 2 11 on it are also present on the Lenovo Yoga 2 13
and Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro too:

Testing has shown that the firmware rfkill settings are persistent over
reboots. So blacklisting the driver is not good enough, if the wifi is blocked
at the firmware level the wifi needs to be explictly unblocked through the
ideapad-laptop interface.

And at least on the Lenovo Yoga 2 13 the VPCCMD_RF register which on devices
with hardware kill switch reports the hardware switch state, needs to be
explictly set to 1 (radio enabled / not blocked).

So this patch does 3 things to get proper rfkill handling on these models:

1) Instead of blacklisting the rfkill functionality, which means that people
with a firmware blocked wifi get stuck in that situation, ignore the value
reported by the not present hardware rfkill switch, as this is what is causing
ideapad-laptop to wrongly report all radios as hardware blocks. But do register
the rfkill interfaces so that the user can soft [un]block them.

2) On models without a hardware rfkill switch, explictly set VPCCMD_RF to 1

3) Drop the " 11" postfix from the dmi match string, as the entire Yoga 2
series is affected.
