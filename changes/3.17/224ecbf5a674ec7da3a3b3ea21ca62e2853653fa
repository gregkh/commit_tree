pnfs: fix filelayout_retry_commit when idx > 0

filelayout_retry_commit was recently split out from alloc_ds_commits,
but was done in such a way that the bucket pointer always starts at
index 0 no matter what the @idx argument is set to.

The intention of the @idx argument is to retry commits starting at
bucket @idx. This is called when alloc_ds_commits fails for a bucket.
