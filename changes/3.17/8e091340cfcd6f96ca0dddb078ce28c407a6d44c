enic: fix lockdep around devcmd_lock

We were experiencing occasional "BUG: scheduling while atomic" splats
in our testing. Enabling DEBUG_SPINLOCK and DEBUG_LOCKDEP in the kernel
exposed a lockdep in the enic driver.

enic 0000:0b:00.0 eth2: Link UP

======================================================
[ INFO: SOFTIRQ-safe -> SOFTIRQ-unsafe lock order detected ]
3.12.0-rc1.x86_64-dbg+ #2 Tainted: GF       W
------------------------------------------------------
NetworkManager/4209 [HC0[0]:SC0[2]:HE1:SE0] is trying to acquire:
(&(&enic->devcmd_lock)->rlock){+.+...}, at: [<ffffffffa026b7e4>] enic_dev_packet_filter+0x44/0x90 [enic]

The fix was to replace spin_lock with spin_lock_bh for the enic
devcmd_lock, so that soft irqs would be disabled while the lock
is held.
