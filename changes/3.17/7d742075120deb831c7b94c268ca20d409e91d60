percpu-refcount: use unsigned long for pcpu_count pointer

percpu_ref->pcpu_count is a percpu pointer with a status flag in its
lowest bit.  As such, it always goes through arithmetic operations
which is very cumbersome to do on a pointer.  It has to be first
casted to unsigned long and then back.

Let's just make the field unsigned long so that we can skip the first
casts.  While at it, rename it to pcpu_counter_ptr to clarify that
it's a pointer value.
