mfd: cros_ec: Check result code from EC messages

Just because the host was able to talk to the EC doesn't mean that the EC
was happy with what it was told. Errors in communincation are not the same
as error messages from the EC itself.

This change lets the EC report its errors separately.

[dianders: Added common function to cros_ec.c]
