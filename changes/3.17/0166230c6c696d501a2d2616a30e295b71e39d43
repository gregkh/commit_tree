iwlwifi: mvm: remove update type argument from quota update

It turns out that adding the update type argument was pointless as
quota update is never called from the add_interface() callback.
Therefore, IWL_MVM_QUOTA_UPDATE_TYPE_NEW isn't actually needed and
then only a "disabled_vif" argument is needed for the upcoming CSA
work.

Remove the whole enum iwl_mvm_quota_update_type and pass the right
arguments (always NULL for disabled vif right now) to the function
in all current call sites.
