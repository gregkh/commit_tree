tracing: Make trace_seq_putmem_hex() more robust

Currently trace_seq_putmem_hex() can only take as a parameter a pointer
to something that is 8 bytes or less, otherwise it will overflow the
buffer. This is protected by a macro that encompasses the call to
trace_seq_putmem_hex() that has a BUILD_BUG_ON() for the variable before
it is passed in. This is not very robust and if trace_seq_putmem_hex() ever
gets used outside that macro it will cause issues.

Instead of only being able to produce a hex output of memory that is for
a single word, change it to be more robust and allow any size input.
