hwpoison: fix race with changing page during offlining

When a hwpoison page is locked it could change state due to parallel
modifications.  The original compound page can be torn down and then
this 4k page becomes part of a differently-size compound page is is a
standalone regular page.

Check after the lock if the page is still the same compound page.

We could go back, grab the new head page and try again but it should be
quite rare, so I thought this was safest.  A retry loop would be more
difficult to test and may have more side effects.

The hwpoison code by design only tries to handle cases that are
reasonably common in workloads, as visible in page-flags.

I'm not really that concerned about handling this (likely rare case),
just not crashing on it.
