Bluetooth: Pass initiator/acceptor information to hci_conn_security()

We're interested in whether an authentication request is because of a
remote or local action. So far hci_conn_security() has been used both
for incoming and outgoing actions (e.g. RFCOMM or L2CAP connect
requests) so without some modifications it cannot know which peer is
responsible for requesting authentication.

This patch adds a new "bool initiator" parameter to hci_conn_security()
to indicate which side is responsible for the request and updates the
current users to pass this information correspondingly.
