drm: extract legacy ctxbitmap flushing

The ctxbitmap code is only used by legacy drivers so lets try to keep it
as separated as possible. Furthermore, the locking is non-obvious and
kinda weird with ctxlist_mutex *and* struct_mutex. Keeping all ctxbitmap
access in one file is much easier to review and makes drm_release() more
readable.
