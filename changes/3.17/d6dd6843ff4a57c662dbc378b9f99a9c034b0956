drm/i915: fix plane/cursor handling when runtime suspended

If we're runtime suspended and try to use the plane interfaces, we
will get a lot of WARNs saying we did the wrong thing.

We need to get runtime PM references to pin the objects, and to
change the fences. The pin functions are the ideal places for
this, but intel_crtc_cursor_set_obj() doesn't call them, so we also
have to add get/put calls inside it. There is no problem if we runtime
suspend right after these functions are finished, because the
registers written are forwarded to system memory.

Note: for a complete fix of the cursor-dpms test case, we also need
the patch named "drm/i915: Don't try to enable cursor from setplane
when crtc is disabled".

v2: - Narrow the put/get calls on intel_crtc_cursor_set_obj() (Daniel)
v3: - Make get/put also surround the fence and unpin calls (Daniel and
      Ville).
    - Merge all the plane changes into a single patch since they're
      the same fix.
    - Add the comment requested by Daniel.
v4: - Remove spurious whitespace (Ville).
v5: - Remove intel_crtc_update_cursor() chunk since Ville did an
      equivalent fix in another patch (Ville).
v6: - Remove unpin chunk: it will be on a separate patch (Ville,
      Chris, Daniel).
v7: - Same thing, new color.
