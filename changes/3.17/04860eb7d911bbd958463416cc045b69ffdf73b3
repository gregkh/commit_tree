bnx2x: Configure device endianity on driver load and reset endianity on removal.

Some hosts can be both little and big endian.
In certain scenarios a big endian kernel can kexec a little endian kernel.

This patch fixes this case from both ends:
1) Return endianity to original values on shutdown (in case little endian kernel boots after we shutdown).
2) Do not rely on HW reset values when loading driver in little endian kernel
   but configure them explicitly (in case previous kernel was big endian and did not reset the HW).
