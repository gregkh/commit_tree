drm/tilcdc: panel: fix leak when unloading the module

The driver did not unregister the allocated framebuffer, which caused
memory leaks (and memory manager WARNs) when unloading. Also, the
framebuffer device under /dev still existed after unloading.

Add a call to drm_fbdev_cma_fini when unloading the module to prevent
both issues.
