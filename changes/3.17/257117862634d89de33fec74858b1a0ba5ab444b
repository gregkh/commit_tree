net: sched: shrink struct qdisc_skb_cb to 28 bytes

We cannot make struct qdisc_skb_cb bigger without impacting IPoIB,
or increasing skb->cb[] size.

Commit e0f31d849867 ("flow_keys: Record IP layer protocol in
skb_flow_dissect()") broke IPoIB.

Only current offender is sch_choke, and this one do not need an
absolutely precise flow key.

If we store 17 bytes of flow key, its more than enough. (Its the actual
size of flow_keys if it was a packed structure, but we might add new
fields at the end of it later)
