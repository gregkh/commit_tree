x86/reboot: Add EFI reboot quirk for ACPI Hardware Reduced flag

It appears that the BayTrail-T class of hardware requires EFI in order
to powerdown and reboot and no other reliable method exists.

This quirk is generally applicable to all hardware that has the ACPI
Hardware Reduced bit set, since usually ACPI would be the preferred
method.
