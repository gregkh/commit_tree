r8152: disable ALDPS

If the hw is in ALDPS mode, the hw may have no response for accessing
the most registers. Therefore, the ALDPS should be disabled before
accessing the hw in rtl_ops.init(), rtl_ops.disable(), rtl_ops.up(),
and rtl_ops.down(). Regardless of rtl_ops.enable(), because the hw
wouldn't enter ALDPS mode when linking on. The hw would enter the
ALDPS mode after several seconds when link down occurs and the ALDPS
is enabled.
