ARM: 8165/1: alignment: don't break misaligned NEON load/store

The alignment fixup incorrectly decodes faulting ARM VLDn/VSTn
instructions (where the optional alignment hint is given but incorrect)
as LDR/STR, leading to register corruption. Detect these and correctly
treat them as unhandled, so that userspace gets the fault it expects.
