powerpc/fsl-pci: Correct use of ! and &

In commit ae91d60ba88ef0bdb1b5e9b2363bd52fc45d2af7, a bug was fixed that
involved converting !x & y to !(x & y).  The code below shows the same
pattern, and thus should perhaps be fixed in the same way.

This is not tested and clearly changes the semantics, so it is only
something to consider.

The Coccinelle semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:

// <smpl>
@@ expression E1,E2; @@
(
  !E1 & !E2
|
- !E1 & E2
+ !(E1 & E2)
)
// </smpl>
