efi/reboot: Add generic wrapper around EfiResetSystem()

Implement efi_reboot(), which is really just a wrapper around the
EfiResetSystem() EFI runtime service, but it does at least allow us to
funnel all callers through a single location.

It also simplifies the callsites since users no longer need to check to
see whether EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES are enabled.
