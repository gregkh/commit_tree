ufs: Fix queue depth handling for best effort cases

Some UFS devices may expose bLUQueueDepth field as zero indicating
that the queue depth depends on the number of resources available
for LUN at a particular instant to handle the outstanding transfer
requests. Currently, when response for SCSI command is TASK_FULL
the LLD decrements the queue depth but fails to increment when the
resources are available. The scsi mid-layer handles the change in
queue depth heuristically and offers simple interface with
->change_queue_depth.
