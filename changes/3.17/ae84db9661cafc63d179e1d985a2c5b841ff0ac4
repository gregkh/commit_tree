serial: core: Preserve termios c_cflag for console resume

When a tty is opened for the serial console, the termios c_cflag
settings are inherited from the console line settings.
However, if the tty is subsequently closed, the termios settings
are lost. This results in a garbled console if the console is later
suspended and resumed.

Preserve the termios c_cflag for the serial console when the tty
is shutdown; this reflects the most recent line settings.

Fixes: Bugzilla #69751, 'serial console does not wake from S3'
