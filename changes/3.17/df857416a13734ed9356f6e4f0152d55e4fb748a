arm64: cpuinfo: record cpu system register values

Several kernel subsystems need to know details about CPU system register
values, sometimes for CPUs other than that they are executing on. Rather
than hard-coding system register accesses and cross-calls for these
cases, this patch adds logic to record various system register values at
boot-time. This may be used for feature reporting, firmware bug
detection, etc.

Separate hooks are added for the boot and hotplug paths to enable
one-time intialisation and cold/warm boot value mismatch detection in
later patches.
