sunrpc: fix RCU handling of gc_ctx field

The handling of the gc_ctx pointer only seems to be partially RCU-safe.
The assignment and freeing are done using RCU, but many places in the
code seem to dereference that pointer without proper RCU safeguards.

Fix them to use rcu_dereference and to rcu_read_lock/unlock, and to
properly handle the case where the pointer is NULL.
