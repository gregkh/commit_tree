w1: mxc_w1: Optimize mxc_w1_ds2_touch_bit()

According to the i.MX reference manual, the read/write bit operations
takes from 60 us to 120 us.
This patch optimizes mxc_w1_ds2_touch_bit() function to use proper
value for such delay. Nevertheless, a small margin for the timeout has
been added for the case if clock frequency is inaccurate.
