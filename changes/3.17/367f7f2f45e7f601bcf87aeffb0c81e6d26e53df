slab: remove a useless lockdep annotation

Now, there is no code to hold two lock simultaneously, since we don't
call slab_destroy() with holding any lock.  So, lockdep annotation is
useless now.  Remove it.

v2: don't remove BAD_ALIEN_MAGIC in this patch. It will be removed
    in the following patch.
