sunrpc: clean up sparse endianness warnings in gss_krb5_wrap.c

Fix the endianness handling in gss_wrap_kerberos_v1 and drop the memset
call there in favor of setting the filler bytes directly.

In gss_wrap_kerberos_v2, get rid of the "ec" variable which is always
zero, and drop the endianness conversion of 0. Sparse handles 0 as a
special case, so it's not necessary.
