ARM: tegra: apalis/colibri t30: fix on-module 5v0 supplies

Working on Gigabit/PCIe support in U-Boot for Apalis T30 I realised
that the current device tree source includes for our modules only
happen to work due to referencing the on-carrier 5v0 supply from USB
which is not at all available on-module. The modules actually contain
TPS60150 charge pumps to generate the PMIC required 5 volts from the
one and only 3.3 volt module supply. This patch fixes this.

(Note: When back-porting this to v3.16 stable releases, simply drop the
change to tegra30-apalis.dtsi; that file was added in v3.17)
