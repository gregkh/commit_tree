gpio: simplify gpiochip_export()

For some reason gpiochip_export() would invalidate all the descriptors
of a chip if exporting it to sysfs failed. This does not appear as
necessary. Remove that part of the code.

While we are at it, add a note about the non-safety of temporarily
releasing a spinlock in the middle of the loop that protects its
iterator, and explain why this is done.
