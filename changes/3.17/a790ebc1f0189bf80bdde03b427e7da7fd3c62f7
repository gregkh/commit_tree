staging: emxx_udc: Fix build error

devm_request_and_ioremap has been removed since commit c9d53c0f2d23
("devres: remove devm_request_and_ioremap()") Use devm_ioremap_resource
instead. While at it, also remove redundant error message as it is now
handled by devm_ioremap_resource. Without this patch we get the following
build error:
drivers/staging/emxx_udc/emxx_udc.c:3370:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘devm_request_and_ioremap’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
