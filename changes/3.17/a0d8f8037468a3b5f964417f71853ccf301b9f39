scripts: modpost: Remove numeric suffix pattern matching

For several years, the pattern "foo$" has effectively been treated as
equivalent to "foo" due to a bug in the (misnamed) helper
number_prefix(). This hasn't been observed to cause any problems, so
remove the broken $ functionality and change all foo$ patterns to foo.
