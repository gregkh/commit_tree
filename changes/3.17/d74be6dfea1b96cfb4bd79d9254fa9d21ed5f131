gpio: remove gpiod_lock/unlock_as_irq()

gpio_lock/unlock_as_irq() are working with (chip, offset) arguments and
are thus not using the old integer namespace. Therefore, there is no
reason to have gpiod variants of these functions working with
descriptors, especially since the (chip, offset) tuple is more suitable
to the users of these functions (GPIO drivers, whereas GPIO descriptors
are targeted at GPIO consumers).
