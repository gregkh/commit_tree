KVM: s390: move vcpu wakeup code to a central point

Let's move the vcpu wakeup code to a central point.

We should set the vcpu->preempted flag only if the target is actually sleeping
and before the real wakeup happens. Otherwise the preempted flag might be set,
when not necessary. This may result in immediate reschedules after schedule()
in some scenarios.

The wakeup code doesn't require the local_int.lock to be held.
