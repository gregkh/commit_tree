dcache: d_obtain_alias callers don't all want DISCONNECTED

There are a few d_obtain_alias callers that are using it to get the
root of a filesystem which may already have an alias somewhere else.

This is not the same as the filehandle-lookup case, and none of them
actually need DCACHE_DISCONNECTED set.

It isn't really a serious problem, but it would really be clearer if we
reserved DCACHE_DISCONNECTED for those cases where it's actually needed.

In the btrfs case this was causing a spurious printk from
nfsd/nfsfh.c:fh_verify when it found an unexpected DCACHE_DISCONNECTED
dentry.  Josef worked around this by unsetting DCACHE_DISCONNECTED
manually in 3a0dfa6a12e "Btrfs: unset DCACHE_DISCONNECTED when mounting
default subvol", and this replaces that workaround.
