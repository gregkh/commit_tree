usb: musb: fix bit mask for CSR in musb_h_tx_flush_fifo()

The datasheet says that MUSB_TXCSR_FLUSHFIFO is only valid when
MUSB_TXCSR_TXPKTRDY is set as well.

With this patch applied, the warning in this function does no longer
kick in when an USB soundcard is unplugged while the stream is active.
