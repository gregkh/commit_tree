usb: musb: core: Convert the musb_platform_reset to have a return value.

Currently musb_platform_reset() is only used by dsps.
In case of BABBLE interrupt for other platforms the  musb_platform_reset()
is a NOP. In such situations no need to re-initialize the endpoints.
Also in the latest silicon revision of AM335x, we do have a babble recovery
mechanism without resetting the IP block. In preperation to add that support
its better to have a rest_done return for  musb_platform_reset().
