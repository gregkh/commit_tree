scsi_lib: remove the description string in scsi_io_completion()

During IO with fabric faults, one generally sees several "Unhandled error
code" messages in the syslog as shown below:

sd 4:0:6:2: [sdbw] Unhandled error code
sd 4:0:6:2: [sdbw] Result: hostbyte=DID_NO_CONNECT driverbyte=DRIVER_OK
sd 4:0:6:2: [sdbw] CDB: Read(10): 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 00
end_request: I/O error, dev sdbw, sector 0

This comes from scsi_io_completion (in scsi_lib.c) while handling error
codes other than DID_RESET or not deferred sense keys i.e. this is
actually handled by the SCSI mid layer. But what gets displayed here is
"Unhandled error code" which is quite misleading as it indicates
something that is not addressed by the mid layer.

The description string is based on the sense key and sometimes on the
additional sense code;
since the ACTION_FAIL case always prints the sense key and the
additional sense code, this patch removes the description string
completely because it does not add useful information.
