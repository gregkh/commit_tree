of/fdt: fix memory range check

In cases where board has below memory DT node

memory{
	device_type = "memory";
	reg = <0x80000000 0x80000000>;
};

Check on the memory range in fdt.c will always fail because it is
comparing MAX_PHYS_ADDR with base + size, in fact it should compare
it with base + size - 1.

This issue was originally noticed on Qualcomm IFC6410 board.
Without this patch kernel shows up noticed unnecessary warnings

[    0.000000] Machine model: Qualcomm APQ8064/IFC6410
[    0.000000] Ignoring memory range 0xffffffff - 0x100000000
[    0.000000] cma: Reserved 64 MiB at ab800000

as a result the size get reduced to 0x7fffffff which looks wrong.

This patch fixes the check involved in generating this warning and
as a result it also fixes the wrong size calculation.
