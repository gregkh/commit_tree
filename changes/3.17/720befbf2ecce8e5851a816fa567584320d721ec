iwlwifi: mvm: Define AUX ROC Command

Add new AUX ROC command that is intended for HS2.0 purposes.
It is used to send ANQP requests on a specific channel.

This command requests the firmware to trigger a time event
and remain on a certain channel for a given duration.
Triggering the time event is done by using the Aux
Framework in the firmware, and makes use of the Aux station
(similarly to scan).
