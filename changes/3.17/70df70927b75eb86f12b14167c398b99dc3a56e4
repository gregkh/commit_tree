drbd: allow write-ordering policy to be bumped up again

Previously, once you disabled flushes as a means of enforcing
write-ordering, you'd need to detach/re-attach to enable them again.

Allow drbdsetup disk-options to re-enable previously disabled
write-ordering policy options at runtime.

While at it fix RCU in drbd_bump_write_ordering()
max_allowed_wo() uses rcu_dereference, therefore it must
be called within rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock()
