KVM: x86: Assertions to check no overrun in MSR lists

Currently there is no check whether shared MSRs list overrun the allocated size
which can results in bugs. In addition there is no check that vmx->guest_msrs
has sufficient space to accommodate all the VMX msrs.  This patch adds the
assertions.
