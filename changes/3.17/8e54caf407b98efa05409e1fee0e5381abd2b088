tpm: Provide a generic means to override the chip returned timeouts

Some Atmel TPMs provide completely wrong timeouts from their
TPM_CAP_PROP_TIS_TIMEOUT query. This patch detects that and returns
new correct values via a DID/VID table in the TIS driver.

Tested on ARM using an AT97SC3204T FW version 37.16
