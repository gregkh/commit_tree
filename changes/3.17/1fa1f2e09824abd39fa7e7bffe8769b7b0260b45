amd-xgbe-phy: Allow more time for Rx/Tx to become ready

The current time range waiting for Rx/Tx to become ready can sometimes
be too short if a connection is not present.  Increase the number of
retries and the sleep to give a bit more time. Also, change level of
the message issued from _err to _dbg if Rx/Tx do not become ready
since the underlying logic will function as if no link is established
and retry eventually.
