tg3: Work around HW/FW limitations with vlan encapsulated frames

TG3 appears to have an issue performing TSO and checksum offloading
correclty when the frame has been vlan encapsulated (non-accelrated).
In these cases, tcp checksum is not correctly updated.

This patch attempts to work around this issue.  After the patch,
802.1ad vlans start working correctly over tg3 devices.
