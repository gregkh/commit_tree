printk: Add function to return log buffer address and size

Platforms like IBM Power Systems supports service processor
assisted dump. It provides interface to add memory region to
be captured when system is crashed.

During initialization/running we can add kernel memory region
to be collected.

Presently we don't have a way to get the log buffer base address
and size. This patch adds support to return log buffer address
and size.
