i40e: Fix the FD sideband logic to detect a FD table full condition

Hardware does not have a way of telling a PF how much of the global
shared FD table space is still available or is consumed.
Previously, every PF but PF0 would think there was still space available
when there wasn't. The PFs would continue to try to add filters and fail.
With this new logic if a filter programming error is detected we just
check if we are close to the guaranteed space full and that can be used
as a hint to say, there might not be space and we should turn off the
features. This way we can turn off the feature in SW for all PFs in
time.
