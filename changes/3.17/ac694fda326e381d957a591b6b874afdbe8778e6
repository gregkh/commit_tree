arm64, ftrace: Remove check of obsolete variable function_trace_stop

Nothing sets function_trace_stop to disable function tracing anymore.
Remove the check for it in the arch code.

arm64 was broken anyway, as it had an ifdef testing
 CONFIG_HAVE_FUNCTION_TRACE_MCOUNT_TEST which is only set if
the arch supports the code (which it obviously did not), and
it was testing a non existent ftrace_trace_stop instead of
function_trace_stop.
