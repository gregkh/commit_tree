ARM: SPEAr13xx: Add pcie and miphy DT nodes

This patch adds necessary DT nodes for pcie controllers and miphys for SPEAr13xx
SoCs.

SPEAr1310 has 3 PCIe ports and SPEAr1340 has 1, which are multiplexed with
ahci/sata pins. By default evaluation board of both controller works in ahci
mode. Because of this, these nodes are marked "disabled" by default.

In order to use pcie controller on evaluation boards do necessary modifications
on board and enable (By replacing "disabled" with "okay") pcie and miphy from
respective 'evb' dtsi file.

Phy specific initialization was previously done from spear1340.c, which isn't
required anymore as we have separate drivers for it. Remove it.
