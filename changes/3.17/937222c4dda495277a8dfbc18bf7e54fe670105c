pwm-backlight: Fix bogus request for GPIO#0 when instantiated from DT

commit 257462dbf3ed ("pwm-backlight: switch to gpiod interface")
introduced a regression leading to acquiring a bogus GPIO-0 when
configured from DT without an 'enable-gpios' property.
The driver will happily accept the 0 initialized 'enable_gpio' member
of the struct platform_pwm_backlight_data as valid gpio number, and
request this GPIO as enable pin. In case of multiple driver instances,
the second will fail to register with the error message:
pwm-backlight backlight1.23: failed to request GPIO#0: -16

Fix this by setting enable_gpio in the pdata struct to -EINVAL.
