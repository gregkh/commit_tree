clk: qcom: Fix sdc 144kHz frequency entry

The pre-divider for the sdc clocks only has 2 bits in it, so we
can't possibly divide by anything larger than 4 here.
Furthermore, we program the value of ~(n - m) and the n value is
larger than 8 bits (max of 256). Replace this entry with 200kHz
which is close enough to 144kHz to be usable.
