enable fallocate punch hole ("fallocate -p") for SMB3

Implement FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE (which does not change the file size
fortunately so this matches the behavior of the equivalent SMB3
fsctl call) for SMB3 mounts.  This allows "fallocate -p" to work.
It requires that the server support setting files as sparse
(which Windows allows).
