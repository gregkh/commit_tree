mfd: cros_ec: Tweak struct cros_ec_device for clarity

The members of struct cros_ec_device were improperly commented, and
intermixed the private and public sections. This is just cleanup to make it
more obvious what goes with what.

[dianders: left lock in the structure but gave it the name that will
eventually be used.]
