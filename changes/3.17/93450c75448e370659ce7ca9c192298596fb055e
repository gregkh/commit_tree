Bluetooth: Convert pend_le_conn list to a generic action list

In preparation to store also HCI_AUTO_CONN_REPORT entries in a list it
makes sense to convert the existing pend_le_conn list head of
hci_conn_params into a more generically named "action". This makes sense
because a parameter entry will never participate in more than one action
list.
