Bluetooth: Provide L2CAP ops callback for memcpy_fromiovec

The highly optimized TX path for L2CAP channels and its fragmentation
within the HCI ACL packets requires to copy data from user provided
IO vectors and also kernel provided memory buffers.

This patch allows channel clients to provide a memcpy_fromiovec callback
to keep this optimized behavior, but adapt it to kernel vs user memory
for the TX path. For all kernel internal L2CAP channels, a default
implementation is provided that can be referenced.

In case of A2MP, this fixes a long-standing issue with wrongly accessing
kernel memory as user memory.
