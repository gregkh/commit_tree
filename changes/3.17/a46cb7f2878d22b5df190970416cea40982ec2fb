nfsd: cleanup and rename nfs4_check_open

Rename it to better describe what it does, and have it just return the
stateid instead of a __be32 (which is now always nfs_ok). Also, do the
search for an existing stateid after the delegation check, to reduce
cleanup if the delegation check returns error.
