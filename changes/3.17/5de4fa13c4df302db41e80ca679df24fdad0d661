cgroup: initialize cgrp_dfl_root_inhibit_ss_mask from !->dfl_files test

cgrp_dfl_root_inhibit_ss_mask determines which subsystems are not
supported on the default hierarchy and is currently initialized
statically and just includes the debug subsystem.  Now that there's
cgroup_subsys->dfl_files, we can easily tell which subsystems support
the default hierarchy or not.

Let's initialize cgrp_dfl_root_inhibit_ss_mask by testing whether
cgroup_subsys->dfl_files is NULL.  After all, subsystems with NULL
->dfl_files aren't useable on the default hierarchy anyway.
