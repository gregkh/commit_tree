xfs: require 64-bit sector_t

Trying to support tiny disks only and saving a bit memory might have
made sense on an SGI O2 15 years ago, but is pretty pointless today.

Remove the rarely tested codepath that uses various smaller in-memory
types to reduce our test matrix and make the codebase a little bit
smaller and less complicated.
