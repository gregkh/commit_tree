ARM: tegra: Use a function to get the chip ID

Instead of using a simple variable access to get at the Tegra chip ID,
use a function so that we can run additional code. This can be used to
determine where the chip ID is being accessed without being available.
That in turn will be handy for resolving boot sequence dependencies in
order to convert more code to regular initcalls rather than a sequence
fixed by Tegra SoC setup code.
