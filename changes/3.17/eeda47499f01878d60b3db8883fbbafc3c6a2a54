ufs: adjust queue settings to PRDT limitations

The data byte count field of PRDT indicates the length of data block
which is a segment of data transfer for SCSI commands.  The value of
this field shall have Dword granularity and the the maximum of length
is 256KB.

This adjusts dma pad mask and max segment size to the above-mentioned
PRDT limitations.
