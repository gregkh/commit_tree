iwlwifi: mvm: treat EAPOLs like mgmt frames wrt rate

Using the LQ table which is initially set according to
the rssi could lead to EAPOLs being sent in high legacy
rates like 54mbps.
It's better to avoid sending EAPOLs in high rates as it reduces
the chances of a successful 4-Way handshake.
Avoid this and treat them like other mgmt frames which would
initially get sent at the basic rate.
