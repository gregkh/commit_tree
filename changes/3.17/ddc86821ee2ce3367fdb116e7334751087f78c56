irqchip: gic-v3: Only define gic_peek_irq() when building SMP

If building with CONFIG_SMP disbled (for example, with allnoconfig) then
GCC complains that the static function gic_peek_irq() is defined but not
used since the only reference is in the SMP initialisation code. Fix this
by moving the function definition inside the ifdef.
