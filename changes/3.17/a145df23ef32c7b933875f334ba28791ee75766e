enic: Add Accelerated RFS support

This patch adds supports for Accelerated Receive Flow Steering.

When the desired rx is different from current rq, for a flow, kernel calls the
driver function enic_rx_flow_steer(). enic_rx_flow_steer adds a IP-TCP/UDP
hardware filter.

Driver registers a timer function enic_flow_may_expire. This function is called
every HZ/4 seconds. In this function we check if the added filter has expired
by calling rps_may_expire_flow(). If the flow has expired, it removes the hw
filter.

As of now adaptor supports only IPv4 - TCP/UDP filters.
