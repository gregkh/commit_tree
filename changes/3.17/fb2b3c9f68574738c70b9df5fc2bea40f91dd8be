clk: define and export clk_debugs_add_file

Define and export a new function clk_debugs_add_file which adds a file
to a existing clock's debugfs directory. This can be used by clock
providers to add debugfs entries which are not related to a specific clock
type. Examples include the ability to measure the rate of a clock. It can
also be used by modules to create new debugfs entries. This is useful if you
want to expose features for testing which can potentially cause system
instability such as allowing to change a clock's rate from userspace.
