net: sctp: Open out the check for Nagle

The check for Nagle contains 6 separate checks all of which must be true
before a data packet is delayed.
Separate out each into its own 'if (test) return SCTP_XMIT_OK' so that
the reasons can be individually described.

Also return directly with SCTP_XMIT_RWND_FULL.
Delete the now-unused 'retval' variable and 'finish' label from
sctp_packet_can_append_data().
