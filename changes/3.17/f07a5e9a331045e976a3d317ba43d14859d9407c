tpm: Add missing tpm_do_selftest to ST33 I2C driver

Most device drivers do call 'tpm_do_selftest' which executes a
TPM_ContinueSelfTest. tpm_i2c_stm_st33 is just pointlessly different,
I think it is bug.

These days we have the general assumption that the TPM is usable by
the kernel immediately after the driver is finished, so we can no
longer defer the mandatory self test to userspace.
