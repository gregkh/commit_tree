Input: synaptics - add support for ForcePads

ForcePads are found on HP EliteBook 1040 laptops. They lack any kind of
physical buttons, instead they generate primary button click when user
presses somewhat hard on the surface of the touchpad. Unfortunately they
also report primary button click whenever there are 2 or more contacts
on the pad, messing up all multi-finger gestures (2-finger scrolling,
multi-finger tapping, etc). To cope with this behavior we introduce a
delay (currently 50 msecs) in reporting primary press in case more
contacts appear.
