staging: comedi: amplc_pc236: remove manual configuration of PCI boards

Remove the code that allows PCI boards to be manually attached by the
`COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl (or the "comedi_config" application).
Supported PCI boards (PCI236) will be attached automatically at probe
time via `comedi_pci_auto_config()` and the `auto_attach` hook in the
`struct comedi_driver`.

The "wildcard" entry in `pc236_boards[]` was only used when manually
attaching a PCI board using a driver name instead of a board name, so is
no longer needed.  Remove it.
