serial: altera_jtaguart: Fix putchar function passed to uart_console_write()

Commit 3d1c90d48cbe335a ("serial: altera_jtaguart: Adpot
uart_console_write()") introduced the usage of uart_console_write() but
didn't change the signature of altera_jtaguart_console_putc() to take a
pointer to struct uart_port instead of struct console, breaking the
driver's console support and leading to the following warning:

>    drivers/tty/serial/altera_jtaguart.c: In function 'altera_jtaguart_console_write':
> >> drivers/tty/serial/altera_jtaguart.c:350:2: warning: passing argument 4 of 'uart_console_write' from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
>      uart_console_write(port, s, count, altera_jtaguart_console_putc);
>      ^
>    In file included from drivers/tty/serial/altera_jtaguart.c:25:0:
>    include/linux/serial_core.h:317:6: note: expected 'void (*)(struct uart_port *, int)' but argument is of type 'void (*)(struct console *, int)'
>     void uart_console_write(struct uart_port *port, const char *s,

Fix this by adjusting the signature of altera_jtaguart_console_putc()
accordingly.
