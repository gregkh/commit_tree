x86, vdso: Move the vvar area before the vdso text

Putting the vvar area after the vdso text is rather complicated: it
only works of the total length of the vdso text mapping is known at
vdso link time, and the linker doesn't allow symbol addresses to
depend on the sizes of non-allocatable data after the PT_LOAD
segment.

Moving the vvar area before the vdso text will allow is to safely
map non-allocatable data after the vdso text, which is a nice
simplification.
