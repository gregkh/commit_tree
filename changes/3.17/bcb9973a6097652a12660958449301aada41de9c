serial: sh-sci: Fix range check of bit-rate for HSCIF

If bit-rate calculation result of HSCIF is expect 255 from 0,
driver does not calculate error bit. However, we need to round
the value to calculate error bit in the case of negative value.
This rounds the value of bit-rate using clamp(), and bit-rate is the
case of negative value, it enables the calculation of the error bit.
