[media] media: pvrusb2: make logging code sane

The issue was discovered by static analysis. It turns out that code is
somewhat insane, being
if (x) {...} else { if (x) {...} }

Edited it to do the only reasonable thing, which is to log the
information about the failed call. The most descriptive logging commands
set is taken from original code.
