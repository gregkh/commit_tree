drbd: Limit the time we are waiting for the first packet on an accepted socket

Before the patch
'drbd: Keep the listening socket open while trying to connect to the peer'

the newly created socket inherited the receive timeout from the listen
socket. The listen socket had a receive timeout of connect-intervall
+- 30% random jitter.

The real issue is that after the mentioned patch we had no timeout at all.
Now use 4 times the ping-timeout.
