drbd: drbd_rs_number_requests: fix unit mismatch in comparison

We try to limit the number of "in-flight" resync requests.
One condition for that is the amount of requested data should not exceed
half of what can be covered by our "max-buffers" setting.

However we compared number of 4k pages with number of in-flight 512 Byte
sectors, and this extra throttle triggered much earlier than intended.
