ACPICA: Restore error table definitions to reduce code differences between Linux and ACPICA upstream.

The following commit has changed ACPICA table header definitions:

 Commit: 88f074f4871a8c212b212b725e4dcdcdb09613c1
 Subject: ACPI, CPER: Update cper info

While such definitions are currently maintained in ACPICA. As the
modifications applying to the table definitions affect other OSPMs'
drivers, it is very difficult for ACPICA to initiate a process to
complete the merge. Thus this commit finally only leaves us divergences.

Revert such naming modifications to reduce the source code differecnes
between Linux and ACPICA upstream. No functional changes.
