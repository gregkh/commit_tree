staging: lustre: Fix sparse warnings

Declare several functions and variables as static in order
to address the following sparse warnings

drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/acceptor.c:49:3: warning: symbol 'lnet_acceptor_state' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/acceptor.c:79:1: warning: symbol 'lnet_acceptor_get_tunables' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/acceptor.c:211:1: warning: symbol 'lnet_accept' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/acceptor.c:333:1: warning: symbol 'lnet_acceptor' was not declared. Should it be static?

Tested by compilation only.
