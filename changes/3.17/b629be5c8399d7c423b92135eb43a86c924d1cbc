net: bcmgenet: check harder for out of memory conditions

There is a potential case where we might be failing to refill a
control block, leaving it with both a NULL skb pointer *and* a NULL
dma_unmap_addr.

The way we process incoming packets, by first calling
dma_unmap_single(), and then only checking for a potential NULL skb can
lead to situations where do pass a NULL dma_unmap_addr() to
dma_unmap_single(), resulting in an oops.

Fix this my moving the NULL skb check earlier, since no backing skb
also means no corresponding DMA mapping for this packet.
