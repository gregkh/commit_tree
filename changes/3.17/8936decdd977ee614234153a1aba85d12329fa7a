spi: davinci: request cs_gpio's from probe

Now CS GPIOs are requested from struct spi_master.setup() callback
and that causes failures when Client SPI device is getting accessed
through SPIDEV driver. The failure happens, because .setup() callback
may be called many times from IOCTL handler and when it's called
second time gpio_request() will fail and return -EBUSY.

Hence, fix it by moving CS GPIOs requesting code in .probe().
