scsi_scan: Fixup scsilun_to_int()

scsilun_to_int() has an error which prevents it from generating
correct LUN numbers for 64bit values.
Also we should remove the misleading comment about portions of
the LUN being ignored; the initiator should treat the LUN as
an opaque value.
And, finally, the example given should use the correct
prefix (here: extended flat space addressing scheme).

This patch includes the modifications suggested by
Bart van Assche.
