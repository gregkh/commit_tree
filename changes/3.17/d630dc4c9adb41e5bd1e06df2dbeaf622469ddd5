percpu-refcount: one bit is enough for REF_STATUS

percpu-refcount currently reserves two lowest bits of its percpu
pointer to indicate its state; however, only one bit is used for
PCPU_REF_DEAD.

Simplify it by removing PCPU_STATUS_BITS/MASK and testing
PCPU_REF_DEAD directly.  This also allows the compiler to choose a
more efficient instruction depending on the architecture.
