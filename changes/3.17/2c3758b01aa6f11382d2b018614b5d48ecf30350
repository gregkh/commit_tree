ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: Remove spurious 0x from SCIFB clock name

A stray '0x' crept into a0f7e7496d56ac2d ("ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: add CMT1
clock support for DT"). This  patch removes it.

This change should not have any run-time affect at this time as
the clock in question is used by a SCIF device that is not enabled by
default.
