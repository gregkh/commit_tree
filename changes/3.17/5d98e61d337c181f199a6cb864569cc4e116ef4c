I2C/ACPI: Add i2c ACPI operation region support

ACPI 5.0 spec(5.5.2.4.5) defines GenericSerialBus(i2c, spi, uart) operation region.
It allows ACPI aml code able to access such kind of devices to implement
some ACPI standard method.

ACPI Spec defines some access attribute to associate with i2c protocol.
AttribQuick 	       	       		Read/Write Quick Protocol
AttribSendReceive			Send/Receive Byte Protocol
AttribByte 			 	Read/Write Byte Protocol
AttribWord				Read/Write Word Protocol
AttribBlock				Read/Write Block Protocol
AttribBytes				Read/Write N-Bytes Protocol
AttribProcessCall			Process Call Protocol
AttribBlockProcessCall			Write Block-Read Block Process Call Protocol
AttribRawBytes 				Raw Read/Write N-BytesProtocol
AttribRawProcessBytes			Raw Process Call Protocol

On the Asus T100TA, Bios use GenericSerialBus operation region to access
i2c device to get battery info.

Sample code From Asus T100TA

    Scope (_SB.I2C1)
    {
        Name (UMPC, ResourceTemplate ()
        {
            I2cSerialBus (0x0066, ControllerInitiated, 0x00061A80,
                AddressingMode7Bit, "\\_SB.I2C1",
                0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,
                )
        })

	...

        OperationRegion (DVUM, GenericSerialBus, Zero, 0x0100)
        Field (DVUM, BufferAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
        {
            Connection (UMPC),
            Offset (0x81),
            AccessAs (BufferAcc, AttribBytes (0x3E)),
            FGC0,   8
        }
	...
     }

     Device (BATC)
     {
         Name (_HID, EisaId ("PNP0C0A"))  // _HID: Hardware ID
         Name (_UID, One)  // _UID: Unique ID
	 ...

            Method (_BST, 0, NotSerialized)  // _BST: Battery Status
            {
                If (LEqual (AVBL, One))
                {
                    Store (FGC0, BFFG)
                    If (LNotEqual (STAT, One))
                    {
                        ShiftRight (CHST, 0x04, Local0)
                        And (Local0, 0x03, Local0)
                        If (LOr (LEqual (Local0, One), LEqual (Local0, 0x02)))
                        {
                            Store (0x02, Local1)
                        }
	...

    }

The i2c operation region is defined under I2C1 scope. _BST method under
battery device BATC read battery status from the field "FCG0". The request
would be sent to i2c operation region handler.

This patch is to add i2c ACPI operation region support. Due to there are
only "Byte" and "Bytes" protocol access on the Asus T100TA, other protocols
have not been tested.

About RawBytes and RawProcessBytes protocol, they needs specific drivers to interpret
reference data from AML code according ACPI 5.0 SPEC(5.5.2.4.5.3.9 and 5.5.2.4.5.3.10).
So far, not found such case and will add when find real case.
