rtnetlink: fix VF info size

Commit 1d8faf48c74b8 ("net/core: Add VF link state control") added new
attribute to IFLA_VF_INFO group in rtnl_fill_ifinfo but did not adjust size
of the allocated memory in if_nlmsg_size/rtnl_vfinfo_size. As the result, we
may trigger warnings in rtnl_getlink and similar functions when many VF
links are enabled, as the information does not fit into the allocated skb.
