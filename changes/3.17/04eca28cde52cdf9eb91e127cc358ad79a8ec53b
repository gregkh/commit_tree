regulator: Add helpers for low-level register access

Add helper functions that allow regulator consumers to obtain low-level
details about the regulator hardware, like the voltage selector register
address and such. These details can be useful when configuring hardware
or firmware that want to do low-level access to regulators, with no
involvement from the kernel.

The use-case for Tegra is a voltage-controlled oscillator clocksource
which has control logic to change the supply voltage via I2C to achieve
a desired output clock rate.
