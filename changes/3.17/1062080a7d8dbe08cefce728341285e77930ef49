    Avoid SMP cacheflushes.  This is a minor optimization of startup but
    will also avoid smp_call_function from doing stupid things when called
    from a CPU that is not yet marked online.

missed an appropriate cache flush of TLB refill handler because that time it was
at fixed location CAC_BASE. After years the refill handler in EBASE vector
is not at that location and can be allocated in some another memory and needs
I-cache sync as other TLB exception vectors.

Besides that, the new function - local_flash_icache_range() was introduced
to avoid SMP cacheflushes.
