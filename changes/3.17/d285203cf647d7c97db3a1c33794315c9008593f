scsi: add support for a blk-mq based I/O path.

This patch adds support for an alternate I/O path in the scsi midlayer
which uses the blk-mq infrastructure instead of the legacy request code.

Use of blk-mq is fully transparent to drivers, although for now a host
template field is provided to opt out of blk-mq usage in case any unforseen
incompatibilities arise.

In general replacing the legacy request code with blk-mq is a simple and
mostly mechanical transformation.  The biggest exception is the new code
that deals with the fact the I/O submissions in blk-mq must happen from
process context, which slightly complicates the I/O completion handler.
The second biggest differences is that blk-mq is build around the concept
of preallocated requests that also include driver specific data, which
in SCSI context means the scsi_cmnd structure.  This completely avoids
dynamic memory allocations for the fast path through I/O submission.

Due the preallocated requests the MQ code path exclusively uses the
host-wide shared tag allocator instead of a per-LUN one.  This only
affects drivers actually using the block layer provided tag allocator
instead of their own.  Unlike the old path blk-mq always provides a tag,
although drivers don't have to use it.

For now the blk-mq path is disable by defauly and must be enabled using
the "use_blk_mq" module parameter.  Once the remaining work in the block
layer to make blk-mq more suitable for slow devices is complete I hope
to make it the default and eventually even remove the old code path.

Based on the earlier scsi-mq prototype by Nicholas Bellinger.

Thanks to Bart Van Assche and Robert Elliot for testing, benchmarking and
various sugestions and code contributions.
