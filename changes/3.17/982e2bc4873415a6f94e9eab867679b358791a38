staging: comedi: amplc_pc236: set board_name before common attach

For PCI boards, the `auto_attach` handler, `pc236_auto_attach()`,
initializes `dev->board_ptr` to point to a `struct pc236_board`, but
leaves `dev->board_name` unchanged.  The Comedi core will have
initialized `dev->board_name` to the `driver_name` string member of
`amplc_pc236_driver`.  For consistency with ISA boards manually
configured by the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl via the legacy `attach`
handler, `pc236_attach()`, set `dev->board_name` to the `name` member of
the `struct pc236_board` pointed to by `dev->board_ptr`.

Both `pc236_attach()` and `pc236_auto_attach()` call
`pc236_common_attach()`, which also sets `dev->board_name` to the `name`
member of the `struct pc236_board`.  Since this assignment no longer
changes anything, remove it.

A nice side-effect of this change is that the same owner name string is
used for requesting I/O regions (before the call the
`pc236_common_attach()`) as is used for requesting the IRQ handler
(during the call to `pc236_common_attach()`).  It was already the same
for (manually configured) ISA boards, but is now the same for
(automatically configured) PCI boards.
