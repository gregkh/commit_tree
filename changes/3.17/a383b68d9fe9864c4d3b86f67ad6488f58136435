ACPI / scan: not cache _SUN value in struct acpi_device_pnp

The _SUN device indentification object is not guaranteed to return
the same value every time it is executed, so we should not cache its
return value, but rather execute it every time as needed.  If it is
cached, an incorrect stale value may be used in some situations.

This issue was exposed by commit 202317a573b2 (ACPI / scan: Add
acpi_device objects for all device nodes in the namespace).  Fix it
by avoiding to cache the return value of _SUN.
