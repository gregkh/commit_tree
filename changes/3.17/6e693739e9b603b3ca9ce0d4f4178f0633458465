USB: ehci-pci: USB host controller support for Intel Quark X1000

The EHCI packet buffer in/out threshold is programmable for Intel Quark X1000
USB host controller, and the default value is 0x20 dwords. The in/out threshold
can be programmed to 0x80 dwords (512 Bytes) to maximize the perfomrance,
but only when isochronous/interrupt transactions are not initiated by the USB
host controller. This patch is to reconfigure the packet buffer in/out
threshold as maximal as possible to maximize the performance, and 0x7F dwords
(508 Bytes) should be used because the USB host controller initiates
isochronous/interrupt transactions.
