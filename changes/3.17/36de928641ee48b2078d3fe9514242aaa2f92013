ext4: propagate errors up to ext4_find_entry()'s callers

If we run into some kind of error, such as ENOMEM, while calling
ext4_getblk() or ext4_dx_find_entry(), we need to make sure this error
gets propagated up to ext4_find_entry() and then to its callers.  This
way, transient errors such as ENOMEM can get propagated to the VFS.
This is important so that the system calls return the appropriate
error, and also so that in the case of ext4_lookup(), we return an
error instead of a NULL inode, since that will result in a negative
dentry cache entry that will stick around long past the OOM condition
which caused a transient ENOMEM error.
