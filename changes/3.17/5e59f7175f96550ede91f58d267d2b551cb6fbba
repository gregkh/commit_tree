drm/i915: Try harder to get FBC

The GEN FBC unit provides the ability to set a low pass on frames it
attempts to compress. If a frame is less than a certain amount
compressibility (2:1, 4:1) it will not bother. This allows the driver to
reduce the size it requests out of stolen memory.

Unluckily, a few months ago, Ville actually began using this feature for
framebuffers that are 16bpp (not sure why not 8bpp). In those cases, we
are already using this mechanism for a different purpose, and so we can
only achieve one further level of compression (2:1 -> 4:1)

FBC GEN1, ie. pre-G45 is ignored.

The cleverness of the patch is Art's. The bugs are mine.

v2: Update message and including missing threshold case 3 (Spotted by Arthur).
