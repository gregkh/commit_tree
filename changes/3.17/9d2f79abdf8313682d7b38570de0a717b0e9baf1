staging:iio-trig-periodic-rtc: Allow to reset frequency to 0

periodic rtc trigger initially has frequency 0

it is possible to change trigger frequency on-the-fly, but it is not
possible to set frequency back to 0

this patch allows to set trigger frequency to 0, thereby disabling
the rtc interrupt
