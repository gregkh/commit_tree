printk: miscellaneous cleanups

Some small cleanups to kernel/printk/printk.c.  None of them should
cause any change in behavior.

  - When CONFIG_PRINTK is defined, parenthesize the value of LOG_LINE_MAX.
  - When CONFIG_PRINTK is *not* defined, there is an extra LOG_LINE_MAX
    definition; delete it.
  - Pull an assignment out of a conditional expression in console_setup().
  - Use isdigit() in console_setup() rather than open coding it.
  - In update_console_cmdline(), drop a NUL-termination assignment;
    the strlcpy() call that precedes it guarantees it's not needed.
  - Simplify some logic in printk_timed_ratelimit().
