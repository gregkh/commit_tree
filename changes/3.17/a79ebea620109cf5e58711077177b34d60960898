MIPS: ptrace: Fix user pt_regs definition, use in ptrace_{get, set}regs()

In uapi/asm/ptrace.h, a user version of pt_regs is defined wrapped in
ifndef __KERNEL__. This structure definition does not match anything
used by any kernel API, in particular it does not match the format used
by PTRACE_{GET,SET}REGS.

Therefore, replace the structure definition with one matching what is
used by PTRACE_{GET,SET}REGS. The format used by these is the same for
both 32-bit and 64-bit.

Also, change the implementation of PTRACE_{GET,SET}REGS to use this new
structure definition. The structure is renamed to user_pt_regs when
__KERNEL__ is defined to avoid conflicts with the kernel's own pt_regs.
