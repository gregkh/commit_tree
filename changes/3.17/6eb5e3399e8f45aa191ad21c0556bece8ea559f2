[media] media: em28xx-dvb - fix em28xx_dvb_resume() to not unregister i2c and dvb

em28xx_dvb_resume() unregisters i2c tuner, i2c demod, and dvb.
This erroneous cleanup results in i2c tuner, i2c demod, and dvb
devices unregistered and removed during resume. This error is a
result of merge conflict between two patches that went into 3.15.
