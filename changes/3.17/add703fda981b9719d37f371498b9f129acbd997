blk-mq: use percpu_ref for mq usage count

Currently, blk-mq uses a percpu_counter to keep track of how many
usages are in flight.  The percpu_counter is drained while freezing to
ensure that no usage is left in-flight after freezing is complete.
blk_mq_queue_enter/exit() and blk_mq_[un]freeze_queue() implement this
per-cpu gating mechanism.

This type of code has relatively high chance of subtle bugs which are
extremely difficult to trigger and it's way too hairy to be open coded
in blk-mq.  percpu_ref can serve the same purpose after the recent
changes.  This patch replaces the open-coded per-cpu usage counting
and draining mechanism with percpu_ref.

blk_mq_queue_enter() performs tryget_live on the ref and exit()
performs put.  blk_mq_freeze_queue() kills the ref and waits until the
reference count reaches zero.  blk_mq_unfreeze_queue() revives the ref
and wakes up the waiters.
