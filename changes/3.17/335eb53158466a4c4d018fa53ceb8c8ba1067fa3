proc: faster /proc/$PID lookup

Currently lookup for /proc/$PID first goes through spinlock and whole list
of misc /proc entries only to confirm that, yes, /proc/42 can not possibly
match random proc entry.

List is is several dozens entries long (52 entries on my setup).

None of this is necessary.

Try to convert dentry name to integer first.
If it works, it must be /proc/$PID.
If it doesn't, it must be random proc entry.

Based on patch from Al Viro.
