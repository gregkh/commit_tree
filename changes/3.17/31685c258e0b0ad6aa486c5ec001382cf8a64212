drm/i915/vlv: WA for Turbo and RC6 to work together.

With RC6 enabled, BYT has an HW issue in determining the right
Gfx busyness.
WA for Turbo + RC6: Use SW based Gfx busy-ness detection to decide
on increasing/decreasing the freq. This logic will monitor C0
counters of render/media power-wells over EI period and takes
necessary action based on these values

v2: Refactor duplicate code. (Ville)

v3: Reformat the comments. (Ville)

v4: Enable required counters and remove unwanted code (Ville)

v5: Added frequency change acceleration support and remove kernel-doc
style comments. (Ville)

v6: Updated comment section and Fix w/a comment. (Ville)
