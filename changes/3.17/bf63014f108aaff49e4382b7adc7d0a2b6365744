qlcnic: Set driver version before registering netdev

o Earlier, set_drv_version was getting called after register_netdev.
  This was resulting in a race between set_drv_version and FLR called
  from open(). Moving set_drv_version before register_netdev avoids
  the race.

o Log response code in error message on CDRP failure.
