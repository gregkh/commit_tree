net: fec: move calls to quiesce/resume packet processing out of fec_restart()

Move the calls to quiesce and resume packet processing out of
fec_restart() to its call sites.  This is the first step in a two stage
clean up of this code, where we just move the calls out of fec_restart()
without changing them.  Not everywhere needs to issue these calls, and
not everywhere needs all of these calls to be issued.
