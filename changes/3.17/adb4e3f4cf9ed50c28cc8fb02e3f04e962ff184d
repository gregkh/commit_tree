iio: adc: exynos_adc: Control special clock of ADC to support Exynos3250 ADC

This patch control special clock for ADC in Exynos series's FSYS block.
If special clock of ADC is registerd on clock list of common clk framework,
Exynos ADC drvier have to control this clock.

Exynos3250/Exynos4/Exynos5 has 'adc' clock as following:
- 'adc' clock: bus clock for ADC

Exynos3250 has additional 'sclk_adc' clock as following:
- 'sclk_adc' clock: special clock for ADC which provide clock to internal ADC

Exynos 4210/4212/4412 and Exynos5250/5420 has not included 'sclk_adc' clock
in FSYS_BLK. But, Exynos3250 based on Cortex-A7 has only included 'sclk_adc'
clock in FSYS_BLK.
