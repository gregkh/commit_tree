mm: BUG when __kmap_atomic_idx equals KM_TYPE_NR

__kmap_atomic_idx is per_cpu variable.  Each CPU can use KM_TYPE_NR
entries from FIXMAP i.e.  from 0 to KM_TYPE_NR - 1.  Allowing
__kmap_atomic_idx to over- shoot to KM_TYPE_NR can mess up with next
CPU's 0th entry which is a bug.  Hence BUG_ON if __kmap_atomic_idx >=
KM_TYPE_NR.

Fix the off-by-on in this test.
