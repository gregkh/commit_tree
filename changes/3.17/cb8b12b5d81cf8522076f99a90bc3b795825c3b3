md/raid10: always initialise ->state on newly allocated r10_bio

Most places which allocate an r10_bio zero the ->state, some don't.
As the r10_bio comes from a mempool, and the allocation function uses
kzalloc it is often zero anyway.  But sometimes it isn't and it is
best to be safe.

I only noticed this because of the bug fixed by an earlier patch
where the r10_bios allocated for a reshape were left around to
be used by a subsequent resync.  In that case the R10BIO_IsReshape
flag caused problems.
