mm: describe mmap_sem rules for __lock_page_or_retry() and callers

Add a comment describing the circumstances in which
__lock_page_or_retry() will or will not release the mmap_sem when
returning 0.

Add comments to lock_page_or_retry()'s callers (filemap_fault(),
do_swap_page()) noting the impact on VM_FAULT_RETRY returns.

Add comments on up the call tree, particularly replacing the false "We
return with mmap_sem still held" comments.
