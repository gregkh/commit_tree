ARM: 8101/1: mach-iop13xx: fix possible build failure

After applying patch:
	"ARM: 8078/1: get rid of hardcoded assumptions about kernel stack size"

following build failure happens on iop13xx platform:

     preempt_disable();

The problem here is recursive header inclusion which could be avoided by
removing linux/reboot.h from mach/iop13xxx.h.
linux/reboot.h in include/mach/iop13xx.h is needed only for enum reboot_mode,
so header it could be replaced with a enum declaration.

Whatever patch "ARM: 8078/1: get rid of hardcoded assumptions about kernel stack size"
does, I think it's good to avoid unnecessary header inclusion here in any case.
