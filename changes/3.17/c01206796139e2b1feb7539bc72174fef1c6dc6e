Input: atkbd - do not try 'deactivate' keyboard on any LG laptops

We are getting more and more reports about LG laptops not having
functioning keyboard if we try to deactivate keyboard during probe.
Given that having keyboard deactivated is merely "nice to have"
instead of a hard requirement for probing, let's disable it on all
LG boxes instead of trying to hunt down particular models.

This change is prompted by patches trying to add "LG Electronics"/"ROCKY"
and "LG Electronics"/"LW60-F27B" to the DMI list.
