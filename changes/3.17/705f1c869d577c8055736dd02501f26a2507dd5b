ipv6: remove rt6i_genid

Eric Dumazet noticed that all no-nonexthop or no-gateway routes which
are already marked DST_HOST (e.g. input routes routes) will always be
invalidated during sk_dst_check. Thus per-socket dst caching absolutely
had no effect and early demuxing had no effect.

Thus this patch removes rt6i_genid: fn_sernum already gets modified during
add operations, so we only must ensure we mutate fn_sernum during ipv6
address remove operations. This is a fairly cost extensive operations,
but address removal should not happen that often. Also our mtu update
functions do the same and we heard no complains so far. xfrm policy
changes also cause a call into fib6_flush_trees. Also plug a hole in
rt6_info (no cacheline changes).

I verified via tracing that this change has effect.
