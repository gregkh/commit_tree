ARM: 8130/1: cpuidle/cpuidle-big_little: fix reading cpu id part number

Commit af040ffc9ba1 ("ARM: make it easier to check the CPU part number
correctly") changed ARM_CPU_PART_X masks, and the way they are returned and
checked against. Usage of read_cpuid_part_number() is now deprecated, and
calling places updated accordingly. This actually broke cpuidle-big_little
initialization, as bl_idle_driver_init() performs a check using an hardcoded
mask on cpu_id.

Create an interface to perform the check (that is now even easier to read).
Define also a proper mask (ARM_CPU_PART_MASK) that makes this kind of checks
cleaner and helps preventing bugs in the future. Update usage accordingly.
