x86/pmc_atom: Eisable a few S0ix wake up events for S0ix residency

Disable PMC S0IX_WAKE_EN events coming from LPC block(unused) and
also from GPIO_SUS ored dedicated IRQs (must be disabled as per PMC
programming rule), GPIOSCORE ored dedicated IRQs (must be disabled
as per PMC programming rule), GPIO_SUS shared IRQ (not necessary
since the IOAPIC_DS wake event will still work), GPIO_SCORE shared
IRQ (not necessary since the IOAPIC_DS wake event will still work).
