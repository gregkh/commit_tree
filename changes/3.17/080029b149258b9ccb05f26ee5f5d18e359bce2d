serial: lpc32xx uart module can't do console

Every uart driver that provides a console driver needs to
be built-in for the console code to work, we get a build
error for modular console drivers.

This changes the SERIAL_HS_LPC32XX_CONSOLE symbol to depend
on the SERIAL_HS_LPC32XX driver being built-in, just like
we do for all the other uart drivers.
