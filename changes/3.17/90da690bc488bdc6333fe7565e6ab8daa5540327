ACPICA: Disassembler: Add support for the ToUUID opererator (macro).

This change adds support to disassemble a UUID back to the original
ToUUID operator. It will detect a UUID within a standard AML Buffer.
Also, a description of the UUID is emitted for "known" UUIDs, defined
as UUIDs that are defined in the ACPI specification.

Since this is a change for disassembler which is not shipped in the
Linux kernel, the Linux kernel is not affected.
