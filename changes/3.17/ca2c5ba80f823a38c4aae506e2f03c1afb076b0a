usb: dwc2/gadget: fix phy initialization sequence

In the Generic PHY Framework a NULL phy is considered to be a valid phy
thus the "if (hsotg->phy)" check does not give us the information whether
the Generic PHY Framework is used.

In addition to the above this patch also removes phy_init from probe and
phy_exit from remove. This is not necessary when init/exit is done in the
s3c_hsotg_phy_enable/disable functions.
