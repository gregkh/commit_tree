MIPS: Add Loongson-3B support

Loongson-3B is a 8-cores processor. In general it looks like there are
two Loongson-3A integrated in one chip: 8 cores are separated into two
groups (two NUMA node), each node has its own local memory.

Of course there are some differences between one Loongson-3B and two
Loongson-3A. E.g., the base addresses of IPI registers of each node are
not the same; Loongson-3A use ChipConfig register to enable/disable
clock, but Loongson-3B use FreqControl register instead.

There are two revision of Loongson-3B, the first revision is called as
Loongson-3B1000, whose frequency is 1GHz and has a PRid 0x6306, the
second revision is called as Loongson-3B1500, whose frequency is 1.5GHz
and has a PRid 0x6307. Both revisions has a bug that clock cannot be
disabled at runtime, but this will be fixed in future.
