netlabel: shorter names for the NetLabel catmap funcs/structs

Historically the NetLabel LSM secattr catmap functions and data
structures have had very long names which makes a mess of the NetLabel
code and anyone who uses NetLabel.  This patch renames the catmap
functions and structures from "*_secattr_catmap_*" to just "*_catmap_*"
which improves things greatly.

There are no substantial code or logic changes in this patch.
