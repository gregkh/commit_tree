hyperv: Fix a bug in netvsc_start_xmit()

After the packet is successfully sent, we should not touch the skb
as it may have been freed. This patch is based on the work done by
Long Li <longli@microsoft.com>.

In this version of the patch I have fixed issues pointed out by David.
David, please queue this up for stable.
