checkpatch: add ability to insert and delete lines to patch/file

This can be valuable to insert or delete blank lines as well as fix
misplaced brace or else uses.

Store indexes of lines to be added/deleted and the new lines.

When creating the --fix file, insert or delete the appropriate lines and
update the patch range information.
