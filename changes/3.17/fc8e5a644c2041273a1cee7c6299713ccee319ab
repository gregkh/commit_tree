nfsd4: convert comma to semicolon

Replace a comma between expression statements by a semicolon. This changes
the semantics of the code, but given the current indentation appears to be
what is intended.

A simplified version of the Coccinelle semantic patch that performs this
transformation is as follows:
// <smpl>
@r@
expression e1,e2;
@@

 e1
-,
+;
 e2;
// </smpl>
