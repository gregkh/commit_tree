[media] vmalloc_sg: make sure all pages in vmalloc area are really DMA-ready

Patch originally written by Konrad. Rebased on current linux media tree.

Under Xen, vmalloc_32() isn't guaranteed to return pages which are really
under 4G in machine physical addresses (only in virtual pseudo-physical
addresses).  To work around this, implement a vmalloc variant which
allocates each page with dma_alloc_coherent() to guarantee that each
page is suitable for the device in question.
