Btrfs: __btrfs_mod_ref should always use no_quota

Before I extended the no_quota arg to btrfs_dec/inc_ref because I didn't
understand how snapshot delete was using it and assumed that we needed the
quota operations there.  With Mark's work this has turned out to be not the
case, we _always_ need to use no_quota for btrfs_dec/inc_ref, so just drop the
argument and make __btrfs_mod_ref call it's process function with no_quota set
always.  Thanks,
