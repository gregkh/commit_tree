ARM: OMAP2+: clock/dpll: add jitter correction behind clk_features

Currently DPLL code uses runtime cpu_is_343x checks to see if the DPLL
has freqsel fields in its control register or not. Instead, add a new
flag to the clk_features.flags and use this during runtime. Allows
eventual move of the DPLL code under clock driver.
