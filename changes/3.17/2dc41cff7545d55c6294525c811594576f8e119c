udp: Use hash2 for long hash1 chains in __udp*_lib_mcast_deliver.

Many multicast sources can have the same port which can result in a very
large list when hashing by port only. Hash by address and port instead
if this is the case. This makes multicast more similar to unicast.

On a 24-core machine receiving from 500 multicast sockets on the same
port, before this patch 80% of system CPU was used up by spin locking
and only ~25% of packets were successfully delivered.

With this patch, all packets are delivered and kernel overhead is ~8%
system CPU on spinlocks.
