nfsd: close potential race in nfsd4_free_stateid

Once we remove the client_mutex, it'll be possible for the sc_type of a
lock stateid to change after it's found and checked, but before we can
go to destroy it. If that happens, we can end up putting the persistent
reference to the stateid more than once, and unhash it more than once.

Fix this by unhashing the lock stateid prior to dropping the cl_lock but
after finding it.
