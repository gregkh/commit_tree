mm: memcontrol: use page lists for uncharge batching

Pages are now uncharged at release time, and all sources of batched
uncharges operate on lists of pages.  Directly use those lists, and
get rid of the per-task batching state.

This also batches statistics accounting, in addition to the res
counter charges, to reduce IRQ-disabling and re-enabling.
