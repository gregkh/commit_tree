ALSA: hda - Fix invalid function call in snd_hda_add_vmaster()

The recent commit [6194b99d: ALSA: hda - Kill the rest of snd_print*()
usages] changed the callback map_slaves(), but one call was forgotten
to be replaced due to the cast, which leads to kernel Oops due to
invalid function.  This patch replaces it with a proper function.
