mm,hugetlb: simplify error handling in hugetlb_cow()

When returning from hugetlb_cow(), we always (1) put back the refcount
for each referenced page -- always 'old', and 'new' if allocation was
successful.  And (2) retake the page table lock right before returning,
as the callers expects.  This logic can be simplified and encapsulated,
as proposed in this patch.  In addition to cleaner code, we also shave a
few bytes off the instruction text:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  28399     462   41328   70189   1122d mm/hugetlb.o-baseline
  28367     462   41328   70157   1120d mm/hugetlb.o-patched

Passes libhugetlbfs testcases.
