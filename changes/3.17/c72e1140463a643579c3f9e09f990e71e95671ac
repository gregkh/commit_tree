cfg80211: fix TDLS setup with VHT peers

Some VHT TDLS peers (Google Nexus 5) include the VHT-AID IE in their
TDLS setup request/response. Usermode passes this aid as the station
aid, causing it to fail verifiction, since this happens in the
"set_station" stage. Make an exception for the TDLS use-case.
