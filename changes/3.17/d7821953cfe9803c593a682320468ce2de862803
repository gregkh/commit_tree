ASoC: wm8962: Let CODEC driver enable and disable its own MCLK

snd_soc_open() will trigger pm_runtime resume() which will then enable
the regulator and initialization. So we should make sure the MCLK is
enabled before this resume().

Previously we let the machine driver get the clock and enable it in
its probe(). However, considering about power saving, it'll be better
to enable it when it's going to be used and disable it after using.

So this patch just simply adds clk_get() and clk_enable() to WM8962
driver. Meanwhile, it marks clock pointer to NULL if no clock assigned
to it so it will not break any current function.
