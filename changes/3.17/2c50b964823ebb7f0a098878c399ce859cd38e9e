ima: remove unnecessary i_mutex locking from ima_rdwr_violation_check()

Before 2.6.39 inode->i_readcount was maintained by IMA. It was not atomic
and protected using spinlock. For 2.6.39, i_readcount was converted to
atomic and maintaining was moved VFS layer. Spinlock for some unclear
reason was replaced by i_mutex.

After analyzing the code, we came to conclusion that i_mutex locking is
unnecessary, especially when an IMA policy has not been defined.

This patch removes i_mutex locking from ima_rdwr_violation_check().
