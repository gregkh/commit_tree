[media] v4l: ctrls: Provide an unlocked variant of v4l2_ctrl_modify_range()

Drivers may use the v4l2_ctrl_modify_range() internally as part of other
operations that need to be both serialised using a driver's lock which can
also be used to serialise access to the control handler. Provide an unlocked
version of the function, __v4l2_ctrl_modify_range() which then may be used
by drivers for the purpose.
