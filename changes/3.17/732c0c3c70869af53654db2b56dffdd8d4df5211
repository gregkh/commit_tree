MIPS: fix MSA context for tasks which don't use FP first

If a task does not execute scalar FP instructions prior to using MSA
then the flags indicating that the task has live MSA context were not
being set. The upper 64b of each vector register would then be lost
upon the tasks first context switch after using MSA.
