blk-mq: pass along blk_mq_alloc_tag_set return values

Two of the blk-mq based drivers do not pass back the return value
from blk_mq_alloc_tag_set, instead just returning -ENOMEM.

blk_mq_alloc_tag_set returns -EINVAL if the number of queues or
queue depth is bad.  -ENOMEM implies that retrying after freeing some
memory might be more successful, but that won't ever change
in the -EINVAL cases.

Change the null_blk and mtip32xx drivers to pass along
the return value.
