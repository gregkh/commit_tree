defxx: Fix issues with debug printk calls

This fixes issues with debug printk calls across the driver, normally
disabled; first compilation errors:

drivers/net/fddi/defxx.c:676:1: error: pasting "(" and ""In dfx_bus_init...\n"" does not give a valid preprocessing token
drivers/net/fddi/defxx.c:820:1: error: pasting "(" and ""In dfx_bus_uninit...\n"" does not give a valid preprocessing token

and so on, and then warnings:

drivers/net/fddi/defxx.c: In function 'dfx_driver_init':
drivers/net/fddi/defxx.c:1132: warning: format '%0X' expects type 'unsigned int', but argument 4 has type 'dma_addr_t'
drivers/net/fddi/defxx.c:1132: warning: format '%0X' expects type 'unsigned int', but argument 4 has type 'dma_addr_t'

etc.  Additionally casts are removed from virtual addresses and %p used.
