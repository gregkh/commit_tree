staging: board: kzm9d: Board staging support for emxx_udc

Add staging board support for the KZM9D board and add
an emxx_udc platform device to allow in-tree continous
development of the driver on the KZM9D board.

When DT bindings are ready for the emxx_udc driver then
the platform device in the KZM9D staging board code can
easily be removed. Until then we use platform devices
to continously improve the driver and integration code.
