staging: comedi: addi_apci_1564: move addi_watchdog.h include to addi_apci_1564.c

Commit aed3f9d (staging: comedi: addi_apci_1564: absorb apci1564_reset()) moved
the only use of addi_watchdog.h from hwdrv_apci1564.c to addi_apci_1564.c, but
left the include statement itself in the former file.  Move this include to the
file which actually uses it.
