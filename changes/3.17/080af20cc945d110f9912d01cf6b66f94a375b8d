NFSv4: nfs4_state_manager() vs. nfs_server_remove_lists()

There is a race between nfs4_state_manager() and
nfs_server_remove_lists() that happens during a nfsv3 mount.

The v3 mount notices there is already a supper block so
nfs_server_remove_lists() called which uses the nfs_client_lock
spin lock to synchronize access to the client list.

At the same time nfs4_state_manager() is running through
the client list looking for work to do, using the same
lock. When nfs4_state_manager() wins the race to the
list, a v3 client pointer is found and not ignored
properly which causes the panic.

Moving some protocol checks before the state checking
avoids the panic.
