ASoC: arizona: Correct relationship between VCO corner and Fref

When configuring the FLL we must ensure that the reference clock passed
to the FLL is under a certain limit. This limit was specified
incorrectly in the current code, this patch corrects this. Although the
error will only be encountered in some edge cases.
