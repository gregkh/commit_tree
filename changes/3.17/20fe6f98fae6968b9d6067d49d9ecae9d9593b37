ARM: EXYNOS: Support cluster power off on exynos5420/5800

Turning off a cluster when all 4 cores of the cluster are powered off
saves power significantly. Powering off the A15 L2 alone gives around
100mW in savings. Add support for powering off the A15/A7 clusters on
exynos5420/5800.

The patch enables specific register bits which ensure that:
   - cluster L2 will be turned on before the first man is powered up.
   - last man will be turned off before the cluster L2 is turned off.
   - core is powered down before powering it up.

Remove the exynos_cluster_power_control function completely as we can
rely on the above mentioned bits rather than polling the cluster power
status register.
