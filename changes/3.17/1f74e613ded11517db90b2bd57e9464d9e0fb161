tcp: Fix integer-overflow in TCP vegas

In vegas we do a multiplication of the cwnd and the rtt. This
may overflow and thus their result is stored in a u64. However, we first
need to cast the cwnd so that actually 64-bit arithmetic is done.

Then, we need to do do_div to allow this to be used on 32-bit arches.
