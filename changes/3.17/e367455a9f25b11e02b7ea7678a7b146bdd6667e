checkpatch: emit fewer kmalloc_array/kcalloc conversion warnings

Avoid matching allocs that appear to be known small multiplications of a
sizeof with a constant because gcc as of 4.8 cannot optimize the code in
a calloc() exactly the same way as an alloc().

Look for numeric constants or what appear to be upper case only macro
#defines.
