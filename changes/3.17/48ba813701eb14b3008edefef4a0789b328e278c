drm: drop redundant drm_file->is_master

The drm_file->is_master field is redundant as it's equivalent to:
    drm_file->master && drm_file->master == drm_file->minor->master

1) "=>"
  Whenever we set drm_file->is_master, we also set:
      drm_file->minor->master = drm_file->master;

  Whenever we clear drm_file->is_master, we also call:
      drm_master_put(&drm_file->minor->master);
  which implicitly clears it to NULL.

2) "<="
  minor->master cannot be set if it is non-NULL. Therefore, it stays as
  is unless a file drops it.

  If minor->master is NULL, it is only set by places that also adjust
  drm_file->is_master.

Therefore, we can safely drop is_master and replace it by an inline helper
that matches:
    drm_file->master && drm_file->master == drm_file->minor->master
