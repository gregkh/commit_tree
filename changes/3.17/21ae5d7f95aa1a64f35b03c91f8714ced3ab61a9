drbd: track timing details of peer_requests

To be able to present timing details in debugfs,
we need to track preparation/submit times of peer requests.

Track peer request flags early,
before they are put on the epoch_entry lists.

Waiting for activity log transactions may be a major latency factor.
We want to be able to present the peer_request state accurately in
debugfs, and what it is waiting for.

Consistently mark/unmark peer requests with EE_CALL_AL_COMPLETE_IO.
Set it only *after* calling drbd_al_begin_io(),
clear it as soon as we call drbd_al_complete_io().
