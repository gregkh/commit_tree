Bluetooth: Avoid use of session socket after the session gets freed

The commits 08c30aca9e698faddebd34f81e1196295f9dc063 "Bluetooth: Remove
RFCOMM session refcnt" and 8ff52f7d04d9cc31f1e81dcf9a2ba6335ed34905
"Bluetooth: Return RFCOMM session ptrs to avoid freed session"
allow rfcomm_recv_ua and rfcomm_session_close to delete the session
(and free the corresponding socket) and propagate NULL session pointer
to the upper callers.

Additional fix is required to terminate the loop in rfcomm_process_rx
function to avoid use of freed 'sk' memory.

The issue is only reproducible with kernel option CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING
enabled making freed memory being changed and filled up with fixed char
value used to unmask use-after-free issues.
