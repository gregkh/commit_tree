Bluetooth: Add support for using controller white list filtering

The Bluetooth controller can use a white list filter when scanning
to avoid waking up the host for devices that are of no interest.

Devices marked as reporting, direct connection (incoming) or general
connection are now added to the controller white list. The update of
the white list happens just before enabling passive scanning.

In case the white list is full and can not hold all devices, the
white list is not used and the filter policy set to accept all
advertisements.

Using the white list for scanning allows for power saving with
controllers that do not handle the duplicate filtering correctly.
