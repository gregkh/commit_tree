soc/tegra: Add efuse driver for Tegra

Implement fuse driver for Tegra20, Tegra30, Tegra114 and Tegra124. This
replaces functionality previously provided in arch/arm/mach-tegra, which
is removed in this patch.

While at it, move the only user of the global tegra_revision variable
over to tegra_sku_info.revision and export tegra_fuse_readl() to allow
drivers to read calibration fuses.
