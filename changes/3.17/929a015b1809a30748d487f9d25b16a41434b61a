ARM: edma: Fix configuration parsing for SoCs with multiple eDMA3 CC

The edma_setup_from_hw() should know about the CC number when parsing the
CCCFG register - when it reads the register to be precise. The base
addresses for CCs stored in an array and we need to provide the correct id
to edma_read() in order to read the correct register.
