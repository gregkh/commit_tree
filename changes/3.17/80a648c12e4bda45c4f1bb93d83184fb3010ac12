ACPICA: Utilities: Add formatted printing APIs

This patch introduces formatted printing APIs to handle ACPICA specific
formatted print requirements. Currently only specific OSPMs will use this
customized printing support, Linux kernel doesn't use these APIs at this
time. It will be enabled for Linux kernel resident ACPICA after being well
tested. So currently this patch is a no-op.

The specific formatted printing APIs are useful to ACPICA as:
 1. Some portable applications do not link standard C library, so they
    cannot use standard formatted print APIs directly.
 2. Platform specific printing format may differ and thus not portable, for
    example, u64 is %ull for Linux kernel and is %uI64 for some MSVC
    versions.
 3. Platform specific printing format may conflict with ACPICA's usages
    while it is not possible for ACPICA developers to test their code for
    all platforms. For example, developers may generate %pRxxx while Linux
    kernel treats %pR as structured resource printing and decodes variable
    argument as a "struct resource" pointer.
This patch solves above issues by introducing the new APIs.

Note that users of such APIs are not introduced in this patch. Users of
acpi_os_file_vprintf()/acpi_ut_file_printf() need to invoke acpi_os_initialize(),
this should be taken care by the further patches where such users are
introduced. Lv Zheng.
