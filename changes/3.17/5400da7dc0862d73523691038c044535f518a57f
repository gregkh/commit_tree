xfs: add scan owner field to xfs_eofblocks

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

The scan owner field represents an optional inode number that is
responsible for the current scan. The purpose is to identify that an
inode is under iolock and as such, the iolock shouldn't be attempted
when trimming eofblocks. This is an internal only field.
