iommu/amd: Update to use PCI DMA aliases

AMD-Vi already has a concept of an alias provided via the IVRS table.
Now that PCI-core also understands aliases, we need to incorporate
both aspects when programming the IOMMU.  IVRS is generally quite
reliable, so we continue to prefer it when an alias is present.  For
cases where we have an IVRS alias that does not match the PCI alias
or where PCI does not report an alias, report the mismatch to allow
us to collect more quirks and dynamically incorporate the alias into
the device alias quirks where possible.

This should allow AMD-Vi to work with devices like Marvell and Ricoh
with DMA function alias quirks unknown to the BIOS.
