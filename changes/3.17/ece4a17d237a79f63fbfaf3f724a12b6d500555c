drm/i915: read HEAD register back in init_ring_common() to enforce ordering

Withtout this, ring initialization fails reliabily during resume with

	[drm:init_ring_common] *ERROR* render ring initialization failed ctl 0001f001 head ffffff8804 tail 00000000 start 000e4000

This is not a complete fix, but it is verified to make the ring
initialization failures during resume much less likely.

We were not able to root-cause this bug (likely HW-specific to Gen4 chips)
yet. This is therefore used as a ducttape before problem is fully
understood and proper fix created, so that people don't suffer from
completely unusable systems in the meantime.

The discussion and debugging is happening at
