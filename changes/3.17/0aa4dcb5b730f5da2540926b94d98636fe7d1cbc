ARM: dts: vf610-twr: Fix pinctrl_esdhc1 pin definitions.

Previous version had an extra 'fsl' which made the pins not match
any entry.  The console message,

 vf610-pinctrl 40048000.iomuxc: no fsl,pins property in node \
    /soc/aips-bus@40000000/iomuxc@40048000/vf610-twr/esdhc1grp

is displayed without the fix.  The prior version would generally
work as u-boot sets the pins properly for sdhc.  This change allows
Linux sdhc use even if u-boot is built without sdhc support.
