ASoC: dapm: Remove DAI DAPM context

The DAI DAPM context was added in commit be09ad90 ("ASoC: core: Add platform DAI
widget mapping") and the only user was removed again in commit ae10e7e8f ("ASoC:
core: Only add platform DAI widgets once."). Now that we have a per component
DAPM context it is unlikely that we'll need the DAI DAPM context again.
