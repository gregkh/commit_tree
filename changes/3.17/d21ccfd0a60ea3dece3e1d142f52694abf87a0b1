ath9k_htc: fix random decryption failure

In v3.15 the driver stopped to accept network packets after successful
authentification, which could be worked around by passing the
nohwcrypt=1 module parameter.  This was not reproducible by
everyone, and showed random behaviour in some tests.
It was caused by an uninitialized variable introduced
in 4ed1a8d4a257 ("ath9k_htc: use ath9k_cmn_rx_accept") and
used in 341b29b9cd2f ("ath9k_htc: use ath9k_cmn_rx_skb_postprocess").
