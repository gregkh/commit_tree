[media] sn9c102: remove deprecated driver

During the media summit meeting in Edinburgh it was decided to move this
driver to staging as the first step to removing it altogether.

Most webcams covered by this driver are now supported by gspca. Nobody has the
hardware or is willing to convert the remaining devices to gspca.

This driver needs a major overhaul to have it conform to the latest frameworks
and compliancy tests.

Without hardware, however, this is next to impossible. Given the fact that
this driver seems to be pretty much unused (it has been removed from Fedora
several versions ago and nobody complained about that), we decided to drop
this driver.
