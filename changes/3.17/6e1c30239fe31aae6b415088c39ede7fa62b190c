pinctrl: sunxi: Add macro definition for pinctrl with more than one interrupt

The A31 and A23, unlike the other Allwinner SoCs, have several interrupts banks
and parent interrupts, while the other only have up to 32 interrupts in a
single bank and a single parent interrupt.

Start supporting it by introducing a function macro to declare irq functions
and their banks.
