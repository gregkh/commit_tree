SELinux: use ARRAY_SIZE

ARRAY_SIZE is more concise to use when the size of an array is divided
by the size of its type or the size of its first element.

The Coccinelle semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:

// <smpl>
@@
type T;
T[] E;
@@

- (sizeof(E)/sizeof(E[...]))
+ ARRAY_SIZE(E)
// </smpl>
