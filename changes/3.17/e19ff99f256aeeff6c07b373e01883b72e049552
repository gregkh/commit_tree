HID: rmi: only bind the hid-rmi driver to the mouse interface of composite USB devices

On composite HID devices there may be multiple HID devices on separate interfaces, but hid-rmi
should only bind to the mouse interface. One example is the Dell Venue 11 Pro's keyboard dock
which contains a composite USB device with a HID touchpad and HID keyboard on separate intefaces.
Since the USB Vendor ID is Synaptic's, hid-core is currently trying to bind hid-rmi to all\of
the HID devices. This patch ensures that hid-rmi only binds to the mouse interface.
