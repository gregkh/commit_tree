mm: migrate: Close race between migration completion and mprotect

A migration entry is marked as write if pte_write was true at the time the
entry was created. The VMA protections are not double checked when migration
entries are being removed as mprotect marks write-migration-entries as
read. It means that potentially we take a spurious fault to mark PTEs write
again but it's straight-forward. However, there is a race between write
migrations being marked read and migrations finishing. This potentially
allows a PTE to be write that should have been read. Close this race by
double checking the VMA permissions using maybe_mkwrite when migration
completes.
