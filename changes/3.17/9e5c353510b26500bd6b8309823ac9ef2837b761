bcache: fix uninterruptible sleep in writeback thread

There were two issues here:

- writeback thread did not start until the device first became dirty
- writeback thread used uninterruptible sleep once running

Without this patch I see kernel warnings printed and a load average of
1.52 after booting my test VM. With this patch the warnings are gone and
the load average is near 0.00 as expected.
