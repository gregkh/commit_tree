ARM: OMAP4: Ctrl module register define diet

The mach-omap2 directory contains full register defines for OMAP4
control module but only around 27 of those are used. There are is
a total of 1795 register defines in four files with only 27 in use.
That is pretty low usefulness ratio...

I guess alot more was used when we had omap4 board files and
mach-omap2 contained more drivers but this has now changed.
