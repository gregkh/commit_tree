ARM: 8096/1: Describe required sort order for textofs-y (TEXT_OFFSET)

The section of the makefile that determines the TEXT_OFFSET is sorted
by address so that, in multi-arch kernel builds, the architecture with the
most stringent requirements for the kernel base address gets to define
TEXT_OFFSET. The comment should reflect that.
