misc: bh1770glc: Use managed functions

This patch introduces the use of managed interfaces like devm_kzalloc,
devm_regulator_bulk_get and does away with the functions to free the
allocated memory in the probe and remove functions. Also, some labels
are removed and renamed to preserve the ordering.
