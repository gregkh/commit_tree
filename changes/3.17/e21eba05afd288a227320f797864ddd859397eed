xhci: Disable streams on Via XHCI with device-id 0x3432

This is a bit bigger hammer then I would like to use for this, but for now
it will have to make do. I'm working on getting my hands on one of these so
that I can try to get streams to work (with a quirk flag if necessary) and
then we can re-enable them.

For now this at least makes uas capable disk enclosures work again by forcing
fallback to the usb-storage driver.
