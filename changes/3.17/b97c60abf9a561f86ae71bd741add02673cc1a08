ASoC: samsung-i2s: Maintain CDCLK settings across i2s_{shutdown/startup}

Currently configuration of the CDCLK pad is being overwritten in
the i2s_shutdown() callback in order to gate the SoC output clock.
However if an ASoC machine driver doesn't restore that clock
settings each time after opening the sound device this results
in the CDCLK pin being permanently configured into input mode.
I.e. the output clock will always stay disabled.
Fix that by saving the CDCLKCON bit state in i2s_shutdown() and
and restoring it in the i2s_startup() callback.
