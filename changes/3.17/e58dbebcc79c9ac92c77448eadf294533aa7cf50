staging: comedi: amplc_pci230: remove PCI230_ADC_CONV

The macro `PCI230_ADC_CONV` is never used.  Just remove it.  (At one
time, the value was written to the `PCI230_ADCSWTRIG` register to
trigger a conversion, but any value would do, and the driver no longer
uses that register to trigger conversions anyway.)
