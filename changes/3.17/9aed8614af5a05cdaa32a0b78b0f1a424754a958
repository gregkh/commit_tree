mm/memory.c: don't forget to set softdirty on file mapped fault

Otherwise we may not notice that pte was softdirty because
pte_mksoft_dirty helper _returns_ new pte but doesn't modify the
argument.

In case if page fault happend on dirty filemapping the newly created pte
may loose softdirty bit thus if a userspace program is tracking memory
changes with help of a memory tracker (CONFIG_MEM_SOFT_DIRTY) it might
miss modification of a memory page (which in worts case may lead to data
inconsistency).
