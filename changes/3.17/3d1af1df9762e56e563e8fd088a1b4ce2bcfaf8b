xen-netback: Using a new state bit instead of carrier

This patch introduces a new state bit VIF_STATUS_CONNECTED to track whether the
vif is in a connected state. Using carrier will not work with the next patch
in this series, which aims to turn the carrier temporarily off if the guest
doesn't seem to be able to receive packets.
