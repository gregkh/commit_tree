net-timestamp: SOCK_RAW and PING timestamping

Add SO_TIMESTAMPING to sockets of type PF_INET[6]/SOCK_RAW:

Add the necessary sock_tx_timestamp calls to the datapath for RAW
sockets (ping sockets already had these calls).

Fix the IP output path to pass the timestamp flags on the first
fragment also for these sockets. The existing code relies on
transhdrlen != 0 to indicate a first fragment. For these sockets,
that assumption does not hold.

This fixes http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77221

Tested SOCK_RAW on IPv4 and IPv6, not PING.
