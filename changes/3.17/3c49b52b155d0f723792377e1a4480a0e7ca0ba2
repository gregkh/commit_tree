tracing: Do not do anything special with tracepoint_string when tracing is disabled

When CONFIG_TRACING is not enabled, there's no reason to save the trace
strings either by the linker or as a static variable that can be
referenced later. Simply pass back the string that is given to
tracepoint_string().

Had to move the define to include/linux/tracepoint.h so that it is still
visible when CONFIG_TRACING is not set.
