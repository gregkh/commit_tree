staging: comedi: ni_labpc: pass comedi_device to the I/O callbacks

This driver uses some callbacks in the private data to handle the
port mapped or memory mapped I/O used to access the hardware.

Pass the comedi_device pointer to the helper functions so that the
base address can be found and does not need to be included in each
call.

Also, remove the inline from the helper functions.
