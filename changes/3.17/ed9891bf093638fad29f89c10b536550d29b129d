serial: fsl_lpuart: calculate DMA burst

The DMA burst size must match the transmit FIFO depth in order
to make sure all character are transmitted. This patch calculates
DMA burst size by using FIFO depth rather than use the hardcoded
16 bytes. This is required since some UARTs (e.g. UART2 on Vybrid)
have a FIFO depth of 8 bytes.
