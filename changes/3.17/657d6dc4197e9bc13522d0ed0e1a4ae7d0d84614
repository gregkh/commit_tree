HID: huion: Fail on parameter retrieval errors

Fail Huion tablet interface enabling and probing, if parameter retrieval
fails. Move the main code path out of the else block accordingly.

This should prevent devices appearing in a half-working state due to
original report descriptor being used, simplifying diagnostics. This
also makes it easier to add cleanup in later commits, as error handling
is simplified.
