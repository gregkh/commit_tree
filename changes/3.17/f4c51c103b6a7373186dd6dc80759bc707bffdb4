pinctrl: sunxi: Properly handle level triggered gpio interrupts

For level triggered gpio interrupts we need to use handle_fasteoi_irq,
like we do with the irq-sunxi-nmi driver. This is necessary to give threaded
interrupt handlers a chance to actuall clear the source of the interrupt
(which may involve sleeping waiting for i2c / spi / mmc transfers), before
acknowledging the interrupt.
