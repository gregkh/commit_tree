Bluetooth: Update SMP crypto functions to take the SMP context

Passing the full SMP context instead of just the crypto context lets us
use the crypto handle from the context which in turn removes the need to
lock the hci_dev. Passing the SMP context instead of just the crypto
handle allows a bit more detailed logging which is helpful in
multi-adapter scenarios.
