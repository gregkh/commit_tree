arm/arm64: KVM: Fix and refactor unmap_range

unmap_range() was utterly broken, to quote Marc, and broke in all sorts
of situations.  It was also quite complicated to follow and didn't
follow the usual scheme of having a separate iterating function for each
level of page tables.

Address this by refactoring the code and introduce a pgd_clear()
function.
